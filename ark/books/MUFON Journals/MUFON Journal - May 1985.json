These cases involve statements by the witnesses that they experienced a strange, metallic taste during and after a UFO observation at close range. Examples Three hunters in the Ocala National Forest of Florida were looking for a lost deer hound at 9 PM, on December 14, 1975. They spotted a hemispherical object 25 ft. high with five \"legs\" about 12 to 15 ft. long. Emitting a bright blue-white light, it hovered over a power line and then moved away as the witness approached to within about 250 yards. During the half-hour observation, their CB radio failed,'a humming sound was heard, a strange odor hung in the air, and \"...they had a funny metallic taste in their mouths.\" 1 (Emphasis supplied by the present author.) A Canadian case on October 23, 1967, involving 17 witnesses and five objects seems to be relevant, although the details are poorly described. 2 A real estate salesman approached to within 250 yards of one of the objects that landed in a vacant lot of a housing subdivision that was under construction. \"Everything he ate tasted the same and there was a taste of copper or metal in his mouth.\" The objects flew away over some power lines that lighted up and the salesman's car and the tall flagpole at the show house were later found to be magnetized. The author recalls another incident in which .the strange taste reportedly lasted 20 minutes but the reference cannot be located. (Any assistance in finding it and other cases would be appreciated.) These cases imply that some electrical or magnetic fields associated with the UFOs were responsible for inducing the artificial sensation of a metallic taste. A further hint in that direction came from a passing remark about a similar taste that had been experienced by a female friend while undergoing an electrical treatment for removal of excess hair on the jowls. The treatment involved the application of an electrode to the hair root while the opposite electrode was held in one hand. In a later, tape-recorded interview, she said that the electrode was applied \"...on the side of my face and the closer it was to the inside of my mouth, the more I could taste it. It tasted like eating tinfoil.\" In answer to the quetion if the taste lasted very long, she said, \"Well, after I would have the session it would probably last about 5 minutes or so.\" Electrology Electrology is the name for the study and professional practice 'of permanent hair removal that is an application of the electro-chemical process known as electrolysis. It is regulated by law in most' states that establish the academic and experience requirements for licensing. Basically, there are two processes that are used separately or in combination. One is the application of a direct current whereas the other involves an alternating current of high frequency. The frequencies employed are restricted by the Federal Communications Commission to 13.56, 27.12, and 40.68 megahertz (million cycles per second), although most equipment operates at 13.56 megahertz. Passing an electric current through a conducting fluid stimulates chemical reactions that would not otherwise take place. Treatment with direct current utilizes this process. A tiny , needle as a negative electrode is inserted into the follicle of the hair to be removed while the patient holds a damp, cylindrical sponge in one hand which serves as the anode. Passage of a weak current through the patient produces a minute quantity of the hydroxyl ions (OH) near the root. This slightly caustic ion attacks the local tissues preventing regrowth of the hair. The application of high-frequency current is based upon the local generation of heat to achieve the same result. The two processes are sometimes used simultaneously to accelerate the chemical reactions by slightly increasing the temperature. 3 ' 4 As the metallic taste in electrology treatment is of no consequence, References 3 and 4, being the only books on the subject that are presently in print, are silent on that side effect. But through the voluntary and enthusiastic assistance of a licensed electrologist, Mrs. Marianne Zehntner of Belmont, California, a'dditional details were obtained. In her experience, the taste occurred only when using direct current and it was not noted by people who wear dentures, have no dental fillings, or whose fillings are gold. The taste is most prominent during an \"after treatment\" on the lower, portion of the face. This treatment for conditioning the pores is performed with a small, free-rotating, conducting cylinder covered with a layer or two of damp gauze. It is gently rolled over the skin while applying a direct current as the cathode (negative). With much scientific curiosity and a twinge of apprehension, the author undertook such a treatment and duely experienced the sensation as the device was rolled over the cheeks, lips, chin, and especially the jaws. The taste is hard to describe and the word \"metallic\" seemed to be inadequate. There was a tingling component and a strange bitterness. (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"TASTE, Continued The location on the tongue was restricted to the lower edge of the front half where the tongue contacts the lower teeth. The intensity of the effect increased as the current was increased from 1.5 to 3.0 milliamperes. Scientific Data .While technical information on this subject is hard to find, it has been researched quite thoroughly in the physiological study of the sense of taste and an excellent survey article of the field was published 1 in 1971. 5 The phenomenon was discovered by Sulzer a quarter of a century before the Italian physicist Allessandro Volta did his pioneering development of electricity. Sulzer experienced the taste when applying two dissimilar metals that were touching each other to the tongue. Students of physics will recognize that arrangement as a primitive battery with the tongue completing the circuit. The phenomenon was then forgotten and rediscovered in 1792 by Volta, who described .the sensation as definitely sour with the positive pole applied to the tip of the tongue (due to hydrogen ions) but, with the negative pole to the tongue, \"...no longer sour but more alkaline, sharp, nearing bitter.\" Then followed nearly 200 years of progressively more intensive and sophisticated research as the knowledge and theory of electricity expanded and as the science of physiology was born and matured. There was always much difficulty in describing the taste; terms included bitter, alkaline bitter-sweet, bitter- sweet, and sometimes metallic. Here are briefly summarized the scientific facts pertaining to the present injury. Individuals are highly variable in their responses; however, mean thresholds for detection are on the order of 100 microamperes and the sensation gains intensity as the current is increased, in a linear or somewhat stronger dependency. The onset of the taste is almost immediate and reaches full magnitude within a fraction of a second. Upon shutting off the current, however, the sensation does not cease but persists for a long time. A continuous sensation 4 is experienced with direct current pulses as slow as 0.5 per second. Some experiments with alternating current showed that it was hard to detect any taste at frequencies greater than 1,000 Hz. While the cause of the sensation has not been unequivocally established, it appears that the so-called metallic taste at the cathode is a combination of direct action of electricity upon the taste cells and the normal, chemical effect of products of electrolysis. Evaluation The known parameters of \"electric taste\" in the science of physiology are thus seen to correspond quite closely with the side effect from electrology treatments and the reported experiences of some UFO witnesses. And some of these parameters can be useful in inferring the probable stimuli in the UFO cases. A great deal of evidence points toward a compound, electro-magnetic field near UFOs that consists of (a) rapidly-pulsed microwaves 6 in conjunction with (b) a slowly-pulsed, magnetic field. During the open forum period at the Second International Conference sponsored by the Center for UFO Studies in November 1981, the author described the requirements of a magnetic field that would cause a compass to spin steadily, a rather common element in UFO reports. Basically, the field intensity must be on the order of the earth's magnetic field (0.2 gauss) and the pusle rate must synchronize with the compass spin rate. These concepts from physical intuition were later verified by the author in crude, \"poor-boy\" experiments that were instrumental in formation of a group at the MUFON 1983 Symposium to repeat the experiments with scientific precision. The \"poor-boy\" tests showed that a card compass exposed to pulsing fields of roughly 0.1 gauss up to 0.6 gauss caused it to spin steadily at rates ranging from about 35 up to about 125 rpm in proportion to the field strength at its peak value. Corresponding magnetic pusle rates in sync with the compass were 0.58 to 2.1 per second. Much stronger fields were required to spin a liquid-filled compass whose dynamic behavior is dominated by viscous damping by the fluid that is, of course, its primary purpose. Spin rates for a wet compass were much slower, ranging from about 6 to 20 rpm. Corresponding magnetic pulse rates were approximately 0.1 to 0.33 per second. • In, UFO' cases where compass spin rates were measured or where they can be • estimated from the description by the witness, the pulse rate of a magnetic field .that could sustain a steady spin can be inferred directly. For example, suppose that a compass were observed to spin at 15 rpm, the driving pulse rate would be 0.25 per second. , Pulsed magnetic fiels are very likely the cause of spinning compasses because they are sufficient and no competing cause has been suggested. Also, when a simple solution .to a problem is at hand, there is no need to search for a complicated one. Recall that Mrs. Zehntner said that the metallic taste was experienced only with direct current. Furthermore, scientific research has shown that the effect does not occur at frequencies above about 1,000 Hz. Based upon this information, it is possible to ascertain which type of field from UFOs could be responsible. The microwave radiation must be ruled out in favor of a slowly-pulsed, magnetic field. Also recall that DC pulses as slow as 0.5 per second in the scientific studies showed the sensation to be experienced as continuous. Due to the known, long persistence of the taste, even slower pulse rates of the driving current could hardly be detected. How could the requisite current arise in the presence of a UFO? A fundamental concept in electricity is that a moving conductor cutting magnetic field lines will induce a current in the conductor, Stated alternately, transient magnetic field lines moving past a stationary conductor will induce a current in the conductor. • (continued on page 15)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"YAKIMA UFO By Greg Long LENGTH: 75 to 100 FEET Artist's rendition of UFO from Freeland's sketch. During my research into UFO sightings on the Yakima Indian Reservation in south-central Washington state, I'came across the sighting of a Daylight Disc observed in 1971 from a fire lookout station on a mountain outside the Reservation. B. (for Barbara) Ann Slate, a Bigfoot and UFO researcher who published her findings in popular magazines in the mid-1970's (and who died in 1978), began corresponding with W. J. (Bill) Vogel, the UFO investigator on the Reservation, in 1974. Vogel provided Slate with material for articles on UFO and Bigfoot sightings. One of her Saga magazine articles drew a response from Gary B. Freeland, a fire lookout who had spent 18 summers on forest lookout stations in Oregon and Washington. Slate passed Freeland's letter onto Vogel. Freeland's sighting occurred in mid-July 1971. \"I view myself as a credible individual,\" he wrote to Slate in his March 5,1975 letter, \"and not given to rash judgements.... I hold two Master's degrees, have been a teacher for seven years, and for the past 2 l / 2 years have been a guidance counselor. I also have piloted aircraft for 60 hours....\" He described his sighting thus: \"In brief, this is what occurred. The lookout is on [6,300- foot high] Timberwolf Mountain northeast of Mount Adams about 30 air miles [and 24 miles due west of Naches, Washington.] I had just taken a bowl of soup outside the cabin—a ground station—to eat my lunch. The day was exceptionally clear, nary a cloud around. HELICOPTER? \"I sat down on the steps and turned on my radio to hear the noon news— Paul Harvey, I think. I looked up in the direction of Clemens Mountain (it also has a lookout station—state controlled; distance about'8 miles). I then saw what first appeared to be a large helicopter—the double-rotor type with a motor on either end. But the craft made rio thrashing sound as do choppers at that distance. It made absolutely no noise. It simply held a suspended position above the Yakima end of the mountain.... Its altitude appeared to be about 7,500-8,000 feet, which caught my immediate attention. I never had seen a 'copter hover at such a high altitude. Such copters had passed infrequently through the area over the summers I had been on Timberwolf and Little Bald Lookouts. Other types, military and otherwise, had frequented our districts, too. And when they were much farther away, the unmistakable whump-whumpof the rotors could be heard. \"I observed the craft for some 15 seconds. It still didn't move. I got up and ran into my cabin and got my 7.50 x 50 binoculars. For about a full minute, I obseved the craft. It was cigar shaped and silvery except for two dome-like protrusions on opposite edges of the craft. That's why I first believed it to be a double-rotored helicopter. But the domes were rounded, not rectangular as on the helicopters. And there was no rotor evidence, and no sound. The craft turned slightly as to reveal the sun glinting on its silvery side. Too, the craft was thinner than the helicopters I've seen. You see, I lived for a couple of years in Imperial Beach, California, smack up to the helicopter training base at Ream Field. And I've seen and heard those damn choppers day and night for all too long a time. I know well what they sound and look like. At 8 to 10 miles they're terribly loud. Even when nearly out of'sight they're quite loud. If what I saw had been an airplane or a helicopter, it would have drifted away slowly enough so I could have followed it with the binoculars. But not this. It simply disappeared; that is, I lowered my glasses a second, raised them again, and the craft was gone! I never reported the sighting to authorities, except for my boss at the ranger station.\" RECONFIRMED Recently I managed to make telephone contact with Freeland 13 years after his UFO sighting. Freeland's memory of the incident was remarkably clear, down to the details of who was on the radio, the time, what he was eating for lunch, and the 60-second duration of •(continued on page 15)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Cover Story THE METEOR CONNECTION By Luis Schoenherr In a recent article in the Journal* the authors have speculated, whether the temporal correlation of UFO sightings and satellite re-entries is \"coincidence or cunning\". They suggest it could be the modus operands of extraterrestrial visitors to use re- entry phenomena in order to mask their own operations. In this connection it may be pointed out that there have also been cases of UFO sightings correlated with meteoritic falls. I have never made a systematic search for such cases, but when reading the article cited above, I immediately recalled two American sightings: STOCKTON, KANSAS At approximately 3:50 p.m. (MST), February 18, 1948, at the onset of or just before the Norton County meteoritic fall, 2 a Stockton farmer claimed he saw \"a strange saucer wobbling over his home\". He said further: \"When it came within six feet of him it stopped in the air, level with his face, and wobbled around for an instant with fire belching out, and then being sucked back in. It was about four feet long and shaped like a funnel. Sparks suddenly showered from it and the fire increased as if a fuse had been lit. It took off in a northwest direction, very fast, gaining altitude as it went. My wife came out and watched it fly off, leaving a trail of smoke. On a sudden, a great cloud of smoke appeared in the sky and in a few seconds, we heard a terrible explosion. I could feel the heat from where the object came near the ground.\" 3 CROUTER FARM, NEBRASKA On July 28,1968, at approximately 2:00 p.m. (i.e., about the time of the Omaha Fireball: 1:45 p.m.), the railroad engineer William C. Rogers observed a tear-drop shaped phenomenon of light, 100 feet from him at the height of the power lines, which cross the farm. While the observer watched, it burst 6 open and disintegrated into fragments of light. The phenomenon made no noise nor did it leave physical traces. It did also not move. The sky was cloudless and sunny and the incident lasted \"a small number of seconds\". Later the witness corrected his distance estimate to 200 yards, a still later measurement resulted in 750 feet. 4 DISCUSSION The wording of the Stockton report renders the impression that two separate events are described and that the observers were in an environment familiar to them, Nothing is known about their eyesight and credibility. But if the report is not an outright hoax or has not been fabricated by mentally deranged people, it is worthy of being considered. I'm wearing glasses, but I cannot imagine that I would, in broad daylight and in front of my house, mistake a meteoritic phenomenon dozens of miles away, for an object six feet from me and level with my face. And what about the heat the farmer felt \"where the object came near the ground\"? The only item in accordance with the hypothesis of a misidentifi- cation of the meteoritic event is the direction of flight (northwest) of the UFO. One may also get the impression that the importance of visual defects for the reliability of an observation is often overemphasized. People who have such defects are usually well aware of them by long experience and know how far they can trust their eyes. There are carefully designed optical experiments which seem to prove how easily human perception is fooled. But actual observational situations are not like carefully designed optical illusions. There is, for example, a distinct difference in the sensory quality of close up observations and observations of things far away. This is due to the human ability of stereoscopic sight, which makes distance estimates in a range of 2 to 4 meters possible without external reference points or knowledge of the nature of the observed object. Quite unconscious movements of the eyes, the head or the. body together with the use of secondary criteria like perspective, shadows, definition and external reference points, can enlarge this range considerably. Contrary to the Stockton sighting, the Rogers Case has been well investigated. It was established that the angle between the observer's bearing and the course of the meteorite was about 15 degrees. This and the short duration of the event could perhaps (perhaps!) explain why no motion was observed if the witness had actually seen the meteorite. But then, if the witness had really looked at such an acute angle towards the meteorite, why had he not seen the meteor trail, but insisted the sky was clear and cloudless?. This puzzled even the investigator. In the course of the investigation the witness admitted he could have been in error as to his original distance estimate. But it was only during the investigation, that he learned of the meteoritic fall. .It is therefore equally possible that this led the witness to distrust his original estimate. It is interesting that the investigator himself has not discounted the possibility that Roger's first estimate might have been correct. In view of all this, years ago I tried to persuade the investigator of this case to also look into the Stockton sighting. But he declined, apparently in view of the elapsed time and the presumed unreliability of the available account. UFO CORRELATIONS For there to be unambiguous correlations of UFO sightings with re- entry and meteoritic phenomena, the following requirements must be (continued on page 15)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"UFO ROUNDUP By John Schuessler Probation officer Andrew Child and his wife Pam, a social worker, spotted a flying doughnut over Dorset, England in December 1984. They said \"it was grey, doughnut-shaped, with a ring around the middle, and was at least the size of an aircraft.\" They claimed it hovered at a 5000- feet altitude for 10 minutes, long enough to them to summon other witnesses. Although the object was clearly visible at the time the witnesses said they could see no markings of any kind. What did they think it was — \"we are convinced it was a flying saucer.\" Within a few days of the Dorset sighting a couple in Hunstanton said a large flying disc hovered over the road in front of their car. They said: \"it was dome-shaped and it was all lit up a glowing orange color. It. was fluorescent. It seemed to be moving slowly but without noise.\" The couple claimed they were not frightened, just excited. Another UFO was reported on Christmas Eve by a lorry driver in Leeds. James Lenehan said he was walking his dog when he saw \"a red airship.\" He said the sky was red when the airship came down to land behind the Kirkstall Museum. Someone said he saw Santa Claus making his annual rounds. ORANGE BALL Similar sightings were occurring across the English Channel about the same time. Police in the Doubs region of France reported a number of calls about UFOs. A round object hovered over Lomont late in the afternoon on November 28. The next day a young woman reported a dark orange ball over the Mont-Bart forest. Other sightings were similar. One newspaper said: \"five witnesses, five different persons . observing very strange phenomena from different locations. And not the slightest recognized scientific evidence.\" How can it be ignored? The people have a right to know PLANT INSPECTION Thousands of people report UFOs passing over their homes and chasing their cars, and occasionally someone claims to have been taken for a ride in one of the mysterious objects. Once in a while, however, the UFOs ignore the witnesses to critically inspect a military installation, power plant or other seat of human technology. This is one of those stories. The famed Center for UFO Studies in Evanston, Illinois, ran this copyright 1984 story in their newsletter. Although all rights to the story were reserved by the Center, they permitted this interesting account of a UFO inspecting the Boeing Aircraft plant in Renton, Washington. A man and wife living atop a hill overlooking the plant about one mile away said they saw lights hovering over the south end of the plant. At first they believed the lights to be from a helicopter, but .soon changed their mind as their experience became a close encounter. NO HELICOPTER The lights shot up in the air briefly and moved to the north end of the plant. After a moment they left the Boeing plant and flew right up to the witnesses , stopping only 300 yards away. It definitely was not a helicopter. The, UFO was circular with a curved top and sloping sides and about 50 feet in diameter and 15 feet thick. Windows encircled the craft and images could be seen moving around inside. Someone or something was piloting the craft. An amber light was located directly in the center of the top and the light from inside resembled a fluorescent light. The witness said he studied the object as intently as possible as it hung there in the sky. It seemed to be constructed of a light-weight metal and seemed to give off a little glow making it easy to observe. He said there was no sound at all. MANUFACTURED After a few minutes the UFO started to move away toward Lake Washington and had disappeared over the trees in about four seconds, but not without convincing the witnesses it was real. He said: \"I had a good chance to study this thing and I'm sure it was...made by an intellectual.;..maybe somebody smarter than us....and it was a mechanical gadget, is what I'd call it. It was manufactured. It was no reflection or image or anything like that because that's what I wanted to be sure of. This was a mechanical machine.\""},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"HIGHER DIMENSIONS By Daniel Eden The Berkeley educated, cosmic ray physicist, Dr. Karl A. Brunstein has courageously lifted the lid off a Pandora's Box by publishing his remarkable book, Beyond The Four Dimensions: Reconciling Physics, Parapsychology and UFOs (Walker And Company, 1979). Dr. Brunstein is offering an intellectual challenge to physics and to the still infant sciences of parapsychology and ufology to open their minds to the possibility of physically real higher spaces. With the awesome intuition of a modern Sherlock Holmes, he draws upon some of the bizarre clues that seem to link our four-dimensional world (height + length + width + time =4-D) to that of a greater world of five or more dimensions. From the dreamy halls of Einstein's Princeton retreat to the coffee-stained papers on the desks of the world's ingenious particle physicists, the data that hints of a higher space is beginning to show its hand. It's popping up everywhere! And as in physics and parapsychology, Dr. Brunstein shows that the little lame waif that is ufology is also reluctantly shuffling forward with the signposts to multiple dimensions. SHAPE CHANGERS For instance, consider the many bizarre reports of UFOs that exhibit what Dr. J. Allen Hynek calls \"strangeness\". Metallic-appearing UFOs might saunter by a crowd of startled witnesses only to wink out of existence like a blown light bulb. In other cases they might fade gradually from view like some special-effects segment on a Star Trek movie. Sometimes UFOs are seen to race across the horizon while mysteriously changing their shapes in-transit, like those little toy cars that transform into robots with a flick of the wrist. This very high strangeness can send a classical scientist scuttling back to his more mundane activities like a sand crab fleeing back into the safety of the ocean. But not every scientist runs 8 away. Dr. Brunstein calmly investigates, and analyzes, and then concludes that, \"...a device moving about in accordance with the physical laws of a five-dimensional world and taking full advantage of that extra dimension — could be fully expected to manifest itself to us with just such a complement of mysteries.\" Even the very conservative Dr. Hynek has been known to admit, within the pages of OMNI and Technology Review, that the higher space approach is at least one of the viable concepts that might help us to understand the UFO data. Other scientists are beginning to speak out on this possibility as well. While others, of course, just as strongly disagree. DISSENT One strongly dissenting viewpoint comes from Robert Sheaffer who is sometimes called a \"ufological theoretician\" by one of his more dewey- eyed admirers. In his book, The UFO Verdict (Prometheus Books, 1981) Sheaffer seems very resentful that ufologists might have an interest in higher space theories. With an irritated sniff at Dr. Hynek's candor, he tartly quips \"When Hynek speculates that UFOs, absurdities and all, are somehow penetrating into our dimension (sic) from some other level of reality, on what grounds could he possibly dismiss a sighting of the Easter Bunny?\" A much more rational criticism comes from the cryptozoologist J. Richard Greenwell. In an excellent article in Ronald Story's, The Encyclopedia of UFOs (Dolphin/ Doubleday Books, 1980), Greenwell criticized higher dimensional theories, in general, for not having an \"observational window\" by which one could evaluate the reasonableness of the models. However, others would argue that it is the UFO, itself, that is the observational window just as subatomic particles are the windows utilized by the particle physicists. Another cryptozoologist, Jon Beckjord, offers a nice analogy for our consideration in CUFOS* The Journal of UFO Studies Vol. Ill, 1983. He says \"Thus the next time we read of a UFO suddenly 'winking out'.... let's consider how a water strider insect views a rock being thrown in his pond. It sees not the flight of the rock:... all it sees in its plane of existence is the splash at entry. Are we much different?\" Clearly the \"splash\", as he puts it, is an \"observational window\" and the thing that is doing the splashing is precisely what all serious ufologists are vigorously striving to understand. From a series of careful measurements dealing with the nature of the watery splash, a little water-insect physicist could determine a whole host of useful features about his watery surface- space. He could indirectly determine the viscosity of the water, maximum wave velocities, and so forth. Permit me to reiterate Mr. Beckjord: \"Are we any different?\" HIGHER SPACE REAL? With or without the support of such ufological theoreticians as Mr. Easter Bunny, the creative mathema- ticians and physicists of our time are delving deeply into notions of higher space. Perhaps the brilliant scientists who converged on the Second New Orleans Conference on Quantum Theory and Gravitation in 1983, could have used an Easter Rabbit for their mascot. Using abstract models with as many as 8- ,10- , and 12-dimensional spaces, they proved that higher space theories are really much more than Sheaffer's bunny analysis would suggest. Such theories can make testable, observable, predictions that can give us a greater insight into the mysteries of quantum phenomena, relativity, and maybe someday, ufology. Are these multiple dimensions (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"DIMENSIONS, Continued physically real entities? Dietrick E. Thomsen reported in Science News, July 7, 1984, that the scientists \"are usually noncommittal about whether the extra dimensions are physically real or merely mathematical artifacts.... However, several of the others who spoke.... tended to talk as if the dimensions were real.\" The issue is further complicated by the fact that in some of the models the higher dimensions are topologically wrapped around subatomic particles in a closed fashion so as to deliberately prevent any hyperdimensional inter- actions being predicted on a macroscopic level. However, by simply loosening up, or even dropping some of the more arbitrary restrictions on the models, .it may be possible to encompass macroscopic phenomena, such as UFOs. Many advanced models do not use the limiting restrictions of wrapped-off topologies and these models may be of . more immediate interest to theoretical ufologists.. For instance, the brilliant, young mathematician Simon Donaldson, at Oxford University, has developed intriguing mathematical arguments,, that suggest other 4-D worlds can exist independently of our own 4-D world. Clearly, this could have practical implications for ufology,. If you have a strong background in advanced matrix mechanics on n-dimensional maniforlds, you might want to seek him out to see if he has any positive ideas to offer to struggling, advanced-theory ufologists, if there are. such pitiful creatures. HYPERDIMENSIONS Not everyone has a graduate-level mathematical background to help them ferret ,out the useful elements of the more technical models. Nevertheless, many practical hyperdimensional concepts are. easily within the reach of the researcher with an average intelligence who has a minimal math background. For instance, the award- winning science-fiction author, (and mathematician) Rudy Rucker has written some wonderful little books, heavily illustrated, on the subjects of higher space. With his fortuitous background in math, writing, teaching, cartooning and the reading of obscure sources, Rudy Rucker is one of the most literate, and intelligible, popularizers that the subject has ever had. I strongly urge the interested reader to prowl the local library for his books. As with the emergence of any radically new way of looking at the world, the first applications,of higher dimensional concepts to ufology will be fraught with errors, mistakes in reasoning, simple dead ends and heavy doses of criticism. However, I urge all serious ufologists to strive for openmindedness, or at least tolerance, towards those first pioneers who, like Dr. Brunstein, have the ironclad courage to take the first steps into these waters of unknown depths.

Location of, Witnesses: near the northeast corner of the Light Street Pavilion at the Inner Harbor of Baltimore (see map). Mfnesses: known witnesses are Bruce and Christine Maccabee. Probable witnesses are several hundred other people who were facing east while listening to the concert; possible other witnesses are the several thousand other people who were in the Inner Harbor area that evening. Other reports: none known to me. Weather and Environment: clear blue sky with faint cloud wisps; sunset at 7:35; temperature in the 70's; light south, wind at ground level. (Note: official surface weather observations from Baltimore, obtained from .the National Weather Service, indicate that the weather conditions were essentially constant during the afternoon and evening of Sept. 2. At 7:52 PM the cloud cover is listed as 25000-scattered. The visibility was 12 miles. The wind was from the southwest [230°] at 5 knots. The upper altitude wind data at 6:00 PM from Sterling, Virginia, about 50 miles southwest of 'Baltimore, • show that from about 1000 to about 3000ft. the wind direction varied from southwest to west [about 220° to 270°] with speeds ranging from 15 to 20 knots. From about 4000ft. to about 22,000ft. the wind was from the west-northwest [in the range 290° to 300°] at speeds ranging from about 20 to about 34 knots. At even higher altitudes the wind was from the west.) Direction when first seen: about 170° azimuth from true north; see 1 on map. Direction when last seen: about 72° azimuth; see 5 on map. 10 Apparent path: the object traversed a total of about 100 degrees of azimuth from about 170° to about 72°. The elevation increased from about 15° when first seen to a maximum of about 35 to 40°, based on comparison with the approximately 30° angular elevations of , the top of the mast of the Constellation and the top of the World Trade Center Building. At that time the azimuth was about 118? (see 2 on map)., The elevation then decreased to about 25° when the object disappeared behind the Trade Center at an azimuth of about 96°. The elevation at reappearance on the north side of the Center, at an azimuth of about 85°, was much lower, perhaps 15°. Finally the elevation reached about 10°, remaining nearly constant during the last couple of minutes of. observation when the object was definitely farther away than the Trade Center building, i.e., farther than 800 ft. Characrerisincs of the object: it first appeared as a dark spot and it remained black as it grew in angular size. The outline (silhouette) against the sky continually changed, seeming to go through a cycle from generally round to generally elliptical or cigar-shaped. No brightness gradations were noted within the outline of the object in spite of a concerted effort on my part to see gradations or reflections of sunlight or something that would imply \"solidity\" (three-dimensionality) of the object. It was last seen as a barely distinguishable black dot against the sky. Angular size: varied during the sighting. I estimate 1 to 2 milliradians at its largest, based on camparison with my small finger size during the sighting and upon subsequent tests with a millimeter ruler held at arms length. Shape: the shape seemed to change continually. Most of the time the object appeared as a slightly distorted black disc (i.e., generally round). However, several times the overall shape of the object changed in a continuous manner from round to elliptical or cigar-shaped. When this happened there seemed to be a very slight protrusion at the top. Other things in the sky: bird at various distances; passenger jet aircraft; half moon in the southeast- Sound: none noted. Rapid movements: none noted. Color: none (black). Effects on environment: hone noted* Visual acuity of the (main) witness: able to detect a black spot on white paper if the angular size is about 0.2 mr (milliradian) or larger; can detect gross shape (outline) if the angular size is 0.5 mr or larger; can easily discern shapes if the angular size is 1 mr or greater. TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS Initially both the angular elevation and the angular size of the object increased while the azimuth changed from about 170° to about 118°. These sorts of changes are consistent with an essentially level trajectory that would put the closest point of approach along the (approximately) 118° azimuth. Subsequently the angular size and angular elevation decreased, although the azimuth did not change as rapidly. These subsequent changes are consistent with a level trajectory that would take the object away to the east. The actual range to the object at any time is not known, nor is'its actual size. Therefore one can do no more than construct a family of curves representing likely trajectories at varying distances. Several possible constant height/constant size trajectories were configurated, but are not shown. Of course, if one allows for the possibility that the size and/or height were not constant, then one could imagine many different types of trajectories. (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"BLACK UFO, Continued PROPOSED EXPLANATIONS 1) bird: It was not the correct shape although the angular size of the object was large enough so that wings, head, and body would have been resolved, based on comparing actual birds with the object. 2) kite: The flight dynamics were impossible for a kite since a kite is tethered. The shape did not coincide with that of a kite. 3) aircraft: A helicopter or other type of plane should have been easily recognized at the angular size of the object. 4) balloon: The general wind directions at various altitudes (generally southwest near the surface to generally west above several thousand feet) is consistent with the initial generally northward direction of motion of the object and with the subsequent northeast direction. Specifically, one might assume that the balloon was being blown generally toward the northeast at an altitude below 2000 ft. when it was first seen. As it climbed from, say, 1500 to 2500 ft. the wind changed its direction to nearly eastward. One might also assume that at the point of maximum angular elevation it was about 2500 ft. high and that by the time it disappeared behind the Trade Center building it was almost 3000 ft. high and heading eastward. A consequence of assuming that the hypothetical balloon was at about 2500 ft. altitude at the ' point of maximum angular elevation (direction 2 on the map) places it at a (radial) distance of about 2500/sin35 = 4360 ft., and this distance requires a balloon diameter of more than 4 ft. corresponding to an angular size of 1 mr or 'more. Obviously varying the assumed altitude by a few hundred feet (e.g., higher or lower than 2500 ft.) would result in variations in the required balloon size. Considering the size one might assume that what was seen was a moderately large (round) black pilot balloon. Although one may point to a rough overall consistency between the observational data and any one of a number of trajectories suggested by the balloon hypothesis, when one begins to consider the finer details of a particular trajectory that seems to be mutually consistent with the weather data and the observational'data, one may find inconsistencies. For example, consider a trajectory which has been chosen to give reasonable agreement with the observed trajectory from the time of the initial sighting to the time of the maximum elevation and to be consistent with the weather data. Assume that the balloon was at an altitude around 1500 ft. when it was first seen in the south at an angular elevation of about 15°. At this elevation the wind would have been blowing the balloon toward the northeast at a speed of about 16 knots, according to the weather data. An altitude of 1500 ft. and an elevation of 15° corresponds to a (radial) range of about 5800 ft. At this range the angular size would have been smaller than when the balloon was at the 2500 ft. altitude and 4360 ft away, so the angular size would have increased continually from the time of first observation to the time of maximum elevation. To reach the 2500 ft. altitude in the first minute and a half of observation time would require an ascension velocity of 1000 ft. in 1.5 min. or 670 ft./min., which is on the high side of what is expected for a typical several- foot diameter balloon, but which is probably acceptable. So far, so good. NO BALLOON From initial observation to the time of maximum elevation the azimuth changed by about (170-118=) 52° and the elevation changed by 1000 ft. By using some trigonometry and the law of cosines one finds that the linear distance between the initial point of observation and the point of maximum angular elevation is about 4500 ft. The distance along any other path (e.g., a path curved by the changing wind direction) would be longer. The wind speeds in the altitude range 1500-2500 ft. were around 12 knots (= 12 nautical miles/hr.; 1 nautical mile = 6077 ft.) or (continued next page) 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"BLACK UFO, Continued about 1200 ft./min. To travel more than 4500 ft., then, would require more than 3.8 minutes, not the 1.5 minutes that is consistent with the observational data. In other words, this hypothesis fails because to make it fit the observations one must assume a wind speed that is more than twice the actually measured speed. Using a similar calculation method one can show that in order for the hypothetical balloon to disappear at an angular elevation of 25° about 30 seconds after it was at its maximum angular elevation, the wind speed between 2500 and 3000 ft. would have to be about 61 knots. The actual wind speed in that altitude range was less than 20 knots (the highest measured wind speed at any altitude was 47 knots at 44000 ft.). Thus again the balloon hypothesis fails. After analyzing a number of similar trajectories I conclude that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to find a balloon trajectory that is mutually consistent with the available upper altitude wind data and also with the observational data. Besides the problem of finding a satisfactory trajectory, there is the problem that even a black balloon should have a brightness gradation in sunlight and perhaps even a glint, but this object had no such brightness gradation within its outline, so far as I could tell. Another important reason for rejecting the balloon hypothesis is the nature of the continual change of the shape of the outline. The shape change was not consistent with the constant round or teardrop shape of a balloon, even though a balloon rocks back and forth as it rises. If I had only seen the object for a short period of time (less than 30 sec.) I might be satisfied with the free-floating black balloon hypothesis. However, after watching it go through its unusual cycle of shape change and after failing to detect any brightness gradations at all within the outline over a period of more than a minute and after pondering the requirements imposed upon the balloon hypothesis by the observed 12 1-170°; 2-118°; 3-96°; 4-85°; 5-72° trajectory, I find it exceedingly difficult to accept the idea that the object was a balloon. MORE BLACK UFOS At the time of my sighting. it seemed to me that black UFOs had been reported before, but I could not remember any particular sightings except a few photographic cases in which portions of the photographed objects were dark or black. I did not remember reading about any sightings similar to my own. After I had completed the above report I made a brief search of the literature and was surprised to find that black objects had been seen long before my sighting. In fact, the first report of a black object in the sky was made by a reporter, Dave Johnson, in July 1947. He was fying in a small plane looking for \"flying saucers\" to confirm Arnold's sighting when he saw a black object come out of a distant cloud. He photographed the object but it was too distant to make a useful image on the film. While reading through early reports recently released by the Army I came, quite by chance, upon the following report, which has never before been published. The report was made by Norman H. Brown, Acting Chief, Review and Analysis Section, Atomic Energy Commission. It was filed as an \"Air Space Violation at Oak Ridge, Tennessee\" on July 27, 1953. The report reads as follows: \"At approximately 3:00 PM on July 19, 1953, an F-86 aircraft was observed flying over Oak Ridge residential area, making circles at what appeared to the writer to be approximately 2,500 to 3,500 ft. The F-86 flew over the area in this manner for approximately ten or fifteen minutes. The writer, together with his wife, observed the aircraft through a pair of six power field glasses. After the aircraft flew in what appeared to be the direction of Knoxville, Tennessee, a black object moved out of a high white cloud, directly over the > area the F-86 had been flying. This object began to travel at a tremendous speed, in a large circle. \"This action on the part of the unknown object continued for at least five minutes. During the circle of this object, it appeared at times to be in the shape of a cigar and at other times round. This object was (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"BLACK UFO, Continued extremely black in color, having an appearance of a deep black metal exterior with a fine gloss. It did not leave a vapor trail or were there any lights shine (sic) noticed. No sound was heard. The object flew east at a tremendous speed for what appeared to be approximate- ly three miles where it stopped. The objects (sic) was then joined by two more of these same objects. A formation similar to a spread 'V was formed and the objects, at a tremendous speed flew in an eastward direction.\" Upon reading this report I was struck in particular by the description of the blackness of the object and also by the description of the object looking round part of the time and cigar-shaped part of the time. BLACK ELLIPTOID I found another detailed report in the book UFOS: INTERPLANETARY VISITORS by Raymond Fowler (Exposition Press, Jericho, NY, 1974). Fowler described a sighting by his brother on October 1, 1964. His brother reported: \"I had just driven into the rear parking lot of Sylvania on Endicott Street in Danvers. I was accompanied by two friends who were returning from lunch with me. We remained in the car talking for a few minutes when Mr. T. called our attention to a jet airliner flying over. One moment later, I looked up to see a dark, elliptical shaped object passing through the sky in front of and below a large cumulous cloud. \"At first I thought it was a sea gull, and since both Mr. T. and Mr. E. knew of my interest in UFOs, I jokingly said 'Look, there goes a flying disc.' In a few seconds, I realized that it was not a gull and immediately tried to get Mr. T. to look at it. (Mr. E. was in the rear seat and had little opportunity to catch sight of it.) Mr. T. never got a close look at it. It looked metallic and elliptical in shape, like a phonograph record seen at an angle.\" Fowler reports that his brother made reasonably careful estimates of the angle of elevation (30 deg) and the apparent, diameter (3/16 of an inch at arms length which corresponds to about 0.008 radians or about 27 min of arc.) His brother had estimated that the object had been about 500 feet below the bottom level of the clouds, which were at about 2,500 feet according to the Weather Service. Using the estimated elevation and altitude the range is estimated as (2000/sin30=) 4000 feet, and the diameter is then estimated as (2000/sin30=) 32 feet. Fowler also estimated that the speed was about 300 mph. There may be more explicitly described daylight sightings of black objects in the literature, but I am not aware of any. I do know, however, that as of the end of 1952 the Air Force had recorded 12 sightings of 7 black objects (Project Blue Book special Report # 14). NICAP listed 57 sightings as of 1964. Unfortunately a number of these sightings are probably of dark objects seen at night, so whether they were actually black or not could not be determined from many of these reports. After I had completed this appendum I read of another interesting report of a black object. The report, entitled \"Minnesota Flying Black Hamburger,\" is published in the CUFOS Associate Newsletter (Center for UFO Studies, Lima, Ohio 45802; Dec.-Jan., 1984/85). The report was received at CUFOS within weeks of the sighting on Sept. 2, 1982. The main witness was a former Army air traffic controller who claimed that he had seen \"many things in the air including sun dogs, 'skyhook' balloons, meteors, auroras, weather balloons, parachutes and a wide variety of aircraft.\" At about 7:15 PM Central Daylight Time he was standing outside his garage. The sky was clear and the sun had not yet set. He heard the engine of a light aircraft and looked into the sky, seeing a small plane. Looking away from the plane he chanced to see another moving object about the same apparent size as the airplane, and possibly lower. He reported \"My first thought was that it was a balloon being towed by the aircraft. That theory was shot down when the track of the object turned from due east to about 110 degrees, true. It maintained the same speed, that is (matching) the pace of the aircraft, probably 80 to 90 knots. There was a westerly wind at the time.\" The witness watched the object travel into the distance. He estimated that the total sighting duration was about 3 minutes. He described the object as hamburger-shaped with a black top and a black bottom (the \"buns\") and a shiny central (\"equatorial\") part (i.e., the \"beef). Specifically he stated: \"The bottom and top of the object were a jet black and probably a gloss finish. The equatorial band was metallic high- polished silver with a hint of rainbow reflections characteristic of diffraction grating material. The band also appeared to be recessed slightly, or at least gave that visual impression.\" He described the motion as \"smooth, holding the equator parallel to the ground with a few wobbles that reminded one of the precession of a top.\" He heard no sound from the object.

From 1967 and on through the 1970s, a major flap of \"mutes\"-reports of cattle mutilations-swept Colorado and neighboring states, and to some extent across the country and into Canada. More than 10,000 animals, mostly cows, allegedly died bizarre deaths and showed wounds cut with \"surgical\" precision. Some of these deaths were linked to mysterious helicopters or UFOs. At the 1983 MUFON conference in Pasadena, Peter A. Jordan presented a paper on his investigation of the issue, a paper particularly valuable because he had expected to find evidence of \"mutilations\" but instead concluded that they could be explained as normal damage by predators. In Mute Evidence, authors Daniel Kagan and Ian Summers do a similar but considerably more extensive job of investigation. They have talked with everyone they could find who had any connection with the phenomenon-the ranchers who reported the \"mutes,\" the sheriffs and others who investigated them, the newspaper and TV people who reported them, the pathologists knowledgeable about the physiology of what happens when an animal dies, and apparently anyone else who had anything to say. To illustrate the thoroughness of their research: one of the authors (Kagan) interviewed Leo Sprinkle, a UFO enthusiast best known for conducting hypnosis, although he had only a peripheral conenction with cattle mutilations. Kagan wanted to learn more about Sprinkle, so he allowed Sprinkle to hypnotize him. Sprinkle blew it: he blatantly confabulated a suggestion that Kagan add some UFO imagery to his hypnotically-produced story, which had no connection with UFOs; the interruption jarred Kagan out of his deep trance and left him with an insight on how Sprinkle produces so many \"abduction\" and other UFO tales from the people he hypnotizes. 14 Butchered bull in Isla Mujeres, Mexico •photograph by Wendy Smith The book's conclusions: • Virtually all the reported mutilations are the result of predators and other natural causes. • A very few animals might have been cut by pranksters responding to extensive publicity on \"mutilations,\" and a very few might have been the result of \"cult\" activity-no final conclusion could be reached on the cult possibility. • Much of the concern about \"mutilation\" stemmed from greatly exaggerated stories in newspapers and on television. Part of this came from fact-bending, such as by the sheriff who claimed a dead cow was found in a tree (where it must have been placed by a UFO or other aircraft) when it was actually found at the base of the tree (where it was probably killed by lightning). • The heart of the \"mutilation\" phenomenon was \"a crew of UFO buffs who had branched out to specialize in cattle mutilations (pp. 487).\" • There was simply no evidence for any of the other suggested \"explanations\"- chemical warefare experiments, radiation and pollutant monitoring, psychological warfare and other \"secret conspiracy\" theories. • Above all, the \"mute flap\" demonstrates how the power of the media interacting with an idea that many people would like to believe came together to create a movement that acquired a life of its own, even though the basic assumptions were never verified. That figure of 10,000 mutilated animals\" also turned out to be a ballpark guesstimate one mutilation buff had dreamed up, although the number of reports was not even remotely near that. I found this book an impressive study not just of the phenomenon but of how to investigate such a phenomenon. The authors ran down every lead and they report everything they learned-- the book runs over 500 pages. Believers in \"mutology\" won't like the conclusion. But they will find it hard to come up with an alternative explanation, given the thoroughness of this study. -Robert Wanderer MUFON AMATEUR RADIO NET EVERY SATURDAY MORNING AT O8OO EST (OR DST) ON 7237 KHz S.S.B."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"TASTE, Continued Summary and Conclusion Taste sensations reported by UFO witnesses at close range are in complete accord with the sensations experienced by patients taking electrology treatments. The latter are produced only by direct current and scientific research has shown that the sensation does not occur at high frequency. Consequently, the UFO witnesses must have been exposed to a magnetic field that induced a current in their bodies that functioned as antennas. As only transient fields are effective, they must have been pulsed; the intermittent stimuli cannot be detected by taste. From crude experiments with spinning compass driven by magnetic pulses, the pulse rates from UFOs have been determined to within a rather narrow band. The same experiments yielded rough estimates of the field strengths required to drive a compass at a given speed. Precise knowledge of these two parameters is expected from the current research by the MUFON Southern California group. Also, further insights may be obtained from the application of antenna theory to calculate the conditions necessary for the magnetic field to induce a minimum detectable current. In a word, UFO witnesses who reported a strange, metallic taste in their mouths may have been exposed to pulsed, magnetic fields that produced a well-known phenomenon. REFERENCES 1.

He also pinpointed exactly the location of the object. He did add a detail not in the 1975 letter: the surface of the object seemed to be made of metal sheets as if riveted together. He emphasized, as in the letter, the lack of sound and lack of rotors, windows or markings. I also found Freeland's original supervisor, Walter Tokarczyk, who remembered Freeland well. He described the fire lookout as responsible who never reported UFOs, although he did not remember this particular sighting. Tokarczyk, now retired, recalled no other UFO reports from fire lookouts he supervised. What did Freeland see? The clear July sky eliminates a cloud as a possibility, leaving aircraft as a candidate. Yet this aircraft, it we accept Freeland's detailed description, was not manmade, or at least did not fit the common catalog of manmade aerial craft. Could the soundless aspect be a \"mistake\": Freeland only thought that helicopters could be heard up to 8 miles away? Could the UFO have been a helicopter hovering out of hearing range? If so, how do we explain its disappearance? Could it have moved in the interim between the dropping of the binoculars and the raising of them, having blended into the background? That is the only explanation I can conceive. METEOR, Continued fulfilled: 1. The type of the UFO sighting must be such that it can, under no circumstances, be ascribed to a misidentified re-entry or meteor. 2. The temporal correlation of such sighting types with re-entry or meteoritic phenomena must be statistically significant. 3. It must be possible to exclude any natural, causal connection between both events. The authors of> the aforementioned article speculate that there is an extraterrestrial intelligence with the desire to mask their own operations cunningly and with the necessary sociological insight to accomplish this. But this would in itself make any test of requirement (2) very difficult or even render it useless, because our hypothetical extraterrestrials would probably be wise enough to limit the extent of their visits during re-entries to a statistically insignificant level. Regarding requirement (3) it must be mentioned that there is scant evidence that meteoritic falls (and re- entries too?) sometimes cause secondary magnetic and electrical phenomena. 5 6 7 But no matter whether UFOs correlated with re-entries of satellites or meteoritic falls are regarded as geophysical phenomena or as the manifestations of an extraterrestrial intelligence, it seems that a more extensive and systematic search for such correlations is justified.

Allen Hynek. The aritcle was both interesting and informative. Being a member of MUFON and an Associate of C.U.F.O.S., I have the highest respect and esteem for Dr. Hynek and his dedication to trying to find an answer to the UFO enigma. It is persons such as Dr. Hynek and Mr. Walter Andrus that gives credibility to UFOLOGY, and encouragement to all of us who are seeking a solution to the puzzle, and trying to fit together the pieces of information which have been gleaned from the UFO sighting reports, as one would work a jigsaw puzzle. It would be interesting if you would also conduct an interview with the founder of MUFON, Mr. Walter Andrus, and enlighten your readers on how he came to be interested in the subject of the UFO phenomenon, and how he came to form the Mutual UFO Network, for he, too, has contributed much in his dedication to seeking to resolve the UFO enigma, and forming a network of members working together towards this goal. Perhaps later on, you could consider interviews with others who are leaders in this field. Mrs. Shirley Lynch, State Section Director, Georgia Dear Editor, In the February, 1985 issue of the Journal, Jim McCampbell presented the case for microwave emissions from UFOs. Jim has long championed the analysis of close encounter physical effects as a basis for establishing the reality and nature of these objects, and I have the greatest respect for his work. Nevertheless, I believe that the anecdotal and other evidence indicate instead the presence of low frequency magnetic fields. Two primary reasons present themselves. 16 First, the anecdotal evidence points to a number of effects explainable only by induction (low frequency) fields. Conversely, I am aware of no effects which can be explained solely by RF (radio frequency) fields such as microwaves. Oscillating magnetic fields can disturb magnetic compasses. Microwaves can exhibit no such influence. Powerful magnetic fields can cause road signs to vigrate, microwaves cannot. In previous articles (MUFON Journal 194 and 197) the present author has shown that the heating of finger rings and watch bands, and possibly subsurface heating of soil beneath hovering UFOs, is attributable to low frequency magnetic fields. Neither effect can be attributed to microwaves. Similarly, magnetic fields can penetrate the hood of an automobile and induce disruptive voltages in the ignition circuit, causing the engine to labor and stop. The hood, however, forms an effective shield against RF, which would have little effect on the engine even if it could get to it. Second, as one moves away from a source of microwaves, their intensity decreases as the square of the distance, as it does from any radio transmitter. A powerful source of microwaves would be \"heard\" for great distances, particularly if airborne. And, there are a lot of receivers on this planet capable of detecting and monitoring its signal. An example of such detectors is military ELINT (Electronic Intelligence). Sadly, there are parts of the world where there are as many ELJNT receivers as commercial AM radios. If UFOs emitted microwaves, everyone would know by now. Conversely, low frequency magnetic fields decrease as the cube of the distance between source and receiver. Because these fields diminish so rapidly, the signal from even a powerful source of such fields would be undetectible within 10 to 20 miles. When one considers how few receivers exist to \"listen\" to such signals (what receivers do exist are generally geomagnetic research stations), one can see how such sources could have eluded detection so far. A famous case frequently cited as an example of microwave emission from UFOs is the 1957 RB47 case. A reconnaissance bomber carrying airborne ELINT tracked UFOs with receivers tuned to 3000 Mhz. Some ufologists have assumed that the objects were emitting this radiation, but since the signals were characteristic of CPS6B air defense radar, it is obvious that the objects were being \"painted\" by ground radar and merely reflecting this energy. I have no theory as to the origin of UFO sounds. Aside from Jim's work, the only serious work done on UFO noises that the author is aware of was due to Regan and Allan (1979 MUFON Symposium). This involved the analysis of sound pulses recorded in Bragg Creek, Alberta. Thus there is some evidence that at least some UFO sounds are indeed acoustic. That dogs and cats may respond unusually to UFO noises is, if true, hardly surprising. Most mechanical sources of sound (as opposed to electronic audio equipment) produce sound rich in harmonics which extend well into the ultrasonic region. The hysterical wailing of dogs when an ambulance or fire truck passes is precisely due to this phenomenon. Joe Kirk Thomas Los Angeles, California Dear Editor, After all these years and tears, I had hoped ufology had learned its lesson regarding light phenomena seen high in skies over a wide area. Good examples: that Romanian ship off the coast of Brazil, or the Chinese cases (confirmed next page)"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"LETTERS, Continued reported (with illustrations) by Paul Dong a few issues back. The lesson, which I weary of reiterating to a deliberately deaf audience, is to check out some of the more obvious man-made stimuli before rushing into print with another juicy UFO report. In fact, were such checks made with space experts on the above cases? Not to my knowledge....and I have been congenial and cooperative with other requests, particularly on recent cases in Chile and Argentina. Do ufologists really want to solve .UFO cases? It sure doesn't look that way. I'd expect such an approach from the National Enquirer. It's disappointing to see it from MUFON. JIM OBERG Dickinson, Texas Dear Editor, I think you're making an excellent job of the Journal — it's got a solid, purposive feel to it. Looking back over my files, it's encouraging to see the Journal steadily improving, year by year, from what originally was not a lot better than the newsletters of a dozen different UFO groups, to what is today one of the best of all the journals... With FSR in a very bad way, here in England we don't have anything to compare, though John Rimmer is embarking on a plan to raise Magonia's coverage to make at least some kind of replacement for FSR. Meanwhile, over in Belgium, Inforespace, once the most 'scientific' of the UFO journals, has had to lower its sights and go from a nicely printed to a tattily typewritten format; and while France's Lumieres dans la Nuit keeps doggedly going, Veillith is an old man now, and so are his collaborators, and one wonders if he's making any better provision for the future than Charles Bowen did? All very sad.... Yours'll soon be the only general UFO journal in existence! Hilary Evans London Dear Editor, No doubt, you wonder what kind of person subscribes to the MUFON UFO JOURNAL. Well, I am neither a skeptic nor a \"true believer\" on the subject of UFOs, but one who tries to be broad-minded on this subject. I have never seen a flying saucer, but I have seen strange lights in the sky which I could not explain. About ten years ago, I saw a red light (about the color of a stop light) that hovered in the air for several minutes, then plummetted to the ground. In the position where the light had been I noticed a dim glow, then all of a sudden, I saw a ball of flame which immediatey went out. I suspect that someone was playing a prank and that the red light was suspended from a hydrogen-filled balloon. When the flame reached the balloon, it flared up like the Hindenburg, but on a much smaller scale. More recently, I have seen similar lights in the sky, but the last one just flickered out. If it had taken off like a meteor, I would have suspected it to be a UFO. Incidentally, I am an amateur astronomer, so I do not think everything unusual in the sky to be a UFO. I have talked to people who claimed to have seen UFOs, but I act like a Missourian when I hear these stories. Yours truly, Leland A. Dolan Houston, Texas Dear Editor, The April 23, 1985 issue of the National Examiner, a dreadful supermarket tabloid, has an article which purports to quote me on the subject of UFO abductions. The background of this unfortunate article is as follows: A few weeks .ago I received a phone call from, I presume, the \"John Turner\" who assembled the article; I do not remember his name. He asked if I would cooperate with his paper on a UFO piece. I instantly declined, and he asked why. \"The context,\" I explained. I told him I fervently disapproved of this sort of tabloid. \"I understand perfectly,\" he answered, and went on to admit that his publication was sleazy, but that, more or less, \"a job is a job.\" I commiserated. He then went on to say that he had read my book Missing Time, and that he was, himself, interested in the subject of UFO abductions. Then, after saying that this was all \"off the record,\" I told him that I was looking into a number of new, strong cases. We chatted for a few minutes, and ended our conversation. Obviously I have been tricked and used, and I have myself to blame for being falsely trusting. When a friend told me about the article I was enraged, particularly so because something a little like this has happened to me before. I noticed that, at the least, the writer does not claim to have personally interviewed me. Much of the wildly garbled material it includes is garnered from Missing Time as well as various MUFON Journal pieces I have done, comments by Allen Hynek in IUR, and so forth - all \"public domain\" material - so I have virtually no recourse. I have learned a lesson. When any of us receives a phone call from any of these \"reporters\" - say no and hang up instantly! I deeply regret this incident, and apologize to my colleagues for any embarrassment it may have caused them.

Webb JUNE 1985 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Saturn, still retrograding westward in Libra, is now the lone planet in the evening sky until Jupiter rises. The yellow ringed world can be seen low in the SE at dusk some 18° to the upper right of the dimmer red star Antares. The nearly full moon is below the planet on June 1. Jupiter, brightening to magnitude -2.2 in Capricornus, rises in the east around 11:30 PM in midmonth and is the brightest planet in the sky until Venus rises. This largest world of the solar system commences moving westward on the 5th- an effect due to our faster-moving earth overtaking Saturn. (The illusion is similar to that created when one car passes another on the highway.) Bright Planets (Morning Sky): t Venus rises north of east just before 3 AM in midmonth. It reaches a point farthest west of the sun on the 12th. While this brilliant white planet shines in the east, Jupiter (five times fainter) dominates the southern sky. The crescent moon will lie in the vicinity of Venus from June 13 to 15; on the 14th the planet passes only 2° south of our satellite—a nice sight. The Soviet's Vega 1 and •2 spacecraft drop two landers on Venus on the 14th and 18th. Jupiter is low in the south at dawn. The moon appears below this giant world on the 7th. Saturn sets south of west about 3:30 AM in midmonth. o Moon Phases: Full moon-June 2 Last quarter-June 10 New moon-June 18 First quarter-June 25 The Stars: Heralding the approach of summer, the Summer Triangle of Vega, Deneb, and Altair greets the observer in the eastern sky. Even though blue-white Vega looks to the naked eye as if it is the brightest star of the season, actually orange- tinted Arcturus (in Bootes) located high in the SW outshines it by one-tenth magnitude. Red Antares (in Scorpius) moves low above the southern horizon, while Regulus (in Leo) nears the western horizon. Nearly overhead after twilight ends can be found a four-sided wedge of faint stars called the Keystone (in Hercules). Look for a tiny fuzzy \"star\" along the right side of the wedge—in reality the Great Hercules Cluster composed of thousands of stars in a vast globular cluster. Telescopes of increasing size resolve the patch into more and more stars. Be aware of a UFO culprit, the bright star of Capella, which skirts the northern horizon at this time of the year. 18 MESSAGE, Continued in his possession from the site and can obtain the plaster casts made of the imprints at the landing site.

IN OTHERS' WORDS -By Lucius Parish A summary of so-called \"monsters from outer space\" reports appears in the January 22 issue of NATIONAL- ENQUIRER. The cases, taken \"from Daniel Cohen's book, ENCYCLO- PEDIA OF MONSTERS, include the Flatwoods, WV creature of 1952, the Hopkinsville, KY \"little men\" of 1955 and others. UFOs and alleged appearances of the Virgin Mary are combined in the ENQUIRER'S March 19 issue. The phenomena have occured in the Spanish town of El Escorial since 1981, according to numerous reports. The controversy over an alleged crashed UFO in Puget Sound, Washington State, is explored in the January 29 issue of STAR. Dr. Bruce Maccabee and other UFO researchers have been investigating the reports since a circular glowing object was seen to enter the Sound on July 27, 1984. The February issue of OMNI devotes several pages to yet another interview with J. Allen Hynek. It has been truly said that if you've read one Hynek interview, you've read them all, so this can only be recommended for insomniacs. A very interesting UFO photo from Canada is discussed in the \"Anti-Matter/UFO Update\" section of March OMNI. This issue also contains an article on the alleged ancient constructions on the planet Mars, a subject of considerable interest to many UFO researchers. FATE's March issue has an article by Alvin H.

Please order these slide sets directly from Dan Wright, 1502 Marquette, Lansing, MI, 48906. These visual aids will provide valuable program material for our members when making public presentations. This project fulfills an essential need. * * * Since its inception in 1969, the Mutual UFO Network has never had an effective program for our budding Ufologists who are 17 years of age and under. Teenagers of that era have since been elevated to leadership roles as they matured and became the backbone of Ufology for today. However, what is even more important is the fact that these young men and women are our future ufologists in the continuing quest to resolve the UFO enigma. These young people have grown-up in the space-age with its sophisticated technology, therefore their minds are far more receptive to seeking answers to the mystery and challenge of the UFO phenomenon. Shirley Fox , a State Section Director in Florida, has already started working with young people in the Ft. Myers area. Ken Wisnefski, a young man in Asbury, N.J., has organized a group of his friends and named their team appropriately \"The Future UFO Investigators.\" With adult guidance, George Gregg, Jr. (age 15) has volunteered to handle MUFON headquarters correspondence with this emerging body of interested young people. In his first assignment, he has responded to questions posed by Ken Wisnefski. George will be working directly with the International Director in his new assignment and will thus have the facilities and services of the administrative office for support. Junior investigators may write to him at 201 Coventry, Seguin, TX 78155-4099 or to the MUFON office. We hope to present a detailed plan for the operation, titles, privileges, ID card identification, etc. for this new and important committee within MUFON at the 1985 Annual Corporate Meeting in St. Louis. In the meantime, we invite all members 17 years of age or under to write to George signifying their interests in establishing such a committee. * * * It has been brought to our attention that at least one person has been writing to government agencies under the Freedom of Informatio ACT (FOIA) demanding information and threatened lawsuits if the agency does not comply. We cannot and will not forbid anyone from making FOIA requests within the legal limitations of the law. However, we become very concerned when they identify themselves as a MUFON member, hoping to imply that they are speaking for and represent the Mutual UFO Network. Considering the large number of officers in MUFON, it is very difficult to specify who has the authority to write letters on behalf of MUFON. However, in order to preserve the fine reputation that we have earned, we will specify by organizational level who is authorized to write letters speaking on behalf of MUFON at the Annual Corporate Meeting. In the meantime, members should use discretion if they identify their capacity in MUFON by plainly stating that he/she is not an officer or spokesman for the organization, but is only writing in the capacity of a private citizen. We do not want to discourage anyone from utilizing the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) or writing to public governmental officials, even up to the President of the United States, if they are seeking UFO information or public support, provided that it is done in good taste and with proper respect to our elected officials in city, county, state or U.S. governmental bodies. * * * Volume I Number 2 of the Compufon Network Newsletter was published on April 15, 1985 and mailed to all current Compufon members by Michael D.

Since we received only one qualified nomination for this position as of April 15,1985, we would like to dispense with the cost of a mail ballot as prescribed in the MUFON Bylaws. Dan Wright, presently the State Director for Michigan, was the only candidate nominated. His name will be submitted to the members attending the Annual MUFON Corporate Meeting from the Central Region for their vote. We want to thank Charles Tucker for having served in this capacity after being elected in Dayton, Ohio in 1978. Ray Boeche, State Director for Nebraska, has been meeting with the U.S. Senator from Nebraska, the Honorable J. James Exon, to interest him in exploring the Rendlesham Forest Case further within the Senate Armed Forces Committee, of which he is a member along with Barry Gold water (Arizona) and the entire U.S. Senate. Each State Director is hereby authorized to write to each of your two U.S. Senators advising them of pertinent details by letter and including xerox copies of articles from the MUFON UFO JOURNAL where appropriate, soliciting their help in officially exposing this case to the American public.
