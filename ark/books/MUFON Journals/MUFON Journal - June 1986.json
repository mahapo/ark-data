By Cynthia Hind Cynthia Hind is MUFON's continental coordinator for Africa. She lives with her husband in Harare, Zimbabwe. I always feel that investigators like myself are so eager not to be taken for a ride by contactees in UFO cases that we are rather inclined to lean over backwards in favor of the incident being a hoax. During the years I have worked in Africa (about 15) I have had several extremely puzzling cases, ones which I have not been able to prove as hoaxes although I must say my intuition leads me to believe that they are not as genuine as the witness(es) want me to think. When I have presented them at Conferences or Workshops, the general consensus of opinion from MUFON hierachy has been to denigrate the case, despite the fact that they have not been involved with the witnesses. I have a case here in Zimbabwe which has made me think very seriously about how investigators sh'ould ' approach these rather 'way out' cases. It happened in July, 1975, while there was a spate of sightings in Zimbabwe, most of a circular light which appeared to move at will. Nothing was ever proven but I had reports from a BOAC pilot on his way from Johannesburg to London and two policmen who chased the light until it disappeared. UFO BURN? On the 28th July, I received a tip from a local journalist that a man in Macheke, about 140 km from Harare, had been burned by a UFO. On Saturday the 2nd August, together with four other interested persons, I set off by car for Macheke. The man involved was John Clark, aged 53, a slightly-built man who served as a clerk in the local Farmers Co-Operative Stores. What initially made me suspicious of him was that when I entered the Store and introduced myself as representing MUFON, an international UFO group, he said immediately, \"Oh, I didn't think it would go this far.\" His story was that he had been home all afternoon that Saturday as it was a cold and miserable winter's day. He had a roaring fire in the fireplace and at about 7:15 in the evening, he decided to go out across the road and buy some fish and chips for his supper. He stacked up the fire before he left so that it would burn for a while and went out, followed by his cat. Although he was married, his'wife was the live-in Matron at a girl's school in Marondera about 50 km away, and only came home every alternate weekend. When he got outside, it was dark, and he was immediately aware of a very bright light in the sky, just above the tree tops and telephone wires adjacent to his house. Even as he looked up, a brilliant beam of light shot out from the object and hit him, knocking him to the ground. He remembered hearing his cat shriek and it disappeared rapidly into the bush. He could not move; he was completely paralysed. He tried to move out of the beam of the light but he was stuck where he had fallen. He . remembered nothing else until he woke sometime later. The beam of light and the object had gone. He was sore and aching all over and could barely manage to get back to the house, where he crawled into bed. He did notice however, as he got into the house, that the fire was out and the fireplace quite cold. He lay in bed all next day (Sunday) and then on Monday morning, although too ill to go to work, he did report the matter to the police. He was badly bruised all down one side of his body. The papers had said he was 'burned' but when he took off his shirt to show me his chest, it looked more like bruising to me. Although Clark could not leave work to show me his home where all this had happened, he did give me permission to go to his house and look it over. First of all, we called at the police station to verify that Clark had indeed reported the matter. The policeman on duty was young and skeptical and remembered the report. \"If it had been anyone but John Clark, I might have believed him,\" he told me. \"He's a heavy drinker and after a few beers on the weekend, he could have seen anything,\" he laughed. We then visited the local inn, a typical small-village inn in my country where everyone knows everyone else and hears all the gossip. Several of us knew the landlord and he was most helpful. \"Clark bought a bottle of brandy and a 6-pack of beer on that day,\" he said. \"It's no secret for me to tell you that he is a heavy drinker, everyone around'here knows it.\" He also said, \"He's a bleeder too, you know.\" I thought to myself, well, that could explain the bruising under the skin. We then called at Clark's house, set fairly well back off the main road, and thickly hedged and tree-ed. On the fairly long driveway to the house, I noticed that a hard ridge had formed in the center of the road, with deep ruts on either side to' take the wheels of the car. The house was as Clark had described it. If he had come out of the back door, as he said, he would have an immediate view of the bright object above the trees and telephone wires. But we also speculated that if Clark was looking up at the light and had been drinking quite a bit, he could easily have tripped and fallen on the hard ridge in the center, thus accounting for the heavy bruising on the one side of his body. CASE CLOSED? (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"HOAX? Continued We looked for any burn marks among the bushes near where he had . fallen or any deterioration of the undergrowth, but there was nothing to note. There was some withering on the .hibiscus hedge, but that could have been effected by the frost which had occurred some days earlier. It was obvious to me that Clark could have imagined the whole thing. That was how 1 felt about it and my UFO investigators agreed with me. Unfortunately, 1 was so keen hot to be taken in by a hoaxer that I failed to follow through with this case. I should have had Clark hypnotized and been more insistent about a medical examination. I had suggested this, but he had refused, saying that he \"did not have much faith in doctors.\" Because of the policy' of most of the large UFO groups, I tend to lean towards negating a case when there is a single witness and the character of the person is 'in question. 1 also knew that MUFON and most Ufologists would have agreed with my belief of this wintess. 1 forgot — or almost forgot — about these incidents until November, 1985 when I was driving with some people to Nyanga, the mountainous districts of Zimbabwe. A' lady travelling with me told me that the owner of the Crocodile Motel in Rusape had had a UFO experience. 1 was under the impression that it had occurred recently, but when we stopped to interview her, I discovered that it had happened in 1975. \"If was a few days before the story of the man in Macheke appeared in the papers — it happened on a Saturday night!\" I realised immediately that it must have been on the same night that Clark had his alleged experience as his story had first appeared on the Tuesday or Wednesday, following the Saturday (29th/30th). The woman involved was June Barnes. At the time she was returning to the Motel with her partner, Tony Alexander. They were in Marondera at about 9 o'clock in the evening, when they stopped to buy cigarettes and a coke. When June got out of the car, she could smell a strange odor, almost like sewerage but not quite as bad as that. She mentioned it to Tony and he smelled it too. Then about five minutes later, just as they were passing Peterhouse, a large Boy's School, she saw a big orange light in the sky through the trees. It seemed to be egg-shaped, cut off at the top. At first she thought it was the moon. She said, \"Oh, I've never seen, a moon like that before.\" As they moved on the object rose higher and higher until it was above the trees. It seemed to be in the center of the road. At this stage she turned around and' there, out of the back window of the car, she could see the moon,.a white moon, whilst the other light was a lovely orange color. June thought to herself \"It can't be the sun, as the sun wouldn't be out at that time of night. Also, if it were the sun, I would not be able to look at it directly.\" Tony, who appeared to be • nervous, said, \"It isn't the sun, nor is it' the moon. It is something strange. Look at how it is moving.\" June thought it might be the movement of the car but she realised the light was now hovering. By this time they had reached Macheke (where, if you can believe Clark, he was lying in his garden, unconscious.) Macheke is a tiny village with the main road .from Harare to Mutare running through it. There are two garages there; one just before entering the village and the other opposite to Clark's house. His house is also on the main road but well back from it, with access from a rough track running parrallel to the main road. As June and Tony came to the first garage, June persuaded Tony to pull over and stop. The garage was lit up but there was no one there. It was during the War of Independence and garages ' were not manned at night. When they stopped, the object started coming closer. June noticed that this time it was quite round, like a ball, but still that warm, orange color. She was quite sure now that this was no reflection. The moon, which was clearly visible, was white. Tony had not turned the engine of the car off. He was clearly very nervous and his breathing was harsh and irregular. June knew he suffered from emphysema and asthma and she was worried about him. She kept on telling him to calm down. \"Whatever it is,\" she said, \"they are superior to us. If they had wanted to, they could have done away with us a long time ago.\" Tony shouted at her. \"Stop it, stop it, you're possessed by them....\" HEAT Suddenly he pressed his foot down on the accelerator and they shot forward, passing directly underneath the object. Tony immediately complained of the heat. June also felt hot, but she said, \"it .was like a hot-flush,\" and she ' thought it was caused by all the excitement. She had the window of the car open, trying to peer but and see the object as they moved. The light of the object surrounded the car and lit up the .surroundings. Now she again could smell the objectionable odor. She said it smelled like 'Durban-Bay' and. I am trying to obtain a chemical analysis of that smell from the Port Captain in Durban. Tony remained extremely agitated and in trying to calm him, June thought she would make a joke. \"Just think,\" she said, \"if they had come down to us we could have had them to tea at the Crocodile Motel. What marvellous publicity that would have been.\" But Tony was not amused. All he could think of was getting back to the Motel. June hoped the object might keep on following them. She wanted to stop, to get a better view of it and perhaps find other people to verify their sighting. She saw the lights of a house in Macheke — it could even have been the lights of John Clark's house — and she urged Tony to stop so that she could call some witnesses. But he refused and drove even faster. Shortly after they reached Headlands, about 20 minutes further on, the light suddenly shot off at a (continued on page 19)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"A CHILEAN OVERVIEW By J. Antonio Huneeus J. Antonio Huneeus is a Chilean-born freelance journalist presently living in New York and a MUFON Research Specialist. The goal of this report is to give an overall view of the state of ufology in Chile, the selection of a MUFON Representative there, and the prospects for MUFON to capitalize scientifically on Chile's vast public interest in UFOs. INTRODUCTION I left New York in early October of 1985 to visit Chile. My main goal was a personal one, namely, to celebrate with my family the 50th wedding anniversary of my parents. Besides this reunion and a needed vacation, I brought with me a selection of UFO slides with the aim of giving a lecture. My second UFO-related goal was to find a MUFON Representative in Chile. As it turned out, the public interest in UFOs was phenomenal and the lectures were a tremendous success. But beyond the great interest, I realized there is hardly any serious UFO organization in Chile and therefore, a great need to establish a network capable of scientifically investigating UFO cases. I took the initiative to launch a Chilean MUFON section because of this combination of widespread interest and lack of proper investigation. The idea was received with great enthusiasm. At the end of this report, I will explain the steps taken so far, as well as the prospects, research goals and required guidelines from the United States. MASSIVE SIGHTING It is not the purpose of this report to give data about UFO sightings in Chile since one of the main goals of the MUFON section will be precisely to South American press focuses on J. Antonio Huneeus compile a catalog of Chilean cases. No organization or individual has done this up to now. A brief discussion of the massive sightings of August 17, 1985, however, is necessary to understand the increasing social acceptance of the phenomenon. I have obtained a copy of a report from the General Administration of Civil Aeronautics published in the October issue of their official magazine, \"Informacion Aeronautica,\" which analyzed in depth this incident. The purpose here is to give only the incident's main facts, and to note the impact it had on the public's perception of UFOs. An estimated 2 million people in central Chile observed two UFOs for several hours beginning at 15:30 in the afternoon of August 17, 1985. The general area where the objects were observed included Santiago's metropolitan area, the central coastal area around the main port of Valparaiso, and various other resorts and locations in central Chile. Across the Andes in Argentina, the UFOs were also observed in the evening hours in Umkal, Mendoza and other sites near the border with Chile. The objects were described as distinct luminous spots which moved slowly and remained motionless at times. They were not similar to the so- called \"luminous clouds\" widely seen in the Southern Cone, which have been associated by James Oberg with Soviet space launches. (I generally agree with Oberg's solutions regarding South American cases and have assisted him in locating some reports, but it doesn't fit in this case.) The objects were seen by literally hundreds of thousands, were filmed with special equipment by the national TV station, Channel 7, and photographed by astronomers from the University of Chile's Cerro Calan Observatory in Sahtigo. They were also detected on the radar screens of Santiago-s Comodoro Benitez International Airport, as revealed in the Civil Aeronautics report. The Air Force's Weather Office (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"CHILEAN, Continued initially dismissed the UFOs as weather balloons but this hypothesis did not hold. There is a distinct possibility that only one of the objects could have been a French high-altitude research balloon launched from South Africa, but the second and more prominent object remains unidentified. I quote from the conclusions of the Civil Aeronautics report: \"Up fo the moment of finishing this report, the apparitions of that day still remain an enigma to be added to the 'archive of •unexplained phenomena.\" FRONTPAGES ,. As one can see from all this, the August 17 incident brought back the UFO controversy ,to the front page of the newspapers .everywhere in Chile. The interest in UFOs was reawakened dramatically since practically every Chilean; either 'saw the . objects personally or on TV, knew somebody who did or read about it in the papers. People are now hard to convince that UFOs are merely illusions or .hoaxes. Interesting, • another UFO was spotted in Santiago after midnight on January 6, 1986, while I was still in Chile. Because of the late hour, not too many people saw it, but. it was photographed by a reporter from the daily newspaper \"La Tercera.\" Since I .am a contributor to that paper, I was able to obtain prints of the photos. , The history of the UFO phenomenon in Chile presents similar characteristics to other countries. There are different types of cases, from IFOs like the luminous clouds caused by the deployment of Russian EW Cosmos satellites, to close encounters of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd kinds and even reported abductions; scramble incidents with jet fighters and radar cases, registered in various airports; photographs and films, etc. Like elsewhere, reports go back to the late 40s; flying saucers have appeared on and off in the media since at least the 50s; and there is the usual governmental silence and secrecy towards the issue with no recourse to procedures like the FOIA.

There are a few individuals who have pursued ufology and are listed in the following section. A large percentage of the people interested in the phenomenon, however, have tended to follow a mystical or religious interpretation of \"extraterrestrials\" along the lines of North American \"contactees.\" Although we are not talking of a large social following by any means, there are . several contactee groups operating right now in Chile. Some of the locally famous include the \"RAMA groups\" founded by the Peruvian contactee, Sixto Paz Wells; followers of the notorious Italian contactee, Eugenic Siragusa; and a spiritual community group in the valley of Elqui, headed by a Mother Cecilia, which follows the tradition of the so-called \"White Brotherhood\" and is allegedly in contact with the \"galactic fleet.\" These and other groups are portrayed in the TV documentary \"Extraterrestrial Cults\" produced by Channel 7, of which I have a copy. This background combining contactee groups with the growing popular interest in the phenomenon is important for us in order to understand the necessity of importing an investigative group like MUFON to Chile. CHILEAN UFOLOGISTS The following list does not attempt to be a complete one, sincere there are various individuals — some of them scientists — .who are .studying the phenomenon in Chile's northern and southern regions. I will try to cover the entire country in the future with a (continued next page) ."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"CHILEAN, Continued projected lecture tour. In any case, the list does include the main characters involved in the Santiago area. 1. PATRICIO VARELA is a professional broadcaster who has had a late night radio talk show devoted to UFOs for about 20 years. In Chilean terms, he can be compared to Frank Edwards or Long John Nebel in the U.S. His program \"La Hora Espacial\" (The Space Hour) is aired every Monday from 11:00 p.m. to midnight as part of his daily night talk show \"Saludando la Noche\" on Radio Portales, the country's largest and most popular AM station, reaching all of Chile and even parts of Argentina. Although Varela is more a popularizer than a field researcher, in the course of his 20-year program he has compiled extensive files and interviewed lots of UFO experts and witnesses. He has a wide following and considerable influence in the local UFO scene. I have appeared numerous times as a special guest on his program. He recorded the introduction to my lecture and announed it in his shows. (He couldn't deliver it live because of a time conflict with his radio show.) Varela is a key figure for any UFO-related project to be developed in Chile. 2. FERNANDO NOEL is an astronomer who works at the University of Chile's Cerro Calan Observatory in Santiago. He has been interested in the UFO field for several years from a more academic standpoint. He changed his attitude toward UFOs when he witnessed a UFO formation that he could not explain. Professor Noel authored the chapter on UFOs in the book, \"ARCA - Intelligent Life in the Universe,\" published by the University of Chile's Faculty of Astronomy. Fernando Noel is a member of Professor Sturrock's Society for Scientific Exploration. He has also assisted James Oberg's research on the Plesetsk IFO affair. 3. HUGO CORREA is a well known science fiction writer and newspaper columnist who has written regularly about UFOs over the years. At one point he headed UFO Chile, a now-defunct small research group. On the other hand, he has very good UFO OVER SANTIAGO 1/6/88 0:30 a.m. Photographs by Jaime Baa cur of 'La Tercara* connections with the government since he works with one of the daughters of President Pinochet in a cultural foundation called Fundacion Chile. In his widely read weekly column \"Cronicas Terrestres\" in the newspaper \"La Tercera,\" Correa discusses UFO cases from time to time. A similar role is played by another writer and journalist, ANDRES ROJAS MURPHY, the President of the Science Fiction Club of Chile. Significantly, Rojas Murphy is currently doing an ongoing series on UFOs for the magazine \"Pillan,\" an official youth publication of the Chilean Air Force (FACH).    • 4. CIO is the Centro de Investigaciones OVNI or Center for UFO Investigations headed by HUGO PACHECO. Ostensibly, CIO is the only investigative group in Chile patterned along foreign UFO organizations. It has been in operation for 4 or 5 years, and has probably anywhere between 25 and 50 members. Although I have good relations with Mr. Pacheco, who assisted me on my previous trip to Chile in 1984,1 found on this visit that CIO is now somewhat discredited because of the religious indertone that Pacheco has given it. This caused the defection of its more scientific-minded members, who formed the splinter group ORION. As it could be expected, CIO does have good-files on Chilean cases, but its current methodology and level of operations is a far cry from the standards required by MUFON or CUFOS. They have no regular publication. 5. ORION is a small investigative group headed by LUIS RIQUELME and AQUILES CASTILLO, who were once in charge of CIO's Technical Commission. Because of disagree- ments with the way Hugo Pacheco was leading the organization, Riquelme and Castillo decided to form their own group over a year ago. Although not a formal organization with membership or legal status, ORION is the closest thing in Chile to a scientific UFO investigative team as we know them in the United States. Besides their field experience of several years, ORION's main asset is a quiet network of a few scientific consultants who are interested in the phenomenon. Another plus is an ATARI computer which Requelme has recently installed in his home to begin computerizing ORION's UFO files. I had several meetings with Riquelme, Castillo and other members from ORION. They expressed full support to the idea of establishing a MUFON (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"CHILEAN, Continued branch in Chile, offering 'their cooperation, contacts and even the possibility of merging ORION with MUFON. 6. CIVIL AERONAUTICS is the government agency in charge of civil aviation, officially known as the Direccion General de Aeronautica Civil. As it can be gleaned from copies of their official magazine, \"Informacion Aeronautica,\" the agency has a keen interest in the UFO phenomenon. Two articles. published in this magazine in 1985 and 1984'givea.list of several sightings that were registered in the logs of various Chilean airports between 1972 and 1985, The articles conclude with the following instruction: \"Report your experience to the ,Air Traffic Service Department of the Direction of Aerial Navigation Services. They are interested in a detailed description of the phenomenon, the text entered in the Log Book, the weather report, a cassette of all communications involved, clippings of press reports, statements of other visual witnesses, etc....Thanks.\" The Public Relations Department of Civil Aeronautics was invited to my UFQ lecture, and they sent a representative who recorded it, gave me copies of their magazines and expressed interest in cooperating with MUFON. MILITARY 7. ARMED FORCES. Like most countries, the Armed Forces of Chile, composed of the Army, Navy, Air Force and National Police, have their secret history regarding UFOs. Military personnel were involved in some of Chile's most famous cases, such as the abduction of corporal Armando Valdes in Pampa Lluscuma, Arica, in 1977, and the scrambling of F-5E fighter jets from the Cerro Morena Air Force Base in Antofagasta in 1978 and 1979. These cases were released but many others have not been. There are fumors that the services have in their possession moviefilms and other kinds of UFO evidence. Since Chile is presently under military rule with no recourse to things 8 like the FOIA, it is entirely up to the military to cover-up or publicize a UFO case according to its needs. We know, that officers of the Air Force, Army and Navy attended my UFO lectures. Other than an invitation to the- Air Force's P.R. Office, no formal contact was established with the Armed Services at this time. Those contacts could be established but it would take considerable time and ; care. 8. JORGE ANFRUNS is the new MUFON Representative in Chile. I met Mr. Anfruns when I was looking for a manager to produce my lectures.- He accepted and the lectures were a total success. Jorge Anfruns has a background in Public Relations, has followed independently the .UFO phenomenon for some 20 years, and is currently the publisher of \"Pensar,\" a recently released'science and cultural monthly magazine. When I mentioned to him that I was looking for a MUFON Representative in Chile, he volunteered immediately. In the following weeks, I was able to observe first-hand his performance and contacts as we put together my \"Historial OVNI\" lecture and slide show. The .success of this event with the ensuing prospects of creating a MUFON branch in Chile are detailed in the following sections. UFO/LECTURES My UFO lecture and slide show has been given on numerous occasions, including two SBI Symposiums in Albany and New York City in 1983 and 1984, the FAECE (Argentinian UFO Federation) International Congress in Santa Fe,, Argentina in 1983, a Symposium organized by Irene Granchi in Rio de Janeiro in 1984, the NUFOC Conference in Cleveland in 1984, and various engagements in Detroit, Santiago, New York City, Vermont and Houston. During my previous trip to Chile in 1984, I gave two .lectures — one sponsored by CIO in Santiago's National Press Building. The lectures were a first step without much transcendence at the time; the halls were small and there was no publicity. However, the 1984 trip was useful because of the contacts made with key people in the field, such as Patricio Varela, Fernando Noel and Hugo Pacheco, as well as media outlets like the daily newspaper \"La Tercera\" and the radio station Portales, both of which are the largest of their kind in Chile. Naturally, all these elements contributed greatly, to the lectures' impact on this occasion. My original idea was to give one lecture for an audience of 200 or 300 people. As it turned out, this goal was surpassed when almost 500 people attended the first lecture at the Hotel Galerias Nacionales in downtown Santiago on the evening of November 29, 1985. With a waiting list of 200, a second lecture was given in the same hall on December 10 — 300 people attended. Of course, none of this would have .been possible without the assistance of Jorge Anfruns and the team of dedicated people, who produced the shows. MEDIA COVERAGE Undoubtedly, exposure to the media was a key element for the public appeal the lectures had. My .first move was to contact Patricio Varela shortly after, my arrival in October. I had already appeared several times on Varela's \"Space Hour\", during 1984, and I had maintained some correspondence with him since then. I was immediately invited to this show to talk about any new ufological developments in the U.S. or elsewhere. In the course of this and seven other programs, I discussed a number of events, including a whole show on the \"ghost estimate of the situation\" Air Intelligence Report No. .100-203-79, the Bentwaters incident, the Westchester flap, the luminous clouds from Plesetsk, crashed saucers and Len Stringfield, the Billy Meier hoax, American UFO orgnaizations with emphasis on MUFON, Brazilian cases, etc. The radio show was also used to announce and publicize the lectures, as well as receiving later feedback from the radio audience, who could either phone the program or send letters which Varela reads the following week. The other strategy was to send a press release to various newspapers, (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"CHILEAN, Continued other radio stations and television channels. \"La Tercera de La Hora\" published the full text of the press release on November 27 under the headline, \"Chilean Investigator Will Reveal Secret UFO Documents.\" \"La Tercera\" also published a short announcement on December 9 that the lecture would be repeated. Other newspapers published reviews of the event. The popular tabloid \"La Cuarta\" published a lighter and somewhat sensationalized account under the headline, \"UFO Boss Leaves Us Jumpy With Space Tales,\" On December 1 \"Las Ultimas Noticias\" gave a more sober review, \"Chilean Investigator Reveals UFO Secrets,\" on December 2. The University of Chile's Channel 11 was the only television network to carry the event; first as a regular item on the evening news, and later in an interview for the program \"Extra, Mujeres, Extra,\" a news magazine produced by women. The most thorough story was published on December 10 by the newspaper \"La Segunda\" as a long interview under the headline, \"Chilean Investigator in the United States: UFOs Exist'.\" This is not entirely surprising since I was a regular contributor for \"La Segunda\" between 1974 and 1977, publishing numerous articles about science, the environment, space, and even some of my first UFO stories. Other radio stations commented upon the lectures and I was interviewed by the monthly magazine \"La Bicicleta.\" The ' story will appear sometime in February or March. Finally, I am also expecting a copy of \"Buen Domingo,\" the Sunday Magazine of \"La Tercera,\" with an article I wrote about crashed saucers. I was told by its editor, Ines Maria Cardone, that UFOs are a subject that always interest their readership. MUFON ACTIVITIES Given the degree of interest that Jorge Anfruns and his team showed for MUFON, we decided to include the organization in the program of the \"Historial OVNI\" lecture. This was not a whimsical initiative but a well thought out one, due to the large public interest in the subject and the lack of serious groups capable of providing some answers without a mystical slant. As a Research Specialist for MUFON, I. found that this was the right thing to do, since this was one of my prime goals on this trip. MUFON's name was used on the podium, as you can see in the photographs, and also in the poster and press release which describe .me as its representative. Furthermore, a brief description of MUFON was included in the program sheet of \"Historial OVNI.\" Information on how to become, a member and MUFON's address were also included. I don't expect, however, that you will get too many members from this announcement for economic and linguistic reasons. In Chile's depressed and debt-ridden economy, $16 (3,200 pesos) is too high for the average citizen. They will also have difficulty fully understanding English in the MUFON UFO JOURNAL. Enclosed with the program sheet, we distributed a form requesting people's name, phone and address, work, education, and a brief statement of any UFO sighting they had had in the past, or why they were interested in the phenomenon. Altogether, 80 forms were completed and returned to the front desk. Mr. Anfruris will send me a detailed breakdown of the list, but roughly speaking, a fourth had degrees or some technical training. As MUFON's Representative, Jorge Anfruns will stay in contact with these and other people to form a local MUFON network in Chile. Luis Riquelme and Aquiles Castillo of ORION expressed their full support and cooperation with the idea, adding that they would even dissolve their group if MUFON should take a definite shape. The ORION people are necessary because they are one of the few in Chile to have actual experience as UFO field investigators; and secondly, because they have a few scientific consultants from the University of Concepcion, the University of Chile, and other well- qualified institutions. I realize that this is perhaps a somewhat unusual situation regarding MUFON and representatives in foreign countries. Nevertheless, there is a precedent that is useful to point out, that of CIU-CUFOS Buenos Aires, The Commission of Ufological Investiga- tions, basically composed of Guillermo Roncoroni, Alejandro Agostinelli and Alejandro Chionetti, is also the CUFOS Representative in Argentina. Besides their own magazine, \"UFO Press\" (considered one of the best of its kind in Latin America), CIU- CUFOS Buenos Aires also publishes a Spanish edition of the International UFO Reporter. This possibility can be considered with the MUFON/ORION group in Chile, top. Jorge Anfruns is already involved in the publishing business with his magazine \"Pensar,\" and he expressed the willingness to do a MUFON publication in Spanish with MUFON's approval. RESEARCH GOALS 1. The immediate goal is to form a core group to consolidate the interest generated by the lectures, the poll and meetings between ORION, Anfruns and myself. I am presently expecting Mr. Anfruns' first report and. he is also expecting from me guidelines from the U.S. As a first step, I will send a copy of the MUFON Field . Investigators Manual to Chile, where they can start digesting it and eventually translating parts of it into Spanish. 2. To establish a network of investigators and consultants, not only in Santiago, but throughout the country. UFOs are a widespread phenomenon in Chile from Arica to Punta Arenas. In fact, some regions like the northern Atacama desert, are more prone to UFO sightings than the central region around Santiago. One of my plans for the future is to conduct a lecture tour throughout Chile's main cities, where numerous new contacts can be established and integrated into the MUFON network. 3. To compose a standard UFO questionnaire for field investigators based on the current one from MUFON. 4. To train new investigators within MUFON standards.

In Poltergeist he brought us the story of a sweet little girl with a very strange TV. If you saw the movie, you may remember the famous teleportatioh scene. It caught the eye of the science-fiction author, and math professor, Dr. Rudy Rucker, who mentioned it in his book, The . 4th Dimension: Toward A Geometery of Higher Reality, (Houghton Mifflin Co., Inc. Boston, 1984). He described it like this: \"Most modern ghost tales do not bring in the fourth dimension. An interesting exception . is Steven Spielberg's movie Poltergeist. The 4-D aspect of this movie arises when balls that are thrown into the closet of one room appear from the ceiling of another room....indicating a route through the fourth dimension!\" Dr. Rucker illustrates his 4-D explanation with a cartoon by the artist David Povilaitis. The cartoon shows a series of balls passing out of one room of a two-dimensional \"flatland\" house, moving into a higher dimension, and then falling back into another room of the house. To a two-dimensional flatlander, this whole process would seem eerie and incomprehensible. However, from the perspective of a higher dimension, it becomes obvious that a higher space allows a freedom of movement that would be undreamed of by those trapped in a lower space. WHAT IS TELEPORTATION? When an object seems to vanish from one location, only to appear at another location, the object is said to have been \"teleported.\" The term teleportation was coined by the writer Charles Fort more than 50 years ago. He documented a large'number of 10 cases where people, animals, or objects seemed to appear or disappear. Fort's major books have been combined and published as The Complete Books of Charles Fort, (Dover Publications, Inc., New York, 1974). The importance of teleportation for ufology was recognized in 1963 by the technical writer, Luis Schoenherr, in a series of articles that he wrote for the Flying Saucer Review. He used the term \"dematerialize\" for teleportation, and he argued as follows: \"There is even some evidence that UFOs are able to dematerialize other objects...In my opinion this could only be the result of shifting the objects into another dimension inaccessible to us.\" This 1963 article was recently reprinted by FSR in their October 1985 issue (Volume 31, No. 1), under the title, \"UFOs And The Fourth Dimension: A Re-Examination.\" The article gives an overview of UFO/ hyperspace ideas. In a letter to this author (Eden), dated, 20 November 1985, Luis Schoenherr admitted that more than two decades later, he still finds the. higher space approach to be, \"one of the most reasonable.\" INDIVIDUAL CASES The book by Raymond Fowler entitled The Andreasson Affair (Prentice-Hall, Inc., New Jersey, 1979) involves both human and humanoid teleportations allegedly witnessed by Mrs. Betty Andreasson (Luca) in 1967. She described how some humanoids teleported into her home, through a closed door. Oddly, the humanoids seemed to move along by forming a series of multiple images; a little like a rolling ball being photographed by use of a stroboscopic light. A possibly related effect has been discovered in some UFO photographs which seem to show a series of multiple- UFO-images. For instance,' see the UFO photos shown in Adrian Vance's book, UFO's, The Eye and The Camera, (Barlenmir House Publishers, New York, 1977). In his book Vance speculates that the multiple images may be due to certain interdimensional effects, or perhaps to some form of time-related anomaly. Another case of teleporting humanoids, very similar to the Andreasson case, was described by Brinsley Le Le Poer Trench (Lord Clancarty) in his book, Operation Earfh (Neville Spearman Ltd., Great Britain, 1969). It is alleged that, in 1957, one Mrs. Cynthia Appleton was repeatedly visited by some humanoids who popped into her home, \"like a TV picture on the screen, a blurred image and then suddenly everything is clear.\" During this apparent teleportation process, the witness noticed that there was an odd whistling sound which reminded her of the sound that \"the old wireless sets used to make when tuning in to a station.\" Another odd feature was that a newspaper on the floor was trampled by an intruding humanoid and the paper was mysteriously burned by his feet. Perhaps the moral here is, if you are going to teleport — wear thick shoes and carry a fire extinguisher? MEN-IN-BLACK A bizarre case that comes to us from the dark side of the twilight zone is reported in Dr. Berthold Schwarz's two-volume work, UFO Dynamics, (Rainbow Books/Betty Wright, Florida, 1983). He details the story of a medical doctor, Herbert Hopkins, whose brief stint as a ufologist was interrupted by one of the legendary Men-in-Black (MIB). A completely hairless MIB, sporting red lipstick and a black derby, allegedly directed some threats to the doctor. Next, the strange fellow (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Figure 3. Betty's rendition of how the entities appeared through the closed kitchen door: they \"moved in a jerky motion, leaving a vapory image behind\" (drawn April 10, 1977) TELEPORTATION, Continued casually teleported a penny from Dr. Hopkins' outstretched hand. Dr. Schwarz quotes the doctor as saying: \"He (the MIB) told me to keep looking at the coin; as I did so the coin slowly became light blue in color, and then it began to become blurred to my vision. My hand was in sharp focus, but try as I might I could not seem to focus on the silver-blue penny. It became more blurred, became round like a little blue fuzzy ball, and then became vaporous and gradually faded away.\" The dour Man-in-Black myster- iously informed the doctor that, \"Neither you nor anyone else on this plane (not planet) will ever see that coin again.\" After a few more absurd threats, the strange fellow staggered away, leaving the doctor in a state of high anxiety. Well, such is the stuff of legends and of the twilight zone of ufology. Many ufologists today will not study a MIB case because they know from past experience that these cases are often hoaxes. However, Dr. Schwarz may have a point when he asks us to examine all of the odd reports that surround ufology. By skeptically examining such reports we may be able to determine whether they are only folklore, calculated mischief, or true cases of anomaly. URI GELLER Perhaps the strangest UFO- oriented book is Andrija Puharich's, Uri:' A Journal of the Mysfery of Uri Geller, (Anchor Press/Doubleday & Co., Inc., New York, 1974). Dr. Puharich reported that objects would appear and disappear around the Israeli psychic, Uri Geller, on an almost daily basis. UFOs were sighted, and even contacted, via mysterious and torturous means. Whether hoax, or reality, or something in-between, this must be one of the oddest and most complex cases on record: In a.follow-up book, Uri Getter: My Story, (Praeger Publishers, Inc., New York, 1975) by Uri Geller, (or ghosted by John Fuller, according to Martin Gardner) the psychic claimed that he was teleported bodily from the East Side of Manhattan toOssining, N.Y., or a distance of more than thirty miles. As a result of these books, and because of Geller's growing fame, several of the more irate \"debunkers,\" began firing continuous salvos of ridicule at Geller, Puharich, and all those who would seek to study Geller scientifically. Parapsychologists, and others who were interested in Geller- type phenomena, soon retreated from the heavy shelling of continuous ridicule. Was the Geller controversy the result of ingenious tricks, strange paranormal truths, or some subtle mixture of tricks.and truth? The only certainty is that ridicule overruled rationality. Here I have touched upon only a few of the highly intricate and emotionally supercharged UFO/CE-III teleportation cases. However, there are many more. The various humanoid catalogues contain scores of bizarre cases that I haven't mentioned, and the CE-III literature is a goldmine of data. Buried in this avalance of. oddities are the clues that will someday give our great-grandchildren the secrets of this strange world that we live in. Ufologists who care to search other literature for teleportation phenomena will find forteans, parapsycholgists, historians, and many others have amassed a huge quantity of data that supports the general notion of teleportation. The parapsychologist, Dr. Nandor Fodor, once filled' an entire book with teleportation cases. His impressive workd, Mind Over Space (The Citadel Press, New York, 1962), is an unrivaled classic in this obscure area of research. Unfortunately, the late Dr. Fodor did not cover any of the modern UFO/humanoid cases that seem so prevalent today. Some of Dr. Fodor's cases have been reprinted in Leslie Shepard's two-volume work, Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology, (Gale Research Company, Michigan, 1979). Mr. Shepard relates relevant cases under several different categories, including: \"Apports,\" \"Asports,\" \"Teleportation,\" and even \"Ectoplasm.\" But if many teleportation cases are pure fantasy, then others would seem to straddle the fence somewhere between fantasy and fact. A good example of this would be William L. Moore and Charles Berlitz's The Philadephia Experiment (Fawcett Crest Books, New York, 1979). The book has since been adapted to a fictional adventure movie. (continued next page) 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"TELEPORTATION, Continued The legend has it that in 1943, the U.S. Navy tried, to shield a ship from either magnetic mines, -or possibly radar waves; but ended up teleporting the ship and losing some crewmen. In a privately published paper in 1984, William • Moore updated his . research on this case. His conclusion was that most of the story w.as probably only folklore, but 'that the Navy did attempt some kind of experiment that injured or killed .'some of the • crew member's,'on'.a ship. Embarassment, then, rather than anomaly may explain .most of the legend. FORTEANA Another source of teleportation reports is, of course, the fortean journals. Each of these journals carries \"fortean data\" which includes material similar to that studied by Charles Fort in his early (1919-1930's) books on anomalies. According to the leading fortean, Robert J.M. Richard, the three primary fortean journals are: Fortean Times (which he founded),, INFO (International Fortean Organization), and Pursuit (Journal of the Society .for the Investigation of the .Unexplained). These journals also publish much UFO- related material: (Charles Fort was one of the first to recognize the potential significance of strange things in the sky. He even suggested that aliens might teleport to earth to \"be degraded.\"). Borrowing largely from the fortean journals, the author Francis Hitching lists a number of human and animal teleportation cases in his interesting work,The Mysterious World: An Atlas of the Unexplained (Holt, Rinehart and Winston, New York, 1978). He includes maps that give an overview of the world-wide distribution of teleportation events. These maps can also give you some idea, of the great distances sometimes claimed to be involved.. R.J.M. Richard has written some classic fortean books (coauthored with John Michell) that describe a number of peculiar teleportation cases; see their two works: Phenomena: A Book of Wonders (Thames and Hudson Ltd., London, 1977) and Living Wonders 12 (Thames and Hudson Ltd.,- London, 1982). These books' are visual masterpieces and they are sometimes considered: two,, of the greatest \"fortean\" books written, since the death of Fort, himself. The fortean writers, Jerome Clark (editor of Internationa} UFO Reporter), and Loren Coleman coauthored The Unidentified-(Warner Books, Inc., New York, 1975), and Creatures From.'TTie Outer Edge (Warner Books, Inc., New. York, '1978).-. Their material '.includes animal, human; and \"monster\" teleportatiqns.- Coleman,'s .recent; Mysterious America (Faber and Faber, Inc., Massachusetts, 1983), contains.a section entitled, \"Teleporting Animals\" that complements similar writings by Michell and Rickard, and by the earlier Charles Fort. POLTERGEIST CASES In his Presidential Address given before the Twelfth Annual Convention of the Parapsychological Association, in 1969, Professor Hans Bender described a number of teleportation cases uncovered during his poltergeist, research in Germany. His lecture was published in the Proceedings of the Parapsychological Association, No. 6, 1969.(Ed. by W:G: Roll, R.L, Morris, and J.D. Morris, North Carolina, 1971). According to Bender, \"Four of.our cases were highly suggestive of the phenomena involving an irregular trajectory, indication of penetration of matter through matter; and t .the sensation of warmth associated, with tele : .apported objects, as well as the apparent formation \"in the air.\" Bender claimed that tools .fell out of a locked toolbox, clothes fell mysteriously from a ceiling, nails rained iri showers,, etc. He wrote ..that witnesses saw objects that, \"rushed out of the wall,\" and \"when picked up, the objects gave a sensation of being warm.\" Dr. Bender was led to speculate: \"Perhaps the hypothesis of a higher space, or a fourth dimension, should be considered.\" And, echoing a comment previously made by A.R.G. Owen, he observed, \"Clearly, no room is closed if an object can take a trajectory in higher space. It will, in addition, appear or disappear instantaneously.\" ; One of the. major classics of poltergeist research is A.R.G. Owen's book entitled, Can 'We Explain'The .Poltergeist?' (Helix Press/Garrett Publications; New York, 1964.) In a 32- page chapter entitled \"Apportation and Teleportation,\" Owen : described several poltergeist/teleportation cases and their possible implications of higher space: He wrote as follows: , '\"It remains, therefore, a' 1 purely open question whether or not there is an actual space of higher dimension not usually' accessible to matter or energy, but which\" physical objects could in principle get into. If so there is presumably some force which holds the physical continuum together and stops things from leaking away into other compartments of higher space.\" This postulated force is sometimes referred to as'a \"dimensional barrier,\" because such a force would act as a barrier that actively prevents objects, like ourselves, from drifting in the direction of a higher space. Somewhat similarly, our Earth's 'own gravity acts as a kind of \"barrier\" to prevent us from going to the moon (unless we use space shuttles and lots of expensive energy!). Just as gravity holds us qnto.the surface of the earth, so a dimensional barrier would hold us within the \"hyper- surface\" of our normal three- dimensional world. The concept of a dimensional barrier may prove to be a very powerful tool in helping us to understand the nature of our world. OUT-OF-BODY Hilary Evans, writing in the May/June 1979 issue of Flying Saucer ' Review (Volume 25, No. 3) suggested that out-of-the-body experiences (OBEs) such as those studied by parapsychblogists, might have implications for ufology. His article was entitled, \"Signpost to a Parallel Universe?\" He discussed the OBE experiences of the famous psychic, Robert A. Monroe. Mr. Evans wrote as follows: \"Monroe's explorations seem to have brought him to a world which could — just could — be the place from (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"TELEPORTATION, Continued which our UFOs come; or, if not that place, then it could indicate the kind of place we should be looking for.\" Followers of Monroe's adventures may be interested to know that this apparently multi-dimensional explorer has also reported some possible .teleportation effects. In his recent book, Far Journeys (Doubleday&Co., Inc., New York, 1985), Mr. Monroe reports that money- sometimes mysteriously appears in clothes placed in one closet in his home. He modestly admits that, \"very few people really believe it, and I don't blame them.\" He adds, \"I wouldn't if it didn't happen to me.\" Ironically, Charles Fort commented on the possibility that psychics might be able to teleport money.. He wrote: \"I have collected notes upon 'mysterious robberies,' wondering whether a teleportative power has ever been used criminally. As to apports, if a medium could transport sea shells from the sea to his cabinet, he could abstract funds from a bank to his pocket.\" HUMAN TRANSLUCENCY One of the strangest byproducts of Monroe's OBEs is that his body sometimes seems to become partially translucent. This,reminds one of these reports, where UFOs, or-even humanoids, are said to be translucent, or transparent like cloudy quartz crystals. Two highly credible witnesses to Monroe's ' translucency' .were the medical reser'achers, Dr. Stuart W. Twemlow and Dr. Fowler Jones. According to a report in Far. Journeys, Monroe was being monitored with EEG equipment, in an OBE experiment, when suddenly, two of the researchers saw his body go visually out of focus. Dr. Twemlow and a colleague described it as follows: \"He was observed by us through a one-way window.... Simultaneously, Dr. Jones and SWT (Dr. Twemlow) turned to each other and reported the impression of a heat wavelike distortion beginning at Monroe's waist, so that it was difficult to\" get a clearly focused picture of his upper body, although his lower body was in clear focus.\" . Oddly, a similar translucency of the human body is sometimes reported in connection; with human teleportation cases. See, for example, the Dr. Z case, among others, reported in Dr. Fodor's, Mind Ouer Space. • If Hilary Evans is. correct in his suggestion that the OBE phenomenon is of .fundamental importance to ufology, then Robert A. Monroe's experiences are clearly a wonderful place to begin searching for useful clues. CONCLUSION There are several hundred reports of teleportation buried in the ufological, parapsychological, and fortean literatures. Some of his material seems understandable when viewed in terms of a higher dimensional perspective. If even one case of teleportation is real, then we are holding the keys to a massive, intellectually-locked, door. Dare we unlock the door, or like frightened children, will we only hide the keys under our beds? As Huck Finn might have admonished Tom Sawyer, I double dast dare you! REFERENCES .Dr. Martin H. Sable was able to cite 53 references to UFO-related teleportations in his bibliographic work, Exobiology: A Research Guide (Green Oak Press; Michigan, 1978). Writing the foreword to Sable's book, Dr. J. Allen Hynek sagely informed the readers that, \"these new empirical observations and phenomena no longer can be summarily dismissed.\" .Another bibliographic guide that covers teleportation accounts, is George Eberhart's massive reference, A Geo-Bibliography of Anomalies (Greenwood Press, Connecticut, 1980).

I have known Betty Hill and been involved with sporadic research with her since around 1976, and I believe what may be happening in association . with her now may, anthropologically, at least, be as interesting as the original abduction report. In parapsychological research . there is what is known as the (Kenneth) Batcheldor Effect, based on extensive research of the past 25 years. .Psychodynamically speaking, it seems to involve these steps in the production of psychokinetic or PK (and, probably, visual) .effects: (1) fraudulent or \"pseudo\" (accidental) production of PK, as through mistaken observation, (2) psycholgoical dissociation (as in sleep-walking or hypnosis) of persons relative to the fraudulent PK, and, then, (3) occurrence of genuine PK which has a physical reality which is tangible to cameras and all present. For details, the reader is referred to the several articles by Patric Giesler, in J. Amer. Soc. Psychical Resch. and Parapsychology Review, 1984-85. Many UFOlogists will object that it is misleading to use \"psi\" (ESP and PK) to explain bizarre effects of some UFO cases. Anthropologists will object that the anthroplogy of psi is still in its relative infancy (mainly since 1974). But the application of Batcheldor's theories to some known cases in the social sciences seems to provide an exact fit (e.g., Giesler's and Sidney Greenfield's work in Brazil and mine and J.J. Williams' in Jamaica). As my discussion of one UFO case noted (CUFOS Assoc. Newsletter 4(2):5-8, 1983), whatever Mrs. Hill has seen in recent years, it seems evident that there have been some genuine sightings and in fact CE-III's in 14 association with Betty Hill's \"UFO. watching parties\" in Kingston, NH. The proper elements are there: an imaginative person who sights the Pease Air Force Base aerial \"garbage,\" thinking some of it is UFOs. and a reasonably gullible audience ripe for psychological dissociation and \"creation,\" if you will, of a genuine UFO, with physical characteristics for all to observe (or catch on radar, photographs, etc.). (Inter alia, this kind of \"creationist\" explanation is not at all to suggest that UFOs are not real or even that they are not extraterrestrial; the simplicity of my brief explanation here is misleading in that respect.) In sum, I believe that there are genuine UFOs in the Kingston area, and that Mrs. Hill may well be the \"trigger\" for their \"appearance\" (seeability?). That assumption is as unprovable as its opposite, but when sociological realities have a patterned and verifiable (e.g., photographic) aspect, it is probably significant at a .level deeper than that of mere \"beliefs and traditions\" (i.e., cultural patterns). Joseph K. Long Professor of-Anthropology Plymouth State College Plymouth, NH YEAR-END REPORT Over the past year, the Fund for UFO Research has sponsored investigation/research projects on the UFO crash/retrieval issue and UFO \"abduction\" reports, as well as historical research and other topics. The final report on the psychological study of \"UFO \"abductees,\" by Dr. Aphrodite Clamar, Budd Hopkins and Ted Bloecher was released in 1985, and copies were -sent to major psychology societies. The study had one major finding: that after study by well-qualified professional psychologists, UFO \"abductees\" are essentially normal people who display the symptoms of victims, not \"crackpots.\" A major catalogue of UFO abduction cases, with analysis of . recurring patterns and significant features, has .been compiled by Dr. Edward Bullard. This massive document will 'be 'released by the FUND in 1986, along with- a complementary study by Michael Frizzell conducted independently. Together, these two reports will become sourcebooks and will provide guidance for all future studies of abduction case reports. They will provide an overview of the nature and scope of the UFO abduction question, which should stimulate further research. A major study of the 1896-97 \"mystery airship\" reports in the U.S., by Robert G. Neeley, Jr., is in an advanced stage and is expected to be released in 1986. Research support by the FUND enabled Mr. Neeley to travel extensively throughout the-U.S. to visit major libraries and depository sites and to obtain a large amount of new information, despite' the face that several other people already 'have conducted fairly comprehensive research of this topic. The resulting catalogue and analysis should be the most definitive study yet conducted of what might be called the first wave of UFO sightings in the U.S. If, in fact, there is a conventional explanation for the reports, the information compiled by Mr. Neeley will be'an important factor in resolving this question. In parallel with the U.S. study, the FUND recently approved a grant to a team of British investigators to compile and analyze data on \"mystery aircaft\" reports in the British Isles early in the 20th Century. This study will get under way in 1986. Another project funded over the past two years and expected to result in a final report during 1986 is an update (considerably expanded) of the study by V.J. Ballester-Olmos of Iberian"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Peninsula (Spain and Portugal) UFO cases involving physical effects-- otherwise known as Close Encounters of the Second Kind. The original catalogue of Iberian Peninsula CE-II cases was published by the Center of UFO Studies in 1976. Again, the expanded data collection and analysis is expected to provide a clearer picture of the nature and scope of CE-II cases worldwide. A long-time goal of the FUND has been to encourage UFO research projects in the college/university community,, to provide funding for graduate and post-doctoral level studies. Colleges and universities potentially are a major contributor t'o UFO research. A 'proposal from a graduate student at • astronomy currently is being evaluated by the National Board, -and thus it is premature to discuss it more fully at this time. The FUND, over the past few years, also has received inquiries or proposals from documentary film makers and others regarding major projects that are presently beyond our existing financial resources.

Heller ABDUCTION QUESTIONS I have the following questions about Budd Hopkins' \"Abduction Reflections\" (MUFON UFO JOURNAL, April, 1986): 1. What proportion of people, who describe sperm or ova sampling operations, have, the expected scars? 2. How frequently are scars, abduction recollections, and independent evidence of UFO activity (other than reports given under hypnosis by the subjects) found together? 3. Do people who describe tissue sampling-type experiences ever comment about frequently being mistaken for someone else or looking like someone else? 4. Is there any,way to investigate whether the, families that seem to have been studied over several generations have any relationship to each other, such as common maiden names, or anything in common about their ancestors? 5. Is there anything unusual about the families? 6. Is there an increased frequency -of possible UFO sightings among their in-laws and neighbors? —Irena Scott, Ph.D. Physiology Consultant Columbus, Ohio PROJECT BOLIDE It is possible that many UFOs may turn out to be the product of (1) a physically real stimulus combining with (2) the percipient's mental response to that stimulus resulting in (3) a part-real, part-illusory image which the percipient describes as, and believes to be, wholly real. The response will be as varied as the minds in which it occurs; but the originating stimulus which provides the trigger is likely to be one of a finite, and possibly very limited, number of causes. Many phenomena are described by percipients as 'balls of light'. This catch-all label is no more than a description, but it is sufficient to show that many phenomena generally considered as distinct may have qualities in common. While these may be lim.ited to outward appearance, it is open to conjecture that there may be further correlations relating to structure, behavior and physical nature. Whether study confirms the differences or the similarities, it will in either case contribute to our understanding of the phenomena.; In any case it would seem that this is the facet of the UFO phenomenon which is most amenable to scientific study. The work of Persinger, Devereux and Mattson, together with the critiques of Rutowski, Mauge and others;, the investigations of Project Hessdalen, Project Identification, and the various Spook Light manifest- ations; the researches of Corliss, Gaddis and the McClures, and most recently Clarke & Oldroyd — all these testify to the degree of interest currently being shown by researchers from many disciplines. Since it is by no means certain to what scientific .discipline these phenomena relate, it is no easy matter to co-ordinate research into their nature. Meteorology and the earth sciences are manifestly involved, but hardly less so are mythology and anthropology on the one hand, and on the other physiology, psychology and parapsychology. Yet almost certainly the vast majority of practitioners of these disciplines are unaware of the phenomena occurring on the fringes of their field of study, or of their potential relevance for their work. It is to remedy this situation that there has been set up a project known (continued on page 18) 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Dear Editor, My attention has recently been drawn to the UFO report made by Betty Cash and Vickie Landrum (after an alleged incident near Huffman, Texas, on 1980 Dec. 29). My source of information is John Schuessler's article \"Blind terror in Texas\" in The Unexplained 9(107) 2121-25, (1982). Looking for an astronomical explanation I noticed that the given time (9 p.m.) could not be correct; the witnesses reported seeing the Moon, but the Moon did not rise until just after 1 a.m. Nor is it likely that, after dining out, they were returning home as early as 9 p.m. A more likely time is near midnight.    : Just after midnight Canopus, the second brightest star in the whole sky (magnitude -0.71), lay at only 7° altitude directly south (180°). Highway FM 1485 runs in a dead straight line almost due south for 4 miles on a slight downward gradient (1 in 621 on average). With forest on either side of the road, this would have given the travelers a head- on view of Canopus if they were on that road at the time Canopus was lined up with it. At that low altitude, the light from Canopus would have been both refracted (into spectral colors) and distorted (with streamers to the ground). The description given is consistent with other accounts of stars seen at low altitude. The conclusion must be that Cash and Landrum, not knowing that they were loking at a star, concluded that it was a UFO, ideas about which influenced their perception. Their conclusions that the car became hot and that they suffered burns must be the result of hysteria. One would have liked to know how much alcohol they had consumed and what UFO lore they had already absorbed. One would also have liked to know whether or not the road surface (where they imagined the UFO to be) was affected by heat. I predict that no 16 such damage will have been found. Although it is alleged that the object later moved \"away over the tree tops\" it must be concluded that this later object was not Canopus, which would have disappeared behind the forest. It is not clear from Schuessler's article exactly where subsequent objects were seen, but Jupiter (at magnitude -1.8) later rose in the west (accompanied by- Saturn in close conjunction). The witnesses may have thought that Jupiter was the same UFO. Yours faithfully Stcuart Campbell Scotland TO ALL OF THE MUFON GROUP, Just a note to thank all of you for your very hard and time-consuming work that you have done for Vickie, Colby (Landrum) and myself. Without each of you, I really don't know what we would have done. Please accept my apologies for such people that you have to listen to such as Steuart Campbell. People like that are to be pitied. He said he even doubted our credibility — well I doubt his mentality. All I can say is that it is such a shame it was us. It should have been him and then we would see if he would have said it was a star. Just one day of what we have suffered would have been too much for him — not even speaking of the years. May God bless each and everyone of you for your great work. Betty Cash Alabama Dear Editor, Thought you might be interested in this passage I came across in Mary Kingsley's Travels in West Africa (London, Virago Press, 1982, from a turn-of-the-century original edition), p. 254. Ms. Kingsley was on an 1895 exploration at Lake Ncovi between the Ogowe and Rembwe rivers, then in the region of the Niger Protectorate and Gabon, when she went out at night alone to bathe and canoe on the lake waters. Then: \"...I saw a strange thing happen. Down through the forest on the lake bank opposite came a violet ball the size of a small orange. When it reached the sand beach it hovered along it to and fro close to the ground. In a few minutes another ball of similarly colored light came towards it from behind one of the islets, and the two waver to and fro over the beach, sometimes circling round each other. I made off toward them in the canoe, thinking — as I still do — they were some brand new kind of luminous insect. When I got onto their beach one of them went off into the bushes and the other away over the water. I followed in the canoe, for the water here is very deep and, when I almost thought I had got it, it went down into the water and I could see it glowing as it sunk until it vanished in the depths.\" Later, on asking the natives in this very remote region, they explain it as an \"Aku\" — a devil. There is no further explanation or discussion of the incident. I'd tend to dismiss it as an insect too, except for its underwater dive. Ms. Kingsley is an eminently practical, matter-of-fact, not in the least fanciful observer and a highly intelligent and perceptive travel writer. This incident recalls other \"tiny UFO\" oddities of the sort reported by Fort and others. One more point: the use of the word \"aku\" in West Africa — there's the same correspondence noted in other vocabulary to similar terminology in Polynesia (and elsewhere???). One might speculate about possible widespread dissemination of the same or similar names for spirits in prehistory. But that's really getting into deep waters! -Robert Coltman S. Chelmsford, MA"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Dear Editor, Beware of alleged \"UFO evidence\" when there has been no UFO sighting. This principle applies to photographs of \"UFOs\" when no UFO was seen and other types of reports, but is especially illustrated by the North Carolina UFO Ring article (No. 216, April 1986). No UFO report, nothing to suggest any physical depressions of grass or soil, and no indication that the investigators have checked for natural explanations such as the one that should immediately spring to mind in ring cases: so-called \"fairy rings,\" caused by a few different species of mushroom or fungus (the details of appearance may differ a little depending on which species is involved.) The reader is referred to Allan Hendry's UFO Handbook (Doubleday, 1979, p. 81-83) for some sound advice, and a 1977 case of a \"large gray ring\" (as in the N.C. case) and its scientific identification as a particular species of fungus. Also, see any good encyclopedia under \"fairy rings\" or \"mushrooms.\" My Encyclopedia Britannica (1969), for example, identifies the Marasmius mushroom as a common cause of \"fairy rings.\" For this species, \"Fairy rings persist year after year, with the [ring] diameter gradually increasing and ' segments dying out till the ring can no longer be discerned.\" Growth of the grass in the ring is stimulated in some manner. I am not saying that \"fairy rings\" is the definite .explanation of the N.C. case; only that there is no justification for invoking UFOs until this and other natural explanations are thoroughly investigated. I have written to the N.C. Agriculture Department scientist about the chemical analysis, querying him about the possible fungus explanation, and will share the reply (if any) with the Journal. Richard Hall Brentwood, MD Dear Editor, It is disappointing to see investigators jumping to conclusions. 1 refer to George Fawcett's article on the mystery soil circle. I suspect that this ring is an ordinary manifestation of a fairy ring (see American Heritage Dictionary [1976] page 471, -FAIRY RING). Such fungal artifacts should be familiar to all investigators. They are known to alter .the mineral concentrations of the soil, enriching some minerals and depleting others. Over the period of years the fungal mycelia grow outward from a central point, attaining diameters of ten to fifty feet. Then they fruit often producing a ring of mushrooms (but not in all species). At fruiting or sporing they also produce toxins that may prevent plant growth for several years. To misperceive such occurrences as evidence for UFO landings with no 'other supporting evidence is to show an unhealthy bias. It is just this lack of objectivity which keeps the subject from being taken seriously. The soils should have been analyzed by mycologists for mycelia, fungal tissue and spores. If the subject is to be taken seriously, the quality of investigations must be more thorough. I know George Fawcett well enough to know he supports the extraterrestrial spaceship hypothesis. But, to use dubious evidence not only doesn't provide support, it calls the whole hypothesis into questions. I do not wish to offend George, but some healthy criticism is in order. Lastly, the fairy;ring hypothesis may be difficult to prove at this late date, but deserves at least equal consideration with any others. -David K. Hackett State Director Knoxville, TN Dear Editor, I was sorry to hear that David K. Hackett of Knoxville, MUFON State Director for Tennessee, took issue with the article \"Touch-Down in North Carolina?\" that was'published in the April, 1986 MUFON UFO JOURNAL. The article was written in the hopes of arriving at a solution for the ground markings investigated near Mocksville, N.C. At no time did I jump to conclusions as to the cause of the mystery soil sample, nor did any of the other investigators. In fact in the article we mentioned that all the theories to date were but pure speculations at this point in the continuing investigations. We were stumped primarily by the potassium index measurements found in the circle, in the ring-and outside the 30-foot circle. I was aware of a possible fairy ring explanation, but the Agronomist at the North ' Carolina Department of Agriculture did not mention this in his analysis. I have forwarded a copy of Mr. Hackett's letter to Mr. Tucker at the NCDA for his comments and further evaluation and will respond to the results and response as a follow up in the MUFON UFO Journal in one of its future issues. Finally, I'm glad that we have someone of Mr. Hackett's caliber to offer a second opinion.

To educate the Chilean public about UFOs through the media, public events and, at an appropriate time, a first UFO Symposium in Chile. As I mentioned earlier, the contactee- oriented extraterrestrial philosophies and beliefs pervasive in Chile need to be counteracted by a more sober, informative and scientific view.

BOLIDE is neither a society nor. a publication; it is simply a means for sharing and disseminating information which seems to relate to the various phenomena which come into this deliberately undefined category.

Webb MUFON Astronomy Consultant JUNE 1986 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Venus, brightest celestial object except for the sun and moon, continues to rule the western sky. Gleaming at magnitude -4.0, the planet does not set until almost 11 PM daylight time in midmonth. . Mars, in Sagittarius, now resides in the ESE about 10:30 in mid-June. As the earth catches up to its neighbor world, the red planet appears to back up (retrograde motion) on the 9th and move westward. Mars has brightened to magnitude -2.0, rivaling Jupiter. Amateur astronomers with telescopes should take advantage of the planet's proximity to us. over the next few months. Surface details are more easily discerned as the small world's disc grows larger. In July Mars is nearest earth, its closest in 15 years. . Saturn, in Scorpius, is low in the SE after sunset and advances across the southern sky during the night. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars lies low in the SSW at dawn. The gibbous moon is near the planet on the ' 23rd. -.     • Jupiter, in Aquarius, rises in the east shortly before 1 AM in midmonth and moves to the SE at dawn. The giant world shines at magnitude -2.4. Saturn sets in the WSW about an hour before sunrise in mid-June. Halley's Comet: Binoculars and telescopes are necessary to view the dimming comet. Start watching at the end of evening twilight. The object lies in the obscure constellation of Sextans the Sextant (below Leo) all month, and there it fades from magnitude 7 to 8. On the 1st Halley is 20° up (in midnorthern latitudes) in the WSW and sets about midnight. Moonlight will interfere from about the 10th to 22nd. On the 15th the comet is only 9° up in the WSW as dusk ends and sets soon after 11 PM. Its position is at R.A. 10 h 29 m, Dec. -5° 29'. At that time Halley has receded 213 million miles from earth. By June 27 the faint visitor sets in the west as twilight ends, and during the first few days of July it vanishes in the twilight. After that, only large amateur telescopes can follow it once it emerges in the morning sky in late October.

A diverse group of speakers presented papers. Some of the papers may have been considered controversial from the viewpoint of a conservative scientific Ufologist, however it was an opportunity to meet and evaluate both new and old people in this field. (Each of the speakers had a right to express their personal opinions.) It is imperative that each of us maintains an open mind so that we may study and evaluate facts which might ultimately lead to the solution of the UFO enigma. Any scientist with a closed mind is an insult to his/her profession. HOAX? Continued tremendous speed and disappeared. When they reached the Motel, Tony rushed into the bar to tell everyone what they had seen. All the people there laughed and joked about it and told him to \"take more water with it next time.\" But when he said June had been with him, some of the people changed their minds. June did not drink The Stars: All three stars of that famous heavenly symbol of summer, the Summer Triangle, are now in full view above the eastern horizon after nightfall. The stellar trio is composed of Vega, Deneb, and Altair. Each star making up the triangle resides in its own constellation-respectively, Lyra the Harp, Cygnus the Swan (the \"Northern Cross\"), and Aquila the Eagle. Meanwhile the spring groups-Leo the Lion, Bootes the Herdsman, and Virgo the Maiden-have slid past the celestial meridian into the west. While the Big Dipper begins its downward swing in the NW, Scorpius creeps along the southern horizon. Don't confuse the scorpion's bright red star Antares with the yellowish planet Saturn above it. Directly on the meridian at 11 PM in mid-June is a semicircle of seven stars, Corona Borealis the Northern Crown. It represents the mythical coronet presented to Princess Ariadne by Bacchus. and they knew it. Tony phoned the newspapers and their response was, \"Oh, not another one,\" as there was a flap going on in the country in July, 1975. Once I had the story on tape, I felt I should follow it up with several further investigations, despite the fact that, sadly, it had happened such a long time ago. I tried to contact John Clark to see how he had fared over the years. I drove to Macheke and his house but the people living there had no recollection of him, and even the police station could not tell me where he was. Eventually, through a friend, I was in contact with one of the Directors of the Store where he had worked. John Clark died in about 1982 and his wife had left the country with no forwarding address. At the moment I am trying to get hold of his death certificate to ascertain the cause of death. As far as June Barnes is concerned, I am arranging for her to undergo regressive hypnosis. Although I don't believe that is the perfect solution, it might give us some insight as to what really happened on that Saturday night in July, 1975. Also as I have said, I have written to try and find out what sort of \"odor\" June and Tony smelled. It seems to me a rather sad indictment of our society when UFO investigators like myself are inclined to denigrate cases which don't fit the \"norm,\" particularly in relation to our fellow investigators.
