Stevens The following comments are in- tended as rebuttal to accusations made in Kal K. Korff's article, \"The Meier Incident: The Most Infamous Hoax in Ufology,\" published in the December 1980 issue of MUFON UFO Journal. Critics such as Korff have the ad- vantage, in that it takes much more space to adequately respond to one- line unsupported accusations than it takes to make them. One thing which puzzles me is the fact that exper- ienced researchers have allowed a relatively immature newcomer to be- come their collective spokesman in this case. Kal Korff raises so many misquotes and obviously unsound conclusions that I will have to take them in the order in which they ap- pear in his article. Korff's first mistake, or deliberate distortion, appears in the first five lines of his article, \"recording over 3,000 pages of quotes from them\" (Pleia- dians). The book he refers to clearly says, on page 35 of the First Edition, \"over 3,000 pages of notes on Mr. Meier's phenomenal encounters.\" In the same paragraph, he suggests that we have said the rock and metal specimens \"defy conventional ex- planation.\" The correct phrasing in our book is, \"that, in reference to our present technology, was not immediately explainable.\" Nor do we declare, anywhere in the book, that all, or even any, of Meier's claims are gen- uine. The closest we came to that was on page 43 of the First Edition (page 45, Second Edition), where we said, 'This could very well be the first authentic evidence-supported case of ongoing extraterrestrial contact with Earth humanity ...\" In the third paragraph, we are also misquoted about Meier's \"first ex- periences with extraterrestrials.\" Again, the quote actually reads, \"first evidence of a man's ongoing encounters ...\" We chose to start this book about the encounters with the Pleiadian contact team at the point where those contacts began. Space was our limitation. There were no press releases of any kind ever indicating that Jim Lorenzen, or APRO, \"endorsed the book as be- ing a genuine representation of the facts.\" The statement, furnished in Jim Lorenzen's own handwriting, still on file at Genesis IE Productions, reads, \"At least the preponderance of material is too much for an objective mind to ignore in good conscience\" (signed, Jim Lorenzen). This was used on our own pre-publicarion flyer for the book. After the flyer was printed and in mailing envelopes, Jim (be- cause of flak at home) wanted to add another line to say that at this time, he considered the photographs in the category of excellent art, not science. We agreed to make the change if he wanted to bear the cost of reprinting the flyers; he declined, so we retained the original statement. I am not a one-fourth partner in Genesis III Productions, as Korff alleges, but I do insist that Meier- sought no publicity from anyone con- cerning his experiences. He had already survived four assassination at- tempts by gunfire and certainly didn't seek any more attention. He refused to accept any money for the material he gave me and signed a rights agree- ment without accepting any money, believing that whatever we did in the United States would be a long time in coming back to him. When I asked him about the statement Korff at- tributes to Wilfried Falk (\"that he planned to write a book about his ex- periences as early as 1977\"), Meier said that Falk asked him if he planned to write this up as a book and that his reply to Falk was, \"Perhaps .. . some day.\" In that same paragraph, Korff quotes Lorenzen as saying that I described Meier as \"a sort of person who gets great satisfaction out of fool- ing authorities.\" That is also complete- ly untrue. The correct statement, which Jim Lorenzen never published, is this: \"I had mentioned that Meier was from a very poor family, and his poor clothes and lack of ability to par- ticipate in events at school, for lack of money, set him apart from the other boys, and that he was often made the butt of pranks, and was frequently punished for things he did not do. The statement was, \"Meier learned to smile inwardly when he had to suffer for things he had not done.'\" He con- sidered the inability of the teachers to see through the set-up as a deficiency on their parts. How Lorenzen, or any- one else, got the other completely dif- ferent inference from that, accidental- ly, is difficult for me to see. The book does not say, anywhere, that any of the photographs of the UFOs are authentic. It says, \"Nothing was found\" to indicate trick photography, models, or other suspicious tech- niques. Nothing was found to indicate a hoax. Distance and size measure- ments are proper in relation to loca- tion measurements taken by the in- vestigators and the reported size of the craft is appropriate to the calcula- tions done with computers. Work on the photographs is continuing and we still have not found any way to successfully duplicate them with small models. We did not say, nor does the book imply, that De Anza Systems \"did some of the analysis.\" They aren't even mentioned anywhere in the book. We have stated ekewhere, however, that we used De Anza Computer Graphics equipment because it was the best we had found (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Meier Photos, Continued for this -kind of work. They also had the best \"edge identification man in the business\" working there at the fac- tory and we consulted him. We did the testing. We were looking for the best equipment available for a model laboratory for this particular work, to be financed by a production company who was then interested in making a documentary film on this case. We turned in our report, but the project was later superceded by something else and the lab didn't get funded. We have never demonstrated the photographs to be authentic. Scien- tifically, that cannot be done to any UFO photograph, short of having the ship at hand, with proof of its origin (which would also be unprovable, without going to its supposed point of origin for verification). We said only that we have eliminated the possibil- ity of all known methods of trick photography and lab techniques known to modern photographic science. I have no unpublished paper men- tioning thorough analysis of \"several\" of the Meier photos by Dr. Neil Davis of Design Technology in Poway, California. I have Neil Davis' written report of the analysis of one photo- graph, which I furnished. The analysis was thorough and well done, but it didn't prove the photograph authentic. It did eliminate many lab tricks and hoax techniques. It concluded with a statement that, \"Nothing was found in the examination of the print which could cause me to believe that the ob- ject in the photo is anything other than a large object photographed a distance from the camera.\" There are actually ten photographs of the Swiss Army Mirage jet fighter making passes at the UFO, with the ship high and low, nearer and farther. They are all in a correct sequential order. We have only released one. There is a total of 23 witnesses to the various events described by Meier, each participating in some way at different times. We have taken statements and depositions, both written and oral (and on video tape), and have especially inter- viewed six of the main ones on audio tape for Psychological Stress Evalua- tion testing. They were analyzed by two different PSE agencies using dif- ferent equipment and all were found to believe the answers they gave to the prepared list of questions. Lack of space prevented inclusion of these data in Volume 1. The Pleiadians did not say \"that they originated from the star system of 'the Pleiades.'\" They told Meier they came here from the direction of the constellation we call the Pleiades. They have an entirely different name for it. The Pleiades are not \"only some tens of millions of years old.\" Mr. O. Richard Norton, formerly director of the Flandreau Planetarium at the University of Arizona in Tuc- son, says that the latest calculations show the basic Pleiads are considered to be between 500 million and one billion years old, still relatively young stars, and not old enough to have pro- duced mature life-bearing planets by the same evolution as ours. However, if they were helped from outside, there are other possibilities. The ques- tion is still open. The gaseous neb- ulosity seen around the Pleiades, as shown in the book, has been especial- ly revealed by filters and special ex- posures. That effect is not clearly visi- ble to the naked eye. As for the quotes from the alien cosmonauts, we selected them, not Meier, and we selected the ones that seemed short enough and appropriate to most of the questions being asked, the most popular of which is, \"Do they believe in Jesus Christ?\" They do not advocate any particular belief. They were simply comparing their beliefs to ours. The quotes attributed to James Hurtak have either been copied wrong by Korff or Hurtak doesn't read German as well as he claims, as the aliens contacting Meier said, first of all, that they do not count time the way we do, and secondly, that if we could compare evolutions, it might be said that theirs is about 3000 years ahead of ours, according to the way we count time. The aliens also sug- gested in another contact that, because of the curve of the growth of knowledge, we might be able to achieve many of their capabilities within 300 years of our time, if we would sufficiently concentrate the energies of our planet. They didn't see any possibility of us doing that at this time. They observed that we can't even get along with each other, or nation with nation, very long, and that must be overcome before we can marshall the resources of the world. Korff's next statement is also wrong. The book does not claim that Meier's camera was jammed for sev- eral years. This is an assumption made by Korff from my own statements that Meier's camera was jammed just short of the infinity setting, maybe l/32nd of an inch on the rotating in- dex, for most of the photos which were taken. What he also failed to consider is the fact that all of those photos were made over the first fif- teen months of contacts with the aliens. For the first eight months, they did not let the secret out of a very small group who had only the broken camera that could be held and operated by Meier with his one hand. He had become familiar with it. Also, he never ex- pected to get a second or third set of pictures. He thought each opportuni- ty would probably be his last one. It would have taken weeks to have his camera repaired and he had no money for such expenses. The re- mainder of Korff's statement on camera optics fails to conform to the facts, as anyone with a basic know- ledge of photography will know. The metal samples were actually analyzed at three different labora- tories by three different methods, one of which was the analysis done by Marcel Vogel. What Korff failed to note, or deliberately omitted, is that Vogel only analyzed one single specimen of metal. My very brief summary in the book on Vogel's work with the metal specimen was abstracted from two hours of videotaped analysis and three hours of recorded discussions involving dozens of photographs. All of this is in Mr. Vogel's own words and the tapes are in my possession. We did not release anything other (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Meier Photos, Continued than the preliminary steps, because we agreed that Vogel should be the one to release any particular details at his own pleasure in his own choice of forum. He evidently did not consider Korff an appropriate spokesman. We should not overlook the fact that Marcel Vogel is one of our most brilliant scientists who, as a chemist, has no peers. He is a senior research chemist at IBM's main research labo- ratory. He pioneered luminescence technology, including the develop- ment of fluorescent and phosphores- cent products, did major research on liquid crystals, optical microscopy, magnetic films, etc., and invented the \"floppy disc\" so essential to modern electronic technology. He has pio- neered new experiments in man-plant communication and also in energy transference using prepared crystals. He chose not to share his research findings with Kal Korff. OMNI magazine arranged for a fourth analysis of a specimen of metal, to be conducted at MIT. The letter carrying the piece of metal for analysis took 29 days (First Class Mail) to get from Tucson to OMNl's offices in New York City. Harry Lebelson, an assistant editor of the magazine, advised me that he person- ally delivered it to MIT. The scientists who received the metal from Lebel- son later told him that they lost it before (ratting a good look at it! We should not forget that MIT is a con- tract university used by many agen- cies of the government, including various intelligence agencies. Frankly, I felt from the beginning that if they did find anything interesting, we would be the last to know about it. We did not connect the great struc- tures of history to the Pleiades. We only reported a few of the connec- tions which had already been made by others. There are, in fact, scores of such connections in our files. The ref- erences were identified with quotes from these other sources. Korff seems to take special issue with the reference to the Devil's Tower in Wyoming. Perhaps he is unaware of .the extensive relationship of UFO sightings with this landmark. There is even an old report of a UFO landing on top of the Tower. It is reported that Steven Spielberg's movie company had an actual UFO experience there while filming scenes for \"Close En- counters of the Third Kind,\" but that he played this down to avoid being accused of staging it. Korff's facetious references to Meier having met Jesus Christ stem from a misstatement by Colman von Keviczky, whose distorted views were acquired during his very limited (one day) \"investigation\" of the Meier case. He did not go to the Meier prop- erty, did not interview any of the cur- rent witnesses or civil and military authorities. He did not check or view any of the evidence available at the Meier property, only visited one of the \"contact sites,\" and did not visit any of the photo processing agencies that developed Meier's film. We have heard and are. more in- clined to accept for study, some of the claims to having flown in the space- craft and to have traveled in time, but these are still only stories unfounded in demonstrable fact and we are un- able to test their validity. We have reached no conclusions on such stories at this time. Korff gives me far too much credit when he alleges that I have master- minded this development for some personal reason. To summarize our feelings on the Korff article, it is our opinion that the analysis released by GSW is no more than subjective interpretation of Polaroid photos of non-specific tests, made by Spatial Data Systems from a standard catch-all program on file at SDS for the testing of all UFO photos sent to them by GSW. The results of such tests are neither scientific nor substantive and it seems obvious that Korff does not know the difference. (A discussion of the GSW analysis will be in Part II, next issue.) There is one puzzling thing about this article. I have called a number of the individuals listed in the acknow- ledgements and they tell me that they did not give Korff the information he attributes to them in this article. Some, in fact, were quite angry to Utter OMNI Verltas MUFON readers of the November 1981 OMNI magazine will conclude I have lost my marbles. A \"UFO Up- date\" I wrote on the Betty Hill star map has been editorially rewritten and now contains inaccurate and un- warranted statements that I neither authored nor approved. I did not write anything about the Hill case being \"reveal(ed)\" as the \"most elaborate UFO hoax ever perpetrated.\" This editorial insertion grossly misrepre- sents my outlook on the matter. The breakdown of the Fish interpretation of Mrs. Hill's alien star map returns the abduction claim to unsupported anecdotal testimony . . . but not a deliberate hoax. Other inaccuracies were intro- duced into my original text. I did not describe the Hill's UFO as \"starlike\"; they claim they saw it with large angular size. Also, Mrs. Hill never ex- pressed a \"belief\" in which stars were the aliens' home. Finally, the sen- timents of Terry Dickinson, precisely stated to me for OMNI, were not presented here. I regret that these problems seem attributed to me as the author. Allan Hendry Stone Mountain, Ga.

A car pacing case in New Zealand during July was investigated by Fred and Phyllis Dickeson, Timaru, New Zealand. (An account of the sighting also appeared in the Timaru Herald, July 31.) During April, a pilot in Nevada saw a small disc (a relatively rare but not unknown type of report), and another small disc was seen by an engineer in Minnesota that month. And during March, in South Africa, a businessman was attracted to a cigar-shaped UFO by a buzzing sound from overhead. Details of his sighting contain possible clues to UFO propulsion. Mr. & Mrs. Ken Thew, with their three young daughters, were return- ing home to Temuka, N.Z., from Pleasant Point at 12:50 a.m., Sunday, July 12,1981 along a back road. They suddenly became aware of a brilliant- ly lit green-gold-red object ap- proaching them from the opposite direction (east). The object stopped abruptly, about 200-300 yards away, then changed direction and began pacing the car. As they approached an intersection, they noticed that the UFO was descending even lower, and Mrs. Thew, driving, became fright- ened and sped up from 45 m.p.h. to 65 m.p.h. in an effort to reach the il- luminated area of Temuka township away from the open country. The UFO accelerated to keep pace with the car. Mrs. Thew said the extreme bril- liance of the light emanating from the UFO made the car headlights appear very dim. After a while the UFO came nearer and the family was able to see considerable detail (see sketch). Ken Thew, a mechanic, said the ob- ject was completely silent and \"... it was quite apparent that it was a con- trollable flying object.\" The top part changed from a dark green to a light- New Zealand UFO er shade as the UFO approached; the bottom was red, with a gold tinge in between. On the upper surface were what appeared to be slots or box-like partitions, and square apertures like windows became visible beneath. Mrs. Thew said, \"One could look through them, across a white area within.\" Near one end, on the outside of the object, they saw a sort of figure-eight shaped thing which they described as a \"fat person\" in con- figuration. Further along the road the UFO suddenly shot away to the east. \"One moment it was at point A,\" Ken said, \"the next, at point B. You didn't see it move between the two points, it was just there.\" Reaching the outskirts of Temuka, the Thews elected not to go home right away but instead to try to observe the UFO further. However, it remained off in the distance to the east, so they continued home, arriv- ing at 1:20 a.m. There they were sur- prised to see the UFO hovering about 1,000 feet overhead, but it soon headed away to the east and re- mained visible in the distance, finally disappearing at 2:00 a.m. When the UFO moved, it displayed a fan-like tail of yellow red, as if exhaust; the tail was not visible while the UFO hovered. Pilot On April 20, 1981, a pilot ap- proaching Cannon International Air- port, Reno, Nevada, about 10:15 a.m. sighted a small UFO, estimated to be 3-5 feet in diameter.' Interviewed by Bob Neville, MUFON State Director, Walter Austin, 42, said he and his wife, Judy, were on a landing ap- proach at about 6,000 feet in their Cessna 210 when they saw an appar- ently stationary shiny object at their 2 o'clock position and about 100 feet below them. The object then flut- tered or tilted, accelerated rapidly, and disappeared on a heading of about 190 degrees. - \"When first sighted,\" Austin said, \"we were above the object and saw it below the horizon. As we descended, we viewed it from the same altitude, and then from below it, giving a com- prehensive view of an unmistakable solid object which appeared to be shiny metal.\" His sketch shows the UFO edge-on, flat on the bottom and slightly rounded on top, in the general proportions of a frisbee. Austin broke off the landing and circled back to try to see the UFO again, but without success. It had disappeared toward cloud-shrouded mountains to the south-southwest. Visibility was excellent during the sighting. Upon landing, Austin checked with the ATC approach controller and was told that nothing had ap- peared on radar. The temperature was about 50 degrees F. with little or no wind. Austin has been a licensed pilot for 5 years, with about 300 fly- ing hours per year. He is an electrical contractor and real estate salesman. Buzzing UFO In Uitenhage, South Africa, March 11, 1981, at 7:40 p.m., businessman H. E. Thatcher observed a dark, cigar- (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"BOOK REVIEW Memory, by Elizabeth Loftus (Read- ing, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1980) 207 pp., $5.95 paper, $10.95 hard- cover. This book is a thorough summa- tion of research on how memory operates, compiled by a professor of psychology at the University of Washington. While it does not speci- fically mention UFOs, it provides useful insights for weighing the testi- mony of witnesses who describe UFO encounters, and particularly where information is sought from many years back, or where hypnosis is used. Many people believe that mem- ories last forever; although some details might not come to mind im- mediately, many think that with hyp- nosis or some other technique we can recover that material from a \"permanent storehouse\" in the deep- est part of the brain. Not so, the author says: \"New studies suggest that our memories are continually being altered, trans- formed, and distorted.\" In recalling an experience, we remember some aspects of it, and \"using these facts we construct other facts that prob- ably happened.\" These fragments are then integrated into a logical sequence and a new \"memory\" is created. \"Our biases, expectations, and past knowledge are all used in the filling-in process, leading to dis- tortions in what we remember.\" She states flatly that hypnosis \"doesn't work.\" In one study a group of people were shown a videotape of an accident, then some of them were hypnotized and others were not, and all were asked to describe the accident. The study showed that \". . . hypnosis does not reduce re- trieval difficulties. Quite the con- trary, people appear to be more suggestible and more easily influ- enced.\" Another study relates to situa- tions where the hypnosis seeks to recall material from many years be- fore. College students were regress- ed under hypnosis back to their sixth birthday, and to relive the events of that day. \"The students gave lengthy descriptions, pepper- ed with numerous tiny details. Un- beknownst to these students, the psychologist had gotten descriptions from the students' parents and other sources to compare with the students' memories. The result: Although the 'memories' were rich in detail, they were hopelessly inaccurate.\" Her conclusion on hypnosis and memory: \"No solid studies exist that show recall during a state of hypnosis is any more accurate or complete than recall under ordinary waking condi- tions. What is worse, people under hypnosis have been known to 'recall' events from their past confidently and to fabricate future scenarios with the same confidence.\" She specifically rejects hypnosis as a means of recovering memory of \"lost time\" in a blackout. Although she was referring to alcoholic black- outs ,the findings presumably would also apply to time-lapse blackouts from the shock of a close UFO en- counter. —Robert Wanderer Sightings, Continued shaped UFO after hearing a sound like the humming of bees. He was in- terviewed on behalf of MUFON by Sgt. Christopher M. Powell of the Uitenhage police. Thatcher had just finished pumping water from an underground tank into his water tower and had switched off the elec- tric pump when he became aware of the odd noise emanating from above. Looking up, he saw the dark UFO against the background of light cloud, moving slowly toward the southwest at an altitude of about 600 meters. It appeared to be about 120 m by 30 m wide. \"While I stood looking at the ob- ject,\" Thatcher said, \"I noticed a very intense white light at the extreme front end of the object (in the direc- tion it was moving) flash on and then off. Only once. It appeared to in- crease speed at a phenomenal rate and it disappeared in the southwest in a matter of 5 seconds.\" When the light flashed on, the sound stopped abrupt- ly. When it flashed off, the sound resumed. \"I have a number of geese on the farm,\" Thatcher noted, \"and through- out the duration of the sighting they were silent. Before and after the sighting the geese were making their usual noise.\" Sgt. Powell checked with author- ities and determined that no aircraft or helicopters were in the area. He also checked on Mr. Thatcher's repu- tation, determining that he was con- sidered to be of \"outstanding char- •acter.\" The sighting lasted 10-15 sec- onds. No other witnesses could be located. Small Disc Another small disc, estimated to be 2 feet in diameter and 6 inches thick, was observed on April 12, 1981, in Goodhue, Minnesota, about 1:30 p.m. on a bright, sunny day. R. E. Schenk, 56, a civil engineer from Waterloo, Iowa, was driving south on Highway 58 with his wife, when they saw the object hovering a few feet off the ground about 40 feet away. Schenk stopped to investigate but had no place to park safely, so he drove Small disc: Minnesota on to a place where he could turn around and headed back north. Mrs. Schenk continued to keep the UFO in sight. . They stopped the car and Schenk got out for a better view. At this time the UFO was at an estimated 2,000 to 4,000 feet and climbing rapidly, head- ing northwest toward Minneapolis. It was finally lost to sight in the dis- tance. The UFO appeared to be like alu- minum, slightly wrinkled at the rounded surfaces at each end, with a seam at the equator. (See sketch.) Mr. Schenk was a Navy pilot for 5 years and now operates his own company in Iowa. The case was investigated for MUFON by Forrest R. Lundberg, State Director for Iowa."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"CENTER FOR UFO STUDIES CONFERENCE By Richard Hall (Information and photographs supplied by Thomas P. Deuley.) The Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) convened a wide-ranging conference September 25-27,1981, at a downtown Chicago hotel. Although not large in numbers of attendees, the conference was widely praised for the serious level of discussion and the high quality of papers presented, in- cluding a number of technical anal- yses. Among the speakers were Bertil Kuhlemann of Sweden, and Roberto Pinotti of Italy, with other countries also represented in the submitted papers. The proceedings will be pub- lished. (For information, write to CUFOS, P.O. Box 1402, Evanston, IL 60204). In a continued spirit of cooperation, MUFON officers — including Inter- national Director Walt Andrus, Re- search Director James McCampbell, Associate Director John Schuessler, and Western Regional Director Paul Cemy — attended and participated in the discussions. Schuessler presented an update report on the December 29, 1980, Betty Cash radiation injury case near Huffman, Texas, in which more than 20 \"mystery helicopters\" were involved. One helicopter pilot was located who acknowledged par- ticipating in an operation fitting the general time and location, but he subsequently refused to talk about it. Betty Cash continues to have medical problems as a result of the incident, . and the effects will be monitored by the investigators, including radiologist Peter Rank. Mrs. Cash, her friend Vicky Landrum, and Vicky's grand- son Colby all suffered apparent radia- tion sickness after being confronted by a brilliantly glowing UFO that hovered above the road in front of their car. The technical papers included: . • Analysis of a recorded UFO sound by acoustical expert Howard R. Schechter and J. Allen Hynek;. the sound was established to be unlike any known aircraft or vehicle and ap- parently artificial in nature. • Review of the 1950 McMinnville photographs by optical physicist Bruce S. Maccabee. • Re-examination of the November 1966 Oregon UFO photograph taken by a PhD biochemist, previously dismissed as a hoax for the less-than- scientific reason that it didn't \"fit\" our knowledge. An explanation of the photographic effects was presented in terms of current physical principles. • \"Size, Distance, and Duration Parameters of the Ignition Inter- ference Effect,\" a statistical study based on UFOCAT computer cata- logue data by Donald A. Johnson. • Another statistical analysis of vehicle interference reports by Mark Rodeghier. Donald Johnson The most controversial paper, presented by English professor Alvin H. Lawson, argued that some abduc- tion reports might be a psychological phenomenon based on revivification of birth trauma (BT). Lawson asserted that abduction narratives include im- ages and events from several recog- nized psychological processes, in- cluding BT, hallucinations, and near- death experiences. He cited extensive abduction/BT parallels from the liter- ature. His view was later disputed by Budd Hopkins, author of Missing Budd Hopkins Time, who presented a paper on \"The investigation of Abduction Reports.\" Bertil Kuhlemann described Project URD (Box 454, S-101 26, Stockholm, Sweden), a UFO reporting and data system utilizing formatted report forms and computer analysis to help establish UFOs as a serious scientific problem. Kuhlemann also made a pre- sentation on behalf of the Provisional International Committee on UFO Re- search (PICUR), a newly formed inter- national group in which MUFON par- ticipates, which hopes to establish in- ternational standards of investigation and reporting. At the conference, Dr. J. Allen Hynek was appointed Presi- dent Emeritus of PICUR in recogni- tion of his leadership in the UFO research field. The concept of a \"United Nations\" of Ufology has great appeal to serious UFO research- ers, but many practical problems re- main (including finances). However, PICUR and Project URD have cap- tured the imagination of U.S. re- searchers and could provide a vehicle for improved international coopera- tion. In the sphere of sociological studies, J.

The conference illustrated an im- portant point counter to the skeptical scientific view that 'There is nothing in UFO reports to investigate.\" To the contrary, well-qualified analysts demonstrated the existence of tape recorded UFO sounds, photographs, physical effects data, and sociological phenomena, all of which lend them- selves to systematic study by recog- nized scientific methods.

It only remains for more scientists with appropriate qualifica- tions to become aware of the \"embar- rassment of riches\" of UFO data, and to lend their skills in a concerted ef- fort to study the problem. The CUFOS conference was a positive step in this direction. Among the submitted papers not presented in person, but to be in- cluded in the Proceedings, was one by NASA scientist Richard F.

Schuessler DARK SURFACE One of the more puzzling aspects of the UFO problem is the variety of shapes reported by the witnesses. Predominant are the saucer, cigar, and ball. However, since 1973, there have been an ever increasing number of triangular and diamond shaped ob- jects and a few witnesses have reported objects with five or more sides. Statistically, the number of reported UFOs having five sides is in- significant; but that fact has not eliminated such sightings. The offset- ting factors are the high strangeness of the incident and the high reliability of the witness. Two separate reports from near the city of Houston, Texas, bring the pen- tagonal UFO problem into focus. In- terestingly, both of the incidents took place to the southwest of Houston, and were separated in time by only 9 months. The first incident was reported to MUFON State Section Director Dave Kissinger by an Alief, Texas, high school senior. It was December 1975 and the time was 10:30 ,p.m. when the young woman observed a bright flashing light approaching her home. Immediately, she ran to the window to get a better view and then went outside. The UFO was moving in a northerly direction at an estimated speed of 100-150 mph. It passed directly overhead at no more than 1,000 feet altitude. The view was spectacular as the witness watched the unusual pentagon-shaped object move along flying point forward. In her words, \"... it appeared solid with a sharp outline.\" She described lights on the points and a flashing light in the middle of the bottom sur- face. As the UFO flew away she could see it was not just a flat plate, but had a definite thickness. The only sound detected was a steady hum.

No explanation for the sighting was found. A similar incident occurred during September 1976 when a Missouri City, Texas, oil company executive and his son saw a pentagon-shaped UFO. It was first observed as a steady bright light hovering about one mile to the southwest of the observers' home. After a couple of minutes the object seemed to rise upward and come toward them, flying directly over their heads. Because their home is located on a golf course, they had a wide open area for viewing the strange sight. Their initial reaction was to accept the possibility the ob- ject was a star. Once it started to move they revised the identification to helicopter, and finally to aircraft. However, as the UFO went overhead they could see only a crisply outlined pentagon shape — no wings, tail, or engines. Each point of the pentagon con- tained a steady white light. A blink- ing light marked the center of the bot- tom and 30 to 50 red lights ringed the edge and bottom of the vehicle. Once the UFO began to move it was over- head and out of sight in about 30 seconds. The witnesses estimated the speed to be 200 mph at an altitude of 1,500 feet. The only sound was a \"whoosh\" like a jet engine that had been throttled back. At first only the bright light on the point could be seen. As the object ap- proached, other lights came into view and as it went overhead the total lighting pattern was visible. Then as it (continued on next page) 10"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Pentagonal Continued flew away only the two aft point lights could be seen. Although the witnesses were still skeptical, they notified the Mutual UFO Network. Pentagon-shaped UFOs have been noted in other parts of the world as well. On July -il, 1979, one was sighted over Vigo and Puertos de Morrazo, Spain. A greenish-yellow light emanated from the middle of the bottom surface. Hundreds of people in both cities observed the strange sight. In addition, the crew of a DC-10 airplane flying over the area spotted the same UFO below their aircraft and about 12 miles away. The official explanation given was the American Skylab satellite. Three pentagonal UFOs were seen over West Germany on September 17, 1979. Workers at the Ingolstadt, Bavaria, Audi-NSU car manufacturing plant were the first to report the UFOs. Eyewitnesses said, \"... they were very big and beamed brightly. They flew very fast and without engine noise. In doing so, they flickered yellow and red.\" Ten off- duty police officers watched the three objects as they flew over Ingolstadt in a north-westerly direction toward Eichstaett. Several minutes later Eichstaett police said two of the UFOs flew on to Weissenburg, where police veri- fied their overflight. One of the UFOs hovered at an altitude of 1,500 feet before it flew off at high speed. An Ingolstadt police spokesman said, \"... the observations made by our officers are beyond any doubt.\" Although a nearby air base and the Munich air traffic controller were alerted to the incident, they had no explanation for the phenomenon. A slight departure from the pen- tagonal shape is the octagonal UFO. According to the Watford City, North Dakota, newspaper, local citizen Barb /ohnsrud and her son Kent saw an eight-sided UFO go over their house on November 2, 1978.

She lived in Los Angeles and was friend and cor- respondent to many UFO researchers and investigators throughout the world. She worked closely with a group of us in Los Angeles who regularly exchange UFO news, ideas, and labor together on chosen proj- ects. A veteran in the field, having read, studied, and contributed for over two decades, she subscribed to almost every UFO publication and read all the latest books. She gave generously to the Fund for UFO Research and other worthwhile projects. She con- tributed liberally of her time, money, and intellect. For the past year she assumed the duties of International Coordinator for Africa in the Mutual UFO Net- work. Her time spent on UFOs had been snatched piecemeal between responsibilities to home and family in earlier years. For the past year, however, she was able to spend a few uninterrupted hours each day on research and correspondence. She reveled in this freedom — translating reports from other countries, cor- responding with African UFO re- searchers and others worldwide, writing book reviews, reading the voluminous literature, and attending conferences on UFOs and various metaphysical branches of study. Her eyes and voice always held a smile. Her personality was a magic blend of formal and friendly. You would never hear her speak a harsh word about anyone. When contro- versies arose, she always maintained- an objective attitude, helping work out problems with her own quiet style. Significantly, this objective, quiet attitude was the same which she Barbara Mathey, on couch, talks with APRO members at Los Angeles research group meeting maintained toward UFOs and other world mysteries. Her mind was open to all points of view, and she sought proven Truth. Although basically a private per- son, she extended herself into pursuits of knowledge she felt were important — the nature and motives of UFOs in particular. We in Los Angeles feel her loss deeply. We cannot afford to lose people like Barbara ^Mathey. We attended her service on Satur- day, June 13th at St. Alban's Episcopal Church. It comprised a series of selected readings from .St. Paul, Exodus, and other portions of the Bible, all with the \"theme of human life beyond death in the care of a lov- ing God. We learned later that she had chosen the readings herself. Although she died unexpectedly from a brain hemorrhage with no prior illness, she had taken the time, shortly after her mother's death in 1975, to anticipate her own passing. Barbara was organization itself, even when it came to that. The members of our UFO group tried to comfort each other, but could not accept the sudden loss. She seemed still near and would not ap- prove of senseless grief. Although she died much too soon — considering the contributions she still had to make to her family and to research — she was one of those rare people who had determined the purpose of human life. Her attitude was that life on this material world is merely a prepara- tion for a transformed, immortal life beyond Dearth's plane. Still I could not accept or under- (continued on next page) 12"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"California Report, Continued stand her loss. I wanted to write about her, to share her with others who had not had the privilege of knowing her well, for this would help. But com- mon words seemed insufficient; the thoughts would not flow. On that sorrowful Saturday I went into my garden — a quiet wooded spot where the best of nature's beauty rambles untamed. Everything is welcome there but weeds. Tangled wildwood and flowering vines are mixed with transplants of anything which takes my fancy — an infant fig tree, a beavertail cactus from Tu- junga, wild carnations. Some of us tend to think in sym- • bols, especially when something im- portant is at stake. When phrases do not flow easily, symbols can relate to what has happened so that the ex- perience can be adequately ex- pressed. Symbols flow from the sub- conscious when the mind is at rest, and the mind rests well in the midst of beauty. There in'the garden I found a symbol which helped me understand Barbara's death. It was on a sunny slope, filled with debris and ancient weeds. This slope adjoins our garden but is on our neighbor's property. He cannot see the corner, therefore does not attend to it. Because it needs care, and prevents my own garden from look- ing its best, I have slowly cleared, replanted, and cared for it. That Satur- day, amidst high, dried weeds, a clump of sturdy African daisies were struggling upward, toward the cleared level ground above. Here, some straggling oleanders and other African daisies were attempting 'a comeback, for they once grew pro- fusely there. Barbara, in her generous contribu- tion to all phases of UFO research, had extended herself into a wilder- ness of controversy — weeding out animosities, planting seeds of knowledge among her friends, en- couraging new growth among young investigators. In a way, she was cultivating a neglected corner of a neighbor's garden. And was it mere coincidence, or some thrust of mean- ingful syhchronicity, that African daisies were symbolically concerned? Barbara, although she never discussed it openly, believed that this material world did not occur by itself but had been created to delight our five senses by an organized, loving God. In a symbolic sense, our world is a garden. Her deep searches into UFOs, psychic phenomena, and meta- physical studies gave clues to this, but only those who had the opportunity to talk at length with her realized the firmness of her beliefs. She knew that the material world — the physical world which most scientists insist is the only knowable reality — was only a mere portion of a vast Reality beyond. Her own life experiences, which were a blend of objective and subjective truths, had convinced her of this. A few weeks before she died, we met at a research foundation to discuss a current project. Afterwards we talked in the car for a very long time. The car was perched high over a long slope filled with ancient weeds, slanting down to the busy street below — a scene now strangely reminiscent of the slope .where the hidden African daisies lay waiting to be uncovered. We spoke of life and death, of ex- istence beyond the present, of time and space blending into an infinite Now. She was happy and healthy and looked 'forward eagerly to full par- ticipation in exciting research. We can learn something from Bar- bara Mathey. From her private life she built a bridge, extending herself through laborious study into worlds beyond this one. She knew some- thing that many scientists seem fear- ful of knowing — that as human in- strumentation and detection devices evolve, science will discover more and more of the invisible realms of being beyond our material world, gathering clues to non-material realms and to their Creator. Though some of these realms will then be scientifically analyzable, other detection processes will necessarily come from the subjec- tive recesses of our human minds. With her intelligent, objective ap.- proach, Barbara wondered what^holds back scientists from admitting-a Final GEPAN NOTES In our exchange program with Cen- tre National D'Etudes Spatiales or GEPAN (Groupe D'Etudes Des Phenomenes Aerospatiaux Non Iden- tifies) that was arranged during a per- sonal meeting in Houston, Tex., with Dr. Alain Esterle, MUFON recently received the following six booklets published in French with the titles: Note Dlnformation No. 2 Les etudes de phenomenes aerospatiaux non identifies aux Etats-Unis \"lere Partie: L'enigme des OVNI.\" (This is the Marcia S.

They seem to fear recognizing orderly purpose behind all those things which exist. In that realm of being where Bar- bara now exists, does she reach back to help nurture the \"African daisies,\" quiet controversy, and spread her generosity over all of us?

By Barry H. Downing, PhD Ted Phillips and I had already given our presentations to the 1981 MUFON UFO Symposium at M.I.T., in Cambridge, Mass., as we sat down together to hear the next speaker. Ted said to me, \"How have things changed since you were in Akron in 1974?\" Ted and I had met for the only other time at that conference. Ted's question has led me to a more specific question, which I think needs to be answered for all our MUFON members: What are the religious dimensions to our current UFO quest? And how were these dimen- sions exhibited at the M.I.T. con- ference? The Current Scientific State Before reflecting on the religious dimensions of the conference, let me make some observations concerning the scientific state of our quest for the truth about UFOs. At a press con- ference, our Director Walt Andrus said, \"I don't believe in UFOs. It is not a question of belief. It is a fact. We have the facts and data that UFOs do exist.\" I think this statement not only reflects Walt's views, but reflected the general scientific consensus of the conference participants. Beyond this, I think it was the consensus that UFOs represent some kind of advanced technology, not of earthly origin. Beyond that, however, I think the consensus would begin to break down. The basis for this consensus has many roots. It comes in part from the accumulation of hard evidence of landing traces, as documented by Ted Phillips. It comes from the work of Stanton Friedman, who can give a good set of scientific reasons, as op- posed to Dr. Carl Sagan and others, of why you can get here from there, wherever \"there\" is. It comes from the obviously careful style of Dr. J. Allen Hynek, who keeps his profes- sional skepticism right up front. One of the new pieces of evidence, since Akron, comes from the ex- cellent work of Peter Gersten, who through his legal work has obtained access to government documents which prove, at least in courtroom language, that the United States Government not only knows about UFOs, and has been hiding the evidence, with the \"big lie\" and the Cosmic Watergate as the technique, and that the general view of the government agrees with our MUFON view — that UFOs repre- sent some kind of advanced other- worldly technology. The result of this consensus is a developing \"inner confidence\" in MUFON members that we have not been chasing a \"myth,\" however wide ranging the psychological implica- tions of the UFO reality may be. In the past, the scientific consensus has been, \"we are not sure what UFOs are, but we think they may be important.\" Now we do not know ex- actly what they are, but they are very much like an advanced technology from another world, and the U.S. government knows this. At this con- ference, as Walt Andrus said, there was no scientific \"apology\" for \"believing\" in UFOs. Now we \"know.\" They Are Real — Real What?' In the past our UFO evangelists, like Stan Friedman, have devoted much of their public work trying to convince the public that UFOs are real, as the title of Stan's film suggests. But as the public has come more and more to believe with us that UFOs are real, it is now time to ask the next question, UFOs are Real What? It was in this atmosphere that I at- tended M.I.T. '81, and it was here that I found a big contrast with Akron '74. At Akron, we were still so unsure of our scientific base that the religious questions which I asked seemed to cast doubt on the scientific validity of UFOs. There was much fear at Akron that I might be part of the \"cult nut fringe.\" (I may be, of course.) But at M.I.T. '81,1 found among all the par- ticipants a serious interest in explor- ing the religious dimensions of the UFO issue, and a general understand- ing that good science demands that we look at the religious issues, because they are clearly right there, often at the center of our best and most difficult modem UFO cases, as in Raymond Fowler's work in the Bet- ty Andreasson case. There is as yet no consensus about the abduction cases, and there prob- ably will not be one for some time. But the message of Budd Hopkins in his excellent talk, \"UFO Abductions: The Invisible Epidemic,\" gave us a clear picture of the size of the \"iceberg\" we may be dealing with. UFOs appear to have the ability to ab- duct humans, use semi-hypnotic tech- niques to block out memory, and hav- ing \"programmed\" these humans, then release them back into society without conscious memory of the ex- perience. Under hypnosis, we can discover the evidence — probably. Or maybe. In any case, there may be thousands of Betty Hills and Betty Andreassons all over the world. That leads us quickly to consider very seriously the developing theory of Jacques Vallee, as in his book Messengers of Deception, that UFOs are a \"control\" mechanism. They control and direct the unconscious beliefs of the human race. Or as Quazgaa said to Betty Andreasson, \"All things have been planned.\" (Fowler, The An- dreasson Affair, p. 111). Whoever they are, they think they are in charge. In the past, we have called the one in charge God. Now what do we do? At M.I.T. '81, the new scientific con- sensus has led to an openness to this question, to a realization that we can- not keep \"scientific\" UFO questions (continued on next page) 14"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Religion, Continued and \"religious\" UFO questions separate. With a view toward open- ing up more dialogue between the scientific and religious disciplines, especially from my own Christian point of view, I gave as my talk, \"Faith, Theory and UFOs.\" The Sectarian Problem After one of our evening meals, I sat down with Dr. Hynek for a few minutes and asked him, \"What has the CUFOS group done with the issue of UFOs and religion? And he said, \"Not much.\" He also said, in effect, that he was concerned about the over- all impact of UFOs on all religions, not just the Christian religion. This is a serious concern, and it hides a rather more negative question which might be, \"How do we keep UFO groups like MUFON or CUFOS from being taken over by Christian evangelists?\" I think that Dr. Hynek, and many other \"scientists,\" are rightly con- cerned that people like myself, with a very specific religious point of view, may turn our UFO groups like MUFON into sectarian religious groups, or maybe even nothing more than sophisticated scientific cults. In other words, how can we, from a scientific point of view, ask religious questions without \"selling out our science?\" The tension is there, I felt it during the conference, and it cuts both ways. I spent quite a bit of time talking with John Oswald, who has written a huge manuscript, which uses a system of logic to prove that the Christian view of reality, and our current UFO view of reality, are logically identical, and MUFON ought to be able to see this, and announce it to the world. While I agree with John that the Christian reality and the UFO reality are basically \"one,\" that is my \"faith-,\" at the same time, I can see many other \"options\" or \"theories\" and so I am not as frustrated as John with the cur- rent state of MUFON \"unbelief.\" But John has expressed his frustration openly, and the \"scientific\" side of MUFON has to worry about this evangelical Christian view. The tension was also there during the question period following the presentation by Ray Fowler and Betty Andreasson on Sunday morning. Bet- ty had said that she believed she was chosen by God for her abduction by the angels of God to help prepare the human race for the Second Coming of Christ. A woman in the audience, who was an obvious child of our secular age, did not want to hear Bet- ty placing such an obvious Christian message right at the center of her ex- perience. And in Ray Fowler's book on the abduction, he keeps offering the option of saying, 'This is no longer scientific fact. This is Betty im- posing her Christian beliefs on the ex- perience.\" When we arrive at Betty's eagle, it seems like a good place to draw the line \"scientifically.\" Yet, there are really no good scientific reasons to draw the line there, only reasons imposed by the skepticism of our secular age. What are we to do about the \"sec- tarian\" problem? That is, how are we to listen to Betty Andreasson's message about the Second Coming of Christ, and yet remain \"objectively scientific\"? Maybe we cannot. But one thing the MUFON com- munity can do is to learn to \"objec- tify\" the religious UFO stories, such as Betty's. Christian scholars do this all the time. What do I mean? The Christian doctrine of the Second Coming of Christ is basically a doc- trine of coming Last Judgement. It is a doctrine that says that there will come a time in human history when Christ, acting for God, will judge every human. All the major world religions have a teaching concerning a Day of Judge- ment. It is central to the Jewish religion, and to Islam, which is an off- shoot of both Judaism and Christian- ity. Although the Jewish religion does not see Christ as judge, it does believe all humans will be held accountable to God, and likewise to Islam. In regard to Hinduism, and its child, Buddhism, the law of Karma is similar to the biblical religion of judgement. In other words, we live under spiritual laws, and if we \"do well,\" we pass on to a higher form of life, and if we do badly, we are rein- carnated into a \"lower\" form of life. So far as I know, there is a concept of \"judgement\" at the center of every major world religion, and we may very well expect that UFOs, as a world-wide reality, have left this mark in every religion. Indeed, it is central to my own view of what 'life is about.\" In my M.I.T. talk I spoke of \"God's game\" being a faith game, and at the end of the game, God adds up our score. We are now living in God's laboratory, going through a series of tests, and our future beyond death depends on how we meet these tests. Can Science and Religion Live in Peace? I believe we in MUFON know that the religious questions must be faced. It will not be easy. First of all, the Jewish-Christian community, which represents the religious cultural matrix in which MUFON operates, is not a unified matrix, and will not pre- sent a unified response as the UFO religious questions are asked. After Betty Andreasson's presenta- tion, a woman in the audience came up to me — an evangelical Christian — and she was in great fear. She was literally shaking as she talked to me, and she had some tears. She had been told that UFOs were of the devil by her church. If her church was right, Betty Andreasson was an agent of the devil — a surprise to Betty, who believes (as I do) that she is an agent of God. But a very large segment of the Protestant — and perhaps Roman Catholic — community, as Cynthia Hind explained of her African En- counters, will see UFOs as of the Devil. And Jacques Vallee seems to make a good \"secular demonic\" case to support this view (see my article, \"Demonic Theory of UFOs,\" in The Encyclopedia of UFOs). The devil-angel theory will not have a quick painless solution in the years ahead. I can well understand why the MUFON scientific community (like Dr. Hynek) would not want to be- (continued on nexl page) 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"UFO SECRECY UPDATE H and ChutZpah By Larry W.

Dak.); or he might be a megalomaniac seeking a perma- nent place in history; or a self- appointed media-reformer bent on teaching the tabloids a lesson in responsible journalism; • or any com- bination of the above. Perhaps some day hell tell all, and by so doing join the ranks of such legendary hoaxers as Clifford Irving (the pseudo- Howard Hughes biographer) and that occasional medical doctor whose celebrated written findings prove bogus upon independent testing. In the meantime, all we can do is savor the meat, juice, and spice of his gem of a put-on. The three-page doc- ument in question — typed single- spaced on a blank form titled In- cident/Complaint Report — is at first glance a typical account of an atypical event. All the names, dates, and places are there. All the identity fac- tors of the principals (including social security numbers) are there; all the particulars of who-did-what-to-whom are spelled out in the chronological narrative of the \"Remarks\" section of the form. In short, it makes a neat package. Too neat. For on the second glance I'd given it upon receipt of my copy, I couldn't help concluding that this cleverly crafted account was reveling in the chance to insult my in- telligence. In the first place, logic tells us that no document containing the details of an official \"close encounter of the third kind\" would bear a security classification lower than TOP SECRET. As it is, it's stamped \"FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY,\" which tech- nically isn't a classification. In the second place, the narrative itself seems too good to be true: the intruders on that night of November 16, 1977, sporting exotic dress and weaponry; the challenging security guards mounting a feeble attack/- counterattack; the \"evidence\" of the UFO landing and nuclear-missile tam- pering being turned over to the F.B.I, and the AF Office of Special In- vestigations; and the intimation that the incident will undergo follow-up investigation and high-level classifica- tion of the results. Finally: to anyone with a working knowledge of the garden variety of official UFO docu- mentation that's been made available to the public, this alleged incident report simply fails to fit the mold. Perhaps lacking that degree of knowledgeability, and at the same time giving the \"leaker\" the benefit of the doubt, the recipient tabloid chose to launch a thorough check into the document's authenticity. I'm told by a source close to the investigation that the officials at Ellsworth have bent over backwards to assist in the gather- ing of testimony and other data lead- ing to a resolution of the issue. Everything thus far produced — in- cluding voice-stress analysis — points to a deliberate, well-engineered hoax, brought off with as much chutzpah as any hoax in history. If the perpetrator in this case be- moans his having been so premature- ly exposed, he might take some com- fort in knowing that he has indirectly performed a public service. For exam- ple, his feat of foolery puts the UFO- research community on notice that they are ever vulnerable to such a trap as this. It also reminds official- dom of the extent to which their in- difference to the perennial \"UFO problem\" can backfire at the hands of resident clowns. But perhaps the ultimate value of the Ellsworth Hoax lies in its inadver- tent contribution to the sociol- ogy/psychology of the hoax phenom- enon in general. In this connection it might be useful for one or two hoax- ologists to acquire (via the U.S. Freedom of Information Act, of course) all government records per- taining to the investigation of the hoax. That material ought to provide fascinating insight into the anti-hoax mentality of the \"authorities.\"!!] 16"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Letters Abduction Effects Editor, In response to Arkansas State Director Bill Leet's letter in the May 1981 issue (No. 159) pointing out the enlightenment that might be gained by follow-up investigations into the effects resulting in the lives of those reporting abduction by or other con- tact with the alien operators of UFOs, and noting no such reports of such studies have come to his attention, I would like to call attention to one such attempt, of recent publication, namely: Direct Encounters: 'the personal histories of UFO abductees by Judith M. and Alan L Gansburg, published by Walker & Co. (720 Fifth Avenue, New York City 10019) in 1980. This appears to be a first endeavor to determine the effect on the lives of a number of individuals in well- known cases .of abduction and to be carefully and objectively done. It may very well be that more of value will be learned about the UFO phenomenon and its significance by investigating the influence UFO con- tacts have on the individuals involved than all the inquiry into behavior, motive power, physical characteristics and the like of the reported craft. It would seem, after over 30 years of in- vestigation, that these visitors are not likely to give us clues to their superior technology, knowing to what aggres- sive use we would surely put it, and instead are trying to awake us to values we must first acquire for the sake of our own evolution. In any event, we can get some inkling of their intent through follow-up in- vestigations of those most directly affected (and perhaps chosen) — the abductees themselves. Robert S. Camburn Glenside, Pa. Had Your Phil? Editor, Three cheers for Quentin Fogarty, our \"Down Under\" friend involved in the New Zealand photo case, for his excellent and revealing article, \"A Klassical Encounter,\" in the March issue (No. 157). His interpretation of the resulting heated session is so typical of the rude, crude, and twisted distortions routinely belched out by our great hero of the debunking world. We should all be reminded that this mere handful of \"Klassics\" is only outnumbered by about 10,000 to 1. At least the positive side can boast no government funding. And what a pity; think of all we could do for scientific UFO research if we had some. Mr. Fogarty's article in my estima- tion, should have had a subtitle — \"Or, How to Insult a Guest in our Country.\" Mr. Fogarty should be highly commended for having the courage to stand up to the \"scorn, in- nuendo, sarcasm, and attempted char- acter assassination\" for which Mr. Klass is so famous. Whenever I read anything about Klass & Co. ridiculing credible witnessess such as Fogarty and Larry Coyne plus many others, it en- courages me to redouble my efforts into more intensive accelerated research. I would heartily recommend the reader to do likewise. The one thing that bothers these absurd gentry more than anything is to have their fanatical efforts and clumsy attempts at debunking completely ignored, especially by the news media and any exposure to the general public. Now we have Mr. Fogarty's junior agitator, Bobby Schaeffer. He is re- ferred to here in our area as the \"Sorcerer's Apprentice,\" a sort of \"yes man\" for P. K. Mr. Schaeffer has recently turned up here in San Jose, California from the Washington, D.C. area and has already begun his seem- ingly obvious plan within this most active pro-UFO area group by infil- trating Tom Gates' college lecture, visiting MUFON's Research Director, Jim McCampbell, and appearing as a guest on a KGO radio talk show, M.C.'d by a complete and admitted disinterested communicaster. Remember folks, the key word is IGNORE! As Dr. James McDonald used to say, \"Klass dismissed!\" Paul Cerny Western States Director Response to Greenwell Editor, This is a response to Greenwell's retrieval rebuttal (No. 161, July 1981). Greenwell's anecdotal mate- rials fail to provide convincing rejoin- der to the testimony of individuals most of whom were not acquainted. The crux of this argument lies in failure to admit that the testimony of so-called \"junior specialists\" may be as significant, and at least as ethical, as the silence of so-called \"senior special- ists.\" Greenwell must know that fail- ure to testify is not recognized as evidence. Greenwell believes that junior spe- cialists may be less likely to maintain the secrecy of controlled data than one might expect of those higher on the totem. Indeed, the list of String- field's witnesses indicates that Greenwell might be correct. But such admission does nothing constructive for Greenwell's thesis. Does Green- well really believe that junior special- ists are more likely to lie than those who have ascended higher into the academic apex? What would be the basis of such assertion? The extended reference to senior specialists as \"outside contractors\" is a subterfuge since essentially the same controls exist for classified material in government as in industry or in uni- versity work. Government funding of numerous experimental studies is well known. Support of these programs produces jobs. A senior specialist who is milking the cow, certainly does not want it to go dry. Neither does the in- stitution being funded. The more de- pendent one becomes on such fund- ing, and subject to departmental and administrative pressure, the less likely is one to compromise. Greenwell has indicated that the controls sometimes break, and it is this writer's view that Stringfield's witnesses may be an excellent exam- ple. So, as one might expect, the hole in the dike has appeared not amongst those who have the most to lose but out of the broad circle of those who have the least. Virgil Staff Berkeley, Calif. 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"HISTORICAL MT. SHASTA CASE By Steven Adams In an interview on May 27, 1967, Paul Cerny, then Chairman of the Bay Area Sub- committee of NICAP, learned that Captain jack Brown of the Mount Shasta, Califor- nia, Police Department, had encountered a peculiar craft-like object in the early morning hours of a July morning in 1966. The following article is based on Mr. Cerny's report. At 3:00 a.m. while on duty and patrolling the northwest city limits of Mount Shasta, Capt. Brown first observed the object through his car's windshield. The UFO closed with him rapidly, apparently on a collision course with the patrol car. To avoid a crash, Brown swerved violently, barely missing a ditch, and came to an abrupt halt. Fear and plans to escape by foot in case the UFO exhibited any further hostilities prompted the police officer to get out of the car and lean on the open door, one foot planted on the door frame. The alleged craft, a smooth disc, ap- proximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter and 10 to 12 feet thick, hovered silently 20 to 30 feet above the car and emitted a blue-white glow which seemed particularly bright at the disc's rim. The intensity of the light hurt Brown's eyes as he gazed upward at the disc. The object had no visible windows or openings; however, on its underside were two thick tubular protrusions, curved and tapered, about eight inches around at the ends, skid-like in appearance, but with no perceived function. Also, Capt. Brown commented that he detected no exhaust trails coming from these structures. Brown stated that after the ap- parent craft lingered for 3 or 4 minutes, it drifted off, moving er- ratically across the road and adjacent fields \"as if nonchalantly surveying the immediate area.\" Suddenly the object shot off toward the slopes of Mt. Shasta where it stopped and hovered again before accelerating a second time. It climbed eastward over the mountain and disappeared. The patrol car's headlights and two- way radio functioned normally throughout the encounter. In fact, Brown contacted his dispatcher, David Vacari, who after dashing to a window sighted the glowing object in Brown's reported vicinity. Further- more, Officer Mazzeri, 8 miles north of Mount Shasta in the town of Weed, spotted the UFO heading for the mountain but did not observe the object hovering over the car because the terrain blocked his view. (Mr. Cerny saw fit to point out the absence of electro-magnetic effects on Brown's body and automobile: the captain experienced no paralysis or tingling sensations, and as previously stated, the car performed as usual dur- ing the incident.) According to Mr. Cerny, Capt. Brown, 42 and a family man, seemed well above average intelligence, physically fit, in good mental health, and, in short, a competent observer. Capt. Brown claimed that he would be reluctant to report any future sightings because of the way the Air Force had handled his first report. Evidently, the Air Force insisted on his completing many tedious and ir- relevant forms and report sheets before informing him that what he and his fellow officers had seen was something other than what they had described. CORRECTION A printing error appeared in Jennie Zeidman's comment (No. 160, June 1981) on the Klass-Fogarty exchange about the New Zealand UFO movie films. The word \"disclosure\" was substituted for \"discourse.\" The sentence should read: \"I would no more attempt dis- course with him (Klass) than with a tantrum-throwing, hysterical 6-year- old.\" MUFON 1030LDTOWNERD.

There are, without doubt, any number of legitimate criticisms which could be aimed in Hynek's direction, but this is hardly one of them.

William \"Bill\" Hassel, State Director, presiding officer, introduced Joseph Kirk Thomas as his replacement as State Section Director for Los Angeles County. Joe resides at 2220 South Beverly Glen No. 114, Los Angeles, CA 90064, telephone: (213) 556-2192. Holding a Masters Degree in physics, he has been a research specialist in electromagnetics for MUFON. As Chairman for the 1983 MUFON UFO Symposium, to be hosted by Southern California, Bill Hassel utilized the occasion to initiate planning for this prestigious event. A unique feature of their meeting was an invitation by Marilyn Epper-. son to J. Allen Hynek and Walt An- drus to participate from Evanston, 111., and Seguin, Tex., via a telephone loudspeaker amplifier. Each passed along greetings and an appropriate message for this auspicious occasion. Your director answered questions from the assembled group in the Ep- person living room. Other MUFON officers present were Willard D. Nelson, State Section Director for Orange County; Melvin Podell, State Section Director for San Diego Coun- ty; Mrs. Ann Druffel, Associate Editor of the MUFON UFO Journal; and Mrs. Idabel Epperson, Advisor to the Southern California group. The Center for UFO Studies Scien- tific Conference on September 25th through 27th at the Midland Hotel in downtown Chicago was a memorable event for all of us who were fortunate to attend. We were especially proud of the numerous MUFON members who spoke at this distinguished^ffair. They were Alan Holt, Dr. Bruce Mac- cabee, John Schuessler, Dr. Irwin Wieder, Dr. Alvin H. Lawson, Dr. Ron Westrum, and Budd Hopkins. Other qualified speakers were Bertil Kuhlemann (Sweden), Gordon Mel- ton, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Roberto Pinotti (Italy), Barbara Schutte, John Timmerman, Donald Johnson, and Mark Rodeghier. Mark Rodeghier is to be congratulated for his outstand- ing job in organizing and planning this conference. A San Francisco Bay Area group of six was headed by Directors Paul Cerny and Jim Me- Campbell. Another media for communica- tions was used on September 13th, -when your director had the privilege of visiting with Jane Thomas (LU6DSM) in Buenos Aires, Argen- tina, via amateur radio station K5RF in Seguin. Robert Florstedt (K5RF) has a schedule with Jane Thomas for every other Sunday at 1:00 PM C.D.S.T. or C.S.T. on 28.916.3 megahertz. Jane had responded by let- ter to our inquiry to set up an interna- tional MUFON amateur net. We in- vite others to join us on ten meters. Jane is best known for her work in translating UFO accounts published in Spanish to English for the Journal, Lou Parish, Ted Bloecher, and others. Her schedule is October the llth and 25th and November 8th and 22nd. Dennis W. Stacy, Director of Publications, represented MUFON at the recent Second London Interna- tional UFO Congress as reported in the August 1981 issue of the Journal. He also substituted for Michael Sinclair, International Coordinator, who was accepted as MUFON's per- manent delegate to the Provisional In- ternational Committee on UFO Research (PICUR). Bertil Kuhlemann (Sweden) proposed the international adoption of Project UFO Research Data (URD), a two-fold program designed to coordinate in-the-field data gathering with computer analysis of the data. James McCampbell, MUFON Director for Research, will meet with Mr. Bertil Kuhlemann and Stan Lindgren, both representing Project URD, to discuss inputs and ap- plications of the proposal for potential MUFON utilization. Since we are in the process of composing the third edition of our Field Investigator's Manual, this would be an appropriate time to evaluate and consider the Swedish (URD) proposition. In the August 1981 issue of the Journal, your International Director elaborated on five steps to expand the subscription distribution of the Jour- nal and MUFON membership. In sub- sequent 'Director's Message\" col- umns, other ideas will be suggested that will help to develop MUFON as a worldwide UFO investigative or- ganization. Frequently new members ask the question, \"What are the duties of a State Section Director?\" In this edition of the Journal, we will concen- trate on procedures and proposals that will strengthen our state organizations. 1. Organize state groups, headed by a State Director. 2. State Director to select an Assis- tant State Director to cover a portion of the state or actively assist the Director in administrative functions. 3. The State Director should seek and appoint State Section Directors for one county or a group of counties depending upon population density or geographic square mile area. The qualifications should be based upon leadership, interest, and time to devote to Ufology. 4. State Section Directors are ad- vised to conduct monthly meetings. On many cases this is already being done in a local MUFON-affiliated UFO group.) 5. State and State Section Directors should be constantly searching for competent, interested people to recruit as Field Investigators, Research Specialists, and Field Investigator Trainees. 6.
