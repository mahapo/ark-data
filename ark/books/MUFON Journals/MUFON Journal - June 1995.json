One year later Brookings produced the report, which remains, 36 years after the contract was let, the foundation for the broad policy considerations of America's efforts in space. From time to time this report is cited by ufologists because it contains several passages dealing with the question, should the Government release to the public evidence of extraterrestrial presence, current or in the past, discovered in the course of NASA's voyages beyond Earth? Unfortunately, the Brookings Report is not easily available. The Institute maintains a library, but they do not stock copies of the Report, and seem bemused by the occasional requests they receive for it. I obtained a copy through the inter-library loan service, in a volume called House Reports, Volume 2, Miscellaneous Reports on Public Bills, II, 87th Congress, 1st Session, January 3-September 27, 1961. From the Report I have culled those fragments which discuss the issue of extraterrestrial life, and the implications of discovery of such life forms or their remnant artifacts. These are presented below. A few of the passages reproduced here do not directly address the topic, but have relevance in the context of current discussion in the UFO research com- munity about the proper role of scientists in communicating UFO data to the public. In reading this material, one should keep in mind that in 1959 there was very little public sentiment to the effect that \"flying saucers\" might rep- resent an immediate, real contact with extraterrestrial life. We tend to assume that NASA's work is entirely technological, \"hard\" science. But the policy considerations are the domain of social scientists, and the Brookings Report relies almost completely on a small army of leading ad- ministrators and academics in the \"soft\" sciences. Fifty-seven researchers and collaborators are named, and another 200 experts were interviewed. Because of the superlative credentials of so many of the participants, it is fair to say that the Report represents the consensus of the technocratic \"Establishment\" circa 1959. It may be instructive to compare the Brookings Report with the CIA's Robertson Panel report on UFOs, which was written six years earlier. To the best of my knowledge, these are the only known examples of a systematic analysis of the role of government in dealing with the public on the topic of extraterrestrial life. The Robertson panel was convened in secret by the CIA, and was composed of only five members, all physicists. The Brookings study was pursuant to a public announcement, operated openly throughout, and, as noted above, re- lied on over 250 experts. The Robertson report was released decades later through the Freedom of Information Act crowbar. The Brookings report has been accessible to the public since its original publication. The Robertson panel studied a small set of \"best\" UFO cases carefully selected by the officials of Project Bluebook, apparently with the help of the Battelle Institute's Project Stork staff. With dazzling speed — only 12 hours were spent reviewing the UFO files — they dismissed the physical reality of UFOs, and then plunged into the realm of the social scientists with an amazing vigor and insouciance. The panel recommendations are noteworthy for their ominous, almost totalitarian tone, the confidence with which such pivotal public policy advice was given, and of course the complete lack of reliance on expertise in the political and social areas they chose to address.

This education could be ac- complished by mass media such as television, motion pictures, and popular articles...\" And further, \"Such a program should tend to reduce the current gullibility of the public and consequently their susceptibility to clever hostile pro- paganda.\" This handful of physicists did not shrink from making extremely broad political policy statements, as in the fol- lowing: \"The continued emphasis on the reporting of these phenomena does, in these parlous times, result in a threat to the orderly functioning of the protective organs of the body politic.\" In order to implement these policy decisions, they recommended using Walt Disney and Arthur Godfrey in the psychological warfare campaign, as well as sys- tematic debunking of UFO cases, and federal intelligence service surveillance of civilian UFO research organizations. The Brookings Report stands in sharp contrast. The writing is characterized by depth of thought and by a schol- arly but gently humanistic approach to the awesome job of assessing and then guiding the impact of space exploration on mankind. And instead of issuing an order for action demanding political and scientific \"correctness,\" the Brookings scholars repeatedly ask for further studies to insure that when the terrible decision must be made, it is made on the very best advice. Q uotations from the Report are presented in the sequence in which they appear in the text. Spelling and hy- phenation have been reproduced exactly, so that in some places we read \"earth,\" and in others \"Earth.\" Some pas- sages have been arbitrarily broken into smaller paragraphs. \"Certain potential products or consequences of space ac- tivities imply such a high degree of change in world condi- tions that it would be unprofitable within the purview of this report to propose research on them. Examples include a con- trolled thermonuclear fusion rocket power source and face-to- face meetings with extraterrestrials.\" (p.2) \"Governments warned publicly of disasters with which they have little competence for coping may be seriously em- barrassed.\" (p. 14. This statement is not in the context of the ETI issue, but resonates so well with the UFO problem that 1 take the liberty of including it here.) \"Though intelligent or semi-intelligent life conceivably exists elsewhere in our solar system, if intelligent extrater- restrial life is discovered in the next 20 years, it will very prob- ably be by radio telescope from other solar systems. Evidences of its existence might also be found in artifacts left on the moon or other planets. The consequences for attitudes and val- ues are unpredictable, but would vary profoundly in different cultures and between groups within complex societies; a cru- cial factor would be the nature of the communication be- tween us and the other beings. Whether or not earth would be inspired to an all-out space effort by such a discovery is moot: societies sure of their own place in the universe have disintegrated when confronted by a superior society, and oth- ers have survived even though changed. Clearly, the better we can come to understand the factors involved in responding to such crises the better prepared we may be.\" (p.30) \"While the discovery of intelligent life in other parts of the universe is not likely in the immediate future, it could never- theless happen at any time. Whenever it does occur its con- sequences for earth attitudes and values may be profound. Hence a long-term research effort, which would aid in prepar- ing for this possibility, could usefully begin with a continuing determination of emotional and intellectual understanding and attitudes regarding the possibility and consequences of discovering intelligent extraterrestrial life.\" (p.32) \"While space activities offer a special opportunity to study the relationship of innovation to social change, understanding the relationship will require examination of other innovation situations, too. Research is recommended to determine: What factors historically have entered into support or rejection of new ideas or technologies. What was and wasn't appreci- ated about the potentialities (or lack of them) in the innovation and under what personal and social circumstances did this oc- cur? In particular, what were the roles of physical environ- ment, politics, personalities, limited systems analysis capa- bilities, insufficient communications to decision makers, etc.?\" (p.32) \"Developments growing out of space activities themselves could possibly change the operation and character of the social context to such a degree that it would not be profitable to rec- ommend research now on the implications of space activities for the new social context. For example, the development of a compact thermonuclear fusion power source for spacecraft would undoubtedly open up space for many kinds of large- scale activities — but it would very likely also change the po- litical, social, and economic features of the earth radically, since unlimited power for all uses would soon be available. The resulting interaction between space and society would be comprised of factors too broad and too complex for useful speculation in our study. So, too, with such developments as antigravity, a face-to-face meeting with intelligent extrater- restrials, or an intensive pannational attitude favoring all-out scientific research (as a result of the salutary consequences of space research).\" (p.35) \"Today, vast beehives of scientists are mobilized and or- ganized, under the auspices of governmental bureaucracies that dispose of the resources of whole nations, for the ad- vancement of applied science and technology.

The implication for human society is plain. Individuals will have to be brought together in beehives that will have to be combined, in turn, to form superbeehives — until at last, perhaps the whole of mankind is brought within one central- ized organization that operates the civilization of the future, maintaining and regulating the artificial environment that it provides.\" (p.106, footnote quoting Louis J. Halle, \"The Natural History of Man's Emergence Into Space,\" in International Political Implications of Activities in Outer Space, Joseph M. Goldsen, editor, Rand Corp. Report R- 362-RC (I960).) \"A scientist may feel a deep conflict about his role when, for example, as an agent of a Federal department he might be asked to call a military space vehicle a 'scientific satellite,' in the interests of national security. Should he be a free agent with science as his only master, or must he always remain a representative of his country, regardless of his scientific role, behaving in a manner consistent with the interests and policies of his country?\" (p. 153, footnote) \"There is the tendency to take the attitude of a few distin- guished scientists, usually physicists, as representing the sci- entific community. There is reason to believe that there is a vast difference between the attitudes of a few men of genius whose lives have generally been in the best sort of academic milieu and the attitudes of the general run of scientists in different disciplines. We have noted that technology has be- come so complicated that the scientists must personally be brought into the processes of policy decision since nobody else can effectively advise on the utilization of modern in- struments. In this process the prestige of the scientist rises, he becomes absorbed into the political elite, perhaps he brings some of his universalistic values with him and perhaps he abandons some as he identifies more fully with the power structure of which he is a part. These are questions that need examination and exploration. \"We want to know how far scientists have been assimilated into the decision process itself, in both of the power blocs, and we also wish to know how far under such circumstances they may be counted upon to retain a value orientation charjcicr- istic of science itself and how far do they become indistin- guishable from other decision makers. Is this introduction of scientists into the decision process a means to humanize and make more intelligible that process or does it simply politicize the scientist, or is it a little of both, and if so, under what cir- cumstances do we find each result?\" (p.153, footnote) T he following lengthy passage appears under the head- ing, \"The implications of a discovery of extraterrestrial life.\" Together with extensive footnotes, it is the Brookings Report's most articulated statement on the topic. I have been told, but can't confirm, that this section was the work of the celebrated anthropoligist Margaret Mead. \"Recent publicity given to efforts to detect extraterres- trial messages via radio telescope has popularized — and le- gitimized — speculations about the impact of such a discov- ery on human values. It is conceivable that there is semi-in- telligent life in some part of our solar system or highly intel- ligent life which is not technologically oriented, and many cosmologists and astronomers think it very likely that there is intelligent life in many other solar systems. While face-to-face meetings with it will not occur within the next 20 years (unless its technology is more advanced than ours, qualifying it to visit Earth), artifacts left at some point in time by these life forms might possibly.be discovered through our space activ- ities on the Moon, Mars, or Venus.\" If there is any contact to be made during the next 20 years it would most likely be by radio — which would indicate that these beings had at least equaled our own technological level. \"An individual's reactions to such a radio contact would in part depend on his cultural, religious, and social background, as well as on the actions of those he considered authorities and leaders, and their behavior, in turn would in part depend on their cultural, social and religious environment. The discovery would certainly be front-page news everywhere; the degree of political or social repercussion would probably depend on leadership's interpretation of (1) its own role, (2) threats to that role, and (3) national and personal opportunities to take advantage of the disruption or reinforcement of the attitudes and values of others. \"Since leadership itself might have great need to gage the direction and intensity of public attitudes, to strengthen its own morale and for decision making purposes, it would be most advantageous to have more to go on than personal opin- ions about the opinions of the public and other leadership groups. \"The knowledge that life existed in other parts of the uni- verse might lead to a greater unity of men on Earth, based on the 'oneness' of man or on the age-old assumption that any stranger is threatening. Much would depend on what, if any- thing, was communicated between man and the other be- ings: since after the discovery there will be years of silence (because even the closest stars are several light-years away, an exchange of radio communication would take twice the num- ber of light-years separating our Sun from theirs), the fact that such beings existed might become simply one of the facts of life but probably not one calling for action. \"Whether certain earthmen would be inspired to all-out space efforts by such a discovery is a moot question. Anthropological files contain many examples of societies, sure of their place in the universe, which have disintegrated when they had to associate with previously unfamiliar soci- eties espousing different ideas and different life ways; others that survived such an experience usually did so by paying the price of changes in values and attitudes and behavior. \"Since intelligent life might be discovered at any time via the radio telescope research presently underway, and since the consequences of such a discovery are unpredictable because of our limited knowledge of behavior under even an approx- imation of such dramatic circumstances, two research areas can be recommended: \"(a) Continuing studies to determine emotional and intel- lectual understanding, and attitudes — and successive alter- ations of them if any — regarding the possibility and conse- quences of discovering intelligent extraterrestrial life.

What might be the role of the discov- ering scientists and other decision makers regarding release of the fact of discovery?\" (p.215, emphasis added) \"The positions of the major American religious denomi- nations, the Christian sects, and the eastern religions on the matter of extraterrestrial life need elucidation. Consider the following: \"The Fundamentalist (and antiscience) sects are growing apace around the world and, as missionary enterprises, may have schools and a good deal of literature attached to them. One of the important things is that, where they are active, they appeal to the illiterate and semiliterate (including, as mis- sions, the preachers as well as the congregation) and can pile up a very influential following in terms of numbers. For them, the discovery of other life — rather than any other space product — would be electrifying. Since the main ones among these sects are broadly international in their scope and are, in some places, a news source, the principal distrib- utors of mass media materials, an important source of value interpretation, a central social institution, an educational in- stitution, an so on, some scattered studies need to be made both in their home centers and churches and their missions, in relation to attitudes about space activities and extraterrestrial life. Additionally, because of the international effects of space activities and, in the event of its happening, of the discovery of extraterrestrial life, even though space activities are not in- ternationalized, it is very important to take account of other major religions.\" So, for example, Buddhist priests are heav- ily politically engaged in Ceylon. So, too, in Burma, many politically active men (including U Nu) are professedly active Buddhists. The Burmese con- voked the sixth great Buddhist Council which brought to- gether a huge international group of Buddhist lay and eccle- siastical leaders and it seems likely that — at least in the case of Theravada Buddhism — with the wide participation of modern-educated, politically active men, Buddhist beliefs and principles are being reinterpreted. We need, and we do not have, good observations or interpretive statements about the possible repercussions of these space activities, etc., for these Buddhists. ''If plant life or some subhuman intelligence were found on Mars or Venus, for example, there is on the face of it no good reason to suppose these discoveries, after the original novelty had been exploited to the fullest and worn off, would result in substantial changes in perspectives or philosophy in large parts of the American public, at least any more than, let us say, did the discovery of the coelacanth or the panda. It might well be that this sort of discovery would simply not be sufficiently salient for most people most of the time to cause any noticeable shift in philosophy or perspective. \"If superintelligence is discovered, the results become quite unpredictable. It is possible that if the intelligence of these creatures were sufficiently superior to ours, they would choose to have little if any contact with us. On the face of it, there is no reason to believe that we might learn a great deal from them, especially if their physiology and psychology were substantially different from ours. \"It has been speculated that, of all groups, scientists and en- gineers might be the most devastated by the discovery of relatively superior creatures, since these professions are most clearly associated with the mastery of nature, rather than with the understanding and expression of man. Advanced understanding of nature might vitiate all our theories at the very least, if not also require a culture and perhaps a brain in- accessible to earth scientists. Nature belongs to all creatures, but man's aspirations, motives, history, attitudes, etc., are presumably the proper study of man. It would also depend, of course, on how their intelligence were expressed; it does not necessarily follow that they would excel technologically. \"It is perhaps interesting to note that when asked what the consequences of the discovery of superior life would be, an audience of Saturday Review readership chose, for the most part, not to answer the question at all, in spite of their de- tailed answers to many other speculative questions. Perhaps the idea is so foreign that even this readership was bemused by it. But one can speculate, too, that the idea of intellectually superior creatures may be anxiety-provoking. Nor is it clear what would be the reactions to creatures of approximately equal and communicable intelligence to ours. \"What may perhaps present a particularly knotty philo- sophical problem, and one which would seem most clearly to have the potential of profound repercussions for our values and attitudes and philosophies, could arise if we discovered a creature whose intelligence and behavior, by our standards, was indeterminate to the point that we were unable to decide whether or not it should be treated morally and ethically as if it were a 'human being.' Certainly, this could provide a con- tinuing subject of controversy across and within various earth cultures; some people who had not otherwise speculated on these matters might gain a sense of the complexity of the universe. For a convincing presentation of this idea, see Vercours, 'You Shall Know Them,' Pocket Books (1955).\" (p.225) UNITED NATIONS VIDEO On October 2, 1992, a UFO presentation was made at the United Nations in an effort to reopen Decision GA 33/426.

PAGE 6 NUMBER 326 JUNE 1995"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL THE PURPORTED 1947 ROSWELL FILM By Kent Jeffrey T he last 18 months have been quite eventful with respect to Roswell. In January of last year, Congressman Steven Schiff of Albuquerque, New Mexico, announced to the press that he was requesting the General Accounting Office (GAO) to look into the Roswell case. Nine months later, the Air Force, possibly in an attempt to upstage the GAO, and in what Newsweek magazine called a \"preemptive strike,\" re- leased its own report on the Roswell incident. The Air Force report was the first official word on the Roswell matter in 47 years and basically supported (although without offering any proof) the original 1947 \"cover story\" that the officers of the 509th Atomic Bomb Group were fooled by the remains of a downed balloon and ML-307 radar reflector. Now, a new factor has entered the picture. A film has surfaced in England that is supposedly top secret docu- mentary footage taken at Roswell in 1947 by a U.S. military photographer. The existence of the film was first announced last January; however, the film was allegedly purchased in the United States almost two years ago. Needless to say, the film has generated much interest and controversy, along with a variety of opinions from UFO researchers and members of the media as to its authen- ticity. As author of the Roswell Declaration and coordinator of the International Roswell Initiative, I have attempted when possible to maintain neutrality on controversial is- sues within the UFO research community and to avoid the infighting that, unfortunately, has so often charac- terized this field. I have felt that maintaining a neutral stance was important and appropriate, especially in view of the fact that the Roswell Declaration and the grassroots effort behind it has had the unified support of the three largest and most respected UFO organizations in the United States, the Mutual UFO Network (MU- FON), the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies (CU- FOS), and the Fund for UFO Research (FUFOR). Furthermore, over 17,000 people, from varying back- grounds, including hundreds of scientists and engineers, have signed and submitted copies of the Roswell Declaration. While I have primarily concentrated my efforts on achieving the objective of the Roswell Declaration — an Executive Order to declassify any existing U.S. gov- ernment-held information concerning UFOs or ex- traterrestrial intelligence — I have also become in- volved with researching the Roswell case. In the past two years, I have made five trips to Roswell, visited the debris site at the Foster (Brazel) ranch, and interviewed many of the surviving Roswell witnesses. I believe such experience gives me a definite advantage in evaluating any alleged Roswell film footage. The film in question is presently in the possession of a company in London, Merlin Productions, owned by a Mr. Ray Santilli. On Friday, May 5, 1995, there was a special showing at the Museum of London. There were approximately one hundred people present: members of the media (including the BBC), potential buyers of the film, and UFO researchers from the United Kingdom and other countries. Despite the fact that the film is to- tally unauthenticated, it has received extensive publicity in Europe. For example, the film has been featured in full-length feature articles in London's Sunday People and Berlin's Morgen Post. Because of the dubious nature of the film and the questionable way in which it is being handled by those in possession of it, there is a tremendous potential for damage to the entire Roswell effort. Because I was the only Roswell researcher at the May 5th showing, I feel a responsibility to put neutrality aside and speak out. Before going into specific details about the viewing, I would like to state up front and unequivocally that there is no (zero!!!) doubt in my mind that this film is a fraud. I might add, however, that if, against all odds, what I consider the impossible did occur, and this film actually turned out to be genuine, I would be one of the first to celebrate, as researchers would finally have in their possession the Holy. Grail of evidence necessary to break the Roswell case wide open. T he actual showing of the film took place just after 1:00 p.m. in a small auditorium that is part of the Museum of London complex. A handout was distributed at the sign-in table consisting of a copy of the alleged MJ-12 briefing papers and a yellow cover sheet refer- encing the 1947 Roswell crash and the 509th Bomb Group (at Roswell Army Air Field). Merlin Productions was apparently very concerned about pictures being taken because everyone was physically searched (frisked) for cameras upon entering the auditorium. There was no speaker or announcement to formally welcome those present or to introduce the film. This seemed somewhat bizarre and discourteous, as people had come from all over the world for this showing. Also conspicuously absent was a person on stage after- ward to publicly answer questions pertaining to the film. After having viewed what was presented, however, it was not hard to understand why this was the case. Prior to the showing, anticipation was high. In the previous three months, Ray Santilli had put out the word through those in close contact with him that the film consisted of 15 10-minute reels (in their original JUNE 1995 NUMBER 326 PAGE?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL / have little doubt that the body was a doc- tored human corpse. If such is the case, it would make this one of the most despica- ble and deplorable hoaxes ever perpe- trated.

If this is deter- mined to be the case, a criminal investiga- tion might well be in order. canisters) of 16-millimeter black-and-white film, for a total of 150 minutes. He reported that it was dated as 1947 vintage film stock and that it had been acquired from a former army photographer, Jack Barnett, who claims to have shot the footage and then, incredibly, to have stolen 15 canisters of film, without the theft having been detected. Word was also put out that there was 45 minutes of footage taken at the actual recovery site showing a number of soldiers in uniform and a large crane lifting the crashed craft onto a truck, Additionally, Santilli claimed that one of the scenes showed President Truman behind a glass partition with such clarity that someone capable of lip reading would be able to deter- mine his words when he spoke. At the showing, we would see none of this — no debris site, no soldiers, no crane, no crashed saucer, no President Truman. Instead, we saw just 20 to 25 minutes of one single scene — an autopsy of a supposed alien body in a small white room. - At about 1:05 p.m., the lights dimmed and the film started rolling. Before the actual picture began, a few short statements scrolled by on the screen with reference to the film having been \"acquired from the cameraman who originally shot the footage\" and to the copyright be- ing \"exclusively owned by Merlin Communications.\" Interestingly, one would think that if the film were gen- uine, the copyright would be \"exclusively owned\" by the United States government. A lso, contrary to what had been said previously about \"10-minute reels,\" there was now a statement on the screen that the film was recorded on \"three-minute\" reels. I recently learned from a good friend in the film industry that 1947 vintage 16-millimeter film came on reels of 100 feet, which at 16 frames per second would be about three minutes each. Perhaps this information was also \"recently learned\" by Merlin Productions and that is why we are now seeing references to \"three- minute\" reels instead of the originally reported \"10- minute\" reels. The film opened abruptly with its single scene of a small operating or autopsy room with plain white walls and a table in the middle containing an unclad body lying face up. Two individuals in white anti-contami- nation suits, complete with hoods and narrow, rectan- gular glass faceplates, were the only figures visible in the room. A third person, dressed in white hospital-type garb, was visible through a large glass partition, or win- dow. Although he was outside the sealed room standing behind solid glass, he was wearing a surgical mask that covered his entire face. Perhaps there was concern that he might later be recognized? The features of the body lying on the autopsy table in this film do not even come close to what was described by the 1947 Roswell witnesses. What was visible on the screen was apparently a slightly doctored human corpse. While in theory it could have been an elaborate dummy, the chances of that are remote. I, along with others with whom I've spoken who were also at the viewing, have little doubt that the body was a doctored human corpse. If such is the case, it would make this one of the most despicable and deplorable hoaxes ever perpetrated. It would mean that those who put this atrocity together butchered the body of a once-living human being (a woman in this case) solely out of greed. If this is deter- mined to be the case, a criminal investigation might well be in order, as using a human body for such un- scrupulous purposes is not only highly unethical, but also illegal in most places. Although the exact height of the body was difficult to determine, it was definitely shorter than normal, proba- bly somewhere around four and a half to five feet. The head was somewhat large relative to the torso, but not extraordinarily so. The body was also barrel-chested and apparently bowlegged. and had an overall stocky ap- pearance. Other anomalous features included no visible body hair, small and somewhat odd-shaped ears, a small (slightly abnormal-shaped) nose, slightly large eyes covered by black membranes (which were later re- moved), a distended or bloated abdomen (ascites). six digits on the feet (polydactylism), apparently six digits on the hands, and legs so badly swollen that the defini- tion of the knee was hardly recognizable. According to medical people with whom I spoke, none of these fea- tures would have been too difficult to produce artifi- cially. The black membranes covering the eyes, for ex- ample, could have been placed over the eyeballs with the same apparent ease with which they were removed dur- ing the alleged autopsy. The sixth digit could have been added using the techniques of plastic surgery, although polydactylism itself is not that uncommon a condition. It was also pointed out that some of the abnormalities of the body could have been attributable to a genetic defect or even a physical ailment prior to death. For example, congestive heart failure could explain the swelling (edema) of the legs and the bloated appearance of the ab- domen (ascites).

It had what was basically a human head, a human torso, human skin, human legs, human arms, human shoulders, human hands, and human feet — all in basically the right pro- portions. The ratio of the length of the upper arms to the lower arms, as well as the ratio of the upper legs to the lower legs, was exactly what would be expected for a human being. The musculature of the arms and legs appeared the same as the musculature of human arms and legs. The relative positions of the forehead, eyes, nose, ears, mouth, and chin were very close to what would be expected on a human head. Although the eye- balls appeared larger than normal, the size of the eye sockets did not appear that abnormal. Other distinctly human features included the mouth, lips, teeth (the front-lower teeth were momentarily visible in one shot), jowls, noticeable protrusions of underlying bones in just the right places, including the jaw, shin, and clavicle, a brief glimpse of what appeared to resemble a flat- tened nipple area (although no protrusion of the breast), female genitalia, fingers, a thumb, toes, and even a brief glimpse of a toenail (a human vestigial remain!). During the supposed autopsy procedure, the body cavity was cut open lengthwise from the throat to the groin and various internal organs were removed and placed in metal pans. The focus,.or resolution, was so poor, however, that whatever was removed appeared simply as dark blobs, with detail being almost impossi- ble to discern. There did appear at times to be a small amount of dark fluid oozing from the body cavity. Basically, the body shown in this film appeared to be that of a short, adult, human, Caucasian female, with the age being difficult to determine. The swollen legs and other minor \"modifications,\" such as an extra digit on the hands and feet, and the \"doctoring up\" of the eyes and ears, resulted in an overall slightly freakish appear- ance. Professor Jared Diamond of the UCLA Medical School, in his book The Third'Chimpanzee, states that there is a \"98.4 percent\" similarity in the genes of hu- mans and chimpanzees (our closest primate relative). The resemblance between a chimpanzee and a human being is slight compared with the resemblance between the body in this film and a normal human being. The body in the film was extremely human, albeit somewhat abnormal in appearance. It does not take a scientific mind or much imagination to realize that it would re- quire a genetic similarity far greater than the 98.4 per- cent between man and chimp to produce a being as close in appearance to a normal human as was the body on the autopsy table in this film. It is common knowledge that the human organism, like all other life forms on earth, is the product of ap- proximately three billion years of evolution, involving untold numbers of mutations and trillions of chance combinations of genes. Exobiologists tell us that the chances of billions of years of evolution on another planet resulting in \"the fine structural details\" of a hu- man being are all but zero. While differences would be vast, there would, however, likely be some basic simi- larities between us and any other species that became technologically advanced. Such features as two legs (bipedal), two arms, a high level of dexterity, two eyes (binocular vision for depth perception), and a large brain would almost surely be required for any species to evolve as a tool user and maker. I recently discussed this matter with an acquaintance who is a science professor at a Midwestern university and who has a background in biochemistry, human bi- ology, human genetics, and exobiology. He agreed that parallel evolutionary development in another world over billions of years leading to an advanced organism so nearly identical to a human being would never happen. The laws of probability rule it out. It can therefore be stated definitively that the body in this film is not of ex- traterrestrial origin. The film is a fraud. In addition to the \"fatal flaw\" of anthropomorphism — probably the result of scientific illiteracy as well as sheer ignorance on the part of its producers — the film has other problems, most of which are of a more cir- cumstantial nature. For example, the photography did not seem consistent with what one would expect for the documentation of an historic medical event. There was excessive panning and poor focus with the majority of close-ups. Also, most of the close-up shots were too fleeting, allowing no time for serious study or observa- tion. The gestures of the two \"physicians\" seemed ex- aggerated and even staged at times. Although it is purely speculative, one would think that for such a monumen- tal event, there would have been a large team of spe- cialists directly participating, along with a number of ad- ditional specialists observing from behind the glass par- tition. E stablishing this film as a hoax is much easier than determining the source of the hoax. It is possible that Ray Santilli and Merlin Productions are themselves vic- tims of a scam. However, it must be said that their ac- tions in the last few months do not seem consistent with those of an organization confident that it is in pos- session of the \"genuine article.\" Among other things, Mr. Santilli has mentioned a secret viewing for church officials, a private viewing for the counter-intelligence wing of the FBI, verification of the film by Kodak as 1947 vintage, and, most recently, an offer from an undis- closed client represented by a Washington, DC, law firm for $1.8 million to purchase the film \"as is.\" None of these claims has been verified. Furthermore, no one has seen any of the alleged footage of the debris site or that showing President Truman. Even more significantly, no one has been able to verify the existence of the photographer, Jack Barnett. If JUNE 1995 NUMBER 326 PAGE 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL this film were genuine and such a photographer actually existed, the government would undoubtedly know his identity. Since he reportedly stole and subsequently sold 15 canisters of top-secret U.S. government film, he would be in serious trouble. His best protection would be to go public immediately. The government would then be in a Catch-22 situation because if they so much as raised a finger against him, they would be instantly val- idating the entire Roswell event. On January 19, 1995, 1 wrote a letter that was passed on to Mr. Santilli in which I mentioned the prestigious Washington. DC, law firm I retained two years ago for the purpose of providing legal counsel for Roswell wit- nesses. I pointed out the importance of the photographer in validating the film and offered the services of the law firm to represent the photographer. That offer was never accepted. After having viewed the May 5, 1995, show- ing of the film, I now know why. Either the supposed photographer is one of those behind this hoax, or else he does not exist. Over the last years, the three major nonprofit UFO re- search organizations in the United States, along with a number of private individuals operating on their own time and at their own expense, have put a lot of re- sources and effort into the admirable cause of getting to the truth of what could well be the \"story of the millen- nium.\" Although it is still very much an uphill struggle, much progress has been made in bringing to the Roswell case serious and credible attention on the part of the me- dia, the public, and a number of politicians. It is unfor- tunate that there are now those who would unscrupu- lously exploit the Roswell Event for their own financial gain. It is important that the UFO community make every effort to get to the bottom of this matter as soon as pos- sible, including calling for a criminal investigation if it is determined appropriate. Standing by and doing noth- ing could be a serious mistake. Unfortunately, although they may be in the minority, there are journalists and television producers out there who are far more inter- ested in the possible sensationalistic appeal of this kind of film, than in bringing people the truth. As the hype and publicity surrounding this film continue, there is a real danger that people will start to connect the reality of the Roswell event with the authenticity of this film. Then, once the film is publicly exposed as a hoax, which it inevitably will be, there is a real danger that people will tend to assume that the whole Roswell event is a hoax. Fortunately, however, as experts obtain more infor- mation about the true nature of this purported Roswell footage, the entire matter of this film should be nipped at the bud and put to rest. Attention and resources can again be concentrated on the actual Roswell event, the best documented case in the history of the UFO phe- nomenon. ADDENDUM The investigation of the Roswell case is still very much an ongoing affair. Despite the passage of nearly 48 years, new witnesses are still being sought by re- searchers, as many of those involved were young enough at the time to still be alive today. Reportedly, the GAO report on Roswell will be out in July. It is also re- ported that the Air Force will be coming out with a fol- low up to their September 8, 1994, report on Roswell which, according to the report itself, was supposed to be their \"final word\" on the subject. (\"The lady doth protest too much.\" — Shakespeare, \"Hamlet\") The International Roswell Initiative is also an ongo- ing concern. With the count of Roswell Declarations well over 17,000 so far, signed Declarations are still being received. A special Web page for the International Roswell Initiative is now being set up on the Internet. With this new feature, it will be possible to fill out and \"sign\" a Roswell Declaration \"electronically.\" This could increase the numbers significantly. It will also be possible to download from the Web page all future bulletins of the International Roswell Initiative. (Previous bulletins will also be made avail- able.) Bulletins will be issued periodically and will cover events concerning the progress of the Roswell investigation as well as the Roswell Initiative. The 1994 Air Force report (another \"piece of deceit,\" albeit of a different sort) will also be addressed in a future bulletin.

Betty Andreasson Luca, and Whitley Strieber. Longtime UFO researcher Raymond Fowler's chron- icling of Betty Andreasson Luca's abduction experi- ences has resulted in three landmark classics in the field, The Andreasson Affair. The Andreasson Affair Phase II, and The Watchers. The name of Whitley Strieber instantly conjures up images of his national bestsellers Communion and Transformation, two books which combined to breathe new life into the field of UFO abductions and put the subject on the map with a whole new reading public who had never taken the subject seriously before. Another thing Fowler and Strieber have in common is their past statements that their previous books were the last statements on the subject that they were going to make, which is now contradicted by the fact that they both have recently decided to go another round with us and offer new books about the kind of UFO experi- ences that made their initial reputation. 1 asked Fowler in a phone conversation this past April why he had decided to do a new book based on Betty Luca's .experiences after having told me. in an in- terview conducted back in 1991, that he felt he had completed his work with Betty, and that the message the aliens were trying to send to mankind through her had basically been completed. \"Apparently,\" Fowler said, \"the Andreasson Affair is a never-ending story. The experiences continue to hap- pen, and new information continues to come forth. 1 felt obligated not to let go and to hold on and to continue to monitor the family. It's a family that I've monitored now for almost two decades. I will go on record, though, that The Andreasson Legacy [Fowler's current work-in-progress] will be the absolutely last book on the Andreasson Affair. Others can take up the monitoring of the family if they want, but I've just reached the end of it for myself.\" So, with the publication this July of The Watchers II: Exploring UFOs and The Near Death Experience (Wild Flower Press), the fourth installment in the series of books dealing mainly with the abduction accounts ob- tained through the hypnotic regression of New England housewife Betty Andreasson Luca, Fowler will bring the story up-to-date and reinforce many of the points made earlier on in the narrative. For instance, Betty Luca remains unwavering in her opinion that she is in contact with angelic servants of God, whom she calls the Watchers (her word for the greys) and the Elders (which is what she calls the Nordics). Her abductors are doing God's will, she told me recently. \"And God's will is very complicated and complex,\" she said. \"And it affects the entire Universe, And so, we have to remain calm. One of the Elders told me that they were pleased that I was remaining very calm, and for me to keep on remaining calm, even when I am expressing and telling people about what is happening to me. Remember what Jesus said. 'Perfect love casts out all fear.' The only perfect love is God, and when your body, soul, and spirit are in unity with His will, well, then there's perfect love present. I still feel fear when an abduction event is happening. But it's diminished quite a bit.\" Fowler admits that he is still at a loss to explain why Betty perceives the aliens in the way she does, and why she was chosen to begin with.\"It's hard for me to see,\" Fowler said, \"how a fundamentalist Christian like Betty—that these things are coming out through some- one like that. She's the last type of person that you would think that this stuff would be coming out of. It's very disconcerting to me, the whole thing. But again, it's based on Betty and other people like her who seem to be especially chosen to experience these things and bring them to man.\" Fowler said he began to see in the experiences of Betty Luca something not exactly \"spiritual,\" but what he prefers to call \"paraphysical,\" after hearing about her 1967 experience with a three-dimensional Phoenix (recounted in the first book in the series, The Andreasson Affair), which the aliens used to illustrate some point they were trying to make about the immortality of the soul. \"The message was obvious,\" Fowler said, \"that the Phoenix experience was talking about immortality and rebirth and so forth, although it was hard to place that in a UFO context at the time. And then when she had her first experience with The One [The Andreasson Affair, Phase //] and went to a place called 'Home,' a world of light, and met this loving presence, it reminded me of the Near Death Experience at that time.\" After a few more experiences were related to Fowler by both Betty and her husband Bob that lead again to a connection with NDE's, Fowler decided to do a de- tailed study of the NDE and compare it with the Lucas' experiences. The results of that study make up a great deal of The Watchers II, and Fowler has already begun to brace himself for what he expects to be an over-all re- jection of his new findings by both the UFO research community and the reading public. \"I feel that a lot of newcomers to Ufology,\" Fowler said, \"and a lot of the oldtimers still consider UFOs to be a 'nuts and bolts' phenomenon—entities from another JUNE 1995 NUMBER 326 PAGE I I"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL star system coming here in physical ships and being very, very physical in nature. And when you bring up the possibility that other dimensions and some other things, for example, that Betty Luca has experienced, they feel that these things are an aberration and that they don't fit the real picture. I think I mention in the book that Budd Hopkins said at the MIT Abduction Conference that experiences of a theological or spiritual or paraphysical nature, that whole thing was 'the biggest cloud on the horizon,' that it was essentially a waste of time to bother with that aspect of the UFO phenomenon. And I think he has a lot of company, and I was one of that company at one time. But the whole thing will be so far out to so many minds out there that it would be very, very hard to defend.\" W hitley Strieber is certainly also familiar with at- tempts to defend what he continues to describe as his \"enormously complicated\" abduction experiences at the hands of what he still calls \"The Visitors.\" And Strieber is also making somewhat of a surprise return to a field he had six years ago declared that he was leaving behind forever. Streiber's new book is called Breakthrough: The Next Step (Harper Collins Publishers). \"Breakthrough is really written for people who have had the encounter experience,\" Strieber said, \"and for people who are interested in it. Beyond that, I don't know what the public reaction will be7and it doesn't re- ally matter very much to me, either. I'm not really in- terested in convincing the general public that this is true. What I'm interested in is reaching people who are involved in some way with the experience with infor- mation about it. Affirmation about the level of reality on' which it exists. And strategies, however good or inept they may be, that I've evolved to deal with them.\" And what does Strieber anticipate will be the reaction of the UFO research community? \"That's really not an answerable question,\" Strieber said, \"and it's too complicated. That community exists in so many different levels that it's really hard to know. I mean, the reaction to it-will range from one of interest to one of rejection, obviously. I don't think there would be a consensus reaction on the part of the whole com- munity. I'd be very surprised. That would be a first.\" And the real reason for going public again with new information? \"Well. I withdrew in 1989,\" Strieber said, \"because I had gotten the proof, the thing I regarded as proof, and which would be proof certainly to anyone who's had anything remotely resembling these experiences. And I had noticed that not only Communion, but anything anybody does publicly involving this experience, seems to bring it closer to people. And I just didn't feel like I wanted to necessarily do that until I had some clearer idea of what in the heck was going on. So, I tried to set- tle in my own mind the question, Could I at least deal with this in some way that was useful to me? That I would consider valuable? Because, if I couldn't, then why bother? I don't really care much about what the Visitors want or don't want to get out of it, or even why they're here. My interest and my focus is on what do I get out of it? What good is it for me? If it was nothing for me except a lot of scary experiences in the middle of the night, then, frankly, the hell with it. \"But if I could make something valuable out of it,\" Streiber continued, \"then it would be worth continu- ing. And I found that, for me, I did make something valuable out of it. And I wanted to communicate that that was possible because I began to see that it was a rare and useful experience, and one that I think that a lot of people would welcome in their lives as long as they had some means of handling it that resulted in they're getting benefits from it.\" So, two veteran warhorses offer their rationales for a return to the battlefront of truth versus falsehood in the great ongoing war between the differing theories of what UFO abductions are and why they are happen- ing. Having reneged on their earlier decisions to with- draw completely, both Raymond Fowler (along with his research subject Betty Andreasson Luca) and Whitley Strieber take another shot, and we listen with them in the stillness to hear if anyone shoots back.

EYEWITNESS REPORT: THE SO-CALLED \"ROSWELL FILM\" Meeting at the Museum of London London, UK - Friday, May 5, 1995 Editor's Note: Several months ago, a British pop music promoter named Ray Santilli claimed he was in posses- sion of movie film allegedly shot at the scene of the UFO crash near Roswell, New Mexico in 1947. Ever since, speculation as to the content and authenticity of this film has run rampant. Recently, Santilli invited me- dia representatives and researchers to a showing of a brief segment of the film at the Museum of London. This event took place on May 5. Colin Andrews, a noted British crop circle researcher now residing in the United States, was among those in- vited to the private showing. Colin sent a report to the United States from his UK office shortly after the event. The text of his report [slightly edited] follows: The meeting started at 1:00 PM, in the lecture theatre. We arrived at 12:30 PM. Many familiar faces were there, some as follows: George Wingfield, Robert Irving, Bob Kiviat (Fox/Paramount Films), Phillip Mantle (BU- FORA), Michael Hessemann (Germany), Nick Pope (MOD — Ministry of Defence — UK Government), Carlton TV — UK, BBC radio I — UK, Daily Express UK, NBC — USA, many other media; Reg Presley (Troggs pop group), Ray Santilli (Film owner), re- searchers from Italy and Germany, John Holman — UK, Kent Jeffrey — USA; total approx. 100. Everybody was frisked and NO cameras or recorders, etc. were allowed inside the theatre. The showing started at 5 minutes past one with no introduction; the lights were simply turned off. The film started by saying: \"The film you are about to see is taken from 16 mm original films on 3 minute-long canisters and was pur- chased from the person who filmed it. All copyright is with Merlin Communications Ltd.\" Description of film: At a table in a well-equipped [operating] theatre, two people in white outfits and hoods and visors over eyes (all-in-one suits) were inspecting the being. A third per- son was observing from behind a glass screen in the wall of the theatre; he/she was also wearing an outfit with a larger glass visor. One of the surgeons looked closely at the body and was gesturing where he/she would be cutting and pulling the legs apart inspecting the vagina. The female being had no breasts. It had five fingers and a thumb [6 digits] on each hand and [Reg Presley] says he counted six toes also (I could only see 5). The ears were smaller than ours and located lower on the head than ours, level with the mouth. The head was larger (especially behind) and the eyes were larger, at least as big as golf balls. It had a small nose and small mouth, which was open. The body was very muscle-bound with very short, stocky legs and larger human-looking feet. The belly was very large and looked 8 month's pregnant, which it was not. The ears had the same major spiral trough as ours but [were] smooth and featureless above, more simple and basic than ours. The surgeon cut from below the neck/chin down to the vagina and I believe a tee-line outwards across the lower stomach. The chest and stomach were exposed and the heart removed and placed into a tray with other substances from around that immediate area. The lungs were removed from behind into another tray. The cam- era was handheld, and would on occasion move in close, losing focus in so doing. The flesh and attachments to the organs being removed were moving and responding to those actions in a very convincing manner — as if real. There were small amounts of fluids running down the side of the body when the body was opened and or- gans removed. The colour of the liquid was dark and bloodlike. After the organs were cut out with a scalpel the sur- geon cut a continuous line around the middle of the head and I think over the top, and peeled back the skin from rear to front over the eyes, revealing the scalp. He took a saw and cut across the head and removed the brain with other material and placed it into another tray. Before the brain procedure started, the surgeon removed JUNE 1995 NUMBER 326 PAGE 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL a black lens layer from each eye, revealing white eyes just like ours under it. The eyes had pupils like ours which were looking up into the head (as a deceased human would). The single black layer of material was slightly disc-shaped to fit over the eye pupil. It was as if a filter lens/contact lens had been fitted into the eye. The right leg had a serious open wound, exposing the major bones from the lower part of the upper leg to middle calf area. The surgeon moved the leg, inspecting the joint. A large clock was on the wall to the side of the table and time I believe began at 10:30 and was seen again around 11:25. A wall-mounted telephone was visible, as were glass bottles and medical instruments. The body and procedures looked very authentic and in my opinion would have been hard to fake, but perhaps not impossible with current techniques. At the end of the film, the lights came on and with no comment people were expected to leave ... A large group gathered at the rear of the theatre around Ray Santilli, who was saying he will not answer questions and [that] the photographer is 80 odd [years old] and does not want the questions and exposure. No other questions were answered and he was whisked out with the media and myself staying with him. I asked him as we all crowded around him, \"Will you be seeing us in your office?\" He said, \"Yes, later.\" A TV interviewer said, \"How am I supposed to interview you without be- ing given access to any other material?\" When I was interviewed by BBC radio 1 outside, they told me that BBC TV had purchased a small amount of film and would be showing it next month. It is believed that a major U.S. media company has made a bid. \"ROSWELL DECLARATION\" AUTHOR KENT JEFFREY NIXES FILM Also present at the \"Roswell film\" showing was Kent Jeffrey, an American commercial airline pilot who wrote the \"Roswell Declaration\" and heads an interna- tional Roswell Initiative urging U.S. government dis- closure of the facts concerning the 1947 Roswell Incident. In a phone call to ISCNI president Michael Lindemann on Sunday, May 7, Jeffrey said that he was \"100 percent convinced that the film is a hoax.\" He said the dead body appeared to be that of a human, pos- sibly somewhat modified by prosthetics. Its musculature appeared well developed and very human. Overall the body appeared somewhat bloated. Its genitalia appeared female, though its chest had only small nipples. Jeffrey considers it possible that the makers of the film have vi- olated laws against mutilation of a corpse for entertain- ment. Possibly the best indication of hoax, he said, was that the telephone had a modern-looking coiled cord on the handset. Jeffrey said he intends to contact AT&T to find out if such coiled cords were in use as early as 1947. If not, the film is a proven fake. ISCNI will continue to follow this story as further in- formation becomes available.

The project will accomplish several important tasks: • Screen over 2000 newspapers from all over the world for UFO reports. • Search for UFO reports in libraries, historical soci- eties, universities, archives and other institutions in the US and Canada. • Gather records of first hand accounts from witnesses and search the files of UFO organizations and indi- vidual researchers for 1947 reports. • Compile the reports and data into the most compre- hensive study of the 1947 UFO Wave yet done. The written report will be available on the 50th anniversary of Kenneth Arnold's momentous sighting. Project 1947. with its primary focus on the year 1947, will also look forward as far as 1957 and back to 1900 for certain selected significant topics in UFO research. • The 1900-1946 period will be examined for UFO- like reports. • An effort will be made to locate the World War II Aircraft Warning Service records so that a search may be made for UFO reports in its files. • Ships' logs will be examined for UFO reports. • An attempt will be made to find the Ground Observer Corps (1951 -1957) filter centers' records in order to search for UFO reports.

The Circular File By Paul Rydeen (With thanks to Jeff Lewis and Joe Mason.) T he time has come to face facts. The complex patterns we know as crop circles can only come from human hands. It was natural to assume the first \"saucer nests\" were spontaneous formations. Their easy symmetry and sporadic appearance raised few eyebrows. Weather phe- nomena were an obvious culprit. Like first loves, crop circles are a summer affair. The second season saw the circles become something more than their namesake. Concentric circles, little knobby appurtenances and more adorned the central circle. It was easy to believe they were still a natural event. After all, much more complex designs are to be found else- where in nature. We began jumping through hoops to show this was so, looking for precedents in medieval lit- erature, UFO reports, and elsewhere. The anomaly of a new natural phenomenon was hard to accept for the or- thodox, but quite exciting to those seeking evidence of evolution natural or spiritual. As the circles became less circular and more com- plicated, it should have been obvious what their origin was. Instead we summoned aliens, Gaia, and \"Star Wars\" weaponry to explain the cascading ladders, bugs, fish, etc. that adorned England's fields. They were like veve diagrams from Haiti or the occult sigils of Eliphas Levi. They must mean something right? The obvious fakes were discarded, with no thought for the answer staring us in the face. Circles kept increasing in quantity, no doubt from a \"me too!\" attitude. A crop circle hoax- ing contest provided startling results as to how easy it re- ally was. When two men stepped forward and con- JUNE 1995 NUMBER 326 PAGE 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL fessed their crime, the mass media accepted their procla- mation and stopped giving the circles coverage. They immediately trailed off. but they do continue, spectacu- larly so last summer, according to some accounts. I am not debunking crop circles as hoaxes, though many surely are. Perhaps a prank at first, I see many as works of art, even as Rhorshach tests of our collective psyche. They are an interesting view into the minds of those who made them, and those who continue to believe at any cost. What the circles represent to me is a current of subconscious thought prevalent throughout our society at the time. We were manipulated because we were ready to be, because we wanted to be and needed to be. The cir- cle phenomenon grow only because we let it. We let it only because the time was right to do so. The artists, the hoaxers, the other unexplained circle-makers, all fed off this current, and in turn fed it by their continued crop cir- cle creation. If viewed as an experiment, the results are very interesting. We were set up, but by whom? To those who find significance in the geometry of cir- cles, I say that all geometry is significant, even sacred. Refer to the works of Pythagoras and the Neoplatonists if in doubt. The same geometry found in the Barbury Castle formation could be constructed on paper or in the design of a town square. Yes, it is significant, but it's not because it's a crop circle. I find the location of these circles as interesting as their shapes. Some circles appeared in field of rape. Rape is a flowering plant from which we get rapeseed oil, a common household product. \"Rape\" is also a highly-charged word, referring to abduction and sexual assault. Little Gray Men? Crop circles are also called \"corn circles\" in England, because they frequently ap- peared in fields of wheat and other cereal grains, referred to locally and collectively as corn. Corn is a powerful symbol, a symbol of magic and an- other world. Consider Stephen King's Children of the Corn, where horrible things take place in the corn, and the cornfield surrounding the old black woman's house in King's The Stand, where evil dwells. In Field of Dreams, the supernatural baseball players emerge from the corn at night, and return once their unearthly game is done. At the end of the story, the Ray Kinsella character played by Kevin Costner goes to see what's on the other side of the corn. With the first Planer of the Apes film, Arthur P. Jacobs turned a juvenile novelette into social commentary. We do live on a planet of the apes. Our animal nature rules. Reason loses out to emotion and instinct constantly. In one memorable scene, mounted gorillas chase humans through a cornfield, abduct them into slavery and worse. Those who can speak of the evil they have witnessed are operated upon, have their brains and their vocal cords cut out so they can no longer tell of the horror, cannot even remember it. A classic science fiction story called \"It's A Good Life\" was made into a Twilight Zone episode. It starred Billy Mumy of Lost In Space as a little boy with special powers. Anybody he thought did something wrong was immediately teleported to the cornfield, where creatures worse than those in The Stand resided. A corn deity was sacred to the Aztecs and the Mayans, both of whom practiced ritual sacrifice. To ensure a good crop, the Aztec high priest would have a special victim flayed alive. The priest would walk through the fields-wearing the still-warm hide of the sac- rifice. This was called \"skin-walking.\" \"Corn\" means \"horn\" in Latin, as in \"unicorn\" (one horn), \"cornucopia\" (horn of plenty), and \"cornet\" (mu- sical horn). There is a phallic meaning to \"horn,\" which ties in with the fields of rape imagery and the idea of skin-walking as a generative act. Our nourishment fol- lows from this act, a fact we choose to ignore to preserve our collective sanity. The same sentiment is echoed in the short story \"The Lottery,\" by Shirley Jackson, wherein a villager is selected by lottery each year for death by stoning. It is a sacrifice to hasten the harvest and increase the yield. Perhaps the oldest reference to corn is that of Tammuz, the Babylonian corn deity. He was dismem- bered as a sacrifice, .serving as a model for Osiris. Orpheus, and others. His mourners would walk the streets and wail at the appropriate time of year. The symbolic placement of corn circles is as impor- tant as their shape, even more so. Despite the fact that it provides us with sustenance, the cornfield does not seem to be a pleasant place. A price must be paid to feed the community. This is the message of the circles — not of the circle-makers, but of the current which inspires their creative effort. We are being manipulated, but to- wards what end? 1995 UFO SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS The MUFON 1995 International UFO Symposium Proceedings will be available by mail on July 1, 1995 from MUFON in Seguin, Texas.

PAGE 16 NUMBER 326 JUNE 1995"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Letters to Mufon UFO Journal GRACE, INDEED!. While Ms. Puhalski (\"Fall From Grace,\" April. 1995) was compassionately considering the effects of a frame- up on the many Bassett victims she might have given some thought to how I would be affected by having my name in print without benefit of prior notice, left sus- pended in innuendo as well as misspelled. Except for its self-aggrandizement, it is pointless reference in a point- less article and MUFON was mindless to print it. — Diana DeSimone Newton, MA MORE ON THE FALL As someone who has chosen to maintain a very low pro- file in the UFO field, I was surprised to learn that my name had appeared in the article, \"Fall from Grace.\" by Roberta Puhalski (April, 1995). After reading it, I thought carefully about whether or not to write to correct some possible wrong impres- sions. I have decided to go ahead because there are larger issues involved in what Ms. Puhalski has to say. First, there is the seemingly minor but important point of advance notice — the Journal not having sent an advance copy of the article to me for possible com- ment. I believe Diana DeSimone is very upset about this in her own case as are a number of other Massachusetts MUFON members. She is justifiably much more dis- turbed than I because of the statements made about her, namely, \"government agent,\" \"sudden monetary in- crease,\" etc. Diana did receive an advance copy, but only after the Journal had been printed. The second issue is that of Ms. Puhalski citing the Malacarias without independently checking with the people named — I and Diana having never met or heard from Ms. Puhalski. A third issue I would like to address and counter is the possible impression Ms. Puhalski has given that Massachusetts MUFON was in some way taken in by the Bassetts' claims. To do that I will have to tell you a little more about my own involvement with them. The Bassetts first attended a local MUFON meeting in the spring of 1992. Martha Munroe tells me I was there but didn't meet them. They made some of their claims to Martha at that time and she invited them and me to her home on June 2, 1992 to talk about these claims as a precursor to a possible investigation using re- gression. Two cassette tapes were filled with our con- versation. This is normal procedure for cases where there are exotic claims and no evidence — all too typi- cal for latent encounters. What stood out very pointedly was that this couple appeared highly paranoid with a government agent seemingly under everyone's bed. I said as much to them but they weren't upset. Their irra- tionality on the issue of conspiracy, plus the unprovable nature of Donna's claims, made me plead \"lack of time\" to avoid working with them. But, as we had done with the Malacarias, after trying to gauge their earlier claims, we invited Donna and Ed to our next experiencer meet- ing which was to be held five days later (June 7). The meeting of June 7, 1992, referred to in the article, was not a MUFON group in any sense. (Nancy Malacaria ac- knowledges that I had told her this before and I will write more about these meetings below). Since I am a MUFON member and had looked into some of the Malacarials claims in that capacity, they apparently con- sidered anything that I did that was related to UFOs as MUFON activity. Ms. Puhalski evidently picked that up from Nancy's notes but didn't check the matter out. It was at that meeting that Donna, with emotion, told a story about her fingers being burned and then restored miraculously by an alien. The Bassetts attended a few more MUFON meet- ings but had by now apparently gravitated toward others. As far as Donna's and Ed's claims went, no one in MU- FON paid them any attention, so, I conjecture, they sought other ears. I said very little to Ed and nothing to Donna at these meetings. I didn't know what they were up to and really didn't care. After thirty years in a field where I had listened to legions of unsupported claims, those of the Bassetts were nothing to get excited about, and since I don't sensationally write about claims, I'm sure they weren't excited about me either. On October 4, 1992, Ed Bassett phoned to tell me that he was in legal trouble and that he was afraid that the claims I had recorded would be somehow made public, prejudicing his case. He offered to transcribe the tapes if I would send him the originals. I neither believed his story about legal troubles nor his promise to transcribe the tapes, but 1 didn't mind complying with his wishes since I found the whole thing transparent and almost amusing — it was obvious he didn't want to leave a trail. I did not make tape copies and sent out the origi- nals on October 5th. I didn't expect that Ed would ever send me transcripts and, of course, he never has. Other than strengthening the negative opinion of the Bassetts, the points of this little relation are twofold: 1) Massachusetts MUFON was suspicious of them long be- fore they surfaced in the media. We treated them as any people with extraordinary claims should be treated; if there's no evidence, take notes and don't get excited. 2) Public proponents of controversial subjects should be as conservative as possible. Although this letter is getting quite long I feel I want to make a comment on experiencer groups, since Ms. Puhalski seems to be disillusioned about what she has found. I have moderated, and Martha Munroe has hosted, aperiodic meetings ( 2 or 3 times per year) of an expe- riencer support group which has met in Massachusetts JUNE 1995 NUMBER 326 PAGE 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL since 1987. At first the group was restricted to those peo- ple with whom Martha and I were working to uncover latent encounter images. Later the group was opened to anyone who believed he/she had had an encounter ex- perience and who wished to share thoughts and feelings with others claiming similar things. Mental health pro- fessionals (mhp's) who expressed an interest to us were also invited. At least one experienced mhp was always present for these meetings. We have always refrained from attracting public attention. To return to Ms. Puhalski's article, although she writes in general that \"...some abductees began to desert these 'safe havens.' Other abductees even turned against the researcher/facilitators who first.brought them to- gether,\" it seems she is really only talking about Ed and Donna Basselt — or does she have other instances? Experiencer support groups are a means to an end not an end in themselves. They are meant to serve as a tem- porary haven for those who are exploring their experi- ences and coming to tenns with them, not a perpetual crutch. Support groups are meant to be fluid. Only those who still truly need the meetings come. Over the years we have had minor problems, such as complaints about solicitations from within to join another group and about attendees who bring in a special viewpoint, like religion or the lack of it. One of the problems in these support groups is how people view themselves. The term \"abductee\" is a vic- timizing term and I gather from what you write that people you have worked with view themselves that way. We have adopted the term \"experiencer\" as one that does not prejudge the nature of a person's experiences. And, to further that atmosphere of non-judgement, there are no preparing or concluding statements that cue the group attendees about how they are supposed to view themselves and the phenomenon. That viewpoint is only arrived at on a personal level during the bringing-to- mind of encounter images in regression. The group meetings are limited to discussion of thoughts, feelings, and to the comparison of individual experiences. Usually there is an agenda of issues se- lected by experiences at the start of a meeting. There are no preconditions other than confidentiality and that at- tendees believe they have had some kind of anomalous experience that is UFO related. Telephone numbers can be exchanged by mutual agreement. Speaking for myself, confidentiality is a primary is- sue! I don't ask attendees to go public with their story! I refuse any media requests for public appearances! I am not writing mass market books! I am happy to say that there are very few \"victims\" in our group, although a number have arrived that way after exposure to TV, books and conferences. In bringing their encounter im- ages to mind they have arrived at a different viewpoint, on their own, and without being led. In cases of individuals newly entering investigation, perhaps feeling beset by fears and doubts, there are oth- ers available for counsel who have worked through their negativity and fear and are willing to act as indi- vidual support for the newly arrived. If Ms. Puhalski would like to continue discussion of support groups I would be happy to do so. — Joe Nyman Medfield. MA The Journal greatly regrets any offended sensibilities or hurt feelings occasioned by the publication of Ms. Pulhaski's article, especially on the part of Ms. DeSimone. While it is a courtesy, not an absolute re- quirement, for any author to share what they write with those mentioned or quoted, the timely publication of a monthly journal does not always permit such counesies. ' It was known to the editors of this journal, for in- stance, that Dr. John Mack was under scrutiny by a committee of his Han'ard colleagues, based in the main on his promotion of the abduction phenomenon. Indeed, a feature article regarding same appeared in The New York Times for Thursday, May 4, 1995 (\"Professor Writing of Aliens is Under Inquiry at Harvard\"). As readers should know, part of Dr. Mack's problems stem from the infiltration of his support group by Donna and Ed Bassett, whose subsequent activities raise serious ethical questions. Since Ms. Pulhaski's article deals in part with these activities, we thought readers would find her article extremely timelv. In short, it is the Bassetts and their behavior who are under scrutiny here, and it is the Bassetts, not MUFON or any of its members, who voiced rumors about Ms. DeSimone be- ing a government agent, etc. The Bassetts are said to be writing a book about their experiences with Massachusetts MUFON and Dr. Mack. If you think you may be mentioned therein, please let us know if they extend you the courtesy of an advance copy for comment prior to publication. And remember: they had all the time in the world. MAGNUM OPUS In your April issue John Carpenter did a nice job in his column, \"Update on Professional Support,\" of saluting the efforts of various groups around the country that are trying to reach out and support people that believe they are experiencing paranormal phenomenon. It is so im- portant that groups like MUFON, OPUS (Organization for Paranormal Understanding and Support), PEER, the group in El Paso headed by Dr. Joe Lewels. and other in- dividuals who are interested, network as much as pos- sible in order to help one another help those people in need. John's article goes a long way in helping the net- working process and for that, thank you! I would also like to add a few notes of clarification re- garding OPUS, which was actually co-founded by Dr. Eugene Lipson, a longtime member of MUFON, and myself, a field investigator and past training coordinator for MUFON in northern California.

When I completed the Roswell in Perspective manu- script in March 1994, the information I had concerning specific Mogul flights was in many respects sketchy and in some parts erroneous. At the time, Flight 9, launched on the evening of July 3. 1947, seemed the most likely source of the debris W. W. Brazel found on the Foster Ranch. Now, with considerably more infor- mation in hand, for essentially the same reasons outlined by Randle (see \"MUFON Forum,\" Journal 323, p. 19). and based on hard evidence, I agree with Randle that Flight 9 could not have been the culprit. On the other hand, substantial evidence, including important weather data obtained by Randle, strongly suggests Brazel's find was debris from Mogul Flight 4, launched on June 4, 1947. Professor C. B. Moore, who served as the Mogul project engineer, has recently completed a white paper, \"The New York University [Army Air Force Project Mogul contractor] Balloon Flights During Early June, 1947,\" setting forth his analysis of the data and his own firsthand recollections. Therein (p. 4) he explains why Flight 4 almost certainly was a \"full-scale cluster [a flight train more than 450 feet high], complete with the targets for tracking by the Watson Lab radar,\" and re- calls \"J. R. Smith watching the June 4th cluster through a theodolite\" and \"Capt. Dyvad reporting] that the ... radar had lost the targets while Smith had them in view.\" He also recalls that the flight was tracked from the air by the crew of a B-17G assigned to the project who \"terminated their chase, while the balloons were Continued on Page 23 RED LION HOTEL SEATAC 18740 Pacific Highway South, Seattle, WA 98188 Location: Adjacent to SeaTac International Airport, one mile from 1-5, 20 minutes south of downtown Seattle.

Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus (-3.9) rises about 4 AM in the NE and stays quite low in the E at dawn. The brilliant world can be seen near the cres- cent Moon on June 26. Jupiter doesn't set until sunrise early in the month. It begins to set earlier after that. Look for it only 2° S of the full moon on the 12th. Saturn ( 1 .2), in Aquarius, now rises about I AM (midmonth) in the E. The ringed planet stands in the SE at dawn. Moon Phases: First quarter — June 6 Full moon — June 1 3 Last quarter — June 19 New moon — June 27 The Stars: The celestial meridian divides the night sky into springtime stars in the W (Leo, Bootes, Virgo) and summer stars in the E. That welcome sky symbol of the season, the Summer Triangle, is now fully visible in the E after evening twilight ends. Scorpius. with its red heart Antares and winding tail (complete with a stinger on the end), begins its seasonal foray across the southern horizon. Jupiter lies above Antares. Almost overhead is Hercules with his four-sided \"Keystone.\" Below him stands Ophiuchus the Serpent Bearer, shaped much like a big Arab tent. In the NW the Big Dipper starts its downward arc in the sky, and the hard-to-see sprawling outline of Draco the Dragon coils between the Big and Little Dippers and Hercules. Sky watchers will find the monthly star maps in the MU- FON Field Investigator's Manual helpful.

Cobb, M.S. (Dallas, TX) in Library Science. NATIONAL UFO AWARENESS WEEK Virginia Tilly, Public Education Director, has an- nounced that National UFO Awareness Week is sched- uled for August 12 through 20, 1995. Start planning your exhibits and arrange for display locations now. RESEARCH PROPOSALS The Mutual UFO Network has joined with the Center for UFO Studies and the Fund for UFO Research in a coalition that will solicit for research proposals. The members of the coalition council will pass judgment on the proposals submitted and then fund worthy projects with monetary grants. The objective of all three groups is to move the study of UFOs more toward science us- ing the general protocols of the scientific method. Scientific research projects will receive highest priority, followed by public education projects, and then fol- lowed by general special projects. This is an opportunity for scientists, engineers, and academics to explore ideas, theories, and studies that could lead to the resolution of the UFO enigma. Proposal forms may be secured by writing to any of the three above named organizations or to Thomas P. Deuley, 103 Oldtowne Road, Seguin, TX 78155-4099. NEW FIELD INVESTIGATOR'S MANUAL The much awaited fourth edition of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual is now available for shipment. It is nearly a complete revision, with an entirely new for- mat, compared to the third edition which had been ac- cepted as the standard manual in the English-speaking nations. It is composed of 24 sections, some having several part numbers, and authored by a vast contingent of outstanding UFO researchers and investigators. The 311-page manual is being delivered in a 3-ring loose leaf hardback notebook. Edited by Walter H. Andrus, Jr., the manual is re- spectfully dedicated to Jerold R. \"Ron\" Johnson and Dan C. Overlade, Ph.D., for not only their personal contributions to the manual, but their individual dedi- cation to resolving the UFO phenomenon. Due to the manual's size and weight, special mailing envelopes were purchased for shipping. The price to MUFON members has been set at $25 plus $3.50 for postage and handling, whereas non-current members may obtain the new manual for $35 plus $3.50 for p. and h. The same prices will apply in foreign countries. MUFON FORUM - Continued from Page 13 still airborne ... in the vicinity of Capitan Peak, about 23 miles south-southeast of the Foster Ranch. Moore concludes (p. 11), \"When the wind information is cou- pled with the similarities in the debris described by the eyewitnesses ... to the materials used in our balloon flight trains, it appears to me that it would be difficult to exclude NYU Flight #4 as a likely source of the de- bris that W. W. Brazel found.\" I hope Professor Moore's paper will be available generally in the near future (Moore is in the process of making some revisions), and I congratulate Kevin Randle for his initiative in collecting the important weather information which has contributed so signifi- cantly to Moore's analysis and to our growing under- standing of what really happened near Roswell so long ago. — Karl T.

Packard 1948-1995 Patrick J. \"Pat\" Packard (Hamilton, Ohio), Assistant State Director for Southwestern Ohio, State Section Director, and Field Investigator, passed away on June 3, 1995 after a brief illness while hospitalized. Bill Jones, Ohio State Director, had this to say in memory of Pat. \"Pat was probably the hardest working MUFON member in Ohio. He organized a fine group in the Cincinnati area, produced a periodic public television show that was viewed around the state, and truly became an expert on the Roswell case. He will be missed by me and the rest of those he worked with to help increase the human race's knowl- edge of the UFO phenomenon. The discipline of ufology is less because of Pat's passing.\" UFOs, MJ-12 AND THE GOVERNMENT: A Report on Government Involvement in the UFO Crash Retrievals (113 pages) by Grant Cameron and T.

MUFON AMATEUR RADIO NET The MUFON-sponsored forty meter net continues to meet every Saturday morning at 8 a.m. (EST or EDT) on 7.237 MHz to pass traffic concerning UFOs and re- lated phenomena. Despite current poor conditions and foreign broadcast interference heard in some parts of the country, many stations who have checked into the net regularly for years continue to do so. They are joined by numerous operators whose interest or license upgrades are more recent. There is also a contingent of short wave listeners with receivers capable of single side- band (SSB) reception who listen and contribute infor- mation by correspondence. They find the reports of cur- rent activity and upcoming media events in various parts of the country exciting. Robert Schultz, WOAXK, St. Paul, MN, is now act- ing as primary net control operator. He is assisted by James Cormia. WB2GAJ, from Ilion, NY. David Dobbs, AA8DK, who handled the net from the Cincinnati area for many years commends them for their dedication, and continues to help as needed. NEW OFFICERS When Shirley A. Tafoya resigned as Michigan State Director, she recommended that William J. and Linda C. Murphy be appointed Co-State Directors for Michigan, which has since been approved.
