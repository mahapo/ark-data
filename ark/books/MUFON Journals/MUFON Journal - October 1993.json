A Special Exclusive Report by Bryan Gresh N o meeting was ever complete without food. Whether tea and \"special occasion\" cookies offered by a government biologist who stud- ies reported UFO landing sites, or the homemade cab- bage pie served by a retired Red Army colonel who ran an unprecedented ten year study of UFOs in the former Soviet Union, we never left an interview hun- gry. Our Russian hosts were warm, sincere, friendly and, despite fixed incomes that amounted to little more than 25 or 30 US dollars a month, happy to share a meal with their American visitors. They also shared with us the secrets of decades of study into the UFO phenomenon in the vast Soviet empire. During our 10-day Russian stay in March of this year, colleague George Knapp and I met, and conduct- ed lengthy interviews with, a previously hidden eche- lon of researchers and scientists, dedicated profession- als who had pursued their interest in UFOs during the long, dark reign of the Communists. Their findings were not known to the outside world—until now. Among our contacts: one of the architects of the Russian \"Star Wars\" program who emphatically claims the exchange of information between aliens and humans was incorporated in Russian \"beam weapon\" technology; a Moscow professor who has spent 30 years studying reported UFO landing sites, including many in and around Moscow; a Russian sci- entist with first-hand knowledge of the reported crash of a UFO near Roswell, New Mexico in 1947; a quiet, shadowy figure who heads the ongoing Ministry of Defense studies into UFOs; and an author and scien- tist who became, in essence, a non-person for talking publicly about the UFO phenomenon. The trip to Russia took seven months to set up and was arranged by our man in Moscow. Nikolai Kapranov. Kapranov is a Russian physicist who served as Security Advisor to the Soviet Parliament. We met Kapranov during a lecture tour of the United States. The UFO subject, it seems, had been talked about for years among Kapranov's circle of friends and associates, including scientists, military officers and KGB operatives. We set Kapranov up in Moscow with an office and a salary and asked him to see what hard information he could find. What we had hoped, as odd as it sounds, was to find out a little of what America knows about UFOs by talking to the Russians. It has long been assumed if the US government were secretly monitoring UFOs, the same might be going on in the Soviet Union. If the American government had been stockpiling this infor- mation under the national security blanket, maybe the Russians had been doing the same. We all know how little our government has made public on the subject, but this was a new day in Russia. The new freedoms the Russians were experiencing might extend to the subject of UFOs. Maybe the veil of secrecy would be lifted, if only to offer a peek. But it wasn't going to be easy. When we stepped off the plane at Moscow's airport on that bone-chilling, late winter evening, the New Russia's ongoing political turmoil was as much on our minds as the UFO research we had come to do. The emerging democracy in this post-Communist era had spawned tension and upheaval. During our stay, loud, angry demonstrations were a daily occurrence. It seemed as if with each passing day, Russian President Boris Yeltsin was that much closer to being ousted. On our last day in Moscow, the Russian Parliament was meeting to consider impeachment (a process which, unlike in the United States, could take all of five minutes). Russian Army tanks rolled through the streets, trucks filled with troops convoyed near Red Square. Despite not knowing how, or when, our visit would end, the window of opportunity was open—and the lure was too great. S tories on UFOs from inside the Soviet Union have filtered out for years. Thanks to the work of Dr. Richard Haines, Jacques Vallee, Bruce Maccabee, Paul Stonehill and others, solid indications have sur- faced of long-term, large scale UFO studies. Our goal was to talk, face to face, with those who were in the know, knowledgeable individuals who had not been quoted in the Western press before, or even the Russian press for that matter. For the record, we have nothing against the Russian ufologists who are already known in the West. We were simply looking for a new layer of information and, hopefully, a treasure trove of UFO secrets. One of the bigger gems was Boris Sokolov, a retired Russian colonel from a distinguished military family. Sokolov ran an unprecedented study, the likes of which, he is undoubtedly correct in saying, will never be repeated. \"For 10 years,\" Sokolov says, \"the entire Soviet Union became one gigantic UFO listen- ing post.\" The year was 1980. An amazing order came down from the Ministry of Defense: Every military unit in the vast Soviet empire was to report any and all UFO sightings. Pilots, soldiers and sailors were ordered to OCTOBER 1993 NUMBER 306 PAGE 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Is the UFO phenomenon for real, we asked. \"My colleagues and I don't even think that's a question!\" Rimili Avramenko bellowed. \"Of course they are real!\" observe the behavior of the craft, and, if possible, take pictures. Later they would provide full and detailed statements to investigators. All reports would make their way up the military ladder, and land in the lap of Sokolov. The reports were numerous, the findings never before made public. \"We had 40 cases where our pilots encountered UFOs,\" said Sokolov. \"Initially, they were command- ed to chase, then shoot, the UFO. But when our pilots would engage, the UFO would speed up. The pilot would give chase, lose control and crash.\" That happened three times. Twice, the pilots died. \"After that,\" Sokolov said, \"the pilots received anoth- er order: When they see a UFO they should change course — and get out.\" The pilots reported the UFO seemed to possess an extraordinary intelligence, enough to know how far to push the pursuing Soviet aircraft to the point the pilot would lose control. The pilots viewed the UFO as a definite threat. With the exception of the original \"engage\" order, Sokolov says the Soviets adopted a passive observa- tion stance — if they saw a UFO. fine. The Soviet attitude was unlike the Americans, Sokolov says, who had set up some 30 radar stations to track UFOs. S okolov says the military was interested in UFOs for a number of reasons, including the belief if the secrets of the UFO could be discovered, the Soviets would be able to win the competition against prospective enemies by incorporating what extrater- restrials knew of velocity, materials — and stealth. Sokolov told us the search for stealth technology was prompted by the capabilities of UFOs. October 5, 1983 is a date Sokolov will long remem- ber. He received an order from his commander to leave immediately for an ICBM base in the Ukraine. The rea- son for the urgency? A report from the base commander to the Chief of the General Staff that the day before, from 4 until 8 that evening, a UFO had been observed near the base. During that time, the lights had lit up on the base control panel — the launch codes for the ICBM's had, mysteriously, been enabled. \"They received an order to prepare the launch of the ICBM's,\" said Sokolov. \"The chief of the General Staff wasted no time in sending in our UFO experts.\" Fortunately, no missiles were launched. But in an article six years later in an issue of the magazine Soviet Military Review, Soviet military leaders made a strong case for exchanging UFO information, on a regular basis, with the West. It was suggested if the two sides did not communicate on this issue, a UFO might someday trigger a nuclear exchange between the superpowers. The Soviet authors admitted UFOs were tracked by Soviet defense systems and suggested the same must be true in the United States. Sokolov reports a number of cases involved mili- tary sentinels stationed through the Soviet Union who shot at approaching UFOs. He says when the guards started shooting, the UFO would take off. Thousands of cases came to Sokolov during the 1980's. From his voluminous files, he's compiled the 400 most intriguing cases. Amazingly, we were allowed to purchase the entire file, and are now in the process of having the documents translated. From the archives. Sokolov says, it can be determined that an overwhelming number of the military sightings can be explained in conventional terms. Still, many remain a mystery. Says Sokolov. \"It's a phenomena that cannot be explained away so far.\" Sokolov is quick to point out that, during the entire length of the study, not one piece of material evidence was left behind. However, Sokolov is aware of one piece of recovered, although unidentified, material which has been sent to four different Russian insti- tutes for analysis. All four centers agree, the elements which form the material cannot be combined on earth. PAGE 4 NUMBER 306 OCTOBER 1993"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Though a modest man, Sokolov admits no one else in the former Soviet Union has more information on UFOs than himself. As for the aging colonel, he is quite certain the UFO phenomenon is for real, and is convinced we will someday find the physical evidence to prove it. \"Our world is not unique,\" he says, \"it can be imagined.\" R imili Avramenko's world is somewhat unique. He is one of the chief scientists working on Russia's version of SDI. Avramenko has been entrusted with the highest possible clearances. So high that, for much of his life, he hasn't been able to use his real name. If he wanted to publish something, he would have to use an alias. We began our interview of this highly-regarded scientist with what we thought would be a good ice- breaker: Is the UFO phenomenon for real? The question was quickly brushed aside, in no uncertain terms. \"My colleagues and I don't even think that's a question!\" he bellowed. \"Of course they are real!\" The exchange of information between aliens and humans, the scientist claims, has led to the develop- ment of what he referred to as the \"weapon of the aliens,\" the plasma beam. The space age weaponry was incorporated into the Soviet version of SDI. Dr. Avramenko also confirmed for us that Russians knew UFOs were from somewhere else as early as 1959. The Americans knew that too, he said, because both sides had the same type of satellite defense warning systems. Dr. Avramenko shared with us a couple of other startling pronouncements: during the Vietnam War, he said, a massive UFO flew over Hanoi. Although every major weapon in that city had its sights set on the craft, it didn't budge. Dr. Avramenko also slipped up and told us the only craft which can approach the speed of UFO is the American \"Aurora\" which is being flown in Nevada. When the look of amazement registered on our faces, Avramenko quickly back- tracked and said his information was based solely on articles in the popular press. Both Sokolov and Avramenko admitted to us mili- tary studies of UFOs are still underway in Russia. Some of the still-classified documents we were able to get out of Russia bear that out. The documents make it clear the Russian military maintains an ongoing, high level interest in the UFO subject. The documents reveal the Russians are far beyond the \"Are they real?\" question. They not only know they're real, the Russians are trying to find out how to take advantage, technologically, of that fact. The documents also show the Russians are monitoring ufology on a worldwide basis. We have found references to MJ-12. Still other American references in the files have never been made public in the West. Another of our meetings put us across the table from the Ministry of Defense official who is in charge Another of our meetings put us across the table from the Ministry of Defense official who is in charge of the current UFO study. By agreement, we are not yet able to make his name public, but we can give the name of the study, \"Thread-3.\" of the current study. By agreement, we are not yet able to make his name public, but we can give the name of the study, \"Thread-3.\" One illuminating section of those papers contains details of UFO sightings by Soviet cosmonauts. Unlike American astronauts' reluctance to talk about the subject, UFO references were reported from the very beginning, with Yuri Gagarin himself. In the documents, Gagarin is quoted as saying UFOs are real, they fly at incredible speeds and that he would tell more about what he had seen in orbit—provided he be given permission to do so. The documents also provide information on American space encounters, including several references to things seen on the moon by our astronauts, and how that information was removed from NASA's public files. What do the Russians know about the most cele- brated of all UFO crashes, the July, 1947 report of a crashed disc outside Roswell, New Mexico? If the incident were \"real,\" the Russians should have known about it. After all, atomic bomb research was going on in the New Mexican desert at the time. Could Russian spies be far away? Our next interview made it seem apparent that, even in the 40's, the Russians weren't buying the weather balloon explanation being prof- fered to the American people at the time by the US military. That interview was with Valeriy Burdakov, a man who, to my knowledge, has never granted an inter- view to a Western journalist. In the 1950's, Burdakov was a scientist at the prestigious Moscow Aviation Institute, birthplace of the Soviet space program. Burdakov's interest in UFOs led to lecturing on the subject, lectures which came to the attention of Sergei Korolyov, the dean of Soviet rocketry and the founder of the Russian space program. But Korolyov did not admonish the younger Burdakov, instead he confided in him. A s the now-60-something Burdakov relates, Joseph Stalin invited Korolyov to a meeting in 1948. The dictator brought Korolyov to a room where, spread out on a table, were piles of material and information col- lected during a top secret study. Some of the information was gleaned from reports of Soviet operatives in place in New Mexico at the time of the alleged crash. Stalin was anxious to know, what did Korolyov make of this reported crash of a UFO near Roswell? OCTOBER 1993 NUMBER 306 PAGE 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL \"Korolyov said. 'O.K., I'll collect the materials and bring them back in two days,'\" said Burdakov. \"But Stalin told him, 'No, you can't take any of this.'\" Burdakov says Stalin instead ordered Korolyov to work in the room for as long as he needed. Stalin offered to supply translators and anything else Korolyov needed to get the job done. When he fin- ished, Stalin asked Korolyov for his opinion. \"Korolyov told Stalin the phenomenon was real,\" said Burdakov. ''He told him the UFOs were not dan- gerous to our country, but they were not manufactured in the United States, or any other country. Stalin thanked him, and told Korolyov his opinion was shared by a number of other specialists.\" Our interview with Burdakov revealed other first hand accounts from the annals of Soviet ufology. Burdakov says the founding father of the Soviet UFO movement, Felix Zigel, was asked to lecture the KGB on the UFO phenomenon. Burdakov says he, too, found himself on the secret speaking tour, appearing before the Atomic Energy Institute and other \"closed secret insti- tutes\" to share what he knew about UFOs. Burdakov says he was guaranteed his lectures would be kept quiet. Burdakov says he has no doubts about the extent of the American government's involvement in the UFO phenomenon. Several branches of the American military, he says, are involved in active research and study. \"We know that the United States Air Force possesses plenty of material.\" says Burdakov. \"The U.S. Navy has a big amount of material as well. We know that special orders have been given to keep all materials se- cret. When curious people ask for the materials they are told they're not there, that they've been destroyed.\" The study of UFOs in the Soviet Union didn't always enjoy an unobstructed field of view. Several times, Soviet ufologists found themselves on the outs with the Soviet hierarchy. Even before Zigel, there was Yuri Fomin. Fomin's interest in UFO dates back to the early 50's while connected with a Moscow institute working on in- dustrial/electronic techniques. During lectures he de- livered to the Soviet military, he became intrigued by the number of audience members who were witnesses to UFO events. His interest, though, was not something the Soviet system thought he should publicly share. Whether out of jealousy or fear, the Soviets ordered Fomin to put a lid on it. Despite a very public attack in Pravda, Fomin refused. It cost him. Fomin would become a non-person for talking openly about the subject. Still, he would not give up. During those dark days, Soviet ufol- ogy was driven underground. Yet despite public censure, Fomin and Zigel were asked to deliver classified lectures to government and military officials on the very subject they were being persecuted for talking about publicly. The Academy of Sciences has undertaken continu- al, private studies of UFOs since the 1970's. Over the years, as many as ten different institutions have been Most American scientists will tell you the UFO phenomenon doesn't exist because they don't have any evidence to study. No evidence equals no study. The Russians, apparently, haven't heard that equation. They've been conducting field studies for a quarter of a century. involved in the studies, resulting in thousands of case files. The Russians, of course, have their skeptics, but even their skepticism offers a refreshing change to what Americans face. The Academy's Institute of Terrestrial Magnetism houses the country's best known skeptic, Yuri Platov. Yes, Platov says, 90% of Russian UFO sightings are misidentifications of rock- et launches, planes and the like, but even a skeptical Platov admits some cases cannot be easily dismissed. Science, he says, should be interested in pursuing the unexplained, without the baggage of preconceived notions. Platov does not rule out the possibility of extraterrestrial visitations. M ost American scientists will tell you the UFO phenomenon doesn't exist because they don't have any evidence to study. No evidence equals no study. The Russians, apparently, haven't heard that equation. They've been conducting field studies for a quarter of a century. Rem Varlamov of the Moscow Technology Institute believes evidence abounds. We met with Dr. Varlamov at his small apartment outside Moscow for an in-depth interview. Dr. Varlamov has traveled to a number of reported UFO landing sites in Russia, including ten in the direct vicinity of Moscow, to conduct a variety of tests on physical and chemical changes in the soil and the environment. Among his voluminous findings: Identical quartz timepieces, one placed inside a land- ing site, the other just outside, record time at two dif- ferent speeds. The quartz timepiece inside the landing circle speeds up. Dr. Varlamov has also discovered that inside the reported landing site circles the land is all but sterile, yielding just a few individual samples of single-celled animals per cubic centimeter of soil. Just outside the circles, tens of thousands of single cell animals flourish in every cubic centimeter. Varlamov told us the main thrust of his work is not to contact \"the space intellect,\" but, rather, to understand how the universe works. Among his other fascinating findings: evidence of what is known as \"angel hair,\" a type of by-product of UFO exhaust. Varlamov has ob- tained a sample to analyze the content. Dr. Varlamov also claims at least six attempts have been made to make pre-arranged contact with alien intelligence. Some of these contacts, he claims, were successful. Varlamov's findings are supported by a government biologist and close colleague. His name is Yuri PAGE 6 NUMBER 306 OCTOBER 1993"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Simakov. Simakov has not been known outside of Russia until now. Dr. Simakov has also traveled to a number of Russian landing site cases, gathering data and conducting numerous tests. One of those experi- ments involved flies. \"We placed flies in a dish and put the dish over a landing site,\" Dr. Simakov said. \"The flies went wild, buzzing and flying around.\" Most intriguing, however, was Simakov's discovery of tiny, glass-like balls recovered from soil inside the landing site circles. Russian scientists, as yet, have not been able to identify these microscopic marbles. Simakov has a couple of theories. \"They may be formed as the result of transmuta- tion,\" he said, \"when oxygen was transformed into sodium under the influence of the UFO.\" Or, he says, they may be containers to carry life from one planet to another. Although Dr. Simakov did not have many of these \"seeds,\" he did give us some, in hopes American sci- entists might be able to solve the mystery. A highly reputable lab in the United States has analyzed the material. We are not yet in receipt of the written report, but this much is known: a team of experts which tested and analyzed the little balls has absolute- ly no idea what they are. These folks are experts in plant pathology and micro organisms, they suggested we next contact a chemist. They say the material appears to be similar to glass in composition, and someone familiar with how glass forms in soil may provide some insight. Another of Dr. Simakov's discoveries comes from two reported landing sites in Siberia. Simakov found microscopic worms in the soil. Nothing too unusual there, except these worms are particular to Mexico, and don't occur naturally anywhere in the former Soviet Union. A sizable portion of our time in Moscow was spent with a military official whose area of expertise may offend the sensibilities of mainstream American ufologists. His research has a distinct, New Age fla- vor. Though at first glance, it may be easy to dismiss this work as so much mumbo jumbo, it is important to re- member who is behind it: the Russian military machine. Also important to remember: it is a subject taken very seriously. Again, because of an agreement to protect his identity, we cannot divulge his name. However, he is no lightweight. His boss reports directly to the Russian version of Colin Powell. In the West, it would be called a \"remote viewing\" program, the ability to \"see\"' classified materials locked away in a safe thousands of miles away. But for the general in charge of this program, it entails much more. We were shown films which detailed the training of Russian soldiers. At the completion of the program, these soldiers would be able to track military targets without the benefit of any equipment. No radar, no satellites, no night vision glasses—just their minds. We were told the success rate hovered around 70%. Some of what the general is working on has already been put to use by Russian law enforcement. For the general and his staff, the connection with UFOs is one of communication. Several times during our trip, we heard reference to the \"universal brain\" and the \"cosmic intellect.\" These disciples of ufology believe it is possible to communicate with alien intel- ligence on an ongoing basis. Not just \"grays,\" but dimensional, spatial beings that live with, and around, us on Earth. Yes, it's \"out there\"—but no one snickers when the subject is talked about it. T he study of UFOs in Russia is huge, serious and on- going. All the secrets cannot be found out in one trip. Fortunately, we have been invited back to Russia to continue our investigation behind what was once an iron curtain. The Ministry of Defense has invited us to take part in a UFO safari to study a high concentration sighting area in Siberia. We would be not only the only Westerners, but the only reporters. Unfortunately, the trip had to be cancelled for this year, because of a lack of Ministry of Defense funding. Hopefully, we'll make the trip next year. In the meantime, our company is in the process of putting together a series of videotaped documentaries on the \"Best Evidence\"— both in the US. Russia and around the world. The first tapes should be available in early 1994. Perhaps the \"new\" Russia will bring new opportu- nities for American and Russian UFO researchers to compare notes, and exchange vital information gath- ered from opposite sides of the world. To that end. our company has signed an agreement with the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences to establish a joint American-Russian research institute to foster the exchange of information between both sides. The UFO phenomenon is, after all, a subject too important to be left solely up to governments. Bryan Gresh is Senior Vice President of Altamira Communications Group. He spent 15 years as a television news reporter in a number of markets around the country. Before joining Altamira in January of 1992, Bryan was an anchor/reporter at the CBS affiliate in Las Vegas, KLAS-TV. It was while in Las Vegas that he began working with renowned UFO researcher, George Knapp. Knapp and Gresh have teamed up to produce a series of videotape documentaries on the UFO phenomenon, the first of which will be available later this year.

George Knapp, the Las Vegas television reporter who gave a great deal of air time to the Bob Lazar story and Gene Huff, a close associate of Lazar, were unable at the last minute to attend the conference. However, on Saturday, May 1, Bob Lazar came to meet with the attendees and answer questions. For most peo- ple his attendance was the highlight of the conference. Lazar, who arrived in a car with Nevada license plate \"MJ-12,\" was cordial and seemed a bit uncomfortable in the spotlight. He had no planned formal presentation but was willing to answer nearly all questions put to him. The only ones he declined to address had either to do with specific people who preferred to remain anony- mous, or with patents which he is currently working on. Lazar's main presentation took place in a large tent erected outside the Inn for the conference. But since a presentation was in progress when he arrived, he agreed to sit and answer questions for a small group of people inside the Inn itself before the main session. A tape recording was made of this informal \"press confer- ence,\" portions of which are printed here with Lazar's permission. WHO IS BOB LAZAR? Before delving into the transcript, it would be appro- priate to review Bob Lazar's claims and his background. Lazar claims to have degrees in Physics and Electronics Technology and claims to have attended Cal Tech and MIT. In the mid to late 1980s, Lazar worked at Los Alamos Labs in New Mexico. Then, over a period of five or six days between December of 1988 and April of 1989. he was allegedly employed at a desert test area called S-4. a job which he believes may have been arranged through the efforts of the famous physicist Edward Teller. S-4 is about 15 miles south of Area 51. Some 125 miles north of Las Vegas, Area 51 has been the secret test site for such aircraft as the U-2 and Stealth Fighter. Lazar claims that no alien craft are being tested at Area 51. After his arrival at S-4, Lazar claims to have re- ceived a short briefing paper about two pages long which essentially stated that extraterrestrials exist, they have been involved in human history and their spacecraft are being housed at S-4. Bob was told that it was his as- signment to assist in \"back engineering\" the propulsion system of one of the craft. Back engineering means an- alyzing something that already exists and figuring out how it works. Efforts by Lazar and others were al- legedly successful—the propulsion system's basic theory of operation was determined, although there was only minor success duplicating the engineering with earthly technology. Test flights of the craft were held periodically in the immediate vicinity of S-4. Lazar had access to the test schedules. After working at S-4 for a time, he met John Lear, son of the founder of the Lear Jet enterprise. He in- vited or agreed to take John to a location near S-4 to view one of the tests, and in the process was discovered by base security. This and some other factors led to Lazar's subsequently leaving the program. His experi- ences were made public shortly thereafter. Since that time, Lazar has made few public appear- ances, but did make a video tape which summarized his experiences and explained the basic operating theory of the crafts' propulsion system. His appearance at the A'Le'Inn conference was one of those rare appearances. THE TRANSCRIPT The transcript which follows is nearly verbatim.

BL: Right after I got there, around the first of '89. Q: Did you ever personally work with any Soviets? BL: No, 1 never did see them; I just heard that they Q: were there. Q: 1 was wondering, do you have formulas written down concerning element 115 as to how it emits the gravity waves? BL: Just stuff that we scribbled down.  BL: Q: Can it be reduced to formulas?  Q: BL: I'm sure everything can. You know you need to play around with it some more. Q: Did you live on the base? BL: No. But I know that people do. Q: So they moved you to and from Vegas each day? BL: BL: Yeah. Q: Who runs security? Do they have a parent orga- nization? Wackenhut? BL: No, don't think it was Wackenhut. I don't know who they were but I never paid attention to it there. Q: Did they have names on their — BL: No. Q: How would you describe their uniforms?  Q: BL: Some guys just had straight dark blue on. Other guys that were outside had that desert cam- ouflage — you know that beige-colored stuff — on. But for the most part, they had dark blue uni- forms on. Q: There were people who confirmed your informa- OCTOBER 1993 NUMBER 306 tion to George Knapp; do you know who they are? Yeah. He knows one of the guys in blue. So I think George knows what organization they're a part of. Did they give George their names? Did he talk to you to confirm that they were associated with S-4? Well, one person related information to George, and so George asked the person to describe stuff that I haven't told other people, for example, where various things were located in the complex, and everything the person said was right, so there's no doubt that he was there. Did you have friends you worked with that you also socialized with? No. [unintelligible] I was becoming friends with one guy I worked with but— Do you speak now to anybody from that time period? No, but I wish I could. In your tape, you talked about possible alien influence in history. You said you read some things about that in your initial briefing at S-4, but you did not go into the details in your video tape. Can you share anything more about that? All I know is really what I said in the tape: that there were 65 or 66 corrections [Ed note: referring to past alien genetic corrections of the human race, I believe] but you know, I can only put so much credit in that stuff. You said that there were actual video tapes that existed of historical events, apparently made by aliens. I think you mentioned that in your video tape. Were those alien tapes seen by you or were they just indicated in the briefing? No, it was indicated. Before the theory was pieced together as to how these craft work—the propulsion system, that is— what were the previous theories? Were they pur- suing any other methods to accomplish the same type of travel? Well, they always knew it was some sort of field propulsion just because there were no high pres- sure areas, propellers, or nothing along those lines coming out of the craft, so they knew it was some soft of field propulsion, maybe electromagnetic. Essentially, they couldn't measure anything com- ing off the craft except by-products of the electro- magnetic energy from the reactor. I think they're only pursuing gravitational propulsion. I read in a book somewhere that there was an inventor, I guess in the 40's or 50's, named Townsend Brown. From what I remember, he took an electromagnet, and when you first turn an elec- tromagnet on, it moves. And he said that he could harness that energy to create flying crafts or what- ever. Is stuff like that feasible? PAGE 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL BL: No. I've seen all kinds of crazy claims about BL: how they [the craft] operate...and I mean most of them are ridiculous. Q: Bob, other than the propulsion technology, which is obviously the most amazing of the whole Q: picture, was there any other technology that you saw that would be as amazing to us, maybe their BL: communication technology? BL: I don't know. Like I said, I was only privy to information about propulsion, but the communi- cations really concerns me. It bothers me because it doesn't make sense. If you're dealing with an in- Q: tense gravitational field that distorts everything BL: around the craft radio waves would not be able to penetrate [the field to reach] the craft: they should be distorted just like light is around the craft. Yet, Q: the ground controllers at S-4 were in contact with the craft during test flights. There's things that I want to know about it, and one of them is the BL: communications. One possibility is that it is some sort of modulated gravity communication which Q: would be unbelievable. Q: What did you know about Project Looking BL: Glass? [Ed. note: allegedly a project to look back- ward in time]   Q: BL: Very, very little.   BL: Q: Is that project being run out of S-4 as well or is that at another location? BL: No. All that's at S-4.   Q: Q: When you were threatened before going to Japan for an interview, why do you think that they haven't made threats like that while you're here in this country? BL: What do you mean? Why don't they threaten me now? I don't know. A lot of time has gone by. I BL: can't even guess. You know, maybe that was be- fore much word got around, and they were more Q: concerned about it back then. Q: Have you had any network exposure, I mean BL: with major networks like ABC or CBS? BL: Some of the trash stuff, like \"Current Affair,\" have picked up on the story. Q: There were no serious attempts to get your story? Q: BL: Oh, yeah, there was CNN and a bunch of other places that did run something. Yeah, there was BL: quite a bit. Q: Anything from scientific groups? BL: Not that's published and that's ongoing now. Q: Why do you think it's taking so long for main- Q: stream science to— BL: Oh, they hate stuff like this—not UFOs, but they hate it if you come up with another theory that es- BL: sentially disproves everything else. You can't be- lieve the jealousy in that field. They'll spend the rest of their careers just trying to [academically] as- sassinate you and ruin your credibility. Q: Ego? PAGE 10 NUMBER 306 Oh, absolutely. Especially if you're a young guy and haven't been involved in their work. I mean they might have worked their whole lives in the thing and they can't— Your co-workers at S-4, did you detect an arro- gance or ego on their part? No. Not at all. They really feel privileged, as I did when I was there, to be involved with it. And we kind of pushed off everyone else. The feeling was something like, \"you're right, this should be secret, to hell with everyone else.\" [laughs] I would agree with that, that's what I would do. Yeah, believe me, when you're involved with it, you feel like, \"hey we're itl\" That's really the at- titude I had when I was there. You made the statement that there is some infor- mation which you choose not to reveal. I imagine that's because of national security. Oh, there's information about weapons and things like that — [unintelligible] so didn't you feel like you were breaking some kind of an honor code by— Well, not just honor but legally [unintelligible] but— Why weren't you imprisoned? Well, what are they going to bring me up on? For them to do that, they would have to say that this is secret information. Does it concern you that nobody else has come out publicly? [Ed note: at the Triad UFO confer- ence in July 1993 in Seattle. George Knapp, the TV reporter who has been following this, said that he has had several sources separately confirm ele- ments of Lazar's story.] Well, yeah, publicly it bothered me, but you know, privately, people have. Did you ever speak among your co-workers and say, \"God, this is so incredible...\" Yeah, to another guy [name deleted]. That's why I'm really anxious to find him...because he seemed like, with coaxing at that time, he would have said something. Do you know of any other place where this kind of work's going on? I was told when I was there that S-4 was the only place. You know there were stories of Hangar 18 and other Air Force bases that...purposely every- thing is kept at one location. Did you ever get the feeling that maybe if you had stayed in this just a little longer, you'd have more to tell? Why didn't you go that route? Oh, well, there's a big long story why I left. [Ed note: Later in the conference, Lazar told the story in which he, John Lear and others were caught near S-4 watching a test of one of the crafts of the type Lazar was allegedly working on. This and OCTOBER 1993"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL related circumstances caused Lazar to leave the BL: program.] Q: I know they kind of threatened you because of Q: meetings with John Lear. BL: Yeah, but there's a big chain of events that hap- pened, I mean they—   BL: Q: Bob, there's a lot of speculation as to why, right Q: after you started, you spoke to John. Did you feel morally obligated to come out and tell the story so BL: the rest of us would know? BL: I haven't the slightest idea why I told John. 1 really didn't know him that well then. But I found Q: out that the things they [people at S-4] told me about John were essentially a lie. And John has spent a couple of years trying to track this [the S- 4 story] down. And, because at the time I had the flight schedules, really all I did was say \"at 9 o'clock this day, there's going to be a flight, you want to see something?\" And we went out there BL: and watched, and [after that] I said, \"that's it, let's drop it.\"    Q: Q: Did John ever express any doubt about your BL: work or the things you were telling him? BL: Well, there wasn't much time from when I told him about the flight to when we went out to watch it. He brought out his Celestron telescope, and when we got out there, he whipped this big tele- scope out, and I said, \"oh, my God, okay, John, Q: that's it!\" Q: Did you at any time think you wanted to go to the regular media with this?  BL: BL: No. Obviously not.   Q: Q: Would you go to White Sides anytime, say, in a couple of hours maybe? BL: White Sides? What's that?  BL: Q: The mountain. White Sides, from where you can Q: see Groom Lake. BL: But nothing's at Groom Lake [Area 51]. [Ed BL: note: remember Bob claims alien craft are tested at S-4 not Area 51.] Q: Where would you go if you wanted to view what's going on at S-4? BL: People often go to the Mailbox Road [intersec- tion of Mailbox Road and Highway 375] but you Q: really can't see [any S-4 activity] from Mailbox Road; You want the road further up [a few miles south], the other long line on the map, Groom BL: Road. That's where we viewed it from. We went Q: all the way up and to the left [on Groom road] so we could get closer to S-4. Q: My friend works for Centel [a regional telephone company], and he says that if you go over by BL: Mount Charleston—I can't remember exactly where right now—you can see right down on [unintelligible] and you can actually see the vehicles moving from that area. OCTOBER 1993 NUMBER 306 From Mount Charleston? That's a hundred miles away, though. But he said he goes up there all the time and other Centel people do: they can see the vehicles moving. [Went on to the next question.] When you were working there, were there any connections with any projects in Australia? None that I heard of. I know that there are con- nections in the Soviet Union, but nothing in Australia. Bob, some people that have been hanging around the Mailbox, people that George Knapp used to corroborate your story, said that they saw a saucer- shaped object hovering around the Mailbox—ac- tually, it was about a hundred yards away. Would that be something totally different from something going on at S-4, non-exotic technology? Well, you know, down at Groom, they're work- ing on all types of secret aircraft. So you think that craft was terrestrial technology? I don't know, that depends on what they saw. If it's hovering silently, and it's a large...it's hard to say until you actually see it. I'm not privy to all the information, but I really don't know of any kind of vertical take-off and landing craft being worked on right now at Area 51, though there may be. Did they ever indicate that the technology that you were working on was associated with Roswell or previous crashes or anything like that? No. Bob, would you characterize your work at S-4 as being the most exciting thing you've ever worked on? [smiles] Oh, of course, yeah. Without a doubt. Do you think they'll he able to replicate a vehi- cle sometime in the future? Some of the technology, yeah, but not the propulsion. Because you'd need the reactor and the reactor is a technology that doesn't even exist yet [unintelligible]. You could certainly make a weapon out of the fuel, though. That would be very easy to do. John [Lear] said that you were the source of some information about the fact that the Grays were a mercenary force that was interfering. No. You said it's very difficult to get this propulsion system going: are the things that are flying strictly reactors built by alien technology? No terrestrial technology? No, absolutely. Nothing. One of the things we were trying to do was, starting with [alien] oper- ating reactors and operating amplifiers, we tried to substitute different pieces of man-made material in various parts of the system. The only thing we got to work was essentially substituting a wave PAGEii"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL guide, and of course that's essentially a pipe. But Q: when we made any changes to the gravity ampli- fiers they stopped working after that. You know, everyone was really afraid to fool around with the reactor too much. Q: You said in your video tape that they [techni- BL: cians trying to figure out how the reactor worked] Q: were playing with the reactor and there was an BL: explosion. [Ed note: Lazar said in his video tape Q: that this explosion happened in May of 1987.] BL: BL: Yes, supposedly the history of what happened before me was that— Q: Why were they cutting it open? What were they trying to achieve?   Q: BL: I read the notes from the guys and, believe me, cutting open an operating reactor under load is BL: the last thing I would do. I think they reached a point of frustration, and were probably pressured, for example, \"you guy's gotta come up with some- Q: thing.\" And I think they cut into what they thought BL: was the most innocuous or safest part of the reac- tor, and why they chose to do it when it was oper- ating. I have no idea.   Q: Q: Why were they killed? Why were they co-located with the device or even the vicinity? Wouldn't you do this remotely?   BL: BL: They were doing it remotely. If you've ever seen any of the [blast] rooms they have there [where nu- Q: clear weapons are tested underground], they have an area where the device goes, and removed back, there are blast doors where there's recording equip- ment. And you know, usually you can get the recording equipment after the detonation. Well [laughs] those two [blast] doors apparently weren't together and that room was destroyed. Q: Bob, you left there in what. '89, four years ago? BL BL: Something like that. Q: Do you think they've evolved to the point in their back-engineering work that they're flying the craft a little bit more? How fast were they evolving? BL: Extremely slow. Extremely slow. Q: Before they would fly these craft around the world or take them out in the solar system or something like that, do you think? BL: They've never left the atmosphere with the craft. Positively not.   Q: Q: [Do you know if it] will take 10 years, 20 years to do that? BL: I don't know if they'll do that. They are so para- BL: noid: when the thing lifts off the ground and over Q: to the right [laughs], people are sitting there pray- BL: ing that it comes back, and they never—  Q: Q: It's an extremely complicated thing to pilot? BL: BL: I don't know. I have no idea how to navigate the Q: thing. If someone threw me in the middle of it, I wouldn't have the slightest idea how to get it off the ground.    BL: PAGE 12 NUMBER 306 You mentioned when you went inside the sport model [Bob's nickname for the particular craft he worked on] it had really short chairs. Do you think they accommodated these to fit human pilots for the [tests]? They must have. Do you regret now having gone public? In some ways, yeah, but for the most part no. Were you glad you did it? Well it was more or less for selfish reasons because I [two words unintelligible] that's essen- tially what it was. Was I concerned that the world knew? No. [laughs] How do you feel about coming out [here to this conference] today? Coming out here today? I have no problem with it. Enough time has gone by. They say time heals all wounds. So— Do you feel like you've done the right thing? Ah [pauses], yeah, yeah I do. I really wish I had stayed with the project longer, though, because I really do want to know more about the technology. Were you ever briefed or made aware of any other propulsion system other than the one you worked on? [No verbal answer, but I assume he was shaking his head no.] Bob, usually when they have people like your- self working on something like propulsion, it [the secret information] is very highly compartmen- talized. They don't talk about anything else [except what you need to know], but you said that when you first got there, they showed you briefing pa- pers about various topics. Why do you think they did that? Yeah, virtually everything [is compartmen- talized]. I imagine that was just to relieve any pos- sible questions. But remember, when I talk about briefings, I'm talking about two sheets of paper, just like \"this is what's going on with the rest of the craft, this is what you're working on.\" And then the bulk of the information—99.8 percent—dealt specifically with what I was going to be working on. So, anyway, it was to alleviate any questions of \"Well, where did this come from?\" You said you had 38 levels |of security clear- ance] above \"Q.\" [Ed note: \"Q\" is itself a high- level clearance] Yeah, that's what I was told. How many levels are there? I don't know. Have you ever heard of higher levels? It never came up. Did you ever hear rumors of major government officials coming in to get tours, like congressman or whatever? I heard rumors of that, but you know, from what OCTOBER 1993"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL I was told when I was there, no one has ever stepped in there from any faction of the govern- Q: ment, Navy or whatever. People get tours of [Area] 51 all the time, but I've never heard of anyone BL: coming up through there [S-4]. Q: Have you talked to any astronauts? Anybody Q: who's walked on the moon? BL: Yeah.    BL: Q: And corresponded with them?  Q: BL: Well, they've come out to visit me. Q: They approached you? They initiated contact BL: with you?    Q: BL: [Non-verbal answer but from the flow of the fol- BL: lowing questions, 1 assume Lazar nodded yes.] Q: Q: Like [astronaut's name deleted] or somebody like that? BL: No, not [astronaut's name].[Ed Note: the ques- tioners proposed some additional names to which Lazar did not respond.]   BL: Q: You can't say who? BL: One of them was [name deleted]. He was the [number deleted] man on the moon.  Q: Q: What did he have to say to you?  BL: BL: Well, there's a faction of those guys that are...they're into it, but I guess it's dangerous. Well not really \"dangerous\" [but difficult] for them to express interest, but you know, these guys are on Q: pensions for the rest of their lives and— Q: What did they say to you? Right on?  BL: BL: Yeah, that was essentially what they said to me. Q: Bob, if you could return to work on the project, Q: would you go? BL: No. Q: You would not go?   BL: BL: No. Just because I don't trust them. If 1 could go with a little army [to protect me], I'd be...you know, no problem. If they'd give me stuff to do at home...[laughs] But no, I don't want to go back to a secure area in the middle of the desert. Q: In other words, go back completely on their Q: turf?    BL: BL: Yeah. Not a chance. Q: How do you feel about being such a celebrity in this area? Is it a nuisance to you? BL: No, it's not [a nuisance]. I just don't [unintelligi- ble reference to being low-key]. Q: What kind of work do you feel could get you Q: excited again right now? BL: Ah, weapons.   BL: Q: Weapons? Because of the financial rewards? BL: No, I like [laughs] really destructive things. Q: [Laughter in group] That's a surprising com- ment!    Q: BL: Well, you know, actually, 1 would have rather worked on Project Sidekick which dealt with them. Q: Really. BL: It would have been more along my lines; I don't OCTOBER 1993 NUMBER 306 know what I was doing [assigned to propulsion]. Do you think you'll ever get an opportunity to work in the field you want to again? Not at that level, no. But in other weapons devel- opment, I do [one word unintelligible]. You can imagine what a burst of gravity waves would do to something solid. It could be used for a lot of things. What is your background, Bob? You have a master's and bachelor's [degrees] is that right? Physics and Electronics Technology. It was MIT and— Cal Tech. If you had a craft with a gravity propulsion device aboard, and you were to intensify the grav- ity field around the craft, could it cause light to bend around it such that the craft would be cloaked from view? Yeah. It does [cloak a craft from view]. It depends where you are viewing it from. If you're directly under the craft, you see the sky above it. And if there's a mountain in back of it? I don't know how it...without actually observing it like that. I don't know what you'd see from the side or [how light waves] would travel along the side of the craft. It seems like they could operate in daytime per- haps with impunity in this way. Oh, yeah. From certain directions, I would think so. Do you think the crafts can operate invisibly, or is there always going to be some light accompa- nying them? No matter what, at night there's going to be a light accompanying [it]. You're dealing with a fluorescent tube essentially of a rare gas in the at- mosphere and a tremendous amount of energy be- ing generated. So the atoms in the air are essen- tially emitting photons. It's like a neon effect. Yeah, that's exactly what's happening. It doesn't happen in space because there is no rarified gas to illuminate. And at different levels of power you get different colors of glow. But for the most part, it should be blue: you may get a sodium yellow-or- ange type color. [Somewhat difficult to hear exactly.] As you get different power levels— Yeah, it will get brighter as it [the power level] goes up. [unintelligible phrase] The gravity field should distort that light, too, but it doesn't, so... [laughs]...there's a lot that doesn't make [sense]. That would probably be the argon in the atmos- phere that would turn blue? Continued on Page 16 PAGE 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL John Carpenter Still More Explanations (Part Two) A t the other extreme — as one reader correctly indicated — are those persons who accept everything as true and undeniably real. Every uniden- tified light source automatically becomes an extrater- restrial spacecraft, every odd-shaped cloud harbors a large \"mother ship.\" Every unidentified click on the telephone is another government agent listening in. every morning bruise, bump, or scrape must indicate yet another forgotten nighttime snatching. Every cre- ative thought is now assigned as coming from some celestial guardian rather than possibly from their own imaginative processes. These people are not hard to screen out from serious research because there is not one skeptical or sensible bone in their bodies. They differ from \"genuine\" abductees in that they seem to have no doubts, skepticism, uncertainty, or any desire for the experience to go away. They are not so much \"attention-seeking\" as in need of an experience. Practically none of the eighty cases 1 have researched have had these rather obvious traits. Still, the need to disbelieve takes many forms. I've been talking with a level-headed, polite, and rather cautious woman about her numerous unusual experi- ences—which she would prefer not to have occurring. Some encounters were quite disturbing, with other members of the family consciously aware of these strange events taking place in their home. Ultimately she settled for someone with whom she could work locally, talking to as many as five different investiga- tors. Each one gave her various \"explanations\" for each of her many symptoms. She entered investigation with just one mystery, but exited the interviews with at least 12 new and different problems. Her \"missing time\" was declared to be the first sign of a new epilep- tic condition for which she had never had any true symptoms or history. Her memory of a \"pear-shaped head,\" she was told, resulted from her unresolved trauma from a previous miscarriage. However, she had successfully completed therapy for that issue years earlier and was puzzled by this assumption. Golf-ball-sized lights, darting about in the interior of the home, were \"obviously\" the spark-like products of tectonic stress shifts in the earth's crust, never mind that there had been no recent seismic disturbances. When her six-week old baby went missing from her third-floor bedroom crib, only to be discovered neatly tucked away in the bassinet one floor below, she was told that either she or someone else had moved the baby without realizing it. When she found leaves in the crib — on several occasions — it was suggested that they blew in through an open window—which was never open — landing neatly and only in the crib. When details of what we might characterize as an \"abduction scenario\" began to surface consciously, she was told repeatedly that she suffered from a Fantasy Prone Personality disorder, and that she should refrain from talking with any researchers who actually believed in UFO abductions. She was shocked when her recollection of geometric shapes and symbols was interpreted as \"triangulated family problems\" and \"hidden marital discord.\" Unaccounted-for scratches, \"incisions,\" and triangular bruising, as well as \"glowing eyes\" in the bedroom, were all blamed on the house cat — despite the cat having been declawed and routinely kept behind locked doors downstairs at night. Finally, when she described a clear recollection of \"gray things coming through the window,\" it was announced with certainty that she had \"ghosts\"! FANTASY PRONE PERSONALITY The term \"Fantasy Prone Personality\" is not a recog- nized or accepted psychiatric diagnosis or category. It does not appear in any of the official Diagnostic and Statistical Manuals of Disorders which all mental health professionals know well. In fact, it is only discussed in UFO-related articles and research. Why? Because its creator is Keith Basterfield, a fine UFO researcher from Australia, who sincerely directed some studies to see if there actually was a tendency toward fantasizing among the population of alleged abductees. His results were negative or not significant, and he promptly withdrew the theory and its terminology at the M.l.T. Abduction Study Conference in June of 1992 (where we were roommates). However, there are researchers and skeptics still waving the flag for \"FPP\" despite its lack of valid- ity and recent burial. REPRESSED SEXUAL TRAUMA Repressed sexual abuse or trauma is frequently blamed as the source of all or most abduction accounts. There are many problems with this particu- lar \"explanation.\" First of all, after gathering specific background information and interviewing nearly 100 abductees, the incidence of any sexual trauma is not high and is quite similar to the incidence of sexual abuse reported in a random sample of the general pop- ulation. By sharp contrast, persons diagnosed with Multiple Personality Disorder nearly always have sex- ual trauma in their childhoods, and it is a strong con- tributor to the disorder itself. Clinicians expect to find severe abuse with this kind of disturbance. Abductees do not exhibit any typical pattern of sexual abuse in their backgrounds. And if there has been some kind of sexual experience, it does not seem connected to or symbolically represented in their particular abduction report. PAGE 14 NUMBER 306 OCTOBER 1993"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Secondly, any internally-generated material influ- enced by one's personal experiences is going to have the details and dynamics of that individual's life woven into a tapestry characteristic and symbolic of those pri- vate matters. It is inconceivable that thousands of others could have such strikingly similar accounts with match- ing details down to types of alien uniforms, insignias, procedures, movement, communication, crafts, interiors, lighting, actions, or physical descriptions. Humans do not even have the same exact nightmares every night be- cause the realm of one's imagination affected by in- tense emotions is so infinitely vast and boundless as to the creative possibilities. Thirdly, an abduction account with multiple witnesses or participants rules out the re- pressed trauma notion unless one is to believe that an eruption of repressed material can occur simultaneously in two or more different persons with matching and shared details rather than individualized scenarios re- flecting the private pain of different backgrounds, fam- ilies, and traumatic actions. FALSE MEMORY SYNDROME This particular syndrome does occur in suggestive situ- ations with suggestive subjects and pushy, less-skilled therapists. As a means of pleasing the hypnotist or in- terrogator, details can be innocently produced by the subconscious mind in order to fill-in blanks where the mind does not actually recall what happened. In the suggestive state of hypnosis these details can be rein- forced to the point of seeming to have occurred without any doubt whatsoever. Despite this sounding like the bell tolling for the end of hypnotic regressive research, there are many problems with this \"explanation\" — which on the surface seems to explain how abduction scenarios might be created. One problem is that much of the data produced in an abduction hypnotic regression session is unknown in its significance either to the subject himself, or to both the subject and researcher. In many sessions material was produced that neither the subject nor I had any idea or preconceived belief about. Until I compared notes with other researchers, I had no idea that I had 20 specific matches in details that I had never heard about previously. Many skeptics jump to the conclusion that if any confabulation occurs, then the whole encounter or ex- perience can be discounted. Confabulated details can be as simple and non-significant as which door of the car a witness recalls opening. This does not destroy the core experience, nor does it cause a major problem with the flow of events. Major contradictions might involve one witness stating the craft landed and lowered a ramp while a second witness recalls the craft just hovering and being \"beamed up.\" This type of discrepancy is prob- lematic and suggestive of confabulation on one or both witnesses' parts. Memory is not infallible and less im- portant details can be manufactured innocently to \"fill in the blanks.\" Confabulated details are unlikely to match other accounts well. The test of any data over time is the frequency of its occurrence in hundreds of reported ex- periences, the specificity of its matching other reports, and the unlikelihood of its origin being from an external source such as a form of the media. For example, when a witness describes a \"classic\" abduction scenario, I listen for unpublished factors and details that have only been discussed in private talks with other researchers. Without correlation to other reports confabulated details will drop out of data patterns in time and usually end up in the \"gray basket\" forever. In the two-part article. \"Remembering Satan\" (The New Yorker, May 17-24, 1993), an upstanding policeman is accused of sexual crimes against his own children that he doesn't remember — at least until pushy interrogat- ing leads him into thinking that he must have done it. The point here is that none of the accusations or con- fessions among all that were supposedly involved ever matched well — which is what one would expect with false, confabulated memories. Contradictions and em- bellishments abounded. With UFO abduction partici- pants, two or more persons abducted or involved in the same incident tend to find their independent reports correlating with amazing consistency and very few con- tradictions at all — suggesting an experiential base and foundation in reality. How could two people dredge up the same scenario, time sequence, and specific details just from imagination? How could they see each other aboard an alien craft and know what each was doing and when he did it if the experience was not real? M y own style of asking suggestive hypnotic questions which lead toward commonplace logical responses would certainly succeed with sub- jects who were manufacturing stories. To not fall for such leading suggestions means the subject must go against the logical flow and produce an illogical or seemingly irrational response in order to unknowingly match actual patterns of abduction data. Conscious observations of landed crafts and little beings match the accounts retrieved through hypnosis. And, finally, an important study performed on data from 519 cases of traumatic crimes (homicides, rapes, robberies) in the files of the Los Angeles Police Department add important support to the accuracy of hypnotic recall for events involving trauma. In 80.6 percent of the cases involving investigative hypnosis, additional information was obtained. In approximately half of those cases the accuracy of the new details could eventually be determined. Verified accuracy of the hypnotically retrieved information was rated at 90.7 percent with only 9.3 percent of the information proven to be inaccurate (Reiser, Martin [1982], \"Erickson and Law Enforcement: Investigative Hypnosis\" in Jeffrey Zeig [ed.], Ericksonian Approaches to Hypnosis and Psychotherapy, New York: Brunner/Mazel).

Order From: MUFON, 103 Oldtowne Rd., Segum, TX 78155-4099 / The following case summaries were prepared by Jerold R. Johnson, MUFON's Deputy Director of Investigations. Unless noted, no sound, vibration, or odor was detected. All times are local. • Log #930603|: On 8 February 1993 about 8:05 p.m.. a woman was driving home with her young daughter on Route 26 at Colebrook, NH when the girl pointed out a glowing, orange object in the sky: investigator, Sandra Black. With a \"color like fire.\" it was at least the size of a baseball field, according to the two witnesses, and hovering about a mile away from them above Titus Hill. As they watched, it moved off and eventually dis- appeared, leaving the little girl badly frightened. • Log #930604): The next night, Feb. 9 at about 7:25 p.m., again at Colebrook, NH, another sighting in the vicinity of Titus Hill was also first noted by a child and called to the attention of adults; investigator. Sandra Black. A nine-year-old boy stepped out of his house and saw a disk shape with multicolored lights around the rim approaching from the northeast. He got his stepfa- ther outside where they observed two of the disks now hovering, dark except for a single \"pink-orange\" light on the opposite side of each object. They were each \"larger than a house,\" hovering silently only 50 feet above the ground and 3 or 4 feet apart. The shape was like in- verted, shallow pie-pans with a flattened dome on both the top and bottom. Their steady lights began to Hash, as if they were signalling to each other, then they disap- peared in place simultaneously. The two witnesses were joined outside by the boy's mother, and they were talk- ing about the event when lights in a round pattern ap- proached, again from the northeast. This object, shape not clearly discerned behind the lights, passed over like an aircraft and even had the sound of jet engines, but was much lower than any aircraft should have been. The witnesses' drawings indicated a lighting pattern quite unlike aircraft lights. • Log #930805E: Back in October of 1978. on a moon- lit evening about 8:30. a man age 33 stepped out of his brother's house in Ludlow. VT and heard a \"high-pitch\" whistling sound overhead: investigator, Robert Heslop. He looked up to see a dark, concave, rounded boomerang shape. 1000-1200 feet high, moving east along a power line and descending. In the distance, he could see multi-colored lights flashing in groups around the perimeter, and a low central dome on top. Near the hilly eastern horizon, the object suddenly banked left and broke into 20 or 30 rectangular pieces that fluttered Continued on Page IS PAGE 16 NUMBER 306 OCTOBER 1993"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL The Unexplained by Jerome Clark Reviewed by Dennis Stacy T he first thing that needs to be said about this latest ambitious undertaking from Jerome Clark, a Vice- President of CUFOS, editor of the International UFO Reporter and a former Fate columnist, is that it comes in two formats — paperback and hardback. Many books do, of course, but here the differences are considerable. The popular paperback edition ($14.95) consists of a \"mere\" 443 densely-packed pages with numerous il- lustrations, but no index. For the record, ask for Unexplained!, subtitled \"347 Strange Sightings, Incredible Occurrences and Puzzling Physical Phenomena,'' from Visible Ink Press. Handsomely de- signed, Unexplained.', even in this somewhat truncated version, is an entertaining reference work that no serious anomalist will want to be caught outside his or her body without. The hardback version, the Encyclopedia of Strange and Une.\\plained Physical Phenomena, is available from Gale Research, Inc. for $49.95. Although the page count (395) is slightly smaller, the word count is actually larger, and there are considerably more illustrations plus a good working index. Both books are arranged alpha- betically by subject, although the hardback follows the more familiar format of a one-volume encyclopedia or dictionary and includes organizations and individuals left out of the paperback. Before going any further, I should point out a poten- tial \"conflict of interest\": I wrote one of the essays (on Crop Circles) that appears in both versions and con- tributed several pictures to same, one of which appears on the cover of the hardback. However, Clark wrote the utterly overwhelming majority of both books and I'm not receiving any royalties from the sale of same, so I have no hesitation in wholeheartedly recommending ei- ther. Let your credit card be the guide. If you can't afford the extravaganza of the Encyclopedia, opt for the bargain paperback. Alphabetically, the topics treated range from \"Airships, Unidentified\" to \"Yowie,\" the Australian version of Bigfoot, or Sasquatch. Sea Monsters are cov- ered as well, along with UFOs. abductions, cattle muti- lations, mad gassers, men in black, falls of strange mat- ter from the sky, disappearances, teleportation — the whole panopoly of paranormal, or so-called \"Fortean\" phenomena, after Charles Hoy Fort (1874-1932). Fort himself has a listing (pp. 115-17) in the hardback, as do the Fortean Society and Fortean Times, which you won't Hufford's argument has revolutionary implications in its assertion that rational people are accurately re- porting experiences that at least seem to be extra- ordinary and that those who have attempted to ex- plain away such accounts have not made their case or even understood what they are trying to explain. As a consequence, scholars have failed to come to grips with a significant part of human experi- ence...There is also what British ufologist Jenny Randies has called the \"Oz factor\"...the \"sensation of being isolated or transported from the real world into a different environmental framework...where reality is slightly different.\" For example, a witness may observe a spectacular UFO display on a well- traveled highway during rush hour and note the ut- ter absence of other traffic. — Jerome Clark (From the introduction to both volumes.) find in the paperback. (So does the Mutual UFO Network.) Ironically, given the author's previous massive three- volume encyclopedia on the subject, the entry on Unidentified Flying Objects as such seems relatively weak. Or perhaps wan is the better word. This isn't a complaint per se, and the \"problem,\" such as it is, is more than ameliorated by the fact that at least another dozen entries directly impact one way or the other on the UFO phenomenon as a whole. The bottom line is that both works are a labor of love. (And anyone who thinks authors automatically make a comfortable living from their chosen profes- sion is obviously employed in another one.) That doesn't mean that every reader of this review need to rush out and buy a copy. But anyone who wonders (or worries) about the outre extremities of human experience — and the ultimate nature of reality — should. As it turns out, there is a lot more unexplained and unknown about the world at large than UFOs alone. ROUND IN CIRCLES By Jim Schnabel Hamish Hamilton, London, 295 pp., photos, £16.99 Reviewed by Dennis Stacy N ot yet 30, Jim Schnabel has already made a name for himself in the field of the paranormal. In some circles that name is a curse word, his first book, Round in Circles, being the case in point. If you're not men- tioned by name, you may feel it's one of the best books on the so-called paranormal you'll ever read — at times insightful, witty, ironic and falling-down funny. But if OCTOBER 1993 NUMBER 306 PAGE 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL you're English and your name is mentioned more than twice, there's a good chance you've already consulted your solicitor in hopes of suing the author. Some of the reviews that have appeared in the UK press, both cere- ological and mainstream, have been downright vicious, and in at least one instance outright libelous. Among cereologists, it seems, a sense of humor is directly pro- portional to one's distance from the phenomenon. Schnabel's \"crime\"? For one thing, he's an \"upstart\" American living and studying in England. Secondly, he had the effrontery to look at crop circles from the wrong end of a dowsing rod. Instead of being mesmerized by these circular cutouts, he asked himself an obvious ques- tion: might I not be able to do the same thing by hand? And thus began his own hoaxing career and descent into controversy. In almost less time than it takes to carve out a large pictogram, Schnabel was soon accused of being the central cog in a vast conspiracy aimed at dis- crediting — or seemingly worse, disinforming — the crop circle phenomenon. Innuendo had it that at one time or another he was in league with the CIA and other \"dark forces,\" and even the Vatican itself, although why any of the above would be overly interested in crop cir- cles per se the conspiratorialists never quite make clear. Nor does Schnabel himself dwell on ultimate expla- nations. More than anything, Circles is an entertaining examination of the human and historical side of cereol- ogy. of the particular personalities involved, and how their quirks and penchant for perks (supplied by media attention and burgeoning book and video sales) resulted in a sort of self-imposed disinformation process of its own. Schnabel demonstrates quite convincingly that most researchers approached what was supposed to be a remarkable new development with the baggage (or learning, if you prefer) of their past relatively intact. Thus, for a meteorologist like Terence Meaden, the cir- cles almost had to be a byproduct of the weather, lead- ing him to develop the theory of a whirling plasma vor- tex. Bestselling authors Pat Delgado and Colin Andrews (Circular Evidence) approached the phenomenon with their previous prejudices intact, too. In short, dowsers quickly demonstrated that the mysterious energy causing the circles could be dowsed, ley line enthusiasts con- cluded that they were oriented in the direction of ancient stone henges, white horses and other monuments, medi- ums that the \"higher intelligence\" responsible could be channeled, ufologists that the circles were the product of an unknown aerial phenomenon and so on. Eventually, even the Earth goddess Gaia and the Hopi Indians were dragged into the fray. The circles were either harbingers of global changes or omens of disasters to come. And then there were the confessed hoaxers like Doug Bower and David Chorley. complaining that their hand-made templates were appropriated art for which they weren't receiving their proper due (and pay). The only thing that can be said with safety concerning circles is that everyone can't conceivably be right. Rob Irving was interrogated by the police one day, but only because they thought he had infor- mation about other people who were hoaxing cir- cles. Alas, he didn't, and in a telephone conversation that ensued with a Pewsey policeman Irving tried to explain that there were many hoaxing groups, and that all of the formations were hoaxes. There was a moment of stony silence, and then the policeman said, \"I don't want to get into a philosophical dis- cussion with you, but they can't all be hoaxes.\" — Jim Schnabel (Round in Circles) Round in Circles won't end the ongoing controversy, either. Believers will continue to believe and nonbe- lievers won't. Middle ground is still hard to come by, and those who try to approach it largely ignored or cas- tigated as contributing to the conspiracy of disinforma- tion. Read Schnabel for yourself and draw your own conclusions. I doubt it'll be published in an American edition, but you should be able to obtain a copy through Arcturus Books. However you get hold of it, I doubt you'll be able to look at another crop circle in quite the same light again. CASES - Continued from Page 16 down out of sight in the moonlight. There was no ex- plosion or crash, just this odd breaking apart. One piece was cigar-shaped and seemed to be in a controlled fall at a 45° angle. It emitted one white beam of light toward the sky from its upper end before it was lost to view be- yond the horizon. The witness reported what he had seen to the local police by telephone. Within a half- hour, the chief of police, a Vermont state police officer, and \"3 U.S. Government plainclothesmen\" arrived at their house in this rather small Vermont town in several official vehicles, some bearing \"U.S. Government\" li- cense plates. He was questioned at length by the \"plain- clothesmen,\" whose names and affiliation he did not remember, but he got the clear message from them that \"he did not see what he thought he saw\" and this left him bitter and angry. One \"government man\" made a big show of telephoning several small, nearby airports in the presence of the witness and his brother, and inquiring if anything had been tracked on their radar, with apparent negative responses. MUFON's investigator checked on the airports that the witness remembers from that night, and found that they had no radar facilities; some even should have been closed at that hour. The witness, now age 46, saw a newspaper announcement for a MUFON public lecture in May 1993 and decided to attend and re- late his story to investigators. PAGE 18 NUMBER 306 OCTOBER 1993"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Letters to Mufon UFO Journal TRANSCRIPTION PROJECT In reply to the letter by Jeanne Robinson, I certainly share her concern regarding anonymity of CE-4 sub- jects and confidentiality of their accounts, for I live with it every day. In fact, as a precondition, every MUFON volunteer transcriber must sign an affidavit by which (s)he agrees that: (a) no one else may listen to any audio- tape or read any resulting transcript; (b) no one, including the transcriber, may copy a tape, computer disk or transcript; and (c) the transcriber is not permit- ted to discuss the contents of any such case with any- one. The affidavit concludes with the statement: \"Failure to adhere to these conditions will cause your dismissal from MUFON, and you can be sued in a civil action.\" Ultimately, as the Abduction Transcription Project Manager, I am responsible for protection of subject identities. Telephone calls and correspondence, including frequent newsletters, underscore this crucial matter to our transcribers. Moreover, we routinely delete surnames and any address or phrase by which a subject or family mem- ber might be identified. Through the first year, well over 300 tapes have been processed with no security breach. Could a subject's name or story still be revealed inappropriately? Of course. It is also possible, but just as unlikely, that the researcher conducting the sessions would betray such a trust. Obviously, all subjects should ask about the final disposition of the audiotapes of their sessions. And, speaking for the dozen researchers participating in the Project, none would forward any tape for transcription over the objection of a subject. I am unabashedly proud of our exceptional group of transcribers, many of whom are CE witnesses themselves or have experience as MUFON field investigators. They, the researchers and I seek only to contribute to resolving this baffling enigma with assembled facts. We are not interested in holding any subject up to public scrutiny. There are a multitude of entity types and circum- stances presented in the assembled transcripts. Time and financial demand on our dedicated abduction researchers prevent their preparation of transcripts by other means. Given those conditions, I'm willing to take a per- sonal risk in order to prepare materials for analysis and thereby answer the fundamental question, ''What's going on?\" I hope any other CE-4 subjects who read this likewise want to be part of the solution.

South St. Morrice, MI 48857 APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY Regarding John Carpenter's \"Abduction Notes\" in the August 1993 Journal: When one is maligned in print and accused of offenses one did not commit or had no part of, or when words are put in one's mouth that he did not utter, or when statements made over the telephone to a reporter are garbled in the time interval between utter- ance and publication with no opportunity for perusal or clarification — one has no choice but to try to set the record straight. In reference to the statement attributed to me by re- porter Huznik in the USA Weekend Report, it went in correctly but came out confused. What I intended to say or did say (which was garbled), or what I meant to say was simply that \"It is possible for two people in the same situation at the same time, for example a haunted house, who are exposed to the same environmental sit- uation and who have the same set of expectations (about ghosts, for example), when exposed to the same stimu- lation ( a flash of light from a passing car) to report they saw a 'ghost'. When the true believers then discuss and compare their experience — reinforcement and confir- mation is the only predictable outcome.\" Concerning my professional background and training and experience with hypnotic regressions and as a ''clin- ical or direct practice psychologist\" — all Carpenter had to do was to call or write me. Instead he made it ap- pear that I have had no experience of any sort \"in the real world.\" In my 40 years of applied psychological practice 1 have worked as a clinical psychologist for 4 years, forensic psychologist for 8 years, industrial psy- chologist for 8 years, and military applied psycholo- gist for 16 years. I have been an American Psychological Association Fellow for the last 25 years and a member of the American Society of Clinical Hypnosis for many years and have carried out research on hypnotic regres- sion and progression, memory, memory distortion, con- fabulation, hallucinatory phenomena and delusions over the past 20 years. Moreover, in the process of doing this research on hypnosis and memory 1 have \"hypno- tized\"' well over a thousand individuals and have studied their fantasies and imaginative productions such as \"past lives,\" \"future lives,\" \"early memories,\" \"false memo- ries,\" \"delusions and hallucinations.\" In the course of these investigations I have encoun- tered a number of clients who imagined: I) they were living on another planet in a distant galaxy; 2) they were being pursued by an invisible demon who would only show himself whenever they attempted sexual in- tercourse; 3) they could control any and all electrical de- OCTOBER 1993 NUMBER. 306 PAGE 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL vices via mind power alone; 4) they were the reincar- nation of their own grandmother on their father's side; and 5) they personally had been empowered by God to control the course of floods, earthquakes and hurri- canes. Interestingly enough, none of these individuals were so deranged or disturbed that they were in need of either hospitalization or medication. They all were fully capable of holding their jobs, interacting successfully with others, caring for themselves and their needs, and they were in no way dangerous to themselves or others. Mr. Carpenter may find this hard to believe, but over the past decade and since the publication of Strieber's Communion I actually did, honest to God, encounter six, repeat six, perfectly normal but deluded individuals who recalled, after so-called \"hypnosis.\" memories strangely like those that have been widely reported in the media as \"alien abductions.\" Two of these individuals suffered sleep paralysis with the accompanying familiar hypnopompic hallucinations; two others gave reports that were based on their extensive readings of the UFO literature, and as for the other two, one had persistent hypnogogic dreams of alien visi- tations and interviews with the alien on the cover of Streiber's book, and the last one suffered from insomnia brought on by the fear that if she did, indeed, fall asleep she would be abducted and raped by alien monsters. All six of these clients were assured that no abductions took place, that the human imagination and normal sleep and memory processes can prove to be very deceptive, that they were in no way crazy or insane, and that they had nothing whatsoever to fear. None of the six continue to believe their fantasies and delu- sions and hallucinations were or are veridical. Other stories of this sort any interested reader can find in my two books, They Call ft Hypnosis (Prometheus, 1990) and Hidden Memories (Prometheus, 1992). In closing, I would like to en- courage Mr. Carpenter and other therapists to be very skeptical of stories they are told by clients who fall into the category known as The Eccentric Personality (Schizotypical Personality Disorder). These people hold strong beliefs that resemble the delusions seen in schizophrenia, but they are otherwise completely rational and have none of the cognitive deficits or other problems of the truly psychotic. Their fantasies should not, however, be believed. — Robert A. Baker, Ph. D.

OCTOBER 1993 NUMBER 306 PAGE 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL November 1993 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Saturn (magnitude 0.8), in Capricornus. is low in the SSE at dusk and sets later in the W shortly before 11 PM in mid- month. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Jupiter (-1.7), in Virgo, reappears in the early morning sky. rising in the E about 4:30 in mid-November. Venus, some 8 times brighter (at -3.9), rises about half an hour later. Earlier in the month, on the 8th. Venus closes to only half a degree above Jupiter and then passes below the larger planet. The planet pair forms a nice triangle with the lunar crescent on November 12. with Mercury below. From the 18th to 26th. Venus. Mercury. Jupiter, and the star Spica all line up. Since all of these dawn events take place low in the sky, binoculars should be used to get a better view. Moon Phases: Last quarter—November 7 New moon—November 13 First quarter—November 20 Full moon—November 29 € O The Stars: The bright star patterns of winter, such as Orion the Hunter and Taurus the Bull, show up now in the E during the mid- evening hours. Don't be fooled by the illusory Hashes and ap- parent movements of dazzling Sirius when the star rises in the ESE about 10 PM (midmonth). Pegasus and its Great Square have drifted west of the celestial meridian in the S. And the Northern Cross (alias Cygnus the Swan) stands upright in the western sky. In the N the Big Dipper rests in its worst evening position of the year, its handle-tip scraping the horizon. For latitudes below 40 C . the dipper stars begin to vanish below the horizon. Total Lunar Eclipse: On the night of November 28-29 all of North America will see a totally eclipsed full moon — weather permitting. This is the 2nd such eclipse this year. The Moon enters the dark central shadow of the Earth at 11:40 PM (EST) and then progresses gradually toward totality. Our satellite is completely covered from 1:02 to 1:50 AM. Since the Moon passes through the southern edge of the shadow, there should be an interesting range of brightness visible on the lunar surface. The Moon's disc is fully restored at 3:12. Transit of Mercury: The solar system's innermost planet Mercury crosses in front of the Sun about 13 times per century. This will occur for the first time in 7 years on November 5. In the U.S. only persons in Hawaii and the Aleutians have a chance to view the first part of this rare show. A small telescope is necessary in order to glimpse the planet's tiny black silhouette (10 seconds of arc) slowly skirting the SW limb of the Sun. Mercury first notches the S edge of the solar disc at 5:06 PM (Hawaii- Aleutian time). However, the Sun sets before Mercury's mid- transit. For safety, the Sun's image should be projected through the telescope eyepiece onto a white surface. (On a projected view the round dot of Mercury moves from the bottom of the Sun up along the left edge of the disc.) Meteor Showers: A bright gibbous Moon interferes all night during the South Taurids peak on the night of November 2-3. The slow reddish meteors normally reach about 10 to 15 per hour before dawn. On the other hand, the swiftest of all shower meteors, the bluish Leonids, achieve maximum (15 per hour) under dark skies on the morning of the 17th.

Mr. Theer has temporarily accepted the role of Administrator of the MUFONET-BBS. His Data Line is (512) 556-2524 and home number (512) 556-2746. EASTERN REGIONAL DIRECTOR ELECTION Due to a vacancy on the MUFON Board of Directors for the position of Eastern Regional Director, candi- dates are being solicited immediately for a full four- year term. This is an opportunity for present state directors, assistant state directors, state section direc- tors and other leaders in the eastern region to accept greater responsibilities with the Mutual UFO Network. The eastern region is composed of the fol- lowing states: ME, VT, NH, MA, CT, RI, NY, PA, NJ, DE, MD, WV, VA, NC, SC, GA, FL, PR, and VI. The Regional Director is elected by the members within the above states. Any interested person is invited and encouraged to submit their name to either their respective state director or Walt Andrus in Seguin as a candidate for this vacancy by November 15, 1993, so an election may be conducted by mail. This presti- gious position is only one of the four MUFON Board of Directors elected by the membership that they rep- resent. To date, only one candidate has been nominated. He is Dana M. Schmidt, J.D., State Section Director for the Rochester, New York area, who has been a member of MUFON since 1980. The deadline for nominations has been extended from October to November 15 to accommodate additional candidates. Eastern Region State Directors should mail their UFO sighting reports to Jerold \"Ron\" Johnson, MUFON Deputy Director of Investigations, 12700 Silver Creek, Austin, TX 78727, until such time as a new Eastern Regional Director is elected. MUFON 1994 SYMPOSIUM The theme for the MUFON 1994 International UFO Symposium is \"UFOLOGY: A Historical Perspective,\" commemorating MUFON's 25th anniversary and sym- posia. It will be hosted by Texas MUFON at the Hyatt Regency Hotel on Town Lake in Austin, Texas, on July 8, 9, and 10. Ellen R. Stuart, State Director, is serving as the host chairperson. Special events are being planned to celebrate MUFON's silver anniversary. Several of the speakers will draw from the histori- cal aspects of Ufology in their presentations. They are James A. Harder, Ph.D. (APRO), Richard H. Hall (NICAP), John F. Schuessler (MUFON) and Robert O. Dean (military) from Tucson, AZ. Other speakers confirmed are George Wingfield (English Crop Circles); George Knapp (Russian UFO Files); Rev. Barry H. Downing, Ph.D., author, minister, and con- sultant; and Michael Lindeman from Santa Barbara, CA. WEATHER NEWS NETWORK An essential aspect of each UFO report investigated and filed is the prevailing weather conditions at the time of the sighting. Weather reports can be secured from the local newspaper office file if the UFO sight- ing is a current report, however this is not feasible for older events. We now have a solution to this problem. Val and Louise Rose, new MUFON members in Michigan, operate a weather service business. They have been providing weather data to Michigan MUFON over the past two years. Now that they have joined MUFON, they want to provide this service free to all members. Previously, this information was only available from the National Weather Service in Ashville, NC for a substantial fee. They have prepared a special form titled \"Weather News Network for Mutual UFO Network.\" Blank copies may be obtained by writing to Weather News Network, Val and Louise Rose, P. O. Box 190262, Burton, MI 48519; Shirley A. Coyne, 73 Borman, Flushing, MI 48433 or MUFON in Seguin, TX. Each State Director has at least one copy in his/her annual State Directors Meeting Minutes from Richmond, Virginia, dated July 2,1993. MANITOBA PLANETARIUM UFO SHOW Ed Barker, Provincial Director for Manitoba, has been assembling a new planetarium show to be called \"UFO Report,\" a first in Canadian history. He has been working primarily with Michael J. Strainic, Canadian National Director, and Victor Lourenco, Ontario Provincial Director. Their production will open October 18 and 19, 1993, in Winnipeg, celebrat- ing the 25th anniversary of the Manitoba Museum of Man and Nature, when Stanton T. Friedman will be the featured speaker. Ed Barker is to be congratulated for this MUFON Canadian cooperative event in UFO public education.

Candidates may live anywhere in the world and do not have to be members of the Mutual UFO Network to be nominated for this prestigious award. A deadline of September 1, 1993, was selected so the names of the candidates could be listed in the September issue of the MUFON UFO Journal Number 305 as the first step in the balloting procedure.
