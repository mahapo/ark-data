FROM THE EDITOR Oh, wad some Pow'r the giftie gi'e us To see oursels as ithers see us! (Robert Burns, 1759-1796) An educational experience for UFOlogists who wonder why the subject is not taken seriously in many quarters would be to step back and take a hard look at the \"image\" of UFOs in the popular press, and indeed in many so-called \"UFO Journals.\" The general picture is a hodge-podge of obviously misidentified phenomena such as meteors, exotic \"Space Brother\" claims by opportunists or crackpots, rife speculation, uncritical lumping in of anything else mysterious, and the like. This is what busy scientists, Government officials, TV journalists, and skeptics tend to see. Given the same manure pile with no motivation for digging through it, I, too, would conclude that UFOs are a nonsense problem. It is our job to shovel away the manure and focus attention on the \"diamond\" we feel it is concealing.

The data presented here constitute a strong case for increased scientific, objective study of UFOs, and, in particular, of abduction cases. The names of the individuals and of the South Dakota city in question have been changed to ensure confidentiality. The witness, an artist and painter, age 50, contacted us shortly after listening to some of the speakers from the 1981 MUFON Symposium at M.I.T., on radio and television shows. She could recall only that several times she had seen two faceless, hooded, three-foot entities standing over her just as she had retired for the evening. They insisted that she had to go with them, and seemed to exert some sort of mind control over her. Within minutes she would hear a horrifying noise, and would experience the sensation of being sucked into a black vacuum, and the feeling of tumbling and tumbling. Under time-regressive hypnosis over a period of a year and 13 hypnosis sessions, a full-fledged abduction scenario emerged. During the episodes (which apparently number 6 or 7), the witness relived several incidents with genuine emotions, terror, and obvious fear. These included being taken onboard a saucer-shaped craft where she was given a thorough medical examination; visiting a room on the craft in which there were bins of cork- like chips, and there were literally hundreds of \"unfinished little people all over the room.\" She also visited a crystal-like pyramid city, which included a \"university\" with pyramid-shaped rooms. Another experience involved a visit to a \"factory\" in which a type of energy (from some sort of crystals) was being produced in a large machine. She was also taken to a shelter, from which vantage point she witnessed a bizarre ball lightning storm, and later she attended a meeting at an auditorium- type structure, during which people of all races from our earth were present and were being given a lecture telepathically by the entities. We asked her if she knew any of the humans there, and she indicated that she did, and she spoke to us at length about a young man from Anaheim, California, and a woman from near Hull, Massachusetts. Using the information furnished to us by our witness under hypnosis, we attempted to locate these two persons, but neither search produced any results. However, little did we realize that a few months later, almost purely by accident, a search in a different area of the country for another human who was allegedly at the same meeting in the \"auditorium\" would produce rather incredible results. At the end of the final hypnosis session, on August 16,1982, just before concluding the session, we told her that in a few minutes we would bring her out of hypnosis, and we asked if there was anything else that she would like to tell us about before that. After, a long pause, she replied, \"Ingrid Swenson. All right. Did I tell you about her?\" (Text of transcript of session follows, with names changed.) Linda Seal: No. Witness: She was the old lady at the meeting. Robert Sampson (investigator): Where is she from? Witness: Greenfield. Linda Seal: Greenfield, where? Witness: South Dakota. Marge Chrisfensen: She was with you at the meeting? Witness: Yeah. I forgot about her. I just saw her face when you said if there is anything else. Linda Seal: Tell us about her. .Witness: Oh, she's an old lady. Linda Seal: How old? Witness: 70? 60? Linda Seal: And how old are you? Witness: I'm only about 30. I'm 30. I was Humanoid \"abductor\" bom in February. Linda Seal: And what month is this? Witness: June. Linda Seal: So, you're almost 31. Why did you remember Ingrid? Witness: I don't know. She's pathetic. She's an artist. She's pathetic-looking. She's not unhappy. She's a nice lady. Linda Seal: Was anyone else an artist? Witness: I'm an artist. Linda Seal: Besides you and Ingrid? Witness: No, I don't think so. Marge Christensen: Why did you say Ingrid's pathetic? Witness: (chuckles) You should see what she's wearing. Well, she's got this long dress on; she's got shoes on with heels...you know, the fat heels? And she's got her stockings rolled down. She's just a nice lady. Linda Seal: How does she feel'about being there? Witness: She loves it. Everybody there loves it. She's been there before too. After the session concluded, during a discussion, the witness told us that Ingrid took care of people. Upon returning home that evening, I delved (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"S. Dak. Connection, Continued into the U.S. Atlas and found that Greenfield, S. Dakota, seemed to be a very small rural town. I banked on the fact that everyone would know everyone else, and that there might be a chance of locating someone who knew of Ingrid Swenson. The next morning, I called the Greenfield, S.D., City Hall and found that there is no art association in Greenfield, but there is an artist whom I could call and who would most likely know any artist from Greenfield about whom I was seeking information. That eyeping, I called the artist, and was astonished to find that there had indeed been an Ingrid Swenson who had recently passed away. She had been an artist, and was noted for rosemaling (Swedish carving). The artist was unable to furnish me with much specific information about Ingrid Swenson, except that she had never married, and had no children, but she did have a surviving sister. Therefore, I then had to devise a means by which to obtain more extensive information about Ingrid and to determine whether or not the information furnished by our witness about Ingrid was, in fact, accurate. It was a delicate task to formulate questions for an elderly lady (now residing in a nursing home) concerning the possibility of her deceased sister's having had a UFO abduction experience, as reported . by a Massachusetts witness. However, I carefully constructed a letter to the City Clerk in Greenfield, explaining objectively about the case and furnishing the page from the transcript of the hypnosis session in which pur witness spoke about Ingrid Swenson of Greenfield. Within a week the reply from Greenfield arrived. It confirmed that the age estimate given by our witness was pretty accurate, since Ingrid had died in 1980, at the age of 77, making her 60 years old at the time of the \"auditorium\" experience. Then, to my surprise, a few days later, I received a lengthy letter from the attorney who handled the estate of Ingrid Swenson. The City Clerk and City Auditor had shown him my letter, and he had gone to visit Miss Swenson's sister, Mrs. Groff. In his letter, the attorney, Mr. Manning, stated that Ingrid Swenson had been a registered nurse by profession, and an artist as a hobby. Our witness had told us that Ingrid took care of people, and this certainly applies to nurses. The following is a quote from Mr. Manning's letter: \"Mrs. Groff (Ingrid Swenson's sister) told me that Ingrid has never been in the East, except that a few years ago the two of them went on a bus trip through the New England states and came back by way of Canada. They made no stops except for food and lodging and, of course, attended no meetings. Mrs. Groff said Ingrid never, at any time, mentioned anything about UFO sightings. The description of your 'abductee' is quite accurate in the description as to the Ingrid Swenson of Greenfield, South Dakota, and also, as to her age. At the time in question, Ingrid Swenson would have been about 60 years old which corresponds with the 'abductee's' version. I would say that she did appear as a pathetic looking person, although not unhappy. She also did wear longish dresses and with the kind of shoes indicated. Mrs. Groff couldn't recall that she ever walked around with her stockings rolled down. Ingrid Swenson and her sister were both nice ladies. \"I am going to send some pictures which will include Miss Swenson, which may be helpful. Miss Swenson during her period as a nurse worked only in the Dakota's and Minnesota and never, under any circumstances, been east of Minnesota which,' of course, would preclude or mean that she never worked in any hospital in Massachusetts. / know of no way in which your 'abductee' could ever have met Miss Swenson.\" (emphasis mine) The photographs arrived, and we arranged for the witness to meet with us to select the correct person from a group of eight ladies (all pretty much the same age). The photographs were taken 20 years ago, and the incident reportedly occurred 19 years ago. We simply placed the photograph of the eight ladies in front of her, and instructed her to identify Ingrid Swenson. She was given no prompting or other instructions. At first, she Sketch showing humanoids' greenish-black \"cape\" pointed to Mrs. Groff, and then hesitated, saying, \"None of these really look like her. The coloring is just not right.\" Then, suddenly she moved her finger and pointed straight at Ingrid Swenson. At that point, she also remarked, \"She's a nurse. Did I tell you that?\" At that point, we showed her another photograph of Ingrid Swenson alone in her nurse's uniform. Upon looking at that photo, our witness exclaimed, \"Now, that's more like her! See, I told you the coloring was wrong in the other picture. See how much lighter she is here? See, her hair is lighter.\" At this point, she suddenly became noticeably shaken, and remarked, \"I'm really scared now.\" When asked why she became frightened at this point after several months of delving into the case, she commented that until now the entities could have simply been products of her fantasies, but now that another human being is involved, she feels that it is possible that her experience is real, and she finds that (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"S. Dak. Connection, Continued prospect very frightening. I continued to correspond with the attorney in S. Dakota, as well as with Budd Hopkins, New York City (author of Missing Time). I forwarded questions from both Budd and myself to the attorney, who was most gracious in managing to visit Mrs. Groff a second time to obtain answers for us. It is important to note at this point, that Mr. Manning stated that although Mrs. Groff is now 84 years old, she is quite mentally alert. , We were able to find out that Ingrid Swenson was apparently never missing for any particular time. She did not have any special fears, and was not nervous about any particular stretch of highway — except that about 10 years ago a deer jumped out in front of her car when she was driving, and while there was no damage, according to Mr. Manning, \"Ingrid Swenson never wanted to drive that road again.\" She apparently never talked about any dreams, nor were there any marks or scars on her body of which she did not know the origin. This leaves us with no indication of Ingrid Swenson's ever having had a UFO experience, and no explanation of how our witness in Massachusetts could possibly have been able to furnish us with such accurate information about someone on the other side of the country, whom she had never met. We were able to establish that our witness has never been to South Dakota, and, in fact, was unable to indicate for us the location of South Dakota on the map of the United States. We explored all sorts of possibilities to explain the case, but none of those explanations fit. We even checked into the fact that both our witness and the South Dakota individual have Scandinavian last names, and might have been distantly related. This is not the case. We eventually learned from Mr. Manning that Ingrid Swenson and her sister, Mrs. Groff, were featured in a hobby magazine article (Popular Handicraft) several years ago. We managed to obtain a copy of the article. Although some of the details furnished by our witness are confirmed by the article, the article does not include all of the information gained from the hypnosis session. For instance, there is no way to tell from the article that Miss Swenson was pathetic-looking, but not unhappy. We did question our witness thoroughly in regard to her ever having read anything about Ingrid Swenson. We questioned her during a hypnosis .session as well as after the session. We did not tell her that we knew of the article, and we used several subtle methods to see if she was withholding any information from us. None of our questions resulted in even the slightest hint that she ever read an article on Ingrid Swenson. We also visted her home without giving her an advance reason for our visit, and while there examined her magazines and asked her which magazines she generally reads. Popular Handicraft was not included in her list or in her magazines on her shelf. Since this is not an art magazine, but rather a hobby magazine, it is not the sort of periodical that an artist would find appealing. Neither Budd Hopkins, nor his wife, who is an art critic, had ever heard of this magazine. It appears that our witness is sincere and never saw an article on Ingrid Swenson. If this is so, how then was she able to know so much about a person she never met? And, how was she able to identify the correct person in the photograph which was taken 20 years ago (incidentally, over 10 years before the magazine article appeared)? And, what about Ingrid Swenson? Budd Hopkins feels that the incident about the deer darting in front of Ingrid's car may be very significant. He has a case in which a .Long Island woman lost 5 hours. It always frightened her and she had no explanation for the missing time. Two years after the incident she saw on television a shot of a horse leaping in front of a car, and the car swerved to avoid hitting the horse. The image terrified her, and she immediately connected it with the episode of missing time. In South Dakota, it is likely that deer running across the road in front of people's cars are not rare occurrences. Ingrid's fear of ever driving on that road again, even though there was no damage to her car t and no apparent injury to her, seems a definite over- reaction. Budd feels that the incident is quite suggestive, although, of course, unfortunately, we will never know. All of this serves to reinforce the importance of continued study of abduction cases, and the need to leave the conclusions for each case somewhat open-ended, with the possibility of further investigation at a later date. This case is also a graphic example of the importance of researchers sharing information and providing mutual cooperation with other UFOlogists whenever possible. We, in Massachusetts, are grateful to Dr. William Hassell, and the field investigators in Southern California who have attempted to locate the young man in Anaheim (mentioned earlier) for us. We are also indebted to Budd Hopkins, who has been extremely supportive and helpful with this case. Our greatest appreciation goes to the individuals in Greenfield, S. Dakota, for permitting us to intrude into their local community, and for being so gracious and friendly to us, in view of the fact that our only possible connection with them is through a possible UFO experience — something somewhat unsettling to the average person. A full report on the case is being submitted in the near future to MUFON Headquarters files.

Most of this material has had little or no publicity so I am sure that readers will find these cases very interesting. Names of witnesses will not be published at the request of the reporting parties.) September 22, 1977—Three UFOs were tracked on radar as they streaked over Omaha, Nebraska at 3 p.m. One of the four radar controllers who observed the targets gave this description of what happened: \"As I was looking at the scope something popped in that was pretty weird to me after working with radar for 17 years. What we were seeing was three objects that gave the appearance of aircraft. The size was much larger and they appeared out at about 430 kilometers and the speed of these things was terrific. One of the objects was moving in front and there were two of them behind at a distance of about 20 kilometers behind the first one, moving side-by-side at the same speed also. We kept watching these things and they were gone from our scope in less than a minute. I figured the speed with my calculator and came up with the fantastic figure pushing 17,000 miles per hour. I have worked on radar long enough to know what radar interference looks like and that was not it. The size of the targets at that distance was tremendous compared to regular aircraft.\" October 26, 1977—While flying at 19,000 feet between Abilene and Dallas, Texas at 5 p.m., the pilot and passenger of a small aircraft spotted a bright red stationary sphere in the distance at their 12 o'clock position. As their airplane closed on the sphere all navigation instruments became erratic and the pilot could not contact any facility by radio. The sphere suddenly changed from red to white, then went *P.O. Box 1807, Seattle, WA 98111 6 into a high speed vertical climb and vanished into space. The pilot said, \"As soon as the sphere left we got all of our radio gear back. Our navigation came back and we were off course.\" The two man crew of an Air Force T-38 flying in the same, area also observed the red sphere. According to the pilot, \"The bright red glowing object was at our 12:30 position approximately 10-12,000 feet and seemed stationary. After viewing the UFO for approximately 15 seconds the sphere appeared to be closing very rapidly. An evasive maneuver was considered but determined unnecessary. It. appeared the closing had ceased. The size of the object at this time was about that of a dime. \"The second member of the crew recalled considerable static over his headset at the time. November 18, 1977—A bright white light moving at a high rate of speed came alongside a small aircraft flying at 13,000 feet between Vichy and Troy, Missouri at 9:17 p.m., and paced the airplane for 3 minutes. The light then moved away at high speed. The pilot reported that while the light was abreast of his aircraft one of his transponders stopped working. After the UFO pulled away the transponder resumed its normal operation. December 8, 1977—Two large, brilliant circular lights maneuvered around a Golden West commuter aircraft for 15 minutes on its flight from Oxnard, California to Los Angeles International airport. \"One of the objects paralled us for 10 miles and then it moved away. Then it came back across my 12 o'clock position at a tremendous speed — like you would just snap your finger and it was there. It got so close it scared the hell out of me. There's just.no way that whatever that was, could it move with the intensity and the speed that it came to my 12 o'clock position, but it did,\" the pilot said. The Captain of the aircraft had been flying as a commercial pilot for 10 years. At 8 p.m. the same night — about 45 minutes before the airliner incident — four unidentified objects were tracked on radar by two air traffic controllers at a facility near Oxnard. \"We spotted four moving targets on the radar scope about 3 to 5 miles north of Laguna Peak. Scope readouts indicated that the targets appeared to move 5 miles in a sweep of the scope. I've always had an open mind about UFOs, but I've never seen anything like this in all 20 years that I have worked as an air traffic controller,\" one controller said. \"We watched the targets on the scope for nearly 3 hours.\" December 17, 1977—At about 3:45 a.m. radar facilities in Colorado and South Dakota tracked two unknowns moving at speeds in excess of 1,000 miles per hour. One of the UFOs made a close head-on pass at an aircraft in the area, the approach being observed on radar. The objects moved around over a wide area for about 30 minutes and their presence was unmistakable by the \"strong\" radar returns. A third radar station was unable to function while the objects were in the area and one of the two operational facilities was put out of service when the main shaft holding the radar antenna was severly bent by an unexplained force. February 5, 1978—A company airplane with six persons aboard was flying 20 miles northwest of Klamath Falls, Oregon at about 8 p.m. when all six persons observed a V-formation of 10 large, bright whitish-orange lights pacing the aircraft on the starboard side. After about 10 seconds the formation climbed slightly and moved away to the southwest at high speed. February 19, 1978—Two radar operators tracked a \"large\" UFO over Minnesota at 1:20 p.m. The object moved at a fantastic speed as it maneuvered about in the sky in an (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MENTAL COMMUNICATIONS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTURBANCE: PART II By Mark Moravcc (Copyright © 1980 by Mark Moravec) (In part I, three cases were reviewed and analyzed in terms of the degree to which they could be explained as resulting from psycholog- ical disturbance and delusional thinking. Here we pick up with Case 4 and present the author's conclusions.) Case 4. Mrs. D. claims to have had five UFO sightings. In the first sighting, the reporter got up from bed when she heard neighborhood dogs barking. She heard a soft, low-pitched humming sound, looked outside and saw a large silvery-white, cigar-shaped object facing three smaller cigar-shaped objects, all at a high altitude. Bluish- silver \"sparks\" emanated from one cigar while the largest cigar appeared to \"shudder,\" The witness woke her young granddaughter who, upon being shown the lights in the sky, became frightened and ran into another room. The objects were viewed for over an hour and then the witness tried to get some sleep. The following afternoon, the witnesses allegedly became ill, vomited, and had recurring headaches. Mrs. D. later discussed the sighting with her relatives. Strangely, her daughter-in- law was also to allegedly experience the same physiological symptoms! The second sighting occurred one night at 4 a.m. An orange-colored \"flying saucer\" with black sections or \"windows\" was seen for 20 minutes by Mrs. D. and her daughter-in-law (the latter allegedly becoming ill as noted above). After the object left, Mrs. D. felt \"...as if I had lost a friend.\" In the third sighting, Mrs. D. saw a vague, dark shape over the telegraph wires at 1:30 a.m. In the fourth sighting, she saw a white, dinner plate-shaped object in motion for 15 minutes while a passenger in a car. The object disappeared from view before anyone else could witness it. Her fifth sighting was of a triangular-shaped object, multi- colored, which appeared to move toward an airplane. Apart from these sightings, Mrs. D. has experienced hallucinations of Pilot-Radar, Continued apparent attempt to evade the radar beam. The object was first picked up on the radar screen at an altitude of about 8,000 feet. Before the object finally moved away, two separate radar systems were employed in an attempt to track the object. The following description of the incident was obtained from the radar operators: \"I got a good solid signal and it looked like an aircraft. I put the radar over on manual and moved it over on the target and as soon as I did the thing started going up rapidly so I followed it up. Then it stopped, then it went down. It appeared to be taking evasive action. As soon as I would get on it with radar it would move to get out of the radar beam. We got four good plots on the thing. We would get on it and it would just go straight up and stop, and come straight back down again. We got actual times on it and it went 5,000 feet in less than a second. I figured it to be about 3,400 miles per hour. It moved up and down on the vertical, instantaneously! \"It took both of us to keep on it. I got the impression that it was something that was evading the radar beam and knew that we were trying to track it. I tried to follow it manually and' the beam jumped from side to side. It looked like it just got ahold of the beam, more or less took control of the radar beam I guess. The beam would jump to one side or jump to the other. Every time I tried to get on it it would deflect it automatically. As soon as I would get close to being on it it would jump off to one side or the other. After we lost it the beam went right back to normal.\"D \"letters\" in the sky. Once she was standing at a bus stop and saw brown- colored \"initials\" (\"S\" and \"P\") which appeared to come out of a cloud. No one at the bus stop gave any indication of having seen the same thing.\" Another time, Mrs. D. was travelling in a car with her family when she again saw some letters in the sky^ However, the others in the car ridiculed her and claimed there was nothing to be seen. The reporter also claims to have had two visions of Christ in a neighborhood church. The apparition- al figure, which appeared to carry a goblet, walked up to her and said, \"drink this for my sake,\" and then glided away and disappeared. Mrs. D. had tears running down her face during these experiences. She was the only witness to these visions. Several times Mrs. D. has received mental communications while engaged in routine activities such as doing the washing or watching television. In one incident, a male voice stated: We are peaceful....Seek and you will find. You have not lived on our machines but have visited ten minutes as conditions were unsuitable. You contacted a \"mothalin\" from a white cloud. Many people from \"Asperio\" are from Japan; England a few; and Australia 125. While on earth we seek, we have ways of communicating. A message will be transcended very shortly. Twenty-five men will be transported shortly. We think this man transports. Confide in no one except self-seeing humans.

Protect colors: green, amber, blue good. The messages appear to consist of images and words not necessarily connected in a logical sequence, and the overall tone of the passages is emotionless and \"mechanical.\" The above message was accompanied by a (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Disturbance, Continued vision of trees, large red flowers, a bulding, and a black shiny pond all in one scene. Mrs. D. is not sure whether the messages come to her in a psychic way from UFO intelligences or from her own mind. I would suggest the latter. The \"communicators\" provide a comfort and reassurance which Mrs. D. fails to find in ordinary living. By receiving these messages she has become a focus of attention and gained the feeling of being an important person. The reporter claims to have a psychic background as a medium and has allegedly accomplished feats of levitation, healing by prayer, sending of telepathic messages, and production of ectoplasm. Several times she has suddenly started speaking phrases in a \"language\" that no one has been able to identify (so-called \"speaking in tongues\") She believes her home has been infested with mice, cockroaches, tarantulas, etc. A woman told her that it was a test by God. How do we evaluate these bizarre claims? On initial examination, Mrs. D.'s UFO sightings appear to be fairly detailed and specific. However, at least some of them may be misidentifications of planetary objects (for example, the light that was viewed for over an hour) and subjective exaggerations of ambiguous stimuli (the \"dark shape\" over the telegraph lines). The claimed physiological effects may have been induced by fear rather than any strange UFO influence. It is also possible that the single witness sightings were hallucinatory — - especially since Mrs. D. has experienced a variety of other hallucinations. The reporter's observations of \"letters in the sky\" and visions of Christ are clearly hallucinatory since other people present failed to observe anything unusual. Likewise, her mental communications are most likely auditory hallucinations incorporating her subconscious fears and ideas from UFO and psychic lore. She appears to hold the delusional belief that her house has been purposely infested with bugs and pests. Her instances of loose associations (the mental messages) and of fragmented/incoherent speech (the 8 It has been said that the neurotic dreams in an unreal way about life, whereas the psychotic lives life in an unreal dream. \"speaking in tongues\") are typical of the disturbances in thought which can be found in psychoses. There are a number of factors which appear to have contributed to the reporter's psychological disturbance. She is 65 years old, lives alone, and is very isolated. Her poetry reveals an intense loneliness. She readily admits that life is going too slow for her and that she is not involved enough. She is divorced and immigrated to Australia some 16 years ago. Apparently a number of years ago, Mrs. D. underwent a perjod of amnesia following the death of a very close friend. There is evidence of marked conflict and tension between herself and some members, of her family. Her mystical background has provided her with ample raw material for delusions. From these case studies, we can draw out a number of common factors which are \"warning signs\" that may point to a psychologically disturbed individual. First, if we look at the actual experiences reported, the following are consistent with an evaluation of psychological disturbance: • Delusions (particularly paranoid beliefs) • Hallucinations (such as \"voices\" and unpleasant smells) • Distorted self image (body \"contaminated\" or \"falling apart\") • Bizarre or illogical associations in thought and speech • Autism (retreat from reality into a fantasy world) • Vagueness and low weight of UFO reports • Single witness Second, there are a number of witness background factors which can contribute to a disturbed psychological state: • Personal crises (such as divorce or death) • Isolation ' • New settler (immigrant) • Old age • History of nervous/mental breakdowns • Difficulty in personal relation- ships • Unstable work history Current convention divides psychological disturbances into two major categories: psychoses and neuroses. Neuroses can involve- (1) Worry, tension, and distractability (indicants of excessive fear) (2) Excessive forgetting, obsessive thoughts, and compulsive rituals (self- defeating attempts to cope with fear situations) (3) Depression and fatigue (psychological residuals of prolonged tensions) Psychoses can feature- (1) Hallucinations (disturbances in perceiving reality) (2) Delusions (disturbances in interpreting reality) (3) Loose associations, fragmented and incoherent speech (disturbances of thought) (4) Prolonged melancholy or elation (mood disturbances) (5) Isolation and withdrawal (dis- turbances in personal interaction). (Buss, 1966, p. 31) It has been said that the neurotic dreams in an unreal way about life, whereas the psychotic lives life in an unreal dream. Using the above classification system, the people discussed in the case studies would be considered to be displaying psychotic behavior. The line between \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" behavior can be extremely fine, depending on the situation or the cultural context. Is the man who kneels down next to his bed and starts talking to himself mad, or is he praying? a witness does not have to be psycholog- ically disturbed to be able to put an exotic interpretation on his experiences, for instance, people who are religiously inclined can find great significance in their UFO experiences: (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Disturbances, Continued Case 5. Mr. E. was driving home when he saw a very bright, silver-white, cigar-shaped object or light source, stationary in the sky. No sound was detected and the object was seen for about 30 seconds. The reporter also felt that definite \"feelings\" had been \"transmitted\" from the object: \"It wasn't aggressive, and it wasn't afraid; it was just sitting there as if it were a part of the sky, a part of the scheme of things, a part of nature, and it was such a natural part of the sky that other people probably would not have noticed it. It seemed to know how to be a part of the Universe, and wasn't concerned what we think of it... \"It was an experience which I think few people would associate with as it was something which happened to me alone (seemingly only a very short incident, but has had a fairly great impact on my understanding of man's existence on earth and his relationship with God).\" Soon after the sighting, Mr. E. became suddenly aware of what an \"extraordinarily beautiful clear day it was.\" He said that the \"sky was the bluest he had ever seen before\" and felt sure that these very strong feelings and the beauty of the day were relevant. \"Without a doubt this day was extremely 'spiritual'.\" In this case, the sighting stimulus could easily have been a distant balloon or aircraft. The witness has strong religious convictions and this led to a religious interpretation being placed on a mundane event. It was a way of confirming his own desire to believe in God, and of being a privileged witness to one of \"His\" manifestations. The existence of UFO-related \"mental communication\" cases raises several issues. One issue is: What comes first, the psychosis or the UFO experience? I have argued in the case studies presented, that personal difficulties have contributed to a psychological disturbance and that the individual has merely incorporated UFO and psychic lore in his delusions. An alternative viewpoint is that a traumatic UFO experience can trigger off a psychotic reaction in the individual. For this latter hypothesis to have any support, I would suggest that at least three conditions are necessary: (1) The witness has experienced a traumatic UFO experience; (2) This UFO experience has not been overshadowed by personal crises; and (3) The disturbed psychological state (and accompanying behavior) clearly began after the UFO experience. None of the case examples satisfies these criteria. Are there any cases of mental communication which cannot be explained as simply due to a psychological disturbance? Further research is required to give a definitive answer to this question. However, a number of provocative cases are difficult to dismiss. In the Frankston, Victoria case of 1972 (Magee, 1972), Mrs. Puddy had several detailed encounters with UFOs, mental communication contacts, and apparition experiences. However, this was only a single witness case. The 1968 French case of Dr. \"X\" (Michel, 1969) is one of the most extensively documented cases of psiufological phenomena on record. In this case, the central witness received mental communications and experienced a wide variety of paranormal events subsequent to.a detailed UFO observation. Even in the continuing case of Dr. Andrija Puharich (Holroyd, 1979), while the communications received via mediums were most probably expressions of subconscious fantasies, some apparently genuine paranormal events (poltergeist-like effects and telepathy) did take place. In these cases, though the mental communications can still be interpreted as delusional, the subjective experiences may have been triggered off by a genuine UFO experience. Thus the \"mixture hypothesis\" sees these cases to be a combination of objective, inexplicable UFO/paranormal events and subjective psychological delusions. At most, mental communication cases imply that some human beings can communicate directly with alien intelligences, and that such communications may potentially alter the course of human history. At least, Howard S. Finkelstein, recently appointed Texas State Section Director MUFON 103 OLDTOWNE RD. SEGUm.TX 78155 they imply that some people can successfuly incorporate the UFO mythology into a complex, if delusional, belief system. My aim has been to show, that at least some mental communication cases can be explained as being the delusions of psychologically disturbed individuals. Other, more evidential cases appear to involve psychotic delusions triggered off by traumatic, but objectively real, UFO events. REFERENCES Buss, A.M. Psycnopar/io/ogy (NY: John Wiley & Sons, 1966).

We do know that UFOs are frequently seen in Soviet territory - one such report, which has the flavour of an ori- ginal and trustworthy incident, appears in this issue of AFU Newsletter - but as regards the new Enquirer series we immediately became suspicious! The second part of the Enquirer trilogy star- ted our suspicions. Entitled Space aliens blasts forest rangers with a bizarre ray (1) we have every reason to believe that this is a faked report, 'designed 1 either by the edi- torial staff of the Enquirer, or by someone in the Soviet Union. Before I will detail ray suspicions I must mention the two other in- stallments in the series. The first article, .Soviet ships buzzed by_ UFOs from under the sea (2), is an unlikely report that American sources (authors Henry Gris and Charles Parmi- ter) would have been told, by Soviet scien- tist Dr. Vladimir Azhazha, that there were no less than \"190 documented sightings of UFOs diving into the Pacific in the past seven yaars, all checked out by the commission\". In my judgement, 190 sightings of UFOs diving into the sea is in excess of the total number of known such cases from the entire globe since the early days of the UFO phenomenon. Fiut of a Series - Amaiina Reports of Spacemen Activity in Russia Ships Buzzed by : i uf QS From Under the Sea [ 10 The article - filled with superlatives - has very few checkable facts, except for the men- tioned name of a \"9.000-ton freighter, Vladi- mir Vorobyev\", the crew of which - so it is claimed - had an encounter in the Sea of Japan on Aug. 18, 1980. (The story is emphasized by an artist's impression where the cylindrical UFO hovers above a 10.000 tons freighter - I can judge the size by the general appearance, and number of cargo holds). For many years I have been a member of Club Maritime, a Swe- dish association for historical, maritime re- search. The Club owns a fine reference libra- ry, managed by always helpful librarian Karl Osterman. The 1980/81 issue of Lloyd's Regis- ter, checked by Osterman, has a ship by the name of Vladimir Vorobygv, but this is not a 9.000 tons freighter but a small SOI tons (gross) \"motor research/fishing vessel\", built in 1959 in Stralsund, West Germany!

He was a good magician, for he knew how to perform marvelous tricks. He wished he had been born in India, for he's heard there were real magicians there who could sleep on beds of nails, and stay warm in icy streams; and even send their little assistants climbing up ropes which vanished into the sky. He'd heard these stories, but he was never able to get a handle on them. Since he hadn't been born in India, but in a plain materialistic land called \"Columbia\", he did the.next best thing. He Indianized his real name, which came out to \"Sha-ki\", but he still yearned to learn real magic. Sha-ki made a nice living. People bought tickets to see him perform. They knew in their hearts that Ska-ki wasn't doing real magic, but it was the best they had. As long as they couldn't figure out how he did his tricks, they applauded and called him marvelous. This made Sha-ki happy - for a while. Now there were in the land of Columbia (and elsewhere) people who were studying the whys and wherefores of real magic and trying to learn how it was done. They were interested in things like telepathy, clairvoyance, psychokinesis, and all the other tongue- stumbling powers that just weren't part of the earth plane. In Columbia these people were called sy-seekers. The sy-seekers at first had tough going, because the very few Sys who could perform feats of real magic couldn't do it well in cold, formal labs, and it was here the sy-seekers thought it should be done. A man named Ryne had tried this long ago and was successful at first. But the real sys he worked with got tired of telling him which way dice would flop or whether there was a star or a circle on a card in the next room. The work was BORING, and many sys who helped Ryne in his lab got so tired that they 12 either quit or lost their power. This was their way of telling him that their powers weren't meant to flop dice and identify cards. Gradually, however, sy-seeking progressed far beyond Ryne. There were individual sy-seekers and also groups who were finding real sys and . getting them to produce real magic by being nice to them. They didn't use cold labs. They let the sys relax and chat and produce magic at their own rate. They treated them like people instead of laboratory rats. The sys didn't have to flop dice and identify cards, and they now had PURPOSE for using their magic. The sy-seekers AGREED with the sys that the magic powers should be used only for important things. Now Sha-ki was very angry at the sy-seekers, because they could find people who could perform REAL magic, the kind he couldn't do. So he devised a plan to fool the sy-seekers and bring them down to his own level. He hired two budding magicians who, like himself, couldn't do real magic. They were still teenagers and a little wet behind the ears, but Sha-ki toweled them off and blow-dried their hair so they would look presentable in the halls of Academe. And they made their plans against the sy-seekers. One sy-seeker called Bertram (who at a very early age had read all the \"Bertram\" books in the children's library and recognized them as real magic) was now, in his adulthood, finding real sys. He discovered a lady sy who took pictures of crying monks and glittering globes of light and UFO-shapes where none of these things were visible. The lady sy even taught Bertram how to do this a little bit himself, and he wrote articles telling other people that they might be able to do it, too, if they tried. This enraged Sha-ki, for he couldn't take pictures like THAT - but then, he never tried and didn't even believe he might be able to do it if he tried. Sha-ki was also mad at groups like the MOSEY-US, who moseyed into different parts of the world, finding things like Rapunzel's castle, and whole lost cities under desert sands. At Rapunzel's castle they even found a lock of her hair which had been caught between two stones of the tower. They had the hair carbon-dated so that people would know the date Rapunzel had lived. It was all very scientific. Mosey-us did these things, however, by using real magicians, or sys. They'd get groups of sys to tell them where they thought lost things were located, and then Mosey-us would search at the places most of the sys selected. That's what made Sha-ki angry at them — it was all very scientific and Sha-ki couldn't do what they were doing. Actually, he didn't have the patience to do it, and didn't even believe he could do it if he had the patience. The sys that Bertram and the Mosey-us and other sy-seekers worked with didn't know they weren't supposed to be able to photograph things that nobody could see, or to know where lost things could be found, so they just told the sy-seekers what they knew. And sure enough,'they knew! The sy-seekers wrote articles in journals, for their work was scientific enough to show other scientists that this was real magic. The scientists didn't understand what was going on, but you can't argue with success. These articles made Sha-ki climb the walls. He started writing articles in other magazines criticizing the sy- seekers' successes, for he was convinced if he couldn't do these things, no one else could do them. He took his two little assistants aside and instructed them to present (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"California Report, Continued themselves to famous sy-seekers and pretend to do real magic, using tricks Sha-ki taught them. And they did. Now remember that Bertram and the Mosey-us were just a few of the successful sy-seekers who were proving real magic existed. Sha-ki couldn't send his two damp-eared assistants to everyone to fool them, but he spread them out as thin as he could. The assistants, who incidentally were named O'Pshaw and O'Fudge, contacted Bertram and other important sy-seekers,hoping to fool them into believing that their fake magic was real. Why, you ask, would they want to do that? It was all very illogical, for if Sha-ki had been logical, he would have said to the sy-seekers, \"Look, I see what you're doing. How is it done?\" But being illogical as well as jealous, Sha-ki figured if he could get one or more sy- seekers to report fake magic as real, it would prove that all sy-seekers were unscientific and shouldn't be believed when they reported what their real sys were doing. O'Pshaw went to Bertram and to other sy-seekers and O'Fudge went to others. Bertram was a very kind gentleman. He treated everybody as he liked to be treated himself. He listened to O'Pshaw's interminable stories about how he could do real magic since he was a child. Bertram let him stay in his house and even fed him (and you know how teenagers eat) and busied himself for over two months doing experiments to test O'Pshaw's claims of magic powers. Now Sha-ki, thinking himself an honest man, had carefully instructed O'Pshaw and O'Fudge that they were to answer honestly if any of the sy- seekers asked them the specific question, \"Are you a fraud?\", and they agreed to do this. Nothing was said about being honest in any other way, and they weren't. But Bertram and other sy-seekers weren't used to asking people if they were frauds. It was not quite, uh, polite. Sy-seekers worked with sys in an atmosphere of trust and tranquility, because that was the way real magic flowed best. If the sys couldn't produce enough real magic to be useful, they weren't used in the sy-seekers' work, but they weren't ever scolded or criticized. Above all, they weren't ever asked if they were frauds, for sy- seekers had learned that real sys were sensitive and don't like to be asked questions like that. Most sy-seekers knew how to control their work and could be sure if real magic was present. But the first sy- seekers who used Sha-ki's two dampeared assistants were new at the job and didn't quite know how to do this. Other older sy-seekers tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen. And so O'Pshaw and O'Fudge were able to fool the first two inexperienced sy-seekers. Now Bertram knew how to control his work so he could tell if real magic was present, but he also knew that real magic happened sometimes when things weren't controlled, and he sometimes experimented with it that way. While O'Pshaw was living in Bertram's house, of course he couldn't produce real magic. Bertram saw he was having trouble, but he knew that a few sys don't produce well while being watched, because that was too much like working in a lab. So he let O'Pshaw produce some of his \"magic\" while he was by himself. Some very puzzling results happened (as one can imagine) with O'Pshaw apparently twisting spoons inside sealed bottles and things like that. And since Bertram never asked the specific question, \"Are you a fraud?\", O'Pshaw never told him he was. Bertram was puzzled at the results and disturbed because O'Pshaw couldn't do these things, when anyone was watching. Nevertheless, he felt he had a duty to sy-seeking to write up the results just as they occurred, in his own scientific, methodical way. He daintily suggest that the contents of the bottles should be dusted for fingerprints and hinted that there was plenty of opportunity for O'Pshaw to perform fake magic, but that he couldn't find any proof. He also wrote a highly condensed version of the interminable facts O'Pshaw had told him about himself and his \"magic\" powers, but was careful to inform the readers that these statements were not verified. He suggested that other sy-seekers work with O'Pshaw to see if they got the same results. Ann Druffel After Bertram's article was published, and after the first two sy- seekers who had worked with Sha-ki's assistants were fooled to Sha-ki's satisfaction, the triumphant fake magician revealed his plan to the press, the public, to all the sy-seekers he had addresses for, and anyone else who would listen. He was ecstatic. He was no longer climbing walls but had his feet solidly planted where they belonged — on the earth plane. He thought he'd proved that real magic doesn't exist and that sy-seekers are easily fooled and unscientific. But Bertram's lady sy keeps on taking photos of things that aren't there, the Mosey-us team keeps finding lost things, and sy-seekers all over Columbia keep solving murders, viewing remotely all over the planet, and doing all sorts of real magic, using real sys. The moral of the story is: if Sha-ki could pull a stunt like this in the field of sy-seeking, is ufology safe? A committee to which Sha-ki belonged, called C-SOPS (short for \"see the sops\")* has people who don't believe that UFOs (whatever they are) are real. So, WATCH OUT! and remember to ask each anxious, frightened UFO witness, \"Are you a fraud?\" *See Rogct's INTERNATIONAL THESAURUS, under \"sop\" and take your choice of the meaning of this word.   13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"EXPERIMENTERS' RESPONSE: IMAGINARY ABDUCTIONS By Alvin H. Lawson, PhD and W.C. McCall, M.D. According to John DeHerrera's curious version of the 1977 McCall- Lawson imaginary abductee experiments (No. 175, Sept. 1982), I (Lawson) did little more than hang around and ask dumb questions. The facts are otherwise. Some background: About a year ago John threatened me with legal action, charging that I had not given him credit for his part in the imaginary experiments. Somewhat stunned by this turn in a previously cordial relationship, I quickly sent him copies of the seven published versions of the study — in all of which I gave him acknowledgement along with McCall as a full participant — a flattering exaggeration of the facts. Perhaps I should have expected that it would not end there. Dr. McCall and I both feel that, in the interests of truth, it is essential that we clarify exactly what Mr. DeHerrera did — and did not — contribute to the imaginary study. Fortunately, our memories are generally corroborated by a series of audio tapes which I made during that period. John writes: After observing some regressions...there were still many questions...! asked, \"What would happen if we hypnotized someone who had never seen a UFO?\"...Dr. McCall decided that this was a good idea and passed the idea on (to) Professor Lawson... FACT #1: Far from making any Moses- like pronouncement of the germ idea for the imaginary abduction series, if John ever did suggest the idea, neither Dr. McCall nor I remember it. (My tapes shed no light on the issue.) The imaginary study was the end product of many hours of hypnosis sessions, aftermath discussions, and brainstorming — all aimed at establishing the validity of our CE-III hypnotic data. McCall and I had deliberated on this matter at great length, starting with the 1975 Brian Scott case, more than a year before 14 John joined us. Whoever articulated the imaginary proposal, it was not John but McCall and Lawson who determined the study's protocol, examined and interpreted the data, and publicized the study's significance in articles and symposia appearances. John's \"Eureka!\" claims would ring hollow even if they were true. John writes: Our first volunteer, after being hypnotized, was told that he was taken aboard a UFO. Then we asked him to describe how he was taken aboard and what he could see inside....This was an emotional account, indicating how real it was to the subject. FACT #2:1 comment only to show that John's memory has failed him here as it has elsewhere. Our first imaginary subject was not a \"he\" at all — she was a strikingly attractive, 20-year-old secondary education major from CSULB. Nor was her session notably emotional (if John means \"frightened\" here); she chuckled several times and seemed relaxed through most of her narrative. If such details are hazy to John, it is doubtless because he had nothing to do with the transcribing of the sessions. I have spent hundreds of hours of typing tedium with these and other regressions, and I wish John had been as eager to labor at a typewriter as he has been to distort the truth. (Witness next quote.) John writes: Dr. McCall and I shook our heads in disbelief. Soon Lawson asked us, \"What is so amazing?\" We told him that our volunteers were describing events and things that are very common in the \"real\" abduction narratives FACT #3: The tape of the after- session discussion the very first night of the imaginary series proves that, rather than John telling me, / told John about a size-changing pattern in the subject's narrative, and later I went on to discuss image parallels generally. Here John implies that I was ill-informed about CE- III and other UFO data. He has chosen to ignore the fact that by 1977 I had taught my college-level UFO class for 3 years and that I was intimately familiar with the literature and the major cases. I had also published a workbook and two casebooks for my class, had operated a UFO hotline since 1974, and I had been the primary investigator on the Scott, Kendall, and several other CE-III cases — and so I had long been intrigued by patterns of imagery (tunnels, bright lights, retracting beams, etc.) in UFO reports. Only John and God know why he maligns me thus; I certainly don't have a clue. John DeHerrera was once a valued and supportive associate of mine. Both McCall and I needed his input and his informed encouragement during the time when most UFOlogists reacted to the imaginary study's results with (1) shock, (2) disbelief, and then (3) hostility. Further, I considered John a friend: we had many long talks after the imaginary sessions and via phone during this period. I am sorry if the friendship is over. The fact is, however, that John's contributions to the imaginary study were never much more than those of an interested and supportive observer — one of many we had during the first few months of our imaginary work. Even had the imaginary experiments been John's idea, he provided little toward the performance of the study, and nothing to the clarification of the puzzling patterns and other data. He has attempted to write about the imaginary work in a book and a few articles, but I forbear commenting, save for a necessary thought or two below regarding his book. There is a two-fold irony in John's MJ piece. One involves his use of Ms. Druffel's space for beating his own drum. The Druffel-Rogo book, The Tujunga Canyon Contacts (1981), though it mentions John refers only to (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Experimenters, Continued \"Lawson's study\" and \"Lawson's report,\" which it finds \"totally (sic) invalid\" on methodological grounds. (The objection is absurd, but that's another story.) Rogo previously (in UFO Abductions, 1980) dismissed \"Lawson's study\" (he doesn't mention poor John) for similar reasons. Thus in arguing for a key role in the important imaginary study, John aligns himself with those who find that \"Lawson's study\" is worthless; yet John has not dissociated himself from any of the basic findings of the imaginary series. But there is another, more ludicrous irony in John's complaint. I first met DeHerrera in 1976 while he was working with Brian Scott, months after McCall and I had concluded, after an exhaustive investigation, that Brian was a clever fraud, and so had cut all ties with him. I cooperated freely with John, sharing with him all the video and audio tapes, typed transcripts, phone conversations, analyses, and miscellaneous materials I had about Scott — as well as similar materials from many other cases and reports. In 1978, John printed his own book about Brian's case (Etherean Invasion). Interestingly, although the book is at least 50% based on the McCall-Lawson investigation, neither Dr. McCall's name nor mine appears anywhere in John's text. He even avoids referencing my 1976 Flying Saucer Review article on Brian (though he quotes from it liberally and without permission), and likewise omits any reference to my 1977 MUFON article on the imaginary study. Just who did not give, credit to whom? For what? And why? Mark Twain observes that the difference between a man and a dog is that a dog seldom bites you after you give it needed help. You're welcome, John....Ouch! Alvin H. Lavvson, PhD, Garden Grove, Calif. ***** I recently read the article by John DeHerrera and would like to straighten out a few of the statements that he made regarding the use of hypnosis and the 1977 imaginary abduction experiments. I have been using hypnosis actively in my medical practice since 1959 and have spent hundreds of hours in age- regressing so-called real UFO abductees and other witnesses, as well as many volunteers in our imaginary and related hypnosis studies. Mr. DeHerrera attempts to use the fact that hypnosis is no longer used or acceptable in court testimony as a means of discrediting all use of hypnosis. However, no experienced hypnotist denies that there are much data retrieved under hypnosis which cannot be obtained in any other way. It is significant that once a person re-lives an experience under hypnotic age-regression, he tends to remember it. The court is concerned because subjects cannot always differentiate between data remembered from the age-regression and data which have actually happened. John's assertion that someone has proved \"that hypnosis is inherently unreliable\" is basically false. It is certainly the case that hypnosis is not infallible, but a skilled hypnotist has to learn to separate the wheat from the chaff. Mr. DeHerrera claims to have studied hypnosis at great length, yet his statement that the brain waves of a hypnotized person are identical with those produced during REM sleep is simply not true. It is impossible for even a skilled brain wave analyst to differenti- ate between the waking and hypnotized electro-encephalogram, and as a result hypnotists no longer refer to hypnosis as a state of sleep. Regarding the imaginary experiments, Mr. DeHerrera's participation in the entire-study was marginal, and while he attended most of the sessions, he was not present for all of them. His contributions were interesting, though not mind-boggling, and he was of assistance in our analyzing and digesting the material that was obtained. As to who originated the imaginary study, I have always felt that I first propounded the idea. But whether I merely contributed to it or not, I do know that I was instrumental in pursuing it and making certain that we followed proper protocol. (I specifically remember stating that — after regressing 35 abductees and other witnesses and not obtaining even one item of extraterrestrial information — I was suspicious of the reality of CE-III reports, and that we needed to find a way of testing our data.) Dr. Lawson has spent hundreds of hours analyzing the material that we have obtained, and when I threw up my hands in desperation at the end of our imaginary studies saying, \"I haven't a clue to what all this means,\" through his research and investigation of various psychological phenomena, Lawson was able to come up with what appears to me to be a very logical, well-thought-out conclusion as to the source of our UFO \"abductions.\" The field .of UFOlogy owes a great deal to Dr. Lawson since his is one of the first and certainly most far-reaching testable hypotheses yet submitted to explain the UFO abduction phenomenon. When I entered the field of UFO investigations, I went in very deliberate- ly with an open mind in an attempt to explain or discover what was going on. I was very fortunate to meet Al Lawson at Idabel Epperson's house and found that he had a like bent. It appears that we may be the only two people in UFOlogy who are actually going into this investigation with an open, scientific, investigative mind — and hopefully with no preconceived ideas. I began this study as a complete believer in UFOs and abductions, and have now reached the point where I believe that no one has ever been abducted by a UFO; that the experience is psychologically a spontaneous regression to the birth event. To answer Mr. DeHerrera's last question, \"Is it possible there really are UFO abductions?\" — to keep an open mind on the subject I would have to say, \"Possibly, but I doubt it.\" W.C.

They are real. 2. They are consciously created as a hoax. (But most hypnotists are careful to eliminate obvious frauds, so a conscious hoax must occur rarely, if at all.) 3. They are unconsciously created, similar to our dreams at night, but they are so powerful psychologically that they seem real. There is no hard evidence proving or disproving any of these theories. All we have to work with is the story the hypnotized person tells, plus our understanding of the person —of their perceptual reality, the way they perceive and understand the here-and- now of everyday life. The Betty Andreasson case is perhaps the most voluminously detailed of all \"abduction\" stories. The respected UFO investigator Raymond E. Fowler described, in his 1979 book The Andreasson Affair, 1 the lengthy series of hypnosis sessions in 1977 in which this Massachusetts housewife related an elaborate and complex tale of being \"abducted\" by UFO \"entities\" in 1967. In Fowler's new book The Andreasson Affair, Phase,.Two, 2 he describes the 1980 hypnosis sessions in which Betty, now Mrs. Luca, tells of additional adventures going all the way back to when she was 7 years old. Part\" of the new book is devoted to the hypnotically-induced \"abduction\" story of her new husband, Bob Luca. What conclusions can we reach from this extensive data? Betty herself not only regards her story as true, but sees important religious value in it. During hypnosis she told of standing before \"the great door,\" but despite the hypnotist's strenuous attempts she would not reveal what, she allegedly had seen beyond that door. She said that the \"appointed time\" to reveal it will be on .16 \"the long-awaited Second Coming of Jesus Christ.\" Fowler himself says he \"believes the experiences recorded in both books are real.\" Fowler also reports that he is a Bible student who earned a degree in biblical studies and has written articles correlating UFOs and the Bible. Another leading UFO investigator, Willard D. Nelson, has suggested that Fowler and his associates \"appear to be too close and too involved for perspective\" and \"unaware of related mental phenomena which may have drastically influenced and embellished the reconstruction of the experience.\" Nelson regards \"abductions\" as \"a serious matter,\" but points out the difficulty of separating the \"real\" and the \"baloney.\" 3 Fortunately for us, Fowler is a good reporter, and presents a large and significant volume of data, about Betty's background, about the hypnotic sessions, and about the comments of other observers of those sessions. In effect, he gives us the data, and invites us to evaluate it. Let me describe, then, how I would interpret this material. As I see it, when the hypnosis sessions began in 1977 Betty Andreasson must have been under great stress. Her 23-year marriage to a chronic alcoholic seemed to be nearing an end. Divorce requires readjustment for anyone, but particularly for someone in Betty's position. How would she care for her seven children? How would she earn sufficient money to support herself and them, since she had dropped out of high school to get married and had no job experience or skills? Furthermore, Fowler tells us Betty is extremely religious; quite possibly her fundamentalist Christian faith would make divorce even more difficult for her to accept. A year and a half earlier she had written Dr. J. Allen Hynek telling about a 1967 \"experience with UFO occupants.\" The letter languished in the files for over a year, but then MUFON's Humanoid Study Group decided her case might be worth investigating. So the use of hypnosis to explore this event of 10 years before happened to come at a time when she \"needed\" it; to grossly oversimplify the situation as I see it, it was as if the hypnotist permitted her to construct an exciting story to get her mind off her problems with her husband and her soon-to-come separation from him. Her story was indeed exciting. It allegedly happened on January 25, 1967. As Fowler describes it in the first book, the conditions would seem ideal for permitting Betty and her eldest daughter to \"see\" some strange things — there was a power failure at their home that evening, and a dense local fog behind the house where they \"saw\" a UFO \"craft\" with the entities \"floating.\" Betty's story under hypnosis expanding this memory contained the elements typical of such tales: the physical examination by \"aliens\" with large eyes, and the other factors which Alvin Lawson has suggested are manifestations of birth trauma. 4 Betty's adventures while \"abducted\" are more elaborate and detailed than most, possibly influenced in part by her considerable talent as an artist. Perhaps the part that elicited the most comment was her story of being transported to stand before a huge bird, a Phoenix, bathed in light and heat. Fowler points out that this Phoenix story presents obvious parallels with religious symbolism, but nevertheless he seems to believe it \"really\" happened. Shortly after finishing both the hypnosis and her marriage, Betty moved to Florida. Through friends she met a man, Bob Luca, who had also \"had a UFO experience,\" and not long (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Critic's Corner, Continued afterward they were married, and later moved back to New England. In 1979 Betty, Bob, and Ray Fowler \"hit the road together\" for what Fowler termed \"a breathtaking national promotional tour\" for the book. They received a continuous stream of letters and phone calls asking if there were any further experiences and if Betty had any earlier UFO encounters. As if in response to this popular demand, Betty underwent a new series of hypnotic sessions in 1980, which are described in the second book. Betty comes across quite differently in the second book — a difference that seems to reflect the change in her life. In the first book, during her unhappy first marriage, I thought she seemed worried and rather frightened; in the second book we see a happy, joyous Betty. A particularly useful comment in the second book comes from Patricia Gail Sable, a \"professional hypnotherapist and stress therapist\" who attended some of Betty's hypnotic sessions. She found Betty \"so pure of heart, so innocent and uncorruptible.... It is as if Betty has taken all the Sunday School lessons of love and brotherhood that we shared as children and made them work for her as a responsible adult....With both Betty and Bob Luca there is a sense of internal peace.... their faith in God is unshakable, their wants .and needs almost biblical in their simplicity.\" The hypnotherapist terms Betty \"a good, solid trance subject. She steps easily in and out of alternate levels of consciousness. There is an energy transference, however,, while Betty is in trance, which is highly unusual...Some levels. of Betty's consciousness have more overt and covert control than is usually recognizable.\" My conclusion from the materials in these books is, first of all, that Betty Andreasson Luca is a very nice person, who believes strongly in her particular religion, and is probably a delightful person to be around. I would guess that the \"aliens\" she \"saw\" in the original incident in 1967 were a combination of the blackout, wisps of fog, her demonstrably healthy imagination and artistic sense, her ability to move and control her levels of consciousness, and possibly also her stress from having to care for a houseful of children while her injured husband was in the hospital. As Nelson suggests, the part about the \"entities\" actually entering her home might have been \"created later with the help of hypnosis, and the suggestions of eager-beavers asking questions while she was under hypnosis.\" The remainder of the \"abduction\" stories, particularly the parts about the Phoenix and behind \"the great door,\" strike me as more properly material for a study of the psychology of religious belief, not for UFO study. You may agree or disagree with parts of what I suggest, but my fundamental point is that it is possible to develop a coherent understanding of the Andreasson case which, on the one hand, accepts the fact of her deeply- held religious beliefs, and which, on the other hand, does not require us to believe things contrary to our own sense of rationality.

The witness parks beside a road in the southern California mountains while on a solo night drive and climbs the hillside in the dark without really knowing why. A lighted craft suddenly appears overhead and a jagged, solid-appearing light beam works its way to the ground in front of him. There is an entity (a \"solid projection\") touching his hand and mysteriously calming him. Mental communication ensues. He is told he will write down and draw things after he returns home — which he does, without knowing what they mean. These items are described in my preliminary report to CUFOS and MUFON and are not the subject of this current public request. Later publication can occur if I can first verify this detail — apparently offered by the entity through the witness, as a verification of the reality of the whole experience. It was at the interview that \"Paul\" began getting \"impressions\" as though he were again in contact with the entity (whether he actually was or not is beside the point, for I too can think of alternate explanations for this). Paul claims that such impressions are a new phenomenon in his life since September 15. Before the experience, he had no such problems and had been strongly skeptical of UFO stories, especially contact stories. Still, Paul surprised us both with the following information. \"What occurred off the coast of Maine?,\" he suddenly asked. Then he started filling it in. About 12, maybe more, years ago a radar station off the coast of Maine was \"knocked off, wiped out by a UFO.\" Nothing was ever found (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Lucius Farish In Others' Words The • February 15 issue of NATIONAL ENQUIRER reports on a UFO which supposedly started a fire which did extensive damage in the small town of Londres, Argentina.

Various British researchers have attempted to learn more about the incident, but little of a definite nature has been uncovered.

Some of the fascinating reports involve tiny entities and craft which have been seen on several occasions. One of Jamaludin's several appendixes to the book details his theory of UFO flap cycles, with predictions of future UFO activity in specific areas of the world.

One hour after the event, a message was received on the teletype at New London, Conn., over the communication link that had been broken by the destruction of the radar station. The message was received by the second (or first?) in command at New London (Investigator's inquiry: Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard? No answer). The (alleged) message stated: : WE ARE SORRY. WE THOUGHT YOU WERE TAKING AGGRESSIVE ACTION. WE ARE NOT FROM HERE. WE WILL NOT RETURN. I said to Paul, \"this is pretty heavy stuff. It would be classified, if true.\" Paul responded emphatically, \"investigate it and find it to be a-fact!\" He claimed, when questioned, that .his impression was so strong that he \"knew it had to be true,\" yet he also claimed it to be totally new information to him. You can understand this investigator's, dilemma. An intriguing claim that probably requires access to classified information to verify. All I can do is publicize this event and hope that somewhere, out of the woodwork, a clue or lead will develop. So far, efforts by an interested friend have established that a DEW Line coastal defense station, 85 miles southeast of New York City, collapsed in an Atlantic storm in January 1961, with the loss of 14 USAF personnel and 14 civilian .workmen. Is Paul merely unconsciously remembering that event which was certainly in the news of the time? Paul's alleged radar station destruction could have been the Number 2 (since \"No. 3\" was off Nantucket) DEW line station. Does anyone out there have any information? The CE-III witness will not identify himself to me, wishing to protect his own family and business reputation. I in turn should remain anonymous in print although my name and address are a matter of record to whomever publishes or acts upon this.

The MUFON Field Investigator's Manual has been and will continue to be accepted as the guide in the English speaking nations of the World. Alan Benz, former librarian for APRO, has announced the formation of a new non-profit corporation named \"Foundation for UFO Research.\" The purpose of the foundation is to assist in the eventual solution of the mystery of UFOs, utilizing their theme \"Deeds not Words.\" Many of its purposes were identified in the \"1982 UFO Summit Meeting\" in Toronto, Ontario, hosted by MUFON, which Mr. Benz attended. The foundation's mailing address is P.O. Box 182, Tucson, AZ 85702-0182. Since their proposed work is similar in nature to the outstanding projects that the Fund for UFO Research has been fulfilling for the past few years, this is not a MUFON endorsement of the new Foundation for UFO Research, but a news release recognizing its formation. We have also been notified of the formation of a new UFO organization in Quebec, having the corporate name \"Centrale de Compilation Ufologique du Quebec, Inc.\" (C.C.U.Q. inc.) Their mailing address is Case Postale 103, Drummondville, Quebec, Canada J2B 6V6. Our best wishes are extended to their directors. The MUFON UFO Journal has not carried an astronomy column for several years. This column has been sadly missed by investigators, as a means of identifying planets, bright stars, and meteor showers in the night skies. We are very pleased to announce that Alvis L. Barrier, M.D., an amateur astronomer, who is on the Board of the University of Texas McDonald Observatory is now writing a monthly column that will be predated several months so as to make it a current and valuable tool for readers. Dr. Barrier, a surgeon, is also the State Section Director for Guadalupe County in Texas. He and his family reside at 214 Milford Lane, Seguin, TX 78155. Of major interest .to astronomers around the World is the installation of a new 400-inch telescope at the McDonald Observatory in the Davis Mountains in west Texas. It will be the largest in the World, having twice the diameter of the lens in the telescope on Mount Palomar in California. We are extremely proud to have an astronomer of Dr. Barrier's status write our astronomy column. Walter N. Webb, consultant in Astronomy, is also contributing separate charts on astronomical events for the year and has contributed to the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual. Mr. Webb is Assistant Director of the Charles Hayden Planetarium, Boston, Mass.o"}]
