The only thing I have ever seen that I couldn't explain was simply a light that suddenly flicked on in the sky one night in the Ozark Mountains of southwestern Missouri at the tail end of a flap in 1977. It was a vividly bright, sharply defined circle of surprisingly pure white light no bigger than the end of a Flair pen. In maybe ten .seconds it dimmed instantly to a twentieth of its original brightness, while retaining its size and definition, and in another ten seconds it blinked out for good. It was startling but nothing spectacular, and certainly nothing to base a belief on. My belief comes, instead, from having interviewed some 1,300 people in a number of countries who said they had seen or encountered what could only be described as UFOs (and this doesn't count the many others who described what were obviously IFOs). In my first week as an investigative UFO reporter, in 1975,1 talked with 60 to 70 UFO witnesses, and I tried very hard to explain away what they had seen. I couldn't. My belief began then.. .and the many hundreds of reports I have investigated since then have only confirmed my original belief.

Scott Grain Jr., MUFON State Section Director, and Lynn Sanderson and Bruce Courier, investigators for the Pennsylvania Association for the Study of the unexplained. Included are some comments made by the aptness to Marsha Helm, a reporter for the Altoona (Pa.) Mirror. A Pennsylvania woman is being treated for injuries she says she suffered when a disc-shaped object raised her car up on two wheels as it passed over her while she was driving home on the evening of October 15, 1983. The incident occurred just north of Altoona during Pennsylvania's busiest flap since 1973 (No. 188, October 1983). \"I never want to see nothing like that again,\" said Catherine Burk, 67, a retired receptionist. \"I couldn't get control of the car.\" Mrs. Burk was returning to her home in the suburban community of Bellwood after visiting her daughter and her family in Altoona. The time was between 8:30 and 9 PM. She was driving her 1976 Chevrolet Malibu north on Route 220 and had slowed to about 35 miles an hour as she approached the turnoff to Bellwood when she heard a loud whirling sound to her right. \"It was a weird sound, real fast,\" she said. \"It was like a real fast hum, and it was sharp.\" She looked through the passenger window and saw a bright silvery saucer- shaped object coming toward her from the southeast. It was flat on top with a rounded protrusion underneath and r appeared to be about 24 feet in diameter. It was about 30 feet off the ground. \"It was bright silver with a pocket underneath,\" she said. \"It was really bright. It was big, really big \" (continued on next page) Catherine Burk describes sighting near Bellwood, Pennsylvania (Photo courtesy of Larry G. McKee, of Altoona, Pennsylvania)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Burk Case, Continued ' The object passed over the car, moving from right to her left. \"When he went over me, he took the right side of my car up,\" she said. She believes it was raised two to three feet off the highway. Mrs. Burk said she leaned toward the passenger's side to try to bring the car back down but she kept sliding back into the driver's seat. \"I couldn't get control of the car;\" she said. \"I was sliding over the seat.\" While this was happening, she said, she couldn't turn the steering wheel arid the car lights kept blinking on and off. Because she was fighting.to regain control of the car, she didn't see the object as it passed over her. Once the object had moved on to her left, the car righted itself. \"It came down with such a thud,\" she said, adding that she believes the car was in the air about three or four seconds. When the car did come down, Mrs. Burk was bounced hard against the dashboard and almost ended up under it. The engine stalled and she immediately pulled off the highway and stopped. She could see the object disappearing over a ridge to the northwest. She was quite frightened by the experience and sat for a while to regain her composure. Then she tried to start the car, but without success. She kept trying and after 20 to 25 minutes, the car started. •   • • . ; As she continued her trip home, the motor quit every time she had to stop. ..'•''• Mrs. Burk said she saw no other witnesses during the incident, although there was an older couple in front of a motel'near the site of the encounter. They had pulled off the highway and were looking up into the sky but she thinks they may been trying to read the motel sign. Later, their car passed hers as she returned home. Mrs. Burk had left her daughter's home about 7:50 PM and it was 9:45 PM when she finally got home. The trip normally takes 20 to 30 minutes, she said. She decided not to tell anybody about the incident because \"people think you're crazy.\" However, her daughter phoned to see if she had CfltHtfilfcE guRk arrived home safely and realized Mrs. Burk was upset. After Mrs. Burk told her what had happened, the daughter phoned the Bellwood police: Police Chief Gregory Ciaccio went to Mrs. Burk's home and talked with her. He reported \"she was visibly shaking,\" adding that she had not been drinking. Since the incident, Mrs. Burk has been undergoing treatment at Mercy Hospital in Altoona for a number of ailments, including a partial hearing loss in her right ear, and shoulder, chest and spinal problems. She was also suffering from severe headaches. The investigators found that Mrs. Burk is a very religious person who is active in her church. She seems to be honest and sincere. She said she does not read UFO books or watch UFO movies and she doesn't believe aliens are visiting earth. She doubts that what she saw was alien. She thinks it was something the government built. \"I always said the government was trying out stuff,\" she said. \"But I never want to see nothing like that again.\" The incident has left her frightened. \"It's just the idea that it was something I never saw before. I never was afraid to be by myself. I wouldn't have been scared if it hadn't raised the car up.\" The investigators are continuing to monitor Mrs. Burk's medical problems and determine what the object was. No other witnesses have been located. NEWS FLASH On January 6, 1984, the MUFON Metroplex Group voted not to host the 1984 MUFON UFO Symposium in Dallas, Texas, scheduled for June 8,9 and 10.

Swords, Ph.D. In a number of UFO occupant reports, the entities are said to look identical or at least very much alike. This has led to speculation that they may be clones. Here, at the request of International Director Walt Andrus, a scientist takes a look at the subject of cloning and its possible application to ufology. The author is Dr. Michael Swords, a member of the faculty in the science department at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, and a newly appointed consultant in science for MUFON. Close encounters, abductions, and government-sequestered ufonaut bodies naturally excite everyone interested in the UFO phenomenon. Lately, these three areas have given rise to speculations ranging the whole field of biology. A recurrent echo is \"cloning?\" . Americans are developing an unfortunate folklore about cloning, due to the influence of movies and television; unfortunate because it contains some major misconceptions. \"On the streetcorner\" these misconceptions are just meaningless talk, but if we want to hypothesize about clones in Ufology, then the errors can be embarassing. The job of this report is to do our \"homework\" on the biology of cloning. Let's find out what it is. Then, perhaps speculation can take place on more solid ground. \"Cloning\" is a word which covers a variety of methods of speculation. It simply means reproduction-without- sex. That already sounds like not much fun, right? Well, if you were looking for sex, you haven't come to the right place. Plants and microorganisms clone themselves quite a lot. Simple splitting and \"budding\" phenomena reproduce the original individual in genetic precision. Genetics is the key. If the \"new\" individual has all the genes of the \"old\" or \"original\" one, and no other genes, then the new individual is the original's genetic twin, or clone. We humans clone plants all the time, when we snip off a portion of an \"original\" individual and let it grow into a new whole genetic twin. So far so good, genetic twinning and cloning seem a common natural process. How about \"advanced\" animals? What about cloning in mammals, humans, ufonauts? In mammals and humans we get genetic twinning frequently. It happens like this: tube babies are well-known and new clinics are sprouting up all over the country. The test-tube baby technology fertilizes eggs with sperm in a lab culture dish and waits for the single- cells to begin to divide. If they do, they show that they're viable and on the way to becoming somebody genetically special. Then, the \"baby-maker\" doctor takes the small embryo (usually only 8 or 16 cells) and implants it in the uterus (womb) of the mother-to-be. Although the details of the craftiness of the cel\\. Mom's egg and Dad's sperm coalesce to form a one-cell embryo, which if all goes normally will become a baby with half of each of their genes. The embryo begins its cell multiplication process by duplicating its genes and \"growing\" new genetically- identical cells. Usually this just goes forward smoothly until we have a healthy baby. But, if the early cells fall apart, becoming two separate genetically identical cells instead of one, then they may both go on to become babies. These babies are of the same genes. They are clones of each other. They are not clones of Mom or Dad, as they are only half identical to their parents, but they are clones and they happen all the time. As of now, this type of cloning in humans (or ufonauts) would be the simplest to do \"on purpose\", even with current Earth technolgy. How? Test- scientist are more complex than this, the main steps in the process are simple. So, how do we use this for \"cloning'? All we do to produce as many \"genetic twins\" as we want, is to get the test-tube baby technology going and separate the first pair of duplicated cells whenever it appears. In other words, make them pop apart. You can keep popping them until you get the number of individual cell-genetic twins that you need, and then let them go on naturally to produce your cadre of clones. Of course, you will need \"volunteer mothers\" or surrogates to host the pregnancy, unless you have invented an artificial womb. Well, what if we don't want to just make twins in vast numbers, but want to clone an \"original,\" someone already adult? That, for mammals, is harder, (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Swords, Continued but not impossible. And, there are several methods. One way is Parthenogenesis, so- called \"virgin birth.\" Since all the cells of an individual are genetically' identical (each of your cells, for instance, has a . complete and perfect set of just your genes), it should be possible .to convince any cell to pretend like it's an embryo and start multiplying -to become a whole person. If we could convince a cell in a woman's uterus to begin to do this, for instance, it could develop right in place in the womb. It would come,to term as a clone of the woman, each of its (her) cells genetic twins of the mother's. This exact result has already been produced in the biology lab with mammals such as rabbits and mice. The.alert reader will note that this cannot explain the most famous \"virgin birth\" in history, however. Parthenogenesis produces clones, and the sex must be identical to the clonee. Mary would have had to have a girl. Parthenogenesis could be used to clone originals of either sex, if we could unlock the genetic blocks to embryo development present in the cells of the adult. Obviously our cells don't all want to become baby clones of us (thank goodness) and are busily specializing as heart, brain, and skin cells et al. But, the whole potential is still there. If we can unlock the expression of the entire genetic mass, then any cell in the test- tube may begin to develop, and be implantable in host wombs. Our current science can get these cells started, but they turn into tumors instead of embryos. READY FOR THE NEXT FLAP? \"In 1973, when the flap hit, we were inadequate. We didn't have people in some area, and the ones we did, they had so many cases they couldn't follow them. That's why we keep saying, prepare for the next one...\" Walt Andrus, during an informal MUFON session at the University of Nebraska, 6 Nov. 12, 1983. A second method of cloning adults is \"nuclear transplantation.\" This word is made for confusion. It has nothing to do with nuclear energy or radiation. The term \"nuclear\" refers to the nucleus of the cell. For our purposes, there is nothing complicated about this. The process is just taking the area of the cell where the genes are (the nucleus) and sticking it into an egg: \"nuclear transplantation.\" We first take out the egg's own nucleus because we don't want the genes in there gumming up the cloning project, but we keep the rest of the egg intact, because eggs and egg chemistry are vital for the early development of the embryo. So: with a fine needle, we just fuse. the whole cell into the gentically-empty egg. This is done with an inactivated (non : infectious) virus, since viruses have the ability to sneak inside our cells' defensive walls. Everything else is basically the same. We might use a laser to blast out the genes in the egg, if we want to be more hi-tech about it. This method is currently being researched by Dr. Audrey Muggleton-Harris at Worcester Polytechnic Institute Worcester, Mass., on a federal grant. Perhaps Dr. Harris has already cloned the first mammal by this method. Well, that's cloning as we see it. Note that what you get is a genetic If we can microsurgically.remove the egg nucleus and toss it out without hurting the rest of the egg, and if we can microsurgically remove the donee's cell nucleus without hurting it, and insert (transplant) it to the egg, we stand a good chance of the egg thinking that it's \"fertile\" and going on (with the help of a host mother) to become a clone. This experiment has been done many times with animals like frogs (because their eggs are big, see- through, and external, they're easier to work with). It is also claimed by our local \"Brave New World Reproduction Master,\" Dr. Landrum Shettles, of Randolph, Vermont that he has done the_same for humans up to the stage of implanting the embryo. If Dr. Shettles speaks truth, then human cloning of adults is already on the pad and ready for launching. The last method for human cloning of adults is called \"cell fusion.\" It is really only a fancy variety of nuclear transplantation. In the fusion method, instead of plucking the cell nucleus out duplicate, not necessarily (and not likely) a \"perfect\" duplicate. If the .environment treats the duplicate differently than the original, then you will see differences in appearance and/or behavior. To put it in the extreme to make the point, if you don't feed the clone it < will be quite a bit thinner and a lot deader than the original was as the same age. Even if you created a cadre of clones of the same age, small differences in nutrition, environmental health, exercise, societal interaction, arid education would likely produce easily recognizable idiosyncrasies, just as we see in identical twins today. How do we apply this knowledge to the \"Ufonaut\" phenomenon? Here are a few points: 1. Cloning a space crew would not be at all difficult for a high tech civilization, although why they'd want to do it is not obvious. 2. If would be likely that a cloned (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"GUNSHOT WOUND FROM AN ALIEN? By Stan Gordon Pennsylvania State Director In the early morning hours of May 21, 1971, near West Leisenring, Pennsylvania, not far from the city of Uniontown, Larry Ryan*, 42, had just left some friends in the city and was returning to his home. It was about 1:10 AM when Ryan rounded the bend on the rural road about two miles from his home. He had just turned his car radio off and had his window down. As soon as he made the bend, he saw an unusual object hovering about 20 to 25 feet above the ground. The object was saucer shaped with a five-foot high dome at the top, and protruding from the dome was an appendage resembling an antenna, except that it was about a foot thick, sharpening at the tip. The object appeared to be about 120 feet long and 40 feet high, with a slightly oversized door-opening a little left of center. This opening did not have a door, and from it appeared an orange-red glow of interior light: There were no other lights from the object, no other openings and no steps reaching the ground. The object was making a sound not dissimilar to a power substation, when it can be heard Larry Ryan saw 40 by 120 foot object behind barn to hum. The sound was steady and of moderate intensity, but very noticeable. Ryan eased his Ford Mustang to within 75 yards of the object, shifted into low gear and continued to view the object with clutch depressed. After observing the object for over two minutes, Ryan saw a figure outlined against the internal illumination of the craft, walk from the right to the left side of the opening and shortly afterward another figure (possibly the same one) walked from left to right. Neither of these figures glanced at the witness. Both figures were dressed in a gray- white metallic looking outfit, with a hood or cowl, as on a hooded warm-up jersey, and were approximately 6 feet tall and walked normally. At no time could Ryan see any equpment inside the object. In fact, except for the figures, it looked completely empty. The craft was fully visable and appeared to be a dull gray color, but what appeared to be burnt areas were observed along the bottom of the object. The object was hovering behind a barn and would have been hidden from view by anyone approaching the area from the opposite direction. Just as the second figure disappeared from view, Ryan for some unknown reason turned his head about 45 degrees to the left and over his shoulder, and saw another (continued on next page) Swords, Continued cadre of ufonauts would not be perfectly identical in appearance or behavior any more than \"identical twins\" on Earth are. 3. We shouldn't assume that animals of another species or ufonauts are clones just because we think that they look alike at first impression. Individuals of different species tend to \"look identical\" to us until we make a very close study of them. Cloning may be a dead-end road in ufological speculation. 4. Cloning does not in any way explain the seemingly bizarre physical characteristics (for example, hands without thumbs, torsos without gastrointestimal tracts) alleged by some reports. Cloning can account for having a whole bunch of something once you have the \"master print,\" but it cannot explain a bizarre \"original.\" Some have (loosely) thrown around ideas of bio- engineered cyborgs for alien planet excursion purposes. Someone else (other than this author) will have to attempt to defend that hypothesis. 5. Cloning could not explain (by itself) the science fiction movie scenario of mad scientists or aliens duplicating an adult human and replacing him or her with the clone. Cloning creates a twin, but it is a twin separated by years in age from the adult original. For example, cloning Ronald Reagan would not produce a baby looking like the President at age 70. It would produce a baby looking (generally) like Ron looked as a baby. In 70 years, it would look like Reagan looks now. When someone tells you \"you're replaceable\" they don't mean by cloning.. So, there's our trip through the Brave New World of Cloning. People interested in finding the truth behind Ufology and other Forteana need to understand the esoteric concepts that are often tossed about so casually. This is especially true if anyone really wants to be taken seriously. Ufology is so controversial that little slips and ignorances here and there are all it takes to lose the day — even if you are otherwise correct in everything that is genuinely significant. Watch the skies, of course; but do your homework, too."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Gunshot, Continued figure standing about three feet from the car. This figure was discernable only from the upper chest to the belt line and was dressed in the same colored metallic appearing outfit (resembling aluminum foil). No extremities could be seen. However, a click was heard, similar to a firing pin falling on an empty chamber of a gun- After a brief moment (one to two seconds), a blast shoved the witness onto the console between the front seats and a report, much like a shotgun, was heard. The car moved forward as Ryan removed his foot from the clutch and depressed the accelerator and sped up the road passing the object on the right. He immediately peered over the dash to guide his vehicle and when well past the object felt his back and found a hole in his shirt and his hand was smeared with blood. He drove to a local emergency station not knowing how seriously he was wounded. About 4% to 5 minutes had elasped since he first saw the object. Two rescue men arrived in about 10 minutes, and took Ryan to the emergency room at Uniontown Hospital. On the way to the hospital they passed the farm where the object had been hovering, but it was no longer present. At the hospital, X-rays were taken, his wounds were cleaned and dressed by a doctor, and his story was related to the doctor and a state trooper. Ryan was detained in the emergency room over night. The state police took his T-shirt and blue poplin shirt and returned them the next morning. Early the next morning a surgeon examined the wound and redressed it, then discharged Ryan while making an appointment to see him in five days. Ten days after that visit the witness was told that a pellet could not be removed due to penetration depth and danger of possible injury to tendons. Ryan's shirt has two holes, one above the wound and one in the upper left sleeve, but only one pellet is in his body (upper left shoulder). His car has nearly 100 pellet size dents which appeared much like ,a shotgun pattern from 25 feet, but Ryan claims he was shot from only a few feet away. Some holes are in the dash of the car. Our UFO research team obtained a metallic pellet from the windshield area of the car. Laboratory analysis indicated it was composed of materials common to shotgun pellets. It should be noted that at the time of the sighting, the temperature was in the high 50's (warm for the season), with the moon and stars out. It was a fairly bright night. The combination of lack of sleep over the incident, the fact that very few people believed his story led Ryan to begin to drink heavily, which he hadn't done previously. On JuneS, 1971, Ryan admitted himself to Western Psychiatric Hospital in Pittsburgh. Drawing made by witness of object seen May 21,1971 Door peppered by pellets While there he suffered two heart attacks. After leaving the hospital at the end of July, he was confined to bed for one month at home. Ryan could find no agency at the time to report this unusual sighting to, although he tried several sources, including the military. He was finally referred to us by a news agency source. The witness appeared to be intelligent, and had above normal command of the English language (he was a Cryptographic Analyst for the Army while serving overseas). The story was related matter of factly and without embellishments on the already bizarre case. He just wants to find out what the incident was all about. It was strange enough to have a close observation of an Unidentified Flying Object and it's occupants, but could it be possible that they actually used a conventional weapon to cast even further doubt on the testimony of Mr. Ryan? There is no doubt that the man was shot. Only the method, motive and assailant is unknown. *Larry Ryan is a psuedonym. His real name and address are on file with the Pennsylvania Association For the Study of the Unexplained (PASU)."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"JOURNAL'S ADIEU TO THE BAILEY PHOTOS By Ann Druffcl The \"Critique\" on the Bailey case in the September 1983 issue held no surprises for me. From the beginning of the investigation I realized that Bailey's \"full light\" photos had to be taken with the aid of a brilliant light source. I saw that the shadows moved from right to left, as they would with a flashbar, and questioned Bailey about this. Rev. Bailey stated that, to the best of his memory, there was no flashbar available to him that evening. He has stated repeatedly that he woke up the next morning with fragments of memory about the episode and that other bits filtered through during the past several weeks, giving him an acceptable (to him): chronology of events. His memories of that night are still incomplete. He has refused offers of hypnotic regression by psychotherapists to recover full memory. He was terrified during the episode and states he does not wish to relive the terror. He resides alone and his fear is perhaps logical, but not helpful. Several other researchers have asked him the same questions about the full-light photos. He gives everyone the same answer; there has been no attempt to embellish or to cover up \"mistakes.\" He realizes the illogic but sticks to his story. He states that his floor lamp flickered off and on that evening. I have seen it do this, but that would not explain the placement of the shadows from right to left. In this, Joe Thomas's input has been helpful. If Bailey had wanted to hoax entity photos, why did he throw in the hokey, amateurish-looking full light phtos with the other dimmer, shadowed ones which are more impressive (but which, in the heat of controversy, have been almost ignored)? . A few days after the photos were taken, early in the morning of November 1, 1978, Rev. Bailey put an ad in the Pasadena Star-News asking anyone who might have played a trick on him to come forward. He realized that some of the photos looked hoaxed. He asked his fellow ministers to pray for him while he tried to figure out how the pictures were taken. If Joe Thomas felt anguish, think of what witness Bailey went through! Parts of Bailey's narrative describe bizarre happenings, and some of the pictures are bizarre. His words suit the action; his statements fit the photos exactly. The only people whom the pictures have not caused anguish are those investigators, including myself, who have tried objectively to make sense of them — either as genuine or hoaxed — in the light of Rev. Bailey's statements concerning them. Those who are most interested in them are those who can accept the bizarre. Since many aspects of the photos (if genuine) are apparently paraphysical, I tried at first to interpret them from a paraphysical point of view. I realized later that they are not totally paranormal, but are a mixture of physical and parapsychical. I cannot be faulted for trying to interpret them — that is what the scientific method is all about. I learned very soon that a Polaroid One-Step can produce cleancut double images in insufficient light, but this knowledge came too late to be included in my article about them. But why are the other images in these \"double image\" photos, (such as the disembodied heads and the clusters of lights) not double-imaged? There is still a puzzle here. Several psychic researchers, such as Alan Vaughan,* who have given input into this case find the photos intriguing and, viewing them with the necessary cool detachment, feel that they are probably genuine. In parapsychology, the bizarre is often \"normal.\" Many physical scientists like Joe have no understanding or acceptance of parapsychology. The very mention of \"psychic aspects of UFOs\" causes them anguish. Many physical scientists try to squeeze the UFO phenomenon into a tight niche in earth's space-time. It will not be so confined. There are psychic aspects to the UFOs, as anyone is aware who has been in this field long enough to investigate many types of cases. Joe Thomas has encountered several such cases, but he assigns them all to a growing trash heap, labeling all such witnesses liars and hoaxers. Is this any way to seek the truth? He invents a term, \"symbiotic relationship\" and applies it to my acceptance of Bailey as a puzzled human being. His need to invent such terms springs from his own inability to understand how another investigator can patiently study complex and puzzling cases using time-proven interviewing techniques. I do not \"believe\" the Bailey photos are genuine — neither do I dismiss them as a hoax. I have not come to any definite conclusion, for I. do not know enough about them yet. A lot more study is necessary before they can be satisfactorily judged. They are, however, probably not ufological in nature, as we commonly understand the term. The humanoid forms (you're kidding about the starfish, aren't you, Joe?) are clearly some type of physical form silhouetted against a strong light source. If the photos are genuine, these forms would seem to be temporarily physical manifestations which are not of our normal space-time. I would suggest, from my present knowledge of the case, that the forms (if genuine) might have been posing as UFO beings. The Bailey photos do not belong in UFO research; they belong in the field (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"WILLIAM D.

In the January-February 1979 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal (No. 133), Bill wrote about his \"Foo-Fighter\" experience while flying a B-17 Flying Fprtress over Germany on November 24, 1944. Bill had several articles published in the Journal. After moving to Texarkana, Arkansas, in 1978, he was appointed the State Section Director for the surrounding counties. When Bill Pitts retired as State Director for Arkansas William D. Leet in 1980, Mr. Leet was selected for this important post. During the past year, Bill made great strides in building up his investigative team in the state, jokingly called the \"Arkie Army.\" On August 24th, Mildred and Ed Higgins hosted the most recent Arkansas Mini- Symposium at their mountain top home \"Starsong,\" with Bill Leet presiding. Our hearts and sympathy are extended to Helen Leet, Bill's widow. She has been such a gracious behind- the-scenes partner in Ufology with her husband. Mrs. Norma E. Lindblad, .the Public Relations Director for Arkansas, will be the temporary State Director until a replacement for Mr. Leet is found. Norma's address is Route 5, Box 364, Texarkana, Texas 75501. Druffel, Continued of psychic research. Perhaps this field will help provide photo enhancement methods — deblurring and \"dodging\" techniques, for example, which the UFO field could not provide. Perhaps, too, we can obtain photomicrographic enlargements of the appendages so that meaningful comparisons of their texture can be made. Joe's \"Fruit of the Loom\" comparison photos are helpful and I thank him for his efforts. The JOURNAL'S inadequate reproductive processes, however, obscure the facts. I invite anyone who is interested in seeing the truth to look at slides of Bailey's appendages and Joe's comparison legs in my 24x-48x microviewer, and learn first hand that Bailey's appendages cannot be so easily copied. Bailey's photos show bumps, 10 clumps, folds, and fibrous texture such as are seen on some genuine photos of ectoplasmic manifestations taken in the 1920s — photos which are generally regarded as genuine by the most hard- headed psychic researchers. Joe's photos show only folds, and they look exactly like what they are — a folded tee shirt. The answers are not yet in. Much study still has to be done, and it will be done. But for the benefit of all JOURNAL readers who are tired of the Bailey, controversy, rest easy, for you will hear no more. *A short, inaccurate and sardonic article on the Bailey photos appeared in the May '83 OMNI under Alan Vaughan's by-line. He did not author this. He wrote an accurate 750-word article with Bailey's and my cooperation, for we thought OMNI wanted to print the facts. Without Vaughan's knowledge, his article was replaced by one invented by an OMNI/staff writer — another sterling example of that magazine's biased views. Abduction study group is formed Budd Hopkins, author of Missing Time, has announced that a UFO Abduction Study Group is being founded in New York City. 'This is an informal thing opera ting within the various large.UFO groups,\" Hopkins said during a talk at the University of Nebraska's second annual conference on Exploring Unexplained Phenomena. \"There are four reasons for establishing this group,\" he said. \"One is' to compile a list of the various physical and psychological consequences reported and investigated in UFO experiences in a search for meaningful patterns. \"To facilitate this compilation, abduction events and effects are going to be organized into three basic groups or time frames. \"This includes any unusual behavior, subjective feelings or events noticed by the witnesses in the hours immediately before the UFO or occupants are encountered. In other words, everything that happens first, like, for instance, that sense of dread or lights flashing on and off on the car, or the sense that one makes the right turn down a road one's never gone down before, that sort of thing. \"The second, of course is the encounter itself, what happens when the figures approach and so on, the basic abduction, scenario, everything the person remembers up until he or she returns to their normal environment. \"Then the third time frame is the aftermath. This period includes any long-term or short-term emotional, psychological or physical aftereffects described by the witness or any later experiences which seem to the witness to be related to the UFO experience.\" All this material, Hopkins said, \"is going into a data bank eventually, we hope. We are searching for patterns. \"I hope that other groups will form the same way around the world, but the ultimate thing is that we want to help the people who had these experiences.\""},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"STRANGE BEHAVIOR OF 'CLOUD' OVER CALIFORNIA NAVAL ANNEX A retired Marine Corps officer and his wife reported seeing what at first appeared to be a cloud undergo an unusual transformation while they were driving through a military base in California. The incident occurred about 10:30 AM on Nov. 22, 1983, as Robert Q. Bekins Jr. and his wife were crossing the Fallbrook Annex of the Naval Weapons Station at Seal Beach, California. \"My wife saw a small cumulus-type cloud to the north of us,\" Bekins, a former fighter pilot and a retired major, said in a report to MUFON. \"It was all by itself and appeared to be stationary. There's a UFO,' she said, and laughed. \"I .laughed and said, 'Yeah, it probably is — say, that sure is a strange cloud, hanging there all by itself.' \" They looked around the sky and saw nothing else that looked anything like it. They were driving at 45 miles an hour, the speed limit, and could not stop because military regulations prohibit stopping or picture taking on the annex. \"We watched for a few more seconds and then some black 'stuff started dropping from it,\" said Bekins. \"It looked stringy and parts looked lumpy, like globs of oil on water. The different shade of the light cloud and the dark stuff was very obvious against the gray clouds on the far horizon.\" The material seemed to fall toward the right at an angle of 10 to 15 degrees from the vertical, he said. . . \"As we continued our easterly route, the cloud seemed to start rising, : all the while still dropping the black stuff, and rapidly assumed the shape of an open umbrella,\" Bekins continued. \"The color of the cloud top changed from very light gray to white in this rapid ascent. As the cloud turned to white, it also smoothed out on top and became more balloon looking rather than puffed, as a cumulus cloud. \"The edges of the umbrella began to disintegrate, the black stuff stopped O falling and finally the whole thing turned into a bunch of small, puffy clouds as we lost it behind a hill. \"The last view showed the 'object' about four times as high as when we first saw it.\" When it disintegrated, he said, it rapidly broke up into 10 to 15 small clouds, adding that the initial size of the \"cloud\" was about as big as his fingernail (1.3 cm) held at arm's length. The entire sighting lasted about two minutes. 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"UFOS AND HOT RINGS By James McCampbell Copyright 1983 McCampbell The growing popularity of microwave ovens has acquainted most people with the basic rules for their use. Foods are cooked only in paper, glass, or ceramic containers because these materials do not conduct electricity. Metal objects, however, are never placed in the ovens because of their ability to carry electrical current. The electric field in microwave ovens causes conduction electrons inside the metal to accelerate. As the field reverses with each cycle of the wave, electrons are accelerated first in one direction then another, producing an electric current of very high frequency corresponding to the frequency of the source. Collisions between the moving electrons and atoms in the crystal lattice transfer energy to the metal itself. This accumulation of energy in the metal is evidenced by an increase in temperature. Therefore, metal objects are forbidden in microwave ovens because they might get too hot or even melt. Such microwave heating may have been present in the Cash-Landrum case that occurred near Huffman, Texas, on December 29, 1980. l Three witnesses were driving at night; it was chilly (40°F) and the car heater was on. Betty Cash, the driver, stopped the car and walked to the left front fender to gaze upward at an unknown aerial vehicle that was glowing brilliantly at a range of less than 65 meters. She felt intense heat on her skin. When finally coaxed back into the car after 5 to 10 minutes, she found the door handle was so hot that she had to use her leather coat as a hotpad to grasp it. The car interior had become so hot that the heater was turned off and the air conditioner was turned on. These effects could have been caused by infrared radiation, but there are other important implications that are discussed later. On March 31, 1980, two young 12 men encountered a circular UFO in Bari, Italy. 2 The next day, Felipe Garcia, 19, had a burn on his wrist directly beneath his watch that had stopped. In addition, Paride Orbei, 17, had a burn under his \"cowboy belt.\" The fact that this short report was translated from Spanish and the experience of his friend raise the unanswered question of whether the burn was not actually under his belt buckle. More common are reports concerning rings being worn on the fingers by the witnesses, as in the Mona Stafford case. 3 Three women in an automobile were chased by a huge disc- shaped craft at close range. The driver lost control of the car as the interior became very hot. The car was allegedly levitated inside the UFO and kept there for about an hour and a half. When back on the ground, Mona \". . .took off her ring and found that the skin under it was very red.\" The hot-ring syndrome is an important element in another revealing event that has received little publicity, at least in the United States. On December 13, 1967, David Winter experienced a typical automotive failure while driving home in British Columbia at 2:15 AM. 4 The lights dimmed and the engine sputtered, then failed. Winter pulled off the road, stopped, got out, and opened the hood to search for clues to his problem. Then he noticed an object about 100 yards away hovering about 50 feet above the ground. It looked like a dome, flat on the bottom, displaying red and green lights with what appeared to be portholes emitting white light. The surface looked like steel that had been wire-brushed. It was a clear, cold night (about 10 to 25°F) with a shining moon. He noted that the battery felt warm like \". . .hot water about 95°F.\" Being appre- hensive, he then got back into the car while observing the object moving toward him in a gentle rocking motion. He became frightened when he discovered that his hair felt warm to the touch. Later, he sajd, \"the copper ring on the left ring finger got rather warm and unpleasant to feel and I finally took it off. I have a sterling ring on my right little finger. And it wasn't as hot as the copper ring but it was still getting unpleasant, so I decided to take.that off too. And I noticed my watch getting a little — I have a metal watch band here — and it got warm.\" Also, he said, \"a metal button and metal.fly in my pants got hot.\" During a second -inspection of the car, he retrieved a flashlight from a tool box and noticed that its metal frame became hot but the lens remained cool. Metallic parts of the car had become hot but the tires felt as cold as the air. About 5 minutes after he returned to the driver's seat, the object rotated about 100 degrees and then shot vertically out of sight in 2 to 3 seconds. His lights then came back on and he was able to start the engine and drive away. A problem with a ring also occurred in the Cash-Landrum case that was all but obscured by the traumatic injuries suffered by the witnesses. The skin on Betty Cash's finger underneath her ring was burned. 5 A technical diversion is required here to explore the possibility that finger rings might be unusually sensitive to the presence of UFOs and that they manifest that effect by getting hot enough to become uncomfortable or even burn the skin. Mature people will recall that, many years ago, antennas in the shape of circles were used on some ships, boats, and aircraft. They were part of a navigational system used to determine the direction to a radio transmitter. (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"McCampbell, Continued Upon turning the antennas around a vertical axis, one obtained a maximum signal when the plane of the circle was 'edge-on' toward the radiating source. But no signal at all was received when the axis of the circle pointed toward the sending station. This 'null' position, being critically sensitive, was used to locate the station of interest. The diameter of the antenna depended upon the band of frequencies to be detected but it was typically 12 to 14 inches. This principle of radio direction finding is universally used in sophisticated equipment today but the bulky and awkward antennas have become passe'. Now consider the physics of a loop antenna that is edge-on to an incoming electromagnetic wave whose wavelength /J. is twice the diameter (d) of the loop. The accompanying diagram illustrates such an electromagnetic wave traveling from left to right  j _. in the plane K T*~ \"~H of a ring. An electric field (E) will induce a current (i) clockwise in the front half of ring whereas, at the same instant, an equivalent field at the rear half will induce a current that is also clockwise. This reinforcement of current at a particular wavelength is called resonant pumping. At wavelengths not far from the resonant condition and beyond, the reinforcement collapses. . Do finger rings behave like loop antennas, resonating with an incoming signal and heating up due to an induced electrical current? .They can! If they do so ini the presence of a UFO, the resonant wavelength and corresponding frequency can be easily and accurately calculated. A common, size of ladies' ring, No. 6%, was measured with calipers on a standard,. wand-type gauge to have a diameter of 17 mm.* From considerations above, one has the simple relationship that ^. =2d hence the resonating wave- length must be 2(17) =34 mm=3.4 cm corresponding to a frequency of 8,800 megahertz (million cycles per second). This radiation is in the region of short microwaves, not a surprising result as much evidence has been previously adduced by the author that such radiation is emitted by UFOs. As Betty Cash stood in front of the car, she held her arm up in front of her face as a shield against heat and glare. 7 So it is likely that the plane of her ring pointed in the general direction of the UFO. Vickie Landrum, on the other hand stood close to the right side of the car with her left hand on the car top. If her elbow was bent so that her fingers were pointed forward in the general direction of the UFO, her ring would have been close to the null position as regards the above effect. In other words, her ring would not be pumped even at the resonant frequency. Vickie Landrum does, in fact, wear two rings on the fourth finger of her left hand as shown in photographs in References 1 and 5. She did not experience a hot ring. But she was not exposed to the radiation as long as Betty, having climbed back into the car after two to three minutes.- Even the heating that Betty felt on her face can be ascribed to microwave radiation instead of infrared that might be a normal supposition. Microwaves up to 3-cm wavelength were found in some early experiments by the U.S. Navy to be comparable to infrared in producing the sensation of heat on the skin. That energy is readily, absorbed in the skin where subcutaneous sensors register the feeling of heat. 8 Data from those experiments can be used to estimate the intensity of microwave radiation to which Betty Cash may have been exposed. '- Experimental subjects were exposed to microwave radiation that was pulsed at 2,300 times per second with a pulse width of 0.4 microseconds. The beam was applied to 37 cm 2 on their foreheads because that area is relatively flat and highly sensitive to radiant energy. After an exposure of three seconds, the test subjects could just begin to feel heat from far infrared radiation with an intensity of about 0.5 meal sec' 1 cm\" 2 (millicalories per second per square centimeter). For 3-cm .microwaves, the value was 7 times greater on 3.5 meal sec' 1 cm' 2 . In more convenient dimensions, the latter value becomes 14.7 mW/cm 2 . In other words, if the sensation of heat experienced by Betty Cash were caused by microwaves of approxi- mately 3-cm wavelength, the radiant intensity must have been greater than 14.7 mW/cm 2 . Of course, the sensation could have been produced by infrared, in which case the intensity must have been greater than l/7th of that value or 2.1 mW/cm 2 . In either event, the radiant intensity,may be compared to that from all wavelengths in sunlight of approximately 134 mW/cm 2 . Infrared radiation could have burned the skin on Betty's finger but not under the ring. This strongly suggests that radiation from this UFO contained a significant component in the short, microwave region having a wavelength very close . to the ring resonance of 3.4 cm. Such radiation is consistent with all of the effects described above that can not be produced by infrared radiation alone. REFERENCES 1. Schuessler, John F.

Definite animal reactions were noted from a large, domed craft that hovered close to the ground in the pre-dawn hours, showing a bright red light. At 4 AM on September 30,1974, a somewhat' unusual close encounter took place on the Kent Plott dairy ranch about four miles southeast of Orland, California, a small farming community 32 miles south of Red Bluff. The Sacramento River ambles along north to south about three miles farther east in relatively flat farming land.

It was a starry clear night with a last quarter moon still in the sky. Hubert Brown, a 22-year-old dairy milker, was in the outer field fairly close to the gate, attempting to bring in the last string of . cows to be milked. The dairy barn itself, an open shed with a roof, was already about three quarters filled with cows waiting to be milked. There was space at the input end of the retaining shed for the animals coming in with Hubert. The whole structure was about 130 feet long by about 50 feet wide. A cement block building attached at the other end of the shed housed the milking stalls and equipment, with a small side door facing the ranch house for easy entry. As Brown was preparing to open the outer field gate, his eyes caught a bright red glowing object descending rapidly toward him at approximately a 35-degree angle out of the northeast. The cattle around him began to bolt and scatter to the far ends of the field in every direction. The UFO came down almost to the ground not too far from Brown. He took off like a rocket, clearing the five- foot gate in one big leap, running as fast as he could for the side door of the milking shed. Screaming for his co-worker as he ran, Brown bolted through the open doorway, slipped on the wet concrete floor and went sprawling onto the surface. Scrambling to his feet again, he grabbed at his superior, 37-year-old Tyroh Philips, who had been busy milking. Pointing frantically and wide-eyed at the unknown intruder out the far end of the open barn, he gasped but was unable to utter any intelligent words.

Dust was flying everywhere. . About 120 cows already in the barn, waiting to be milked, were now packed tightly together pushing each other up against the inside divider barrier. Every cow's head was intently riveted in the direction of the UFO, ears pointed upward and seemingly frozen as if paralyzed. The UFO, estimated to be 60 to 70 feet in diameter, hovered and wobbled a few feet off the ground about 200 yards away from Brown and Philips. It was emitting a moderate, humming sound. A bright red light on top was illuminating the whole craft and a considerable area of ground around it. It was a typical domed-disc craft and was sharply outlined to the two human witnesses. It appeared to have windows, but this was difficult to perceive due to the bright red glow. After about 30 to 40 seconds, the object suddenly took off at about a 45-degree angle into the sky and disappeared to the west. It was almost nine months before we received word of the encounter. \"It scared the hell out of me,\" Brown admitted. When I asked Philips about Brown's frantic reaction, he said, \"I thought he had gone bananas!\" Philips said the cows were packed so close together, backed up in the barn, that he couldn't get his hand between any of them and they stayed that way for some time; This is an exceptional example of close observation of animal reaction to a UFO. Kent Plott, the ranch owner, who is a private pilot, was asleep in the ranch house nearby, as was the rest of the family, so they were totally unaware of the event at that time of the morning.

I did ask Plott if he noticed any burned or discolored grass in the field, but he said there was none. He did comment that the next day the milk yield was considerably less than average from these Holstein cattle. The animals still showed signs of being somewhat nervous for the next day or two.

The sighting occurred between 4 and 4:30 PM on October 16, 1982, in Boyd County, Kentucky, in the far northeastern part of the state. The witness, a 40-year-old electronics specialist, insisted oil not being identified. He was working on a communica- tions tower when a reflection from the sky made him look up. He saw a dark object the size of a house moving from east to west across the sky, with two military jets pacing it. At first, he thought it was a balloon, but upon watching it for several seconds he was surprised and amazed to see that it was cube shaped. A former serviceman familiar with military planes, he realized the object was not like any military or commercial aircraft he had ever seen. At the same time, he was certain the two jets were military planes. Whether they were chasing it or accompanying it, he couldn't tell. At regular intervals, the object appeared to make what the witness called a \"tumble-forward\" motion. When it did, the tumbling was a smooth, slow-motion movement. Throughout the sighting, which the witness estimated lasted about six minutes, the object and jets flew together at a constant speed. He wondered if the object wasn't a military or governmental test craft. Neither the object nor the jets altered course at any time during his observation and they disappeared from view together. A check with airports and military bases in the area uncovered nothing that would give a clue to the cube- shaped object. One source said military jets had conducted an exercise across much of the state that day, but he knew nothing of any craft resembling the object. On Dec. 21, 1982, I received a phone call from a public affairs specialist at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, in response to my query. He said Wright- Patterson did have a refueling craft similar in description to the cube- shaped, object but that it was still in controlled testing and had never been \"above ground.\" I asked if he would put this information in a letter to me and he said he would. However, when the letter arrived a week later, he simply said he could find no record of any military flights over Boyd County that day. There was no mention of the refueling test craft. LETTERS Morrison Responds Editor, The comments on my essay, \"The German Hypothesis,\" were a bit disappointing. Perhaps I should have sent in a really scathing letter over the signature of a friend. A lot of objections could be raised to the possibility of the German invention of UFO craft. Cost is not one, however. Obviously UFOs have few mechanical parts and perhaps none at all. An analogy has been drawn by Bruce Maccabee by comparing our spacecraft with old computers (or telephone switching circuits that use relays) and UFOs with solid state integrated circuits. What we lack is not technique, I suspect, but some basic science. UFOs are probably easy to make and cheap, once you know how. Mr. Banks (No. 16 185, July 1983) and others might enjoy reading Jay Forrester's writings on technical innovation. Certainly the craft described in UFO's, Nazi Secret Weapon? are no more genuine than the Navy's \"flying flapjack.\" Both obviously were decoys created by different sources for similar ends. The prevalence of disc-shaped craft adds some more interesting circumstantial evidence. Designing the hypothetical gravity control systems would involve some complicated equations. Those without computers would have to resort to a rotationally symmetric design to be able to solve these equations. In recent years a wider variety of UFO shapes has been reported. As far as geopolitics goes, I always have wondered how Hitler and his cohorts could have been so ignorant of the industrial might of the U.S.A. and also of its domestic politics. Two recent books reveal that the Nazi Party was in contact with and supported by some segments of American industry. Trading with the Enemy is available at your local book store. Who Financed Hitler (by James and Suzanne Pool, Dial Press, 1978) is harder to find, but it has a dandy picture of Henry Ford receiving the Grand Cross of the German Eagle from Hitler's representatives. So there can be no doubt that when Germany attacked Poland in 1939, Hitler was quite aware of the ultimate and inevitable outcome. When I completed my article I had not read Jacques Vallee's Messengers of Deception, a circumstance I consider fortunate, since I drew some similar conclusions from much less (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Letters, Continued experience and quite different evidence. Vallee suggests that some unknown private group gained control of the discs, while the Soviets and the Allies were left with the more conventional weapons systems to expropriate (see Chapter 8). Now I am willing to state that my maximum likelihood scenario is that UFOs. are of terrestrial origin and in some sense are a threat to national security. The concept probably originated in Germany in the 1930's, but the identity of the present operating authority is not at all certain. This eliminates the need for the capability to traverse interstellar space by means of some hypothetical extension of general relativity, yet does not preclude it as a possibility. I would like to thank Kris Bjork (No. 185, July 1983) and Lucius Parish (private correspondence), among others, for their words of encouragement. I just wish my Mycroft Holmes approach could open up this Pandora's, box completely. But the scientific establishment has recognized, perhaps correctly, that the UFO phenomenon is a threat to its position in society and will avoid confronting it at all costs. And just as the government cannot do anything about UFOs, ufologists cannot do anything about the government or the scientific community. My predictions for future developments largely echo Vallee's. UFOs never will be investigated scientifically. They will remain always just out of reach, but keep gradually escalating their activity and eroding public confidence in rationalism, secular humanism and the scientific establishment. There will be no UFO invasion; imperialism is a failed institution also. Eventually, like the Hawaiians, we will burn our gods that no longer work. The world of the future will be somewhat pagan, somewhat medieval, with high tech as magic that works, rather than applied science. Japan and the Soviet Union, as well as most of the world, have evolved more in that direction, leaving the Anglo- Saxon world clinging to the Weltanschauung of Rousseau, Jefferson and Bacon. Foster Morrison Rockville, Md. The Peril In Ignoring Skeptics Editor, I agree with the premise of Jim McCampbell's letter (No. 186, August 1983) that \"lights-in-the-sky\" fail to adequately represent the core UFO mystery and that skeptics often focus on them while ignoring more substantial cases, and I heartily endorse his call for papers from MUFON personnel to improve the quality of the Journal. At the same time, I could not disagree more with the conclusions he draws for Journal content and his characterization of Michael Persinger's work and Bob Wanderer's review of it as \"low-grade, worthless, and misleading material....\" Bob Wanderer, in fact, pointed out the narrow application of Persinger's theories to UFOs. Whether we like it or not, simplistic theories (ice \"cometoids,\" plasma, electrified bugs, earthquake lights...) are seized upon by skeptics and gain currency among ill-informed news media people, regardless of their authors' intentions. We ignore the influence of what we consider \"half-baked\" ideas at our own peril. If we have pretensions of being an objective, scientifically oriented organization, it is an essential role for the Journal to air such concepts pro and con. Let Jim McCampbell or others with appropriate scientific qualifications express their criticisms in the pages of the Journal. In fact, it is their duty to do so, just as it is the duty of sincere skeptics to question our reasoning. Real science does not advance by excommunicating \"aberrant\" views, no matter which side you are on. Mr. McCampbell accuses Bob Wanderer and Michael Persinger (and by implication, others who see things differently) of (a) ignorance, (b) \"purposefully rejecting] the data that does not fit their mental bent,\" or (c) intentional dishonesty. He seems guilty of accusation (b) himself. Instead, I believe that some of our philosophical opponents and antagonists are honestly and sincerely wrong. Yes, strong UFO cases as defined by us always should be printed as a top priority. However, the Journal overall should be a medium for dispassionate and objective appraisal of all evidence and theories. To do otherwise would brand us as a \"Journal of UFO Believers.\" We need to seriously examine the question of why UFOs are not recognized as an important scientific problem. Part of the reason may be our own failings in properly presenting the evidence and in answering the skeptical arguments. Instead of burying our heads in the sand, we should be in the forefront of presenting carefully screened information and in confronting skeptical arguments head- on. To pretend that our \"opponents\" are unworthy is to beg the question. If we are unable to answer their arguments, we deserve to lose the debate. Richard Hall Brentwood, Md. Under Attack From Own Data Editor, At first I got a feeling of \"Spanish Inquisition\" from James McCampbell's letter (No. 186, August 1983) blasting me for describing Michael Persinger's earth stress theory in an article in the June issue. One might think Jim would call off the battle against me after his success in his campaign to get MUFON to discontinue my column Critic's Corner (as well as other non- conventional writers such as Druffel and Oberg) from the Journal. So why the big to-do about an article on Persinger; are Journal readers presumed to be so threatened by heresy that they must be shielded from anything that doesn't fit the extra- terrestrial hypothesis? Then I realized the problem Jim may face. On the one hand, he has done outstanding work over the years collecting and comparing data on cases where an automobile engine fails when a UFO comes near, and sometimes where the engine restarts by itself when (continued on next page) 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Letters, Continued the UFO leaves; in his fine paper at the Pasadena conference, he demonstrates the role of the ionization of the atmosphere in such cases. On the other hand, Jim is a firm and unflinching believer and advocate of the ETH. The difficulty here is that this specific data, and Jim's excellent work with it, make these phenomena more understandable, and therefore increase the possibility (I would say probability) of some sort of electromagnetic or other natural/terrestrial explanation here, such as Persinger's suggestion of an electrical force connected with earth stress, or other such unusual natural effect. Jim's fervent belief in the ETH is thus under attack, you might say, from his own data. No wonder he's upset. Despite Jim's extremely dim views of my writing and of Persinger's, I remain impressed by the quality of Jim's work, and its helpfulness in developing a more useful theory than the ETH. Robert Wanderer San Francisco The Readers Believe Editor, 1. I don't care for articles trying to convince skeptics about UFOs. Your readers believe or they wouldn't have subscribed. 2. I like articles on abductions and sightings. For some reason, they have all disappeared off the newsstand in the last few years. 3. Also some photographs and drawings are of interest. 4. Also, I don't care for articles to discredit skeptics' viewpoints. We will always have non-believers. A.A. Taylor Windsor, Ontario Where Is The Imagination? Editor, I have noticed that skeptics such as Robert Wanderer and debunkers such as Phil Klass more than less take the approach of psychological attack. Perhaps we have not dealt with the psychological aspects of UFOlogical experience adequately. It is probably not possible to eliminate perceptual and behaviorial factors from any particular case. 18 Once adequately dealt with, I am sure that it could be demonstrated that UFOs cannot be wholly accounted for by perceptual distortions or human behaviorial problems. Recordings and physical evidence are strongly against this, but these have also been subject to the complex psychology of controversy. The Persinger Theory is, at best, a limited theory with several weak points, not the least of which is why images in the perceptual field would be configured against an undistorted background (not characteristic of your standard variety hallucination). So, could we have an article in psychological defense or something along the line as to why some UFOs could be alien artifacts? One more point, please. It is amazing to me that after 25 years I can still be reading some of the same arguments against ETH. The speed-of- light barrier is glibly invoked by even the learned as a formidable opponent to space travel. The interpretations by pro-relativists and anti-relativists leave plenty of room for doubt on the subject of the speed-of-light. And where is the imagination? Einstein said it was more precious than knowledge (doctrine). How about Holt's hyperspace jumper? There may not be only other planets in our universe that serve as habitats for ETs, but other worlds in other universes, dimensions, or time zones. So I would like to see articles on UFO-related speculative science, articles that will fire the imagination. William F. Hamilton III Glendale, Ariz. Persinger On Right/Wrong Track Editor, I would like to comment on Robert Wanderer's article on the Persinger Theory (No. 184, June 1983). Persinger, in interpreting the implications of his observation that a statistical correlation exists between seismic acitivity and UFO reports, has speculated that this is evidence for the UFO phenomenon being spurious, claiming that geological stresses associated with earthquake activity create electromagnetic atmospheric anomalies, exemplified by luminosities, which strongly affect the temporal lobes of bystanders. I don't think these speculations are mechanistically likely, for several, reasons. In a pair of books (Atlantis Reconsidered, Exposition Press, 1981 and Insights into Prehistory, Exposition 1982) I have advanced a sizable body of evidence to support the concept that deep-earth energy is the most logical power-source for UFOs. There is no remotely comparable power-source in nature to the concentrated nuclear forces existing at mass-dense depths such as the lower crustal level. If it is accepted that deep-crustal- energy-tapping UFO-control stations could exist, it seems likely UFO reports would be frequent in that vicinity. If, in a given time period, the deep-energy- tapping activity waxes, it would seem logical that crustal instabilities and seismic activity would result. Persinger's observation that seismic activity tends to follow on UFO reports, therefore, could be explained by an alternate hypothesis: the reports were actually related to UFO activity, and the seismic disturbances were a by- product of such activity. Granting that Persinger is an authority on neurological matters, I would still like to know on what basis he proposes that electromagnetic exposures particularly affect the temporal lobe (psychomotor areas) of the brain. Electroshock therapy has long been used to treat depressed persons by stimulating brain activity, but as far as I am aware, these patients do not commonly relate abduction fantasies. In fact, magnetic-biological research indicates that steady magnetic fields principally stimulate the activity of the brain stem and mid-brain, especially the so-called \"reticular activating\" center, which activates consciousness and the facultative areas in the cortical lobes generally. Thus, magnetic exposures usually result in a general enhancement of brain activity, increased alertness, etc. UFO debunkers, always after us believers to \"get our act together,\" would do well to follow their own advice most of the time.

That's the claim reported in the November 22 issue of NATIONAL ENQUIRER. According to reporters Charles Parmiter and Henry Gris, the space child was rescued from a crashed spaceship and studied at the Institute before succumbing to a massive infection. The ENQUIRER'S November 29 issue tells of a mysterious craft which buzzed the town of Melton, Australia, for a five-hour period on July 22, 1983. John Magor, the former publisher/editor of CANADIAN UFO REPORT and author of OUR UFO VISITORS, has produced a new book which will be of interest to many readers. The title, ALIENS ABOVE, ALWAYS, emphasizes what Magor calls the \"enduring nature of the UFO presence.\" Although he draws on UFO reports which may be familiar to most researchers, the author attempts to discover the purposes behind UFO visitations. Magor points out that the public's seeming lack of interest in UFOs may stem from the fact that they have been exposed to so many bizarre reports. To discover the motives and identities of the UFO occupants is, Magor thinks, more important and more fascinating. In making such an attempt, he covers a wide range or subjects, including UFO abductions, cattle mutilations, Bruce Cathie's \"power grid\" theory, etc. Magor suggests that much of the UFO activity may be due to the presence of UFO bases within our solar system. This is a point often ignored by many researchers and it is good to see it being given the consideration it deserves. ALIENS ABOVE, ALWAYS has a good collection of photographs and illustrations, as well as an index. Nicely presented in softcover format, copies are available at $11.50 each (autographed upon request) from John Magor at P.O. Box 758 - Duncan, B.C., Canada V9L 3Y1. Persons wishing to obtain hardcover copies of James M. McCampbell's book, UFOLOGY, should be advised that only a few remain.

Director's Message, from page 2 the ones involved in a cover-up.\" In order to make such an absurd statement, Phil apparently chooses to disregard the 4,000 government documents released under the Freedom of Information Act to UFO researchers and 35 years of UFO investigations that have been reported in UFO journals and the news media. If you failed to read my editorial comments in the September 1983 issue concerning the philosophy of the Mutual UFO Network and the MUFON UFO Journal, I invite you to do so. This philosophy will be incorporated into the editorial policies of future issues of the Journal. I would also like to bring to your attention that Lucius Parish, Co-Editor of the .U.F.O. Newsclipping Service, Route 1, Box 220, Plumerville, Arkansas 72127, included four pages of legal-size listings of hardcover books, paperbacks and periodicals, with the November 1983 issue of his UFO Newsclipping Service, that are for sale on a first-come, first-served basis. This is an opportunity to expand your UFO library and obtain that rare copy that you have sought. We would like to welcome a new consultant to MUFON who attended the recent University of Nebraska Conference. He is Webster S. Robbins, Ed. D., residing in Lincoln, Nebraska. He is primarily interested in the historical and cultural aspects of the phenomenon, while leaning toward the philosophic aspects where very little of this discipline appears in the literature. *** The renewal response from former subscribers to Frontiers of Science to the MUFON UFO Journal has been very gratifying. The Mutual UFO Network assumed the responsibility for fulfilling the remainder of issues due subscribers to Frontiers of Science when this magazine declared they were unable to continue publishing for financial reasons. The MUFON UFO Journal and three other magazines have accepted this obligation, without any remuneration, as a form of advertising and to provide exposure of our Journal to a potential source of new subscribers. Each of you has had an opportunity to evaluate the significance of the work being done by the Mutual UFO Network in our endeavor to solve the mystery of the UFO phenomenon. We invite each one of you to complete and return the blue renewal form when it is enclosed with your magazine. Upon receipt of your annual subscription/ membership dues, you will be invited and encouraged to take an active role in applying your individual interest and expertise in our quest to resolve this baffling enigma. Some of you have already received invitations from our MUFON State Directors to participate in statewide activities and to meet and get acquainted with our State officers and investigators. By joining MUFON and subscribing to the MUFON UFO Journal, you will have an unique opportunity to apply your talent to solving the greatest mystery of our time. 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE w Walt Andrus After a meeting of the Committee for the MUFON 1984 UFO Symposium and your Director on December 18, there may be some revisions in the slate of speakers previously announced. Hosted by MUFON Metroplex, the 1984 annual symposium is still scheuled for June 8, 9, and 10 at the Northpark Inn in Dallas, Texas. Lindy Whitehurst has accepted the chairmanship of the symposium committee, relieving Rev. G. Neal Hern of this time consuming responsibility. Mrs. Cynthia R. Hind, continental co-ordinator for Africa, living in Zimbabwe, and Mrs. Marge Christensen, State Director for Massachusetts have been added to the list of speakers. In the July 1983 issue of the Journal (No. 185), I alluded to a possible release of a film this fall by the Pentagon to the Public Broadcasting System (PBS) explaining their role for justifying the intelligence agencies cover-up during the past 35 years. Two motion pictures being produced at that time on UFOs have been terminated before completion, ostensibly for financial reasons. This is a very disappointing turn-of- events, when public education concerning the UFO phenomenon is so essential. There is presently no reliable assurance that the Pentagon will be releasing a film to PBS in the immediate future to defend their position as I formerly speculated. The book Clear Intent co- authored by Larry Fawcett and Barry J. Greenwood, published by Prentice- Hall, Inc. (New York), will definitely be released during April 1984. It should provide a strong impact upon the public by disclosing what the government knows about UFOs, provided that they would read their own documents. Larry Fawcett had an original dust jacket of their book Clear Intent at the recent University of Nebraska Conference. The television program ABC Nightline filmed extensively at the University of Nebraska Conference on November 11 and 12 in preparation for an evening special on UFOs. Dr. J. Allen Hynek and Walt Andrus were scheduled to appear live during the interview segment of the program. Your Director drove to Omaha, Nebraska, on November 14 to the studios of KETV, the ABC outlet, to produce the live segment for that evening per instructions from Steve Lewis, the producer. Unfortunately, the UFO program was pre-empted by the Greyhound bus driver strike. As of December 15, Steve Lewis still planned to air the UFO special. However, an exact date has not been scheduled. Since ABC Nightline is a news program, current news dictates their schedule. The Japanese newsstand magazine Twilight Zone, published by World Photo Press, featured the Nebraska Conference speakers in its January 1984 issue in glorious color as well as black and white. In addition to photographs of the speakers, their cameraman obtained unusually good reproductions of the speaker's slides projected upon the auditorium screen. Considering that the photographer and writers did not leave Lincoln, Nebraska, until November 14, MUFON received an air mail copy of their magazine on December 12. Don Berliner, a free-lance aviation writer and author, was commissioned as the prime writer for this feature. Living in Alexandria, Virginia, Don is also a member/subscriber of MUFON. The fine photographic work is credited to Naoki Yamaguchi, information officer of J.S.P.S. and assistance in writing the article to Shinichiro Namiki, President of J.S.P.S., who are both MUFON members from Japan. A few years ago, Mr. Namiki led a contingent of five J.S.P.S. members to Seguin, Texas, to visit MUFON headquarters. It was a delight to renew our friendships at Lincoln. Junichi Yaoi, Director/Producer for Nippon Television Network Corporation, Tokyo, Japan, a recent MUFON member, attended the Nebraska Conference and plans to use some of the material presented in his future TV programs. As previously announced in the October issue of the Journal, casette tape recordings are available of each of the speakers at the University of Nebraska Conference for $5.00 each by writing and making a check payable to MUFON, identifying which speaker or speaker's recordings you are ordering. (Ericon, Inc. of Redford, Michigan has contracted to provide the casette tapes). The Delphos, Kansas, landing trace case of November 2, 1971, remains as one of the most significant CEII events where MUFON investigator and researchers have been directly involved. Your Director seized upon the opportunity to revisit Delphos on November 10, 1983, while driving to the University of Nebraska Conference, to obtain an update on the environment twelve years after this unusual event. In an upcoming issue of the Journal, I will share this important information with our readers and refute some of the unsubstantiated statements made by Philip Klass concerning this case in his recent book UFOs The Public Deceived (Chapter 15). I must admit that the title of Phil's book is most appropriate — he is still trying to deceive the public. Mr. Klass' latest tirade occurred on Thursday, December 8, 1983, when he appeared on KYW-TV (Channel 3) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with Larry Bryant on the program \"People Are Talking.\" The subject was \"Do UFOs Really Exist?\" In a letter to Ms. Julie Hitner, the program moderator, from Charles J. Bednarik, MUFON Field Investigator in Philadelphia, Mr. Bednarik expressed his displeasure that Phil Klass tried to monopolize the program by constantly interrupting, correcting, and criticizing Larry Bryant. In the meantime, Phil was providing misinformation such as his statement \"...like Larry Bryant, the UFO researchers and investigators are the ones that are hiding the truth and evidence from the citizens; that we are (continued on page 19)"}]
