Renewed Interest in Old Newspaper Accounts Prompts Further Investigation Our readers are all aware there has been a great deal in the Press for the past several months about that \"mysterious 1&97 airship n that is supposed to have crashed in Aurora, Texas in April, 1597- It is not a new story, of course. That \"mysterious 1397 airship\" has been the subject of many magazine articles and much conjecture ever since the year it was reportedly seen all over the United States. Lucius Parish, of the SKYLOOK staff, is doubtless its best known his- torian and had that title before SKYLOOK came into being. This magazine published a series of articles on the airship, based on research by MUFON Directer Walter H. Andrus, beginning with the May 1971 issue and continuing through December 1972. These were newspaper accounts of the airship seen in the midwest statesand we asked our readers to send in their reports of the airship being seen elsewhere. In the June 1971 issue of SKYLOOK we included the Texas crash story (sent by staff member, John Schuessler) which has been the subject of much recent interest. Feeling sure you're all familiar with it, we 1 11 just quote briefly from the April 19, 1S97 \"Dallas Morning News\":—\"Aurora, Wise County, April 17.—About 6 o'clock this morning the ea^rly risers of Aurora were astonished at the sudden appearance of the airship which has been sailing throughout the country. It sailed directly over the public square, and when it reached the north part of town, collided with the tower of Judge Proctor T s windmill and went to pieces with a terrific explosion, scattering debris over several acres of ground, wrecking the windmill and water tank and destroying the judge r s flower garden* The pilot of the ship is supposed to have been the only one aboard and while his remains are badly disfigured, enough of the original has been picked up to show that he was not an inhabitant of this world * * the town is full of people today who are viewing the wreck and gather- ing specimens of a strange metal from the debris. The pilot's funeral will take plsce at noon tomorrow.\" Bill Case, Aviation Writer for the Dallas \"Times Herald,\" became interested when new investigation of the crash and grave site was under way and has been running a series of articles on developments, along with doing a fine job of researching the old stories and locat- ing living witnesses of the event. His articles have been widely re- produced all over the United States and abroad. His goal, as is MUFON 1 s, is simply to learn whether an airship actually did crash, followed by burial of a pilot, and whether there is any real evidence to indicate the airship was other man made. Old newspaper clippings show a number of experiments with aircraft were under way at that time. It is interesting to note thst while some of the \"old timers\" interviewed believe the story of the crash a hoax perpetrated for the purpose of giving Aurora some publicity, others have come for- ward to state they either remember the 1&97 crash or/and remember hearing about it from their parents* Pieces of metal have been found at the crash site. One has been analyzed by a MUFON consultant as aluminum alloy, not developed in the United States until 1908-1910 and not commercially until 1920. It had been subjected to great heat which indicates an explosion could have taken place, as reported. However, the age of the metal is important.

While staring skyward £t the clear, ster-studded sky, almost directly overhead, Tice spotted two fast moving lights, one following in the other ! s path sbout 3 to 5 degrees apart. The lights were white, both alike in appearance and glowing with a sort 'of misty halo close around them. Their speed seemed faster than a jet, yet there uas no visible trail, no noise, no pulsating of the light, color chanfe, speed variation of maneuvers. The objects passed overhead in a perfectly straight line heading in a south by southeast direction, following a line slightly east of the highway, seemingly headed in the direction of Chico and Sacramento, though the actual altitude was difficult to establish. Estimate would be roughly 15-20 thousand feet. The objects were in sight from approximately directly overhead to about 40 degrees above the horizon, where they gradually disappeared from sight. The time interval was approximately 10-15 seconds which would rule out meteorites; speed too fast for jets and satellites, which pass out of the sun's light at high altitudes. The objects are consider- ed unknown,, Illinois Observers Watch Moving, Rep! lights -- Terry and Jeff Turner, of Beckemeyer, Illinois, were attempting to observe nebula through a telescope on the night of April 21, 1973, at 7:30 PM, but stopped as the sky became overcast. Suddenly four brilliant red lights appeared through a gap in the -clouds in the western sky. The lights were in loose formation, quite like the bowl of the Big Dipper, and moved slowly in a southerly direction, occasioncly stopping and hovering a few seconds. Eventually they disappeared into a low cloud cover 0 The lights shone steadily most of the time , although they appeared to twinkle slightly at times. Their brightness was estimated to be of at least -3rd magnitude, and the altitude was approximately 10 to 15 degrees end their range from J to 1 mile. One light wes observed momentarily through a telescope (2\"-75X) and appeared as s. white light source 0 i here was no moon end few stars, if any, visible. Bright Lights Over Chicago Suburb - Patrol Cer ^ip-.hts Stop — Hundreds of northwest suburban / Chicago/residents saw an unexplained display of nine bright, pulsating lights that hovered in the sky the nirht of May 10, 1973- The lights which prompted hundreds of phone calls to police, sometimes zoomed off at a high rate of speed. At other times, they remained stationary for as long as 25 minutes. . Most observers, which appeared to report independently of each other, agreed they were hovering over the Ned i3rown Forest Preserve at Int. Hwy. 90 and 111. Hwy. 72, in unincorporated Elk Grove Township. Illinois State Police, in attempting to explain the sighting, said the lights were from planes landing at O'Hare International Airport, and the National V.'eether Service tended to back this assessment, ex- plaining that a combination of fog and atmospheric conditions at 0 T Hare caused the illusion c However, few who sew thi.-, display would accept this theory, explain- ing that the lights would move at times and remain stationary at others.

Then we saw them rise up again to about 1,000 feet.\" We said there was no noise from the lights. \"I wasn't scared, but curious. On the other hand, if they landed next to me, that would be something else.\" The sighting report appeared in the Racine Journal-Times, May 11, 1973 and in Chicago Today. May 11, 1973. In the Chicago Tribune, May 13, 1973> the additional information was given that Sgt. Schmidt said the lights on his patrol car stopped working during the sighting. \"The whole 30 minutes the lights were there, the emergency lights on the squad were inoperable. But the minute the lights disappeared, the lights worked again,\" he said, \"This stirred Dr. J. Allen Hynek 1 s interest even more, since reports of temporarily inoperative electric lights usually accompany the sight- ing of a bona fide UFO,\" the Tribune stated* Dr. Hynek was quoted as saying he wasn't sure what the lights were and planned to investi- gate. Hynek, who was the Air Forde's expert on UFOs for 20 years, before the specially funded project was closed in the late 1960s said: \"I keep saying we ought to set up a center to investigate these sightings and find out what's really happening.

Circle-Shaped UFO Shoots Eire Ballsl On Sunday evening about 7:30, May 27, Mrs. Bill Shultz, of the Porter Mill Springs fisning resort on the Lake of the Ozarks near Sunrise Beach, Mo., saw a UFO shaped like a circle in the northern sky above the lake. She and two other witnesses watched the object for a half hour or more and during that time, three \"fire balls\" were ejected from the object* It was stationary, and there was no sound. It was learned later that others along the Lake had also seen the strange object. Editor T s Comment: We know Edna Shultz well, as Porter Mill Springs is our favorite fishing spot, and we can assure >ou this is no \"fish story.\" Ob.lect Hovers Over Cemetery Mrs. Mary Ellen Becker, of Beckemeyer, 111., was driving home (west) from Carlyle, 111., on a cloudy evening in January, 1973 (doesn't recall exact date) when she saw a silvery colored object hovering over the Beckemeyer cemetery.

This story is related to us by Lieutenant- Major C. Nencescu, a specialist in radar: \"On Saturday, December 9, 196? at about 9:30 p.m. I walked out of the station to watch a plane that seemed to be preparing to land. To my com- plete amazement I realized that the f plane 1 sjood at a fixed point in the sky. What attracted my special attention was the dimensions and the ex- tremely bright light. In a few moments this object, which was stationed at 30 to 40 above the northern horizon be^an to dive towards the earth very rapidly and within a few moments it Began to again gain altitude at a much slower speed until it had reached its initial point in the sky. ^t executed slow horizontal movements to the right and to the left. It stopped and again fell towards the earth. This series of maneuvers were repeated many times. Because this object seemed to be extremely strange, as well as its unusual luminosity and movements, I called it to the atten- tion to many soldiers at the station who, with me, watched it until 11:30 p.m. when it departed toward the north. All during this time I observed it with the naked eye and with the instruments available to me. \"Its form was not that of a disc, but rather a truncated cone, probably because of a partial illumination. I am positive that it was not any nat- ural phenomenon nor an optical illusion, but rather a flying machine which possessed its own power and light sources. \"In addition to this, on December 4, 196?, a fellow officer, Lieutenant- Major Sorin Georgescu observed the same type of phenomenon at the same lo- cation and the object performed the same type of maneuvers until 4 a.m. in the morning. This time, however, the object had the form of a disc. In the following days the poor visibility did not allow for clear observations with the naked eye.\" DATA-NET HAS CEASED PUBLICATION We are sorry to announce the March 1973 issue of DATA-NET is the last one.

They were traveling in a car on Chelwood Street towards Botanical Road. The child, age 11, believed she could see a dark, cylindrical form behind the twin lights which were bigger and brighter than a motor vehicle's and seemed to pulse or flicker. The car was stopped and the two watched the objects which seemed to hover above a multi-unit State housing building next to Monrad Park. After five minutes, only one light was seen and it then climbed until hidden by a cloud and had disappeared when the cloud movedo While watching the twin lights the witnesses saw an NAG aircraft come in from the south, behind the lights. Saturday, May 12, D. H. Driver end his teen-age daughter, Keitha, were in a car when they saw a brilliant glowing light in TeMatai ^oad between 4:45 p.m. and 5:05 p.m. jt was described as a hovering, stat- ionary light about 10 degrees elevation over the Tararuas. Later it sped away, climbing steeply without a sound. It was to the east of the obser- vers* > and no form should be seen. Milson Airport reported thst two NAG aircraft arrived from the south during the first sighting and would have been westward of the witnesses. Mr. Fulton stated he learned a senior airport official was at the Hokowhitu Golf Bourse on May 12. He saw a bright light to the east near the time of the Driver sighting and identified the light as a private aircraft with a landing light on. Two separate confirmations of the May 10 and May 12 sightings were received by Mr. Fulton on May 15th after the reports appeared in the Evening Standard. Mrs. J. M. Bayly, of 109 Linton St., was driving down Main Street near Napier Road, May 10, when she spotted two brilliant lights hover- ing in the sky. She stopped the car and studied the lights. They did not appear to be far off and were just above the buildings. While watching, the lights \"suddenly spun off\" and \"shot away,\" climbing to a higher altitude where she lost sight of them. J. P. Charlton, of 5 Marne St., also reported seeing two or three brilliant lights stationary in the sky to the southwest as he rode his motor cycle in Princess Street shortly before 3 p.m. May 10. n e be- lieved the lights to be projecting from a cylindrical object which was just above the buildings. Mr. and Mrs. A. W. Krivan, 109 Linton St. were motoring towards Palmerston North in the late afternoon, May 12 when, just south of the Longburn flyover, they sighted a brilliant suspended light source in the direction of the Tararuas. It wes \"extremely bright\" they said, much brighter than an aircraft landing light, and it appeared to be suspended between two layers of clouds. Suddenly the light disappeared. They saw no aircraft and Krivan, who works for NAG, would not accept that it was a plane. A Mr. Ferguson called the \"Evening Standard\" and also reported seeing bright lights about dusk, May 12, due north of the foot of the Aokautere Forest Hill Road. He thought it might be a plane from the Ohakea Airbase but officials at the Airbase said there were no planes in the air at that time.

The three first thought they were watching the American Skylab, but the speed and the fact of two separate bodies seemed odd. One of the lights suddenly broke away from the other at an angle of 60 degrees and disappeared over the Tara- ruas. The flight was completely soundless and the witnesses told Mr. Fulton they had never seen anything like it before. Mr. and Mrs* R. Parsons, of Rangiotu, sighted a brilliant star-like object crossing the sky early Thursday morning, May 17, coming out of the west and disappearing over the Tararuas. It was in view from 6:25 a.m. to 6:30 a.m. \"From the description given me, and in view of the sightings of the United States Skylab being reported from Christchurch and Wellington, I felt that this is the very likely explanation,\" Mr. Fulton saido On Sunday, May 13, R. Roberts and his 12-year-old son, of Rongotea, saw two bright, stationary, alternating lights in the sky. Roberts and his son were in a car traveling south near Tangimoana. The lights were seen towards Himatangri and appeared to be two brilliant white objects, one above the other which brightened alternately and were observed for three minutes before vanishing. Roberts, who lives close to Ohakea Air Base and had worked for NAG as an engineer for eight years, was certain the lights were not an aircraft strobe flashing light. U. S. Astronauts Saw UFOs Mrs. Marie Bluhm sent us an interesting article featuring NICAP from the May 26 edition of the Fort Wayne, Indiana \"W'ews Sentinel\" and we quote the NICAP Director, Stuart Nixon, who in speaking of UFOs says: \"Perhaps the most convincing set of witnesses were the U. S. astro- nauts who orbited the earth on Gemini missions. An Air Force report lists three sightings: 1. Gemini 4, Astronaut McDivitt. Observation of a cylindrical object with a protuberance. 2. Gemini 4, Astronaut McDivitt. Observation of a moving bright light at a higher level than the Gemini spacecraft* 3. Gemini 7, Astronaut Borman saw what he re- ferred to as a ! bogey ! flying in formation with the spacecraft,, \"McDivitt's cylindrical object was not only sighted, but photo- graphed with both still end movie cameras.

The Dominican newspapers began to be interested in the UFOs—unidenti- fied flying objects—when hundreds of telephone calls sounded in their editorial offices from persons who, frightened in the majority, said they had seen flying saucers passing through the sky. There were then the most spectacular versions. From children, students, o!4' people, soldiers, doctors, and newspapermen, the pages of the daily papers began to offer to their intrigued readers information about the frequent^and mysterious appearances of those strange objects. Because of the issuing of many of those versions the unbelief which at the beginning was created in public opinion gradually was converted as the days passed into a serious preoccupation. \"Are we being the vic- tims of a gradual invasion from outer space?\", commented the newspaper man, Miguel Franjul, of the Listin Diario (Listin Daily), after having contemplated with his own eyes one of those strange sights. In the edition of October 13, 1972-, Frenjul wrote: \"I saw last night, and with me hundreds of residents of the capital, what to all appearances seemed to be an unidentified flying object, or flying saucer, as people say* This time the restless luminous point did not do as many tricks as on previous occasions, nor did it disappear with the same speed as before, but rather held steady during several minutes, before it was lost from the view of hundreds of persons.\" Franjul maintains that the object was seen the night previous to the publication of his article by various witnesses, among them the execu- tive director of the evening newspaper Ultima Hora (Latest Hour), Vir- gilio Alcantara. He added that in the down town Independence Park, in the heart of the business district of Santo Domingo, were gathered \"more than one hundred persons in order to watch the strange object.\" He de- scribed .it as \"luminous, very luminous.\" Five days later, the night of Tuesday, Oct. 17, 1972, hundreds of persons from the village El Fundo, near Bani, to the south of Santo Domingo, gave testimony of having seen descend a strange flying object which then took off in the middle of an intense light (see Listin Diaro for Oct. 19, 1972, an article signed by the newspaper man Hector Herrera). El Fundo is a humble village of farmers dedicated to the raising of mani, tobacco and yucca on a small scale, situated a few kilometers from the central mountain range, where there are mountain peaks of up to 3165 meters above sea level, such as Duart Peak, the highest in the West Indies* Herrera T s story, as it came out published in the Listin Diario is as follows: \"Two friends, a sergeant of marines and a primary school teacher were standing talking on the edge of the highway opposite a small bar. It was seven o ! clock at night approximately, when coming from the mountains to the northeast appeared an object which was giving off intermittently a greenish light. \"It was going at a velocity similar to that of an airplane. The object came to a halt a few meters from where the sergeant and the professor were standing, settling down behind a group of three tall palm trees. \"On arriving at the site it descended to the ground and remained be- tween one and three minutes, turning off the green lights and leaving on an intermittent red light. No sound whatsoever was noticed. The ob- servers mentioned did not dare to approach until the object ascended again slowly. According to the witnesses the object ascended oblique- ly in the southwest direction. The operation from descent to depart- ure lasted approximately ten minutes.\" 1°"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"A third witness, an old women only identified as \"Cion\" by the Listin Diario. gave the same testimony. In another story on the same event, the newspaperman Danilo Rodriguez Dominguez, of the Listin Diario. said on that date that the object was the size of an automobile, citing witnesses who were present. In the edition of Friday, Oct. 23, 1972, the Listin Diario surprised its readers with the most sensational of all the versions which had circulated previously in this country, concerning the presence of flying saucers, and beings from other planets. This time an insur- ance agent, described by the newspaper as a serious person little given to imagination, claimed to have conversed with a crew member of a saucero The newspaper identified the witness as XX in order to avoid thus his name. The witness was traveling along a solitary highway from San Cristobal in the vicinity of La Granja and La Unphu after just completing a sale. It was nine o T clock in the morning. On the highway appeared a man who made signs that he should stop. XX observed the person had on a kind of uniform and thought he was going to be searched. He slowed down and stopped, leaving the motor running. The man approached. He wore a kind of overall of a light green color with brilliant tints. The suit covered his feet. He wore neither boots nor gloves nor pockets nor arms nor insignia. There was a kind of watch on his left hand. h e identified himself as \"M. F. n The newspaper did not give the name as it involves a well known Dominican who mysterious- ly disappeared more than 15 years ago. According to the story, M. F. said he supposedly drowned with two other persons and wqs rescued by \"whet you call a UFO. I was rescued by those two persons over there because of my knowledge of radio tech- nology and my intelligence.\" There wasn't room for the other two per- sons inside the module, he said. The \"two persons over there\" were men of more than six feet in height,slender, dressed in identical garments. XX said. They had short chestnut hair and e light skin like Chinese. They remained silent with their arms crossed, observing the scene. M. F. pointed out to XX the apparatus in which they had arrived. It had the size of en automobile, the shape of an American football and a nickelplated surface. The conversation continued for about five minutes during which the \"two other men\" were looking around. In reply to a question as to their home, M. F. replied, \"Supposedly from Venus.\" M. F. then told XX to leave because \"they\" were leaving and not to worry if his car would not function because it would return to normal, As XX continued on his route, he saw the three approaching through the bushes toward their oval vehicle. The event occurred Sept.- 22, 1972. Editor T s Note: Our readers do not need us to point out the \"holes\" in the story of the above encounter. We have included it as a matter of interest.

It was about 3:30 on the afternoon of July 16, 1969. A rainstorm had just passed over, and the sky was clear. Sylvia, age 10, was in the house reading when she heard a noise outside. She ran to the front porch, facing the east, and saw a grey \"top hat -shaped\" object with rounded edges and bright lights on the bottom. The object appeared about to land and was about 3 feet above a well, ten feet from the Annola child. A bright silver-like light came from the bottom of the object and the child was blinded for a half hour. When the object left, she stumbled into the house and told her mother what she had seen. Mr. Annola was working outside at this time and saw nothing unus- ual, but did remember hearing some odd noises from the house area, but assumed someone was outside working at something and gave them no further thought. On hearing his daughter 1 s story, he examined the site of the near landing and found trees were burned and leaves dried up and surmised the object must have taken off over the trees. Two days later he discovered shredded metal in some trees a quarter of a mile from the house, and said his son suffered a rash on one arm after handling the metal. The Edmonton UFO Society later had the metal analyzed and found it to be of the same composition as cast aluminum. The same metal was discovered in trees of nearby farms. Immediately after the sighting, the Annolas noticed their German Shepherd dog was missing and after a half hour's search found him hiding and whimpering in the field south of the house. He resisted being taken home. A short time after the sighting police cars approached a point on the road near the Annola home and it was learned a man had driven off the road in his car and was dead. It was thought death was caused by a heart attack. Mr. Annola wondered if there could be any connection between the sighting and the man's heart attack* —From the Files of John B. Musgrave, MUFON Director for Alberta, Canada Power Failures and UFO Sightings - In the period July 15-24, 1971, a series of power failures occurred in the Province of Quebec, at the same time UFOs were seen, some over and near the electric stations of the Hydro-Quebec. The city of Montreal and its surroundings were particularly hit by the black outs. Many reports of UFOs were made and printed in the area newspapers. On July 29, 1971, the \"Montreal-Matin,\" a French-Canadian newspaper published en account released by Hydro-Quebec stating, \"The black out which has paralysed a large sector of the Province of Quebec, July 23, 1971, might have been caused by lightning damages to a power line of 750 K.V.\" Because'no regional storm or thunder-storm was registered, and it was a period of very nice weather--\"sunny and clear\"— together with the many UFO reports of the same period, Claude MacDuff, of Montreal, and other investigators were unable to accept lightning as the cause of power failures. [ One of the most interesting cases Mr. MacDuff and his co-workers investigated took place on a potato farm on the Saint-Dominique Road at Saint Hyac inthe. ! The farmer T s wife said the sighting was in mid-July, probably the 20th. She was in the living room, and looked out of a window to the west. (Continued on Page 13} 12"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Report from Canada. Continued from Page ?2_ \"Suddenly I saw at about 2,000 feet from the house, ajbove two trees, five huge red lights that seemed to rotate all around a solid dark body. I never saw a thing like that in my life. It was not lights from a tractor or other machinery. . I tried to call my husband, but he was taking a shower and did not hear me. •*- came back to the window and the object was still there. Then the lights separated. x t was lights of a bright, clear red that stood at about 15 feet high above the trees. There was no motor noise or other sound. Then the lights went off and that was all. Later on, I re- ported to my husband what I have seen, but he did not believe me and said that I had probably a kind of hallucination.\" The day following the sighting the farmer was going through his field to check plant conditions and to his surprise fround \"tracks'* at the site of the lights seen by his wife. Shortly afterward, as the case became known to Mr. Mac Duff and his group, they went to the farm and saw the tracks. The following is the report made by Mac Duff to a newspaper which published his statements: \"We went to the potato field with the farmer. We saw, at about -1,300 feet from the house ( and not above the trees as said the woman; this could be understood if we consider that, accord- ing to her angle of vision through the window and in the direction of west, she first thought that the ojbect had hovered over the trees. But, in fact, it is more probable that it hovered some yards farther, exactly where were found the tracks), A first perfect circle, 11 feet diameter, where the crops and the potatoes have been completely crushed and burned in the center, and less burned around the circumference; this was caused, probably by an intense heat- source, even if the farmer ! s wife did not see other luminous or colored light. At about 450 feet east of that circle, another circle of sameproportions had the same characteristics and signs. \"In conclusion, the traces left, the perfect geometrical form of the circles, the burnt vegetation and crops, the farmer T s wife version of her sighting of the 20th describing what she saw the evening before her husband discovered the tracks—all these facts in the details cannot be rejected, because there are too many other facts supporting the evidence of the event. The investigators came to the hypothesis that it would seem probable that the object came to a stand still at a height of about 15 feet, and had burnt a cir- cular surface with some type of energy or radiation.\" The farmer asked that his name be kept secret as he wanted no publicity and did not want curious crowds trampling over his potato field. Editor's Note: This was condensed from a lengthy article by our Canadian reporter, and we are sorry space does not permit using the entire account. Other UFO sightings were investiagated and listed, giving ample reason to believe there could be a connection with the power failures at that time. As Mr. Mac Duffpointed out, the electric compeny's explanation was rather weak and not a positive statement— \"might have been caused by lightning\" and no further explanation was made to the public.

The Arabs de- picted this constellation as a kneeling giant. Hercules is a tre- mendous constellation ranking fifth in size. The upper portion, or head of ^ercules, is often called the Keystone. In the northern section of n ercules is one of the wonders of the skies. This is the great globular cluster M-13, the finest cluster of its type in the northern heavens. Exploring this region with a pair of good binoculars, the observer should heve no difficulty in locating M-13, an incredibly wonderful sight. The vast swarm of thousands of glitter- ing stars is an amazing spectacle. The distance to M-13 is about 25,000 light yesrs. Approximately 100 globular clusters are known in our galaxy.When the distribution of these objects is plotted, it is found that they form a nearly spherical system and that the center is identical with the center of our galaxy. This discovery was made by Dr. Harlow Shapley. M-92 is another, but less significant, globu- lar cluster in this region of the sky. n ercules culminates on July 23 at 9 PM.—Mark Herbstritt.

There is insufficient carbon in this sample of aluminum alloy to con- duct a carbon 14 test, therefore it is not possible to pin point the year of manufacture.. MUFON and Dr. Allen J.

These artifacts should be mailed to MUFON consultant. Earl Watts, 515 Falling Leaves Drive, Duncanville, Texas, 75116. It is hoped with these additional samples, full analysis may be conducted in metallurgy laboratories. We might add here that we have been going through our folder of airship clips, sent in by our readers, and find we have a number dated after April 1397, in which that \"mysterious airship\" is still being seen and reported, including a sighting over St. Louis in May of 1397.

The NATIONAL ENQUIRER leads the field in terms of both quant- ity and quali'ty. The June 17 issue told of mysterious rings and circles found in Australia which are believed to be UFO landing sites. As in the Delphos, Kansas case, the ring soil is \"heavily loaded with a silvery white substance.\" The June 24 ENQUIRER reported on a UFO flap which has been taking place in the vicinity of Lexington, Alabana since the first of the year. It sounds like Piedmont all over again! The ENQUIRER for July 1 contains an interview with former astronaut Gordon Cooper, giving Cooper's opinions on UFOs, life in outer space and theories of Erich von Daniken. - The May 27 NATIONAL INSIDER devotes space to Aurora, Texas and the \"crashed airship\" story from 1#97- This particular case is really \"hotting up\" currently, as our British counterparts would say. - NATIONAL TATTLER for May 27 has a full page report on the Piedmont, Mo. flap, re- hashing the major events. An interesting article (and a couple of previously-unpublished UFO photos) appears in the June issue of SCIENCE DIGEST. Dr. J. Allen Hynek provides this survey of the current UFO scene. The July issue of SAGA carries an article by Stanton Friedman and B. Ann Slate which is extremely interesting and mot informative. It deals with the research of Marjorie Fish, an Ohio school teacher who has app- arently duplicated the \"star map\" allegedly seen by Betty Hill on board the UFO in which she and her late husband were examined by UFOnauts. This is original research at its best and Ms. Fish T s map was a prime contender for the NATIONAL ENQUIRER'S $5000 reward for outstanding UFO evidence* A few months ago, we reviewed a booklet called GRAVITY DOES NOT EXIST, written by James Carter. Mr. Carter has now revised his publication and has changed the title to read GRAVITATION DOES NOT EXIST. His comments about UFOs will probably be of most interest to SKYLOOK readers * ^e calls them \"macrobes\" and considers them to be a form of space life. This theory can possibly be applied to a few UFO sightings, but certainly not to the majority of them. If you are interested in an unorthodox treatment of the theory of gravitation, you might like Mr. Carter's book- let. J-t is available for $1,00 from Universal Expansion Press - P. 0.

Schurmacher's TRUE TALES OF TERROR contains a couple of stories concering UFO encounters e The first could easily be a reworked version of the famous Antonio Villas Boas case from Brazil, as it in- cludes all the same ingredients—capture of a young man by the occupants of a landed UFO, forced sexual relations with a female humanoid, etc. Although this particular incident allegedly occurred in Arizona, it seems odd that no UFO organizations or publications have published anything per- taining to it previously. Therefore, I think it would be well to regard this account with considerable suspicion. Schurmacher's second UFO story re=hashes the sighting by Captain James Howard and his crew while flying the Atlantic in 1954. This case will be familiar to most researchers and nothing new is added here.

This is merely a reprint of GODS, DEMONS AND UFO T S, with a title change and a new cover, in order to cash in on the popularity of von Daniken's CHARIOTS OF THE GODS?. Still another book dealing with \"ancient astronauts\" is T. C. Lethbridge's THE LEGEND OF THE SONS OF GOD. As the title suggests, the book presents Lethbridge's theories as to the identity of the mysterious \"sons of God\" mentioned in the sixth chapter of Genesis. Considerable familiar ground is covered—or at least, it will be familiar to anyone who has read the books by von Daniken and other writers. However, Lethbridge contributes information which has not been included in the other writings. His background in archaeology and parapsychology stands him in good stead when discussing possible visits by extraterrestrials in the past. As an example, he discusses the many \"stone circles\" and other enigmatic sites scattered throughout Britain. It is his theory that these circles served as \"accumulators\" of bio-electric energy which could be used as navigational beacons by the ancient visitors from the skies. There is no dogmatism here, as Lethbridge freely admits the speculative nature of the ideas he puts forth. Even so, the book is quite thought-provoking and I would rate it as one of the better books of its type. It is available from Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd. - 9 Park Street - Boston, MA 0210S for $5.95. Dr. Robert S. Ellwood, Jr. is the author of RELIGIOUS AND SPIRIT- UAL GROUPS IN MODERN AMERICA, a survey of contemporary cults and sects. This is quite a scholarly tome and will be of interest to anyone wishing to know more about religious, metaphysical and occult organizations, A chapter entitled \"The Descent of the Mighty Ones\" contains material relating to various contactee groups, such as the Aetherius Society, Amalgamated Flying Saucer Clubs of America and Understanding, Inc. A section is also devoted to the Giant Rock Space Conventions, sponsored by contactee George Van Tassel. Elwood seems to compare any and all claimed experiences with \"shamanism,\" a primitive form of mystical aware- ness. In this respect, the presentation leaves something to be desired. Also, nothing is mentioned about UFO research, per se, thereby leaving the unknowing reader with the impression that the only people interested in UFOs are the contactee groups. As Dr. Ellwood is a Consultant to APRO, this omission seems doubly inexcusable.
