Allen Hynek at times, have long argued that there is more to the UFO mystery than first meets the eye, let alone the other four senses. Increasingly, modern physics conveys much the same message about matter and energy, the accepted, but still yet to be completely under- stood building blocks of the universe. Things, in other words, the UFO phenomenon included, are not always as they seem. U fology, like any field of science, can be seen as one facet of the investigation of the unknown. As with physics, not only is it important that reliable field data be collected, but the equivalent of theoretical physicists are also needed to review that data, to suggest theories that attempt to make sense of it, and to search for clues to link aspects of the UFO phe- nomenon to research in other fields. After all, it is just as likely that discoveries made from studying UFOs may be relevant to other fields of science as vice versa. This article therefore compares ideas from several seemingly unrelated fields of research with the aim of seeking new perspectives on the UFO enigma. OTHER DIMENSIONS It is often claimed that UFOs may access other dimen- sions.'\" Numerous close encounter reports detail tem- poral or spatial anomalies such as UFOs seeming to be larger inside than outside' 2 ', or aliens claiming that time passes more slowly at home.' 2 ' Budd Hopkins refers to UFO invisibility and distorted time during abductions' 3 ', and Russian researcher Dr. Rem Varlamov reports a quartz timepiece that sped up when placed within a UFO landing circle.' 4 ' All these reports, including tem- poral anomalies, reveal that UFOs may have some form of dimensional technology. What exactly are dimensions? It is generally accepted that we live in a world with three spatial dimensions plus time, making four dimensions in all. Strictly speaking, science regards space and time as blending together to create a four-dimensional space-time continuum. A one- dimensional world is very limited and would consist of just a line. A being who inhabited such a world has only two degrees of freedom, whether to go what we could call left or right along that line. To visualize a two- dimensional world one has to imagine pulling that line at right angles to itself to get a flat surface, such as a piece of paper. An inhabitant of such a world now has four de- grees of freedom, the original left and right, plus what we could call up or down, as is illustrated by a simple two-dimensional object, the square, which has four sides. Of course our two-dimensional inhabitant could actually meander wherever they wished on their piece of paper, but in geometric terms, their position could be given at any time by just two coordinates, as with a simple graph. To visualize three dimensions one needs to imagine moving our two-dimensional piece of paper at right an- gles to itself. For example a two-dimensional square IANUARY 1995 NUMBER 321 PAGE 3"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL A tour-dimensional perspective allows you to fly right past, over, or around any solid barrier in three dimensions. A being from the fourth dimension could reach into you and literally tickle your ribs! No wonder philosopher Henry More speculated, as far back as the seventeenth century, that spir- its were fourth-dimensional beings. moved at right angles to itself produces a cube. We now have six degrees of freedom, as illustrated by the fact that a cube has six sides. When creating a four-dimensional object things start to get interesting. What one does is to imagine moving our three-dimensional, six-sided cube in a direction that is at right angles to all its current dimensions. What we get then is an object whose borders are eight cubes, thus giving an inhabitant of such a realm eight degrees of freedom. Most people have great difficulty visualiz- ing four, or more, dimensional objects, but that does not mean that such objects cannot exist, or that there are not rules that govern their shape and behavior. The branch of mathematics that studies the properties of objects in multi-dimensional space is called topology. One of the theoretical spaces they work in is called hy- perspace, so for example a four-dimensional sphere is called a hypersphere. Some of topology's conclusions about the interaction of objects in various dimensions may be of interest to us. UFOs are frequently described as changing shape or jumping about rapidly. They may disappear only to reappear a short distance away, and sometimes they seem to split into parts. An object that moves from a realm of, for example, four-dimensional space (we are for the moment ignoring time as a di- mension) through the perceptual view of a human that knows only three spatial dimensions, could look very puzzling. This is perhaps best understood by imagining a simpler situation, one with fewer dimensions, but where the principle remains the same. Imagine a two-di- mensional being inhabiting a flat world, such as the surface of a cup of coffee, while you, a three-dimen- sional being, lower a sugar cube into that coffee. What would the two-dimensional being see as the cube passed through its limited perspective? This quote by K. C. Cole, in an article entitled \"Escape from 3-D, Visiting Higher Dimensions,\" describes it well: \"Two-dimensional beings living on the flat plane could not perceive the three-dimensional cube falling through it. Instead they would see a ghostly apparition appearing out of nowhere, metamorphosing into a series of different geometric shapes, then disappearing, just as mysteriously, back to nowhere. The various shapes that appear in the two-dimensional plane seem to be unre- lated: a resident of the plane would have difficulty imag- ing how they could all add up to the same figure. Yet to a resident of a three-dimensional space, the connection is obvious.\" (5) If we transpose this example back to higher dimen- sional space and imagine a shape more complex than a sugar cube, we can see that it may be relevant to some UFO sightings. We can also understand how difficult it would be for us to work out what was going on during such sightings. Topology may offer other insights to ufologists. Consider this further quote from the same article: \" ... a four-dimensional perspective allows you to fly right past, over, or around any solid barrier in three di- mensions. A being from the fourth dimension could reach into you and literally tickle your ribs! No wonder philosopher Henry More speculated, as far back as the seventeenth century, that spirits were fourth-dimen- sional beings.\" <5) This comment about spirits is interesting because it could also refer to alien abductions. It would imply that locked windows and doors are no obstacle to an intelli- gence that has access to more than three spatial dimen- sions. Furthermore, by being able to see around three-di- mensional barriers, such a being would appear to us to have X-ray vision. Could it be that the universe does have more than the three dimensions that we are able to see, and that some advanced intelligence, wherever it may come from, might be making use of the extra spa- tial manoeuverability this would give them in order to travel and/or abduct us? Although topologists do their dimensional modeling on the computer screen, their mathematical conclusions would nevertheless be correct if such extra dimensions did exist. To explore that possibility let us look at some ideas from the new physics. THEORIES OF EVERYTHING & STRING THEORY One of the aims of the new physics is to try to unify two of its major theories. These are Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, which deals mainly with gravity, the force that shapes the largest structures of the uni- verse, and secondly, Quantum Mechanics which, at the other end of the scale, deals with the forces that rule the atomic and sub-atomic world. Such a unified theory would be called a Theory of Everything (TOE) and would need to link what physics now regards as the three fundamental forces in the universe. These are gravity, the strong nuclear force, and electromagnet- ism. (It used to be thought there were four such forces, but recent work has appeared to link electromagnetism with the weak nuclear force thus reducing the number to only three.) One contender for TOE status is called Superstring Theory which suggests that all sub-atomic particles, and perhaps even the structure of space-time itself, are composed of minute string-like loops of energy with no internal structure of their own. By vibrating or oscillat- PAGE4 NUMBER 321 JANUARY 1995"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL ing at different frequencies these strings actually be- come the various sub-atomic particles that make up atoms, which, in their turn, make up what we look on as solid matter. This is a highly simplistic explanation, and the details of the theory are still in dispute among the world's leading theoretical physicists. However what is interesting about Superstring Theory, from our point of view, is that the highly complicated mathematics of the theory comes out most neatly if it is assumed that the universe has 10 dimensions. So where are the six dimensions that remain unac- counted for once you subtract our visible three dimen- sions and time? The most common answer provided by nine of the world's most eminent physicists in the book Superstrings: A Theory of Everything? seems to be that these extra dimensions are somehow rolled up so tightly that we cannot see them. They have undergone \"spontaneous compactification\" (6) , which in physics jar- gon seems to mean that they don't really know where they are. However, while there is no clear agreement as to exactly how many extra dimensions there may be, these physicists do not say that the evidence points to there not \"being any extra dimensions. If Superstring Theory is correct, and the universe does possess extra dimensions, it would be quite possi- ble that an alien intelligence, especially one that is more advanced than we are, has learned how to use them. There is little dispute that the UFO intelligence is more advanced than we are, as is illustrated by the cliche that says that: \"If they find you before you find them, they are more advanced than you are.\" Until we explore the possibility of extra dimensions more thoroughly, we could continue to be vulnerable to abduction, or any other form of alien exploitation that is facilitated by access to them. Rather than the \"missile gap\" of the cold war, we may need to close the \"dimen- sion gap.\" We could speculate therefore that ongoing re- search into this matter might help explain why the UFO phenomenon seems to be so highly classified by the military and intelligence communities. Let us see what other evidence there is that might help confirm the ex- istence of extra dimensions. POLTERGEIST ACTIVITY & CONSCIOUSNESS Poltergeist activity, or \"Recurrent Spontaneous Psychokinesis\" (RSPK), as US-based parapsychologists prefer to call it <7) , is a term that covers a wide range of phenomena. For example it may refer to crockery, or other household objects that inexplicably start flying across a room. These objects sometimes display aero- dynamically impossible trajectories as they float slowly through the air, do right angle turns to avoid hitting people, or suddenly stop and lower to the ground. In an- other example showers of stones appeared out of thin air, and intermittently rained slowly down onto a roof. <8) It used to be thought that this rather alarming activity was caused by mischevious spirits inhabiting an unseen JANUARY 1995    NUMBER 321 There is little dispute that the UFO intelli- gence is more advanced than we are, as is illustrated by the cliche that says that: \"If they find you before you find them, they are more advanced than you are. realm that coexisted with the visible world. However, some aspects of RSPK suggest more than just an unseen hand, as is illustrated by the following example from the autobiographical book The Link by Matthew Manning. All sorts of strange psychokinetic events occurred around Manning during the 1970s, starting while he was a 12-year-old schoolboy in England. Many of these events were witnessed by the staff and students at his boarding school, and by his family at home. Manning's astonishing psychokinetic abilities have been investi- gated by numerous researchers, including Nobel Prize winning physicist Professor Brian Josephson, who is reported to have claimed that they warranted a reexam- ination of the nature of reality. (9) Manning writes: \"One afternoon I lay in a bath at school. Facing me was a window which was firmly closed. On a ledge at the plug end of my bath was an assortment of soap and plugs. From my position, there were in front of me firstly the taps, then the ledge, and a few feet behind the ledge was the window. As I day-dreamed in that direc- tion a plug rose up in the air. This startled me. It was the first poltergeist phenomenon I had witnessed for some weeks and the first time for many months that I had ac- tually seen an object move. The plug then shot towards the window with as much speed as though someone had hit it very forcefully with a bat. In fact I thought in a flash that it would shatter the window. To my amaze- ment, it passed through the window and disappeared from sight. The window remained firmly closed and unbroken. A few minutes later I found a plug, which I presumed to be the same one, lying on the ground on the other side of the window.\" 19 ' Recalling that topology says that a three-dimensional object is not a barrier from a four-dimensional perspec- tive, this incident, and several others that Manning de- scribes, suggests that RSPK has access to one or more extra dimensions. This suggestion is not much different from saying that RSPK operates through a hidden realm. However, this still raises some puzzling questions. An extra dimension might explain how the plug got through the window without breaking the glass, but not how the plug was propelled, nor what connection the event might have with Manning. It is in exploring answers to these questions that other links between UFOs and RSPK, apart from the possibility that they may both use extra dimensions, seem to emerge. The first link is that we don't know what propels UFOs or RSPK, but it may turn out to be a similar type of energy that is capable of operating through some, as PAGES"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Claims for a link between mind and matter are hardly new. Mystics and yogis have been making them for years, but when in- dependent research by physicists, engi- neers, parapsychologists, and ufologists starts to support such claims they become much harder to ignore. yet, unseen dimension. Research into the national secu- rity ramifications of access to this energy source might again help explain the secrecy concerning the existence ofUFOs. Secondly, though on a different scale, there is a marked similarity between the astonishing behavior of objects in RSPK and UFOs, which are frequently de- scribed by pilots as seeming to play mischevious games with them, materializing and dematerializing, chang- ing shape, and displaying astonishing, aerodynamically impossible, manoeuvers such as veering away at the last moment, and doing right angle turns at high speed. Thirdly, it has been suggested that a connection may ex- ist between UFOs and the mind. For example, some pilots describe cockpit electronics that fail just as they were about to use them while chasing a UFO. Numerous abductees describe aliens that speak to them in their heads\" 0 ', and others claim an increase in psychic powers on their return. (2) To acknowledge this puzzling link Jacques Vallee has suggested a UFO encounter cate- gory called \"Reality transformation.\" (U) Similarly, para- psychologists today link RSPK with the psychic subli- mation of emotional tension within the unconscious mind of a teenage member of the family concerned.\" 21 In Matthew Manning's case, while he was at first baffled by the suggestion that the psychokinetic events around him could be linked to his mind, he gradually came to accept this, and learnt to bring the activity largely under his control. How is this possible? What connection could there be between the mind or consciousness, and matter, espe- cially when it is at a distance, or even possibly in another dimension? The dynamics of this link are currently the subject of some very interesting research. As we read earlier in relation to Superstring Theory, modern physi- cists, who might deny that their work had anything to do with consciousness, are burrowing deeper into the sub- atomic realm to try to discover what matter is actually made of. There they are discovering that the deeper they go the more it appears that matter isn't made of anything solid at all. In an article called \"God and Science\" in the Australian Commission for the Future's magazine 21c, we read the following: \"If new concepts in physics . . . are correct, then there is ultimately no matter and there are no forces. As physicist Paul Davies has put it, there is just 'empty PAGE 6 eleven-dimensional space-time curved into patterns ... the world, it seems, can be built more or less out of structured nothingness.' In other words, force, matter and indeed everything that 'exists' are simply manifes- tations of space and time 'dancing' with themselves ... The insoluble problem for the old physics was how mind and consciousness came to be in a universe of material. The new physics allows for the possibility that consciousness is not simply something that emerges when matter becomes very complex, as in living crea- tures. It allows the possibility that mind is present in some elementary form in the most fundamental entities of creation. Likewise it sees no real boundary between living and non-living.\" II3) This type of research is not new, though its publica- tion might be. In June 1981, the US House of Representatives' Committee on Science & Technology claimed that research had revealed what they called an \"interconnectiveness of the human mind with other minds and with matter.\" This \"interconnectiveness,\" they said, \"would appear to be functional in nature and amplified by intent and emotion.\" 041 They then men- tioned the relevance of that research to national de- fense, especially in the light of the acknowledgment that the then Soviet Union was . . . supporting such re- search at a far higher and more official level.\" (I4) This might explain why details of such research are not widely known. Results of some publicly available research into this subject can be seen in a 1993 TV documentary by Professor David Suzuki called ''Mysteries of the Mind,\" where he interviewed Princeton University's Dean Emeritus of Engineering Robert Jahn, whose work has repeatedly shown that, simply by concentrating, many people are able to affect sensitive mechanical and elec- tronic devices. One of the goals of Jahn's research was to investigate the possibility that a group of tense, con- centrating people, such as in the control room at a satel- lite launch, might have an adverse affect on the sensitive electronic equipment involved, thus leading to a costly and potentially dangerous malfunction. As Professor Jahn says, this apparent connection between mind and matter would logically lead science to reconsider whether the basic physical modeling of the universe is totally correct.\" (l51 C laims for a link between mind and matter are hardly new. Mystics and yogis have been making them for years, but when independent research by physicists, engineers, parapsychologists, and ufologists starts to support such claims they become much harder to ignore. Though this research is still in its infancy, what seems to be emerging is not just the possibility that consciousness may be able to penetrate to the sub-atomic realm, where there may exist access to other dimensions, but that, at their most fundamental levels, consciousness and matter may actually merge. This bold suggestion is the basis for NUMBER 321    JANUARY 1995"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL a theoretical model put forward by science writer Michael Talbot in his book The Holographic Universe.\"® Basing his \"Holographic Model\" on the work of quan- tum physicist Dr. David Bohm, neurophysiologist Dr. Carl Pribram, and several other fields of research, in- cluding ufology, Talbot suggests that there exists a pre- dominantly sub-quantum level of reality where matter, energy and consciousness blend into a single field. Calling this realm the \"Implicate Order,\" in recogni- tion of the ground breaking creativity by Bohm in works such as his Wholeness and the Implicate Order ( \"\\ Talbot details a wealth of scientific evidence to suggest that it interpenetrates, or \"enfolds,\" what we know of as every- day reality, which he terms the Explicate Order. It is some of the attributes of this Implicate Order that may be beginning to provide a scientific explanation for some of the \"strangeness\" of both the UFO phenomenon and the paranormal. NON-LOCALITY One inspiration for the Holographic Model was the in- vention of the hologram. A true hologram has a dual na- ture. From one perspective it looks like a jumble of in- terference patterns on a piece of film, but when illumi- nated by a laser beam, a three-dimensional image ap- pears. Furthermore, if a true hologram is cut in half, or smaller, the whole of the original image remains. It may lose overall quality, but not a part of the image, showing that the image is stored on the film in what is termed a \"non-local\" fashion. In other words every lo- cation on the holographic film stores data about the whole of the image, not just a part of it. Although this concept of \"non-locality\" may seem paradoxical, espe- cially when applied to more complex and dynamic sys- tems, it may nevertheless prove to be of tremendous sig- nificance to physics and ufology. Talbot's Holographic Model suggests that the con- sciousness-like nature of the Implicate Order stores in- formation about reality in a holographic, or non-local, fashion, which can be seen as another way of saying that that realm has multi-dimensional properties beyond the four-dimensional constraints of the Explicate Order. This is reminiscent of the \"compactified\" extra dimen- sions of Superstring theory. As we shall see, the ramifi- cations of this possibility are extraordinary. For example, ufologists will be pleased to hear that research into \"non-locality\" has lead to the downfall of one of science's most cherished beliefs: the claim that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. This has for years been the reason put forward by astronomers why UFOs could not be extra-terrestrial. Traveling from, for example, a galaxy one million light years away would take a million years, even if one could reach the speed of light, so the whole suggestion is out of the question they have claimed. Physicists are now reluctantly admitting that research into the non-local, or action-at-a-distance, properties of JANUARY 1995    NUMBER 321 Ufologists will be pleased to hear that re- search into \"non-locality\" has lead to the downfall of one of science's most cher- ished beliefs: the claim that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. the quantum realm are revealing that they were wrong. For example in Scientific American of August 1993, we read that: \"Experiments in quantum optics show that two distant events can influence each other faster than any signal could have traveled between them.\"\" 81 This baf- fling discovery is not just limited to the sub-atomic realm. In an article by John Gribbin entitled \"Atomic telepathy is faster than light,\" in the British New Scientist magazine we read that German research \". . . has shown that in theory any pair of atoms can commu- nicate with each other faster than the speed of light.\" Gribbin comments that \"The best interpretation of the evidence so far seems to be that we should not think of any object, not even a single atom, as an 'isolated sys- tem.' \" (19) I t does not take much imagination to realize the enor- mous implications of this research. While it may not mean that a solid spacecraft can now travel faster than the speed of light in the Explicate Order, it does suggest that within the Implicate Order, information may appear to do so. Why? Because if the Implicate Order is somehow accessible by consciousness, that may mean that on occasions the mind too can operate non-locally, or multi-dimensionally, as is explained by psychologist William Braud: \"These bits of evidence suggest that below the surface there is this vast network of interconnection, and that perhaps it is a quirk of attention that we think of our- selves as separate. They are reminders that the whole system interacts in a very complicated way . . . which suggests that the mind itself may be non-local . . . and that it may be that the mind is spread out over space and over time.\" (I5) In an attempt to see if consciousness can operate away from the body, Dr. Peter Fenwick and a team from the British Institute of Psychiatry are conducting an experiment to see if hospital patients, who claim to have had out-of-body experiences, are able to see objects placed in their coronary care units in such a way that they could only be seen if they had left their bodies. As Dr Fenwick says: \". . . if we can show that mind is, in fact, non-local and that you can have experiences be- yond the brain, then you have got a whole new ball game.\" <20) Taking this perspective further, Professor Suzuki quotes astronomer James Jeans as suggesting that the en- tire universe can be seen as a vast thought rather than something mechanical.\" 5 * Likewise, Jacques Vallee sug- PAGE7"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL gests that we should perhaps think of reality in terms of \"information theory\" rather than physics. 1 \" What link might there be between our minds and the Implicate Order? In computing terms what is being sug- gested is that under certain circumstances we may be able to switch our minds from their normal PC mode, and learn to access the equivalent of some vast main- frame, or universal mind, where the hardware, matter, blends into, or may actually be made out of, its own soft- ware, a form of non-local consciousness. Such a system would be a computer designer's dream. However, it may be wrong to think of information \"moving\" through this sub-atomic realm at super-luminal \"speeds,\" be- cause these terms imply space-time constraints. It may be better to regard the Implicate Order as a huge multi- dimensional processor whose data is equally, and in- stantaneously, accessible via consciousness from wher- ever you are in the Explicate Order. We could visualize our familiar four-dimensional realm, the Explicate Order, somehow nestled, or enfolded within, or as a sub-set of, a much more complex non-local system, the Implicate Order, and that, under certain circumstances, our minds can effect a link between the two Orders. If this is so, then it is to be expected that an ad- vanced intelligence, (and ourselves, if we have the sense to continue research into the matter), would have de- veloped a technology that exploits the multi-dimen- sional advantages of that system. To humans, such tech- nology would resemble magic, but we only have to imagine explaining the workings of a television to some- one from several hundred years ago to grasp the point that \"magic\" is just a label for what we don't yet un- derstand. It is interesting to note, for example, that information transfer between any two points in the Explicate Order using the mind in non-local, or \"Implicate Order mode,\" describes what has traditionally been called telepathy: an ability that is repeatedly attributed to aliens. We may need a paradigm shift to grasp the true nature of both reality and the UFO phenomenon. Let's specu- late a bit. We are told that, at its core, \"solid\" matter isn't actually solid but instead appears to resemble the fluid- ity of consciousness. Matter from the perspective of the Implicate Order can therefore perhaps be seen as a form of \"frozen\" consciousness. This may give us the beginnings of an explanation for the materialization and dematerialization of matter by the mind itself. UFOs are frequently described as seeming to materialize or de- materialize, and parapsychologists have for years re- ported the materialization of solid objects seemingly out of thin air during outbreaks of poltergeist activity. <8 ' Mathew Manning details several such occurences (9) , as does the literature on shamanism and native magic. (21) Likewise Professor Erlendur Haraldsson was unable to detect any sign of fraud in his extensive investigation of the Indian spiritual leader Sathya Sai Baba's almost daily materialization of small trinkets or holy ash for his followers. <22) It may be relevant here to note that the best descrip- tion of the group of people to whom paranormal powers such as telepathy, clairvoyance, healing, bilocation. tele- portation, levitation, and the materialization of matter are most often attributed, is that they are experts in the ex- ploration of consciousness. Mystics, yogis, shamans, saints and contemplatives, whatever their religious or so- cial backgrounds, all advocate the interiorization of consciousness in order to achieve some sort of tran- scendental breakthrough. Could it be that, though they traditionally have difficulty verbalizing it as such, what these people are doing is learning to merge their normal consciousness with that of the Implicate Order? The switch from PC to mainframe mode again? Does that mean that UFOs that seem to appear from nowhere are materializing from the Implicate Order, or moving out from other dimensions? The difference may be purely semantic. However, the mere thought of such advanced stealth technology would certainly make an Air Force general drool, and once again could help ex- plain the secrecy surrounding their research into UFOs. We can then speculate as to what an advanced intel- ligence might be able to do using Implicate Order, or di- mensional, technology. This might enable a solid craft to remain invisible to us while it carried out part of its mission, yet by moving into our spatial dimensions, to appear when it wished to be noticed. By selective di- mensional control such a craft might be larger inside than outside, and abductees might seem to us to reappear in an instant despite experiencing a lengthy, and largely invisible, abduction. Residual effects from such a craft might also explain variations in the speed of timepieces placed in landing circles. Further research into non-locality may help us un- derstand that a craft under intelligent control could be projected to materialize instantly wherever that intelli- gence wished it to go, for example from one galaxy to another, without any normal physical restraints. Would that craft be real? Would it be solid? Would it leave marks on the ground? Could it be detected by radar? The answers would have to be yes. But, in the twinkling of an eye, or should we say mind, it could become \"unreal\" and disappear to return from whence it came, because from the non-local perspective of the Implicate Order, the other side of our galaxy and planet Earth are actually in the same place. British UFO researcher Jenny Randies writes about the abduction phenomenon that: \"These beings ... have harnessed the power of consciousness to cross the gulfs of space.\" (23) This may be the future of space travel for us, although it may have been used by other intelligences to visit us for ages.

PART 1 UFOs in the Outback are like UFOs everywhere — which means weird. By Keith Basterfield INTRODUCTION: A unique Australian CE3/CE4 event has been slowly re- searched and documented since it occurred near Belgrave, Victoria in August 1993. It involves 5 people in 2 independent groups, in 2 mo- tor vehicles, who were party to a very close encounter one night outside of Melbourne, the capital city of the state of Victoria. One of the witnesses, a woman who wishes to be known only by her real first name of Kelly, contacted my colleague Bill Chalker of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, after failing to locate anyone in her home state to talk to about the experience. Bill referred her to John Auchettl of Phenomena Research Australia, who lives in Melbourne. John interviewed Kelly and her husband Andrew (pseudonym) and then was successful in locating and interviewing the other 3 witnesses. Kelly subsequently visited Adelaide, South Australia, where I live and we were able to spend a weekend ex- ploring her portion of the event. Her husband Andrew, although acknowledging the event and confirming the marks on Kelly's body, did not wish to participate in an investigation. I was fortunate to be able to sit in on a hypnotic re- gression session with Kelly and an Adelaide psycholo- gist with whom I work, in an attempt to unlock an ap- parent period of missing time. So, part 1 of this article is Kelly's account of the Belgrave incident. Part 2 will look at what the other party recalled and some interesting physical traces found at the site, courtesy of John Auchettl's investigation. KELLY: THE EMERGENCE OF MEMORIES: On the 16th of September 1993, Kelly and her husband Andrew were attending a barbecue at the home of a friend of theirs in the state of Victoria. During the course of the evening, somehow the con- versation turned to the subject of UFOs. The host was very skeptical of the subject of UFOs. Kelly was sur- prised to hear her husband comment about the two of them having seen a UFO some weeks before on their way home from the house of a friend. He recalled Kelly pointing out the object and them seeing it hovering in the middle of the road, and thought it looked like a football field all lit up. You see, Kelly didn't recall seeing any- thing like this. This claim of her husband's continued to. trouble her over the following weeks as she couldn't work out why her husband should have made such a thing up. The first of October 1993 saw them driving, during the day, through Fountain Gate, an outer Melbourne suburb, in the state of Victoria, then onto Belgrave and up to Monbulk. They were on their way to visit the house of the same friend where the barbecue was held. After passing the Fountain Gate shopping centre, quite out of character, Kelly thought to herself that an open area to the side of the vehicle would be a good place for a UFO to land. She doesn't know where this thought came from. At this point, a feeling of dread passed through her — a fear which had no apparent cause considering the set- ting they were in. Unbidden memories emerged of an episode from the night of the 7/8th August 1993. She found herself wondering how on Earth she could have forgotten the highly unusual, very disturbing episode. AUGUST THE SEVENTH/EIGHTH: On the seventh of August 1993 Kelly and Andrew were travelling to their friend's place to celebrate her friend's daughter's 18th birthday. On the outskirts of Belgrave, just after dark, Kelly, who was in the passenger seat was startled to glimpse, for 2-3 seconds, a circle of round, or- ange lights sitting in a paddock. Andrew as driver, and travelling at about 100 km/hr, apparently did not see them, and Kelly, deep in thought as to what they could have been, did not mention it to Andrew for some five minutes. They then discussed whether or not it could have been an aircraft or a helicopter, but Andrew was not open to her discussion on the observation and the conversation about it was brief. After arriving at her friend's place Andrew told peo- ple what Kelly had seen, and Kelly received a ribbing from those present about it. There was even talk of little green men. Kelly and her friend then went off to play bingo and returned to the friend's place at about 11 p.m. After coffee and a chat Andrew and Kelly set off home. Although they did not look at a clock their esti- mate of the time of departure placed it as about 11:45 p.m. The normal duration of the trip home was about 90 minutes. Traffic was light on the road home and travel- ling down hill between Belgrave and Fountain Gate an object was again sighted. This time it seemed to be hovering above the road, at about twice tree top height, some 400-500m to their front. The bottom half of it was a grouping of circular, orange lights, while the top seemed solid. It was identical to the object Kelly had seen on the way up to their friend's. As they got closer to it, Kelly thought that there were figures visible in the lights and told her husband of this PAGE 10 NUMBER 321 JANUARY 1995"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL She still felt nauseous, sweaty, with head spinning. The same male voice, speaking as if addressing a crowd, said: \"We are a peaceful people.\" Kelly broke down and cried. observation. Andrew also looked at the object, which then took off at speed to their left. CLOSE ENCOUNTER: A couple of kilometres further along the road, a brilliant light was encountered which appeared to take up the width of the road, and was directly in front of them. Kelly needed to shield her eyes to look at it. Her heart was racing, and adrenaline pumping. The couple talked about what they were seeing. Suddenly, within a split second of driving towards the light, the next memory was of sitting in the car, but feeling relaxed, with a normal pulse and no adrenaline flow. The two of them were puzzled as to what had happened to the light towards which they had, seconds ago, been driving? Kelly commented that she felt as if she'd experienced a black out. Discussion on this ap- parent \"missing time\" continued over the next half hour, with Kelly certain some time had passed and Andrew suggesting that she'd been daydreaming. However, both felt they were suffering unexplained stomach pain and that the car smelt of vomit. Upon arrival home they checked the time and the clock showed that it was 2:30 a.m., whereas it should have been about 1:15 a.m. AFTEREFFECTS: Before going to bed Kelly went to the bathroom, and found a red, triangular mark beneath her navel and a small \"cut\" on her bikini line similar to a laparoscopy marking. This cut seemed only a couple of days old. She knew immediately what the \"cut\" was as she had un- dergone exploratory surgery previously. Neither mark had previously been there. In addition, although not due for her menstruation, she had started to bleed. The unexplained bleeding continued for 3 1/2 weeks resulting in her becoming ill to the point of needing hospitalization for an infection of the womb. She found out that the normal causes of an infected womb was ei- ther a self-terminating pregnancy or an infection brought about following surgery. A pregnancy test proved neg- ative and she had not undergone recent surgery. The doctor however, concluded that she must have been pregnant, thus leading to an infected womb. MORE MEMORIES: What you have read so far were the initial memories re- called. Over a period of a few hours more memories emerged which broadened the recollection of events of that morning. These memories emerged as a series of unfolding flashbacks, e.g., one was of bending down in the car to pick up her handbag, another was of standing in the middle of the road. She'd get a 30-second piece of recall, then nothing, then another short recall. As they continued to drive towards the light, upon turning a bend in the road, it transpired that the object was on the right hand,side of the road and at ground level. At the spot where the encounter occurred the road takes a curve around a gully, and it is possible to see the location from along a one Km stretch. As they halted their vehicle Kelly observed that an- other road vehicle had come to a halt, some 100 metres behind them, back down the road, with a number of people in it. Andrew and Kelly, who stopped to pick up her handbag, got out of the car and walked across the road, and stared into the gully where the object rested. At this point they were some 5 metres away from the road, by a fenceline. The only landmarks they could see were a slight embankment and a little tree line. They stood awestruck and looked. After some 30 sec- onds, a figure came towards them. It was rather tall, black in colour, and was of a different shape to a human being, being too tall and skinny. She drew her husband's attention to the being and then Kelly decided to contact the being by thought, but was instantly flooded with a sensation of fear. From a distance of 100-150m the creature's eyes lit up red. Kelly stated to Andrew: \"They've got no souls,\" before screaming. She then became aware that there were in fact a num- ber of these creatures approaching, seemingly floating over the ground as if they weren't walking. The entities split up, some came towards Andrew and Kelly, and oth- ers went towards the other vehicle and its occupants. Kelly found her mind became intensely confused and she couldn't focus on anything. She really yelled to the other people: \"They're evil. They're going to kill us!\" Suddenly, there was a sensation in her stomach which caused her to fall backwards through the air, landing on her back (later an electric fence was located at this site and was perhaps the stimulus for this sensa- tion). She sat up, trying to remain conscious, feeling physically sick and catching her breath. She could not see—she felt blinded, but could hear her husband's voice nearby. He seemed terrified and spoke: \"Let go of me!\" In response came a male voice, which Kelly felt she had heard somewhere before but couldn't place it: \"We mean you no harm.\" Further dialogue ensued, at the end of which Kelly felt sick, put her head between her legs and passed out. Coming to, she was still sitting on the ground. She couldn't see but formed the impression that there were a lot of \"people\" around her. She still felt nauseous, sweaty, with head spinning. The same male voice, speaking as if addressing a crowd, said: \"We are a peaceful people.\" Kelly broke down and cried.

The engine would turn over but never actually start. Andrew would run down to see who was trying to steal the car but find no one there. then touched her on the shoulder, a gentle touch, but this sent her into a rage. The next conscious memory found her back in the car but unable to recall anything after seeing the light. HOME AGAIN—THE DREAM: Arriving home they went to bed and Kelly dreamed. In this dream she was on the ground, at the encounter site, sitting down. Her vision was clearing. She could see be- ings but only from the elbows down, she couldn't see the top half of them. She then saw her husband being led away down a slope to the object. Somehow, she knew that the creature leading him was female. Feeling en- raged she rushed towards the creature and grabbed her arm, only then to black out. Coming round, Kelly could see the grounded object and a middle aged woman was yelling \"Murderess\" to Kelly, who had a body at her feet. Kelly then felt an arm around her and she was led away. She next found herself in a small room, with a being present, whose face she could not see. The being informed her that she hadn't re- ally killed anyone but that they had used her sense of morality to overcome her fear. NEXT MORNING: When she woke up the next morning she could vividly recall the above dream. She noted there was also mud on the soles and heels of her shoes, and can recall having to jump over a muddy gutter to get to their viewing posi- tion on the side of the road. REGRESSION: This then was Kelly's conscious recollection, of en- countering an unusual object, of there being other human witnesses to the event; of seeing creatures and an ap'- parent period of \"missing time,\" some of which she be- came aware of. During a visit to Adelaide, South Australia where the author lives, she decided to undergo regression hypnosis conducted by a fully qualified psychologist. Although de- scribing her recollections of the 7th August in detail, she was unable to penetrate beyond the pre-existing con- scious memories. No abduction scenario emerged. SURROUNDING EVENTS: As with many other close encounter experiences, Kelly's 7th August event was not set in isolation. Below are de- tailed a few of these surrounding events. In about July 1993 she went on a spiritual retreat for 3 weeks. One night she was sitting, awake, on the edge of the bed, when she became aware of someone speaking to her. She listened intently and discovered she couldn't move an inch from her bed. There was some kind of power present. She found herself in shock, went as white as a ghost, and couldn't remember what she had heard. Shortly after the August event very unusual episodes would occur. The television turned itself on and off. Kelly would get up during the night to find the TV on even though they had turned it off before going to bed. It would then switch itself off. Light bulbs blew at a higher incident rate than normal. The VCR raced for- wards, backwards and ejected cassettes all by itself. At first it would happen and they'd catch it as they walked into the room. Later it did it in front of them. Their motor vehicle in the driveway tried to start up all by itself, with the doors locked and the \"kill\" switch on. The engine would turn over but never actually start. Andrew would run down to see who was trying to steal the car but find no one there. Although she regards herself as having been \"psy- chic\" prior to the event she feels that these abilities have been 10 times more evident since August. Several times, a small, orange ball of fire, the size of an orange has been seen to hit windows in the house. It came from nowhere and simply ran into the window, making a cracking sound. ENDPIECE: Kelly and Andrew's accounts are in themselves an in- teresting CE3 event with an apparent period of missing time. The marks Kelly found are also indicative of an abduction event, even though neither Kelly nor Andrew consciously recall such an experience. This encounter would intrigue in itself, but Phenomena Research Australia researcher John Auchettl was able to locate the other party of three people, who also independently recall observing the same entities and UFO that night, and more than that.

On Monday evening, 11/21/94, at 11:30 p.m., she and her hus- band decided to retire and Joanne, as is her custom, tucked her 5-year-old son into bed. To her surprise her son was awake and complained that the flashing lights in the sky through his east-facing window were scaring him. She looked out the window and observed a num- ber of objects moving and hovering in the sky that were flashing red/blue/green and white lights that she could not identify. She and her husband went outside, observed the objects, and being concerned, called the Newport Police Department. Patrolman Douglas Franklin responded to the call and was shown the ob- jects by the Charriers and reported the flashing objects to the Newport Police Dispatcher. The dispatcher im- mediately called the FAA control tower at Bangor International Airport, 25 miles to the east, and was in- formed that there was no traffic showing on radar at that time. Patrolman Franklin informed the Charriers that they were probably military helicopters on maneuvers and that the FAA tower would not tell them that.

The object quickly drifted noiselessly across the highway toward Newport. As the object passed over, the \"heater went cold and the ra- dio started receiving a radio station from across the country.\" Further discussion revealed that Pamela has had at least one other sighting in her life, as well as an experience in her bedroom years ago that could possibly be an abduction experience. Douglas Batchelder lives in Jackson and was present at Gladys French's house when I visited to view the ob- jects on 11/25. Douglas called me the evening of 12/1 indicating that he and Gladys's husband, Herb French, had just spotted a UFO on the Monroe to Jackson road. They were three miles from Jackson when they spotted a large object with flashing orange lights all around the bottom. They estimated the object to be about seven pickups in length and 500 feet above the road. It was moving and made no noise. They rushed home, grabbed a camera, and rushed back but could not find the object. James la Fountain is a carpenter who lives on the Monroe-Winterport line. James reported two sight- ings in the last week of November. The second report is of 11/21 at 6:00 p.m., as James was checking out the shingles on a new roof he was putting on his mother- in-law's house just up the mountain from his own home. From this roof he had a clear view to the east of a valley in West Winterport which is about a mile across. He said that a bright blue object came ex- tremely fast out of the north and flew south at no more then 100 feet above the fields in the valley. James is an expert on airplane identification, and said that the object he saw flew and looked like nothing he had ever seen before.

Mr. Jackson called me back the next evening and stated that he had viewed what I had described and that he had also wit- nessed something strange, even though he did not be- lieve in UFOs. He described it as looking like the trail left during fireworks rockets as they descend after ex- ploding. He stated it lasted for at least five seconds and came straight down. I indicated that it sounded like a meteorite, but that they were generally of much shorter duration and usually angled across the sky, so until further information was available, he had seen a UFO. He again stated that he couldn't have, because they don't exist. Ten minutes after talking with him a cab driver in Dover contacted me to tell me that he had seen three meteorites that evening. It was also re- ported that at 5:20 p.m. on 11/29 a fireball was seen from Boston up through Maine. It was estimated to be about fist-sized and travelling North West. It was felt that it came to earth in neighboring northern New Brunswick, Canada. On 12/2 this investigator was traveling east through Clifton, ME on Rt. 9 to the east of Bangor at 10:30 p.m. The sky was clear and full of stars and there was one very bright, multicolored flashing object SE of Rt. 9, approximately 30 degrees above the horizon.

A young man awoke about 1:00 o'clock in the mom- ing to find a bright light shining in his face and several figures standing around his bed. Suddenly, he found himself in a large, round, cold, seamless, metallic gray room having a reddish tint. He was sitting on a bench along with a blond woman and a man with tatoos. They seemed puzzled and unable to talk. He saw tables and cows also in the room, and beings were removing things from the cows. There were two types of beings. The larger ones, which seemed to be in charge of the others, were lizard-like, very muscular, had almond-shaped black eyes with yellow slits in them, and had several smile-shaped, parallel ridges on their faces.

About three hours had passed. Case investigated by MUFON's Kevin Bowman and Joseph Murek, Arizona. • LOG#941105S: CE-2, Currie, NV; Feb 28, 1980. Travelling to Idaho and carrying a pickup bed full of belongings held in place by a parachute tied down with rope and nylon straps which were attached to wooden sidebars, two men decided to stop and brew a cup of cof- fee at about 10:00 o'clock at night. Using a parachute in- stead of a tarp, they had checked the truck bed several times en route to make sure it was secure. The two made a quick trip to the woods and returned to start the coffee on a heating plate in the cab of the truck. It being cold, the steam soon fogged the inside windshield. When one of the men wiped the window, he saw odd shadows outside. Both of the men got out of the truck to see what was going on, and what they saw was a black shape the size of a house about 100 feet over them. It was roughly oval, but more like the outline of a potato. When they looked down to the truck bed. they saw the parachute torn to shreds and the ropes and straps broken or melted. One of them grabbed a stapler, and they quickly stapled the remaining pieces of the parachute to the sidebars, jumped into the cab, and started the engine to race away from the object. The truck engine coughed and sputtered as they drove, both the fuel gauge and speedometer were no longer functioning, and the object was following above them. The engine finally died as they were moving, and they suspected they were out of gas. The driver coasted on down the road while trying to JANUARY 1995 NUMBER 321 PAGE 15"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL switch to the second fuel tank, but the switch would not work. The passenger began helping with the switch and it finally worked. The engine started without sputtering, and the gauges began working. Looking above them, they saw the object had gone. MUFON Field Investigator Cinde Costello, California, reported the case. • LOG# 941110S: AN- 1, Rachel, NV; May 19, 1994. Having stopped along state highway 375 to check for a problem with the car, the two witnesses saw a red light with erratic motion. The red light disappeared, but they then saw three large, bright white lights in a row. They came closer, then dropped two yellow lights to the ground and disappeared a few seconds later. Two small, pulsating red lights then rose and passed just to the north of the witnesses. One of the red lights faded to white then back to red as the lights first separated then came back together before disappearing behind a sum- mit. Shortly afterward, one, then two brilliant white lights lit up at ground level in the vicinity of where the yellow lights had been dropped. One of the lights ap- peared to approach them before they both disappeared. MUFON Field Investigator Mary Zimmer, Florida, re- ported the case. The following cases were received from Jack Kasher, MUFON Central Region Director. • October 11,1994: A large, triangular-shaped object with dimensions of approximately 600 feet per side was spotted by five witnesses in two separate locations 25 miles apart, near Custer and Hot Springs, South Dakota. There were three lights flashing in sequence, and the object was silent. Near Hot Springs a number of dogs whined and barked when the object came into the area, and a witness saw the object fly directly over his house. Case investigated by Davina Ryszka, former South Dakota State Director, who was one of the witnesses. • July 21,1994: Two very bright, starlike lights were seen by two witnesses at about 10:00 PM near Hot Springs, South Dakota. One light was red, the other white. There was no sound, and the lights were stationary. The observers watched for five to ten minutes, until the lights disap- peared when a fast-moving jet plane entered the region. Investigated by Davina Ryszka. • Early 1950's and mid-1994: A gentleman from Buffalo, Wyoming recounted sev- eral sightings he had during the early 1950's in Wyoming and Washington state. Most involved blue lights, sometimes alone, sometimes multiple, in locations impossible to access by car. More recently, in mid-1994 he and a friend were driving near Clearmont, Wyoming when they saw an object that resembled a fifty-foot-long house with windows all the way across. It was on a hillside where there are no buildings. Investigated by Davina Ryszka. • October 17,1993: An 11-year-old girl and her cousin were in their front yard in Connersville, Indiana making a scarecrow. They heard a humming sound, and thought it was an air- plane. But the object stopped above them and the hum- ming sound stopped. They looked up and saw a saucer- shaped, silvery object, gray oh top with lights on the bot- tom. A \"fog\" came out of the craft, and three glowing white objects from the fog, one of which circled the field. The craft then moved out of sight after about three minutes. Investigated by Donald L. Worley. • July, 1977: Three young boys were playing outside in Connersville, Indiana during the evening, when they no- ticed three lights approaching low in the sky. The lights did not change position, and the boys could not see any stars between them. The 300-foot-wide triangle moved past at about 150 feet and about 25-30 m.p.h. Two of the boys fled, while the other fell backward and watched. It moved west, then disappeared. The sighting lasted about five minutes. Investigated by Donald L. Worley. • October 20-30,1992: A 41-year-old man was sitting on his porch at about 10:00 PM in Bloomfield, Indiana, when he noticed two low, stationary white lights in the east about 200-500 feet away. He felt that the object was triangular in shape. The two lights went out and four more appeared, red, green, red and green, right to left. The object moved slowly away after four to five minutes. Investigated by Thomas A. Vlaskamp. • April 17,1993: At about 9:45 PM the witness was driving north in Indianapolis, Indiana and saw a craft with a bright light in front and a blinking red light in back moving forward at a slow speed, at an altitude of about 500 feet. It changed direction and flew toward the witness, who then observed that it was white with no markings. The object was silent. Investigated by Will Ott. • September 9,1994: Thomas A. Vlaskamp was driving to work at about 2:55 PM near Bloomfield, Indiana, when he saw an ob- ject pass in front of him about 330 feet off the ground and moving at 300 m.p.h. The object made no sound, and appeared to be a gray, spinning disk. Immediately after this a jet plane roared by at the same altitude and speed. Both objects made a wide, sweeping turn to the east. A waitress at a nearby restaurant said she heard one jet fly by, but not two. Investigated (and witnessed) by Thomas Vlaskamp. PAGE 16 NUMBER 321 JANUARY 1995"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL SewScientist By Dennis Stacy O n November 28 of last year, the BBC2 Horizon program (roughly an equivalent of \"Nova\") broad- cast a special on alien abductions titled \"Close Encounters.\" It was hosted, or investigated, if you prefer, by Dr. Susan Blackmore, a senior lecturer in Psychology at the University of the West of England, Bristol, who in the past has tackled subjects like out-of-body and near- death experiences. Jenny Randies, writing in the Christmas 1994 issue of Northern UFO News (write editor Randies for sub- scription information at her new address: 11 Pike Court, Fleetwood, Lancashire FY7 8QF), roundly faulted the program on a number of points. For instance, says Randies, Blackmore \"set about presenting research pub- lished for years by various sensible UFOlogists (Keith Basterfield. Hilary Evans, Paul Devereux are just some) as if it were a discovery Horizon had made.\" Moreover, Randies continues, \"in promotion for this show (it achieved wide media interest in Britain, the USA and Australia) it came over as if Dr. Blackmore [had] carved out a rational path that nutty UFOlogists were too be- fuddled to seek.\" In conjunction with the program, Blackmore also had a cover article on abductions in the November 19, 1994 issue of the English weekly. New Scientist. You won't find any urologists you know quoted or credited in that article, either, although you will read such as: \"The BBC's science programme Horizon had asked me to investigate the origin of the latest American craze in crazy experience abduction by aliens.\" And later: \"Why do the aliens always pick Americans?\" Ironically, only two months before the program aired. Carl Nagaitis and Philip Mantle had published a book in England titled Without Consent (\"A Comprehensive Survey of Missing-Time and Abduction Phenomena in the UK\"), indicating that answers to even the simplest of questions are literally right under one's nose provided, of course, one is first interested in looking for them. The latter detailed some 40 UK cases, and it goes without saying that at least somewhat similar cases have been reported from France, Australia and other countries. Blackmore's New Scientist article. \"Alien Abduction, The Inside Story.\" concentrates mainly on the work of neuroscientist Michael Persinger at Laurentian University, Sudbury. Ontario. Persinger has long been tweaking peoples' temporal lobes in an attempt with at least some success, it must be admitted to replicate many so-called \"mystical\" experiences, out-of-body, near-death and alien abduction included. In fact, I re- boson hunter Norway's oil bomb ALIEN ABDUCTION THE INSIDE STORY ported on Persinger's work in a cover article, \"Transcending Science: The New Mysticism,\" which ap- peared in the December, 1988 issue of Omni magazine. Before that, Persinger himself had presented at the MU- FON symposium in Toronto, Canada. Persinger's research centers around the use of ma- nipulated magnetic fields to stimulate certain buried re- gions of the brain, specifically the temporal lobes, which govern our sense of self, some memory functions and other aspects of behavior. Neurons in the temporal lobes are especially sensitive to electrical stimulation. In fact, temporal lobe epilepsy, the most common form of epileptic seizure, occurs when the neurons begin firing randomly in one area and spread by a sort of conta- gious effect into others nearby. But this electrical firestorm in the brain is at the extreme end of a spectrum of sensitivity, which Persinger refers to as temporal lia- bility. An individual's response to temporal lobe stimu- lation, however, can fall far short of a physical, fall- down seizure. A ccording to Persinger. Blackmore writes, \"people with high liability have very 'unstable' temporal lobes with frequent bursts of electrical activity that can be seen on an EEC (electroencephalograph). Such peo- ple tend, he claims, to be anxious and judgmental as well as artistic. People with low liability, by contrast, rarely show bursts of activity in their temporal lobes and are much less imaginative . . . Persinger has found that people with high liability more frequently report sensa- tions of floating, flying or leaving the body as well as mystical and psychic experiences.\" JANUARY 1995 NUMBER 321 PAGE 17"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Although only a very small population of potential abductees has been tested for temporal lobe liability, they did not appear to score significantly higher than the general population. Moreover, a recent study by the late Nicholas Spanos and colleagues at Carleton University, Ottawa, found individuals reporting intense UFO experiences (both close encounters and abduc- tions) to be perfectly normal (and on the average slightly more intelligent) when compared with control subjects. A portion of their experiences, however, did appear to be associated with certain sleep parameters, which al- lows Blackmore to raise the issue of what is known as sleep paralysis. Here's how she describes it: \"During normal REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, when the majority of dreams occur, the skeletal muscles are paral- ysed . . . Normally, we are unaware of this, but occa- sionally we can become mentally alert while this paral- ysis persists. Waking up this way can be extremely un- pleasant. Yet it is quite common; surveys show that about 20 per cent of people have experienced sleep paralysis at one time or another. Trying to move and failing makes it worse and often provokes the sense that there is something trying to squash, strangle or suffocate you. Sexual arousal during dreams is common and may add a particularly powerful edge to the experience.\" Blackmore also considers the issue of the false mem- ory syndrome, but concludes that even if it is involved \"in alien abduction episodes, wouldn't there have to be some sort of core event to build the fantasies around? If so, what might this event be?\" For Blackmore, the an- swer appears to come when she straps on Persinger's ex- perimental helmet and settles into a reclining chair inside a small soundproofed room. The skull not being a par- ticularly good electrical conductor, Persinger manipu- lates magnetic fields instead, via a series of solenoids placed around the outside of the helmet. Blackmore was instructed to describe aloud anything that happened. For the first ten minutes, nothing did. \"Then,\" she says, \"suddenly my doubts vanished.\" Without warning, the chair in which she was reclining suddenly began behaving like a hammock, as if it were swaying back and forth with her in it. \"Then it felt for all the world as though two hands had grabbed my shoul- ders and were bodily yanking me upright. I knew I was still lying in the reclining chair, but someone, or some- thing, was pulling me up.\" It seemed to stretch one of her legs like taffy, drawing it halfway up the wall. \"Then came the emotions,\" says Blackmore. \"Totally out of the blue, but intensely and vividly, I suddenly felt angry not just mildly cross but that clear-minded anger out of which you act but there was nothing and no one to act on. Later, it was replaced by an equally sudden attack of fear. I was terrified of nothing in particular. The longterm medical effects of applying strong magnetic fields to the brain are largely unknown, but I felt weak and disoriented for a couple of hours after coming out of the chamber.\" B lackmore's conclusions are equally curious. \"Persinger applied a silent and invisible force to my brain and created a specific experience for me. He claimed that he was imitating the basic sequences of the process of memory and perception and that, by varying those sequences, he could control my experience. Could he have done it from a distance? Could it be done on a wider scale? Suddenly prospects of magnetic mind con- trol seem an awful lot worse than the idea of being ab- ducted by imaginary aliens.\" In response to Blackmore's article, a letter by Glenn Krawczyk of Burleigh Heads, Queensland, Australia, ap- peared in the December 17, 1994 issue of New Scientist. The letter writer notes, in part, that \"Persinger was em- ployed by the US national security establishment to de- velop behaviour-modifying electromagnetic weapons under project 'Sleeping Beauty.' He came to the atten- tion of the defence industry after he published a paper entitled 'Possible cardiac driving by an external rotating magnetic field' in 1973.\" In light of Persinger's apparent involvement in the de- velopment of so-called \"non-lethal\" weaponry, the writer suggests that \"his role in 'alien abduction' research could perhaps be assessed in a different light.\" Krawczyk concludes: \"It's high time that politicians, scientists, journalists and the public alike take a much more intense interest in assessing just where this new class of weapons is threatening to lead us and respond accordingly.\" New Scientist is almost always provocative and in- teresting reading.

Len was assigned as an Early Warning Coordinator for the Colorado Project under Dr. Edward U. Condon to screen and report all UFO activity in southwestern Ohio. Mr. Stringfield served as public relations advisor to the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) under the Director. Major Donald E. Keyhoe from 1957 to 1970. Leonard joined MUFON in 1971. as the State Section Director for southwest Ohio, and in 1974 became the Director of Public Relations, serving on the Board of Directors. Mr. Stringfield was an Associate Editor of the MUFON UFO Journal. He was also a regional investigator for the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS). Len was the author of two books: Inside Saucer Post... 3-0 Blue (Private Publication 1957) and Situation Red. The UFO Siege (New York: Doubleday 1977). He presented a copyrighted paper entitled \"Retrievals of the Third Kind: A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants in Military Custody\" at (he MUFON 1978 UFO Symposium in Dayton, Ohio, which became \"Status Report I\" in a series. In 1980, MUFON published Mr. Stnngfield's monograph and sequel to his 1978 paper entitled The UFO CraMRetrieval Syndrome, Stains Report II: New Sources. New Data.

The Mutual UFO Network is looking for a few good. men and women to conduct original, innovative research into the UFO phenomenon as a whole. The research can be of your own choosing and area of expertise, or in re- sponse to a specific MUFON research request, assuming one has the appropriate experience and qualifications necessary to the task. For MUFON professional consultants in the various scientific disciplines, this is an excellent opportunity to have your personal \"pet project\" approved and funded within the guidelines established by the primary funding sponsor. (See facing page for preliminary details, and write MUFON for a complete grant proposal form if interested.) What to study? Given a phenomenon as mysterious and multivaried as the UFO phenomenon appears to be, one shouldn't even have to ask. In our September, 1994, issue, however, we published an article by Dr. Richard F. Haines, \"Get Involved and Make a Difference!\", which listed numerous areas of potential study. You don't have to be a designated rocket scientist to qualify, either. Nor do you have to try to solve the UFO phenomenon in one fell swoop. Bits and pieces add up. Much work remains to be done, of both a historical and contemporary nature. The salient point is that funds are now available to support and promote such projects. The computer literate are always welcome, as the digital information highway continues to grow by leaps and bounds. Someone knowledgeable in this area, for ex- ample, might propose indexing each year's issues of the MUFON Journal, beginning with the current year and working backwards as time and resources permit. Or you could do it the old-fashioned way—by hand. In ei- ther case, why not send us a proposal, listing expected salary and other expenses, and perhaps have your grant approved? The most recent issue of PC Magazine has an article entitled \"Electronic Publishing with Windows Help\" by Ray Duncan. I'm no Windows Wiz personally, but it ap- pears that someone who is could very easily recast the up- coming fourth edition of the MUFON Field Investigator's Guide into a graphic, context-sensitive Windows Help program available on diskette, and do everyone a service thereby. The latter would supplement rather than sup- plant the printed version, of course, but it's still the sort of project proposal that might well be accepted, meaning that you could get paid for your time and trouble. Even though MUFON is 5000 members strong and you get the Journal mailed to your front door every month, that's no reason to assume that our work is done or that you can't actively contribute. Even if you don't want to perform the actual work yourself, please let us have your suggestions for the kind of research projects you would like to see performed.

Mars rises then at sunset in the NE and moves across the southern sky during the night. Saturn, in Aquarius, becomes increasingly hard to see in the western twilight.

In the NE the Big Dipper has returned to easy visibility, its curved handle trailing beneath the rectangular bowl. READERS' CLASSIFIEDS - Continued from Page 19 UFO DIRECTORY ISSUE #2 NOW AVAILABLE!

FIELD INVESTIGATOR'S TRAINING GUIDE To supplement the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual. T. David Spencer, with the cooperation of the Austin MUFON group, has published a new UFO Field Investigator's Training Guide. It may be best de- scribed as an introduction to methodologies, techniques, and scientific disciplines for performing UFO investi- gations in support of the Mutual UFO Network, Inc. Mr. Spencer composed this training guide when he was teaching the annual Austin MUFON Field Investigator's class as their chief investigator. This training guide is not to be confused with the forthcoming fourth edition of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual which is due to be released early in 1995, but used as a training guide for the instructors teaching field investigator's training closes. The train- ing guide is an 8 1/2\" x 11\", 304 p.i^c book assembled in a three-ring binder. It may be purchased from MU- FON in Seguin, Texas for $30 plus $3.50 for shipping and handling. This book is highly recommended for both instructors and students. RESEARCH PROPOSALS The Mutual UFO Network has joined with the Center for UFO Studies and the Fund for UFO Research in a coalition that will solicit for research proposals. The members of the coalition council will pass judgment on the proposals submitted and then fund worthy pro- jects with monetary grants. The interest of all three groups is to move the study of UFOs more toward sci- ence using the general protocols of the scientific method. Scientific research projects will receive highest priority, followed by public education projects, and then fol- lowed by general special projects. This is an opportunity for scientists, engineers, and academics to explore ideas, theories, and studies that could lead to the resolution of the UFO enigma. Proposal forms may be secured by writing to any of the three above named organizations or to Thomas P. Deuley, 103 Oldtowne Road, Seguin, TX 78155-4099. MUFON AMATEUR RADIO NET The MUFON-sponsored 40 meter net continues to meet every Saturday morning at 8 a.m. (EST or EOT) on 7.237 MHz to pass traffic concerning UFOs and re- lated phenomena. Despite current poor conditions and foreign broadcast interference heard in some parts of the country, many stations who have checked into the net regularly for years continue to do so. They are joined by numerous operators whose interest or license upgrades are more recent. Robert Schultz, WOAXK, St. Paul, MN, is now acting as primary net control operator. He is assisted by James Cormia, WB2GAJ, from Ilion, NY. David Dobbs, AA8DK, who handled the net from the Cincinnati area for many years commends them for their dedication, and continues to help as needed.
