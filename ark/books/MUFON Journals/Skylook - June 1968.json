His persistent efforts to obtain more information on UFO sighting6 than is given by the press often pays off, and through correspodence, he now has more to add to the report of the UFO Sigh- ted and filmed over bline, Ill., on Wch 9, 1967 The sighting was reported by the A.P.R.O. BULLETIN and the NATIOW EIQUIRER, amOW other news media at the time. Bill Fisher, age 32, a hllne policem~bn, did not believe in flylng saucere, but he frequently scanned the sb because he comid- ered it a part of bis duty to be able to iden- tify aircraft and he was proud of his abiAty to do so. And what he saw in the skies over 1-i ne that afternoon at 1:30 o'clock did not . mble anything he had seen before. He spotted the object when he stopped at the Sacred Heart School to speak to his con, age 12, and the two, along Kith other students and one of the Sisters (who later did not want -to discuss it) watched the brilliant object for about three minutes. Msher said the pbject had an outline sbllar to a football pnd he estimated .it to be &out 30-40 feet Tong and a mile to a mile and a half away at an altitude of around 4000 feet. (~e was later given eye testa and altitude eotFmation tests by the Alr Force which found him to be accura ate. ) The policeman watched two minutes and was so \"completely flabbergasted\" he did not think of hls 8mm movie camera that he had wlth him. Then by the time he had the camera adjusted, the object was moving awsy and disappearing ~-nd what he actually filmed was a secdnd ob- 3ect which appeared as the first one vd mov- \"fig aww. The second one hovered at 3000 feet pnen moved off to the west.

It is very unlikely they originate outside our solas syeta, he seys, because of the great distences involved and the time required to travel such diotances. The idea of speed greater than the speed of light is hard to conceive. If UFO's do originate in our solar system the most likely place is Mars, he suggests. : wpears chemically end pbysicdly possible that life could have evolved on Mars much Lt did on Earth.

Dr. Webb Garrison, ~f Evansville, Ind. thinks the first recorded report of a JFO is given in the first chapter of Ezekiel in the Bible. Ezekiel tells of seeing a strange machine from the sky land near the Xebar River in Chaldea--now Iraq. The craft was \"gleaming bronze\" like a 'wheel within a wheel,\" Ezekiel describes it md occupied by creatures fromed like men but aith four faces. \"The four wheels had rims 3nd they had spokes; and their rims were full 2f eyes round abaut * * * when the living xeatures rGse from the earth, the wheels rose Lansing, Mich."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"--.umEG= Page Six LIFE ON MARS--CONTINUED FROM PAGE 3Im These rays are thought to affect genes and ause mutations; hence the more cosmic rays triking living creatures the more mutations, nd the more rapidly the evolutionary process ould take place. The laws of evolution, Mr. Desjardens says, would indiqte that physical shapes would evolve under the erlvironaent on Mars much as they would here. ' It is &te onceivable that creatures similar to man may have evolved. One big difference might be the bsence of lungs in animal life on Mars. The tmosphere there contains about 5% oxygen, hereas ours contains about 215. However, animal life on Mms might obtain oxygen through a digestive process from chemicals such as iron oxide in food. Or, there may be a combination animal-plant process involving chlorophyl, whereby oxygen is manufactured an consumed within the animal. The speaker does not completely agree with the official phc~to interpretation of Mriner IV photos of Mars taken in 1965. Ye thinks there maybe n deep mantle of soil on Mars. If so, much activity by living things o3ul.d take place underground.
