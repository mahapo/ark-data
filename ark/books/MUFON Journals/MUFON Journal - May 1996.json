David Spencer, Deputy Director, Investigations OBJECT DISTANCE AND SIZE Of the 585 reports before 1995 that claimed sightings of UFOs, 514 estimate the distance. The object's apparent size is given in 430, and 410 include the estimated actual size. All three estimates are given in 281 (48 percent) of the reports. In 252 (43 percent) of the reports, the three mea- sures were consistent. That is. the object sizes fell within the ranges of possibilities calculated from the estimated distances and apparent sizes. Having the three mea- sures, and their being in agreement, is a confidence in- dication for the measurements - that they were made conscientiously. The distance and size statistics reported here are based on these qualified estimates. Table 4-4. Size and Distance Counts of sightings for the 252 qualified cases having consistent measures.

There were no measures of less than one foot when the objects were at distances exceeding 500 feet. Similarly, there were no measures of sizes over 300 feet when the objects were less than 101 feet away. In 27 of the 57 distances of less than 100 feet, the objects were larger than 30 feet across (almost on top of the witness). The ranges most fre- quently reported were distances between 101 feet and one mile and sizes between 31 and 100 feet. Distance from the Witness The proportions of reported distances from the witness are illustrated in Chart 4-5. Except for star shapes, none being reported within 100 feet, the distances for the six principal shapes agree with the chart. Since an object identified as a star at a distance would probably be identified as another shape at close range, the exception seems reasonable. Altitude Table 4-5.

Elevation Angle The observed angle of elevation above the horizon helps assess the object's orientation. Percentages of the data in 15 degree increments show that over 60 percent of the sightings were at elevations below 45 degrees, with a peak of 27 percent between 15 and 30 degrees. Another 25 percent were between 75 and 90 degrees. Peculiarly, only about 7 percent of the sightings fell in each of the two intervals between 45 and 75 degrees. Once an angle of 45 degrees is exceeded, people may consider the ob- ject they are viewing to be directly overhead, leading the investigator to report a 90-degree elevation.

The sphere was the only principal shape that had size estimates across the entire range of values. 2. Boomerangs exhibited sizes larger than the other shapes, the most frequent range being between 101 and 300 feet. 3. There are no qualified cases in which either a boomerang or a triangle was estimated to be less than 11 feet across. 4. The estimates of size were predominantly between 31 and 100 feet. (It is interesting that this range in- cludes the size of most airplanes.) SURFACE AND COLORS Viewed objects either have a surface or are shaped from lights. Mostly, objects are solid and have illumination. The object's surface may be glowing or dark and may have observable features. External lights may be pulsing or steady. All combinations are allowed and have been observed. Surface Appearance Table 4-7. Surface Appearances. Proportions by shape from 586 cases having data (618 data values). Values in parentheses are counts of totals. Other values are percentages by shape. Highlighted val- ues are those exceeding 20 percent. Of the 586 reports of UFOs, there were 618 claims re- garding surface appearances. Over 50 percent of the claims said the surface was either dark, dull, or un- known. Dark surfaces were usually identified either by the outline being seen as a shadow against the brighter sky, SURFACE APPEARANCE (618) Dark (117) Dull (71i Glowing (210l Misty 115) Reflective (72) Other (10) Unknown ( 1 23 1 Total I %) SHAPES Boom- erang (30) 50 13 17 0 10 0 10 100 Disc (139) 14 14 28 3 21 2 18 100 Oval (97) 15 10 41 4 14 1 15 100 Sph ere (62) s 5 75 0 10 0 3 100 Star (66) 6 o 51 0 0 \"1 39 100 Tri angle (37) 52 8 5 5 8 0 22 100 Other (187i 22 17 23 2 10 3 23 100 by the area being visible from its own lights or ground lights, or by the surface blocking the view of stars. From Table 4-7, 60 percent of the boomerangs and triangles had dark or dull surfaces, which is twice the proportion of any other principal shape. The darker sur- face is almost a signature characteristic of these two object types. In over 45 percent of the claims, the object either glowed or was reflective. Glowing was attributed to over 40 percent of the ovals, spheres, and stars and to 28 percent of the discs. These four shapes accounted for over 75 percent of the glowing objects. Only 17 percent of the boomerangs and 5 percent of the triangles exhib- ited a glowing appearance. Twenty percent of the observed discs were identified as reflective (metallic). The disc represents 40 percent of all reflective objects. Although a reflective object with lights at night can be interpreted as a glowing object, the majority (76 percent) of reflective discs were observed during daylight (after 0600 and before 2100 hours). Nearly 40 percent of the star shapes have unknown surfaces, due to the witness not being able to distin- guish one from the point of light. Other surfaces were usually claimed as unknown when the area could not be distinguished from the background. The \"misty\" category, identified in 15 reports, re- lates to a cloudy or foggy surface. The disc and oval were identified by over half of the reports claiming this characteristic, but the triangle had a greater proportion (14 percent) of its sightings given this label than any other shape. A few cases have suggested transparent objects. In one - involving triangles - a witness could see the stars through the middle of the shapes. A report from 1995 speaks of triangles having surfaces that refracted light from the stars behind them, similar to the refraction of sunlight by heated air from a highway. Another case in- volved square or rectangular \"windows'\" that seem to be without a host. Surface Features Of the 539 identifications in which the witness believed an assessment could be made, no surface features were seen for .48 percent of the objects. In almost equal PAGE 4 NUMBER 337 MAY 1996"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL CHART 4-6. TEN MOST FREQUENT COLORS 517 Surface, 635 External Lights EXTERNAL (LIGHTS) SURFACE WHITE RED ORANGE GREEN BL-WH GRAY BLACK BLUE YELLOW PINK amounts of 9 percent of the total, the objects were seen to have appendages, a dome, and/or windows. A non smooth, or patterned surface was detected 5 percent of the time. Insignias were evident on three occasions. One of these, on a disc, was described as \"black arms across the chest.\" Another identified brown squares with silver stripes on an oval object, and the third (also on an oval) identified a lightning bolt figure across the side. Most features identified as \"Other\" related to con- figurations of lights on the object. In one case, the whole object appeared to the witness like a \"gray\" type alien head, and it included the eyes. Two other reports claimed objects having almond eye features, one having dark and the other glowing eyes. Colors From Chart 4-6, the two colors representing over half of the observed surfaces are white and gray. As discussed earlier, the disc, oval, sphere, and star accounted for the majority of glowing surfaces. Since glowing ob- jects are typically white, the shapes also account for the majority (69 percent) of white surfaces. Gray surfaces are mostly metallic silver and are mostly reflective. Because of this, it should not be sur- prising that discs account for 39 percent of the gray surfaces, since 40 percent of the reflective surfaces were attributed to discs. Red, orange, and black surfaces are about equally represented at close to 10 percent each. The two princi- pal colors for external lights are white and red. Blue and green are each seen about 10 percent of the time. Atmospheric conditions can cause dispersion of light, such as from a star. The result appears to be three lights, which could confuse the witness into claiming an object composed of the primary colors. Data analysis shows that combinations of red, blue, and green were reported only 22 times, fewer than 3 percent of the reports. It is therefore concluded that reports, if any, of dispersed lights have insignificant consequence. External Light Characteristics The sighted object may have lighting effects which are solid (unwavering), flashing randomly or sequentially, pulsing or oscillating in intensity, brightening, or vary- ing in some other fashion. The object may have no de- tectable lights, or the witness may be uncertain. The percentages for each of these possibilities are given in Chart 4-7, which summarizes results from the 348 re- ports containing the data and involving only one type of object (of 353 reports for both single and multiple ob- jects). MAY 1996 NUMBER 337 PAGES"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Half of the lights were seen as unwavering, and this was true for all the principal shapes. Flashing and puls- ing lights (SEQ, RANDOM, and PULSE) are responsi- ble for about 22 percent of this set of data. Since both unwavering and flashing lights are re- quired on aircraft, more analysis was performed to roughly estimate the impact to the database of misin- terpreted aircraft. It was assumed that, if of an aircraft, the object was more than one mile away and had any combination of an unwavering, a flashing, and a pulsing light. There were 41 cases meeting these conditions, which is 11 percent of this set of data and 7 percent of all reports. It is concluded that aircraft misinterpretations due to lights probably occur, but the quantity does not significantly influence the database. EMISSIONS AND SOUNDS For 80 percent of the cases, no emissions were observed or sounds detected from the objects, but many of the re- maining 20 percent give an indication that the objects are real and may have a purpose. Such effects help establish that the objects are more than apparitions moving through the sky, and that they must have intelligence and machinery to direct their seemingly deliberate tasks. Emissions There were 119 cases in which something other than sound was emitted from the object. The only emissions of significant quantity were beams of light, observed in 43 cases and from all of the principal shapes. The disc and oval shapes were seen to issue light beams about 10 percent of the time, which was more than any other shape. Second to beams of light, trails - including vapor trails, steaks of light and other forms of wakes - were ob- served 14 times. Six of these were associated with oval shaped objects. In 12 cases, smaller objects - usually points of light - were ejected, apparently to perform some task. An aura was seen around an object nine times, five of which were associated with principal shapes (disc, oval, and tri- angle). In seven cases, flames were seen coming from the object. On six occasions, clouds or fog appeared to be emitted. Four different reports were of sparks or lightning-like flashes. In a case from 1989, the witness watched as a dumbbell-shaped object released angel hair (some of which was gathered later). A case in 1964 involved a glowing orange sphere that seemed to be emanating a repulsion field. The force pushed nearby tools away and kept the witness away from the object. Sounds Only 121 cases, 20 percent of the reports, included an identification of sound. The lack of sound is so promi- nent that this characteristic is often used to help establish that the object could not be man made. Heard during 80 sightings were hums, buzzes, whirs, and swishes, and one or another of these sounds was at- tributed more than once to each of the principal shapes. Roaring, rumbling, or jet like sounds were heard in 18 cases, but none of these were attributed to either the boomerang or the sphere. Five cases involved a hiss like static, or a crackling fire, and five others claimed whistling noises. Other sounds were like rattling cans, clicks, and grinding. In one case, witnesses heard a \"pfft\" sound as the ob- ject ejected balls of light. In another, a witness claimed musical tones, composed of the notes A, F#, D, and B. LANDINGS There were 47 reports of object landings, 13 of which in- volved either a disc or an oval. Only one star shape and a small number of triangles and spheres were asso- ciated with landings, and no landings of boomerang shapes were reported. The approach of the object was observed in 13 re- ports. In 23 cases, the object was observed hovering. In 15, the descent of the object was observed, and in seven cases, witnesses saw the object on the ground. In 12 re- ports, witnesses either saw the object raise from the ground or watched it ascend from the area believed to be a landing spot. In two cases involving discs and one case with an oval, the grasses at the landing spot were swirled much like crop circles. One other case was of four circles found in an oat field (1993). In seven cases, the landing area appeared either dis- colored, baked (scorched), or burned, and in four, the area was either depressed or crushed. Soil and/or vegetation samples were taken after nine of the landings. In four cases, the samples were tested. Except for swirled grass not being damaged, no test re- sults were given in the reports. Other than the angel hair mentioned earlier (Emissions), no artifacts were identified. FOLLOWING THE WITNESS It was common for witnesses to chase after UFOs, but there were only a few cases in the database in which UFOs chased witnesses. Such activity reinforces the notion that UFOs have intelligent pilots who are not immune to curiosity and gamesmanship. Some cases are almost incidental, as in the following: • A white sphere followed three girls at 45 miles per hour, then went on by when they turned a corner. (Log #881004) • Two women were driving in a wooded area when a PAGE 6 NUMBER 337 MAY 1996"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL CHART 4-7.

It then made a crackling sound and van- ished. (Log # 900302) • While driving, the witness saw a disc shaped object hovering over the right side of the road. After stop- ping and watching it for two minutes, the witness drove on. He soon found that the object was follow- ing at his speed of 30 - 40 miles per hour. At a corner, the object hovered a few seconds, then left. (Log # 901109) Some cases give a suggestion of a threat, adding to the witness' fear, as follows: • Two lights followed the witnesses at the side of the car, keeping with them as they tried to get away but leaving when they reached their destination. (Log # 881101) • A woman driving home with her child saw a white oval object in the trees, and it was following them. She stopped the car near her house, and the object hovered above them, its light reflecting off the road and the grass. Before long, her husband drove up, and the object \"shot up and vanished.\" (Log # 890616) • A woman and her child en route home saw a group of oval lights following them. When they arrived, the objects first hovered 2-10 feet above the mobile home then split into two groups and left. (Log # 931242J) Two cases highlight the imperfect efforts of the UFOs to keep up with the witnesses: • An object followed a man from outside town to his home on a farm. The object missed a turn, swerved back, and continued following. It hovered over the farm for about an hour. (Log # 880410) • While driving homeward, two women saw an oval object which was hovering over a street lamp. The object began following first behind then directly above them. The object overshot a corner but re- turned. When they arrived home, the object receded slowly, then vanished.

Surfaces and Colors • Boomerangs and triangles typically had dark or dull surfaces (60 percent). • Over 40 percent of the ovals, spheres, and stars glowed. • Twenty percent of the discs had reflective properties, and 40 percent of the metallic surfaced objects were discs. — Slightly more than half of the sightings indicated features on the observed objects. — Appendages, domes, or windows were seen in 27 percent of the sightings. — Over half of the surface colors were either white or gray, and over half of the external lights were either white or red. — Light dispersion resulting in false reports has not been significant. • In 353 cases, external lights were observed, and 348 regarded lights on single objects displaying a total of 374 effects. — Solid, unwavering lights (189) accounted for 51 percent of the effects. — There were 106 identifications of flashing or puls- ing lights, amounting to 28 percent of the effects. — An estimate was made that up to 41, or 7 percent, of all reports could have been misinterpreted aircraft, but the quantity is not enough to significantly impact the database. Emissions and Sounds • Emissions were observed in 20 percent (119) of the cases. — Emissions of light beams were reported 43 times. — Vapor trails, or similar, were reported 14 times. — Twelve reports claimed smaller objects being ejected by a host. — Other emissions reported more than once were auras, flames, fog, and sparks. — One witness watched the expulsion of angel hair. • Sound was detected in 20 percent (121) of the reports. — Hum, buzz, swish, and whir were sounds claimed by 80 reports. — Roars, rumbles, and jet like sounds were men- tioned in 18 reports. — Whistling noises, hissing, static, or the sound of a fire wereYeported 10 times. Landings • There were 47 reports of landings, and 13 of them were either discs or ovals. • Hovering was seen in 23 cases, the descent in 15 and the take off in 12 cases. • Only seven cases reported seeing the object on the ground. • Four cases involved swirled grass or crop circles, and 11 indicated the landing area was either discol- ored, baked (scorched), burned, depressed, or crushed. Following the Witness • In nine cases, one or more objects were observed following the witness' car for a significant distance. • In two cases, the object overshot the car at a corner and had to return to continue the chase. PREVIEW OF SECTION 5 In part, the next section of this report discusses addi- tional evidence obtained and examines reported effects to electronic and electromagnetic devices and to animals when and after sightings occur. Additionally, multiple events during the same day and sequential days are ex- amined for corroborations. For some inexplicable reason, your humble editors type- set Part 2 of Mr. Spencer's Section 4 (\"Viewed Objects\") analysis of MUFON'S computerized UFO data before we did Part 1. This is embarrassing, of course, but ob- viously doesn 't affect the outcome of the analysis one way or the other. We 'II try to get back on course next is- sue, and then follow with Section 5. continuing in order. Our apologies for any inconvenience to the author and our readers. Upon completion of the series, we'll include a publication guide for future reference, listing the issue in which each section was originally published. Again our profound apologies.

March 24, a man who wishes to remain anonymous walked into Roswell's UFO Museum with a piece of metal allegedly recovered from the 1947 crash of a UFO. The donor was described only as a local citizen. One of the museum's administrators, Secretary/Treasurer Max Littell. was quoted in the AP article: \"From the information we have,\" he said, \"this is from a man who was stationed here and was part of the crew that helped pick it up. We are not saying one way or another that this is what it is, but we are going to do everything we can to find out.\" Pictures of the framed specimen were soon circulat- ing on the WWW. The above original photographs were made by Miller Johnson during the analysis phase. The darker areas are copper, while the white portions are silver. The specimen has now been analyzed by X-ray flu- orescence at the New Mexico Bureau of Mines and Mineral Resources in Socorro, and appears to be com- posed of a thin sliver of silver coated with copper on one side. Miller Johnson's report on the object, which first appeared in the NM MUFON Newsletter, updated and accompanied by additional photographs, will appear in the next issue of the Journal.

Hackney I t is said that what is actually heated to incandes- cence when a shooting star scores a path across some small portion of the night sky is a piece of space debris no larger than a grain of sand. The casual observer of these brief but stunning events, however, would think that something rather more substantial was afoot. Although these diminutive cosmic visitors can be seen on almost any dark, clear night, the same cannot be said of their larger counterpart, the fireball. Fireballs do not wink in and out of sight after a second or two of splendent flight. Looking somewhat like an airplane on fire, fireballs eat up the sky like nobody's business. Very few people have ever, or will ever, see a true cos- mic fireball in their lifetime. The number of those who have, however, must have surely increased by some significant factor on the evening of October 9, 1992, when a ''lime-green\" fireball — \"brighter than a full moon\" — was seen from North Carolina and West Virginia to New York and Ohio. Because of the early evening hour, the IFO was cap- tured on videotape by no fewer than fourteen amateur video recordists in four different states. During the sec- ond half of its luminous 450-mile, 40-second run, the fireball was seen to fragment into more than 70 clearly defined pieces. One of these was recovered forty miles north of New York City after it smashed through the back end of a parked Chevrolet. It weighed 27.3 pounds (12.4kg). The meteorite crash-landed at 7:50 p.m. while Michelle Knapp of Peekskill was inside her house watching television. Upon investigating what sounded like a car crash outside, she discovered to her initial chagrin a smoking and charred rock embedded in a shallow crater under her Chevrolet, which had a large hole where it's right-rear signal-light used to be. To make things worse, she had no meteorite insurance on her car (alas). Over the next several days, more than 400 people showed up in her front yard to gawk at the basketball- sized hole the meteor had created, or to get a glimpse of the football-shaped meteorite that had caused it. Several different local and New York City television news trucks also pulled up in her driveway. As it happened, Michelle Knapp could not have re- ceived a better 18th birthday present (October 12). Eventually, she was able to sell to two collectors both the damaged car and the meteorite for a total of about $75,000. According to Martin Prinz, the American Museum of Natural History curator who bid unsuccess- fully for the meteorite, the rock from space must have sold for upwards of $50,000, while the punctured car sold for about $25.000. The meteorite's winning buyer, a dealer in such artifacts, later sold the 27.3-pound chondrite by the gram to a hungry meteorite market, pocketing a considerable profit in the process. The meteorite was taken first to the Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory in Palisades, N.Y. There it was classified as an H6 Chondrite, making it among the more common meteorites found. Most of the rock's four-billion year old geological history had been melted or fused long ago, making it relatively uninteresting to geologists. (Not so to one team of astronomers, though.) According to William Menke of the above-mentioned observatory, \"It's likely the 30-pound brown and grey rock came from the annual Draconid meteor shower, which was visible the length of the east coast on Friday night. It may turn out that scientifically this is a real breakthrough or an interesting thing that gets written about on a list with 4,999 other meteorites.\" It seems Dr. Menke was at least right about one thing. The video recordings made that night provided a wealth of time-resolved dynamical detail never before recorded for an event of this nature. These were the first motion pictures of a fireball from which a meteorite has ever been recovered. From the large amount of data this made available, physicists were able by the following year to reconstruct for only the fourth time in history both the original orbit in space and exact groundpath of a meteor after its fall. It was, in a word, the most fully documented and conspicuous fireball event of modern times. Although the fireball sighting occurred during the Draconid meteor shower (October 8 through 10), it turned out not be a Draconid at all. The fireball that hit a car had come from a different direction in the sky than that of the constellation, Draco the Dragon, from whence the Draconids are named. The Peekskill fireball was a sporadic, whose true source was the solar sys- tem's asteroid belt. This is confirmed by the apparent ra- diant of the fireball, or the point on the celestial sphere from which the meteor appeared to originate, which was: a = 15 h 07 min ± 02 min. c, = -16.2° ± 0.2° (epoch 2000.0). T he first video record, shot when the fireball was at a height of 46 km, shows an angle of incidence of only 3.4°, which is unusually low. This means the meteor nearly bounced off the atmosphere and headed back into space. This is reminiscent of a fireball that did skip off the atmosphere in August, 1972, though not before being sighted from Salt Lake City to Calgary, Canada, a PAGE 10 NUMBER 337 MAY 1996"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Cnr inl by Peckskill meteorite. distance of almost 1000 miles. If this larger meteor had crashed to earth, scientists believe it would have ex- ploded with a force equal to several Hiroshima-sized bombs. Another interesting characteristic revealed in the video record was that just before it fragmented, it flick- ered at a frequency of 6 Hz. Of the thousands of phone calls received by authorities that night, many referred to its strong green hue. This color does not appear in the video recordings because the fireball's brightness satu- rated the dynamic response of the camcorders' CCD (charge-coupled device) photodetectors. The fireball's groundpath was determined by trian- gulation analysis, which was made possible by a frame- by-frame analysis of four of the fourteen recordings studied. These included the ones made from Fairfax. Virginia (38° 51' N. 77° 19' W): Johnstown, Pennsylvania (40° 20' N, 78° 56' W); Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (40 C 26' N. 80\" 01' W): and Willoughby. Ohio (41° 38'N. 81° 26'W). A frame rate of 30 frames per second (60 video fields per second) was assumed by the analyzing team, which consisted of four Canadians, one Czech, and one American (oddly enough). Their analysis revealed a preatmospheric velocity for the fireball of more than 15 km per second. According to their report to the British journal Nature, \"The duration of the event (10-20 times longer than typical fireballs), the use of data from four More radiowaves in space were scanned and analyzed for intelligent origins during the first few minutes of this $100 million, \"all-sky,\" alien-hunting project than were perused in all the previous fifty SETI pro- jects combined. widely spaced stations, the large number of points (254), and the excellent (1/60 s) time resolution all contributed to a rather precise preatmospheric velocity and apparent radiant.\" During the last stage of its recorded flight, the fireball was seen to have slowed to about 5 km per sec- ond. Just for the record, the Peekskill fireball might also rank among the more \"auspicious\" cosmic events in recent memory. The \"cosmic fender-bender\" occurred just three days before the well noted occasion of the 500th anniversary of Columbus' discovery of America (October 12, 1992). Coincidentally (perhaps), the event also occurred three days before NASA/Ames activated the High Resolution Microwave Survey, the first large- scale SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) project ever undertaken by Man.

As a former journalist and journalism professor, I have often winced with em- barrassment at the antics of broadcast anchormen who somehow feel obliged to end every UFO story with a snide comment or a dumb joke. It is as if by doing so, they can distance themselves from the subject matter and demonstrate to the audience how objective, credible and professional they are. Such comments and raised eyebrows, I have noticed, do not explain to the viewers why the TV station chose in the first place to air the story. They are left to wonder why, if the story was so ridiculous, they bothered to cover it at all. The reason, of course, is the ratings. TV stations and newspapers are, first and foremost, businesses, and it is this fact that accounts for much of their content. Editors and news directors are well aware of the public's seem- ingly unquenchable thirst for UFO information, and even if they themselves are ignorant of the subject, they understand one thing quite well: UFOs sell newspapers and boost ratings. MUFON members, who from time to time may find themselves dealing with the press, must be constantly aware of this truth, for it can either be the cause of great consternation or it can provide much- needed publicity opportunities. Three cases of media contact during the last year serve to illustrate the problem. Not long ago, the State Section Director in El Paso, Tex., Dr. Roberta Fennig, was contacted by a television reporter who was anxious to get an interview for a story. \"We're doing a three-part series on UFOs and I need to see you right away,\" he said. He was working on a short deadline and asked for a meeting that same day. Dr. Fennig contacted me and we agreed to meet with the reporter on the condition that the meeting be \"off the record.\" Since we did not know the reporter, we felt a need to act cautiously. We needed to know what the program would cover and how it would be approached. To determine this, we asked a few questions: \"Why are you interested in doing a series on UFOs?\" we asked.\"My news director assigned me the story,\" he responded. \"Is your news director interested in UFOs?\" \"I don't think so.\" \"Then why do the story? Has something happened to stir up interest in the subject?\" we queried. \"I don't think so.\" \"Well, why do a series at this time,\" we probed. \"It has to do with the ratings,\" he confessed. \"Next week is sweeps week.\" (The week in which audience sizes are measured to determine how much a station can charge for advertising is called \"sweeps week.\") \"Ok, what do you know about UFOs?\" \"Not much,\" he replied honestly. \"Have you read any books on the subject?\" \"No.\" \"Are you aware that your network (CBS) devoted an hour of serious discussion to the subject on the '48 Hours' program?\" we inquired. \"Uh, no, I didn't see that.\" \"How much air time will your station devote to this three-part series?\" \"Each segment is going to be about 2 to 3 minutes.\" I t quickly became obvious that 1) the reporter was to- tally ignorant of the subject; 2) neither he nor anyone at his station had any serious interest in the subject; 3) the only purpose of the report was to hype the nightly news to gain higher ratings; and 4) that the station was going to rush to throw together something without much research or concern for the seriousness of the subject. In the end, we opted not to participate, although we realized we were passing up an opportunity to bring in new members and to publicize our hotline number. We had good reason to be concerned that any comments we might make could be taken out of context for the pur- pose of providing the station with a 20-second \"sound byte\" to be used to hype their evening news show. Dr. Fennig, whose experience at dealing with the media is limited, was amazed by the lack of profes- sionalism demonstrated by the reporter. \"I thought he would have at least done a little research on the subject before asking for an interview,\" she commented. This ex- ample should serve as a lesson for MUFON spokesper- sons who will find that the job of educating reporters is never ending. They cannot assume that journalists know anything about the volumes of evidence pertaining to the reality of UFOs or that they have even heard the names of persons like Dr. John Mack, Budd Hopkins, Dr. J. Allen Hynek or other well-known researchers. Walt Andrus. International Director of MUFON, re- cently received a call from a reporter from a newspaper in Pensacola, Florida who wanted an interview and in- formation on the Gulf Breeze case. \"He knew absolutely nothing about the events of Gulf Breeze,\" says Walt, \"even though Pensacola is just a few miles across the PAGE 12 NUMBER 337 MAY 1996"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Remember that anything you say to a re- porter is quotable unless you received a pledge of anonymity before you made the statement.

He didn't even know who Ed Walters was. I asked him how long he had worked in Pensacola and he said five years. I told him the Gulf Breeze case was at least eight years old.\" On another occasion, a reporter for the El Paso Herald Post approached me for help in arranging an in- terview with an abductee. She wanted to do a feature story to accompany the story she was doing on John Carpenter's lecture on the abduction phenomenon at the University of Texas at El Paso. In the past, she had done an excellent job on a front page story concerning a lecture by speaker Robert Dean. She had even called him long distance for an interview. Since I had confi- dence in her, I assisted her in setting up an interview with a local woman who had a lifetime of UFO experi- ences. The interview resulted in a large, front page arti- cle which was no doubt responsible for the large crowd that attended Carpenter's presentation. It was a fair, in- depth and serious effort to convey the terror, trauma and honest confusion experienced by an otherwise in- telligent, well-adjusted and productive individual. The difference between these two cases of media contact serves as a good lesson for MUFON members who may not have experience in dealing with the press. Here are a few suggestions about how to handle the media and to get better publicity: 1) Members should be taught to handle unsolicited media contact properly. One person in the chapter, preferably the State Section Director or another experi- enced individual, should be designated as the spokesper- son. All requests for information or interviews should be directed to him or her. 2) The spokesperson should seek out reporters who are interested in and knowledgeable about the subject and work with them by being their sources of informa- tion. Cultivate relationships with those who can be trusted to do a fair job. 3) Media contact is optional and should be on your own terms. You are not obligated to speak to a reporter and you should not do so if you are uncomfortable with the format or with the individual. Be prepared to be badgered for a statement. Reporters know that if they can keep you on the phone or engaged in conversation for more than a minute or so, chances are you will end up \"spilling your guts.\" Learn to say \"no comment,\" or \"I can't be a source for you on this story,\" then hang up! Remember that anything you say to a reporter is quotable unless you received a pledge of anonymity before you made the statement. For that reason, many re- porters will attempt to strike up a casual conversation, without telling you that you are being interviewed. As disagreeable as it may seem, it is in your best interest to consider every newsperson as an adversary, for he is ca- pable of making you look extremely foolish. 4) Before saying anything quotable, first find out what the nature of the story is and what the reporter's views are. Ask for a face to face, off the record meeting to get acquainted. Make it clear what comments are \"off the record\" and which are for attribution. Tape record the interview as a safeguard. 5) Do not assume the reporter knows anything about the subject or has done any research. Find out what books he has read and who else he is going to interview. Do not assume that the reporter will be objective, fair or sympathetic. Remember, reporters use people to get a story that will sell newspapers or get ratings. Their own interests come first, not telling the truth. 6) When dealing with TV stations, find out how much air time they plan to devote to the story. Realize that even though they interview you for 20 minutes, they may only use a 10- or 20-second film clip of the most sensational statements you make. It will be to- tally out of context and could make you look foolish. 7) Learn to exercise caution with your choice of words and think carefully before you say anything on the air or for attribution. Always opt for the most conserv- ative choice of words and qualify your statements. For example, investigators should use the term \"UFO\" or \"object\" rather than \"spaceship.\" Remember, you can't prove it was a spaceship. Use the words, \"apparent\" or \"potential\" when describing an abduction or alien en- counter. Be cautious about stating as fact those things that cannot be proven, such as \"the government is test- ing flying saucers,\" or \"aliens are from Zeta Reticuli\" or \"alien bodies were recovered at Roswell.\" 8) If your meetings are open to the public, it is a good idea to ask if there are any reporters or media representatives in the audience. If so, you may wish to ask for a promise that the meeting be \"off the record\" or you may wish to ask the person to leave. Having a re- porter present at a meeting may seriously interfere with a free and open discussion of important issues. Members should not have to worry about being quoted in the newspaper for statements made at meetings.

Lifeless victims — 69 in all — lay strewn across the yards of two fami- lies in Sweetwater, a heavily Hispanic neighborhood in south Miami. But it was a Miami massacre with a dif- ference — a case perhaps for Ace Ventura, Pet Detective. The victims were all animals — goats, chickens, geese and ducks. Who — or what — could have done such a das- tardly thing? The killer, say police and a local zoologist, was a large dog. Wrong, say local residents. It was the chupacabras, the Caribbean's very own Bigfoot, except this creature is a vampire-like predator whose name literally means \"Goatsucker\" in Spanish. Don't be surprised if you haven't heard of the chu- pacabras. Until this month it had never been seen or heard of outside Puerto Rico, the U.S. island common- wealth of four million people. For the past six months, the hideous bloodsucking beast with an oval-head and bulging red-eyes — part reptile, part insect, part UFO alien — allegedly has been terrorizing the island's cen- tral mountains. But after the slaughter in Sweetwater, the chupacabras has firmly established a place in the annals of Miami make-believe. It may sound like something out of Star Trek, but it has gripped more than just the imagination of Hispanic Miami. For those who believe in the chupacabras, the fear is real. In some cases the attack on livestock has caused serious economic loss. One Sweetwater woman claims to have seen it, and there have been alleged chupacabras attacks in other parts of Miami. The beast has developed a large fol- lowing in Latino communities across the United States, from New Jersey to California. Authorities are taking the killings seriously — up to a point. A specialist has investigated the deaths, and a county commissioner has called for a police inquest. \"It's mushroomed way out of proportion,\" says Ron Magill, assistant curator at metroDade zoo. \"I'm sit- ting here literally in shock.\" Chupacabras has aroused great interest, and discus- sion — some of it less than serious — on the Internet, where it has its own home page, complete with sketches created by a Princeton University history student. (http://www.princeton.edu/~accion/chupa.html) \"This has turned out to be a new kind of folklore,\" said the student, Hector Armstrong, a native of Puerto Drawing courtesy of Cesar Remus MUFON State Director for Puerto Rico. Rico. There is even talk of a video-game spin-off, he says. It already has become big business: There are T- shirts, a chupacabras sandwich, live morning radio and a Spanish pop song with a chorus that roughly translated goes like this: \"Gotta have fun and party. In case the Goatsucker gonna get me.\" Last week English-language radio got in on the act when the popular station Y-100 ran a week-long \"search of the elusive chupacabras!\" offering a $1,000 prize for a real photo of the creature. The station made its own mock effort, sending a reporter into the Sweetwater woods dressed in a goat costume. The chupacabras coverage was a hit. One of Latin America's most watched Spanish-lan- guage TV chat shows, Cristina, which is recorded in Miami where it has a large audience, gave credence to the \"chupacabras phenomenon\" with an hour-long pro- gram on it Monday. On the show was Jose \"Chemo\" Soto, the mayor of Canovanas, a town in Puerto Rico where the chu- pacabras supposedly has claimed more than 100 victims. Soto, who is running for re-election, offered viewers this grim warning: \"Whatever it is, it's highly intelligent. Today it is attacking animals, but tomorrow it may attack people.\" A former police detective, Soto is known to locals as \"Chemo (Indiana) Jones,\" for his quest to capture the mysterious creature. Using caged goats as bait, Soto PAGE 14 NUMBER 337 MAY 1996"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL leads a weekly monster hunt of local volunteers who pa- trol the town's surrounding hills — so far to no avail. A lso interviewed on Cristina: a vet from Puerto Rico — nicknamed Dr. Chupacabras — who claims the wounds he has examined on alleged victims of the beast are \"totally abnormal\" fang-like punctures. Others on the program included an extraterrestrial philosopher and a writer on UFOs, who believe the chupacabras was sent from another planet to Puerto Rico. According to Jorge Martin, publisher of Evidencia, a magazine on UFO research, aliens are drawn to Puerto Rico by the Arecibo Observatory, the world's largest ra- dio telescope. The killings, whatever their cause, are a serious prob- lem that has frightened many people in Puerto Rico and Miami. This has been fueled by a number of eyewitness ac- counts from seemingly credible people. At least 15 Canovanas residents claim to have had a close encounter with the monster. \"I was looking off the balcony one night, and I saw it step out of a bright light in the back yard,\" said Michael Negron, a 25-year-old college student. \"It was about 3 or 4 feet tall with skin like that of a dinosaur. It had bright red eyes the size of hens' eggs, long fangs and multi-colored spikes down its head and back.\" The creature reportedly disembowelled the fam- ily goat, draining the blood from its neck. Some theories — and eyewitness accounts — are harder to believe than others. Consider the latest sighting in the Puerto Rican town of Caguas, where the chu- pacabras allegedly entered a bedroom window and mauled a stuffed teddy bear, leaving a \"puddle of slime.\" Critics say the hysteria has been whipped up by sen- sationalist media that are eager to promote the legend as part of a sales or rating drive. Puerto Rico is a fertile market for such bizarre tales, due to widespread Afro- Caribbean cultural and religious beliefs that involve an- imal sacrifices and blood rituals. Officials say folk monster tales are hard to combat with rational explanations. Just ask Magill, the Miami zoologist. When he at- tended the Sweetwater slaying, he pointed out to resi- dents what he believes to be incontrovertible proof the killer was a large dog, maybe 50 pounds in weight, or more. \"They were just totally not listening,\" he said. On in- spection he found the bite marks were \"classic canine punctures from dogs.\" As for the vampire theory, \"Contrary to the popular belief, all the animals were full of blood.\" He demonstrated this on one dead goat. \"I took a knife and cut into the carotid artery and blood came out of the carcass.\" He also showed where he believes a dog dug its way under the garden fence. \"It was a classic dog digging. You could see all the dirt pushed back and dog hair on the bottom of the fence.\" Magill was able to identify footprints as being that of a dog. Residents wanted to know why none of the animals had been eaten. Again he points to what he calls the \"classic m.o.\" of dog attacks. \"Dogs don't kill for food, they kill for fun. It's a thrill.\" For Magill the scene was a deja vu experience. Two years earlier, dogs killed 15 antelopes at the zoo in the same fashion. But Magill says all his explanations were for naught. Local residents were enthralled by heavy me- dia attention that day. An older woman came out of the house and turning to a group of TV cameras demonstrated how she had con- fronted the chupacabras. \"It stood up on two legs and was hunched over like this with big arms and looked at me with these red eyes,\" the woman said. \"I just said, 'Oh jeez, here we go,'\" says a discour- aged Magill. \"As soon as she did that every news media camera zoomed in on her. That was the footage they played over and over again.\" Part Cuban, and fluent in Spanish, Magill under- stands the cultural sensitivity of older people in the Hispanic community over their religious and cultural be- liefs. He even believes in UFOs and extraterrestrial life forms. \"I'm not one of those pure scientists who say 'No. we are the only ones with the truth and all that stuff is ludicrous,' \" he says. \"It's just in this case that was not it.\" Copyright 1996 St. Petersburg Times.

Rachel, and the highway, lie next to a section of the huge Nellis Gunnery Range known as Area 51. Area 51 is the site of a super-secret test facility that has gained ufological fame in recent years. Many sight- ings of strange lights have taken place around the facil- ity, whose very existence was denied by Air Force offi- cials until recently.

March 1996). I would like to offer additional remarks in response to ques- tions and doubts raised by Nova's \"Kidnapped By Aliens?\" program. There were numerous opinions of- fered without supportive evidence or opportunities for debate or rebuttal. This indeed caused the program to be explanatory rather than exploratory, biased instead of balanced, and selective as opposed to openly scientific. Science has become a type of religion with its own rules, accepted beliefs, and dislike for anything chal- lenging to either. Like an exclusive country club, it snubs those who either do not belong or appear to un- dermine the expertise of those who already \"belong.\" There are scientists who are secretly looking at UFO data but fearful of anyone knowing so. Science does not seem to learn from its own history in which the ac- cepted beliefs have been forced to change from over- whelming evidence that accumulates over time by those who stay open to the scientific process. (Note how many times in the past few years the age of the universe has been altered and updated due to new revelations from the Hubble telescope!) The first question should be: \"Who should be al- lowed as experts and spokesmen for the study of UFO Abductions?\" The obvious answer would be those who are involved in the research as well as those from related fields of science who have examined evidence pre- sented to them. This immediately excludes both Carl Sagan — who we know has refused to participate in UFO investigations when invited — and physicist Paul Horowitz, who claimed that there is \"no evidence what- soever\" for the existence or visitation of UFOs to this planet. Neither Sagan nor Horowitz present any sup- portive evidence for their opinions. Although Dr. John Mack possesses all the credentials, psychiatric experi- ence, and research involvement needed to make his statements, it is Carl Sagan's claim that prevails as to the psychology of this mystery simply being \"mass hallu- cinations.\" I am no more of an astronomer than Carl Sagan is a psychiatric professional, but does this now give me the right to present my theories of the Cosmos as a more informed viewpoint than Sagan's? Sagan pre- sents safe, palatable opinions based on accepted, logical thinking — but fails completely to cite a single case, sci- entific inquiry, or supporting piece of evidence to sub- stantiate his opinions. Carl Sagan's term \"mass hallucination\" is a curious construction in itself. A hallucination is a private, inter- nal disturbance of one's mind, individualized and char- acterized by all the dynamics and personal history of that particular individual. The components and nature of the psychotic distortion are also specific to that individual. We can have ten \"Jesus Christs\" in a psychiatric unit — but no two are exactly alike nor do they typically agree with each other's perspective! Therefore, millions of hallucinating persons would produce diverse, individu- alized scenarios, utilizing popular aspects of science fiction, and mixed with their own imagination. What are the odds that these fantasies would fall into neat little patterns of intricate detail, sequence, and with similar bizarreness or confusion for millions of people? What about the cases of multiple participant abductions in which witnesses independently recall the same event in much detail, matching their observations of each other, the order of events, and the same bizarre but con- fusing aspects of their shared event? W hy is it that hypnotherapists and researchers are finding that efforts to lead abductees or suggest answers to them —that do not fit with research — all fail consistently from case to case? In other words, the na- ture of the reality that abductees are either recalling or creating is apparently existent prior to any hypnosis sessions. If this is just a product of hypnosis as Professor Robert Baker suggests, then how can the fantasized ac- counts match so neatly with documented conscious en- counters that are unknown to these hypnosis subjects? How could a family's careful and fully conscious de- scription of little gray men with oversized heads and big black slanting eyes, walking around a landed disk in a park, perfectly match the subconscious fantasies of hyp- notic subjects? Can a hallucination crash in the desert of New Mexico and be retrieved secretly by the military? Can a hallucination be tracked on radar and/or leave an oval of highly-affected, dehydrated soil behind? Why do the best conscious descriptions of alien bodies retrieved and autopsied (from numerous independent sources) all match the exact details of hypnotically-retrieved de- tails from \"fantasizing\" subjects? If alien memories are allegedly implanted by careless hypnotists, then wouldn't these created scenarios reflect the beliefs and opinions of each hypnotist? The reports from many pro- fessionals with varying backgrounds from around the country are that the accounts reflect a consistent scenario with an emotional and detailed core of reality unrelated to any obvious belief system of a particular hypnother- apist. (Despite acquiring similar data, some researchers do tend to favor certain aspects or themes in their reports to others, thus making it appear that they only have cer- tain kinds of cases.) Professor Baker also states that exposing a person to hypnosis merely \"turns on their imagination,\" suggest- ing that hypnotic recall would rarely have any reliable value. But a research study of over 500 cases of trau- PAGE 16 NUMBER 337 MAY 1996"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Persinger's research into temporal lobe phenomena is admirable but hardly enough to explain the involved and matching pat- terns of countless abduction details. The vague sensations and feelings described are hardly enough to fully explain, for ex- ample, a farmer's three-hour, detailed, and very emotional experiences which match in precise detail to the accounts of so many others unknown to him. matic/violent crimes investigated by the Los Angeles po- lice department analyzed the use of hypnosis and its reliability in investigating such emotional cases. In at least half of these cases in which the information re- trieved through hypnosis could be verified, hypnotic recall had a accuracy rating of 90% — which was greater than the accuracy rating of consciously-recalled details in those cases! Sending someone off into a past- life journey as Dr. Baker did for this Nova special does of course demonstrate suggestibility and probable fan- tasizing. The past-life subject reports familiar themes, common characters, and known aspects of human his- tory. However, abductees are instead confused by what they see in terms of strange beings, odd places, un- known procedures, and inexplicable physics — like passing through walls. Past-life regressions will always be unique, diverse, individualized and personal; they will never fit into researchable patterns like abduction accounts unless Dr. Baker's next 100 subjects all report the exact same interesting journey back through time! N ova's emphasis on Dr. Mack's one subject who de- liberately lied and played the role of an abductee like an actress studying a part seems quite unfair. It is not uncommon in Psychiatry for even the best of profes- sionals to be taken in by a clever liar or sociopath. The point here is that her performance is unique and not typical of the kinds of respectable persons involved nor their reasons for seeking truth and understanding. Persinger's research into temporal lobe phenomena is admirable but hardly enough to explain the involved and matching patterns of countless abduction details. The vague sensations and feelings described in Persinger's research are hardly enough to fully explain, for example, a farmer's three-hour, detailed, and very emotional experiences which match in precise detail to the accounts of so many others unknown to him. How could the four men in the canoe of the Allagash incident all experience simultaneous temporal lobe reactions and report such bizarre but matching details? How could three fully-awake adults in a car, watching with great ex- citement and fear as a UFO descends, be experiencing the hypnogogic effects of sleep paralysis as Dr. Baker suggests? Dr. Baker says that these people \"should be told thai it is a dream\" because nobody has ever been helped by believing it is true. It would take a whole ar- ticle to list the numerous ways people have felt helped, made changes for the better, and felt forever indebted to our efforts because of their growth and personal success after clarifying and better understanding their lives. Nova failed terribly in not presenting all the kinds of information that it could have. Nova failed in not pre- senting a balanced debate from those actually doing the research. Nova simply failed as a science program. Perhaps it is merely a reflection of how our present process in science has been failing. For Nova staffer Liesl Clark to state that showing corroborating physical evidence would be \"opening a can of worms\" is remi- niscent of the reactions that scientists had to viewing Gallileo's telescope: To look through it might introduce challenges to accepted science; therefore, don't look! May we all grow bolder to openly look where others still fear to even take a measured glance. Carpenter's E-mail address is Starman|C@aol.com. NET NEWS - Continued from Puge /5 At the ceremonies. Miller is to announce the first step in a promotional plan for the highway and rural Nevada. Robert Harper, the President of Marketing for Twentieth Century Fox Films, will be a guest at the ceremonies, along with cast members from Fox's new film, Independence Day. which opens on July 3. The film, which details an alien invasion of Earth, involves the base at Area 51. A special \"extraterrestrial theme\" sign for the highway will be unveiled at the ceremonies, along with a monument to commemorate the dedication and the premier of the film. A special panel discussion with notable ufologists will be featured, composed of Walter Andrus, George Knapp, Vicki and Don Ecker. The event will begin on April 17, with a reception put on by Fox at Planet Hollywood at Caesar's in Las Vegas. The next morning, a convoy will depart for Rachel for the 2:00 PM dedication.

Travis Walton has written a remarkable book. Fire in the Sky (Marlowe & Co.. 1996). It is remarkable because the author, its central character, presents the case with such incisive journalistic excellence that it's easy to forget this is basically his true story of an event of tran- scendent consequence to the human species. The book invokes Mark Twain's dictum, that faith is a wonderful thing, but it's doubt that'll get you an education. Walton achieves a comprehensive fleshing out (missing else- where) of the context in which the underlying UFO event happened. Without this fastidious attention, the incredible facts are indeed hard to digest. For critics, whose doubts have yet to harden into intractable cynical certitude, this book gives the chance to rediscover. That is Walton's stated hope, with particular emphasis drawn to reconcile the imagery of the film. \"Fire in the Sky,\" based on his first book. The Walton Experience (Berkley, 1977). with the facts as he has come to more com- pletely understand them. The context of the event is drawn thoughtfully and carefully from Walton's first hand knowledge and his own investigation. Little details are presented such as: hometown Snowflake, Ariz., is not named for the local gullibles, but two of its prominent families, the Rakes and the Snows: three academic college scholarships were of- fered Walton: the job of a logger and the personal lives of those men (Walton reflects that he used to be a risk- taker, motorcycles, fast cars, martial arts, but now. married with two children, never misses a PTA meeting or leaves the curb before everyone buckles up); a blistering, docu- mented indictment of the methods used and conclusions reached by Philip Klass and CSICOP in an 82-page ap- pendix: a virtual treatise on proper and improper poly- graph testing (Walton clearly establishes the statistical near certainty corroborating witness testimony), etc. For those few unfamiliar with the central UFO event, the book tells that on the evening of November 5, 1975, a group of loggers were in a pick-up truck in the White Mountains of N.E. Arizona when they observed a strange light in the sky. One of the men. Walton, was cu- rious, and despite warnings from the others, left the ap- parent safety of the truck for a closer look. Suddenly, standing nearly beneath the soundlessly hovering craft, he was violently blasted backward 10 feet through the air. His companions tied in fear and reported Walton's disappearance as an encounter with a UFO. For five days, the men were suspected of homicide until Walton reappeared, recalling being taken aboard an alien craft. PAGE 18    NUMBER 337 For this reader, the book's only weakness is Walton's final acceptance (having formed a personal friendship with screenwriter/producer Tracy Torme perhaps ex- plains it) of the film's underlying \"artistic\" integrity. Ufologists know UFOs don't look the way depicted and abductees don't get wrapped in a suffocating gunk cocoon. However, an untutored audience, taking these claimed visual metaphors as authentic experience, might properly conclude it was all a strange collective hallu- cination. The film almost encourages that belief by sug- gesting that Walton's first recall occurred as a terrifying flashback instead of his immediate conscious recall of the major elements of an alien abduction. I highly recommend this great read, powerfully aug- mented by eight pages of four-color illustrations by Mike Rogers (one of the loggers) and 16 pages of black and white photographs.

Following his own sighting of two UFOs on July 16, 1952 — later investigated by Blue Book and classified Unknown — the late NASA scientist Paul Hill began a quarter-century inquiry into what makes UFOs \"tick.\" Did they defy the laws of physics or merely demonstrate new applications?

Scott Grain, Jr. It's hard enough finding government scientists who may have intimate knowledge of how the military han- dled alleged UFO crashes in the late 1940's and early 1950's. When you do, then you have to find some way to get them to talk. Few do. There aren't that many left who are still living. Canadian UFO researcher Grant Cameron and I thought we had hit pay dirt when American physicist Dr. Robert Sarbacher stated that the one man he knew for sure who had participated in dis- cussions of reported UFO recoveries and their pilots was Dr. Eric A. Walker, the former President of the Pennsylvania State University. (For background infor- mation see the MUFON UFO Journal, No. 261, January 1990). Sarbacher said the Defense Department's Joint Research and Development Board held the UFO meet- ing at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in the early 1950s. At the time, Walker was serving as Executive Secretary of the R & D Board. According to researcher William Steinman, Walker corroborated Sarbacher's statement. During a telephone interview on August 30, 1987, Steinman said he asked Walker if he attended those UFO meetings, to which Walker allegedly responded, \"Yes, I attended meetings concerning that subject matter ...\" What really got us in- terested was when Steinman asked Walker if he could remember details of the UFO recovery operations and analysis of the saucer and bodies. Walker reportedly responded, \"I am sure that I have notes concerning those meetings at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. 1 would have to dig them out and read them over in order to jog my memory.\" The notebooks of those UFO meetings would be the key. That's what we wanted to see. For the next eight years Walker dodged not only us, but a number of UFO researchers and government officials attempting to find out what Walker knew. (See the MUFON UFO Journal, No. 323, March 1995). Dr. Walker died on February 17, 1995, of a heart ailment. It would be reasonable to con- clude that his records would be either a) kept in his wife's possession at home, b) possibly handed over to his children, or c) passed over to the Penn State University Archives, where Walker maintained an office until shortly before his death. Since I live less than eight miles from the University, I made several visits to the Archives, the latest on October 20, 1995, to look through Dr. Walker's papers. The collection consists of approximately 44 boxes of documents, letters, photo albums, newsclippings and other printed matter. A re- vised preliminary inventory of Dr. Walker's papers and memorabilia was prepared on May 6, 1995. The nine pages of listings are very abbreviated. The collection is open to anyone interested in examining the files and the only portions not permitted to be reproduced are those involving Walker's personal family matters. The records I examined were scant and incomplete. In a box labeled \"Report of Activities 1947-49,\" the bulk of the material consisted of letters written by Dr. Walker to others on various subjects, none of which were related to UFOs. I found no office diaries for 1947-49. Another troubling matter was the lack of material concerning Dr. Walker's relationship to the military's R & D Board. As Walker served as Executive Secretary, I expected to find some R & D notes. I could not locate any records or notes of meetings from the R & D ses- sions. In contrast, Dr. Walker also served as a member of the government's Institute of Defense Analysis, in which I found detailed notes of various meetings in a thick notebook of these sessions. The R & D notes should be in the University files, if they were turned over to them. Since Dr. Walker's wife is certainly up in years, I ap- proached Dr. Walker's son, Brian Walker, by letter, on October 31, 1995.1 outlined my desire to examine any notes/diaries of meetings Dr. Walker said he attended as Executive Secretary of the R & D Board and if the pa- pers were still at home, would it be possible to review them. Dr. Brian Walker responded on November 15, 1995, explaining that he received other requests similar to mine, no doubt precipitated by a book Cameron and I wrote highlighting Walker, published in 1991 by the Mutual UFO Network. Brian Walker wrote that all of his father's official pa- pers were given to Penn State University. He went on to say that he has reviewed some 10,000 pages of unofficial papers and found no mention of this information. Where are the R & D Board notes of Dr. Eric Walker? It is certainly possible Dr. Walker pulled these papers from his files before he died, and it's anyone's guess what he could have done with them. Earlier this year, I was sent several intelligence doc- uments from Dr. Walker's personal government file that showed he was appointed to the R & D Board on April 22, 1949, and served as Executive Secretary from August 1, 1950 to July 12, 1951. Sometime during that year, Walker is believed to have attended the UFO meet- ings that Sarbacher refers to.

I feel that the following is a problem for many MUFON State Directors and Section Directors. How many of you have called an investigator or trainee for an as- signment only to be told, \"I would like to help with the case but don't have the time,\" or \"I have a job that comes first\"? I have heard all of the reasons for not being available. My question is, why do these people join MUFON as in- vestigators or as an investigator trainee? If anyone is considering becoming an investigator, please keep in mind some important items. One, if you do not have the time to go on field investigations, do not request to be an investigator or investigator trainee. Two. the majority of state directors, section directors and investigators, do have full time jobs. But we still find time for MUFON. Three, if you are a MUFON investi- gator trainee, it is a prerequisite to obtain a copy of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual before you at- tend any training classes or go on field investigations. So the next time your membership is up for renewal, please change your status from Investigator or Trainee to Journal Subscriber if you do not have the time or desire to participate.

Haines says the object traveled 3900 feet in 30 seconds. That works out to 88.6 mph. not 192 mph. On page 9 Haines says a sighting duration of 60, 90 or 120 seconds corresponds to 95.3, 63.8, and 47.9 mph re- spectively. However, assuming the previously esti- mated distance of 3900 feet, the speeds should be 44.3, 29.55, and 22.15 mph, respectively. On page 10 Haines says if a path of 10,740 ft (2 miles) were traversed in 60, 90 or 120 seconds the speed would be 262, 175, and 131 mph, respectively. Mr. Haines needs some help with his arithmetic.

Rising in the ESE about 9:30 in mid-June, the im- posing giant moves across the southern sky during the night. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus reappears low in the ENE sky late in the month, rising about 3:30 AM by June 30. Mars (1.4). in Taurus, still is seen with difficulty low in the ENE at dawn. The red planet passes 4° below the Pleiades from June 10 to 13. Mercury lies 3° below Mars on the 14th (with the thin lunar crescent nearby), and Venus is 4° below it on June 30. Jupiter is in the SSW at dawn. The radiant planet lies 5° below the Moon on the 4th. Saturn (0.9). on the Pisces-Cetus border, rises in the E about 1:30 AM in midmonth. advancing to the ESE at dawn. The Jupiter Probe Tour: The Galileo spacecraft continues its two-year tour of Jupiter's satellite family, flying within about 600 miles of its largest moon Ganymede on June 27. Last December the craft's entry probe plunged into Jupiter's atmosphere, sending back some startling surprises. Preliminary results revealed a virtual ab- sence of the three layers of clouds expected, half the helium, few organic molecules, very little of the expected frequent lightning, much stronger winds than expected (up to 330 mph), and a new radiation belt. By chance the probe entered a clear \"window\" in the atmosphere, possibly accounting for some of the unanticipated results.

Second full moon called a ''blue moon.\" Last time this occurred was Aug. 1993: next time Jan. & Mar. 1999. The Stars: As the summer solstice approaches, the stars of a new season ascend the eastern sky led by the Summer Triangle. Each of the three stars is the brightest luminary in a constellation— Vega in Lyra the Harp, Deneb in Cygnus the Swan, and Altair in Aquila the Eagle. After evening twilight ends, find the four-sided \"Keystone\" of Hercules nearly overhead in the sky. About a third of the way down the western side of the Keystone is a dim fuzzy \"star.\" Actually this object isn't a single star at all but rather a sphere of hundreds upon thousands of stars called a globular cluster. While it is an engaging sight even in binoculars, a 4-inch tele- scope is needed to begin resolving a few of the stars. The Hercules Cluster is 21,000 light years distant. Low in the SE the scorpion Scorpius, with his bright red heart Antares, and to the E of it the archer Sagittarius roam the horizon heavens. DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE - Continued from Page 23 RENEWAL NOTICE Some members have not been renewing their member- ships until they receive the notification marked \"Your membership/subscription expires with this issue.\" In a few cases this renewal was not received in Seguin before the next monthly issue was mailed, thus they missed an issue. We notify members .one or two months in ad- vance by checking \"Your membership/subscription ex- pires within two months. Please renew now to avoid missing a single issue.\" It is advisable to renew when you receive this reminder. This is a more serious problem for foreign subscribers when it takes up to two months for surface mail delivery in some countries. By the time that their airmail renewal is received in Seguin, Texas, their subscriplion may have expired. It is therefore imperative that foreign subscribers renew upon receipt of the first renewal notice in order to maintain continuity of their monthly magazines. The address label on your Journal or the envelope, in the case of foreign members, has an expiration date at the lower right corner. It is the year and month when your last monthly Journal will be honored if you forget to re- new. As an example: 96/04 means that your expiration date and the last issue you will receive is April 1996. Foreign subscribers, in particular, have an opportunity to renew in sufficient time by noting this expiration date on the envelope address label, taking into consideration the excessive time for surface delivery. We do not want any- one to miss a single issue of the MUFON UFO Journal. MEDIA - Continued from Page 13 9) If your chapter is planning to have a guest lecturer who doesn't mind the publicity, arrange for the lecture to occur during \"sweeps week.\" Contact your local stations to find out when that week falls and offer to help the news director produce a segment on UFOS, centered around your speaker. 10) For best results, hand-carry well-written news releases to those reporters and editors you know will do a good job. If your chapter produces a newsletter, send free copies to all the media and to favored reporters.

MUFON NATIONAL UFO HOTLINE MUFON has been introducing its National UFO Hotline 1-800-UFO-2166 or 1-800-836-2166 to the public. Designed to obtain UFO sighting reports from police agencies nationwide, we are now prepared to expand its coverage. All State Directors were advised by a letter nearly a year ago to utilize this number for filing hot UFO cases that came to their attention. A letter an- nouncing the 800 number was mailed to all sheriff's of- fices and police chiefs in Texas during the spring of 1995 as a means of testing and evaluating the effective- ness of the system. The majority of our calls, to-date, have been from people who called the 800 directory and asked for \"UFO\" to report sightings or to seek UFO information. To send letters to every police department and sher- iff's office throughout the U.S.A. would obviously be both expensive and time-consuming. We would like for every State Director, State Section Director, Field Investigator, and Field Investigator Trainee to notify your local sheriff, police chief, and state highway patrol office of MUFON's 800 number via a postcard that they may post on their bulletin boards or at the dis- patcher's desk. Presently, we are attempting to answer all calls \"live.\" An answering box records the calls received late at night or early mornings. These sighting reports will be mailed or telephoned to the nearest State Section Director, State Director, or Field Investigator for a per- sonal interview. Brief replies to these cases under in- vestigation may be made to MUFON on the 800 num- ber. (The answering box is limited to three minutes.) However, this number is not to be used for other MU- FON communications. The MUFON business office number is (210) 379-9216. Please advise Walt Andrus by postcard or letter to which agencies you filed the UFO hotline number 1-800-UFO-2166. Our members are starting to get the word out, for which we thank you. A special thanks to our new Co-State Directors for Georgia; Kelley and Henry Owens, who wrote to all po- lice, 911, sheriffs, and Emergency Management Agencies in the state. FIELD INVESTIGATOR'S EXAMS Anyone who has purchased and studied the 4th edition of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual is eligible to take the exam via mail when they feel they are ready. The 100-question test may be secured from MUFON head- quarters in Seguin and returned to this office for grading. In localities where field investigator training classes are being conducted, the instructor may order sufficient quantities of the test and administer the exam at the completion of the training classes. For current mem- bers, the new manual may be purchased for $25 plus $3.50 for postage and handling from MUFON in Seguin. MUFON MOTTO CONTEST Believe it or not, MUFON is now in its twenty-sev- enth year and does not have a motto describing our goals and purpose. Yes, we are endeavoring to resolve the UFO phenomenon in a scientific manner, but we need a serious and \"catchy\" motto to use in the Journal, stationery, symposium programs, etc. It should be short, but yet very meaningful, such as \"Scientific Resolution of the UFO Phenomenon.\" A prize of $100 in MUFON publications will be awarded to the winner. The deadline for submission of your motto is June I, 1996. Put on your \"thinking-cap\" and come up with a unique and exciting motto for MUFON. (MUFON could also be used in the motto if this would make it more attrac- tive.) The response to this contest has been overwhelm- ing, with many people submitting multiple ideas. Keep the mottos coming.
