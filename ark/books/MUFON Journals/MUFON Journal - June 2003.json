First, lookouts are in an excellent position to spot anomalous objects, since their job is to scan the surround- ing countryside from.towers which provide commanding views. Doerter explains, \"Fire towers exist in remote sections of the country; and by plan offer almost unlimited visibility. The construction of the cabin is such that al- most anytime the lookout is on his feet, he or she is working.\" Secondly, there is a spe- : cial psychological factor which may affect these witnesses. Because of their isolated locales, look- outs have no immediate backup or support system to deal with an often up- setting sighting experi- ence, especially if there is a close encounter. For this reason, Doerter has ap- pealed to the Forest Ser- vice to set up a reporting system, to treat reports with respect, and to provide support as needed. \"Most contemporary readers may not be able to relate to the isolation involved in this work,\" says Doerter. \"Look- outs adjust to the conditions of being in remote locations, but problems can occasionally arise when unforseen events occur. Lookouts do see anomalous objects from time to time, and there is no, or very little, backup or sup- port for them when these experiences occur. \"The movements of these anomalous objects can be startling, stimulating, and frightening,\" he notes. \"This study shows that when these objects show unexpected and sudden movement directly to the lookout tower they caii cause great fear and anxiety. \"In this study I have found five instances where the lookouts have fled the area or hidden themselves in the tower in an attempt to shut out such experiences. In two such events the lookouts suspect that they may have been abducted.\" One such case involved a female lookout with more than 20 years of experience who was awakened by a vibrating sound which seemed to be coming from the grav- ity-feed water tank on the tower's roof. She also heard a humming sound, and the entire area (Continued on page 4) Dr. Jim Doerter The author Dr. James Doerter was a Forest Service lookout for five summers (1951-52-57-58-59) in the Mt. Hood, OR, and Mt. Adams, WA, districts. His academic background includes the B.S. from Indiana State College, the M.A. from Reed College, and the D.Ed, from Pennsylvania State University. He is a retired university professor of art. The study A Study of UFO Experiences and Anomalies as Reported by Forest Fire Lookouts and Forest Work- ers by Dr. Jim Doerter, 80 scenic Drive, Ashland, OR 97520. 8 1/2 X 11 spiral bound, 78 pages, PPd from the author for $12.00. This study was com- piled for submission to the U.S. Forest Ser- vice, with a goal of get- ting the Forest Service to encourage employ- ees to report anaomalies, and to support those em- ployees making such reports. The letters to and from the Forest Service contained in the back of this study indicate the frustration which the author had in trying, and failing, to work with the Forest Service on this project. The study includes 84 reports, divided into three categories: High Strangeness (HS), 16; Structured Craft (SC), 39; and Balls of Light (BOA), 29. One or two of the reports are well known, but most are not. The author notes that the study does not represent a complete compilation of the sightings of lookouts or other forestry workers, since his efforts to get coop- eration from the Forest Service were rebuffed. Not only was it difficult for him to locate lookouts, but many of those contacted were reluctant to share their sightings, since the Forest Service was not coop- erating, and lookout jobs are not easy to obtain. Sev- eral of those interviewed told their stories orally, but refused to write them down. About 70 percent of the witnesses did not want their names used. Dr. Doerter observes, \"It is clear that this subject intimidates both lookouts, workers, and supervisors.\" A welcome addition to this report are the many drawings of the objects by Dr. Doerter, some of which are reproduced in this article/review.

Get- ting out of bed, she observed a large orange cigar-shaped object in the distance. Her cat wedged itself under a cabinet and refused to move. Although she never saw the object projecting the light, she felt it was larger than the tower because of the large area covered by the light. She was too frightened to go outside and look. (See draw- ing HS 4, right upper) The witness says that after about 15 minutes observ- ing the phenomenon, she got the strong feeling that she should go back to bed and pretend to be asleep, which she did. She then fell asleep and did not awaken until 7 a.m. with the sun shining in her eyes, shocked that she had slept so late. Worse, she had dreamed that she had been taken somewhere, and feels it was aboard some type of craft. Doerter's studysuggests the following conclusions: 4 Most experienced lookouts contacted have not seen a UFO, but a significant number have. 4 The paths and directions of the objects seen indi- cate they are controlled movements. * Most of the objects are silent, whether moving or hovering. * About half the objects seen at great distance are balls of light or spheres. If the object approaches more closely, a definite shape is observed, or the object is so bright that the witness is momentarily blinded. * Some objects disappear while being viewed, but in one case an object appears to block an area of the sky, thus revealing its shape. * Most objects have circular or oval \"running lights,\" some in various colors, and some very bright. * Some objects appear to eject smaller objects which maneuver independently, then sometimes merge with the larger object. + Close approaches are very frightening. One such close approach, contributed to the study by researcher Greg Long, was near the South Fork of the Trinity River in northern California in 1981 or 1982. The witness, a lookout with 25 years of experience, was sit- ting on his bed when he observed two bright lights like the headlights on an auto, but even brighter than an airplane's landing lights. He turned off the lights in the tower and went outside to observe the object, which apparently was emitting no sound. The object, which initially seemed to be five to six miles away, was joined at the Trinity River by a similar object which came from the South Fork drainage area. Both objects moved toward the tower, coming within a mile at their closest approach. At this point the closest UFO was about the size of a 12-inch ruler held at arm's length, according to the witness. While both objects had the two white \"headlights,\" one of them also had a red light. The witness described the shapes of the objects as \"curious.\" Both objects flew north over Highway 3 and disappeared. The sighting had lasted about 15 minutes, and the lookout reported that the experience was fright- ening. Sometimes it is a member of a lookout's family who is involved with a sighting. In 1996 in northern California Drawing HS 4 Drawing HS-2 \"on a major mountain highway west of a city,\" the wife was returning home to the lookout tower after teaching a class at a community college when she saw lights up ahead. (See drawing HS-2 above.) Her first thought was that there had been an accident, and bright halogen lights must be in use. As she ap- proached the scene she had to partially block out the light with her hand in order to see the road. Driving even closer, she observed an object about 40 feet in length hov- ering about 20 feet from the ground, just off the highway. Now very frightened, she slowly drove past the clearly outlined object, getting as close as 50 to 100 feet of it, still partially blinded by the light. Page 4 MUFON UFO Journal June 2003"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Drawing HS-5 In addition to the object, she thinks she saw figures like small human beings beneath the object and in the air around the object. Strangely, shadows seemed to cast onto the object, even though the light seemed to be coming from it. She quickly left the area, but brought her husband back the next day to see if the object or figures had left any evidence, but they found nothing. She reports that she \"made a mistake\" and told someone about the sighting, and that she wants anonymity. Sometimes several members of a lookout's family see the anomaly. Lookout Lloyd Oliver, his wife, and their child were eating lunch on a clear day when the wife noticed an object of undetermined size which resembled a stove pipe. (See drawing HS-5 above.) It was bronze in color. The object approached the Olivers, hurtling end over end. then suddenly stopped, as if observing them. Oliver turned to get his binoculars, and at that point the object resumed its travel. Another unusual sighting occurred during the summer of 1991 at about 10:30 p.m. A Forest Service employee was invited to a home on the shore of a lake on the Mongollon Rim in Arizona in the area around Woods Can- yon for dinner. Dinner was nearly ready when the house generator quit. While his friend went out to restart the generator, the witness looked out toward the lake to see if he could spot any night fishermen. Suddenly the lake lit up all the way to the rock dam. The blinding bright light seemed to be swinging back and forth from shore to shore. There was no sound from the light, which was about 150 feet above the lake and about 400 yards away. (See drawing HS-6, right.) As the light moved toward the witness, his friend rushed in and pushed him into the bathroom and into a shower, telling the witness not to talk. As the light shined through the bathroom window, the friend seemed terrified, but the witness says he was \"only scared.\" After about five minutes the light seemed to go away. The friend said that the light had appeared before, but that he had always been able to reach the safety of his cabin. However, he had a flu-like illness, possibly con- nected with the light, and still has some sort of \"lung disease.\" Drawing SC-11 Drawing HS-6 Another encounter which occurred away from a look- out tower took place on a river. A law officer working with the Forest Service was running the Salmon River in Idaho with two other employees when the motor of the jet boat in which they were riding suddenly stopped. As they attempted to repair the motor they noticed a strange object hovering over the bank. (See drawing SC- 11 above.) Their boat floated past the blue disk, which June 2003 MUFON UFO Journal PageS"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Drawing SC-15 had an extended tripod, according to a report provided by Richard Seifried. Additional details were not included. When the officer reported the sighting to his superior he was told to \"shut up about it.\" A lookout and his girlfriend had a sighting of an object at the Delilah Lookout in the Sequoia National Forest in Fresno, CA. The source of this report was Loren Gross and the National UFO Reporting Center. The witness, Brian Allison of Visalia, CA, said that he and his girlfriend \"spotted something over a mountain range 20 miles away. It looked huge, like a flaming star.\" Through binoculars he could see metallic, electrical-look- ing flames shooting from the core of the object. Suddenly the flames \"collapsed in on themselves and sucked into the center, leaving a flashing light that jumped round in the sky, seemingly at random,\" said Allison. The object then moved almost directly over the witnesses, fly- ing in a mostly straight path, \"but jumped around from time to time.\" Keeping his binoculars on the object, Allison noted that it was circular in shape, with multi-colored lights moving around the edge. There was a smaller red light on top, and a large white light on the bottom. The girlfriend reportedly became frightened and ran into the house. The object moved \"at a sort of 45-degree angle,\" apparently stopping over Woodlake or Lindsay. Then from the direction of Lemoore Naval Air Station came five or six lights that behaved like helicopters. As these lights approached the original light, it suddenly shot straight up \"in a blink of an eye.\" A report provided by Jan Aldrich described a sighting by 31-year-old Art Hatch. The primary witness was eat- ing lunch which he saw two objects \"shaped like two soup bowls turned upside down.\" They were a dull \"white- Drawing SC-3 silvery\" color, and were about 5,000 feet high when spot- ted. (See drawing SC-15, above left.) A lookout in the upper west tower on Flattop Mountain in the Mt. Adams District, Trout Lake, WA, in the Pinchot Forest, spotted a point of light rapidly become larger. He called for his wife, ran downstairs, and met his wife at a window. The point of light seemed to come from the Mt. Hood area, moving at high speed and becoming a giant shape. The bottom of the object seemed to block out the sky, and appeared to be 300-400 feet across, although this had to be judged by the apparent size of the ring of flashing red and white lights around the object. The craft itself could not be seen, but appeared to be like a pie pan slightly tilted. (See drawing SC-2, above.) The object came directly toward the tower, about 1,000 feet high, then at the last moment veered towards Mt. Adams, disappearing behind tall trees. Throughout the sighting, no sound was heard. A daylight sighting at Sopelia Lookout on the Yakima Page 6 MUFON UFO Journal June 2003"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Drawing SC-8 Indian Reservation in Washington was reported by Dor- othy Sturm, an experienced lookout, who has reported other sightings. The Yakima Reservation was a hotbed of sightings in the 1970's, with about 200 incidents reported. Sturm was looking out a window on a Sunday after- noon in 1964 when she spotted a shining object down a ridge about a half mile away. It looked like a pie pan hanging at an angle. (See drawing SC-3, previous page.) She turned to get her binoculars, but when she looked for the object it was gone. At that point she heard a noise above the lookout tower which sounded like \"a deep whirlpool or the last water going down the drain.\" She went to the door to go out- side to look, but \"had a strange feeling,\" and could not open the door. \"I knew if I did,\" she said, \"I'd never come back in. I can't explain it.\" In September, 1984, at about 8:45 p.m.. a lookout was putting her son to bed when she observed a cluster of red and blue lights to the northeast. About ten minutes later a smaller cluster of lights, red and blue with a white light at the center, quickly dropped from the middle of the big craft, stopping before hitting the ground. (See drawing SC-8, above.) The smaller cluster slowly moved below the horizon, and the larger object drifted southeast. However, a small pod had stayed with the large object. About twenty minutes later she watched two small pods and another cluser of white lights which seemed to rise at times and hover at other times. She observed these anomalies until about midnight, slept a couple of hours, and awakened around 2 a.m. and the large object was still visible. Drawing SC-4 Throughout the sighting she noticed no sound. All of the objects were gone by morning. Another lookout also saw the objects. A sighting reminiscent of the Travis Walton encounter occurred in 1950 on Highway 26 near Maupin Junction, OR. A forester and fellow worker were on a straight stretch of road when an object suddenly appeared just above the treetops about 60 yards ahead of them. The object was round, and about 80 feet in diameter. The perimeter of the object was lighted, and there was a glow under the object. (See drawing SC-4, above.) The witnesses could see the details of tree limbs and even the needles of the fir trees in front of the object. There appeared to be no windows on the object, no exhaust emissions, or other notable details. The object remained motionless for a time, then quickly swerved to the right of the witnesses and vanished. Doerter notes that natural phenomena have been con- sidered in looking at these cases, and his report includes brief descriptions of the characteristics of comets, mete- ors, St. Elmo's fire, ball lightning, earth lights, weather balloons, and sun dogs or false suns. He points out that many lookouts simply will not dis- cuss their sightings, and this can be frustrating for the researcher. There was, for example, a second-hand re- port by a lookout concerning another lookout and his wife experiencing a sighting \"so dramatic that it caused their dogs to run off for three days.\" The primary witness is now a law enforcement officer, and will not talk about the event.

The parties include well-known magician and debunker the \"Amaz- ing\" Randi; Vaughn Rees, projects coordinator for CFI West in Los Angeles; and Michael Shermer, science writer and skeptic. It all began in February of 2001, when I met with Mr. Rees and showed him several of Mr. Meier's 35mm pho- tos of UFOs as well as several 8mm movie segments of these objects. Mr. Rees promptly declared that the mate- rial was simply an \"easily duplicated hoax.\" He accused Mr. Meier of faking the remarkable light effects displayed by one UFO on the film by \"scratching it with a pin.\" I then challenged Mr. Rees to duplicate one of Mr. Meier's photos and one of his film segments. Mr. Rees accepted and stated that he would do it with the same kind of equipment, a 35mm camera and an 8mm movie camera.   , Several months later, having received no items from Mr. Rees. I invited him to forgo the cameras and use computers, digital effects, Photo Shop any technology that he had access to in order to produce the items. (1 also suggested that, if he wanted to be sporting about it, Mr. Rees should use one hand, since Mr. Meier only has one himself.) In February of 2003, at an expo in Los Angeles, Mr. Rees told me that he was waiting for a new photographic lab to be finished at CFI West so as to finally produce the photos. I reminded him that Mr. Meier never had any such lab and that, in a two-year period, Mr. Meier had taken literally hundreds of photos, some with up to four UFOs in them. A few months prior to that I had written to Michael Shermer, who is also a contributor to Skeptic magazine, and presented information to him on the Meier case. With- out any examination of the evidence, Mr. Shermer of- fered a sweeping dismissal, claiming that he knew \"little children\" who could create great faked UFO photos. Just recently, I wrote to Mr. \"Amazing\" himself, in hopes that there was something of substance to these skeptics instead of mere blustering and braggadocio. I challenged him to look at the Meier material, includ- ing the wide range of prophetically accurate information (such as Mr. Meier's warning, in 1995, of the recent at- tack on Iraq), and debunk it if he could. (It should be noted that Randi is a famous debunker known for his sup- posed $ 1,000,000 offer to anyone who can actually prove a paranormal claim.) All Randi could offer was a comment about how a \"child\" could \"see through the farce\" and his own claims that Mr. Meier never published any prophetically accurate information! Not only was Randi, like Mr. Page 8 Shermer, seeming to rely on children for expertise in this matter, he was, without knowing it, making Mr. Rees' efforts look pathetically inept, coming up as less compe- tent than a child. Additionally, it was obvious that Randi, like Mr. Shermer, had absolutely no knowledge of Mr. Meier's material and was dismissing it out of hand. When I challenged him further, by emphasizing CFI West's failure to duplicate Mr. Meier's evidence, Randi's final response was even more \"amazing.\" He said, \"So what value is duplication? CAN MR. MEIER PROVE HIS CASE? NO. Case closed.\" I wondered if this was the kind of science Randi had in mind when he once stated, \"Science is best defined as a careful, disciplined, logical search for knowledge about any and all aspects of the universe, obtained by examina- tion of the best available evidence and always subject to correction and improvement upon discovery of better evi- dence. What's left is magic. And it doesn't work.\" Skeptics have suggested Meier used elaborate minia- ture trees to achieve such shots. The controversy of his images continues to this day. But, just when I thought it couldn't get any more bizarre, I received an email from a Mr. Andrew Harter, also an associate of Randi's. And just what did Mr. Harter have to add to the mix? \"A back issue of Skeptic magazine has photos made by 10-year-olds that are just as good as anything Mr. Meier ever made. There's your proof.\" Oh no, it was the children-as-special-effects-experts defense again (and further humiliation for Mr. Rees and CFI West!) Plus, while Mr. Harter's confidence was almost admi- rable, he hadn't sent even one photo from these anony- mous, precocious, prepubescent prodigies to back it up. I felt like I had just pulled the curtain away from the wizard(s). Suddenly, I was the skeptical debunker dealing with fringe type wackos who make wild claims and then refuse to provide any evidence to substantiate them! It appears that the effect of the Billy Meier UFO case on the professional skeptics has been similar to pouring drain cleaner down a clogged pipe. At first you may get strange stuff boiling up, and then some messy, smelly things get flushed away. Maybe, with these clowns and illusionists being shown for the posturing charlatans they are, the Billy Meier UFO case will finally be judged on its own significant merits, and not by prejudiced, non-scientific, sectarian cults such as the \"professional\" skeptics. -Michael Horn Friedman's thinking outdated? Stanton Friedman's \"Perceptions\" article in the April issue, while criticizing those who question UFO reality because of their limited understanding of physics, still seems wedded to outdated thinking about what must be the nature of UFO propulsion systems. Countless eye-witness accounts of non-ballistic mo- tion of UFOs, as well as the testimony of Bob Lazar and others, seems convincing evidence that we are witness- ing inertial-less, field propulsion systems.

It just appears that the aliens break into certain individual's homes, sometimes literally dragging people out of their beds at night to perform intrusive and invasive, sometimes painful, experiments on their subjects, all without human consent. Often people are scarred for life, both physically and mentally. Women are repeatedly impregnated like labora- tory rats, raped, or forced into sexual situations. The ex- periments sometimes make them physically sick, while their captors stand by and do nothing to relieve their sick- ness. This is done to the poor victims and to their families for years, and no one wants to believe their stories or even want to believe that they are victims. To the \"Positive\" thinkers, the aliens are thought to be doing some spiritual favors in the big picture for these individuals and the planet if we just look deeper. The aliens are breeding a hybrid race just to come around to say \"hello\" to us one day while the space ships are targeting all of our military defense sites? (Surely they have no intentions of taking them all out one day; all friends target your defense sites). The aliens tell the abductees to be concerned about the planet and the environment (looks like they have an investment in it), but they seem to play down attention to human problems like our elderly, our dying, cancer vic- tims, AIDS victims, poverty, and crime. (No, I guess that Photos needed The MUFON UFO Journal welcomes photos from MUFON meetings and other events. Please clearly list, left to right, who is in the photo and what is taking place.

They often match up an abductee with a hybrid who will repeatedly rape her or force her into sexual situations during her life, and if he's a woman abuser, too bad, no alien in high command to complain to. But yes the \"Posi- tives,\" the well wishers who think the aliens are here to help us, will overlook this. Breaking into someone's home to experiment on them- surely an advanced race couldn't figure out this would be unethical and uncivilized in our culture and society? They couldn't have just asked for our help? No. And do you know why they did not? Because they know we would never have agreed to what they are doing to our people. Despite the \"Positives\" belief, they have an agenda all right, only it isn't ours, it's theirs. Do you ever wonder why the aliens never tell us what their agenda is if it were for our benefit? Some abductees say that they feel somehow that they have benefited spiritually from their abductions. Given the alien's ability to use mind control, which I have read about over and over again, I even found a case where a woman was even used to abduct another fellow human being. We have no concept as to what they are capable of, and therefore a woman could even be raped and be left thinking she benefited from the experience. Of course nothing I say here can be proven, as alien abduction itself can't be proven without a doubt, but I feel there is a whole lot of evidence to support what I have just said. -Mrs. Patricia Themaras June 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Ufblogy Profile Lt. Col. Wendelle Stevens By Dwight Connelly \" T t. Col. Wendelle Stevens, UFO author, photo col- lector, investigator, and lecturer, is probably best iown for his work on the controversial Eduard (Billy) Meier contact case in Switzerland-a saga which began for Stevens in 1976, and which continues today. A book on this case, UFO Con- tact from the Pleiades, Vol- ume I, was'published by Stevens in 19.79. In 1982 an edition limited to 2,000 copies, subtitled A Preliminary Investigation Report, was published. Origi- nally selling for $17.95, the 542-page hard bound report now sells for up to $100 or more in the used book mar- ket. Stevens was born in Little Sauk, MN, population 200, and attended a one-room school, graduating from Long Prairie. MN, High School. He had joined the Army National Guard during his last year in high school, then went into the military full time after graduation. His goal was to become a pilot (the separate Air Force had hot yet been formed), but he was made a tank mechanic. Refusing to give up his goal of flying, Stevens was able to get transferred from tank repair to aircraft repair. His next step was to apply for sergeant-pilot training in 1940, just a year prior to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and America's entry into World War II. \"I was the last one to get this,\" he explains, \"then I was transferred to the flying warrant officer program.\" He was one of the 10 percent in the program to get a commission as a second lieutenant. This led to Stevens becoming a pilot at San Antonio, where he learned to fly \"all the Army planes, plus some Navy planes,\" finally realizing his original dream of be- coming a fighter pilot. He was still in training when Pearl Harbor was attacked, and was shipped to the Pacific area of operations and put in charge of an aircraft servicing area. Near the end of the war, he was ordered to replace a sick pilot who was part of a VIP flight to a Japanese airfield-prior to the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki-to work out surrender terms for ending the war. Stevens and other members of the group assisted Japanese pilots in removing propellers to make their planes inoperative, although there were still Wendelle Stevens, left, talks with a member of the audience following a presentation at the Ozark UFO Conference. flights of Kamakazi pilots during this same period. >. Following the surrender, Stevens was scheduled to be discharged, but he wanted to stay in the military, and was sent to Wright Field, OH, as a pilot in a B-19 project. He was temporarily assigned to Randolf Field, Texas, \"where there were Blue Berets, who were assigned to UFO re- covery.\" Then he was sent back to Wright Field in 1947, where he worked in Air Technical Intelligence. Stevens was rotated to Alaska as an Operations staff officer for the \"Ptarmigeon\" Project, a weather reconnaissance program, \"plus supervising a highly-classified staff from Wright,\" The Alaska operation in- cluded a specially-equipped B-29 which surveyed the area in grid patterns, \"look- ing for UFOs, among other things,\" says Stevens. \"It was loaded with still and movie cameras, surge de- tectors, magnetic and ther- mal detectors, and geother- mal and magnetic cam- eras. One of Stevens'jobs was to brief the departing crews, but he was not cleared to see the results of the flights. He did hear reports, however, of UFOs being sighted and filmed by the crews. \"One report was of a very large object sitting on an ice pack, which jumped up and disappeared,\" he says. \"There were three to four reports monthly of unidentified ob- jects. One even submerged into the water. These re- ports were all forwarded to Washington.\" After this experience, Stevens was hooked on the UFO phenomenon, and began collecting magazine articles, news clips, books, and especially photos. Following Alaska, he was sent to Homestead Air Force Base in Florida. He began to informally check out UFO sightings on his own time, interviewing witnesses as his Air Force duties took him from place to place. In 1964, now a lieutenant colonel with 24 years of service, he retired, moving to Tucson, AZ, where he still lives. He continued to be involved with aircraft as a retiree, selling multi-engine former military aircraft, getting them in shape for flying, and delivering them to buyers. How- ever, he now considers himself a private full-time UFO investigator. Although he never joined any UFO organization, he Page 10 MUFON UFO Journal June 2003"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"worked closely with the Tucson-based Aerial Phenom- enon Research Organization (APRO), headed by Jim and Coral Lorenzen, following his retirement from the Air Force. Since he owned a small plane, Stevens flew the Lorenzens to interview various witnesses. One of the cases he worked on with APRO was the Travis Walton case in Arizona in 1975, as well as the somewhat similar case of Air Force Sgt. Charles Moody in New Mexico about the same time. \"Sgt. Moody was physically affected when we took him to revisit the quarry site,\" says Stevens. \"The Air Force suddenly sent him to Spain, but the contacts contin- ued there.\" Relations with APRO soured, however, when Coral Lorenzen accused Stevens of stealing the Meier case from them. Stevens says, however, that he became involved with the Meier case as a result of wanting to add to his now extensive photo collection. \"Ms. Lou Zinsstag, a UFO researcher in Switzerland, had investigated the Meier case,\" he explains, \"and had some of the many photos he had taken. She thought the case was genuine, and know- ing of my interest in UFO photos, we arranged to meet when she visited in Tucson in September of 1976. It was then that I saw the Meier photos for the first time.\" Ms. Zinsstag, accompanied by Tim Good, was in the U.S. doing research on a biography of alleged contactee George Adamski. Stevens says his initial reaction to the photos was that they were fakes. \"They were just too clear and too sharp, especially since they were supposedly taken by a one- armed man with a damaged camera. I had seen a lot of UFO photos by this time, and these did not look at all like the others. They looked like the UFOs had stopped and posed. I later learned that this was exactly what they had done, but at the time Iwas quite skeptical.\" However, after talking extensively with Ms. Zinsstag, who had published the first UFO journal in central Eu- rope, and who had written several articles and a book on UFOs, Stevens decided to follow up on the case. On Oct. 21,1977, Stevens went to Switzerland to be- gin his personal investigation of the Meier case. He re- turned to Switzerland again on April 1, 1978, spending another week with Meier, his family, and other witnesses. He examined additional photos, as well as a piece of metal from what was being referred to as \"the Pleiadian spacecraft.\" He also listened to recordings of the sounds of the spacecraft, made in the presence of other witnesses. He was back in Switzerland again in July of 1978, spending another two weeks with the Meiers, checking out photo sites and taking measurements. \"After viewing the photos and the sites,\" says Stevens, \"I was struck by the singular impossibility of using models from any of these positions.\" Through the years Stevens has continued to study the case. There have been scientific analyses of Meier's nu- merous photos, as well as the pieces of metal, sound re- cordings, and even a hair from an alleged entity (incon- clusive). From the beginning, he has emphasized the need to thoroughly investigate the tangible evidence, and, though Mutual UFO Network Colorado MUFON was the winner of the first phase of the MUFON membership drive. Colorado State Director Leslie Varnicle displays the night vi- sion scope which the group won. convinced of the validity of the case, he still is not through investigating it. In fact, he plans still another trip to Swit- zerland this coming summer. Stevens is a regular presenter each spring at Lou Parish's Ozark UFO Conference, specializing in contact and photo cases, and this year returned to again update the Meier case. He also continues to collect, exchange, and sell UFO photos. Over the past half century he has amassed more than 4,500 photos, carefully filed in 40 binders. \"At least 90 percent of my photos are legitimate unknowns,\" he says. \"Good hoaxes are difficult, but if I'm convinced a photo is a fake, I throw it out. I don't like science fiction at all. Truth is more exciting.\" Jupiter's Europa appears to be covered with layer of water From various observations, both from Earth and pass- ing spacecraft, scientists have concluded that Jupiter's Europa is covered with a layer of water probably 50 to 100 miles thick, surrounding a rocky core. \"What we find in these pictures,\" says Michael Carr of the US Geological Survey in Menlo Park, California \"is pretty good evidence there is water at fairly shallow depths on Europa.\" The surface is undeniably solid ice, though fractured and blistered into a ball-of-string appear- ance. The question: is there, beneath the ice, any liquid water? Another tantalizing observation: Europa's surface, un- like the other moons of Jupiter, is relatively clean of cra- ters. Perhaps eruptions of water from below had filled them in. And that environment would resemble the vol- canic rifts that lie at the bottom of the Earth's ocean, an environment now known to teem with exotic organisms.

Object heads for pickup in Chile SANTIAGO â Electrical engineer Roberto Caceres, 36, lived through a terrifying experience last February in. Chile's 9th Region. For 15 minutes he was followed by a light that caused him to lose control of his vehicle mo- mentarily. Once a year he drives to the country's southern reaches to make contacts for his electrical appliance store. Last February, he was driving to the small town of Freire. He states, \"I was driving along very calmly. Some 15 minutes from Temuco, I saw a strange white light on my right that was matching my speed. \"I thought it was the train, but it wasn't, and in a matter of seconds that light crossed right in front of my pickup truck. The UFO headed for my truck. I swerved to avoid it several times. It nearly hit me. It must have been the shape of a football. But I don't think it had a defined body-it was pure light. But it moved at incredible speeds.

They reported seeing a huge dark colored object in the shape of a flying cross. The reporting witness says the body of the object was certainly longer than the wing span. It moved very slowly without sound. The bottom of the object had six panels of colored lights. They were unable to see the height or the thickness of the fuselage. It was just too dark, and the bright colored lights on the bottom of it obscured the view. This sighting lasted almost ten seconds before they lost sight of it due to the tree line blocking their view. The object was the size of a 737 jet airliner, but it had no flashing lights. Brian Vike says, \"I received a very similar sighting report last year.\" Strange creature reported in Michigan CAPAC â The witness reports, \"I woke up to take a pain reliever at midnight, turned on the TV and sat on the living room couch facing the window, when a creature ran across my porch on March 28,2003. I quickly jumped up and looked out the door to see it run around the corner of my house on the porch. \"It was of average height, but had abnormally long arms. Its arms and legs were somewhat spiny, and it had a larger than normal bald head. I did not get a good look at the face but I could tell that it was not human. \"Within a few seconds of this, the lights went out and I could see two large blue spotlights in the sky moving as if it was searching for something. The spotlights were in the field across from me about 800 feet. As they moved away, the power came back on. \"This morning I called my friend, and she said her elec- tricity and lights had gone off, and she also saw the blue lights in the sky. She then told me that people around here don't talk about these things.\" Thanks to Peter Dav- enport www.UFOCENTER.com Air Force says UFOs are real Many people ask me, why do you believe in UFOs? While I was in the Air Force I chased them and saw reliable messages indicating their reality. The following message is based on the testimony of a high-ranking Swed- ish Air Force Officer. There are thousands of documents at the National Archives that prove the US military also believed in their existence. For example: This National Archives declassi- fied Top Secret memo dated 4 Nov 1948 clearly shows the USAF was concerned about UFOs. The United Air Forces in Europe Office of Intelligence sent a message to Headquarters stating: \"For some time we have been concerned by the recur- ring reports on flying saucers. They periodically continue to crop up; one was observed hovering over Neubiberg Air Base for about thirty minutes. They have been re- ported by so many sources and from such a variety of places, we are convinced that they cannot be disregarded and must be explained on some basis, which is perhaps slightly beyond the scope of our present intelligence think- ing. \"One of these objects was observed by a Swedish tech- nical expert near his home on the edge of a lake. The object crashed or landed in the lake, and he carefully noted its azimuth from his point of observation. Swedish intelli- gence was sufficiently confident in his observation that a naval salvage team was sent to the lake. \"Operations were underway during the visit of USAFE officers. Divers had discovered a previously uncharted crater on the floor of the lake. No further information is available, but we are promised knowledge of their re- Page 12 MUFON UFO Journal June 2003"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"suits. In their opinion, the observation was reliable, and they believe that the depression on the floor of the lake, which didn't appear on current hydrographic charts, was in fact caused by a flying saucer. \"Although accepting this theory of the origin of these objects poses a whole new group of questions and puts much of thinking in a changed light, we are inclined not to discredit entirely this somewhat spectacular theory, mean- time keeping an open mind on the subject. What are your reactions?\" Thanks to Ryan A.

They are the first pyramids ever discov- ered in Italy, and the dimensions are quite impressive; the highest pyramid is 150 meters tall. They are stone buildings, as recent excavations have proved. They are now completely covered by ground and vegetation, so that they now look like hills. The inclina- tion degree of all the three pyramids is 42/43Â° and there is a perfect alignment with the Orion constellation and many similarities to the Egyptian pyramids. Their age is still unknown, but they are surely older than 3000 years. Nothing was found nearby which may help to date the structures. The people who lived there were mainly gatherers and hunters.

We were dry-docking in Marseilles, France. \"About October 17, 1974, eight crew members were on the aft deck waiting for water to fill the dry-dock. It was about 1:30 PM with a clear blue sky and a bright light was hovering above the city. It was flying at 150 meters in altitude and one or two kilometers from the dry-dock. The light was as bright as a star and had a diameter 1/4 of the full moon. \"We didn't hear any sound coming from that strange light, so it was unlikely to be a helicopter that can easily be heard at that distance. Our nautical officer was quite sure this light was neither a star nor a planet. After thirty minutes the light was still in the same position and we saw a smaller light that moved slowly out of the city to- wards the big light. \"On approaching the big light, the small light reduced speed and very slowly it entered into the big light. We were all stunned. Five minutes later, the light flew at incredible speed straight up and disappeared in space. I was a 17-year-old boy and I knew nothing about UFOs. After my sighting I started reading a lot about UFOs, and I became a real and strong believer. I saw, so I believe!

Each flying triangle craft looked like there were three balls attached together to form a single craft in the shape of a triangle. The eyewitness said, \"Each craft was luminous, like you could see through them, but you couldn't. Both passed directly under the moon, making it easy to see that they were not weather balloons. \"There was no sound as they passed. No flashing lights could be seen, and they both had a very soft silver/blue glow as they glided along. There were also aircraft with flashing lights that could be seen off to the right of the flying triangles. They veered off to the right. I ran through the house, grabbing my husband and son so they could also see them, but the only thing left in the sky to see was the plane.\" Rolling object reported in Kentucky LOUISVILLE - The witness reports a strange object moved slowly over his head and then rolled over several times and moved off in a different direction on May 11, 2003. At 8:55 PM it was twilight outside and the craft appeared to be a dark color. The observer states, \"It was shaped like a yellow jacket (bee), and looked like it had something like wings on both sides in the front and back. I did not see any lights on the craft, and it moved slow right over my head. \"It was very cloudy out, and the craft seemed to be just under the cloud cover. It flew right over my head, rolled over several times, and changed direction. I was yelling for my wife to come look at it, but by the time she got out on the deck all she saw was a black dot on the horizon. \"I have never seen anything like this before. It may have been a large balloon like the size used in a parade caught in the wind but I don't know.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport NUFORC Diamond-shaped object in Arkansas On May 7, 2003, at 2 AM, the observer spotted a diamond-shaped fuselage with multiple red and white lights.

The employee provided Davenport with the name and telephone number of the individual with whom the FAA had spoken, a California Highway Patrol officer who had described to them his alleged sighting earlier in the morn- ing. NUFORC spoke with the officer for 25 minutes, and he described having witnessed a very bizarre-looking, disc- shaped object in the skies above \"the freeway\" in the vicinity of Goleta, CA. The officer had witnessed the object for an estimated 30 minutes, and several of his family members had also witnessed the same object from a different location in Santa Barbara. The officer stated that he first thought the object might be some type of kite, but then abandoned that notion, as he continued to watch it. The object was circular in appearance, and it was \"tum- bling, end over end.\" He was facing north, and the object was moving to the north, away from his location, prob- ably passing over the Santa Barbara Beach. He assumed that other reports might have been sub- mitted to the Santa Barbara police or sheriff, although those two offices reported that, to the best of their knowl- edge, no reports had been submitted to them. It flew to- wards Vandenberg AFB. Thanks to Peter Davenport. Large triangular object in Washington State LAKE WASHINGTON â The witness reports, \"As I was entering the 1-90 runnel leading into Seattle I saw a large craft very low to the ground on April 30, 2003, at 11:41 PM. \"As I came out of the tunnel into the city, I turned around to see if it had crashed, and saw instead a large triangular craft with many lights on the bottom flying very slowly and low over homes. It was flying slowly for a craft of its size. \"I couldn't stop to get a better look, since I was on the freeway. When I turned my head again I couldn't find it anymore from the night sky.\" NUFORC Note: We spoke with this witness at con- siderable length, and she seemed quite serious-minded, and quite credible. She described the incident quite lu- cidly and eloquently. She reported that when she first sighted the triangular object, it was moving from her left to right (north), and then it suddenly dipped its nose down, and reversed the direction it was moving, in less than one-second (esti- mate). Thanks to Peter Davenport, NUFORC. We seem to be related to Dolphins For years, marine biologists have told us that dolphins share many traits with humans, including intelligence and friendliness. Now, a comparison of dolphin and human chromosomes shows that the genetic make-up of dolphins is amazingly similar to humans. In fact, researchers have found that dolphins have more in common with us geneti- cally than cows, horses, or pigs. \"The extent of the genetic similarity came as a real surprise to us,\" says David Busbee of Texas A&M Uni- versity, who published his results in last week's Cytoge- netics and Cell Genetics. Researchers at Texas A&M University applied \"paints,\" or fluorescently labeled human chromosomes, to dolphin chromosomes, and found that 13 of 22 dolphin chromosomes were exactly the same as human chromo- somes. Of the remaining nine dolphin chromosomes, many were combinations or rearrangements of their human counterparts. Researchers also identified three dolphin genes that were similar to human genes. \"Dolphins are marine mam- mals that swim in the ocean, and it was astonishing to learn that we had more in common with the dolphin than with land mammals,\" says Horst Hameister, professor of medical genetics at the University of Ulm in Germany. In the past 15 years, the world's dolphin populations have declined considerably,'exacerbated by high levels of PCBs which impair the immune systems of dolphins, leav- ing them vulnerable to disease. Anything that endangers dolphins is of an equal concern for humans. We need to persuade governments to become serious about combat- ing industrial pollution and keeping oceans clean.

Ukraine witness reports strange observation SIMFEROPOL â A local resident reported that in the evening, when he went on to his balcony of the multistoried building, he dazedly noticed the strangest scene he ever saw in his life. A ray of light descended from the sky, pointing at a nearby balcony. Suddenly, a totally naked man appeared in the center of this light right on the balcony. The UFO itself was obviously hovering above, but it was not visible. Only the ray of light shinning down could be seen. The man was apparently half-conscious. Being frightened, the witness left his balcony and hur- ried back into his flat in fear that he might be abducted too. Correction: California, not New Mexico The sighting reported last month of two F-16's appar- ently pursuing a cigar-shaped object on April 5,2003, took place over Los Alamos, CA, not Los Alamos, NM. An alert reader, Kenneth Ewing, of Los Alamos, NM, spotted the error, and checked with the National UFO Reporting Center web site to verify the correct location. The fact that Vandenberg AFB was mentioned in the report should have tipped us off, but we at the Journal were not as alert as Mr. Ewing.

In the year 2000, Neb and his Navajo friend, Don Began, sailed Neb's 29-foot yacht from Baca, CA, to Hawaii. Af- ter spending a few days in Ha- waii, they returned by sailing the 3200-mile voyage to San Francisco. Shortly after departing La Paz, the excitement began with a not-so-distant light show above them, changing colors, making 360-degree loops, buzzing them, and performing other antics not common to conventional aerial objects. Initially Neb and Don were excited by the show, but as this continued most every day and night, the excitement turned to concern as they increasingly came to fear for their safety. As the days passed, it was clear that they were being followed. A log was kept of these events, and along with binoculars and camcorder, they were able to develop fairly accurate sketches. Turning their searchlight towards the nearby space contrivances brought a reaction from the aerial vehicles. It was concluded, in time, that these must be under intelligent control, but what puzzled them most was why they were being watched.

It is one that literally seeks to break new ground and bring UFOlogy to the whole world at the touch of a button. What this site does is to take one of Britain's most fa- mous cases and present virtu- ally everything that is known about it in a way that will al- low all who access this virtual case file to have the opportu- nity to form their own opinions. It is, I believe, an exciting pointer to the way in which the power of the internet can be harnessed to the benefit of all. UFOsonthenet Until now most UFO web sites are designed to be pro- motional or conversational. There are chat lists, such as Updates (North America) and Ufologyinuk (which does what it says on the label- discusses UFOlogy in the UK!). Then there are sites that tell the world about a group or book or conference or whatever. There is no doubting the efficacy of all these things, but I have long felt that UFOlogy has never really found ways to use the internet in the form that it might have its most important advantages. There have been some innovative ideas. For instance, there is a site (hauntedvalley.com) which has a web cam- era pointed at the Longendale Valley of the Pennine Hills, scene of countless light-in-the-sky type UFO encounters in the past (see my recent book Supernatural Pennines- Robert Hale, London 2003). This allows the viewer to skywatch from his or her own home, watching one of the world's major hotspots. Although I am not aware of any successful sightings made in virtual space, this surely has to be a concept that could be more broadly exploited. Now this new British site, largely designed by Martin Shough (but with input from several UFOlogists in the UK who have been working on the case for some years), sets another new direction that I hope will be emulated. The case that this mammoth new site is exclusively devoted to is the famed radar-visual in August 1956 in and around Bentwaters and Lakenheath Air Force bases in England. This is one event that the infamous Condon Report failed to explain, and pronounced as highly likely to involve a real UFO. The Lakenheath-Bentwaters site Very briefly, the event involves some of the most seem- ingly impressive evidence in UFO history. Multiple radar trackings over a several-hour period described rapidly moving targets that crossed the skies above the eastern part of the country, then liberally covered by major air bases and at the frontline of a perceived attack from the USSR. During the various incidents that followed, there were reports of lights seen from the ground, an airborne sight- ing from a USAF transport plane, and, most significant of all, a mid-air encounter during which two RAF Venoms were scrambled to intercept and (according to the testi- mony in the Condon report) had an aerial encounter with a strange light seen visually and on radar. This obiect then played \"tag\" with the one jet that stuck the course, streaking in a moment from in front of to be- hind the fighter to the shock of its crew. Together this evidence seems to reflect almost the perfect UFO close encounter. However, there were huge problems. The case barely exists on official British government records of the day- only tantalising references on the public record, mostly signifying the defence ministry's satisfaction that the af- fair was covered up! Nothing made the media at the time, or, indeed, had done so after that day until a decade later the Condon team got data from a USAF serviceman in- volved. Unfortunately, this sole point of information made much of the story (especially the part about the RAF involve- ment) second hand. As it turned out, this was a major problem. The new investigation Only in 1995 did things change significantly, when, by good fortune, I was able to speak to the two navigators who were aboard two Venoms that were scrambled that night. In making a documentary for the BBC (that I had scripted and presented), I took them both back to Lakenheath to film the now elderly men reliving the event from what was then 40 years earlier. What was of most interest was that the two were adamant that they saw nothing visually, that the radar tar- get was stationary, that the \"cat and mouse\" chase re- ported was a misnomer, as they merely flew at speed past the invisible object, thus causing it to move from in front to behind them by perfectly ordinary means, and that they thought the UFO was a weather balloon. Although they admitted no hard evidence for this, and some reasons for possible suspicion (such as the low alti- Page 16 MUFON UFO Journal June 2003"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"rude), their story was worryingly very different from that reflected by the Condon report-although sufficiently alike to suggest that they were describing the same case. In- deed, their log books, which I filmed, clearly defined the correct date-although with timings that were a little out of kilter with the Condon report. Since the transmission of my program in April 1996, the quest to get to the bottom of the case has gone on in earnest. I spent some time in contact with Squadron Leader Freddie Wimbledon, who scrambled the Venoms that night and had accrued various documents about the matter. My colleagues, Dr David Clarke and Andy Roberts, tracked down the two pilots of the Venoms. Their stories mirrored the ones of the navigators very closely. The debate ensued as to whether another Venom was involved that had experienced the more dramatic intercept as de- scribed by Condon, and Dave and Andy garnered more data and interviews from other sources at the Ministry who recalled the date. I also filmed an interview (thankfully just before he died) with a senior MoD (Ministry of Defence) man who recalled the incident and believed he had seen gun cam- era footage taken of the \"blob\" witnessed by the crew of the Venom, although no such footage has been traced, and it remains unclear if this incident did truly relate to the Lakenheath-Bentwaters incident or some other event around the same time period. Dave, Andy, Martin Shough, and myself, with several others, engaged in an internet-based investigation, and the outcome of all this work is the web site that has now appeared. You can access it at: www.parcellular.fsnet.co.uk/Lakenheath.htm What it does is put down all the gathered data-inter- view transcripts, copies of documents, some of our dis- cussions on the events-and provides the person who ac- cesses the site just about everything that could currently be on the table about this case. It attempts to prove nothing (although some of those involved express their personal opinions). In essence it is a work in progress, and an attempt to do internet UFOlogy in a different way by revealing-almost raw-the investi- gation into a major case. It would be terrific if other big UFO incidents could each gain their own site that is set up purely to document all the evidence and allow the armchair UFO detective wonderful scope for investigation. It might kill off all hard copy UFO books, mind you. But that may well be a price worth paying.

According to the story, in June 1947 a number of UFOs were seen flying over the harbor at Puget Sound, Maury Island, by several people (including a man named Harold Dahl). One of the UFOs seemed to malfunction and dropped a sizeable amount of unidentified debris into the water below. The two key players in the case were Dahl and a man named Fred Crisman, who subsequently recovered the debris and passed it on to the military for examination. Intriguingly the military personnel transporting the.ma- terial for study were killed when their aircraft exploded. The debris was reportedly never recovered. The Majestic 12 1st Annual Report makes an illumi- nating reference to this incident: The death of two Air Force counterintelligence officers in the crash of their B- 25 aircraft enroute to Hamilton AFB, California, after in- terviewing two auxiliary CG men who reported six UFOs over Maury Island, Washington, in June 1947. CIC agent Crisman had spoken to Kenneth Arnold, who on 26 June 1947, had reported a flight of UFOs over Mt. Rainier, Washington, and filed his report after he had spoken to Captain Davidson and Lieutenant Brown. The material given to Davidson and Brown was believed to come from Maury Island, and may be celestial fragments containing metal from a nuclear reactor from a UFO. Fragments were turned over to CIA agent Shaw, and Crisman was ordered to the Alaskan ADC for assign- ment in Project IVY.

Grain handled unusual metal parts reportedly from a crashed flying saucer, took dictation from Werner Von Braun, was made aware of the details of three UFO crashes, and possessed a Top Secret Q clearance.

Friedman Stanton T. Friedman Young blood needed While writing last month's column on Dr. James E. McDonald, in my opinion the most outstanding ufologist ever, I couldn't help but think of how many leaders in the field are getting older and older, but without many new- comers to take their place. Ann Druffel, author of Firestorm: Dr. James E. McDonald's Fight for UFO Sci- ence, the excellent new book about Jim, was born in 1926. Dr. Jacques Vallee, who wrote the foreword to the book, was born in 1939. Dr. Richard Raines, who is still active in ufology and has collected several thousand pilot sightings and published several UFO books, was born in 1937. Dr. Bruce Maccabee, who has contributed so much to ufology over the years with regard to the government cover-up and con- cerning photo analysis of cases ranging from Gulf Breeze to McMinnville was born in 1942, as was Timothy Good of the UK. Dick Halll author of The UFO Evidence and a much updated version, was born in 1930. John Schuessler, In- ternational Director of MUFON, is still very active, but. was bom in 1933. Dr. Robert M. Wood, on the board of MUFON, FUFOR, and CUFOS, was born in 1925. Three top abduction researchers, Budd Hopkins, Dr. John Mack, and Dr. David Jacobs, were born in 1931,1929, and 1942 respectively. A few exceptions There are fortunately some exceptions. The most out- standing is John Greenewald Jr., author of Beyond UFO Secrecy and host of the outstanding Black Vault website (www.blackvault.com), who turns 22 this year. John gave a fine paper at the MUFON Conference in St. Louis in 2000 and at the Aztec Annual Conference in March of 2003. His site reflects an enormous amount of effort to obtain government UFO-related documents from many different sources . Another relatively young UFO researcher in the USA is Nick Redfern, now of Texas, who has written several books and also gave a fine paper in Aztec. He was born in the UK in 1964. Clearly, there is a need to attract young people to re- place those of us getting well past our prime. I was born in 1934. I used to chide Allen Hynek that he was the same age as my father (born in 1910). Now I am cer- tainly old enough to be John Greenewald's grandfather, as are many of the leading lights of American ufology. I don't even get too upset when I am called the grandfa- ther of Roswell, although it used to be the Father of Roswell. It has been more than 25 years. What can be done? Each of us can make an effort to attract younger people by speaking at high schools, community colleges, in class- rooms, as well as to wider audiences. When I speak at a college campus, I always offer to speak in classes. Fewer and fewer hosts make the effort to arrange such visits, even though there is no extra charge. I have been well received in the Honors Physics class at the local high school when I have spoken there. Make a habit of at least leaving free book lists and MUFON subscription blanks. We could each make up a bibliography of the best materials, some no longer gener- ally available, and offer to loan them to interested parties. Many students have to write essays and/or do term papers and other projects. I get frequent requests via the internet, but am sure I could do more to make people at schools aware of my availability. I am sure many of you could as well. I try to aim my campus presentations at general audi- ences, rather than at ufologists, even at MUFON Con- ferences. We could charge lower admission fees for younger people for our group meetings and try to attract the gen- eral public, especially younger people, without program- ming lectures or events that are too specialized for begin- ners. Some science fiction Star Trek type groups should be approached as well. We could point more interested young people towards the UFO Investigators Handbook and try to get inter- ested young people to do investigations with us. We can show people how to get more data from newspapers and magazines by using Readers Guide and the periodical files at the city and university libraries near us. Some need to be convinced that not everything is on the internet, yet. One recommendation I have made that seems to help is to get people to check local newspapers (usually on microfilm) for the period June 25 to July 15,1947. There were loads of front page headline stories about flying sau- cers, flying discs, even flying platters. Many people don't realize that even newswire stories are played differently in different papers, often with local relevant sightings added . The time period involved obviously includes Kenneth Arnold's June 24, 1947, case and the Roswell story. Al- though most libraries have the New York Times on micro- film, it didn't mention Roswell, because it was a morning paper, until July 9-after General Ramey's cover story had been issued. Page 18 MUFON UFO Journal June 2003"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"However, evening papers from Chicago west on July 8 had the original story before the cover-up. To date I have found only one July 8 newspaper, the Los Angeles Herald Express, which featured both the original story and the cover-up on the same front page. I bet there are others out there, such as on the west coast and in Hawaii. Digging into press reports It would be interesting to have young people, with guid- ance from older investigators, dig into how the press treated the USAF totally misleading press release of Oc- tober 25,1955, about the completion of Project Blue Book Special Report 14, which never mentioned the title of the report or where the work was done or who did it-and apparently without the press even asking these questions. The press treatment of the closing of Project Blue Book on Dec. 19,1969, is another event to be researched. In all these cases one finds some editorials as well as the news stories. The issuance of the Condon Report in January, 1969, brought forth loads of negativity, often seeming to be from people who hadn't read it. The issuance of the USAF \"Roswell Report: Truth Vs. Fiction in the New Mexico Desert\" (the USAF supplied the fiction) in 1995, and the equally misleading sequel \"The Roswell Report: Case Closed\" on June 24,1997, and the Roswell 50th anniver- sary celebration a week later, would be excellent topics for careful investigation by young ufologists. The front-page, grossly inadequate, article by a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist for the New York Times, William Broad, on Sunday, Sept. 18,1994, typifies the general bias, ignorance, and failure to do critical analysis of the false proclamations of the noisy negativists that are typical rather than unusual. Many high schools have clubs, some of which might be interested in having a free talk by a MUFON member about local sightings, about the big picture, about Star Travel, or government cover-up. There are campus sections of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, of the Institute for Elec- trical and Electronic Engineers, the American Physical Society, and the American Nuclear Society, all of whom need exciting programs. I, for one, would provide free copies of my videos \"Fly- ing Saucers Are Real\" (Vols. 1 and 2), \"UFOs ARE Real,\" and \"Recollections of Roswell\" for viewing by local clubs and groups to anybody who will show them publicly. Believe it or not, the Audio Visual Department of the Province of New Brunswick distributed copies of my \"UFOs ARE Real\" video to high schools, some of whom used it for their Maritime Studies course. Two different teachers told me it was the one class in which it was guaranteed that their students would pay attention! (New Brunswick is one of 3 Maritime Provinces). Get acquainted with local broadcasters One could get to know local broadcasters, especially at stations catering to young audiences, to offer to do a local talk show, or give them my number and that of other elder statesmen of Ufology who would be willing to do telephone interviews. I think an important way to lure young members would be to take a much more proactive approach, seeking sightings rather than waiting for them to come to you. Having a widely publicized toll free number is one ap- proach which can bring in reports. Another, once a sighting report has been received, is to send a letter to the local newspapers and radio stations, seeking reports, promising not to use names without per- mission. I have done this on several occasions and been given many more reports. Be sure to list phone, email and snail mail addresses. A toll free number helps (mine is 1- 877^57-0232). Displays in shopping malls offering special reduced subscription or membership rates and distributing a free information list, and good UFO pictures on display panels with appropriate captions would be doable. MUFON will observe National UFO Awareness Week from Aug. 16, through Aug. 23,2003, so this would be an especially good time to set up displays and programs, as Stan Gordon does each year in Pennsylvania. Donate subscriptions to libraries MUFON members could donate subscriptions for the MUFON UFO Journal to local public and campus li- braries. Jerome Clark's outstanding two-volume UFO Encyclopedia could also be donated to provide a factual data base for those young people with a serious interest. Many schools have science fairs. Offer to help stu- dents by providing source materials. Anybody who wants to distribute the 10-page bibliography in my \"TOP SE- CRET/MAJIC\" is welcome to do so. It includes 10 PhD theses and a bunch of negative books, as well as the ac- curate and comprehensive data sources that are avail- able but little known. I think an important part of attracting younger people to ufology in general, and MUFON in particular, would be for many of us to stop being apologist ufologists or closet ufologists. We need to take on the debunkers head on. That certainly means doing one's homework. In 36 years of lecturing (\"Flying Saucers ARE Real!\") I have had only 11 hecklers, of which two were drunk, even though many of my audiences were professional groups, as op- posed to just campus groups. The polls show a majority accept UFO reality, and the greater the education, the more likely to say some UFOs are alien spacecraft. I have yet to have an egg or tomato thrown at me. There was a two-hour TV debate on the ITV network in the UK in June, 1997, between Tim Good, Nick Pope, and myself vs. the con team of professors of physics, psychology, and astronomy. \"Have aliens visited Earth?\" 100,000 people called in to say yea or nay. 92% said YES! If we don't stand up for facts and data and truth, who will? Perhaps we could collectively produce a FAQ about UFOs so that younger people would recognize that we are with it?

A visual encounter with an entity Sighting date: November, 1988 Place: Minneapolis, MN Time: 6:15 a.m. Witness name: Sheila Andrade MUFON Investigator: William I. McNeff Number of entities: 1 Distance from witness: 8-10 ft. Description of encounter by witness [From notes taken during telephone interviews on 9-18-00 and 10-19-02, and written testimony from the witness in October, 2002-William I. McNeff] My experiences go back to July of 1988. It was at night. I heard a sound like thousands of blow torches. I couldn't move. [She was sleeping on the sofa on the porch at home.] I don't know how long it lasted; it seemed like forever; Then it cut off, and I ran to my parents' room. I called the police, and they informed me that they had just received a call from someone just a couple of blocks from me regarding an unusual sound. Another person I know who lives in the Camden area about a mile from the NSP generator plant, says they may have been letting off steam, but no way should I have heard it, since I live over 6 miles from the plant. I called NSP and they informed me that they only let off steam about every ten years, and they said no way could I have heard it from where I live. Three weeks later my parents were on the porch, around midnight. They apparently heard the same sound I had heard. My Dad wanted to go out, but the sound cut off suddenly. Entity experience In November [1988], my Dad was at a convention, and I slept with my Mom. The alarm clock went off, I popped up, sprung forward, then fell backwards. I couldn't move, couldn't do anything but think. I finally managed to move my foot, then my leg, then sat up on the edge of the bed. Things felt like they were out of sync, like a wave moving. [I got up], put my hand on the door, walked toward the bathroom, put my hand on the wall, looked to the right into the dining room, and saw this black figure [it was if it reflected no light at all]. Then I went into the bathroom. I got the toothpaste, started to brush my teeth, then thought about the figure. I peeked out of the bathroom, didn't see anything [in the dining room anymore]. The figure had been so black that I saw no features. There is lots of light in our house from street lights etc. The head was rounder than ours. It also seemed bigger, but not grossly. It was not my nephew [who was living with us at the time]; [he is] too tall. The black figure was about 4 feet 8 inches to 5 feet tall; it was a little shorter than my Mom, who is 5 feet 1-1/2 inches tall. A month later, [approx. December 1988], Dad was home, I had the same out-of-sync experience, with the wave thing. [I was starting into the bathroom]. Dad said to me, \"What are you doing? You just went into the bathroom half an hour ago!\" He said I was wearing a white nightgown. I didn't have a white night gown! Years later, my nephew told me of hearing about ab- ductions. [I hadn't heard of them.] Update My most recent experience was at the end of March this year (2000). Has anyone ever had the experience of coming back into their body? It felt like something being thrown at me; it bounced off my bed, into me. Our dog was still alive and jumped up, because she heard it. It felt like it hit my chest area, but it hit on the left [side of my bed] first. It was about early morning, I have it in my journal. Evaluation by investigator McNeff The experience that is the main subject of this report, the sighting of the entity, would fit the description of \"sleep paralysis\" to some degree. Certainly paralysis is vividly described by the witness. But initially, according to the witness, there was no paralysis; rather she briefly popped into a sitting position. In the typical description of sleep paralysis, hallucina- tions may be present. However, the sighting of the black entity, which might be supposed to be a hallucination, took place after the witness had gotten out of bed and walked some distance down a hallway to the doorway of the liv- ing room. The alarm had gone off at 6 AM, and this was the witness' normal time for arising on a work day, so it would be normal to be fairly awake in a minute or so. It could be assumed that she was fairly well awake at that point. It could be doubted that hallucinations would be experienced after a person is fairly awake. Contrari- wise, the account of having popped into a sitting position Page 20 MUFON UFO Journal June 2003"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"could be itself a hallucination. This investigator, however, is not certain how well the alleged phenomenon of \"sleep paralysis\" has been studied. It seems to be fairly well established that during sleep a chemical is generated in the human body which para- lyzes the large motor muscles, but not the heart or lung muscles. This paralysis lessens from time to time during the periods of lighter sleep to the degree that the sleeper is able to change his or her position in bed. In \"sleep paralysis\" an excess of the paralyzing chemical is supposed to have been produced. But this investigator wonders if many, or perhaps all, of the incidents of \"sleep paralysis\" are actually abduction incidents, in which the hallucinations\" are actually screen memories. It is suspected that this entity experience may have been part of an abduction experience. The best way to attempt to confirm or disprove this would probably be to conduct a regression. But this investigator is reluctant to urge this course on a person who seems to be generally unconcerned about the experience, and appears to be leading a happy, pro- ductive life, as is the witness. Only if the witness ex- presses a suspicion that more went on than is in con- scious memory, and states an urgent desire to find out, will I suggest, but not recommend, regression. Without regression, the uncertainties about this case must remain. But the other experiences recounted by the witness suggest that some strange things associated with her house, family, or neighborhood had been happening. The \"sound like thousands of blow torches\" was appar- ently heard by more than one witness on one or both oc- casions. The incidents of the \"white night gown\" and the \"com- ing back into the body,\" as well as the paralysis associ- ated with the roaring sound on one occasion and the en- tity sighting on another, are all strongly suggestive that abductions of this witness may have been occurring. The fact that she did not investigate the black figure initially may have been part of a \"control\" mechanism by an en- tity which had remained in the house just long enough to verify that she, or some other family member, was not adversely affected by an abduction. It is this investigator's conclusion that there is signifi- cant evidence, but no certainty, that a strange entity was seen, and that abductions of the witness may have been occurring. March Italian reports same as average The number of reports of sightings of UFO phenom- ena occurring in Italy during the month of March and collected by the Internet working group for the caselog of the Italian Center for UFO Studies (CISU) has totaled 27. This is a drop of fifty percent from February, bringing in the month of March at its usual average and the first quarter at the same levels of preceding years (with the exception of 2002, which was \"richer\" by 50%): with 177 cases. The quarter's reports were concentrated more than usual in the northern regions, which alone account for two-thirds of the total. Majestic 12 web site...

As an example, this 3-page document, titled Somaliland Presi- dent Egal Speaks on Mysterious Bomb Blast, dates from January 1996 and concerns a series of mysterious explo- sions that had occurred in the same month and year in the eastern part of Somaliland. The report (that originated with the CIA and that was forwarded to the State Department, Defense Intelligence Agency and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base among oth- ers) states that in some quarters the explosions had been attributed to UFOs. Interestingly, the document also states that the physical and mental health of both animals and people in the region had been adversely affected by what- ever it was that had exploded. The document states that the object that crashed or exploded was moving at supersonic speed but due to the size and remoteness of the area, a search for debris had been unsuccessful..

Earth continues to close in on our neighbor in space. Beginning July 19, the diameter of Mars exceeds 20 arc-seconds for a pe- riod of 11 weeks, a span of prime observation unequaled since the Mars opposition of 1924! The red planet now rises in the ESE about 10:45 in mid-month, and then proceeds westward during the night. (It appears to reverse its orbital motion, starting on the 30th, an illusion caused by a faster-moving Earth catch- ing up to a slower-moving outer planet.) On July 16 Mars rises only 2 degrees to the left of the gibbous Moon. See \"Morning Sky.\" Jupiter (magnitude -1.8), in Cancer, is very low in the WNW at dusk, setting about 1 1/2 hours after sunset. The big world lies below the lunar crescent on the 2nd. From about July 24 to 26, Jupiter appears within 1 1/2 degrees of tiny Mercury. The crescent Moon joins both planets on the 30th. Bright Planets (Morning): Venus (-3.9) rises about 4 AM and stays very low in the ENE before sunrise. The brilliant object, however, is visible only during early July. Mars advances to a point due S at mid-twilight. On July 17 the gibbous Moon passes very close to the bright- ening planet, even hiding it from South Florida after 4 AM for about half an hour. Saturn (0.1), in Gemini, emerges in the ENE about 4 AM during the latter half of the month. It lies near the lunar crescent on the 26th and 27th.

Schuessler MUFON International Director MUFON Storefront Location is Closed The MUFON archives are still open and active after being relocated to the home of Bob and Lin Simpson in Parker, CO. Administrative functions continue seamlessly after being moved to the home of John and Kathy Schuessler in Littleton, CO. Contact information is unchanged. The mailing address is still MUFON, Post Office Box 369. Morrison. CO 80465-0369. The telephone (303-932-7709), FAX (303- 932-9279) and email (mufonhq@aol.com) remain the same as before the storefront was closed. The MUFON storefront lo- cation at 10143 West Chatfield Ave., Littleton, CO, was per- manently closed on Saturday, May 17, 2003. This was a di- rected action by the MUFON Business Board of Directors (described in the April 2003 is- sue of the MUFON UFO Journal) because that location was not paying its own way. It was a difficult decision, but John Schuessler a necessary one. We salute the MUFON volunteers who made this move so successful and relatively painless. National UFO Awareness Week MUFON will observe National UFO Awareness Week from Aug. 16, through Aug. 23, 2003. We hope to build on the successes of the 2002 event and expand the num- ber of activities held this year. State and local groups and individuals are urged to mount an aggressive public awareness campaign by placing dis- plays in local shopping centers and libraries, providing materials for radio and television stations and newspa- pers, speaking before public and private groups and soci- eties, and a whole variety of new activities. New Lifetime Members It is a pleasure to announce that Dr. Barry Downing, Endwell, NY; Robert A. Ede, Tracy, CA; and Dr. Rob- ert Hieronimus, Owings Mills, MD, are MUFON's lat- est lifetime members. We are extremely grateful for this vote of confidence and outstanding level of support.
