POSTMASTER: Send form 3579 to advise change of address to The MUFON UFO JOURNAL, 103 Oldtowne Rd., Seguin, Texas 78155. 1 FROM THE EDITOR An understanding of the six factors of UFO investigation should help promote more thorough and objective research: (1) the investigator's experience and skill; (2) the sighting report (interviewing, documenting, cross-checking); (3) witness credibility (additional witnesses, human psychology, tests); (4) analysis of physical or instrumented data; (5) the case report (summarizing all . the evidence); and (6) interpretation. Investigators will bring to bear more or less experience and skills. Their abilities and objectivity will determine the usefulness of a report. Obviously, there is a need for accuracy and thoroughness. First, the details of a sighting must be elicited from a witness, documented, checked, and converted into a written or tape- recorded report. This document then becomes a working paper. Whether or not the initial report includes some personal character information, witness credibility should be continually investigated through whatever tools are available (polygraph, PSE, character study), especially in controversial or \"high strangeness\" cases. In physical effect or photographic cases, appropriate tests or analyses need to be conducted. Ideally, all relevant information then should be summarized in a case report that becomes one more datum among thousands, subject to critique by all interested parties as a check against errors or inconsistencies. Interpretation of any single case as supporting or disconfirming a given theory is not likely to be meaningful and should be avoided. Since we still are in the primitive stages of trying to gather and analyze data, I would go further and suggest that any \"theory\" at this juncture is merely someone's personal hunch or guess. For any theory to have merit, it must be based on carefully validated evidence. The larger a body of thoroughly investigated case reports we are able to compile, the more likely it is that we will begin to obtain some final answers.

Tucker (MUFON State Director for Indiana) It was Wednesday night, between 9:30 and 9:45 PM, on March 29, 1978. The location was one mile from highway 465 on 1-70 East, on the freeway bypass, Indianapolis, Indiana. .The sky was clear. It is a very busy highway. There were two 18-wheeler semi-trucks in a caravan, along with one Ford super-cab 1978 truck. The trucks were running 58 miles per hour on the freeway. The three men were talking back and forth on their CB's watching for patrol cars. All at once, like someone turned on a giant light bulb, a bright blue light covered the three vehicles. They were not able to see out beyond the hood of their trucks. Everything went quiet — all noise, all sounds seemed to stop. The trucks sputtered as if the motors were stopping. (This happened for an estimated 3 to 5 seconds.) Then, like a light bulb, it was turned off. CB's began to work, and the road noise became normal. Once again the motors were running smoothly. • The three drivers on the CB's couldn't believe what had happened. The driver of the rear truck (CB \"handle\" in MUFON files) shouted out on the CB, \"Hey, UFO, if you have your ears on, I want to go with you.\" And then almost as suddenly as before the strange bright blue light came down over the trucks like a lampshade again. Again they could not see out, nor see the trucks in back. (This time it was estimated that the strange big blue light lasted about 15 seconds.) The trucks were pulled down to 5 to 10 miles per hour, jerking and jumping. Again while in this bath of blue light the three drivers said they felt like there was no one else in the world. Everything was restful and quiet. They felt almost as if they were in limbo, everything in invisible blue. One of the witnesses stated, \"It is the most peaceful state I have ever experienced. I did not believe in this crazy stuff before, but I certainly do now. I drive about 130;000 miles a year, pulling trailers for Mewmar Industries in Nappanee, Indiana. I do not drink, nor use any drugs, and I have never experienced anything like this in my life. Every time I go by this place in Indianapolis I feel as though it could happen again.\" When asked by Charles Tucker, the interviewer, how did it affect your mind?, he said \"I think about it constantly, knowing it could happen to me again.\" As I continued the interview, I asked him if he noticed any physical effects on his truck or the other trucks. \"My clock is now losing about an hour a day, \" he said, \"and before this incident my clock worked just fine.\" He also stated, \" It took the battery about l'/ 2 hours to regain full charge.\" When asked if he could furnish names of the other drivers, he said he only met the drivers in the caravan, although the man in the rear was known by his CB handle as \"If I ever meet the others again | will give you the names and addresses,\" he said. \"But at the time I was too scared and never thought about getting the names and addresses of the men.\" After these two experiences, the CB's were full of excited people asking what had happened. (The witnesses are estimated to be over 100 people, consisting of 50 cars stopped across the freeway to view the phenomenon.) An . older woman from across the highway said on the CB, \"It looked like a big bright blue lamp shade over the three trucks.\" All the observers said they could not see the three trucks and that the light was only on the three trucks. There was no UFO visible, only a long spout estimated at 25 feet long. ~ The light came from the bottom. The blue light was approximately 250-300 feet in length. CORRECTION John Lutz, Baltimore, Maryland, has submitted the following information correcting an error and supplementing the data in \"UFO Windows and Magnetic Faults\" (No. 122, January 1978): In the table of magnetic disturbance areas, the Chesapeake Bay entry should read \"MD\" (for Maryland). Delaware (DE) does not adjoin the Bay. John, a representative for the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS), also points out that during the 1972-77 period indicated on the sighting density map, he submitted 272 cases to CUFOS, about 63 of which appeared to be unexplainable. Whether the cases were evaluated differently by CUFOS is not known. During 1977 alone, John processed 63 UFO reports, an average of about one per week. He has offered to make some of the better cases available to MUFON for publication."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"TELEPORTATION OF A CAR IN BRABANT (BELGIUM) By Emfle Techeur and Jean-Luc Vertongen (Edited from the September, 1977 SOBERS News Bulletin, ([1] No. 11,— by Ann Druffel) Although the event to be described occurred almost 13 years ago, the content and subsequent information received from the witness make it of exceptional interest to UFOlogists. In 1973, SOBERS became aware of the incident through a communication from Mr Ph. Ressos. We set about making an inquiry. The incident occurred on a small secondary county road which links the communities of Hoeilaart and Rixensart in Belgium. This.road passes through Malaise (Maleizen) and Rosieres about fifteen kilometers (9.3 miles) southeast of Bruxelles. Mrs. A. V. (name withheld on request) was driving this road about 7:30 or 8:00 PM. Dusk was falling, but Mrs. A. V. knew the route well, being accustomed to driving it twice daily to and from her work in Bruxelles. The date was September 1965. Mrs. A. V. was alone in her MG sports car, traveling about 90 kilometers per hour (56 mph). Her headlights were on, but her radio was not. Her husband was following about 500 meters behind her (1/3 mile) in his own car, because they had left Bruxelles together. Traffic was extremely light, and the lack of curves made the driving easy. To the left, when the configuration of the ground allowed it, the track of the Autoroute to the Ardennes was visible about a kilometer away, and the imposing radio transmission towers of Wavre could be seen in the distance. Cutlivated fields, orchards, pastures, and an occasional picturesque dwelling lined the route. Mrs. A. V. reached a low hill at the linguistic frontier of Belgium near Overijse and Rosieres.. Here, where the ancient Chateau of the Princes of Merode at Rixensart stands, was a curve in the road, alongside the \"Woo Field,\" the agricultural holdings of the chateau. As Mrs. A. V. reached the bend in the road, she. suddenly had the sensation that the car was not responding to the steering wheel, which turned from left to right for no apparent reason. She immediately thought of a flat tire or a tire rapidly losing air. She started to slow down. It was then that, bizarrely, she felt herself lifted in her car some centimeters off the ground. At the same time, a'\"small neon light\" appeared several centimeters from her windshield and remained there for a few . seconds, slightly to her right. The light seemed solid, opaque, and uniformly luminous, but not dazzling to the eye. Its color was light yellow. Its shape was that of a tube about 4 centimeters (1% inches) in diameter and about 70 centimeters long (27 inches). It was slightly curved toward the top. Its ends were well defined and its contours clear. Mrs. A. V. was stupefied. The wheel no longer wobbled, and the entire car felt as though she were driving on a cushion of air without Mrs. A. V. controlling it in any way. She remembers seeing some dust airborne on her left hand side about a meter from the ground, but could not remember exactly at what moment this phenomenon was produced. The light stayed fixed near the windshield for what seemed to the witness an interminable time, though in reality it was only 3 or 4 seconds. Then it suddenly disappeared. With the light's disappearance the car once again made contact with the ground. Mrs. A. V. had traveled 50 meters (51 yards) along the road, but could not explain how. Back on the road again she regained full control of the car. Although very frightened, she continued on her way, trying to see whether there was anything or anybody above, at the side of, or behind her. She saw nothing unusual, and the car responded perfectly, At no time did the engine behave irregularly, even during the levitation. Badly shaken, Mrs. A. V. hurried home as fast as she could. She arrived home excited and pale, and her husband arrived home moments later. He asked her whether she felt alright, but her nervous tension as well as fear of ridicule prevented her from telling her story immediately. It was not until 3 days later that she was able to relate her adventure. Her husband had seen nothing unusual during the journey, but it is possible he was too far behind Mrs. A. V.'s MG. A few hours after the incident, Mrs. A. V. noticed on the outside of her wrists, marks similar to a thick line, about two fingers wide. These marks seemed composed of a multitude of small points very close together, each about the size of a pinhead and red, blue, and black in color. The mark on her left wrist was especially noticeable. This mark, generally a reddish color, was sharp in'outline and itched like a light burn. It appeared suddenly and disappeared 1 week later. Mrs. A. V. was not unduly alarmed and did not consult a doctor. Two years later, in 1967, this mark was again visible in the same location and later disappeared as previously. Since that time, there has been no recurrence of this phenomenon."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Verifications The rapidity of the levitation incident and the shock its witness felt prevents her from remembering with precision her conduct and sensations at the time she regained control of her vehicle. This is completely understandable. Nevertheless, the salient points of the actual levitation are clear in her mind. We do not doubt for one moment the veracity of her statements. At the time of our inquiries, Mrs. A. V. unburdened herself, telling the story in detail for the first time. It was evident that she felt a great feeling of relief in doing so. In subsequent conversations with us, no contradictions were evident in her testimony.  . . As far as proof is concerned, unfortunately the only traces were the marks on her wrists, and they are no longer present for anlaysis. The car was sold several years ago, and it .is, naturally, hopeless to try to find any evidence on the site of the event after so long a time. However, we did accompany Mrs. A. V. to the scene of the sighting where she related her experience on the site. According to Mrs. A. V., she noticed no change in her behavior or health, and apart from normal aging she carries no effect from the incident. Returning to the marks which appeared on her wrists — on the evening in question, Mrs. A. V. remembered that she was wearing a dress with long sleeves, which left only her wrists uncovered. Inquiry brought out that she was driving the car with her hands resting in a four o'clock and eight o'clock position. The \"neon\" tube-line object was placed halfway up the windshield at about the center of the car, and it is quite likely that it produced a radiation effect on the wrists. Logically, it would seem that the left wrist should suffer more than the right, in view of its position vis-a-vis the \"neon\". Such proved to be the case. As far as the apparition of the \"neon\" and the levitation of the car are concerned, the witness states that they lasted 4 seconds at a maximum. At a speed of 90 km/hr, the car would have covered a distance somewhat less than 100 meters, which brings us to the edge of Woo Farm as indicated by the witness' testimony. An attempt at explanation At this stage of the inquiry, one can only pose a multitude of questions regarding the reality of the phenomenon observed. If we omit the traces of \"burns\" on the wrists, which may have had nothing directly to do with the observation, but rather were the result of the witness' shocked state, we are left with no physical proof that a UFO could have produced the effects described. However, we are not able to doubt the good faith of the witness. In reviewing the conditions of the sighting, we might hope to find a clue leading to a rational solution of the problem. Meteorological conditions were normal for autumn. The weather w,as dry and the sky clear. Visibility was good. Witness' personal condition: Mrs. . A. V. was not wearing spectacles and had no trouble with her eyes. She had np problem relating to the drive. She knew the route well, was relaxed and calm,. and had never before noticed anything unusual at this location. Existing public lighting:* Though the public lighting in this area is not troublesome or inconvenient, the thought immediately springs to mind, \"What if the public lighting had produced an intensive glare in the car's windshield? This is not likely for a number of reasons: 1. If the vehicle was moving, the fixed lights would produce a moving reflection on the windshield. 2. The duration of such a reflection on a curve would hardly last one second. 3. The outline of such a reflection would not be well-defined. 4. A reflection had never been noticed at this site before or since. Even considering that a momentary light and reflection had produced the \"neon,\" how does one explain the sensation of \"moving on a cushion of air,\" and the panic lasting several seconds to the point of losing complete control of the car? That seems most unlikely. On the site, nothing provides any supplementary clues. If one admits the authenticity of this case, the phenomenon cannot be explained in a simple, rational manner. There remains the possibility of a UFO. A small material machine — seen by the witness as a \"neon\" tube-shaped object — might have provoked the physical manifestations on the witness and altered the behavior of the car. Thus we have an extra report to provide clues to the statistician. However, in this case there are further details which bring it out of the usual pattern of such cases. It proves to be rather more than a \"simple\" case of interaction between UFO and witness. Did the phenomenon show a more direct link with Mrs. A. V., which could be the psychic \"catalyzer\" of the manifestation, or even subconsciously induce it? Before proceeding to this delicate problem — that of the parapsychol- ogical nature of certain manifestations classified as UFOs — it is necessary for the readers to familiarize themselves with the personality of the witness. Mrs. A. V. is a calm, composed person who has cooperated wholeheartedly with our inquiry, desiring only to remain anonymous for professional reasons. Active socially, she also assumes the responsibility of a very busy professional. She has three daughters and leads a normal family life. Before the September 1965 observation, Mrs. A. V. had never attached the slightest importance to the UFO phenomenon, apart from reading an occasional press article. Even since her experience, her attitude has not changed. The event had been completely forgotten until one (Continued on next page) *We presume that this Belgian phrase means the equivalent of American \"street lights\"."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"(Belgium, Continued) day another incident occurred, as bizarre and unbelievable as the preceding one. A few years ago, Mrs. A. V. was worried about the health of her second daughter who, though not seriously ill, was experiencing a troublesome and undiagnosable illness. Despite numerous measures taken by doctors and specialists, nothing seemed to give the expected results. This state of things continued for some time. One morning upon awakening, Mrs A. V. immediately had the feeling that there was someone in her bedroom. She opened her eyes and saw her second daughter (adolescent) facing her, standing at the head of the bed. The girl was fixed and immobile. This daughter at the time was absent from home and Mrs. A. V. realized the absurdity of the situation. At first she thought she was having a bad dream or hallucination. Suddenly, however, a small yellow \"neon\" appeared near her daughter. It seemed to assume the shape of her stomach and digestive system and remained stationary in this position for several seconds. Then the entire vision disappeared. Many questions came into Mrs. A. V.'s mind. Why again the \"neon\" and why the vision of her daughter? What was the significance of the phenomenon? Why was she, once again, a witness to this incredible manifestation? In Mrs. A. V.'s opinion, the vision could only be explained as a sign sent by a supernatural source, with an aim of clearing up her daughter's illness. She must be suffering from stomach trouble or upsets in the digestive system, and the doctors had not diagnosed this. Mrs. A. V.'s analysis turned out to be correct and, given subsequent adequate treatment, the young girl completely and quickly recovered. The vision of the \"neon\".was seen no more, and no other related phenomena occurred. From that time forward, Mrs. A. V. became interested in parapsychology. She declared, \"Actually I don't\" know why but I feel attracted . . by all that touches on the paranormal aptitudes of certain people. All my leisure time is spent on the study of these phenomena, although I have never before felt the slightest interest in this subject. I believe that I possess a gift for this sort of thing, especially for healing. I hope to develop this aptitude if I can.\" Recently, other \"bizarre\" phenomena have taken place which are personal to the witness and add nothing to the present subject at hand. Complementary information The adventure experienced by Mrs. A. V. remains a unique case in Belgium. However, we find two similar Canadian cases which were the object of an article published in our Revue under the title, \"Flying Vehicles br Hypnotized Drivers?\" [2] To briefly review these cases, the first one occurred on 18th February 1969, in Craigmyle, Province of Alberta. [3] Mrs. Barbara Smythe, a teacher, while traveling to school in a car saw a brilliant, reddish-rose colored machine on a hill. It was about 15 meters (16 yds.) in diameter, revolving slowly and showing two enormous white lights. The witness was traveling slowly. Suddenly the machine changed position, and the witness felt her car \"floating\" noiselessly and smoothly, as if she were hypnotized. The sensation lasted about 3 minutes during which the car traveled for a mile. After the object disappeared, everything became normal. There were no physical traces of the adventure. The second case occurred 24th May 1971 on the reserve of the Blackfoot Indians, Alberta. Mr. and Mrs. Raw Eater were returning home by car at the speed of 70 km/hr (43 mph) over a bumpy, poorly paved road. Suddenly a brilliant light cut through the night sky, striking the right-hand side of their car. Within a few seconds Mrs. Raw Eater cried out, \"The car has left the ground!\" The speedometer remained at 70 kmh as the car floated smoothly above the road at an estimated 60 centimeters (two feet). The car continued thus for 400 meters (1/4 mile), making contact again with the road the moment the strange light went away. There were no physical traces of the adventure. Commentary Together, the A. V., Smythe, and Raw Eater cases make three of a kind! Table 1, below, gives a resume of the common points between the Raw Eater case and the case v/ith which we are involved. As can be seen from the table, the analogy which exists between these two cases is too strange to be coincidental. On the Malaise secondary road, a small luminous object caused a driver to lose control of her vehicle and the car left the ground completely. Nevertheless, the car followed the curve of the road, and its motor continued to function both during and after the incident. Decidedly, we are far from the classic manifestations of UFOs with their perturbations on witnesses, the stopping of car engines, marks on grounds, etc. In addition, a physical impossibility exists here. How can one reasonably assume that the car, traveling about 90 km/hr, could negotiate a bend in the road while its wheels were not in contact with the ground and while it had no exterior support? Estimating the mass of the A. V. vehicle to be one thousand kilograms (2,205 Ibs) and the radius of curvature fifty meters (55 yds), the enormous centrifugal force which was operating at this moment was on the order of 12,500 newtons (i.e., 1,274 kilograms/force [4]:) Must we think that Mrs. A. V. dreamed her experience, or that she invented this fantastic story? The good faith of the witness is above all suspicion, and her adventure is not unique as we have been able to show. But how can we reconcile such inconceivable physical events within"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"the terms of our science? We will try another line of argument and try to reconcile both of Mrs. A.V.'s adventures — that is, the car levitation and the later appearance of the \"neon\" in her bedroom. In both incidents, the same type of object appeared — a luminous yellow \"neon\" which appeared and disappeared suddenly, directly acting upon the witness' psyche which interpreted the events as \"real\". And were they not, in the final analysis, real for her? Here we are confronted with the problem of the paranormal domain and with that of the \"psi\" facilities of certain people who seem able to capture extrasensory perceptions or, at times, exercise a direct effect on matter. This psychokinetic ability is usually involuntary and seems to occur during favorable states of mind. By \"favorable\" is meant either a relaxed state of consciousness or within a seriously mind-troubling period. There remains also the problem of the marks on Mrs. A.V.'s wrists. [5] We find ourselves at the frontier, not yet clearly delineated, between two newly-born branches of research — UFOlogy and parapsychology. The A.V. incident illustrates the seeming connection between the two domains. Mrs. A. V.'s car levitation can be classed as a UFO manifestation, and the vision in her bedroom falls within the domain of parapsychology and the study of the mental faculties of the witness. Until now we have assumed that the UFO phenomenon induces a direct action on the environment or on the witness, in a manner which is either physiologic or psychic. But could we not consider the phenomenon inversely: the witness, in a state of favorable consciousness would induce the described mani/esrafi'ons which could, in some cases, take on the aspect of a UFO phenomenon? In reality, it is not with the phenomenon itself that we should linger, but with the srudy of the witnesses themselves. That, unfortunately, does not fall within the bounds of a conventional inquiry.

The creatures had green faces and squinting eyes, and membranes between their fingers. They walked in a gently jumping way (bouncing or bobbing?--Ed.). They made inarticulate vocal sounds. Their faces had protruding cheekbones. Rectangular traces were found in the muddy road. In addition to the 71- year-old farmer, two children and two policemen saw the creatures. The creatures forced the farmer to enter their vehicle, which was situated hot far away hovering just above the ground. He entered the vehicle and was examined with an X-ray like apparatus. The creatures offered him what appeared to be transparent food, but he refused it. His stay on-board the bus- like vehicle (resembling a bus both because of its shape and dimensions) was not long, and then they let him go. On returning to the village, the farmer told everybody about his experience. Others in the village also saw the object, and heard a loud noise as it disappeared in the sky. I shall try to get more details and prepare an article for the Journal. The encounter was just 60 km from Lublin. I have learned that psychiatrists and other specialists have carried out interviews with the witnesses, and are of-the opinion that the reports of the farmer and the children are valid and corroborate each other in all details. (Editorial Note: Basic details of this report were carried on the newswires by Agence France Presse on June 5, 1978, from Warsaw, Poland.) TRUCK DRIVER PACED IN DESERT (From UFO Research of South Australia Newsletter, No. 30, March-April 1978) A truck driver from Adelaide reported an interesting observation to us which occurred on the 5th March 1978. As he provided a graphic description of his experience we will relate it in his own words. The time was 2AM. \"I was travelling south from Leigh Creek toward Hawker. I had a blowout just before Parachilna and while I was changing the wheel I had a feeling that something or somebody was nearby watching me. I had a good look around and as I could not see or hear.anything I finished changing the tire. I climbed in the cabin of my truck, had a cup of coffee and a cigarette, and I started off again. \"About 2-3 minutes later I noticed a bluish green light ahead, 6-8 feet above the road. I did not take any notice of it because the railway line was on my left-hand side and I thought it was a 8 reflecting sign. It then started to move slowly up and down about 2-3 feet. As I didn't know what it was I had put high beam on to have a look, but before the beam could hit it, two smaller red lights appeared under the green (one on each side) light and it took off about 45° to the right, so quickly that I could only see a small flash and it disappeared. \"About 30 seconds later it came back again, about 15-20 feet above the road. I could then only see the green light. It started to lower itself towards the road, and when it was about 5 feet, off the ground I switched on to high beam. Again, before the beam hit it, the two red lights came on and it shot up into the air at great speed. It came back very soon afterwards but would not come below 20 feet above the road and it always kept 150-200 feet ahead of me regardless of what speed I was travelling. I had tried time after time to catch it but the result was always the same. This went on for at least 15 minutes. \"A semi-trailer was coming up from behind me so I stopped, turned off my headlights, arid while I was watching for the semi to come closer the green light was still there ahead of me. I stopped the driver and the semi-trailer pulled up about 100 feet in front of me, so I drove my truck alongside. I took my time getting out and walking about 10 feet across the road to the semi and at the same time kept my eye on the green light. When I climbed up into his cabin and looked through the windscreen, it had gone. After he left I waited for about 10-15 minutes but the light did not appear again so I started out myself... nothing more happened.\" Investigations are continuing."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST CIA By Richard Hall In 1976 MUFON established six Information Centers in Europe, Africa, and Asia, to encourage international exchange of UFO data.

Blake (Department of Sociology Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University) The basic data of ufology is the UFO report (Michel, 1958; Hynek, 1972). Most UFO reports are of incredible events. Many are misidentifications. Close encounters seem to be the most incredible and the least likely to be misidentifications. Since they are so incredible, we require stringent evidence. Hynek's emphasis on the importance of multiple witnesses follows from this difficulty. On a scale of 0 to 10, he says that he will not \"assign a Probability Rating greater than 3 to any report coming from a single reporter, and then only when it is established that he has a very solid reputation\" (1972:26). On this basis most close encounter reports would have to be assigned a very low probability of occurrence. Table 1 summarizes data on close encounters from Vallee (1969), Webb (1976), and Bloecher (1975). The original number of cases from Vallee was reduced from 923 to 869 by beginning with Case No. 55 (June 10, 1947). This was reduced further by eliminating seventy-one cases that provided no information about witnesses, leaving 798 cases for analysis. Webb provides 75 cases and Bloecher provides 37 cases. The majority. of close encounter reports indicate a single witness (51.9%, 65.3%, and 70.3%). A substantial proportion of the remainder involve either two witnesses or members of a family unit (22.6%, 24.0% and 24.3%). Multiple witness cases account for 22.0% of the Vallee sample, 8.0% of the Webb sample, and 5.4% of the Bloecher sample. An additional point to note for the Vallee set is that the data are poor. The composition of the group and number of witnesses \"were frequently unspecified, as were the actual number of witnesses within the group in some cases. Some of these 175 cases 10 involved clear authority figures: employers (6 cases), school teachers (3), and policemen (many, but not counted). What are usually taken to be the besf cases, those involving multiple independent witnesses, accounted for only a tiny proportion of the total (3.5%, 2.7% and 0.0%), and, frankly, some of them sounded suspiciously like either hoax or a combination of error and altered state of consciousness.' Unless a multiple witness sighting involves independent witnesses it is a social situation. Many '. of the-close encounters were social situations (44:6%, '32.0%, and 29.7%). This should not be passed over as glibly as some researchers do with snide references to the unlikelihood of \"hallucination,\" \"delusion,\" or \"hysteria,\" as though these were the only factors to consider. The fact that most multiple witness sightings are social situations deserves as much attention as the contents of the report, since social factors can influence those contents. We will examine this problem by focusing on folie a deux and conformity. folie a deux We must seriously consider the possibility of folie a deux (literally \"madness of two\" or shared madness). We need not assume witnesses to be \"mad.\" Schwarz (1968) informs us that he has never found any psychiatric patients who speak of UFOs, nor have the few close encounter witnesses he has tested demonstrated psychiatric tendencies. While this is valuable information it may divert us from the fact that surprisingly high proportions of the American population report having had experienced wide awake spontaneous altered states of consciousness (ASC) at least once in their lifetimes (see, e.g., Bourque, 1969; Greeley, 1975; Shor, 1960). An altered state of consciousness or emotionally stirring but ambiguous stimulus may be interpreted by the dominant member of a group in such a way as to mimic the effects of folie a deux. We should be aware of the conditions under which this may occur. Gruenberg (1957) offers a thorough, if dated, review of the literature. He suggests that we recognize this strange state as a group phenomenon rather than focus wholly on issues of individual pathology or abnormality. The means of assigning truth-value to 'our perceptions (avoiding \"delusions\") is through reality-testing; one of the most important means of reality-testing is through consensual validation — comparing our perceptions to those of others. If the perceptions of others are \"delusions\" or filtered through an altered state of consciousness, then reality-testing may be impaired. As Gruenberg (1957:214) puts it, \"if one is dependent on a psychotic person for consensual discrimination of one's fantasies from reality, and if his delusions correspond with one's fantasies, one is likely to have difficulty making the distinction or even is likely to make the wrong choice.\" Again, we must emphasize that folie a deux need not involve FOOTNOTE 1. These were, for the Vallee sample, numbers 60, 151, ISO, 204, 234, 259, 284, 317, 330, 357, 366, 384, 393, 394, 495, 513, 547, 585, 622, 635, 664, 676, 710, 713, 761, 777, 791, 810. For the Webb sample, they were numbers 48 and 33,34,35 (which were counted as a single episode). In some of these cases we may question whether independent witnesses were observing the same phenomenon, since many involve some people reporting a light or object in the sky as one or two others report a landing (with or without occupants). Timing of such reports is obviously crucial, since the former could trigger the latter."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"\"madness.\" Pulver (1963), in fact, suggests that dynamics similar to those in /o/ie a deux occasionally occur between an. analyst and patient, especially when hypnosis is used. Fischer (1975:223) even refers to \"being in love\" as \"classic folie a deux\"! Whether a person is psychotic or has simply experienced some transient form of ASC probably matters little, if that person has in his company one or more others whose fantasies are validated by his \"delusion. \"Gruenberg, citing Gralnick, lists conditions under which folie a deux can appear. These include a dominance-submission relationship between or among the parties, family relationship, a prer psychotic personality, sex and age. Of 118 combinations of .people (representing 103 episodes) studied by Gralnick (Gruenberg, 1957:217), 109 involved members of the same family; in 83 of these 109 combinations a woman was the dominant party, in 26 a man was the .dominant party. Those cases involving women usually consist of sisters or a mother-daughter relationship. We should also note that younger people are likely to be recipients from older. conformity The discussion of folie a deux suggests caution when investigating certain multiple witness reports, particularly those involving members of the same family. Other multiple witness reports need to be investigated with caution as well. Processes of conformity may determine the report (see, e.g., Krech, Crutchfield, and Ballachey, 1962; Tedeschi and Linkskold, 1976; and Wrightsman, 1977, for discussions). Conformity is here taken to mean \"yielding to,group pressures\" (Krech, Crutchfield, and Ballachey, 1962:506). The fact is that, \"substantial amounts .of yielding are produced by group pressure, and this is true despite the fact that the bogus group consensus to which the person conforms may be manifestly wrong\" (Krech, Crutchfield, and Ballachey, 1962:509). In reported experiments proportions ranging up to 46% of the particular, samples yielded to group pressures. It is important to note that many people can be pressured into yielding (conforming) even on items of personal importance to them; it should be no great surprise to expect a greater likelihood of conformity about things of small personal importance. Finally, as long ago as 1937 Sherif. (Sherif and Sherif, 1956:551-554) had .discovered that the judgments of individual group members tended to converge when judging ambiguous-stimuli. According to Sherif and Sherif (1956:134): \"When the stimulus situation lacks objective structure, the effect of others' judgments is .:. pronounced .... In one ... study of , social 'factors- in perception utilizing the autokinetic phenomenon, an individual judged distances of apparent movement first alone and then with two or three other subjects. This unstructured situation' arouses considerable uncertainty. Even though they were not told to agree and were cautioned against being influenced, the individuals, in togetherness situations shifted their judgments toward a common standard or norm of judgment.... The influence of various individuals differed, and the emerging common norm for judgment was in various instances above or below the average of individual judgments in the initial session alone. In such a situation, a dominant person may shape consensus. People are much more likely to yield to group pressures on items about which they know, little. They are also likely to yield if no public commitment has been made to a contrasting position (e.g., if a known UFO skeptic or believer is in the group, his previous (continued on next, page) Table 1. — Number and Relationship of Witnesses in Close Encounter Reports.

Personal factors include past experience as a yielder, sex role (women are more likely to conform than men), and personality. Conformists, or yielders, tend to be less intelligent than independents, \"lower in 'ego-strength' and an ability to cope under stress ... tend to exhibit emotional constriction, lack of spontaneity/repression of impulse, and indirect expression of hostility ... tend to be more anxious\" (Krech, Crutchfield, and Ballachey, 1962:526). They are also more likely to lack self- confidence*, to be concerned with what other people will think about them, and to have a low tolerance of ambiguity. There are situational factors that are relevant. Group composition may be most important. A person is likely to yield to those perceived as being competent, to those of higher status, or to members of a group to which he or she aspires to membership. It is also worth nothing that the most conforming person is likely to be the member having second-highest status within a group. Group size and alignment is also relevant to conformity, to the extent that there may be group discussion of an ambiguous stimulus with initial disagreement (say, for example, be/ore an investigator arrives). If only one person within the group opposes a position there is very little yielding to that person; if two people oppose there is some yielding and if either three or four oppose there is maximum yielding. However, yielding becomes less likely if even one other person supports the potential yielder. A final factor influencing yielding in groups of any size is the potential that group members have of applying coercion or sanction to the deviant member. This may be especially important in family groups. How pervasive and extensive is the \"yielding effect'? Although some of the effect (i.e., some conformity) is maintained over time, most is not. This may vary by the way in which a person initially deals with judgmental discrepancies or disagreement within the group. There are at least five possibilities: 1. the individual comes to believe that his own judgment is in error, explains away that error, and conforms; 2. the individual comes to the con- clusion that the group's judg- ment is in error and resists; 3. the individual tries to reconcile the differences by claiming there are none, that both sides are correct; he compromises; 4. the individual simply accepts that differences will occur; 5. the individual may avoid the problem by avoiding evidence of discrepancy (e.g., he will not hear opposing statements). The first position is the \"true conformist,\" the second, the independent, and the last three are expedient conformists. The independent is, of course, most likely to provide the investigator with a dissenting view if he is still around. He will be the target of much interaction (Schachter, 1951) and may decide to leave. Whether an expedient conformist will provide dissenting information at any time is probably a function of both his own attachment to the group and the initial degree of publicly stated support for the account offered by his group. some suggestions From one point of view the social dynamics of a UFO report represent a source of error. From this point of view one ought to be aware of the importance of structured relationships based either on moral authority or fear of sanction. Family groups are most suspect since they involve both.

Schucsslcr UFO investigators, critics, and believers alike too often accept or reject cases based on too little real data. During this past year I have noted a number of cases where investigators have rushed to give an explanation for certain sightings; the usual planet, balloon, or helicopter variety, where the investigator used the data at hand but never entered the field. To do this they chose to let their experience override facts. The witnesses may have patiently told the investigator that Venus was visible at the same time, or that the balloon in. question wasn't launched until several hours later; nevertheless, the case was safely listed as an IFO. Nobody gains from all this, but science does suffer. If we are to ever find a responsible set of explanations for the UFO enigma we must drop the excuses for not thinking creatively or scientifically and try to never pass up the potential for paydirt. Specialists often have trouble keeping up with advances in their own > fields and are often totally out of phase with changes in the state-of-the-art in other fields. It is not necessary to have an \"Answer\" for every. UFO that is reported; but it is important to get involved in observation, study, and experimentation concerned with establishing and. systematizing facts, principles, and methods, as by experiments\" and hypotheses. Dr. J. Allen Hynek summed it up well in Palm Beach when he said, \"I'm merely reporting to you what has been documented.\" We need more of this reporting of documented facts. These UFO TECH NOTES are offered as an alternative tool in the complex field of UFO investigation and analysis. The plan is to cross all discipline lines and present ideas, study summaries, techniques, devices, .and concepts of potential value to the researcher. The goal is to stop-being satisfied with statements about certain aspects of UFO behavior being impossible — to find out what is really happening. Maybe we. can create a future of understanding in this field and overcome the nonsense factors. As a futurist I plan to try. (Dynamics, Continued) ranking uniformed authority among those of lower rank, must be evaluated with these factors taken into account. One ought also be concerned with differential status within a group. Within peer groups the investigator should try to identify dominants and subordinates. The former are usually easy to spot since they act dominant. They often talk the most, give orders, interject or override others' comments, etc. Their dominance may be expressed in more subtle ways but it will be expressed. Among subordinates, remember that the number two person is likely to be most supportive of the dominant's account (as a wife will often support her. husband). Remember, also, that independents may have left or been expelled from the.group long ago. Do not expect to find any unless the group is composed of strangers.. In this case, independents may have been verbally driven away before an investigator gets there: Always ask (repeatedly) for the names of other witnesses or possible witnesses. If a witness seems upset or disturbed by the account given be prepared to see him (or her) later. Do not force the witness to make a hard public choice. If any witnesses seem unduly silent do not press them. If they are expedient conformists it is better to interview them later than to force public support for the group account. Remember that if they have seen an. ambiguous stimulus they can very easily become a true conformist. Remember, also, that if they knew or cared little about the UFO phenomena before the event this is not, contrary to accepted wisdom, necessarily a point in their favor. It may predispose them to conformity. Finally, remember that everything that I have said consists of suggestions, not invariant rules of evidence. The group situation is a dynamic situation requiring skill and perception on the part of an investigator trying to fathom it. As a final note let us also be aware of a perspective other than that seeing social dynamics as a source of error. The UFO phenomenon has many facets.. The UFO, as an \"existential correlate\" of the phenomenon, is only one of these. It must be apparent that the phenomenon has cultural and mythic elements. For those interested in these cultural and mythic elements, the social dynamics of multiple witness reports should be one focus of study. 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"I\" By Ann Druffcl The Importance of the Past The current trend is for newspapers, magazines, and research journals to select fresh new sightings for publication. The fact remains, however, that many UFO occurrences of potentially great significance occurred years ago and have been kept secret for one reason or another. Such a case surfaced on March 6,1978, as a result of publicity given SKYNET in the Los Angeles Times. SKYNET is a localized filter center and tracking system which is an adjunct of MUFON in the Los Angeles Basin area. A local businessman, requesting anonymity, shared the details of a fantastic UFO experience that occurred when he was on active duty with the Air Force Air Defense Command in the late 1950's. We shall call our informant Mr. C., for he cannot be sure that the U.S. Government will take kindly to his disclosure regarding a UFO incident that endangered the life of an F-86D pilot and nearly destroyed his valuable aircraft. I have tried to seek permission for the former airman to speak out publicly, but-the government officials contacted, typically, prefer to hide behind vague regulations and trick answers. Mr. C. said that he was on duty with the 740th AC&WS Squadron at Ellsworth AFB in South Dakota. The year, as far as can be determined, was 1957. At 2:00 or 3:00 AM a call came from an adjacent radar site requesting confirmation on an unknown airborne target that was behaving strangely. The other radar site had painted it hovering, then suddenly rushing forward at 100 miles per hour. The 740th Squadron radar plotted the target and confirmed it fully, making many checks to be sure the blip was not caused by weather or some electrical 14 phenomenon. It was determined that the radar signal was from a solid, unknown object at 30,000 feet. Mr. C., who was the Air Force radar controller on duty, scrambled a fighter from the 54th Fighter Interceptor Squadron to investigate. The fighter squadron and the radar base were both part of the 29th Air Squadron. The night was calm and dark, as an F-86D radar-equipped jet rushed toward the vicinity of the object. The jet's radar picked up a contact in the same spot where both ground radar sites painted it. But there was no visual evidence of an object. Suddenly, at the exact spot where the object was supposedly hovering, the pursuing aircraft met severe turbulence. The target disappeared simultaneously on all three scopes, then about 3 seconds later reappeared 60 miles away. The fantastic speed of the maneuver indicated that the object had traveled on the order of 10,000 mph. Again the plane was vectored toward the object, which was, as before, being painted on three radars but still presenting no visual appearance. As the plane passed directly through the blip, the turbulence was so severe that the F-86D was practically knocked upside down. It was only with valiant effort that the pilot was able to control it. Once again the object disappeared off the scopes, simultaneously with the teeth-shattering turbulence,. and reappeared a few seconds later, miles away in another part of the sky. Mr. C. prepared to vector the F- 86D toward the object a third time. But the jet's pilot had had enough. Refusing to approach the object again he said, \"If you want to see what that thing is, come up here and do it yourself!\" With that, the pilot flew off and landed at his base. The radar control crew of the 740th Squadron dutifully noted the puzzling incident in their log. The next day they received orders through official channels that the logs must be changed. All reference to the object and the jet chase were ordered erased. Though greatly puzzled, the crew followed orders. In 1958, after serving 4 years, Mr. C. left the Air Force and at present is employed in a position of responsibility in the Los Angeles area. As the years passed, he said nothing to anyone regarding the incident, for he did not know what regulations might be in effect to enforce silence, even on a civilian. Of one thing, however, he was certain. The object had been real, solid and large. Not only that, its speed was incredibly beyond any aircraft known on earth. He theorized that the turbulence that had severely shaken the F-86D might have been due to a temporary vacuum left by the rapid departure of the object, and into which the jet unwittingly flew. At least two of the airmen in the control tower on the night in question live in the Southern California area and will confirm the incident, according to Mr. C. He wishes before they are contacted, however, that the problem of governmental regulations be cleared up. The popularity of the film \"Close Encounters\" and the resultant acceptance of the UFO phenomenon by press and other media persuaded Mr. C. early in 1978 that now was the time to make the incident known. But he wished to find out where he stood before making his experience public. He asked the questions, \"What would be the situation of a former military man releasing information on a UFO experience since all UFO data has,"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"ostensibly, been \"declassified\"? In accordance with Mr. C's request, I wrote to Secretary of Defense Harold Brown at the Pentagon on March 11, 1978, giving Mr. C. full anonymity. On March 21 the following answer came from Colonel Charles D. Cooper, USAF, Deputy Chief, Community Relations Division, Office of Information, Dept. of the Air Force, Washington, D.C. ... in 1978 all AF documentation regarding UFO phenomena was transferred to the National Archives and Records Service in Washington, D.C. to insure greatest public .accessibility. However, the alleged sighting [Mr. C.'s] may have resulted in a Communication Instructions for Reporting Vital Intelligence Sightings (CIRVIS) \" report which' is used to document various 'sightings of unexplained or unusual events . . . Blanket releasability of CIRVIS reports is not possible due to the wide range of defense topics covered by them. Each report would have to be reviewed on an individual basis ... to determine \"releasability.  . . If this sighting did not generate a CIRVIS report, we know of no reason why the incident cannot be presented to interested organizations. If the former AF member has any ' further questions . . . advise him to correspond directly with this office ... The above letter was discussed at length with Mr. C. As far as he could determine, the incident had not resulted in a CIRVIS report, at least not to his knowledge. Although it had occurred in the : course of' the daily function of his radar crew, the reports they had made of it had been Ordered scrubbed. Mr. C. could not see how in any sense it could be part of a CIRVIS report if there was no record of the incident existent. But how could he approach the AF with this? He would be accusing them of \"scrubbing the log\" and talking about something that technically had never happened. In my opinion, the AF was handing Mr. C. a two-edged sword. How could he be aware that ah incident was part of a CIRVIS report if such a report had been filed concerning the incident by the higher officials who ordered the crew to delete the incident from their logs? At this point, however, Mr. C. is satisfied that the above facts can safely be given publicity, provided his anonymity is protected for the'time being. He is hopeful some other UFO research organization or independent researcher has private knowledge of the same incident from another source, perhaps even the jet pilot himself. Since there is safety in numbers, it is only through this means that the puzzling secrecy with which the U. S. government still treats some UFO cases can be fought. As an addendum to this report, I wish to suggest an alternative theory regarding the \"turbulence\" caused by the UFO. This theory might explain the invisibility of the unknown object as well. If the object was not \"material\" in the ordinary sense, yet was capable ot maintaining sufficient solidity to be \"painted\" as a solid blip on three separate radar sets simultaneously, is it possible that\" it had the ability to materialize and dematerialize at will? Could the object have been able to deflect light waves from its surface, thereby remaining invisible to the jet pilot, even as the aircraft was rushing toward it? Could it have dematerialized at the instant the jet rushed into'it, creating a vacuum or near-vacuum in the space it had occupied? Did onrushing air filling this vacuum cause the turbulence severe enough to nearly overturn a heavy jet fighter? Mr. C. L prefers the theory stated above to explain the turbulence — that the object had the ability to speed away at 3 miles per second, leaving a tremendous : wash of air into which the jet flew twice. But knowing of numerous cases where UFOs have been seen by reliable witnesses to materialize and dematerialize,' evidently at will, I wonder what really happened.

The year started off with an interesting event reported from near Lithgow, New South Wales, on January 4 at about 9:30 PM. Noting an orange glow in the distance, two people travelling in a car put it down to a bushfire at first, until it approached their vehicle. As it seemed to be overhead they saw it was in fact a huge circular, diffuse glow which was confined within its own parameters. At this point their car became enveloped in a fog bank which persisted until the glow had passed by. 1 Following this, on January 20 at 1:45 AM a Port Kenny, South Australian farmer stepped outside to relieve himself and noticed that there was a bright flashing in the sky like lightning, which lit up the ground. Upon looking up he saw a bright ball of light travelling along, at close range. This ball then took off at high speed. 2 What was to be the first of two close encounter type three reports for the year happened on February 3 at Seven Mile Beach, Tasmania, at 9:30 PM. Some children at a youth camp heard a noise and saw a spinning \"dome\" with flashing lights and windows. In the center window they said they saw a figure. The figure appeared to be thin with a largish rounded head above what looked like a high collar. It had an arm visible to the right. It moved its head and changed positions in the window. After 1 or 2 minutes observation the object moved away. 3 On April 18 a man standing by the side of his truck at Port Macquarie, New South Wales, at 4:30 AM saw an estimated 16-meter-diameter bright white light ascending over sand hills some 150 meters away from him. He stood there amazed until the light came 16 towards him, and when it got to within 30 meters he entered the truck cabin. Watching from there he saw it back off and descend over the dunes, then speed away out to sea only a few meters above the waterline. After a while it left the sea surface and climbed into the sky. 4 South Australia featured 4 days later when at about midnight a young lady driving home had car trouble of an unusual sort. She saw an oval-shaped light coming toward her car and upon it seeming to pass overhead, the lights on the car died, the engine stopped, and the car radio cut off. Four seconds later they all returned to normal. Thoroughly frightened she continued on her way home. 5 On May 2 a man out camping on the river Murray at Cal Lai was confronted with a very unusual sight. He and his son were sitting by a campfire when he turned around and was surprised to see a blue \"trapezoid\", some 2 meters high by 75 cm wide at the top tapering to 45 cm across the bottom, stationary in front of a tree 10 meters away. He looked away and upon looking back it had gone. No sound was heard. 6 Eighteen days later and only a few kilometers away, a young nurse was on her way by car to work, when she came across a red glowing ball sitting a few meters away from a road, in a paddock. Seemingly 5-10 meters in diameter, it rose into the air and was lost to sight. 7 Some six days after this, on the 26th, a physical trace case came to light in Orange, New South Wales, and was quickly investigated by UFOR(NSW). Around midnight a boy observed an orange sphere with \"windows\" in it, at low altitude, possibly resting on the ground, near a farm. His mother was called and also saw it before it moved over a hill and was lost to sight. Physical traces were found in the paddock where it was observed. The traces consisted of four small cleared patches arranged in a trapezoid. The grasses and thistles within the area were not affected in any obvious way. Upon analysis it was found that if any ionizing radiation was involved the ground would have received less than 100 rad and that any heating involved in forming the cleared patches would have been below 205°C. 8 On May 30 at 10:30 PM, a person out shooting near Opossum Bay, Tasmania, reported seeing a \"silver ball, edged with red and with a red tail\", 10 meters off the ground about 400 meters away. It passed silently over the river Derwent and rose into the sky. 9 Tasmania featured two reports during June, the first on the 23rd. A rectangular shape with a pink flashing light 3 m long by 1 m high seemed to float close to a woman who watched it for a while before deciding to drive to a better position to observe it. However, as she did so it departed soundlessly into the northwestern sky. 10 In Casino two days later, two friends were returning home at 3 AM when they noticed flashing lights above the car that seemed to \"pace\" them, then disappear into the distance. There was no visible \"object,\" merely a group of 6-8 lights flashing yellow and pink/red. 11 Just over a week later, on July 2, another Tasmanian car event occurred. A bright red light 3 m off the road and 200 m behind a car was noted by the occupants. The car lost power for 15-20 seconds and had to be clutch started. The light by then had disappeared. Some time later exactly the same thing happened to the car, but this time there were no lights observed. 12 A very large (200 m.long) pink colored \"Jumbo jet\" looking object was reported to have touched down"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"beneath some high power electricity lines near Birdwood, South Australia, on July 30 at 3:45 PM. (See No. 120, November 1977.) It was then said to have taken off vertically, though it made no noise while moving at what was stated to have been supersonic speed. 13 At least 12 people were witness to the next encounter during daylight hours, near Meekatharra, West Australia. A disc-shaped object rose from behind a rocky outcrop (outcrop was only 50 m from house). As it rose, a sort of vapor rolled down the rocks. The disc, with domes on top and bottom, gave \"birth\" to a smaller red object that came out of the side of the larger one, then shot out of sight at high speed. The larger one then rose and disappeared from view. 14 To round off the year's events as far as close encounters go, as it seems to have gone \"quiet\" since then until the beginning of 1978, we have a fairly good but in some ways nebulous type three event. On October 17 at Mt. Magnet, which is near Meekatharra, two people were paced in their car by a light which stayed some 50 m from them. They called in at a hotel and were informed that some employees of the hotel also had been pursued by something. Eight people then drove to the spot where the light had been last seen. They reported seeing three round pulsating red and green objects landed in paddocks some 3 km from the hotel. The objects took off-and moved around, landing several times before they left. There appeared to be \"objects\" moving around these three objects. They were of human size, and weren't animals. REFERENCES 1..UFOR (NSW), ACOS Bulletin no. 11.. 2.

A comprehensive study of the bizarre CE III case that is usually anthologized as \"Kelly-Hopkinsville\" has been released by the Center for UFO Studies in a new publication, Close Encounter at Kelly and Others of 1 955, by Isabel Davis and Ted Bloecher. It is a model of UFO research and reporting: well documented, well organized, and well written. The abundant detail, more than would be necessary for a popular magazine but welcomed by a serious student of the subject, builds like brick on brick a solid wall of evidence to protect the authors from the skeptics. A reader, especially one who knows the rural South, can picture the unpainted two-room frame house standing back behind the trees on the Old MadisOnville Road in northern Kentucky, where the events of August 21, 1955, took place. The characters are well drawn: the stern, church-going widow, Glennie Lankford, of uncompromising honesty; her oldest son, \"Lucky,\" the dominant male figure in the family; his friend, Billy Ray Taylor, the only one who probably saw the UFO landing, but no one ever took what he said seriously. Of the twelve men, women, and children in the house that night, all but one saw the grotesque visitors who supposedly came from the craft. Billy Ray's young wife was just too scared to look! In a work of fiction, that would be a deft touch. Note: ACOS =. Australian Coordination Section, Center for UFO Studies. Most MUFON UFO Journal readers will be familiar with the general outline of the Kelly case, which involved an isolated farm house that was \"surrounded\" by small luminous creatures that appeared at the windows, on the roof, and in the trees. (There may have been only two or three which popped up at different places.) Responding to what they thought was an attack, the men in the house opened fire, but the creatures, even when hit at close range, only flipped over and floated away. Finally, the terrified family bolted for the two available cars and sped down the road to Hopkinsville, about 10 miles away. Isabel Davis is prepared for the critics and the skeptics. She repeats the questions and the arguments that the case has provoked, and she answers them persuasively. She concludes: \"Questions and riddles still remain — but they are questions about the 'little men,' their origin, their nature, their motivation. If the story was true, the behavior of these beings was indeed incomprehensible; but if the story was false, then the behavior of the human beings was twice as incredible.\" After reading her account of the events at Kelly, we can only agree. The second section of the book, written by Ted Bloecher, brings to light some of the less well known encounter cases of 1955. Though none compare with Kelly, they round out the picture, and it is good to have them on the record where they are accessible to the researcher. The Center for UFO Studies can be thanked and congratulated for publishing this book.

By MICHAEL LATAV011 SUff Writer SANFORD -Was ita close encounter of the third kind in York County ? Last Thursday evening at about 8:45, three Sanford men, Richard Wakefield, his cousin, Robert Gammon, and Linwood Noble were snowmobiling on Estes Lake near the New Dam Road when. Wakefield says, he spotted two large, oval shaped objects covered with red lights hoventt over the trees that surround the lake. Wakefield says he pointed the objects out to his companions and the three ap- proached for a closer look. The men say they shut off their snowmobiles and watched for a moment as the thing* hovered over the trees before \"shooting off at a high speed in the opposite direc- tion.\" An encounter with unidentified flying objects' The men aren't sure. \"They looked like big. tubs with lots of holes in them,\" says Wakefield, who, aloag with Gammon works at the Aerofab plant in Sanford. \"They were spinning and had red lights all over then.\" Gammon describes the objects as resembling \"frisbees covered with red Christmas lights,\" and Noble, who works as a truck driver and mechanic in South Portland, says the objects rotates slowly as they hovered in the sky. One fact made a distinct impression on all three men —the objects made no noise. \"We shut off our machines and there was ao noise at all coming from the things,\" says Noble. \"They couldn't have been planes because we were fairly close and there was no sound. I have no idea what they were, but I know I've never seen anything like them.\" the men didn't have long to scrutinize the objects for, shortly after they stopped their snowmobiles, according to Wakefield, \"the things zipped off and were 18 out of sight in seconds.\" Noble says the objects, which traveled sUe-by-tide at what he estimated as 40 or 50 feet apart, moved through the air smoothly f 'not like any helicopter or air- plane I've ever seen.\" \"We were going to follow them but they moved too quickly and they were gone in seconds.\" says Gammon The men decided not to report the sighting to the authorities, because, says Not4e, people would just call us crazy \" Police in Sanford. Kennebunk and Wells say no reports of strange objects in the sky were received Thursday evening Shirley Fickett, who operates the East Coast headquarters of the International UFO Bureau out of her home in Portland, says she hasn't received any reports of UFO sightings in Southern Maine recently either. However, she says a similar sighting was reported by three West Paris women last September and a few weeks ago an object \"covered with red lights' was reportedly sighted in the Bangor area The women in West Paris reported seeing two objects with similar descrip- tions, ' she says. \"They said the objects were hovering over a field there. \"It's hard to explain how three people can see the same thing at the same time,\" she says. \"I don't think people are seeing things out there. It's hard to explain but I donf think people are hallucinating when they see these things \" In her opinion, the objects are \"ex- traterrestrial\" (from outer spice), and are here \"to give us a good going over and check us out.' The three men from Sanford agree that they'll probably never know what it is that they saw. Says Gammon, \"I don't know what they were, but all I can say is I wish I'd had a camera with me at the time. That would have been great.\" CANADIAN GALLUP POLL (From the Toronto Star, March 22, 1978 A Gallup Poll taken in Canada during February 1978 shows that 46% of Canadians believe UFOs are \"real\" (compared to 57% of U.S. residents; see No. 125, p. 18). Awareness of the UFO subject was 81% .(compared to 93% among U.S. adults) and 10% thought they had seen a UFO (compared to 9% of U.S. adults). As in the United States, those under 30 tended to believe in UFO reality more often than those over 30 (58% vs. 70% for the comparable U.S. age bracket). JMarkR.Herbstritt stronotny Notes THE SKY FOR JULY 1978 Mercury — Throughout the month it can be seen very low in the west after sunset. Greatest elongation east (27 degrees) occurs on the 21st, but this is not a particularly favorable one; the planet stands about 14 degrees above the horizon at sunset. Venus — Although it is becoming brighter and moving further east of the sun, it is becoming less favorably placed for northern observers, and is quite low in the southwest at sunset. Mars — Moving from Leo into Virgo, it is low in the southwest at sunset and sets about 2 l / 2 hours later. Jupiter — It is too close to the sun for observation, being in conjunction on the 10th. Saturn — In Leo, it is low in the west at sunset and sets about 2 hours later. On the 10th it is 0.1 degree south of Venus and on the 19th it is 1.0 degree north of Regulus."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Lucius Farish In Others' Words A UFO sighting by TV personality Orson Bean was detailed in the April 11 issue of NATIONAL ENQUIRER. The April 18 ENQUIRER told of the \"jellyfish of light\" UFO sighting over Petrozavodsk in the Soviet Union. While the sighting was \"explained\" as the result of a secret Soviet rocket launch, Soviet investigators contend there was much more to the incident than that. A new national poll reveals that 52% of the American public believes that UFOs could be real, according to the April 25 ENQUIRER. This same issue presents the beliefs of various celebrities concerning UFOs. Elke Sommer tells of her UFO sighting in the May 2 issue; another report in this issue describes large UFOs seen in northwestern Arkansas during December 1977. Sightings of UFOs over the so-called \"Great Lakes Triangle\" are featured in the May 16 ENQUIRER. An alleged United Nations probe into a 1976 Mexican incident involving the medical examination of a UFO occupant was reported in the April 25 issue of THE STAR. A new UFO photo from Dorset, England is featured in the May 16 issue of THE STAR. One of the most interesting UFO sighting reports in some time occurred on January 1,1978, over Santa Monica, California. Robert J. Kirkpatrick's article in the June issue of FATE gives all the details of the sighting and subsequent investigations. (See MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 122, January 1978.) The June issue of UFO REPORT contains articles on UFOs and Bigfoot, the new TV series \"Project U.F.O.,\" the moons of Mars and other topics, plus an excerpt from Jim and Coral Lorenzen's latest book, ABDUCTED!. The #10 (Summer) issue of TRUE rLYING SAUCERS & UFOs had its usual assortment of articles, but a good many of them pertain to non-UFO- related topics and seem rather out of place. A recent new publication of interest is ENERGY UNLIMITED (3562 Moore Street, Los Angeles, CA 90066). This quarterly magazine, 56 pages in length, is primarily devoted to new energy sources, \"unorthodox\" scientific research, etc., but will also be using UFO-related material in future issues. The #1 issue contains an article by co-editor Kathleen Joyce on the research of the late Wilbert B. Smith, whose name will be familiar to all UFOlogists. Future issues will contain material on Smith's \"Project Magnet,\" UFO propulsion systems, etc., while the #4 issue will be devoted almost entirely to the UFO subject. The subscription rate if $15.00 for four issues, plus $2.00 extra for issues to be sent at book rate; $4.00 extra for first class mail. Single issues are $4.00 each, plus 50$ for book rate or $1.00 for first class delivery. An interesting new publication on the subjects of ancient technologies and mysteries of the past is FORGOTTEN AGES, published monthly by J. R. Jochmans (Box 82863, Lincoln, NE 68501). Jochmans formerly edited THE OOPARCHIST, which dealt with similar topics. The first two issues of FORGOTTEN AGES have presented articles on the art and religion of so-called \"primitive\" man, the mystery of the ancient Egyptian civilization, the \"Greek computer\" of Antikythera, etc. Single copies of the publication are available at 35C each; subscriptions are very reasonably priced at $3.00 for 12 issues. William R. Corliss' latest offering in the continuing series of books from The Sourcebook Project is ANCIENT MAN: A HANDBOOK OF PUZZLING ARTIFACTS. As in all the Corliss volumes, the data are compiled from a variety of scientific periodicals. In this instance, much of the material has been drawn from the files of AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST, AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN, AMERICAN ANTIQUITY, MAN, NATURE, SCIENCE, and other journals. Many of the topics have been widely publicized in books on the \"ancient astronaut\" theme, but Corliss has drawn from the original sources for many of the accounts. Subjects covered include vitrified forts, the Baghdad battery, medicine wheels, the Nazca markings, giant skeletons, Stonehenge, the Mexican \"Messiah\" and other indications of lost cultures and civilizations. The HANDBOOK has 786 pages of source material, with 240 illustrations, full bibliographic citations, etc. at $15.95, it is one of the few books worth the price. Highly recommended, as are all volumes from The Sourcebook Project. Order from Corliss at: P.O. Box 107, Glen Arm, Maryland 21057.

D., 6601 Seven Mile Road, South Lyon, MI 48178, telephone (313) 437-9545, has accepted the position of State Director for Michigan. To complement Harry, Dan R. Wright, M.A., 931 DeGroff, Grand Ledge, MI 48837, telephone (517) 627- !*728, has been appointed State Section Director for the Michigan Counties of Clinton, Eaton, and Ingham. Since Ted Peters, Ph.D. Consultant in Theology and State Director for Louisiana is transferring from Loyola University in New Orleans to a Lutheran Seminary in Berkeley, CA, it has been necessary to reorganize the State structure. Michael A. Delhom, 3201 Kaliste Saloom Rd., #107, Lafayette, LA 70508, telephone (318) 981-6918, formerly a State Section Director, has been elevated to the position of State Director replacing Dr. Peters.

Box 368, Scott, LA 70583, has become the State Section Director for the Louisiana parishes of Lafayette, St. Martin, Acadia, St. Landry, Vermillion, and Iberia, filling the vacancy created by Mike Delhom's promotion. James J. LaChute 124 Papworth Ave., Metairie, LA 70005, telephone (504) 831-2794, was selected to be the State Section Director for the parishes around New Orleans of Orleans, St. Bernard, Plaquemines, LaFourche, Terre Bonne, St. James, St. John the Baptist, St. Charles, Jefferson, and St. Tammany. One of the early members of MUFON as a teen-ager, Jim is a University student and has visited MUFON in Seguin while on Air Force Reserve training at Kelly Field. To add to the MUFON coverage in Louisiana, David A. Craig, 1127 North Border Drive, Bogalusa, LA 70427, has been appointed State Section Director for Washington, Tangipahoa, Helena, and Livingston parishes. All three of these gentlemen have organized local UFO investigative teams in their areas. Paul Cerny, Western Regional Director, has designated Thomas D. Page, 1728 Moclips Drive, Petaluma, CA 94952, telephone (707) 763-7710, as State Section Director for Somona, Napa, and Marin counties in California. Tom is a science teacher and private pilot. David L. Perkins, Libre, Box O, Farisita, CO 81037, is MUFON's new State Section Director for Huerfano, Costilla, Las Animas, and Alamosa Counties in Colorado. David is also a teacher. Due to the inconsistent \"skip distance\" of the MUFON 20 meter Amateur Radio Net, Joe Santangelo, N1JS, the Amateur Radio Director, has announced that it will be discontinued as a weekly net. The two nets meeting each Saturday morning at 0700 and 0800 Central Time zone as listed in the JOURNAL have proven very successful for communicating UFO information and MUFON activities nationwide. In the \"Director's Message\" of the April 1978 issue of the JOURNAL, an announcement was made concerning the selection of a new International Coordinator to fill this position on the MUFON Board of Directors. Several people have expressed an interest and have contacted your International Director personally, however, this position has not been filled. In order to supplement the work of the International! Director and to provide better communications and services to our foreign and liaison representatives, five new positions have been created. Each continent will have a Continental Director reporting directly to the International Coordinator, who will communicate directly with the foreign representatives or National Directors. We will thus cover South America, Africa, Asia, Australia/New Zealand, and Europe in this manner. Mexico and Central America will be included with South America since they are Spanish speaking nations. People who are fluent in the predominate languages for the continent involved, or who have translators available would be best qualified to fill these posts. Written correspondence will be the major occupation involved in this position. Please contact your International Director for further details if you are interested in volunteering for one of these responsibilities. Charles L. Tucker joined MUFON on October 18, 1975, as the,State Section Director for Elkhart and Kosciusko Counties in Indiana. He has now accepted the position of State Director for Indiana and will select a replacement for the vacated position in his new State organization. His mailing and business address is Box 228, Nappanee, IN 46550, where he may be reached during the week at (219) 773- 7711 or weekends in Michigan at (517) 278-5945.
