Leir MUFON consultant August is not a month when I am usually overly busy with patients in the office, but Monday, Aug. 3, was the exception. I found myself overbooked and rap- idly falling behind my schedule. I instructed Sheri, my office manager to please eliminate all distractions. At about three o'clock in the af- ternoon, she announced, \"Dr. Leir, I believe you will want to take this one. It's Whitley Strieber and he is calling long distance.\" Whitley instantly gave me the reason he was calling. \"Roger, I'm working with NBC. They have agreed to do a two-hour prime time television special on the UFO subject. For the most part the program will be based on my newest book, Confirmation. As you know my last chapter was devoted to the work you and Derrel Sims have been doing. I suggested to the producer that if possible, they might be able to film an actual implant extraction surgery being performed. In addition we would take the specimen to a well qualified lab and have the object tested. This could all be done in front of the camera. There would be no question as to the authenticity and documentation of the entire proceed- ing.\" I slumped down in my chair and tried to digest what was just presented to me. After recovering my composure I told him I would get in touch with Derrel right away and get his opinion. I also asked Whitley what time schedule they had in mind. He told me the pressure was on everybody that had anything to do with the production, and they wanted it done right away. I explained to him that this required a great deal of preparation. We would have to find the right surgical candidate, make arrangements with the surgical facil- ity, call the surgical team, and perform hundreds of other chores necessary to doing this successfully. I also ex- plained that the previous criteria and protocols Derrel and I had established for the National Institute for Dis- covery Science (N.I.D.S.) would have to be followed to the letter without compromise. Whitley seemed satisfied with all that I had proposed. His first request, if we agreed to go forward, was to present the producer with a budget for the sur- About the author Dr. Leir attended the University of South- ern California and San Fernando Valley College, earning the B.S. in 1961.

Dr. Leir operates a private practice and is the state sec- tion director for the Ventura-Santa Barbara MUFON group. EDITOR'S NOTE: As pointed out in the November issue, there is disagreement as to whether \"implants\" exist. However, if there are such things as implants-and many in the field feel there are- they represent physical evidence which should be looked at. Dr. Leir and his associates have taken the initiative. Others should also get involved. gery. With all this on my mind, I continued seeing pa- tients until finally completing the last procedure at about 7 p.m. With the working day behind me I could now concentrate on the proposed surgery. I sat down at my desk and called Derrel. His response was more sober- ing than I had anticipated. He had a basic distrust of individual television producers no matter how large the benefactor. He asked me what assurances we had that they would not distort the scientific nature of our work, and use debunkers and skeptics to offset the scientific material we were presenting. I told Derrel that I would try to find the answers to his questions. The next day I was on the telephone with not only the producer of the proposed show, but back with Whitley again. I asked them the questions that Derrel had proposed. The answers seemed satisfactory to me. Since the show has not aired yet, we will all have to wait and see what the ultimate results will be. They did agree to the following: . 1. To present our material without dramatic ex- aggeration. 2. Not to use debunkers or skeptics. 3. Not to use the names of our medical partici- pants. 4. Not to use the actual name of the surgical patient or show his face. 5. To highlight the second hour of the produc- tion with mainly our material. 6. To promote the content of the program with- out exaggeration. The surgical candidate The patient we selected was Paul Dering*, a 45-year-old male with an object in his thumb. He be- came aware of the object as a result of a skiing acci- dent in 1990.. The emergency room physician showed him an x-ray taken of his hand which showed a small dense radiographic object in the left thumb. Paul was"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 December 1998 MUFON UFO Journal dumbfounded when he saw the x-ray. He had no idea how such an object came to be in his thumb. What puzzled him even more was the fact that there was no scar evident. He could not recall any event from his childhood or military career that would have created an injury resulting in the foreign object imbedding it- self deep within the thumb. Paul explained to me that he asked his physician, who was part of an HMO, to remove the object, but was told the procedure was not going to be covered. He let the subject drop and did not pursue it further. Local MUFON meeting I first met Paul at a local MUFON meeting. He had come to hear a presentation that Derrel and I had given regarding implants. He was fascinated by what he heard and approached me following the presenta- tion. Paul told me he thought he had an object in his left thumb and that he had no memory of how it got there. I had heard these stories hundreds of times pre- viously, so I asked if he had any evidence that would prove his contention that there was a foreign object in his finger. I was surprised when he stated emphatically that indeed he did. I asked him what the evidence was and he told me he saw the object in an x-ray. Next I inquired how I could see the x-ray and Paul told me it was quite simple because he had it at home. With that I handed him a business card and asked him to contact me at the office. About six weeks later Paul called the office and made an appointment to see me. He brought the x- ray with him. I placed it on the view screen and to my surprise noted a small radio-opaque object, which ap- peared very similar to the others we had removed ly- ing next to the bone in his left thumb. I suggested that we take a fresh x-ray to verify the object was still there. He agreed and new x-rays were taken which also showed the object. I asked Paul if he had ever seen a UFO or thought he might be involved with the alien abduction phenomenon. He told me a couple of stories where he had seen a UFO and thought that he might have had missing time. An ideal candidate I placed Paul high up on the surgical candidate list and called Derrel to advise him of the situation. I explained Paul's cases as well as the others. He gave careful consideration to Paul's case and after consid- ering all the factors we both chose Paul as the ideal surgical candidate for filming. I immediately started with the preparations for the surgery. The first thing was to obtain a surgical facility where we would not only be able to perform the surgery, but also one which has a portable x-ray device necessary to do the procedure. In addition it would have to be able to accommodate not only the F.I.R.S.T. television crew, but also the NBC produc- tion crew. We would also need to send a live feed out to those who were eyewitnesses to the procedure. Af- ter making several telephone calls I was referred to a local outpatient surgical facility. It turned out I had known the owner many years ago, and he was more than happy to accommodate our needs. The next step was to bring together the sur- gery team. Both my secretary and I made the neces- sary phone calls. They all seemed happy with the pros- pect of doing another surgery. It would be a meeting of friends and familiar faces. We made a detailed list of those we wanted to attend and sent out the invitations. At the same time consultations continued with the NBC producer. A surgical budget was submitted, revised and resubmitted again. Finally there was approval. I real- ized we were on the way, but I could not rest and relax yet. There would be many other hurtles to climb over. The surgical date was set for Aug. 17. We had to bring Derrel in from Texas some days prior to that date so that he could work with the patient prior to the surgery; otherwise there would be no abduction his- tory to use for any purpose, including the dramatiza- tion needed for the TV show. The patient was only able to recall two specific events. When Derrel finally arrived on the scene and started working with the pa- tient he was able to obtain nine separate and distinct events. In keeping with our criteria and protocols, no hypnosis was to be used prior to the surgery. We did not want the usual criticism regarding hypnosis as it pertains to a patient's recall of abduction events.. Questions, confusion, turmoil Aug. 17 was suddenly upon us. I arrived at the surgical facility early. It was a good thing that I did, because from the moment I got there until the moment I left there was nothing but questions, confusion, and turmoil. For example it was not only necessary for the television crews to coordinate their procedures, but they would be running cables and placing cameras in a very small space. No matter who went into the operating room, they had to be dressed in the required surgical garb. They would have to learn the rules or endure the wrath of the surgical supervisor, who would think noth- ing of throwing them out on their ear. One of the major problems was that only nine people could actually be in the surgery suite itself. Because of the type of x-ray equipment that was going to be used, it was required that all personnel wear lead x-ray protective gear. There were only nine lead aprons and one lead screen. That would mean a maximum of ten people. Since the surgery was being performed on the hand, rather than on a foot, I could not perform the operation myself. I had to enlist the services of one of"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal December 1998 PageS Dr. Roger K. Leir analyzes x-rays of patient's left thumb. The object is visible as a white spot. our general surgeons, Dr. Ablemeiser*. I would be there to either act as a surgical nurse or narrator. As it turned out, all I could do was narrate the procedure. The head count was as follows: the general surgeon, myself, a medical anesthesiologist, Derrel (who was performing a hypnoanesthesia), the scrub nurse, the circulating nurse, the x-ray operator, the F.I.R.S.T. camera opera- tor, the NBC camera operator, and the producer. In- structed to immediately leave the surgical suite were the NBC lighting operator and the NBC sound man, who were both relegated to a small adjoining room and could indicate their wishes by gesturing through a glass partition. The patience of the surgical supervisor was astounding. A wave of silence Slowly a wave of silence descended upon the room until the only voice heard was Derrel's voice com- mands to the patient. He spoke in a soft but command- ing tone: \"Your left hand and arm will be heavy, like lead. Your hand will have no feeling, it will be com- pletely numb. You will only hear the sound of my voice.\" At one point I overheard the medical anesthe- siologist ask Derrel how he was able to produce such a deep state of hypnosis. He answered with a com- ment referring to something that sounded like an Esdale State of hypnosis, and I heard the medical anesthesi- ologist gasp and ask if he would teach her how to do that procedure. Dr. Ablemeiser was given the nod. He imme- diately picked up the surgical scalpel and made a small but precise incision into the thumb. A tourniquet was used to stop the bleeding so the surgical field remained dry of blood. Once the procedure was underway I be- gan narrating the event for the television cameras and for the audience witnessing the procedure in the wait- ing room. All went according to plan. An x-ray view- ing apparatus called a C-Arm was used to visualize the object on two television screens. A probe was used to locate and actually touch the object. Then, a clamp was used to isolate and retain the object for removal. Once it is was out, the television cameras closed in for their close-up views. I stood there in a state of amazement with the hair standing straight up on the back of my neck. This was another little canta- loupe seed-shaped object covered with the same dark gray membrane that we had seen before. This object was so much the same as the others, I would have de- fied anyone to actually tell them apart if they were put side by side. Our good Dr. Ablemeiser, who had done some of the prior surgeries with us, was heard to com-"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Page 6 December 1998 MUFON UFO Journal ment, \"My, that is a weird looking thing.\" He is by nature an ultraconservative and, although open-minded, not a believer in this phenomenon. Once the procedure was over, the patient was taken to the recovery room, and the television crew followed. Finally, the only one left in the operating room was myself. I was wearing my scrub suite, about eight pounds of lead, including a high lead collar, my surgical cover gown, cap, mask and shoe covers. The air-conditioning was shut off because the film crew had to make sure there were no additional sounds com- ing through the mike, and the temperature was stifling. I was instructed to stay with the specimen until I was told to wheel it out on a cart. At that time I would turn the biological material over to a waiting pathologist, all being done on camera. Over and over This scene had to be done over and over again until the director was satisfied with the job. During this time I stood in utter shock as I watched the freshly removed specimen begin to shrink before my eyes. I had to pinch myself to see if I was imagining what I was seeing. However the reality of the situation was just that. The object was reducing its size right before my eyes. Finally I realized that perhaps it was just dehydrating. I was relieved when I was finally able to place it in the blood serum solution. It then began to regain it's normal shape. Both the soft tissue specimen and the metal- lurgical portion were sealed into containers, and a docu- ment signed by four witnesses accompanied the ob- jects to their destinations. The metal was taken to the University of Texas in San Antonio, and the soft tis- sue portions were given to a local laboratory in the southern California area. A portion of these tests were performed at UCLA. One of the most unusual findings was the x- ray diffraction examination, which in all but one test showed no visible peaks. This was quite strange, since the object was highly magnetic and polar, indicating an iron core. More details of this and other implant specimens appear in my new book, The Aliens and the Scalpel, which is now available by calling: toll free 800-366-0264.

Dennis Balthaser no longer with Roswell UFO museum By Dennis Balthaser truthskr@roswell.net This will serve as a blanket notification that on Oct. 28,1998, Glenn Dennis, president of the Interna- tional UFO Museum and Research Center in Roswell, NM, told me to sever all relationships with the Mu- seum, and I was not to be affiliated with the Museum anymore. As most of you know I have in the past been on the Board of Directors, was the Operations Man- ager, and most recently the UFO Investigator. All three of those positions were very rewarding, always put- ting the interest of the Museum, the witnesses, and visi- tors in the forefront. That meant doing and saying things that at times were not agreeable to everyone. I have no regrets for anything I did at the Mu- seum during the past two years, as I think the results speak for themselves. I will continue to do research, investigations and lectures, so I ask that you keep in touch."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal December 1998 Page? Dr. Joe Lewels Professional ethics in abduction research By Joe Lewels, Ph.D. How many persons are doing abduction re- search in the U.S. today? How many are using hypno- sis as a tool in their research? How many of those are properly trained and certified? And how many are ad- hering to the principles of sound ethical conduct? Be- cause I think nobody really knows the answers to these questions, I am offering the following in hopes that it will help others who are struggling with these issues. In my research and in my travels as a lecturer, I am constantly either meeting or finding out about new re- searchers who are working in this field. They seem to be everywhere-in every major city and in many small towns, as well as in obscure rural communities. The need is so great that abduction support groups are springing up everywhere, and with them come those who begin to dabble in hypnosis. In some cases, local hypnotherapists or medical professionals are also re- cruited, even though they at times agree to participate reluctantly. In all cases, there is a need to understand what constitutes professional ethics. In 1993, when I began a research project into the alien abduction phenomenon, 1 knew only what I had read in books and from attending a UFO confer- ence. But I had a strong desire to learn all that I could about an issue that, if true, could change everything we think we know about the world around us.'Because I knew that I was a novice, I began by recruiting a psychiatrist (more than one at first) and competent, certified hypnotherapists. All of us were new to ab- duction research, but we were all determined to go about it in as professional a way as possible. Became certified In time, I became certified by the American Board of Hypnotherapy and began to conduct hypno- sis sessions under the watchful eye of our psychiatric expert. In the process, I soon learned that there are important ethical considerations in conducting abduc- tion research. The first ethical question that had to be answered was this: am I a researcher first or a thera- pist first? Which is more important-gathering data or helping the subject of the research? Very quickly I made what I thought was the obvious choice. I chose to place About the author Joe Lewells, who lives in El Paso, TX, is the MUFON Assistant State Director for West Texas and South New Mexico. He holds the Ph.D. in communications and journalism. the role of therapist above that of researcher. I learned, with the help of my psychiatrist partner and my hypnotherapist associates, that when dealing with trau- matized and vulnerable people, their well-being must take precedence. At first there were times when I felt we could go much further in a hypnosis session, but one of the other team members recognized that the subject had been through enough for one session. There were other times when I was very glad for the profes- sional experience of one of my colleagues. For example, there was the very first hypnosis session that I sat in on. In that case the woman was trying to access memories about an unusual childhood experience. Under hypnosis she remembered being a five-year-old child and lying on an operating table with a group of people around her. Because they were hooded, she could not see the faces clearly at first. When the hypnotherapist coaxed her into tak- ing a closer look, she let out a piercing shriek that al- most knocked me out of my chair, and she bolted up- right. None of us knew that abductees often have such a reaction when they first see the faces of the beings. With professional aplomb, our colleague calmed her down, put her back in trance, and continued the ses- sion, knowing it was important for her to get through the experience. Getting off track? In other cases, it seemed to me that the hypno- sis session was getting off track. We had come to deal with abduction experiences, but the psychiatrist or the hypnotherapist allowed the person to sidetrack into peripheral issues that seemed to be a waste of time. I began to realize that I had a lot to learn about being a therapist, particularly patience. In some cases, those peripheral issues turned out to be quite important. In one case, a subject spontaneously began speaking French (a language she was not fluent in) under hypnosis. For much of that session the hypnotherapist allowed the woman to explore the de- tails of what seemed to be a past life memory. For the woman, the memories resolved a lot of important is- sues in her current life-issues that apparently had to be resolved before she could go on with our research. In a later session, she had a different past life memory in which she realized she had chosen to live this life- time as an abductee. It was clear to me very early on that I had much to learn about the human psyche, about hypnotherapy,"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PageS December 1998 MUFON UFO Journal and about the abduction phenomenon. I was beginning to learn from my associates-who did not see them- selves as researchers primarily-that I had to respect the notion that the individual's subconscious would play an important role in directing every session. If I didn't have a broad enough mind to deal with what we dis- covered, that was my problem. I didn't have the right to judge for the subject what was real and what was not. Since then, I have tried to report my findings, re- gardless of how much they might not agree with my own beliefs or how outlandish they might seem. Soon we began to establish certain rules or guidelines for working with abductees. Before using hypnosis, we agreed that whenever possible, the psy- chiatrist should perform a psychiatric assessment of the individual. If the psychiatrist did not feel the per- son was suitable or ready for hypnosis, we would not proceed. Second, we would always try to conduct in- terviews and hypnosis sessions in the doctor's office in order to maintain a professional atmosphere. We also decided it was a good idea to always have a third per- son present during hypnosis sessions, particularly when the therapist and the subject were of different sexes. Another important decision we made was to always tape record every session for research purposes and also to protect ourselves from liability. Issue of confidentiality One of the major ethical issues we had to ad- dress was the issue of confidentiality. It was, of course, a given that all interviews and hypnosis sessions were totally confidential. Both the psychiatrist and the hypnotherapists were used to maintaining their client information secret. As the researcher of the group, I had no problem adhering to this rule. But how were we specifically going to protect the information and the tape recordings? We each knew we had a special obligation to safeguard our files and keep them under lock and key, and so we did. We also knew that we should make it clear to the subjects that their informa- tion would remain confidential. By drafting a release form for the subjects to sign, I found that I could kill two birds with one stone. In the release form, the individual is asked to allow the information to be used for research purposes in lec- tures, books, and other publications. It also allows the person to choose whether or not he/she wants to be identified. This serves as a pledge to them of confi- dentiality should they choose not to be identified, and it also gives me the legal right to use the information for my research. In the end, if there were any doubts, we knew we could refer to the codes of ethics of various organi- zations, such as the American Medical Association or the American Board of Hypnotherapy. These codes, although not having the force of law, serve as excel- lent guidelines for anyone engaged in abduction re- search. I offer them here so that others involved in this might benefit from their wisdom. Code of Professional Ethics for the American Board of Hypnotherapy All members of the American Board of Hyp- notherapy shall assist in maintaining the integrity and competence of the Hypnosis Profession by agreeing to abide by the following code of professional ethics: 1. Member shall conduct sessions at all times in a professional manner within a professional setting. 2. Member shall obey all federal, state, and local laws and regulations concerning the practice of hypnotherapy. 3. All matters between the Member/Therapist and Client/Patient shall be confidential.

An excited-possibly frightened-witness re- lated a fractured account of an experience that, for you, would be the initial square in a crazy quilt you would piece together over weeks or months. You contacted law enforcement and air traffic control, obtained accu- rate weather data, interviewed witnesses, carefully ex- amined the site, checked all the potential leads, and concluded that this was a genuine UFO encounter. Along the way, you might well have become temporarily lost in locating the witness' home or other place of the observation, ruined a nice pair of Reeboks, confronted an angry dog, and/or placated a snide deputy sheriff. Still, you persevered. When all was truly said and done, you were rightfully proud of the case report you produced, complete with all the proper MUFON forms, witness drawings, and maps of the area. So, whatever happened to that labor of love you put so much of yourself into? Be assured, your efforts were not in vain. Since 1987, the significant factors contained in all case re- ports have been catalogued in MUFON's computer- ized database. In recent years T. David Spencer, who followed me as Deputy Director in charge of investi- gations, read every report and periodically produced summary findings thereafter published in the MUFON UFO Journal. Having reassumed the Deputy position, I will continue to examine and record all incoming case files and review pre-1987 reports as well. In the pro- cess, though, I will be conducting a star search. Amid the dozens of reports arriving every month, one or more often stand out by reason of the exemplary dedication shown by the investigator(s). In the Journal issues to follow, these will be highlighted in my regular feature. Proper credit should and will be afforded to those who turn over every leaf in the search for logical conclusions, be they \"UFO\" or \"IFO,\" and without respect to a person's years of experience or position in MUFON. As always, each report must pass muster with your state or provincial director prior to forwarding, and s/he has an obligation to assist you in covering every possible base. However, eloquence or lack thereof in your phrasings will have no bearing on whether the case is given its due. In short, you the rank and file of this grassroots organization have an oppor- tunity to showcase how an investigation should really be conducted and gain some well deserved recogni- tion in the process. We all will be the beneficiaries. Now, go out there and beat the bushes-but wear an old pair of shoes, eh?

I was driving on the Saw Mill River Parkway watching this object from 9:15 to 9:40 p.m. My passengers were unable to see, due to their eyes being dilated by a doc- torearlierintheday. 1 got to their place in Ossining at about 9:50 p.m., when I noticed that the star-like color- changing object was now the top point on a 3-pointed delta-shaped object. The 3 points were connected only for a maximum of 2 to 3 seconds with a thin blue- green light line. This delta shape hung low in the north- western portion of the sky directly over the Hudson River. The three points would remain, each changing color in a twinkling fashion. \"I would estimate that the object was about 3 to 4 football fields wide at the bottom points. This was a very large object. 1 watched this object until the direction of the road changed my line of view. An interesting note is I have a portable radar detector that I had just placed a new 9 volt battery into about two weeks ago. Normal life of a 9 volt battery in my de- tector is about two months use. However, when I got within three miles of my home I noticed that the bat- tery was dead as my detector was blinking, indicating that I needed a new battery.\" Thanks to: Bowden 1818. LONG BEACH, LONG ISLAND: On Oct. 30, 1998, John P. Cox and two other witnesses no- ticed a UFO as the sun was just about to set around 5 p.m. The sky was crystal clear with the wind out of the northwest, so planes were coming in from the south- east over the ocean. At least six planes \"passed\" this object while preparing to land at either Kennedy or LaGuardia airports. The object was moving from north"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Page 10 December 1998 MUFON UFO Journal to south over Long Beach. The UFO continued south out over the ocean until it became too small to see. It appeared red in color and was shaped like a long rect- angular box. Then it started to \"bend down\" on both ends. At that point it looked like a hang-glider or ul- tra-lite. However, it kept on bending until it came to- gether. So, now it appeared to be a tall box shape Later it returned back into the rectangular shape, but not by bending back out. This time the \"wings\" ap- peared to extend out from the body. The wings ap- peared to sweep forward until again it became a com- pact tall box shape. By now it was moving out over the ocean, traveling at a steady speed and altitude the whole time. The UFO was relatively close to the ground (a few hundred to a thousand feet, maybe) Some other people must have seen the craft.

Samuel states, \"I saw something inter- esting tonight on the way home from work just north of Wayne Trace. My wife and I noticed a bright light in the sky, flying low headed eastward. We recog- nized the light as the headlight of a bright aircraft, yet it pulsated instead of blinking. As the craft got closer we noticed two blinking lights on both sides of the center light. We parked our vehicle in the middle of the road and just observed the craft as it came closer. I was out of the car listening for the recognizable sound of a helicopter. I knew it could not be a plane, as it didn't travel as a plane does. \"As it came fairly close into view I noticed that it didn't make any noise like a plane, jet or heli- copter. This craft 'hummed.' 1 also noticed a bright rear light as it passed. I asked my wife how she would describe this bright light in the rear of the craft? We felt it was yellowish or amber in color and it illumi- nated the rear section of the craft. What was strange about this rear light was how it was illuminated in ap- pearance. At first I thought I was looking at a jet en- gine flame, but there was no sound to support this, so it had to be a light mat created this cone shape glow. If this was a rear illuminating light, I could not tell you what the shape of the tail section was. After watching it \"HUM\" off into the distance, 1 believe it possibly could have been a chopper that uses some form of Si- lent Mode ability.\" Samuel is an E.M.S. rescue coordinator. He first reported \"strange lights\" previously seen by his wife and daughter near Gratis, OH, on Nov. 17, 1997. CORRECTION: In the November issue, the photo showing the message in Gen.

He was rock hunting and searching for geodes when he spied the circular disc craft. The disc appeared to land and then shoot a beam of light towards the rock wall. He was unable to see any markings or appendages on the smooth metallic disc. There was no sound. When the disc departed he went to examine the area where the craft was hover- ing. Inspection revealed a circular landing site about 15 feet in diameter. A nearby rock wall had what ap- peared to be bum marks that could have been made by the beam from the craft. The observer indicated this was his first sighting since he was a boy in his native Kolka, Latvia. He remembers the weather was warm and he was wearing shorts in the summer of 1942. He no- ticed a torpedo like object flying from south to north. He started running towards the object and realized it had slowed down enough to stay just above his posi- tion as he ran along. The torpedo like object seemed to look him over and flew an estimated 25 feet above him. In his judgment the craft was about the same size as a torpedo that is launched from submarines. The craft stayed above him as he ran. When he slowed to a walk the craft sped away. The craft made a very strange high pitched sound. In later years he learned the sound was similar to a jet engine.

Georgia Investigator John Thompson has been investi- gating some daylight UFO sightings that could be ex- plained as satellites. He contacted several astrono- mers who assured him that satellites could not be seen in the daylight. Although a new type of Iridium satel- lites can be seen under certain conditions, when the sun reflects off their shiny surface, none would have been visible for the sighting outlined below. On Sept. 25, 1998, a 38-year-old University of Alabama graduate called to say he had seen a UFO in Lee County, AL, between 1:30 and 1:40 p.m. EOT. The high-flying UFO flew directly over him three miles west of Auburn. The UFO was \"shiny white\" and of oval or cylinder shape. Speed: very, very fast! Its altitude was over 14 miles high-possibly 30-70 miles high. Witness said the silvery UFO went from directly overhead, 12 o'clock position, to 2 o'clock position \"in a couple of seconds.\" Incredibly, the UFO had an apparent size of an 1/8 of an inch. This suggests a real size of approxi- mately 400 feet long at 14 miles, and more likely-as the UFO, according to the witness, was flying where the atmosphere turns its darkest at extreme elevation- as much as 2,000 feet long at 70 miles high. No sound or electrical interference (he had his radio on) was noted. There were a few \"wispy\" clouds, and unlim- ited visibility at 87 degrees F. A call was placed to the FAA in Columbus and Auburn Airport, but nothing unusual was reported. Ac- cording to Mr. Burdette, their \"central radar\" would have picked up any transponder equipped object to \"60,000 feet.\" Since this UFO was above 60,000 feet it would not have registered, whether transponder- equipped or not! He saw a solid craft of enormous size moving at extraordinary speed from east to west. The La Grange, GA, witness is well-educated and has an excellent reputation. It's obvious that with the Iridium satellites we are going to have to be more vigilant with reports of unknowns that move faster than planes and are acutely high. The fact is that the new Iridium highly polished satellites do cause flares for short periods of time. ROBERT.D.MATSON@cpmx.saic.com has developed an Iridium flare predicting site that may be helpful. Robert indicates no Iridium satellite would have been visible. LA GRANGE: We have a daylight Sept. 27, 1998, sighting of a dull black triangle UFO, the size of a small plane, at 12:45 p.m..

STONE MOUNTAIN FREEWAY: MUFON Director Walter Sheets reports a female witness was driving east on Hwy 78 at about 12 noon on Aug. 21, 1998. As she approached Bethney Church Road, she saw an unusual object almost overhead. She leaned forward to get a closer look and saw a dull silver gray craft shaped like a pharmaceutical capsule. 1 he U FO was traveling south somewhat faster than a passenger jet. The craft was the same length as a dime held at jrm's length. She estimated that it was several tho^sa^d feet in altitude. She had a good look for about six seconds, and saw a clear outline with no protuberances, wings, markings or other structures on the craft. This witness completed a sketch of the ob- ject, and a diagram of the sighting area. She is a re- tired school teacher with a master's degree in educa- tion from a large university, and taught the general sci- ences. Colorado SAN LUIS VALLEY: After two years of rela- tive quiet, Chris O'Brien reports that unusual activity has increased in recent weeks. On Oct. 8, 1998, four miles west of Blanca, while headed east on Highway 160, a witness observed an amber colored \"hemispheri- cal-shaped\" light hovering over the Blanca Massif. She estimated the lights as about the size of Venus. After a few seconds, the object appeared to jump approximately 20 degrees upward. She pulled off the road and parked with her engine running to care- fully observe the light at 10:30 p.m. The witness is confused and could not completely remember how long she watched, but she guessed \"several minutes.\" The next thing she clearly recalled was the craft flying at a high rate of speed above her car, headed NE to SW. She described a \"triangle-shaped array of white and amber lights\" blinking sequentially in \"patterns\" on the underneath side. Chris has a regular radio program in Colorado. Montana RONAN: Since Oct. 16, 1998, UFOs have been reported by several hundred witnesses and two local papers over the Mission Valley in western Mon- tana. The sightings have continued at various intervals and various durations. They have occurred somewhere between the hours of 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. on non-pattern evenings, roughly located above the immense Mission Mountain Range hovering in place at approximately 20,000 feet above sea level and 9,000 feet above the top of the Mission Range. It has been reported by more than 500 witnesses, including professionals, po- lice personnel who have gone on record, night shift workers, travelers, and locals. The UFO is reported to be quite large, with one continuous red light, a flickering (not blinking) green light, and a flickering blue glow under the craft. Outline and shape have been undetermined ai ihis time. The primary locale for observation of the craft has been in and around areas of Poison, MT, a town of 6,000 that is located ten miles north of the town of Ronan. Thanks to Nancy L.

Finland entities HELSINKI-On Nov. 13, 1998, Eusebius Vahanlanta saw a huge lightning in the northern sky followed by strange vibrations at 7:10 p.m. \"It lasted for about five minutes and then everything was silent, strangely silent-no birds singing, etc. About two min- utes after the sound we heard a sighing sound of some kind of hissing above us. We saw nothing, but the sound grew louder. The sound faded away and there was a slight thump. We were looking from our bal- cony and we saw three strange figures entering our backyard. \"They moved around a bit, but we could not make out what they were doing. One of them was glowing a purple light occasionally, and one was blink- ing like the first one, but with faster frequency. They moved about for awhile, when one of them climbed a tree. It got up about two meters, to the height of the first branches on that tree. Then the other two started making some kind of noise-a noise like striking two metal bars. Then the blinking one moved towards the tree. The one on the tree descended and they all left. We searched without finding them.\" Phone 09 3456903, Teininkatu 13 00640 Helsinki, Finland. Southern China UFO BElJING-Nov. 14, 1998, (AFP) Residents in the southern Chinese city of Xiamen have sighted an apple-like UFO with a tail of red and yellow flame. The overseas edition of the People s Daily reported the story Saturday. The party organ carried a China News Agency report saying the UFO was first sighted at 3:33 p.m. flying in a southwest direction for about twenty minutes before disappearing. A similar craft was sighted the following day. The report said the sighting of the UFO, which was also captured on film by the local television station, had Xiamen residents craning their head skywards hoping for another appear- ance."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal December 1998 Page 13 Chinese pilots chase UFO SHANGHAI, Nov. 5, 1998-<Agence France Presse) The air force had a prolonged up-close encoun- ter with a UFO last month that one fighter pilot de- scribed as \"just like ones in foreign movies,\" a gov- ernment-control led newspaper reported Thursday. A Hebei Daily report-carried in the news di- gest Baokan Wenzhai-gave a detailed pilot's account of an aerial cat-and-mouse game played between the object and a jet fighter ordered to intercept it. At least 140 people on the ground also saw the object, it said. An editor with the Hebei Daily said the events took place on Oct. 19 and were still being investigated by local government departments. It said the encounter began when four differ- ent radar stations in northern Hebei province picked up an unknown moving target in airspace directly above a military flight training base near Changzhou city. To observers at the base, the UFO first appeared like \"a small star,\" and then grew larger and larger, perhaps as it descended to a lower altitude, the report said. They described an object with a mush room-shaped dome on top and a flat bottom covered with bright, continually rotating lights. A base commander sumamed Li reported to his superiors, who ordered a Jianjiao-6 armed inter- ceptor airborne to pursue the object once checks showed no other civilian or military aircraft in the area. The two pilots aboard said the object closely resembled depictions they had seen in foreign science fiction films. When they got within 4,000 meters (13,200 feet) of the UFO over Qing county, it abruptly shot upward, easily evading subsequent attempts to get closer. It appeared to be toying with the fighter by re- peatedly outdistancing it and then reappearing just above it, the pilots said. The report said a request for permission to fire on the UFO with an onboard cannon was denied by ground command at one point. The in- terceptor was eventually forced to return to base after it ran out of fuel at an altitude of 12,000 meters (39,600 feet). The UFO then disappeared before two newer- model planes could get airborne, the article said. While China's racy tabloids often run stories of strange phenomena, UFO reports are seldom car- ried by more official papers like the Hebei Daily. Massachusetts AUBURN-Witness reports he had a sighting on Nov. 14, 1998, at 9:02 a.m. He and five other wit- nesses saw a small pink ball circling the morning sky. \"It was unlike anything we have ever seen. It started circling slow, then faster until it shot away into the dis- tance. We heard a low humming noise, then a sharp screech. It left a blue streak that quickly disappeared. We took numerous photos, but have not developed them.\" Thanks lo Larry Clark, clark@ibm net, http:// www.nymufon org, and Jonathan, Ratsnake8@aol com. 832-8577. Georgia ATLANTA-Tom Sheets, our MUFON State Director, reports activity has increased. A local resi- dent contacted the Atlanta Journal inquiring to whom they could report a UFO. The witness claims he and his wife saw a gray isosceles triangle-shaped craft on Oct. 15,1998, near Kennesaw Mountain. At 12:30 p.m. the craft quickly flew to the north and changed its shape to that of a disc before vanishing. Mike Hitt found the article. Upon speaking to the witness' husband, Mike stated that they were still undecided about cooperat- ing with the investigation. Initial findings were that the two are professionals with good reputations. DALTON—Assistant State Director Mark Ausmus developed information on a video-taped light in the southwestern sky on Nov. 4, 1998. He traveled to Dalton and interviewed the witness and saw his video tape. The video indicated a large glowing orb about 1/4 the size of the full moon hovering in the southwest sky shortly after midnight. It appeared to be slightly elongated, giving off varying colors and appearing highly unusual to both Ausmus and Tom Sheets. Mark is currently analyzing the data gathered from the wit- ness and the video against astronomical charts, celes- tial bodies, and any possible artifacts or defects in the video camera. This is the most spectacular aberrant footage in this investigator's experience. DAHLONEGA-On Nov. 8, 1998, a college degreed medical specialist was commuting to his place of employment on the north side of Atlanta. As he drove south on Highway 400 near the Dawson/Forsythe County line, he noticed a group of cylinder-shaped ob- jects fly down in front of his truck. They began a se- ries of darting movements directly over the roadway. He was shaken by this event and slowed his speed. He was able to observe the activity closely at about 6 a.m. despite some rainy weather and fog. He stated he saw 30 to 40 dark colored objects, cylinder-shaped and 16\" by 6\" in size. They continued this activity for ten min- utes in front of his truck, getting as close as twenty feet away and as low to the pavement as six to twelve feet. He also noticed six or seven round white lights in the overcast sky performing similar maneuvers, \"like bees swarming.\" He stated that the lights were about as bright as vehicle headlights and about the size of 1 1/2 inches in diameter held at arm's length. He contin- ued south until the objects were no longer visible.

Mr. Hall's comment, \"he threat- ened to do various things to me,\" regarding a personal communication between him and Dr. Phillip Duke, was a hot iron on the wrong ironing board. It makes one wonder what nerve was struck with Mr. Hall to gener- ate such an acidic response to someone trying to help MUFON expand its professionalism. For the record, Dr. Duke did submit \"his claims to appropriate MUFON advisors for analysis.\" The point in fact of the whole matter is that had anyone else at MUFON taken time, beside Dr. Phillip Duke, to correllate MUFON sighting records, missing time, abductions, and compared (by color keyed pins) those maps with demographic maps of the AIDS pandemic, they would have found scary correlations between the UFO phenomena and the spread of AIDS. In my considered preliminary opinion, because all the data is not yet in, Dr. Duke may have hit on something here, folks. The maps are not completed yet, but patterns regarding abduction cases, UFO sightings worldwide the past 40 years, sex of the per- sons, whether they were pregnant, their overall health condition, dates, geographical locations, and compari- sons with the recent posting of the World Health web site on the AIDS spread worldwide is something con- clusive we should all take a very serious look at (on real maps) before we discard someone as credible as Dr. Phillip Duke. Had Mr. Hall taken time to check the creden- tials of Dr. Duke and penned a letter to MU FON mem- bers in Omaha, I believe he would have read the ar- ticle by Dr. Duke and his letter in a bit different pos- ture. Throughout the MUFON organization there are, have been, and will continue to be assumptions, sec- ond generation heresay, people bearing false witness, and personalities that conflict. I believe Mr. Hall took an unfortunate stance. Dr. Duke may or may not have to share blame here, but do any of us have a copy of the letter? So, should we take Mr. Richard Hall's word for it ? He was threatened? I really don't care. If there is an AIDS-UFO connection, then we must find that out in any manner avialable to us. As for being the \"Dean of UFO researchers,\" Mr. Hall set a bad example for the rest of us by the manner in which he chose to handle the issue with Dr. Duke. Cordially, Harry A.

In January, 1998, I resigned as a director of Quest International and UFO Magazine in order to pursue my own investigations into the UFO phenom- enon. This I have continued to do with all means at my disposal, and can state categorically that I have no in- tention of retiring or withdrawing from the subject.

However, after the information is filtered through the abductee, it is then filtered again through the \"re- searcher,\" \"hypnotist,\" \"ufologist,\" or whomever wants our information. If abductees have conscious recall of their experiences, they are critiziced by top research- ers. If abductees remember their experiences with the use of hypnosis, they are critiziced by still others. Before abduction cases and the valuable infor- mation they have brought to our understanding of the UFO are placed on ihe proverbial back burner, I would like to offer a suggestion: perhaps it is time for \"scien- tific\" studies involving the physiology of abductees. With the number of medical professionals associated with MUFON, many should question why this has not been attempted. Something as simple as having a labo- ratory where abductees could provide blood and urine"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal December 1998 Page 15 samples the morning after (or immediately after) an abduction. Comparing this data to a non-abductee population-or simply with the abductees' baseline read- ings-might provide us with some clues as to what is going on. For example, changes in the level of brain neuro-transmitters, adrenalin, and other hormones-and the detection of drugs in the bloodstream-would at least show that \"something\" occurred to the individual. Many abduclees have described being injected with drugs that knock them out or paralyze them dur- ing their abduction. Some remember being given a liq- uid to drink or something odd to eat just prior to losing consciousness. Why not look for the drug responsible for this type of physiological reaction? What if we find a substance never before detected in a human's blood- stream? What if we find a terrestrial drug like Scapolamine? Either of these results would, at the very least, rattle some nerves-and more importantly, sup- port or refute the victim's memory. These are events that studying abduction cases have taught us. Abductees are often \"drugged\" by their captors Let us be scientific and find out what they are being drugged with. Not all \"aliens\" wave a magic wand or j whispy hand to subdue their victims. Yes, it will cost money, but there is plenty of money in the ufological community: the Fund for UFO Research, MUFON, CUFOS, National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS), and Program for Extraor- dinary Experience Research (PEER)-all could fund a portion of a study as important as this. The latter two (NIDS and PEER) are probably more equipped than anyone to carry out such an undertaking. If those studying all that ufology encompasses really want to come together in unity, then let us unify. Truth and science does not need to be filtered. It lays bare to those willing to look at it. Blood and urine don't lie. Why not give it a try? Katharina Wilson kwilson@alienjigsaw.com A testable theory of UFOs... Editor's Note: Dick Hall sent an advance copy of his column in this month's Journal to Dr. Vaughn. Following is Dr. Vaughn's response: Dear Mr. Hall, Thank you for your letter in reference to my article, \"A Testable Theory of UFOs...\" as critiqued for the December MUFON UFO Journal. You state, \"I am challenging your data base in the Journal.... Your piece particularly cites 73 sightings for the period 1957-1977 that meet your criteria...The 1966-1968 sighting wave probably was the most gi- gantic one on record, and contained hundreds, if not thousands, of high-grade cases.\" Mr. Hall, the criteria for selection were not my criteria. They were the criteria of the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS), who sifted through a database of 60,000 cases at the request of J. S. Acetta for a report in the Journal of UFO Studies 20 years ago. Accetta analyzed the result-73 cases-and I analyzed those same 73 cases. Below is the text as I submitted it to the Jour- nal: Perhaps our best sighting data are multiple- witness UFO sighting dates published 20 years ago in a report that inspected the sighting dates and times tor possible geophysical effects.\" A database of 60,000 UFO reports was sifted to obtain 73 with precise re- porting times, multiple-witnesses, long duration, and other criteria. The 73 sightings (1957-1977) had been carefully reviewed by a committee of the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS). Our analysis showed that a significant number of the sighting periods-70% (11% above chance)-had negative geomagnetic shifts from the day before. \"J. S. Accetta, \"A Search for Possible Causal Associations Between UFOs & Perturbations in Re- corded Geophysical Data,\" Journal of UFO Studies (old series) 2, (1978), pp. 72-88. So you will have to challenge CUFOS, not me, if the database for 1957-1977 is not to your liking. However, I am delighted that your book UFO Evidence, Volume II, is due out soon and can provide even more high-quality UFO sighting data.

With such a small data base, it is a very weak argument. I think your experimental study is well worth undertaking, and hope that you do study a much larger data base. It was my intention to point out that the potential data base is many orders greater than most people realize, granting that it is not yet very readily available for study."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Page 16 December 1998 MUFON UFO Journal Ufolouv Profile Ted Phillips: top physical trace researcher Ted Phillips By Lhvight Connelly After 15 years of inactivity, the foremost physi- cal trace researcher in the world is back on the job. 1 first met Ted Phillips 25 years ago when 1 edited Skylook (former name of the MUFON UFO Journal} and Ted was a columnist.

His first contact with an ac- tual witness came through his father, a musician, who introduced him to Bob Younger, a radio station techni- cian. Younger described his experience on a night bombing run during World War II in which a large un- known object flew over and under the plane, rocking the aircraft. Younger noted that the whole bomber complement had observed it. \"I was really impressed,\" says Ted, \"and I even looked him up years later in Florida.\" International cases Ted's involvement with the Vanguard Satellite program through the National Astronomical League re- sulted in his hearing UFO reports from around the world. Around 1963 he began to look into specific reports. \"I was really fortunate to fall into some reallv good cases,\" he recalls. \"I was definitely hooked.\" The real involve- ment, however, came as a result of seeing Dr. J. Allen Hynek, professor of astronomy at Northwestern Uni- versity, give a TV news conference regarding a Michi- gan sighting. \"He was blaming everything on swamp gas,\" says Ted. \"I went through the roof. I fired off a three-page letter to him. It was really smoking. What really surprised me was that I received a four-page reply, explaining that he had been in town only 20 minutes before the news conference was scheduled, and that he had to give the explanation in order to keep his foot in the door with the Air Force as a con- sultant \" Ted adds, \"Allen told me later that he al- ways regretted doing this.\" A Skylook veteran In 1967, Skylook was founded by John Farrell Kuhns and Norma Short, with Phillips serving as as- sistant editor. Walt Andrus, John Schuessler, and Lou Parish were also involved with the publication. Two years later, when MUFON was founded and Skylook became its official publication, Phillips continued on the staff. In 1968 he investigated what he considers one of the better landing cases More than $600 damage was done to a camp sue, and a daylight photo of the object was taken. However, the witness would allow no publicity. Phillips called Dr. Hynek, who assisted with the case and the evaluation of the negatives. \"That was some case,\" says Phillips. \"The witness is now in a fairly high position, and still wants no pub- licity.\" Even more important than the case, from Phillips' perspective, was the opportunity to actually work with Dr. Hynek. \"I immediately loved the guy,\" says Phillips. A visit with the Hyneks That same year, Phillips and his wife Ginger were invited to Evanston, IL, home of Northwestern University, to visit the Hyneks. \"This was sort of like an interview,\" explains Phillips. \"Even though I was an engineer with the Missouri Department of High- ways, I felt like I was just a kid. Bill Powers, Fred Beckman, and Allen did the questioning. A couple of days after we returned home to Missouri, Allen asked if I wanted to join the group.\" In 1969, Hynek suggested to Phillips that ufologists should specialize, much as the medical pro- fession had done. \"He asked me what I would like to specialize in,\" recalls Phillips \"We talked about ra- dar cases, but they were too hard (o get. Humanoid cases in 1969 were still pretty ifly He suggested I specialize in landing cases, and 1 agreed. Of course, 1 would have jumped off a building if he had asked me to.\" Several months later, Phillips gave what he terms his \"first major talk\" at the first MUFON UFO"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal December 1998 Page 17 conference, held at Bradley University in Peoria, IL .\" It was not easy,\" Phillips recalls. \"In the front row were Allen, Coral Lorenzen, Walt Andrus and some other big names in ufology. Fortunately, I did have something to talk about. I had compiled 57 trace cases, which was colossal for the time. I think even J. Allen was surprised. Pretty good for a punk kid. Now, in 1998,1 have more than 4,100 ground trace cases, and this is actually low, because I'm just now catching up on the late 1980's and the 1990 V Travels with J. Allen Hynek It was during this period of time that Phillips and Dr. Hynek began traveling and lecturing together throughout the country. \"We became not only col- leagues, but really close friends,\" says Phillips. \"He was not a self-promoter, but he always promoted me. When he got invited to lecture, he would bring me along and share the podium.\" Phillips, who is a part-time professional musi- cian, tells of the time he and Ginger were invited to Chicago by Dr. Hynek to hear Buddy Rich, Ted's fa- vorite drummer, who was playing at Mr. Kelly's. \"The day before we were to leave for Chicago, there had been a landing case at Columbia, MO,\" explains Ted. \"That was on our way to Chicago, so I stopped and investigated, shot photos, took samples, interviewed witnesses, and so on. When we got to Chicago I was able to share this hot case with Buddy Rich, whose second love after music was UFOs. We were both thrilled.\" Later, Phillips mentioned to Dr. Hynek how nice it was of Buddy Rich to give him a set of his drum- sticks, \"and I said that the only thing better would have been if he had given me a set he had used. Rich was brutal on drum sticks. Two weeks later a battered pair of drum sticks appeared in the mail. That's the kind of guy Allen was.\" Both Phillips and Dr. Hynek were kept ex- tremely busy handling new cases, promoting the Cen- ter, and trying to educate the public about UFOs. \"It was just incredible,\" says Phillips. \"We were just bur- ied in cases. There were also CUFOS meetings with Jacques Vallee, Dave Saunders, Claude Poher, Bob Wood, and others. We also worked with the AIAA UFO Subcommittee, led by Peter Sturrock. We had too much to do, and too few resources. We couldn't properly do every case, even the good ones.\" He notes that a trip to Hynek's third-floor office at his home required walk- ing past stacks of case reports on the stairway. \"He called it his vertical file,\" recalls Phillips. Editing Physical Traces InJulyof 1975, Phillips compiled—andMimi Hynek edited— Physical Traces Associated with UFO Sightings for the Center. A total of 831 reports were listed, including 561 in connection with an object or light, 154 where no object or light was observed, and 116 in which details were not available. Visits by the Hyneks Each year Dr. Hynek and Mimi would stop by the Phillips home in Missouri before going to their cabin in Canada. In 1985, during what was to be the last such visit, Ted could tell that something was wrong. \"Allen had trouble remembering things,\" he explains, \"and he couldn't come up with the words he wanted to use. He asked, 'What's wrong with me?' I think he sensed it was something serious, because he wanted to go out to the cottage and just talk about some of the best cases, and what still needed to be done. He wanted me to go back to the Delphos, K.S, case. Three weeks later they found the brain tumor. Later he seemed to get better. Then he suddenly died. It was a terrible shock. It was like losing my best friend and my father at the same time. I just didn't want to go on doing research without him.\" Mimi scattered Dr. Hynek's ashes at their be- loved cabin in Canada, and continued to stop by the Phillips home for visits up until the time she also died. Following Dr. Hynek's death, Phillips entered a pe- riod of depression which took years to overcome. \"Ginger, who has an interest in this area of medicine, finally found a doctor in Branson who did me some good,\" says Ted. \"Then she reminded me that I had more or less promised Allen I would go back to some of the better cases, such as Delphos. She also got me on the Internet, where 1 was able to not only renew acquaintances, but also make a lot of new contacts.\" In returning to the field, Ted finds that little has been done in this country during the past 15 years with physical traces. \"When I tell one of our younger enthusiasts that I study physical traces, the response is usually, 'What is that?'\" says Ted, smiling. Return to Delphos Naturally, one of the first cases that Ted has already returned to is Delphos. \"It was a good case already,\" he observes, \"but now I have the chance to go back and again interview those involved, as well as make comparisons with other cases in this country and around the world.\" Ted recalls that on his first trip to the Delphos site in 1971 he collected 14 pounds of soil from the ring area in half-inch increments. He also collected 16 pounds of samples from the flight path of the object and from control sample areas. \"Phil Klass criticized me for supposedly not taking control samples,\" says Ted. \"All he had to do was ask. It would be stupid not to do that. The flight path samples can also be very important, especially if they show a change in some element as the object (Continued on Page 20)"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Page 18 December 1998 MUFON UFO Journal Richard Hall Richard H. Hall On the November Issue of the Journal The article by Eve Frances Lorgen on alleged implants raises an important issue. People with her type of qualifications are badly needed in the field, and her interview data is of definite interest. However, no mean- ingful science will be done until the reported pathol- ogy reports and laboratory analyses are made available for peer review. Secret science is an oxymoron, and Robert Bigelow's National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS) is notoriously secretive. The sci- entific reports are helpful in educating all of us on the ^tate of human implant technology We should always be looking for real science and technology and its potential applications to ufology. True believers probably will be bored, but that's too bad. It is important for them to pay atteni ion 10 (he MUFON mission statement on the Contents 1'jge \"systematic collection and analysis...\" The Art Bell piece makes me think about how the sociological aspects of the UFO movement distract from the physical science aspects. News media glee- fully report on colorful personalities, the more para- noid the better, but where is their reporting on the po- tentially important airline pilot sightings of the past few years? Obviously, Bell is viewed by the media as rep- resentative of the UFO field, even as a guru for ufologists. Well, count me out. Let's stick to facts, logic, and science. The \"testable theory\" purporting to link UFOs with other offbeat phenomena needs to be carefully scrutinized by MUFON consultants with appropriate credentials. I dispute Mr. Vaughan's data base when he states that UFOs were not reported during times of high geomagnetic activity, dates which I don't find clearly identified in his article. His 224 sighting dates is a pitifully small sample, given the many thousands of UFO reports on record. I have far more than 73 re- ports which meet his criteria for 1957-1977. The Sept. 9,1998, pilot sighting repon is a good start, and the case ought to be investigated further. However, since the object did nothing UFO-like and sounds suspiciously like some kind of a natural phe- nomenon, we shouldn't automatically be thinking that it was a UFO-except very tentatively. This has always been a terminologial problem, and Bruce Maccabee has suggested using TRUFO (true UFO) for cases that remain unexplained after thorough investigation. In any event, we should be aware of the distinction between a raw report and a UFO that deserves to be considered part of the evidence for a real, unexplained phenom- enon. With Pine Bush, we return to sociological phe- nomena, as the author acknowledges, and people with weird beliefs who always make colorful copy. How much light this sheds on the real UFO mystery is prob- lematical. My conclusion, after many years of experi- ence, is that it obfuscates and confuses the real issues, and merely gives skeptics ammunition to debunk the subject. The teletype or other message held by Gen- eral Ramey in the Roswell period photograph deserves careful analysis. But it won't be credible unless checked, or duplicated, by analysts who have not staked out a position on the Roswell case. Indepen- dent study by neutral analysts is greatly to be desired. We already see evidence suggesting that some people are \"reading into\" the message what they would like to see. The MUFON Forum remains an important medium for constructive dialogue, the letters in this issue being good examples. Keep those sensible cards and letters coming! MUFON is fortunate to have an experienced journalist, as well as someone with a longstanding in- terest in the subject, as editor. Those of you who may have been critical of the content of the Journal in the past (I used to get complaints too!) should consider contributing an article or writing a letter for publica- tion, especially those of you who advocate conserva- tive and scientific ufology. Where there is a vacuum, another breed of \"ufologists\" tends to rush in. Thought for the month: As my father used to say, \"It takes all kinds of people to make a world.\" The MUFON membership no doubt includes people of many different backgrounds and belief systems. But the unifying factor should be an agreement to expose falsehoods and fraud, study data carefully, don't make gratuitous assumptions, and don't leap to conclusions. We can honestly and conscientiously disagree about details."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal December 1998 Page 19 The UFO PRESS ' Dwight Connelly The Aliens and the Scalpel by Dr Roger K. Leir, Forward by Whitley Strieber. Granite Publishing, LLC, P.O. Box 1429, Columbus, NC 28722. 231 pgs. Case bound $24.95; perfect bound, $18.95. Reviewed by Dwight Connelly Of the many UFO books being published these days, this one should be on your \"must buy\" list. As Budd Hopkins notes, Dr. Leir's \"carefully documented surgical removal of possible alien implants from individu- als reporting UFO abductions can no longer be ignored.\" While the book does not include much information on the implants themselves that has not already been cov- ered in the Journal, it does provide the background needed in order to more prop- erly judge and understand Dr. Leir's important work. This is, in fact, as much a story about Dr. Leir as it is about implant removal surgery. The good doc- tor has a talent for writing which is detailed, percep- tive, introspective, informative, and just plain enjoy- able to read. Granted, there is too much detail about unimportant things at times, but even this tells us some- thing about Dr. Leir. (His article in this issue of the Journal provides a good sample of his writing style.) I have never met Dr. Leir, nor even talked with him by phone, so my entire impression of him has come from his writings. He comes across as an honest, sin- cere, genuinely nice individual. He reveals things about himself that are important in judging who he is and what he is doing, but which will probably not endear him to the average mainstream scientist. 1 refer to such revelations as his near-death experiences, dream/en- counter with ET, and his conclusion that aliens are cur- rently manipulating human genetics. Unfortunately, these types of things give mainstream scientists an easy excuse to write him off without investigting what he has done. Another problem Dr. Leir has with credibility is his close association with Derrel Sims, who serves as partner, advisor, coordinator, hypnoanesthesiologist, and personal friend. Rightly or wrongly, justly or un- justly, Sims is not held in high regard by a large num- ber of ufologists, much less the scientific community. Dr. Leir, for example, receives invitations to speak be- fore groups which refuse to invite Sims. This is frus- irating to Dr. Leir, who feels that Sims, who he met three years ago, is a legitimate and important partner i n their organization, the Fund for Interactive Research in Space Technology (F.I.R.S.T.). Is the UFO commu- nity being unreasonable in regard to Sims, or is Dr. Leir being taken for a ride by his charismatic partner? Time, as they say, will tell. Also of little help in establishing credibility is the association of Sims and Dr. Leir with a piece of material which supposedly came from a UFO crash at Roswell. Although Dr. Russell VemonClark, then with the University of California, San Diego, supposedly verified that the material contained extraterrestrial iso- topes and, in Dr. Leir's words, \"was not made on this Earth,\" a great deal of confusion and controversy sur- rounds this item, as Dr. Leir notes in his book. He and Sims have also had limited association with Santilli's alleged \"alien autopsy\" film. This unnecessary and ill-advised involvement with high-profile-but highly questionable-\"finds\" can only detract from needed credibility for the implant removal project. This is a shame, because the implant removal surgery itself is reasonably well documented and has at least provided something tangible that can be duplicated or refuted. Another questionable relationship in the minds of some ufologists is the association of Dr. Leir with Robert Bigelow, The Bigelow Foundation, and Bigelow's National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS). The mutual endeavors of Dr. Leir and Bigelow are discussed in the book, and seem to be simply a matter of Dr. Leir going where the research money is. The most frequent complaint about Bigelow is that he gathers information, but will not share it. Ironically, Dr. Leir notes that Bigelow wanted to release some of the scientific data regarding metal- lurgy tests on the implants to the MUFON UFO Jour- nal early on, but Dr. Leir-who has a positive relation- ship with MUFON-asked him not to do this. \"The research was not complete,\" explains Dr. Leir, \"and I did not want to be in a position of being forced into premature conclusions. Another reason was that I wanted to personally write an article for the Journal that would not only present the findings, but also the background on the research itself. The article finally appeared in the April 1996 issue, and it was widely read and commented on.\" Also of interest is the fact that Leir's book was published under the auspices of The Bigelow Founda- tion and NIDS, so apparently Bigelow is not hoarding ALL the information which he has helped obtain through his research grants. Political issues aside, Dr. Leir provides a blow- by-blow, extremely detailed account of how he got in- volved with ufology, his work with the Santa Barbara/"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Page 20 December 1998 MUFON UFO Journal Ventura MUFON group, personal UFO-related expe- riences, becoming acquainted with Sims and Strieber, setting up the implant surgeries, performing the sur- geries, frustrations with getting the removed materials tested, and continued problems in obtaining funding. Color and black & white photos are included, as are actual reports on testing the removed material by various labs. An index would have been a nice ad- dition, but considering that Dr. Leir finished the book in August and it was published in November, there probably was no( enough time to compile an index. The biggest question left unanswered is what these implants are supposed to do, assuming they were placed by aliens. While the materials removed are very unusual in many ways, there is nothing like transistors or computer chips visible. While some are very much alike, some are quite different. Dr. Leir is as puzzled as anyone else, conclud- ing, \"It would seem that the recovered items are struc- tured objects that serve an as-yet undetermined pur- pose.\" Even so, he says that \"most of the metallurgi- cal analysis indicates that the structure of these ob- jects has an extraterrestrial origin. The composition of the objects includes metals whose isotopic ratios are clearly not from Earth. Moreover, the form of these objects is clearly engineered and manufactured with precision rather than being a naturally occurring form. If these scientifically derived results are not disproven by subsequent analysis, then we can firmly conclude that some individuals with alien abduction histories have artificially manufactured objects in their bodies of a demonstrably exrraterrstial origin. In short, we now have the 'smoking gun' of ufology-hard, physi- cal, scientific evidence of a continuing alien presence.\" (As an aside, one could ask why implants-or even UFOs-would necessarily have to be made of ma- terials from beyond the Earth. Do aliens have to carry everything with them from their home planet?) What's next for Dr. Leir? \"We look forward,\" he says, \"to when we can arrange for the performance of surgical procedures in such countries as Brazil, En- gland, Mexico, Japan, Ecuador, Australia, and Puerto Rico.\" He notes that Sims also has the rather ambi- tious \"ultimate goal\" of \"actually capturing one or more of these elusive beings that are entering our environ- ment.\" Is this book the last word on surgical removal and testing of possible alien implants? Hopefully not. Dr. Leir and Sims have led the way. Now there is a need for respected professionals and organizations to cany out additional research to see if similar results are forthcoming, to analyse what is found, and, of course, to write books about it. One can only hope they will be as interesting as this one. Ted Phillips... (Continued from Page 17) moves to or from the area.\" Ted, a quiet, unassuming individual, describes his approach to ufology as \"conservative,\" saying that he has been criticized for not saying that UFOs are extraterrestrial. \"I simply have no proof of what they are,\" he explains, \"but I certainly wouldn't rule that out. I think I am cautious publicly because of working with Allen so long. He had to constantly worry about credibility, but privately he was interested in a lot of different theories.\" As noted, Ted is not only revisiting key older cases, but also aggressively gathering information on current cases. He recently traveled to Iowa to work with Beverly Trout, MUFON state director for Iowa, and Daryl Stangl, assistant state director for Iowa, on a physical trace case. In order to do the type of job that needs to be done, Phillips needs not only the cooperation of inves- tigators in notifying him quickly of landing cases, but also the funds to travel to these sites and to purchase some key equipment. He has received limited grant money, but this is only the beginning of what is needed for investigating, analyzing, organizing, and getting the cases out to other researchers. \"I'm willing to put in the time and effort,\" says Phillips, \"but I can't afford to finance it.\" Filer's Files...

Webb January 1999 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Venus (-3.9) reappears in the evening sky but is very low in the WSW at dusk, setting 1 1/2 hours after sunset in mid-month. The lunar crescent appears below Venus on the 18th and above it on the 19th. Jupiter (-2.2), moving from Aquarius to Pisces, can be seen in the SW at twilight, later setting in the W about 9:30 (mid-January). The crescent Moon slides between the big world and Venus on Jan. 20 and then moves close below Jupiter the next evening Saturn (0.3), in Pisces, stands hiyh in the.S at dusk and advances westward. The lun.ir descent lies below Saturn on the 23rd. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars (0.8), in Virgo, rises in the E about mid- night in mid-month and arrives in the S at dawn. The red planet is near the quarter Moon on Jan. 9 and can be found 4 degrees above the star Spica on the 12th. Saturn sets in the W shortly after midnight. Rare Penumbral Lunar Eclipse: At dawn on Jan. 31 the month's 2nd full moon slips completely into the faint outer shadow (penum- bra) of the Earth to create a rare total penumbral lunar eclipse. Greatest eclipse can be seen from Hawaii and the Pacific, although the western U.S. can see the first part of the event just before the Moon sets and the Sun rises. At its best the Moon is viewed squeezing wholly into the narrow penumbral shadow without touching the darker central umbral portion. Hawaiian observers especially should perceive a darkened Moon at 6:17 a.m. (greatest eclipse). Space Observatory Launch: This month the shuttle is scheduled to launch into far earth orbit the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility (AXAF). Joining the Hubble Space Telescope as a major space observatory, AXAF will study vio- lent events in the universe in x-rays, such as colliding galaxies, supernova explosions, black holes, and pul- sars. Moon Phases: Full moon-Jan. 1 Last quarter-Jan. 9 New moon-Jan. 17 First quarter-Jan. 24 Full moon-Jan. 31 O C O There are two full moons this month (also in March). The second full moon is called a \"blue moon.\" The last time this occurred was in June, 1996. The Stars: During the mid-evening hours the heavens of January feature an array of some of the brightest stars seen from northern latitudes. Orion the Hunter domi- nates the southern sky and is one of the easiest of all constellations to visualize. Note the patch of light in the starry sword that dangles from the Hunter's belt (3 stars in a row). The fuzzy spot is the Orion Nebula, a feast of beauty in binoculars and even more so in a telescope. The glow- ing cloud of gas and dust cradles at its center a stellar nursery where new stars are bom.

FUNDS NEEDED FOR MUFON UFO MUSEUM In 1994, when the Bigelow Foundation was providing financial help to all three members of the UFO Research Coalition, MUFON obligated itself to initiate specific new programs that we could not have financed otherwise. One of these was the MUFON UFO INFORMATION CENTER AND MUSEUM located in an office complex on the main north-south highway Bypass 123 through Seguin, TX. This is a separate facility only a few blocks from MUFON's business office at 103 Oldtowne Road. The fundamental purpose of the \"UFO Infor- mation Center\" was public education for the general public and media, as well as UFO enthusiasts. It is the only UFO museum in the United States east of Roswell, NM. MUFON members from coast to coast and bor- der to border have visited the museum, including visi- tors from eight different countries. We do not charge admission, but solicit donations only. Obviously, the donations do not cover the monthly rent of $350 for the 500-square-foot facility. After the museum was assembled in 1994, Bob Bigelow abruptly withdrew his financial support in July 1995, leaving MUFON with an additional expenditure that exceeds our annual budget. Even though our in- formation center and museum is very attractive and popular, it does not approach the tens of thousands of people that tour the International UFO Museum and Research Center in Roswell, NM, and the resulting donations. Over the years MUFON has received dona- tions that are I.R.S, tax deductible for the donor in their annual income tax report. These gifts are very much appreciated; however, they are far from adequate to cover the annual rent of $4200 for the museum. MUFON has never before in its nearly thirty years of operation solicited funds from our members to support projects. In order to keep the doors open at our mu- seum, so as to continue to educate the public, we are taking this opportunity to ask for donations. Those of you who have visited our museum recognize its importance and the unique displays. We have had photographs in the MUFON UFO Journal for those of you who haven't had the privilege of see- ing this one-of-a-kind unique display. The MUFON office acknowledges all donations or gifts of any size with a letter that you can attach as evidence to your annual income tax statement. If you want to see our UFO Information Cen- ter and Museum continue to share its displays, exhib- its, and photographs with people interested in learning more about the UFO phenomenon, this is your oppor- tunity to step forward and make a generous gift con- sistent with your financial status.

R. Gillis (Gulfport) be promoted to State Director. Mr. Gillis selected Wayne E. Morgan (Hernando) to be his as- sistant State Director for Mississippi. The State Director for Texas, Ellen R.

NOMINATIONS FOR WESTERN REGIONAL DIRECTOR The term of Mrs. Marilyn H. Childs, M.S. (Bothell, WA) as the Western Regional Director will expire in 1999. Marilyn and her husband Larry pro- vided the leadership for the very successful MUFON 1995 UFO Symposium in Seattle, WA. Through her many contacts, Marilyn has been instrumental in pro- moting MUFON in the public education arena. She will not run for a second term because of the need to be gainfully employed again. MUFON will regretfully miss her talent on the Board of Directors. Candidates for this important Board of Directors posi- tion could be past or present State Directors, Assistant State Directors, or State Section Directors, where they have secured leadership training within the MUFON organization. Potential nominations could also come from individuals who feel they are qualified and inter- ested in serving MUFON and their fellow members in this vital capacity.
