It is this writer's sincere belief-that, when all the hoaxes, misidentifications, and misconceptions are proven to be such-eventually, we will find that the true UFO will prove to be a metallic-structured object. Where they are from,.why they are here, and how they got here-is pure conjecture at this time. Philip Klass has run the gamut in explaining away UFO's as being one thing-and, then, another. We have him to thank, however, .for showing that all too ,often the \"experienced\" investigator leaves much to be desired- and that we, oftimes, do not .properly investigate the reports. However, even Dr.-Hynek has offered varied opinions down through his UFO years- sometimes drifting from one extreme to another. Dr. Hynek warrants accolades, however, since he has added a degree of authority, officialdom, and the voice of a scientist to UFO investigations. These differences in opinions may be healthy when evaluating .UFO reports. It shows/too, that regardless of who we are (or think we are), we are entitled to change our minds and offer varying explanations-oftimes contrary to each other. Thus, we should bear in mind that none of us may be completely right-and, in like manner, completely wrong. A disturbing aspect to this writer, however, is when some of our \"leaders\" begin considering third dimensions, psychic projections, and other matters that belong to occult- oriented material and persons. Make no mistake about it-l do not care what your interest may be in either field-UFO's and the Occult (and I differentiate between the two)-there is not one documented, scientifically investigated, case of any type of psychic projection. To honestly believe that a person can, through thought projection, place an object- which appears to be real and solid- before the eyes of several others-is a matter of sheer'nonsense. There is no way that there has ever been) or -ever will be, any object projected beyond the inner mind, and skull, of an individual-to an outward, position where the \"conceived\" object may be viewed by others. I know of which I speak-and I have, in the past, openly challenged any alleged psychic, occultist, medium, or clairvoyant, to project before me, or have projected before me, any type of object, creature, or person-and have them appear and/or disapper before me. Just recently, I have again placed such a challenge before a meeting of some of the alleged leading \"psychics\". I know that you may have read about such , experiences-and some-one. will say that I do not know what I am talking about-and that such experiences have been documented and. I say to them - \"hogwash\". It may be true that you have read about such, but that does not make them true. Anyplace you would have read, about them would, again, be in sensationalist material-none of which have any factual foundation. From my latest challenge, if I should find that | am in .error, and am wrong-you will be among the first to, ;read of my acknowledgement of such-and with a full report as to my findings. MUFON members-persons primarily concerned about the occult, for the most part, could not care less whether or not UFO's are real. UFO's, to them,! offer just another fanciful venture to another Alice in Wonderland. I was amused over a little.dissertation following the Fort Smith Conference-as persons were departing the Motel-a person known to most of you, was discussing \"psyhic projections of craft\" with Philip Klass. In endeavoring to wind-up a \"friendly disagreement\", Klass told them that he would be open- minded-that if the other person could conjure-up a psychic-projected vehicle to get him to the airport-he would be more than willing to ride in it. That, my friends, is being practical. We may want to believe that things like this could happen-but that does not make it \"so\". Thus, I submit to the leaders of the various UFO organizations and their investigators, that they not place any undue emphasis on the matter of occult and psychic- projected UFO's. These will continue to be written about in the newsstand publications, but they are not a part of the good reports worthy of scientific thought, nor serious investigations. To those persons becoming involved in such trivia, you will soon find that those proposing such matters are not interested in whether or not UFO's are real-but other matters not even though provoking. To those UFO Investigators, and our UFO Scientists, trying to solve the mystery of the UFO-you will not find the answer among the occults-you .are wasting your time. Read about, and .even investigate psychic phenomena-if you will-but do not let it bog us down in UFO investigations when more important, and real, issues may be nearer at hand. Separate the two-and let them fall where they may rightfully belong, but joining hands is an entrapment, which could take the serious investigator around the \"bend\" from normalcy.

Typ» of lighting! daylight cloM •nmintor. This sighting was first brought to my attention on Friday, April 23,1976 by a student in my general botany class at the University of Wisconsin-River Falls. He and a friend had intercepted one or more of George Wheeler's radio transmissions, concerning a UFO, to the Pierce County sheriff's office in Ellsworth, Wisconsin. This had occurred the previous night (Thursday, April 22,1976). I was particularly intrigued when George Wheeler's name was mentioned because it was just over one year ago (April 6, 1975) that Mr. Wheeler observed a UFO near the outskirts of Elmwood, Wisconsin. I had interviewed George concerning his sighting of April 6, 1975, and was convinced that he was a reliable witness and had experienced what he had described. It seemed unusual, however, that the same individual would experience another sighting in the same general area. I tried to contact George over the weekend and through Monday, April 26, but to no avail. On Tuesday, April 27,1976 George called me and briefly described his experience, it was then I learned that the reason I had not been able to contact him was that he had been in the hospital from Friday, April 23 until Tuesday, April 27,1976. I drove to Elmwood that afternoon to interview George concerning this latest UFO sighting. It was my impression that George was still a little unsteady from his experience. During our discussion he PAGE 14 GEORGE WHEELER INDICATING THE APPROXIMATE POSITION UFO OBSERVED ON THURSDAY EVENING, APRIL 22, 1976. OF mentioned that he had been informed, second hand, that Mr. Paul Fredrickson, administrator of the nursing home in Elmwood, had observed a light at the same time, in the same place and on the same night. George called Mr. Fredrickson and made arrangements for the two of us to visit with him. Mr. Fredrickson informed us that he had been telephoned by an individual at the nursing home, who was aware of the sighting in progress, and asked if he would go down to his porch and look toward the quarry on Tuttle Hill. Mr. Fredrickson lives approximately three- quarters of a mile from the quarry. When he looked toward the quarry from his porch he saw a \"difficult-to-describe\" brilliant orange light. Strange, he related, because of the color and the limited nature of it (i.e., it was not flickering and irregular in outline as would be the case if a building was burning, but, rather a steady, brilliant light). Knowing of his wife's interest in UFO phenomena he hurried to inform her of the incident. However, when they both returned to the porch the light was gone. Mr. Fredrickson's observation confirms Mr. Wheeler's sighting by place, time and color. However, from his vantage point Mr. Fredrickson was not able to discern a solid object-only the bright orange light. Next, George and I drove to the quarry on Tuttle Hill where he described in detail his ex- perience: \"When I got to the 1 top of Tuttle Hill there was this huge object that appeared to be about as high as a two-story house and about 250 feet across. It was about 500 feet away from me and about 100 feet off the ground, between the quarry and where the"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"old barn burned, as near as I could estimate. There was an orange-white light at the top and six bluish white lights on the side and I could see shadows as if something were moving inside it. In the middle of the side, there appeared to be a panel that was open and I could see something within it that appeared to be revolving slowly and had some fin-like parts on it. What appeared to be legs Of the craft were partially extended from the body arid there was a long, black hose-like appendage on the craft. It rose straight up, extremely fast and at this time there was a type of flash and my car lights went out, the radio went dead and the motor stop^ ped. I don't remember anymore until someone asked me if I needed help.\" A short distance away is the'L. O'Bryan farm. On the chance that they may have observed something on the night in question we stopped in and briefly visited with Mr. and Mrs. O'Bryan. We learned that Mrs. O'Bryan had gone to sleep before 11:00 P.M. that evening, but Mr. O'Bryan had been awake watching television. When we asked if he had seen or heard anything out of the ordinary that evening, he replied in the negative. However, he mentioned that his TV set had gone black that evening for a few seconds just after 11:00 P.M. Mr. O'Bryan could not remember the name pf the program he had been watching, but knew it was a few minutes after the program had started that his TV \"blacked out\". This would coincide with the time that Mr. Wheeler and his squad car were enveloped by the light from the UFO. On my second visit with Mr. O'Bryan (May 8,1976). I had a copy of the TV program schedule for Thursday, April 22, 1976 and he confirmed that he had been watching the Perry Mason show on Channel 11 which begins at 11:00 P.M. Mr. O'Bryan added that he had heard that one of the children in the family living on the next farm down the road had seen something on that evening. .The next farm down the road, but within sight of the O'Bryan farm and the quarry, is occupied by Mr. James Kuehl and family. George and I drove to the Kuehl farm and talked with Mrs. Kuehl and her children. Contrary to what Mr. O'Bryan had heard none of the Kuehl children had seen or heard anything strange that evening, nor had Mrs. Kuehl. Next, we went down to the barn to talk with Jim Kuehl. He related that he had not noticed, any thing unusual that night either. However, he did mention that his wife had come home from a meeting shortly after 11:00 P.M. that evening and noticed a peculiar change in behavior of their dogs. They have several dogs and some are rather young. Jim mentioned that his wife had remarked that the dogs had acted very peculiar when she arrived home that evening. Usually they come running and are jumping up on her when she comes home. On this evening none of the dogs came to her, but stayed at a distance and barked. She called to them and still they would not approach her. This was the only night the dogs ever exhibited such a change in their behavioral pattern. During the period May 3 : 8 J tried to contact George again, but could get no answer. On Saturday, May 8, I drove to Elmwood and found his wife, Doris, at home. She informed me that George had been in the hospital again that entire week. During that trip I visited with police officer, Gene Helmer and his wife. This discussion added little new information, but did corroborate what George had related to me about the incident. On Thursday, May 27, George and I discussed again various aspects of the case. George mentioned that he had talked on the phone with Mrs. Miles Wergland, Elmwood, who had seen the UFO that same evening while looking out a window of her home. We stopped at her home on Thursday, May 27, but no one was home. This appears to be an extraordinarily good sighting with various bits of confirming data; including two other persons who observed the UFO (at least the light from it) from separate vantage points.

Here is a small sample of some of the more interesting Scandinavian UFO cases within the past few years). A spectacular sighting by Danish police officer Evald Hansen Maarup August 13, 1975 has received wide attention in the Scandinavian press. Maarup was en route home in his police car at 10:50 p.m., driving between Kabdrup and Fjelstrup when the car was suddenly surrounded by bright bluish-white light and experienced' a total electrical failure. Shielding his eyes from the dazzling light, Maarup pulled to the side of the road and reached for his radio to call his station. The radio was also dead. He then noticed that the interior of the car was warming up as if from a hot summer sun. After a while Maarup noticed that the light, a cone with a diameter of 4-5 m, was rising, It came from a luminous hole in the bottom of a large gray object (about 10 m diameter) with two dome-like downward protrusions. Somewhere in the sequence he instinctively activated a mounted camera in the patrol car and took three pictures. A little later he took three more. After the cone of light vanished into the UFO, it began moving, accelerating rapidly and disappearing vertically upward PAGE 6 making no sound. When it left, the car started easily, the lights worked, and he reported the incident to the station on his radio. Maarup searched the area for traces but found nothing. He did note that the front mudguard still felt hot to the touch. The car was an almost new Ford Zodiac (6 cylinder) in good mechanical condition with no history of problems. When the film was developed, one frame showed an unexplained spot of light. The report and pictures were submitted to the Air Force, but no analysis report was released. (Credit: SUFOI, Soborg, Denmark). Professor Bertil Soderquist, Swedish Representative, has submitted brief summaries of a number of cases. (More details are available from him if desired by any MUFON specialists). February 22, 1975; Finnerodja, central Sweden--At 6:50 PM four witnesses observed a large, gray bus-shaped object at low altitude (40-50 m) when it moved slowly across the road ahead of their car. The UFO had three \"searchlights\" at the front and moved with no sound. A rear view, as it passed, revealed 9 staggered brightly illuminated openings. The object was about 30 m long, 20 m wide, and 3 m in height. March 18,1975; Agesta, central Sweden~A family saw five bright objects circle above a nearby nuclear power station about 8 PM. The first object seen was cigar- shaped; it was then joined by four additional bluish-white objects which circled around the cigar. As the father observed through binoculars, the four smaller objects disappeared suddenly, leaving smoke puffs. The cigar remained visible for five minutes before disappearing. In an earlier report from Tanndalen, northern Sweden, an unusual observation lasting l l /z hours was reported by two witnesses December 31, 1974. First seen at 5 PM, the brightly lit UFO changed shape from round to oblong, divided into, two objects, and emitted rays of light from time to time. When one of the witnesses shone a flashlight toward the UFO, the object approached and the witnesses fled in fear. A few days later the same or a similar object was seen by many others and photographs were taken, showing only a diffusely lit object. Astrid Svelmoe of the Norsk UFO Center, Trondheim, has forwarded a packet of 1974 cases translated into English for MUFON on Center report forms. One of the more interesting cases occurred on Dec. 31, 1974 at Dagali, Norway at about 7 PM. A dull red, faintly glowing ball-like object was observed moving slowly at low altitude (20-50 m above the hilly terrain) moving south, turning west and stopping at the end of a new airfield. The light suddenly flared into bright white. After about five seconds the object darkened again and moved away rapidly to the south- southeast through a gap in the Dagali Mountains. A short red tail was seen during motion."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"SEVENTH ANNUAL MUFON SYMPOSIUM by D. William Hauck WALT ANDRUS \"New Frontiers in UFO Resear- ch\" proved to be an appropriate theme at the Seventh Annual MUFON Symposium held June 12 and 13 at Weber Inn in Ann Arbor, Michigan and hosted by State Direc- tor Robert Stinson and University of Michigan sociologist Dr. Ronald Westrum. The emphasis on new frontiers was apparent from the beginning as Director Walt Andrus stressed continued support for the Center for UFO Studies, com- plemented with a rededication on the part of MUFON members to scientific ufology. The only program change was Jerome Clark's pitch-hitting for Jacques Valle. The co-author of- Unidentified presented a fascinating account of his personal investigation of the Sandy Larson (Fargo, North Dakota) humanoid case. Clark's threefold set of possible explanations for such abduction cases was: 1) The incidents take place in another reality, a combination of dream world and physical reality; 2) The incidents do not actually take place as recalled, being either phoney or implanted memories; and finally 3) The ufonauts are somehow limited in their power, thereby accounting for the, incomplete or utterly fantastic interpretations humans give to the events. JEROME CLARK DAVE WEBB Further insights into the study of humanoid reports were brought out by Dave Webb of the Humanoid Study Group. Analyzing the 1000 entity cases that the MUFON study group has accumulated, Webb found distinct correlations with Vallee's \"Law of the Times\", which states that there is a distinct preference for nighttime landing and extra- vehicular activity peaking between nine and ten in the evening. Similar correlation was found with Saun- ders' 61 month sightings wave pat- tern. Although these correlations must be borne out with a larger case population and more representative international . sampling, the preliminary findings promise significant advances from continued organization, computer coding, and eventual computer cataloging of humanoid encounters. . HENRY MCKAY Another result of UFO landings is of-course, physical traces, a subject ably presented by Henry McKay, Canadian Regional Director for MUFON. Not only does the in- vestigation of physical traces require a knowledge of such diverse disciplines as geology, meteorology, and chemistry, but also an un- derstanding of the effects of rare phenomena such as ball lightning and fairy-ring rungus. McKay's thorough on-the-site investigation of twelve Canadian \"UFO ring\" cases provided some fresh material in an PAGE 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"area of UFO research which has been beset with unscientific, delayed, and inadequate in- vestigation. Hopefully better analytical techniques and quicker response will enable ufologists to gather as much information as possible from the rare and extremely valuable physical trace cases. design can be used in a variety of dp- plications, since the majority of the equipment is completely mobile surface reflectivity can be easily in- terpreted and reprocessed in three- dimensional coordinates. ' RAY STANFORD Nowhere were new frontiers more evident than in the presentations on instrumented UFO research. Ray Stanford fired the enthusiasm of all present with Project Starlight's Operation ARGUS concept. Argus was a creature in Greek mythology with many eyes and the acronym seems quite appropriate (Automatic Ringup on Geolocated UFO Sightings). The new system feeds UFO data acquisitions from technician-operated telescopic cameras directly into a central com- puter, which then calculates and displays the UFO coordinates in- cluding distance, altitude, and size data. At the same time the computer selects a pre-recorded aerial photo (or map) and superimposes the path of the UFO on a video .screen. Automatically, the computer telephones volunteers within the visibility radius of the UFO and issues a general UFO alert over amateur and CB radio frequencies. With radar, recording magne- tometer and gravitometer, and previously installed UFO VEC- TOR laser monitoring equipment, any UFO event occurring within range of the Project Starlight laboratory will be fully documented. What is more, progress in systems PAGE 8 WILLIAM SPAULDING While Project Starlight has em- phasized the analysis of the UFO event as it occurs, Ground Saucer Watch (GSW) has enlisted the aid of computers in the analysis of the photographic 'evidence for UFO events which have already taken place. As most ufologists are keenly aware, UFO photographs have presented serious problems of both interpretation, and authentification. But new progress on both counts was presented by GSW Director William Spaulding. Edge enhancement, the first step in the computerized analysis of photographs, automatically sup- presses bright and dark blotches, while at the same time intensifying image changes from white to black or from a lighter to a darker tone. The result is a high-contrast image which sharply delineates objects photographed. With the second st'ep, color enhancement, the photographic density is elec- tronically analyzed and classified in- to more than thirty colors which contour the thickness and shapes of objects. The last step is actual com- puter enhancement of the photograph. This is accomplished by digitizing the photo into thousan- ds of tiny \"pic-cells\", that are assigned numerical values according to their relative intensity. A graph, displaying the pic-cell information along a visual cursor, can be superimposed on the photograph. In this way data on shape, density, and J. ALLEN HYNEK Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Director of the Center for UFO Studies, told the full story of the infamous Michigan swamp gas case to the MUFON audience. Apparently the case could not have happened at a worse time; for Dr. Hynek that is. With his jaw wired from an accident a few days earlier in New Mexico, Dr. Hynek arrived to face a screeching horde of reporters who demanded to know the explanation for the sightings before he had time to interview the Dexter or Hillsdale witnesses. Yet on the evening before the Detroit press conference, 'a chemistry professor from the University of Michigan approached Dr. Hynek with a possible explanation: swamp gas. After studying the chemistry and visual effects of swamp gas, they concurred that indeed some of the Michigan sightings were probably just swamp gas. Happy to have some alternative to planetary invasion, Dr. Hynek faced the assembled media representatives with the possibility that some of the sightings \"could have been due to the release of variable quantities of marsh gas\". Of-course the press seized on this as the official ex- planation for all UFO sightings. The ensuing notoriety is well known, however the effect on ufology was even more profound. Under pressure from certain members of Congress, including Gerald Ford, the swamp gas episode eventually led to the for- ming of the Condon Committee and a more intentional whitewash of the UFO phenomenon."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"INTERNATIONAL ROUND-UP: PART I by Richard Hall, MUFON Internallonal Coordinator From a survey of and correspondence with cooperating individuals and groups around the world, here are some facts and figures about the MUFON in- ternational network. AFRICA. Representative for Rhodesia is Mrs. Cynthia Hind, a free-lance jour- nalist who travels extensively at her own expense following up on UFO reports. She speaks Afrikaans fluently, and is member of a group in Salisbury called \"S.F. Alpha.\" She submits cut- tings (clippings) and reports regularly to MUFON. Most Rhodesians, she says, consider people interested in UFOs to be \"cranks\" and the press does not take the subject seriously. Carl Van Vlierdan, a homeopath with training as a mechanical engineer, is representative for South Africa. .Carl sent in packets of newspaper stories, along with notes and comments, for the 1975 sighting wave. AUSTRALIA. Research Associate Paul Jackson, in Hobart, is Correspondence Officer for the Tasmanian UFO In- vestigation Centre (TUFOIC) whose reports areread in SKYLOOK from time to time. Their creditable work is sum- marized in a newsletter (copies received by MUFON). Correspondence has also been received from Keith Basterfield (MUFON appointment pen- ding). Research Officer for UFO Re- search in South Australia. Distance in Australia, he says, divides UFO groups but an umbrella organization called Austrialian Co-Ordination Section for the Center for UFO Studies (ACOS) has been formed for cooperation with the Center, and will also correspond with MUFON. Keith chaired a session of ACOS October 4-6, 1975. He and Bill Chalker of New South Wales are com- piling a catalogue of Australian low level and close encounter cases. At present, the catalogue includes about 340 cases and about 30 occupant re- ports. BELGIUM. Miss Alice Ashton, Photo Dossier Supervisor for the Societe Beige d'Etude des Phonomenes Spatiaux (SOBEPS) in Bruxelles, cooperates fully with MUFON and has submitted detailed case reports. There are several UFO groups in Belgium, she says, but the two most important are SOBEPS, whose journal Interspace is received by MUFON, for the French- speaking region; and GESAG, publisher of UFO-INFO, for the Flemish-speaking northern district. Overall MUFON representative for Belgium is Jacques Bonabot, a career military officer and Director of the Dutch department of Groupement pour ('Etude des Sciences d'Avant Garde (GESAG). A third Adamski-oriented \"cultist\" group) he says, operates at Antwerps. Jacques has submitted a list of significant Belgian UFO reports since 1960, and a recent Dutch newspaper report of a sighting by Belgian Air Force meteorologists. ENGLAND. J.B. Delair, Secretary for Contact (UK), is representative. Copies of their publications \"Awareness\" and \"The UFO Register\" are received by MUFON. They have nearly 200 field investigators all over Britain, and a world UFO catalogue in progress with upwards of 45,000 entries (in cooperation with Dr. David Saunders' UFOCAT). Other British organizations include the British UFO Research Association (BUFORA) and the Network of Northern England UFO associations. Delair notes'\"small favorable movements in the science arena, and slowly several British scientists are expressing (openly) an interest in the subject.\" Politically, UFOs don't exist and the national press says little. Popularity interest is high arid steady and sales of all UFO books are • described as \"brisk.\" FINLAND. Ilkka Serra (nee Seppanen), a student in Imatra, is representative. He gathers data from newspapers and UFO-related publications in Scandinavia and forwards them to MUFON, and relays MUFON information to the Finnish people. Ilkka is associated with the UFO Study Center of Finland, whose president is Tapani Kuningas, editor of Ultra, the. major UFO publication, and author of two UFO books. There are several UFO clubs in most of the major cities, he says, but they cooperate with the Center. Ilkka previously submitted a summary of the major sightings and landings in Finland. FRANCE. An appointment is pending for a French representative. An exchange has been arranged with Ouranos (in its 25th year of publication) with Director Pierre Delval, who has kindly granted permission for MUFON to use any information contained in the journal. An exchange of French for U.S. clippings on UFOs has been arranged with Mr. Jean Bastide. in Aix-en- Provence. GERMANY. Illo Brand von Ludwiger, a physicist in Munich, is representative for West: Germany and Director of MUFON-C.E.S. (Central European Section, German-speaking members in Austria, Germany and Switzerland). He submits English summaries of German reports. Due to the activity of cultists groups that have made serious public and TV and newspaper attitudes are very negative. The group includes physicists and mathematicians who specialize in studying physical aspects, possible propulsion methods, and implications for theories of gravitation and unified field theories. An annual meeting is held, with presentation of technical papers. Illo Brand has collected about 700 cases of UFO sightings over Germany. JAPAN. Jun-lchi Takanashi, representative for Japan, is one of the best informed UFO experts in that country, and the invited author of several UFO books. He is an exporter, writer, and Chairman of the Modern Space Flight Association (MSFA). He reports that UFO events have been frequent, and appear often in newspapers, magazines, and on TV. A popular bimonthly UFO magazine entitled \"UFOs & Space\" has been very successful there. There are at least four major UFO organizations.

Should we disbelieve the witnesses who describe these exotic types? Or should we admit that the genre \"UFO\" is more infinitely complex than we had hoped? Southern California is a gathering place for oddnies of all kilds. We have strange religious and metaphysical cults, unusual behavior in manners and dress. We have our \"oddities\" in UFOs, too.. On January 24,1967 a gOsteniig object shaped Eke e top hat startled a fourteen^ear-oU boy at sunset It appeared adjacent to a bedroom window in his home in Yorba LWa, Caifomia, some thirty miles southeast of Los Angeles. It had the texture of \"aluminum fid\", and four thin tegs dangled from the bottom. These legs or \"antennae\" had reduced their number to three by the tone the quick-thinking boy snapped a picture as the visitor meandered away.

As strange as the objects seemed to them, they reported them in good faith. The incidents were subsequently documented and recorded PAGE 10 These \"oddities\" night have been simply stuck away in organizational fles and forgotten, had not a starting coincidence occurred. Within weeks of each of the above sightings, UFOs which seemed almost identical cropped up in the torature under circumstances that precluded any cokborathm on the part of the witnesses. Consider the flying \"toptet\" which startled the young witness in Yorba Linda on January 24, 1967 (sketch A). Within weeks, an almost identical object was sighted on March 22,1967 ii Wapeb, Iowa. This witness was also a fourteen-year-old boy, Douglas Eutster. His sketch of a hat- shaped UFO with four legs or \"antennae\" bears an eerie resemblance (sketch B), but was not made public until the winter of 1967, almost a full year after the Yorba Linda youngster had shakily drawn his sketch for his concerned parents and long before NICAP had begun an intensive investigation of the Yorba Linda photo. * To add to the mystery of this mufti-legged craft, which seemed to have a propensity for dose approaches to children, in Dubuque, Iowa on October 12, 1967, a similar device hovered over a group of youngsters at a Columbus Day picnic. Although the angle of vision did not permit a view of its top, several \"poles\" hung down from the rounded bottom. 5 So we have a strange \"oddity\" recurring within months, and then seen no more. Does anyone out there have any spare photographs of flying top hats? In regard to the flying \"geranium pots\" of May 24,1966 (sketch F), there is more than a passing resemblance between Temple City's UFO and the terrifying object which chased Dale Spaur's patrol car through Portage County, Ohio on April 16,1966. True, the top of the Ohio UFO was not so tall and the bottom part is not in.evidence (sketch G). But consider the foDowiig. The most puzzling thing about the Temple City object was that it seemed to have the ability to change shape. During its numerous appearances over the city, it appeared as a lozenge-shaped affair (sketches 0 and E). However, in one low pass, it revealed itself in the shape sketched (F). Is it possiile that Dale Spaur's nemesis was, in fact similar to the Temple Chy Object? Was it, for the moment, puling in its bottom and revealing only a portion of its top? This question would be academic if only the two cases- Temple Qty and Portage County-were concerned. But there is at least two additional reports which add strength to this On May 27,1966 in a town bordering Temple City, Donald Presti reported an orangwed UFO glowing in the night sky. A casual glance of its Mercury-capsule shape (sketch H) shows that the configuration is midway between that of Date Spaur's UFO and the Temple City \"geranium pots\". This witness reported the object changed shape as it maneuvered away, pulling in its top dome.' Consider, also, the case of the Presque Isle, Maine sighting of July 31, 1966. Douglas Tibberts and Betty Jean Klein, witnesses to this classic sighting, drew two different aspects of what they had seen. The pentagonal shape (sketch C) hovered in the sky, but when the object landed, it somehow projected a bottom (sketch I) not unlike the bottom of the Temple Qty UFO.' The thing which grabs most about the above cases is not necessarily the similarities in shapes and changes in shapes, tt is the fact that aD four cases occurred within four and a hah\" months of each other in 1966. To my acknowledge, no cases involving these peculiar aspects have cropped up since then. Anyone seen any flying geranium pots lately? Next month, this column will point up more cases of identical \"oddities\" occurring within a close span of time, and speculation will be presented in an attempt to explain this End of Part I .REFERENCES .

Barry H. Downing Author of THE BIBLE AND FLYING SAUCERS If you are the kind of SKY- LOOK reader who reads every- ghing von Daniken writes, I hope you at least wait until this book comes out in paper- back. The book is interesting in some ways, but certainly ought not be on anyone's \"ur- gent\" reading list. This is von Daniken's fifth book, al- though his work IN SEARCH OF ANCIENT GODS is really a pic- torial summary of his other works. This is von Daniken's most religious book. His first words in the \"Foreward are, \"This was a book I had to write. It is from the heart.\" Although I am never sure when to believe von Daniken, I do believe these words. In his previous books, von Daniken has marketed him- self as a speculative scientist with a casual interest in re- ligion. In this book his re- ligious self takes center stage, and his scientific self provides -the advertising, or perhaps the props. Von Daniken is either an ag- nostic Catholic, or perhaps a modern day Martin Luther (Luther please forgive me). In CHARIOTS OF THE GODS? it was not clear . that von Daniken was hanging this as the first of ' ninety-five theses on the door of the Roman Catholic Church. MIRACLES OF THE GODS is thesis, number five, and it is hung clearly on the door of the church. Chapter I is entitled \"Vis- ions- -Illusion or Reality?,\" dealing with various Roman Catholic miracle and vision PAGE 12 stories, such as the Fatima sighting of the Virgin Mary, and the \"sun disc\" in Portugal in 1917. Von Daniken believes this \"vision\" really occurred. But'he complains, \"The Catholic Church derives its claim to be the sole authority which can recognize the authenticity of sucl\\ phenomena from its teach- ing mission\" (p. 31). After examining several Cath- olic visions, he even includes a few non-Catholic' ones, such as Joseph Smith's experiences leading to the Mormon tablets. Thus in the first chapter, von Daniken says he believes in re- ligious visions, but he does not believe in the authority of the church to decide when a vision is ...authentic. (He be- lieves in his authority to de- cide, of course.) His second chfoter is enti- tled, \"Who Really Speaks Through the Bible?--Do the Gos- pels Plus the Epistles Plus the Books of the Prophets Plus the Original Texts Add Up to 'God's Word'?\" In this chapter, bor- rowing mainly from Robert Kehl, he attempts to prove that the New Testament is an almost to- tally unreliable document, whose ideas are \"mostly bor- rowed from older religions\" (p. 99). Many scholars are convin- ced that many mystery religions are spin offs from Christian- ity, rather than the other way around, but von Daniken does not deal with these issues. - It is ironic to see that the New Testament is totally unre- liable, since he used the Old Testament to help prove his ancient astronaut theory, say- ing space beings bombed Sodom, and that Ezekiel saw a space ship. Consistency has never been one of von Daniken's strengths. Why does von Daniken go to great lengths (more than fifty pages) to prove you can- not believe the New Testament? Because he wants to answer the. question. Was Jesus an astro- naut? His answer is, \"No, we must forget all about the story of the astronaut Jesus. He did not exist, just as Jesus the Redeemer never existed\" (p. 113). If Jesus was not one of von Daniken's ancient astronauts, who was he? Just a missionary from an ascetic group of Jewish monks, the Essenes. Von Daniken is not just a little opposed to the astronaut-Jesus theory, he is strongly opposed. \"Jesus was...no astronaut. The idea is even more absurd than all the other things that have been claimed in the course of the last two thousand years.\" (p. 114). Yet von Daniken does claim to believe in God. God is kind of like a huge computer which \"exploded\" itself into the wide universe in order to gain \"ex- perience.\" Eventually God will get it all together again, as in. the expanding universe theor7. What about the Holy Spirit, is that how the. visions were inspired? No, there is no Holy Spirit either; instead, there are the ancient astronauts who use mental telepathy to inspire visions in man. They can do"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"this from great distances, and in this way influence the de- velopment of man on earth.. It is not just religious visions that these beings inspire--they also inspire scientific ad- vance, as in.the discovery of the DNA structure. Niels Bohr is among those whose idea of the atom was inspired by the gods. The fact that this idea of inspiration is not far from the biblical idea of the Holy Spirit, the work of the angels, and of God, is not considered by Von Daniken. \" Without benefit of any vis- ions, I predict this will be von Daniken 1 s idast successful book. It has little of scien- tific interest. Its attack on the authority of the Bible and the church will be little no- ticed in this secular age. Von Daniken is not really a student of UFOs, and therefore he knows nothing of the work that has already been done, such as by Jung, and lately Jerome Clark and Loren Coleman in THE UNIDENTIFIED, which ex- plore the possible psychic as- pects of UFOs, visions and dreams. Thus what is new in this latest work--linking gods and visions—is .not really new either.

January 9, 1975; Leek and Cheddleton, Staffordshire, Eng- land., Two separate groups of witnesses about 2 miles apart reported sighting a UFO about 6:45 p.m. One group saw it hovering low over a field, mov- ing past their car, stopping a- gain, then dropping from sight behind a small hill. It ap- peared dome-shaped with two white and one reddish body lights, and flat on the under- .side. The other group saw an object of uncertain shape with two white and one red body light- visible through trees as it paralleled their car at low altitude, almost on the ground, for 10 seconds.

Greg Schier, his wife and a few neighbors claimed that they had seen two bright lights appear in the southwestern sky shortly after 7 p.m. They watched as it appeared to move closer and drift toward the west After several minutes, the Schiers lost sight of the UFO's as they passed behind the bam. It wasn't long before the two lights reappeared over the barn, flew over a tree in the Setter's front yard, almost flew over the house, and disappeared in the east Both thought that there were two fights on one object, but neither could see a shape. The figtowere described as \"being like the headlights of a car as it came toward you.\" Estimates of the altitude ranged from ISO feet to over one thousand. The lights were in sight for almost twenty minutes. reports to be aired that evening. It was also quite early when the first \"UFO investigator\" arrived in Fennimore, in his panel truck with \"UFO\" painted on its side. He began by randomly the Grant County Sheriffs office in Lancaster. A patrol car was dispatched to the area neai Bagley, and the officer reported that he saw the light and that it passed over the patrol car at a low athhude. He made a call over the CB radio about the UFO and since almost all the farmers in the area have CB sets, the word was out About 10:30 p.m., police officers in Fennimore, Wis. received reports of a bright object hi the southwestern sky. It appeared to he at a very high altitude and appeared to be hovering. One of the men tried to take several pictures of the UFO. After watching it for several minutes, the officers returned to town and went to see one of the local citizens. The man, who wishes to remain unidentified, was taken to. the outskirts of the town and he too was able to see the UFO. By 6:30 a.m., radio stations in the area were carrying the reports of the sightings, and news reporters from other areas in Wisconsin, Iowa, and Illinois were calling for more information. Several of them made trips to the area for filmed PAGE 14 More Reports Sometime after 7 a.m., a farmer living near MiUville, Wisconsin, called the sheriff to report that he too, had seen the strange lights-of the night before. In fact, he was sure , thai the light had touched down behind his house, staying there aD night About dawn, the light vanished and it wasn't until later that he was abb to call the sheriff. He has no phone in his farm house. During the day, Nov. S, about a dozen rumors were started. On a farm, not far from the Schiers, a man had found a dead and mutilated cow. The \"UFO Investigator\" seemed to think that this might be related and told newsmen, \"It seems that every time we get an UFO sighting, we get a mutilation.\" . TV. reception had been disturbed on Tuesday night People . reported that their pictures were fuzzy, some stations faded out while others seemed to have unusually strong signals. Once again there was speculation about a connection with the UFO sightings. There was a report of another UFO early on the evening of Nov. 5. At 6:34 p.m., a man called the sheriff to report that he had seen a light near Camel Ridge. There was no object seen, only a bright light that vanished quickly and quietly. Story Distorted The newscasts were another story. They reported that Schier had seen lights and that a-mutilated cow had been found. For some reason, probably because the UFO . investigator had said it several times, the media claimed that the two events were connected. One station also reported the television reception problems and thought that all three were On Thursday, Nov. 6, there were several sightings. About 8 p.m., Greg Schier was hunting with two friends, Dave Huser and Greg Huser. They reported that they saw a bright light in the southern sky that would slowly fade out and then, reappear. The light was at an extremely high altitude, and would hover for a while and then move to a new location. It never moved too far and they were able to keep it in sight until 11 p.m. It didn't disappear, taut the overcast thickened and they went home. As far as they could tell, the object or : rather the light, was still there. At 8:08 p.m., another UFO was reported near Camel Ridge. A little more than an hour later, at 9:19 p.m. the UFO was again reported to the sheriff. At 9:36 p.m., a light was reported near the ground three miles north of Sttaer, Wis. In all the sightings, no one saw an object only a light that some Another string of sightings was reported on Sunday, Nov. 9. The sightings began at 6:10 p.m., when a man called the sheriff to report a bright light in the sky. At 7:14 p.m., there was a second report and at 7:30 p.m., there was a third report By that time, however, the weather closed in and there were high winds, heavy rains and thunderstorms. By midnight the reports had reached various news media and they were calling the sheriff, asking for details. A brief statement was written covering the Schier sighting,- and that was released to the media. It contained no speculation about The Plot Thickens By Wednesday, Nov. 12, the rumors were thicker than the UFO sightings. Calls had been received by the police and sheriff asking about the rumored mutilations of two hunters and if others had been reported missing. One man claimed the UFO's were dropping albino turkeys and that they had knocked down a TV antenna as they passed over a cabin. Others were talking about a wholesale slaughter of cattle around the county. The first thing to be done, the first rumor to be destroyed, was the cattle mutilation rumor. Dr. Jeff Davis, the veterinary in Bloomington, Wis. had examined the cow after it died. He was there less than ten hours after the death and was able to pinpoint the cause as respiratory failure. He went on to say that the cow had been sickly from birth and only had one functioning, lung. Indications were that it had been chased until the lung collapsed, killing the cow. One ear had been \"hacked off with a rather dull knife and part of a lip was missing.\" Dr. Davis was sure that the UFO's had nothing to do with the mutilation. Some siezed on the phrase, \"chased until,\" and wanted to know who had done the chasing. The sheriff, however, thought that he knew the answer to that question and it involved local teenagers, not aliens. In fact, it didn't even fit the pattern of the mutilations that have been reported in other parts of the country. The only"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"damage done to the cow was the missing ear and lip. The blood had not been drained, the sexual organs had not been touched and there were footprints al| over the site. Other mutilations had been reported near Prarie de Chien about four weeks earlier, but even those are open to question. One veterinarian claimed that there were some \"irregularities in the deaths,\" but others felt that disease accounted for the deaths and that .small scavenger animals had eaten the missing organs. There were no UFO sightings in connection with the deaths and no reason to assume such a connection. It was the same with the November mutilation. No connection. Investigations continued for several days and they revealed that Greg Schier had first seen a UFO on Oct 30,1975. He said that it appeared in the south, close to the horizon and slowly moved to the west. Finally it \"descended behind some trees and I lost sight of it It seemed to be huge and was white.\" Schier didn't see any shape, only the light That was the problem with al the Schier sightings. They never reported any objects, only bright lights. The first and second sightings give no clues to a real identity. They could have been nocturnal lights, or, given the weather conditions, scattered ground fog and low hanging clouds, the Schiers could have fooled by Jupiter and Sirius seen through the fog and clouds.  : The final Schier sighting on November 6, is probably Jupiter. The descriptions and weather lead directly to that conclusion. Jupiter is very bright and when seen through scattered clouds would seem to dim and disappear. They never saw it move far, indicating that it didn't move but that they were fooled by the atmosphere and their own eyes. There is no reason to believe that the Schiers saw an extraterresbal spacecraft  • . The officer sent to the area after the November 6 Schier sighting was probably fooled by the similar natural phenomena. His sighting was of only one light and is therefore, not related to the Schier sighting. Once again, there* is no reason to assume anything extraordinary. The officers in Fennimore, Wisconsin, reported that they saw a light but unlike many of the others, they identified it. Larry Smith said that he was sure that he was looking at Jupiter. A star chart and a professor at the University of Wisconsin confirmed Smith's opinion. There is no reason to :er. for making up stories. The radio reports of UFO's may have suggested the idea to him and since there was no other witnesses and no physical evidence there is no reason to deal with the rumors. The important point here is to remember that as far as had been demonstrated by the facts and the investigations, there were no sightings of UFO's, LaVerne Ackinson used a Kodak Instamatic Camera to take several pictures of the light. However, what appeared in the pictures is not what they were looking at There are several ways to explain the arc of light in the pictures, none of which are very satisfactory. By the same token, there is no reason to believe that there is anything extraordinary about the pictures and since none of the people present saw the \"thing\" that was photographed, there is really no place to go with it The MiUville farmer's sighting wasn't reported until the next morning and several people indicated that he had a reputation The light reported at 6:34 p.m., near Camel Ridge is probably Jupiter. Since the planet accounts for a large number of the sightings, it is reasonable to assume that it applies here. The November 6, sightings can all be explained by Jupiter or noctural lights, or a combination of the two. Again, no'one saw any objects and the weather was the same as it had been for the last two nights. There were scattered clouds and patches of ground fog. These factors, plus the renewed interest in UFO's may account for all the sightings. The November 9, sightings have aU been identified. At 6:10 p.m., and again at 7:14, the light causing the sighting was Jupiter. At 7:30, just before the rain and wind storms hit, there was a sighting of the moon. Noonlight through the thin clouds caused a strange glow but sheriff's deputies were sure that the sighting called to them was of the moon. In addition to all the sightings that are explained by Jupiter and the moon, there are others that can be explained by other facts. For example, one man called the sheriff to report that he had seen a flashing red light hovering near the edge of town. Since the UFO was still in sight, a car was dispatched to the area and the UFO was identified. The man was'looking at the flashing red lights put on radio and TV towers so that planes can see them at night The man had been hearing the UFO reports for several days and when he noticed the lights, for the first time in years, he called the sheriff. It was a case of the man living in the area for several years but not looking at it. ' Grant-County sheriffs deputies kept any rumors from- spreading. As reports poured into the office, they would try to identify the UFO. Many times, by keeping the witness on the phone and stepping outside, the deputies could see the UFO. They always seemed to turn out to be Jupiter. Some of the witnesses would then come to the sheriff's office and point to the UFO. They would point out a bright, blue light moving irratically and the deputy would point to Jupiter. They were The deputies weren't interested in just explaining the. sightings. When they had an answer, they would provide it and in these cases they had it However, some of them had seen UFO's on other occasions and one or two told investigators of those sightings. They involved more than just a bright light in the sky. One deputy said that he had seen a large, cigar-shaped craft with lighted windows. It has passed over the car slowly and had made no sound. If anything, it proved that the deputies were being completely candid in their comments. It is almost ridiculous to explain the other rumors that accompanied the UFO's. However, to prevent anyone from suspecting that a total investigation wasn't carried out, I will First, and probably .the most.important of the. related phenomena was the TV reception problem. There wss no reason to assume that h was connected with the UFO's. The 'reported problems were not consistent with the EM effects as demonstrated in the past In UFO related cases, the reception is usually stopped and the power is knocked out . When the UFO leaves the area, the reception and power return. The EM effects are usually restricted to a limited or powerplant, the effects can be spread over a large area . but those are indirect The UFO affects the station and that affects the outlying areas. However, the TV reception problems of November 4 did not fit the pattern. TV reception was also impaired in regions of Iowa and NBC reported that they were having transmission troubles on that date. The problem was in New York and not in Wisconsin. Others, living in Fennimore, Wisconsin, reported that such troubles were quite common and happened at least once a month. The reception difficulties fit the pattern of. the problems in other.months and not in UFO .sightings. There is no reason to assume a connection. That didn't prevent an editorial in the FENNIMORE TIMES. The writer remembered the UFO and the reception and wondered if it wasn't a rather strange coincidence. A strange coincidence, yes, but not related to the UFO. Usiog the logic that there is a connection because it happened on the same day is shakey. There was a report of a bomb on the Fennimore campus, of the Southwest Wisconsin Vocational- Technical Institute and since it happened on the same day that the \"UFO appeared,\" the two events \"must\" be connected. Of course that is not true, but it does show how faulty the logic is. The chance of physical evidence connected to any UFO sighting is a big factor for most investigators and they will go out of their way to find it And, since the downed antenna was found the day after the first UFO sighting, several assumed-a connection. An examination of the area showed that the only damage was done to the antenna and if an UFO had been involved, there should have been indications in the trees surrounding the site. None was found. There were high winds, and it is more Italy that the wind is responsible for the damage. Since no one saw a UFO near the antenna at any time, there is no reason to assume that one was there. Some aren't content with that however. They want to believe that a UFO hit the antenna and will not accept any other answer. One by one, the rumors as well as the UFO sightings were explained until only the albino turkey rumor was left. That was started fay one man who claimed to be a UFO investigator. He believed that UFO's had been dropping albino animals for experimentation and he 'was looking for PAGE 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"confirmation of thk Save there NM no UFD't, meaning spacecraft, there wu no reann to raped that any ditto turkeys would be found. The investigator drin't wsn chase hit own rumor very hard. There had been a rfiort story in the FENNIMORE TIMES about an afcino raccoon being Bed. It happened weeks before the UFO sightings, hut at feat it was atom ABfnoism is common to all species on earth, and again, no reason to assume an (uuiluiulul origin. The final conclusions, after several days of investigation, is that there were no sightings of an extraterrestial phenomena. AD the sightings can be explained, easily, by alternative factors. The key word is easily. Why invent a spaceship when one isn't needed? There are many other cases where alternatives don't exist, but there in Wisconsin there are dozens of alteratives. AD the tat of UFO's probably lead some people to look for strange things hi the sky and when • they start looking, they are bound to see it Unless new information is added, there is no reason not to believe that all the sightings are explainable by natural phenomena. The Series of Wisconsin sightings show the investigator's need to probe beyond the witnesses. Don't just ask what they saw or thought they saw but explore aH the information. What baffles one can be explained by another. By only Inspecting the surface, we could have been left with a physical evidence case, EM effects, one mutilated cow, pictures, and multiple witnesses. Looking further, we found solid explanations for all the facts. We didn't have to reach to make them fit or didn't have to bend them into shape. They were there, hidden by the surface clutter, some of it thrown up by a mailed UFO investigator. The job of the realinvestigator is to find explanations for sighting! He is not there to interview one or two people but to talk with everyone that has a stake in the case. Only by eliminating the worthless sightings wi we he able to move the UFO into a respectable location. Leaving haphazard investigations for debunkers to destroy only ruins the credibility of other sightings and in this business, credrtffity is MUFON 103 OLDTOWNE RD.

Hassel At about 4 o'clock in the afternoon of 28 January 1976 Lacuion Johnson was looking out through a glass door of her second floor office. The door faces southwest and opens onto a por- ch. The sun was low in a clear sky in the west-southwest direction. Miss Johnson was standing about a foot from the glass when she noticed an object moving from the left toward the direction of the sun. The object was elliptical in shape in its upper portion and flat on the bottom. It's elevation angle was no more than 10 degrees, so the underneath side could not be seen. The upper portion was a smooth, shiny surface having the ap- pearance of bright aluminum. The rays of the sun reflected off one por- tion of its surface. It moved noiselessly with no trail, and its outline was well defined. The ob- server at first thought it might be the Goodyear blimp, but then realized it could not be because of its flat bot- tom. After watching it for about 5 seconds during which time it moved in a straight line through a line-of- sight angle of about 45 degrees, and moved slightly past the southwest direction, she turned to call to another in the office. A second or so later, when she turned back to the door, the object was gone. Based upon Miss Johnson's descrip- tion that the object appeared to pass close to a church steeple a block away, it is estimated that its distance was 500 feet and its altitude was 75- 100 feet. Its estimated diameter was 26 feet and its speed 100 feet/second. Miss Johnson reported that she had one previous UFO sighting. This was a nighttime light sighting in Detroit in 1968 in which the light alternately hovered and darted. Miss Johnson uses glasses for driving, but was not wearing them at the time of the sighting. She has interest in UFOs but has not followed the literature. The UFO was seen in Santa Monica, but since the Goodyear blimp did not pass over Santa Monica on January 28, it can be eliminated from consideration. Also the UFO ap- peared too close and at too low an altitude to be a plane. The charac- teristics of the sighting would in- dicate that it could not be a con- ventional object. 1976MUFON SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS \"Swamp Gas Plus Ten - And Counting\" by k J.

At least three occurances of a low-pitched, throbbing sound passing near witnesses who could neither see a source or otherwise account for the phenomenon have been reported. Two of these unidentified sounds were reported by staff members of Project Starlight International who were on both occasions participating in the nightly \"UFO watch\" at the P.S.I, facility hear Austin. The third report came from totally independent witnesses who were \"buzzed\" three times in a wooded area some 50 miles from the P.S.I, site by a similar- sounding UFO. The first occurance, in November of 1975, was recorded by the witnesses as a highly unusual phenomenon but not considered important enough to report as a UFO \"sighting\". The second unidentified sound heard in the same location, followed by a third report only 18 days later from university students near San Marcos Texas, prompted a consideration that this may represent a new type-event of possible importance in the overall UFO picture. We ask any other field investigators who have taken reports of similar unidentified sounds to forward them to. the MUFON headquarters. The first reported \"sound-UFO\" was witnessed by 7 persons in a rural area about 20 miles northwest of Austin. The date was 9 November 1975 and the night sky was clear at 9:45 p.m. The witnesses describe a sound that began suddenly, nearly overhead, and lasted about four seconds moving apparantly northwest. One of the people present, P.S.I. Director Ray Stanford, described the sound as a periodic beating, \"like a mechanical airfoil of some type beating at three to six times per second\" Another witness, Bob Dunnam, said the sound was like a far-distant train chugging. He also said he had a \"strange feeling\" which began about 10 seconds before the sound started, as if someone was doing something to his hearing. AN of the witnesses searched the sky for some object that could be producing such a sound but saw nothing. It was suggested that the rotors of a helicopter at an altitude of several hundred feet could produce such a sound, but no helicopter engine was heard, and the sound was said to have begun and ended very suddenly overhead. A second occurance at the same location, again at night, happened on 27 February 1976 at 11:05 p.m. Max Wilson was walking down a road toward the P.S.I, laboratory building with his dog when he was startled by a sound described 1 as \"like wind through high tension wires but with vibration or pulse\". The sound lasted 8 to 10 seconds and seemed to move from left to right about 15 feet in front of the witness. Mr. Wilson said that the sound was very \"localized\", not more than 7 feet off the ground, and he was surprised that he could not see what was producing it. He said that the dog stopped and looked in the direction of the sound but did not seem frightened. Mr. Wilson said that he is familiar with noises of wind, birds, and animals, and he cannot place the sound he heard that night among any of these natural phenomena. Other members of the P.S.I, staff were present about 50 yards away, but they did not notice' anything out of the ordinary. The latest report was telephoned into the Project Starlight International office the day after it occured by Scott Smith, a university student living in a rural, wooded area between San Marcos and Wimberly Texas. On 15 March 1976, at about 9:30, p.m., Scott Smith, his brother Randy Smith, and a friend, Tami Berg all heard a strange, flying sound \"like a boomerang'.'. The invisible noise passed from south to north and was heard for only four seconds. About 30 seconds later the same, or a similar sound passed above the group. Randy Smith and Tami Berg claimed that it came from the north this time, but Scott Smith thinks that, it came out of the south as before. All agree that it was a pulsating, enveloping sound when directly overhead. Scott Smith was somewhat frightened by the unseen visitor and suggested that the group should return to his mobile home some 200 yards from the small clearing where they were: About 10 minutes later while the three students were sitting outdoors near the mobile home listening to records, the sound came a third time. This pass, heard only by Scott Smith and Tami Berg, went west to east and was slower both.in speed and period. Mr. Smjth guessed that this time it pulsed at about five beats per second, and might have been from a source 10 to 15 feet above his head, altho he could see nothing. (It should be pointed out that there is no way that the altitude of an invisible, unfamiliar sound can be accurately judged. Since all witnesses heard the sound essentially overhead, a greater altitude is suggested. Recall that at one point the witnesses disagreed as to whether the sound was coming from the south or north. -J.R.J.) Randy Smith did not hear this third pass, but it was explained that he was sitting close to stereophonic speakers and thus may not have been abie to hear. The amplitude of the sound was such that it could have been heard by the witnesses, they later described, from inside a quiet automobile with the windows up, but probably not if the engine were running. The witnesses also noted that a collie puppy, playing in the yard at the time, began to whimper and nudge against people's feet in an unusual manner beginning about three minutes before PAGE 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"the passage of the UFO. These three reports remind us that a UFO \"sighting\" need not involve a visual stimulus; that an unknown object, flying at night, may be heard without being seen. It is also possible that these occurances may not be connected with what we usually consider as UFO phenomena, but there is insufficient data available at this time to separate these reports from the conventional UFO material. Perhaps additional experiences with these sounds wiH provide us with a prosaic, natural explanation, or perhaps a report will come in of an observed UFO accompanied by a \"boomerang\" noise. In either case it is important that we collect, document, and publish these odd experiences with fyling sounds, treating them as we would conventional UFO reports.  . ..(CONTINUED FROM PAGE 9) NORWAY. Miss Astrid Svelmoe of the Norsk UFO Center functions as representative for Norway and Anton Lidstrom as correspondent. A packet of UFO reports in Center report forms was received late in 1975. The Center, located in Trondheim, has a cooperating network in Scandinavia and elsewhere. The-Center has a nationwide network of reporters, field investigators, and advisers. Investigators have instructions for surveying, taking samples, sketches, photographs, etc. and have access to two consulting laboratories. Good cooperation, with top military officials is reported. SWEDEN. Bertil Soderquist, an assistant professor of classical mechanics in Linkopjng, is representative. He has submitted a number of detailed case reports and summaries. He reports: \"Slight evidences can be seen in Sweden of official interest, but the subject of UFOs is still very much scorned officially...Hopefully, the technological explanation of the UFO phenomenon which, it has been hinted, the Russians are working on, will prod the Western world into increased activity.\" PAGE 18 Stan Gordon Low Level UFO Sightings in Pennsylvania Reports of UFO activity from throughout the Keystone state have been flowing in constantly to the Pen- nsylvania Center for UFO Research in Creensburg. Many of the sightings have been easily explained as misidentifications of natural objects. Many nocturnal light reports showing indication of intelligent control have been received in recent weeks. Since March several low level observations have been reported. Most of these reports are still under investigation. The following is a brief summary of two recent events. Level Green, Pa. (North Hun- tingdon Twp.) March 28, 1976: At ap- proximately 8 P.M. a woman and her husband as well as their young son ob- served the apparent landing of a UFO between Level Green and Ardara. When the object was first seen it was moving down over a hill and was as large as the front end of an automobile. As it approached closer a red blinking light was noticed on top of the object and a green light on the bottom. The object was of a round shape and was yellow. It appeared to rotate as it moved. Around the middle there appeared to be lights coming from within a rcrw of square Windows. The object approached the trio to within a distance of 4 car lengths. The object made a sound like a chirp in 2 tones. When the occupants of the car stopped to better observe the object it looked like \"a genie's lamp only without the handle and spout\". When the object started to descend behind some trees, something illuminated projected from the bottom. As described by the witnesses \"There were lights on it. Like legs and a wheel. The wheel at the bottom was l|t and the legs were lit up. That hap- pened when it was standing still. It was like lines were coming down and they lit up. It was moving steadily un- til it got to where it was going to land, then it came down then it jerked and bounced\". The object was in view for 15 to 20 minutes before it disap- peared below the tree line. The woman .after the sighting suffered from dizziness and an upset stomach, and the young boy complained of eye irritation. This case from detailed in- vestigation has also produced eviden- ce of a psychic nature which seems to be directly involved in some UFO and creature cases. Mt. Pleasant, Pa. March 28, 1976: At 9:20 P.M. husband and wife were sitting m kitchen talking when they noticed a bright object approaching from the North. They watched it for a short time, when it began to move South. It then reversed direction towards the North then stopped motionless. The object was described as looking like a giant child's top. It was very bright white and there were lights revolving around it. The lights were multi-colored and the smaller lights seemed to vary in intensity. The UFO was observed for almost 90 minutes when it suddenly moved at a fast rate of speed toward the East and went out of sight. The observers live in a house trailer on the outskirts of Mt. Pleasant. There were no EM ef- fects or animal disturbances noted. The couple who were skeptical of UFO reports prior to their sighting were quite amazed at what they saw. The most interesting aspect of the case involves the wife who claims that she heard a voice in her head say in english \"I will show myself to those who believe\". This was heard twice during the time that the object was in view. A further investigation is being made into this case. As I have suggested before, there seems to be in many UFO encounters a psychic relationship which should be carefully investigated. In a future ar- ticle I will discuss this aspect in greater detail."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE by Walt Andrus The May issue of SKYLOOK initiated the first of a series of UFO ac- tivity reports prepared by Raymond E. Fowler, MUFON Director of In- vestigations from monthly reports sub- mitted by State Directors. Each State Director or Acting State Director has received a letter from Ray elaborating upon the method of reporting and a year's supply of forms. A threefold pur- pose will be served by your cooperation in providing these monthly reports to Ray: 1. A chronological catalog of MUFON-investigated reports by date, time and place. This is a basic step towards research. 2. A ready index of special-effects cases received by MUFON for retrieval and research by MUFON Consultants. 3. A medium to assure closely knit cooperation/organization among State Directors, Section Directors, Field In- vestigators and Staff. A steady stream of good investigated UFO reports arrives daily in our mail, therefore, we are cognizant that there is constant activity somewhere on the North American continent. For Mr. Fowler to perform one of the essential facets of his position as Director of In- vestigations, it is essential that our State Directors or Alternates complete this monthly report, whether you have had activity or not. We would like to extend our thanks and commendations to Robert L. Stin- son, Ronald Westrum, and the entire Michigan MUFON Section for hosting the very successful • Seventh Annual MUFON UFO Symposium in Ann Ar- bor, Michigan on June 12 and 13. The facilities were fantastic and the speakers outstanding. Hosting a MUFON Symposium always has a fringe benefit of a lasting nature in a community due to the very favorable public relations achieved and the ex- posure to the news media. The 1976 MUFON UFO Symposium Proceedings was dedicated to John F. Schuessler, former Deputy Director, who is personally responsible for the success which MUFON has achieved since 1969. John, a consultant in Astronautics, has submitted his suggestions to Jim McCampbell on \"Specific Technical Investigations\". We invite and encourage other consultants to respond in similar manner to Jim Me- Campbell's letter that each received two months ago. At the MFON Annual Corporation Meeting on June 13th in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Mr. Thomas H. Nicholl was elected Deputy Director of MUFON by the Board of Directors. Tom is presen- tly the State Director for Kansas and hosted the 4th MUFON UFO Sym- posium in Kansas City in 1973. Tom and his lovely wife, Grace, live at 9936 High Drive, Leawood, Kansas 66206. Mr. Nicholl is the President of a very successful Manufacturing firm in Kan- sas City. He will basically have the responsibility for the business management of MUFON and the JOURNAL, working directly with the other Corporate Officers and Board of Directors.

Dwight's journalism education and newspaper experience were very evident in the professional touch that he personally bestowed upon SKYLOOK. After Dwight and Carolyn build their new home and his additional teaching responsibilities stabilize later this year, Dwight may write a column for the of- ficial publication of MUFON, successor to SKYLOOK. Starting with the June issue, Number W3, D. William Hauck has volunteered to be the interim Editor of the MUFON monthly magazine. Many new names for our official publication were suggested at the Annual Corporate Meeting in Ann Arbor on June 13th. The name which most exemplifies the goals and objectives of the organization as a scientific-educational-research in- stitution is brief but descriptive~THE MUFON UFO JOURNAL. A sub- scription to our monthly magazine will continue to be included in the regular membership dues to MUFON as in the past. The MUFON UFO JOURNAL will now be an integral part of the Mutual UFO Network, Inc., a not-for- profit corporation established under the State Laws of Texas. We all look for- ward to the congenial associations and outstanding contributions of the majority of the present Staff, who will continue to expand the publication which Mrs. Norma Short and Dwight Connelly have so expertly nurtured sin- ce 1967.

RECAPPING AND COMMENTING (Comments in this month's column are based, in part, on articles appearing in the April, 1976, Skylook). By Richard Hall Robert Boyd's request for in- formation and help in studying the physical anomalies suggested in UFO reports tells us something about the state of so-called \"UFOIogy.\" My first reaction was, \"But aren't all those MUFON scientific consultants already doing that?\" After a little thought, I realized more clearly what I had known all along: A few scien- . tists associated with MUFON (APRO, NICAP, and CUFOS) are actively studying UFO cases and contributing something of value to UFO research. Most are casual followers of the literature, too busy with their full- time occupations to be applying scientific methods to UFOs more than superficially. The major cases in this issue —describing, as they do, anomalous effects on cars and physiological/medical aftereffects on witnesses —point to vitally important aspects of the UFO mystery that still are not being studied scientifically, i.e., systematically and employing the instrumentation and expertise of scientific specialists. Can any private UFO group, by itself, bring to bear these instruments and .skills on a regular, systematic basis? No. Medical, physiological, and possible psychological tests are clearly in- dicated for Mona Stafford and Janet Stewart; skilled interviewers, sociologists, social workers, among others, could be usefully employed in these investigations. Physicists, mechanical engineers, electronics ex- perts, and others are needed for in- tensive study of affected vehicles or devices. One can only hope that Mr. Boyd gets a good response, and that others will take similar initiatives to attempt more thorough and systematic studies of physical traces, physiological effects, and all anomalous UFO case aftereffects. This kind of intensive investigation, by establishing the exact nature and relationships of what is happening, could form the basis for later theories. One would hope that CUFOS could take the lead in such scientific investigations and forego premature and ill-founded speculations drawn from psychic and science fiction literature. The \"anec- dotal\" data which scientists decry still dominates the field, and will con- tinue to do so until more thorough case investigations of physical/physiological effect cases are accomplished. I have suggested before the need for scientific/technical committees focusing on special case types, cut- ting across the ranks of UFO groups but drawn from all of them and pooling all information. Neither CUFOS, nor APRO, nor NICAP, nor MUFON by itself has the personnel and resources to do what needs to be done. Collectively, there is a large talent pool, and some access to necessary equipment and in- struments. No Supergroup is needed; just cooperation in the area of hard- core science among the existing groups. [Mark R.
