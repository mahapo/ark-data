My wife was in Santa Bar- bara, diving for lobster. My' son was busy with his newspaper route and my daughter'was playing with 'friecas and neighbors. I decided to take, a mtorcyele ride to Bodega and Bodega Bay, location for the Alfred- Hdtchcock movie \"The Birds.\" The weather was clear 2ndJsunny with some clouds. The' temperature in the low forties and the wind was from the west at 25 to 50 Km per hour with gusts is high as 65: I dressed warmly. I planned my route 2s follows--Hiway 101 south to hiway 237 going ezst. I would then take hi- way 1,7 north to the town of San Raphael to meet 101 going north. I would then travel 101 to 116 going west. This would take me to the two Bodegas. Packed my binoculars in my tank bag. Ny csmera wes out of- film, and I left it behind. At about 11:OO a.m. I left for my destination. From my'home to the junction of Hiway 237 and 17 the treffic was light and I made pood time. -Once I got on 17 however I found the hiway traffic very 'heavy. Many campers, Sundey drivers and tourists filled the two-lane hiway. Because of this,,I 'wc7s touring abmt 100 Kms per hour. As I ,passed through Fremont, I casuelly , looked up and- was-'surmised to see two sail lanes being towed to their altitudes. Bec~use of the wind condition f had not expected any soering for this day. *All four aircrafts were well in front of me, so 1 was able to glance at them occasionally. As I passed the General Motors assembly pl~nt, the hi- way widened to three lanes. The traffic w~s still heavy 2nd the wind fast. I .chose th€ ,center Pzne and' continued .at about 100 Km per hour. Soon .I _nesred the small city- of Hayward. &bout two or three kilome5crs of. the- small Hayward' airport, I glanced at the private aircrefts around the area. Suddenly to my direct left I saw a small twin engine aircrL';; diving sharply; in front of it,.perhaps 100 meters I saw a most un- usual object. The .zircrsft; WAS smalIkr than a C-25. -Probably a six to , eight, {passenger. type,. -'Yliirs :aircraft was perhaps 150 meter,s above the hiway. The object was keeping the ,sane distance from the plane and was also diving. . ., Because of the ,heevy traffik 'and the wind cqndition '1 wes able :tc keep my eyes on this for perhaps only four,s'econds. The object zppe~rzd to be two brillient spheres each about 30-cen$imet~rg 'yide,. separated by the same distance with.a hazy connection in betweeriathat trziled be- ,hind.
