They include the sighting of a tank-like object, the seeming slamming of a pickup into a garage, ground traces, mysterious damage to a gate, unusual reac- tions by farm animals, and the ejection of a tape from a video recorder as a light passed over it. This is a condensed sum- mary of the events. I have investigated this case over a period of months, and have been present at some of the events noted. There have been additional events, which are being investigated, and all observations will be reported in full as compiled and studied. This account contains most of the events, but some \"lights in the sky\" sightings have been left out in the interest of brevity. The exact location of the events is not being re- vealed, at the request of the witnesses. 1 can only say that they took place in Missouri. Likewise, the names of witnesses are not listed, as they have requested. This is not my decision; they simply do not want any publicity of any kind. They are cooperating fully, and will continue to do so until such time as the loca- tion or their names are revealed. The events are listed chronologically, and the first portion is in the words of the witnesses. December 15,1998 My wife and I were driving to our farm to check the cattle. We were on County Road ****, just be- fore the **** home. I viewed a large stationary ob- ject above a high hill behind the *** home. I quickly alerted my wife, causing her to see the object also. 1 drove another 100 yards, just past the **** home, and stopped. When I stopped, the object immediately disap- peared. The object was tank-like in form with at least three orange-colored lights about midway. These lights were running horizontally across the side of the object. It is possible that the other smaller lights were above and below the larger lights. The object produced no sound and then suddenly vanished. Also, no movement was detected as it \"hovered\" above the tree line on the hill. We continued our drive to the gate of the farm, and as we sat in the truck listening to a screech owl, *** yelled, \"There it is again.\" The object was again stationary and hovering without sound or movement in front of and above our cabin. When we began driving toward the object, it again vanished. We then drove to my barn to get feed and again saw the large object hov- ering above the distant northeast timber horizon. The object appeared to be very large, tank-like in shape and with the same orange lights around its mid section. It also appeared to be moving very slowly east- ward until it suddenly vanished. Shortly after the ob- ject disappeared, two large orange lights came into view—to the right of where the object had previously been. These two lights grew larger in dimension and then disappeared with no sound. After seeing this, *** called *** and *** (son and daughter), who then came to the farm also. Nothing was seen for the next 45 minutes. While I was in the cabin I heard them call for me. When 1 ar- rived at the car where they were sitting, they told me what they had seen. While looking eastward, they all saw a glowing light coming up the hill from the creek in the direction of their position. They equated the flow to that of vehicular lights. However, neither the beam or the source of the light was seen-only its glow. In essence the glow appeared as vehicle headlights which had not topped the hill. (Note: no vehicles could get into this area of the farm without passing the cabin.) About 30 minutes later I, along with the other three, saw the same beam or glow moving east across the open field from where they had originally seen the light. It appeared as a faint spotlight searching the field, but the light had no source. Also, there were no vehicles in the vicinity, and no sound was heard. At about 8:45 p.m., while driving home, we ap- proached the *** house (where the first object had hov- ered above the hill). *****, illuminated by his porch light, stood with a rifle in his hand. We stopped, and he told us that his dogs had been barking, so he came out to see what had them excited. His goats, sheep, and large guard dogs who usually spent the night on the high hill had come off that hill and gathered around the house. The animals were very restless. December 16,1998 At 6:45 p.m. 1 arrived at the entrance gate to my farm. I shut off the engine, and as I began to exit the truck to unlock the gate I saw a large bright light appear above the northeast horizon. As I stared, six more lights emerged in a horizontal line to make a total of seven lights. All seven lights were fully radiant for about 5 to 8 seconds. Then, in no certain succession, they began to \"squeeze\" out. I immediately phoned my son, and he"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 October 1999 MUFON UFO Journal came to the farm. After my son and I sat about 20 minutes watching the northeast, we saw a large or- ange light appear. The field beneath the object seemed to have a faint spotlight glow moving around over the field. About 15 seconds later a second orange light ap- peared, and as we were both watching it, a small sil- ver object seemed to exit the orange object and begin moving southeast. We both viewed the silver object as it flew out of sight. The same spotlight effect ap- peared over the field while the light was visible. Over the next 45 minutes, three additional orange lights were seen. December 17,1998 Seven neighbors and 1 (property owner) were at the cabin when we saw a satellite-like light moving from south to northeast at a very fast rate. After the light was viewed for 10 to 15 seconds it made an immediate hairpin \"U-turn,\" or 90 degree angle and began traveling south, the direction from which it had begun. About five seconds after the U-turn a large bright orange 'glow appeared exactly where the light was located. When the orange glow reached its brightest, a very small object moved out of the orange glow and traveled out of sight toward the south. Throughout the next 30 to 40 minutes a total of 16 orange lights were observed; ten lights in a continual succession were seen lighting up in a perfect hori- zontal line across the northeastern sky. These lights were followed a few minutes later by three lights in a spaced apart, somewhat vertical arrangement. *** videotaped some of the ten lights as they lit up across the sky; however, when he attempted to tape the small object the camera would not function. January 26, 1999 (Between Dec. 17, 1998, and Jan. 26, 1999, there were additional observations of numerous globes of light near the ground and on the ground. There was also a possible physical trace event off the cabin prop- erty, but near it. These reports will be released as compiled. See also the separate report regarding the truck apparently shoved into the garage.) At about 7:45 p.m., when leaving the farm for home, 1 had pulled just outside my entrance gate. While closing the gate, my wife and I began watch- ing a large amber-colored object in the northeastern sky. It appeared to be stationary, and had a tail un- derneath it (ice cream cone shaped). We watched the object for about 45 seconds until it disappeared. January 30,1999 Neighbor reported seeing an object very near the ground. He described it as glowing and spinning in a circle just above the ground. He tried to approach it N GATE> GLOW ON GROUND> RING> \"LIGHT PUDDLES\" V\"\" SPRINGHOUSE> CABIN> NEW BARN WINDMILL \"\" e : | OLD BARN '-vT GARAGE IMPACT> Map of primary sighting area. and it disappeared. March 1,1999 At 7:30 p.m. my wife and 1 drove to my barn. As we were stopping 1 saw eight of the very bright amber lights across the northeastern sky. The lights were in a straight line, but on an incline of about 45 degrees with the ho- rizon. Just as 1 yelled at my wife to look at the lights they began to squeeze out, but she did see four of them before they disappeared. A few seconds later we both noted an unusual large bright white light appear high in the eastern sky. As we watched the stationary light, it suddenly at a very tre- mendous speed moved eastward in a very erratic path. The object appeared to do several start-stop maneuvers, as well as up and down and spiral movements at tre- mendous speed. (No blinking lights or other colors were noted on the object.) After the object finally disappeared, over a period of probably ten minutes an almost constant display of large amber lights began appearing in no pattern across the northern and northeastern sky. The lights would appear for 8 to 10 seconds, then squeeze out. On four occasions, as the amber lights reached their full brightness, smaller orange-lighted objects were seen exiting the lights and traveling away from the lights, some in a northern direction and some in an easterly direction."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal October 1999 PageS Witness (face omitted to protect identity) and 7/20/99 physical trace. March 9, 1999 My wife and 1 saw one very bright light in the north- eastern sky at 7:22 p.m. At about 8 p.m. we started to leave the farm, and when we reached the gate, ***** pulled up and told us he had just seen three of the lights. He said while we were driving down the lane from the cabin to the gate, two lights appeared behind us. While we were talking with him, we all saw two bright am- ber lights above and north of the cabin. (The following reports are summarized by me, rather than being in the words of the witnesses.) March 11,1999 The property owner and two neighbors arrived at the farm around 6:20 p.m. At 6:35 p.m. (still daylight) they saw the first of eight lights. They ranged from due east to due north with some in the northeast. At 7:24 p.m. the property owner was able to videotape one of the lights in the northern sky. Three additional neighbors arrived at the farm and observed seven of the lights. On his way home, the cabin owner stopped at **** to leave hay for his goats. **** told him that he had watched two white objects chasing each other at tre- mendous speeds in the southwestern sky that night. He said the objects did very strange and \"impossible\" maneuvers and finally disappeared by going straight up and out of sight. **** (another neighbor) told the cabin owner of another neighbor who lived on the farm just east of the cabin property about 20+ years ago. This neighbor said that his family had seen numerous lights twenty years ago when they lived there. The property owner talked with his previous neighbor and was told that the entire family had indeed seen many very bright white lights very near the ground and at tree top level over the years. On many occasions, they would drive very fast on ATV's (All Terrain Vehicles) or their pick- ups across the fields toward the lights. In all cases, the lights vanished when they would get close to them. He said the lights might appear for many nights in succession then not be seen for several weeks or months but they always continued to re-appear. This went on for several years when they lived on the farm 20+ years ago. They also had seen their fields \"lighting up\" at night but could see no light source. April 1,1999 The property owner, his wife, and caretaker were talking on the back porch of the cabin when the care- taker saw a lighted object coming up from the south- east very low to the ground. All three watched as the small object passed between the witnesses and a wind- mill (75 feet from the cabin). There was a constant monitoring video unit in op- eration at the time. The object which appeared to be three to four feet in size, white with a dark area on it, passed over the video unit, flew by the springhouse and made a sharp left turn which put it in trail of a car driving away from the cabin. It was lost to the wit- nesses as it passed in front of the cabin. They ran to the video unit to find it shut down and the tape ejected. Nothing was on the tape and the re- corder has not worked since the event. This event is"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Paged October 1999 MUFON UFO Journal still under investigation. There was no sound to be heard, even though the object passed within 50 feet of the witnesses and low to the ground. May8,1999 The property owner drove to the northern section of his property to check his cattle and found a double steel gate that contained the cattle in the bottom field lying flat on the ground. The hinges were torn off the gates on both sides; the cattle, however, did not leave the field. The half inch steel pins were bent from vertical to horizontal toward the field with the cattle, and the gates were lying in the field with the herd. There were no impact marks on the gates, and no indication of injury to the cattle could be found. The gates had to have been hit by some great force from outside the enclosed field, and yet no impact marks are visible. This event is still under investigation. May 9,1999 At 8:15 p.m. the property owner and his wife saw a bright white light in the eastern sky. It appeared to \"dribble\" or bounce around a short distance of sky to- ward the north before it squeezed out. At 9:20 p.m. a faint amber light appeared just above the north tree line. The light slowly ascended higher and higher in the air and progressively became brighter and brighter as it also became larger and larger in size. It was vis- ible for 5 minutes. It was also seen by yet another neighbor, ****. Another neighbor called to tell him that he and his wife had seen the light from their home some distance away. May 11,1999 The cabin caretaker reported that he couldn't sleep so he got up to make coffee and walked to the yard of the cabin. As he stood in the yard, his attention was drawn to what appeared to him as two spotlight beams moving around in the open field northwest of the cabin. No source for the spotlights could be seen. They were visible for several minutes, covering a considerable area of the field before they disappeared. May 12,1999 The property owner, his wife, and the caretaker observed a bright light in the northeast at 9:20 p.m. It moved slowly to the south in about two minutes. There were no blinking lights and no sound. As the property owner and his wife were leaving the cabin at 9:45 p.m. they saw a brilliant glow on the ground near the en- trance gate. The glow appeared to be about 50 feet in diameter, and the trees around it were brightly illuminated. As they approached the gate the glow disappeared. No traces were found. There were no vehicles around the gate and none seen moving away from it on the small gravel road. May 18,1999 Seven neighbors at the cabin saw, in daylight, two of the amber lights in the northeast. During the next 15 minutes, a total of 13 of the lights were seen by all. Video was taken. At 8:45 p.m. 20 minutes later, two structured ob- jects of odd configuration were seen by all seven wit- nesses and videotaped as they moved across to the north. Suddenly, one of the objects reversed direction (as seen on the tape) climbed in an easterly direction flying past the upper object at high speed. Careful examination of the video shows the two objects as elon- gated with a possible dome on the top. There was no sound. Later in the evening a very large, stationary light appeared in the east, just south of the windmill. The huge and stationary amber light was motionless for 15 minutes. Video footage was taken, and the light be- gan moving toward the cabin area. As the soundless light came closer, a smaller red light dropped out of the back of the large light and followed behind it. The objects continued westward with no sound, and as the larger lights made a right turn, the smaller ob- ject continued southwestward. The large light contin- ued on an almost complete circle around the area and finally disappeared to the northeast. They learned later that another neighbor had also witnessed the objects from a different location. May 19,1999 Seventeen people, including this investigator and his wife Ginger, observed 35 to 40 of the orange dis- plays over a period of several minutes. The displays were quite large and very bright. We had four video cameras operating, and three failed to record anything but snow. One of the videos did show a half frame of image while the lower half of the frames were garbled. The lights can be seen whenever they move into the upper portion of the frame. This investigator was also shooting high speed 35mm color stills, and the film recorded only very tiny lights, even though I was using a 400mm telephoto and the lights were easily bright and large enough to photograph. On this same evening, another neighbor located 1200 feet down the road reported to us that he and his family had seen numerous orange lights and that his large guard dogs and livestock had \"stampeded\" off the high hill between his location and ours at about the same time. May 20,1999 Seven neighbors gathered at the farm and at 8:45 p.m. they saw four of the large amber lights to the north and a small red light was seen exiting one of the lights. It moved away in an unusual pattern. The property owner tried to videotape the lights but the camera would"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal October 1999 Page 7 Steel gate torn from hinges. not function. After the lights disappeared the camera worked normally. May 24,1999 The property owner contacted Whiteman Air Force Base (Sedalia, MO) and described what he had been seeing without giving the exact location or his name. He talked with two individuals who told him that Whiteman would have been advised of any ma- neuvers of any kind and there had been none. They told him that such lights would not be permitted in the first place and could offer no answer for the lights, except they were not military. At 9:20 p.m. the property owner, his wife, and another neighbor saw one of the bright amber lights in the north. It was at the timberline, then rapidly as- cended upward, became progressively brighter, and after three minutes it squeezed out. June 26,1999 The caretaker and two friends saw six of the large amber lights in the north and east. One light was due east over the old barn. Then three lights were seen northeast in a circular pattern. The other two were single lights in the northeast. July 3,1999 At 9:15 p.m. the property owner videotaped sev- eral amber lights rising above the north timberline and a bright white light was seen overhead moving at ter- rific speed to the north at 10:18 p.m. At 10:30 p.m. another brilliant white light was seen overhead and moving extremely fast to the east. July 5,1999 The property owner observed two small lights moving from north to south at 9:58 p.m. The two were moving side by side; suddenly the one on the left stopped, and the other light traveled on- ward. A second or two later the one on the left began moving again and suddenly stopped again. Due to the stopping of the left one, the one on the right was now considerably ahead of the other. He tried to videotape the objects, but they were too dim to be recorded. July 7, 1999 At 9:16 p.m. one of the large amber lights was seen in the southeast by the property owner. It was visible for about 10 seconds and then squeezed out. At 9:46 p.m. a second amber light was seen in the northeast for about 6 seconds, then squeezed out. These were seen by the property owner, caretaker, and a neighbor. July 13,1999 At 9:07 p.m. the caretaker and property owner for the sixth time since July 7 saw the large light appear for 8-12 seconds in the southeast then squeeze out. The light was pure white in color. At 9:30 p.m. a large white light appeared in the south. The light appeared to be stationary, then began slowly moving north, in our direction. The property owner began videotaping and obtained three minutes of footage. As the light slowly moved north, no sound was heard. It stopped over the old barn and hovered for about 15 seconds, then began moving at a faster speed due east and out of sight. July 14,1999 At 8:58 p.m. the southeast light appeared again for the seventh time, being visible for 8-10 seconds before squeezing out as usual. Between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m., the caretaker and property owner saw numerous white lights appear and move slowly in different di- rections. These were all videotaped. At 9:37 p.m. the caretaker saw a very large object east of the cabin. What appeared to be an enormous object moved very slowly across the sky from east to west. The object was longer than it was high, and it was covered over the entire visible surface with vari- ous dim (not blinking) lights. It made a very low humming sound as it traveled, and when it was west of us, it appeared to split in half, with the right half continuing west and the left half turned southwest. The property owner couldn't find the dim object in the camcorder viewfinder, but did"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PageS October 1999 MUFON UFO Journal manage to obtain about four seconds of video showing four of the brighter lights which outlined the large ob- ject. It was dark and cigar shaped; the witnesses esti- mated it to be 300 feet long. The spacing of the video- taped lights around the outer edges do indicate a very substantial object. July 15,1999 At 8:57 p.m. the property owner and seven neigh- bors saw the southeast light in the same location, vis- ible for 10-15 seconds before squeezing out. This was the eighth appearance. As the property owner was driving home from the farm, at a point about five miles from the farm, he saw one of the large amber lights in the north, it was visible for 15-20 seconds, then squeezed out. Another neigh- bor called to say that he had seen the large and bright amber light at the same time from a different location. July 17,1999 At 2:30 a.m. the caretaker saw two of the large amber lights appear in the east over the old bam. Shortly after their appearance a bright white light moved across the sky from north to south and stopped close to the location of the amber lights. July 20, 1999 At 2:15 p.m. while the property owner and care- taker were driving a cow through a fenced alley be- tween fields to the corral, they walked up to a nine foot swirled and flattened area. The area is circular, the central three feet area is slightly raised or less com- pressed than the outer ring. The circle is located where no animals or vehicles could enter, as it is gated at both ends. The alley is a 13.25 ft wide fenced \"run\" which extends the length of the adjoining fields. The prop- erty owner called me right away and I arrived at the farm that evening to obtain photographs and samples, etc. July 22, 1999 The caretaker and property owner saw one of the large white lights at 9:22 p.m. It was to the south and moved north; 15 seconds of video was obtained. At 9:48 p.m. a second light appeared in the northeast for five seconds, disappeared and then reappeared for two seconds. July 24, 1999 At 9:15 p.m. a large white light was seen, and a video was obtained. July 25,1999 At 2:30 a.m. the caretaker saw a string of the am- ber lights come over from the west. Also amber lights were seen coming from the north. These appeared to be 15-20 lights in a single row. July 29,1999 White lights were seen on two occasions between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m., and were video taped. July 30,1999 Video tape of white lights was taken around 9:45 p.m., including the largest white light seen to date. It was in the northeast for about 12 seconds and moved slowly to the east. It was observed by four witnesses. August 8,1999 The property owner was moving cattle through the alley containing the trace site due to drought con- ditions. The herd stopped at the ring and would not cross it. They bolted and damaged the fences trying to avoid moving forward across the site. After con- siderable efforts they managed to get the cattle to go around the ring on the east side where the ring edge is over two feet from the fence (only 6 inches on the west side). The cattle went forward in nearly single file to avoid the ring. The ring suffered only minor damage. This was observed by five people. August 9,1999 I went to the area again to take the iridium flare schedule to the witnesses. There is no question some of the short duration displays were iridium flares. Nothing was seen this evening. I have learned of ad- ditional witnesses in this area having very close ap- proaches and perhaps additional physical evidence. These are old cases and being looked into at present. I believe if we could go into areas like this and quietly extract the data we would find a number of \"hot spots\" with many unreported events. In the past I've been quite skeptical of \"repeater\" events. I would now consider this very short-sighted on my part. When you have more than 50 reported events and more than 40 witnesses, something is going on. This area is being constantly monitored by elec- tronics and eyeballs, I'm sure more will follow.

They were frightened by the noise of the crack and the glass fall- ing to the floor across the room. As they were trying to figure out what had happened they heard a ter- rific noise at the east side of the house and ran outside (through the front door located on the west side of the house). They ran around the house to find a recently hauled junk truck against the garage door. The owner had that afternoon pulled the truck home, drove his pickup into the garage, leaving the junked truck some 12 feet east of the garage door in the dirt and gravel drive. He left the hauling bar attached to the front of the junked truck. The truck, which had no engine, is a four-wheel drive, the emergency brake was on, and the drive was in low-first. Yet, the vehicle had been pushed forward twelve feet, the four oversized tires digging grooves in the drive indicating the wheels were not turning and the hauling bar was driven through the garage door. UFO's or Iridium Flares? A caution on Nocturnal Lights events By Ted Phillips 1 suppose one of the reasons I've tried to stay away from lights in the night sky is there are too many things whizzing around that could be mistaken for a UFO. This is, of course, much more the case in 1999. There is no need to list the countless things flying around that could, under the right conditions, appear really odd. However, there is a fairly new series of lights in the night sky-Iridium Flares-and they do look pretty weird. Sightings of iridium flares would have started in early May, 1997 with the launch of the first five iri- dium satellites on a Delta 11 rocket. This began a $5- billion project of 66 satellites to orbit the Earth in six orbital planes, with 11 spacecraft in each. An iridium satellite's main axis always points to- ward the center of the Earth. One antenna faces for- ward and downward, the other two antennas point to the sides. The antennas, covered with silver-coated Teflon for thermal control, are nearly perfect mirrors. The flaring is brighter than Venus, beginning with an increase in magnitude until it reaches an intensity (magnitude) at flare center of-8 or brighter. It quickly reaches peak brightness, fading rapidly to disappear. The entire observation being 4 to 10 seconds, depend- ing on your position relative to the satellite's path. For detailed information on the internet check out GSOC Satellite Visibility-Home Page. This site will allow you to find your location (even very small towns) and set up your own access page for predictions in de- tail of the iridium flare passes.

Tilden Field Investigator/State Sections Director MUFON (CT & MA) 1 doubt that anyone within the MUFON organiza- tion, or the ufology community as a whole, would dis- agree when I say that our investigative expertise, public education efforts, and general open pres- ence in our local commu- nities produce anything but positive effects. Wit- nesses, experiencers, and other interested individu- als are afforded the op- portunity to discuss is- sues that they are seeking to understand m a safe and supportive atmo- sphere. In addition, police and other official entities have an organization to whom they can refer people who report events that they cannot, or are unwilling, to investigate. It is for this reason that some of my colleagues and 1 here in Western Massachusetts decided to increase our pres- ence with a local \"chapter\" of MUFON ... a subset of Massachusetts MUFON. One of the goals for our first year in operation was to begin to develop a trained cadre of Field Investiga- tors. The reason for this was simple. Coupled with other organizational goals of personally introducing ourselves to every police department in the four west- em counties of Massachusetts, increasing our visibil- ity to the public through media publicity (free adver- tising), bi-monthly open-to-the-public meetings fea- turing a guest speaker, and public/civic speaking en- gagements, the need for more investigators would be- come self evident. The plan to accomplish our goal of training investi- gators involved conducting a Field Investigator Train- ing Seminar designed to enlighten trainees, and ulti- mately make them better investigators. Using the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual and the UFO Field Investigator's Training Guide, a fine supporting text written by T. David Spencer and published by Austin MUFON, I identified ten major \"areas\" of in- struction. Bruce D. Tilden A comment from the Director MUFON Director Walt Andrus notes that MUFON's stated mission is \"the systematic col- lection and analysis of UFO data, with the ulti- mate goal of learning the origin and nature of the UFO phenomenon.\" As the leading, and world's largest, UFO in- vestigative organization, our mission cannot be fulfilled without trained UFO field investiga- tors. This article is a fantastic example for other state leaders in how to conduct a successful field investigator training course. I then set out to find the best, most experienced in- structor for each particular block of instruction. For instance, I secured Nick Morganelli, the Chief Meterologist at the local NBC affiliate, WWLP chan- nel 22, to teach the block on weather. A combination of Joe Cambria (MA State Direc- tor), Anastasia Wietrzchowska (CT State Director), Jules Vaillancourt, and Joe Nyman, a line-up with more than 70 years of investigative experience between them, was chosen to teach the \"investigations/interviewing the witness\" phase of the course. Mark Cashman agreed to teach the \"scientific method\" and \"measurements\" sections, while the \"air- craft\" portion was taught by an engineer and retired Navy test pilot, Oscar Placco from Rhode Island MUFON. Dr. (Atomic Physics) Jim Stevens (CT MUFON) taught \"Physics,\" and Don Fontaine (a State Police investigative photography instructor and Private Investigator) taught \"photography.\" Jack Megis (an astronomer at the local science mu- seum and planetarium) handled the \"astronomy\" block, and yours truly (an expert in land navigation derived from 21 years of military experience) instructed stu- dents in the use of maps and the compass for direc- tions, grid coordinates, and triangulation. The objective was to employ the instructor that could best teach this valuable information to the Fl Train- ees. Each block of instruction continued from 60 to 75 minutes, with short breaks in between to maintain an alert student group. The seminar was held in a meeting room of a local hotel, and instructors were provided with all the ameni- ties: marker board, VCR and monitor, slide and over- head projector-whatever they required to make their job easier. The seminar began promptly at 0800 on Saturday March 13, continued until 2030 that evening, and was followed with a \"social\" period with snacks and re- freshments where instructors and students could inter-"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal October 1999 Page 11 act informally and unwind from a long day in the class- room. Sunday's schedule was not as aggressive, be- ginning at 0800 and ending at 1400. The seminar was attended by 14 students, two of which had already earned \"Field Investigator\" status (one from Rhode Island and one from Connecticut). Of the remaining students, two were from Rhode Is- land, three from Connecticut, and seven from Massa- chusetts, making this a truly regional endeavor. The cost to each student was $100, which covered the two manuals, a pro-rated portion of the meeting room, all supplies, and snacks/refreshments over the two-day period. The course syllabus, and indeed the introduction on Saturday morning, stressed that this seminar was not designed to be the \"end-all,\" but rather an intro- duction to field investigative techniques by profes- sional instructors that would provide a base for fur- ther student research and studies, and, ultimately, suc- cessful completion of the MUFON Field Investigator's Examination. In fact, the last official duty of this author, as coor- dinator and facilitator of the seminar, was to issue a copy of that examination to each student. The feedback that I received from students and in- structors alike was all positive. All participants en- joyed the professional instruction and the interaction with MUFON members from other states. Too often we become so absorbed in our local or- ganizations that we overlook the bigger picture. Some of us may believe that the only real expertise lies lo- cally. Others may feel threatened by \"outsiders\" and their ideas and methods that may be different than our own. Still others may elect not to share information with anyone not connected with their inner circle. I submit to the reader that these are not only paro- chial attitudes, but also dangerous and counterproduc- tive points of view. All of us are pursuing the same goal-the same answers to the same elusive questions. 1, for one, having spent several years working with Connecticut MUFON, and now heavily involved with both \"eastern\" and \"western\" Massachusetts MUFON, will continue my efforts to effect a viable liaison be- tween all MUFON organizations that I interact with. Perhaps this \"regional\" and \"seminar\" approach will be attractive to other MUFON organizations. Besides the obvious positive interactions and exchange of ideas with other groups, the economies of scale inherent in such an endeavor make this concept an especially at- tractive one. As anyone who has been involved in this \"game\" knows (and no matter how hard we try), you can't do it all by yourself. I welcome comments and criticism regarding the content or concepts I have expressed in this article. Burleson offers another look at Lubbock Lights By Donald R. Burleson, Ph.D. Attached is a further enhancement of one of the Lub- bock Lights, done since the one I submitted for the August 1999 issue. The suggestion of cellular, \"bee- hive,\" or \"honeycomb\" structure on the belly of this object is particularly strong here. Richard Hall, in the September 1999 issue, has raised a few questions regarding these enhancements. Let me see if I can answer them. First, concerning my qualifications. I am the direc- tor of one of the computer labs at Eastern New Mexico University (Roswell campus) and a computer network administrator, as well as a research consultant for MUFON and the Investigator for the International UFO Museum and Research Center. In my position at the lab, 1 install, administer, use, and troubleshoot a vast array of software, including image enhancement programs. Drawing upon a back- ground in cryptanalysis as well as computer skills, I have done extensive work on deciphering the Ramey Letter. Mr. Hall asks whether my methods are \"valid,\" and I can only say that while any computer enhancement of an image can be a little \"iffy,\" one has to use com- mon sense as to which sorts of techniques are appro- priate and which are not. When I work on the Ramey letter, for example, 1 use a variety of approaches- stretching, texturizing, embossing, watercoloring, fil- tering, etc.-that I wouldn't dream of using on a UFO image, as these things change the fundamental quali- ties (shape, texture); of the physical object. In enhancing the Lubbock Lights images, I have only used zooming and brightness/contrast (including gamma) adjustment to bring out detail. I have not texturized, embossed, or otherwise altered the funda- mental character of the images. And I have found sug- gestions of the same sort of \"cellular\" structure on all the Lubbock objects I have scrutinized. I say sugges- tions because with image processing there is always an element of uncertainty. The indications of struc- ture, however, are rather striking. As for Mr. Hall's question as to what witnesses have described a \"beehive\" kind of arrangement on the re- covered Roswell craft, it is well known (or I thought it was) that Frank Kaufmann's description of the Roswell object included a honeycomb-type belly structure, and that this description inspired the William McDonald drawings that have been reproduced in Robert J. Shirkey's book 1 Was There (Movin' On Publishing,"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Page 12 October 1999 MUFON UFO Journal The UFO PRESS Inc. Roswell, 1999) and elsewhere. While it may indeed be \"premature\" to speculate that the apparent cellular structure showing up in my Lubbock Lights enhancements could mean that these objects are fundamentally the same kind of craft as that which crashed near Roswell, I have to ask how long indeed should we wait before speculating con- structively and reasonably about these things, when the facts have already been withheld from the public for half a century? 1 believe that only by trying to forge connections, discern patterns, and formulate hypotheses to account for them, will we ever have any chance of arriving at those facts that have been hidden from us. And as Mr. Hall correctly observes, let us hear from a variety of photoanalysts on this question of examin- ing old UFO photos (the Lubbock Lights, the Newhouse film, the Mariana film, and others) by mod- ern computer methods. We all want the same thing, in the field of UFO studies: to establish the truth. Warren M. Holdenbach, Ph.D. New State Director for Mississippi (Courtesy of The Sun Herald, Gulfport, Mississippi) UFOs Over Topanga Canyon by Preston Dennett, St. Paul, MM: 1999, 5X8 paperback, 300 pages, $12.95. (1-800-843-6666 to order) Reviewed by Dwight Connelly The basic thrust of this book, as the title suggests, is to document the many sightings in Topanga Canyon, a mostly rural community of about 8,000 people in the Santa Monica Mountains west of Los Angeles. Dennett, who first began informally investigating UFO reports back in 1986, opens his account with a wave of sightings which began in June of 1992 and ended in 1994. In all, there were at least 82 encoun- ters, 50 of which involved more than one witness. The types of cases ranged from lights in the sky to missing time to reported abductions. Although Dennet is a field investigator forMUFON, the book is more a series of narratives than actual in- vestigative reports, perhaps because such a large num- ber of cases could not be covered in great detail, or because this makes the material more readable. However, some of the cases personally investigated by Dennett are full of details and quotes by witnesses, and this adds both substance and interest. 1 found one case that moved me to contact him for additional de- tails, which he was kind enough to provide. While there are not many new insights presented, this is a very welcome account of this California \"hot spot\" (see article by Dennett in this issue of the Jour- nal). As with books on other hot spots, the account adds to the mass of evidence from throughout the world that something is indeed occurring. 1 found the book interesting to read, and it certainly deserves a place in your UFO library. Conspiracies, Lies, and Hidden Agendas by Mick Farren. Los Angeles: Renaissance Books, 1999.6X9 paperback, 239 pages, $15.95. Reviewed by Dwight Connelly While not without interest, this book seems not to know where it is going. Topics range from \"Area 51\" to \"The Clinton Death List.\" As the title suggests, there is much about conspiracies, including the well-known JFK as- sassination cover-up and the practically unknown \"Hello Kitty\" shirts worn by Japanese females. Many other related and unrelated topics are covered. The author appears to be quite literate and intelligent, and he does provide some topics to pursue further, but there seems to be as much rumor as fact in this book- and it is difficult to separate the two."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal October 1999 Page 13 Preston Dennett Anatomy of a UFO Wave: A Comparative Analysis By Preston Dennett Excerpted from the book UFOs Over Topanga Canyon (see review in this issue) On June 14, 1992, the Malibu/Lost Hills Sheriffs Station in southern California received a series of calls reporting UFO activity over the small rural commu- nity of Topanga Canyon. More calls came into the office of the local Topanga Canyon newspaper, the Messenger. The events of that night were of such magnitude that they were reported not only in the Topanga Mes- senger, but in the LA Daily News and the LA Times. And finally, Timothy Good's book, Alien Up- date, listed the encounter as one of the most significant UFO events of that year. Because I had written an earlier UFO article for the Topanga Messenger and because I am a MUFON field investigator, the editor referred the cases to me. I then networked with the Malibu/Lost Hills Police, who also referred me to sev- eral cases. Being a resident of Topanga Canyon, I was also able to locate many other witnesses to the events. Before long, I had uncovered hundreds of encoun- ters of all types from anomalous lights to metallic ships chasing cars and levitating them off the road. Topanga Canyon, it seemed, was in the middle of a typical UFO wave. When 1 realized that Topanga Canyon might be a UFO hotspot similar to Gulf Breeze, FL, or the Hudson Valley area in New York State, 1 decided to do a com- parative study of these and other well-known UFO hotspots. To my surprise, I found that almost no re- search has been done on UFO waves. Terms like \"UFO waves\" \"UFO hotspots\" and \"UFO flaps\" are often used interchangeably in the literature. In this article, I define a UFO hotspot as a geographi- cally defined area with a disproportional large number of UFO encounters. This can be differentiated from a UFO wave in that a wave is a disproportional large number of UFO encounters over a certain time period. This would be synonymous with a UFO flap. There- fore, UFO waves occur over UFO hotspots. There are several well-known UFO hotspots across the United States. For this study 1 included the fol- lowing six locations: GULF BREEZE, FL; HUDSON VALLEY, NY; WYTHEVILLE, VA; EXETER, NH; SAN LUIS VALLEY, CO; and TOPANGA CANYON, CA. Although these locations are by no means the only UFO hotspots in the United States, they are the most well-known. Using these six locations (which cover all corners of the United States) I conducted a com- parative analysis with an emphasis on finding the com- mon denominators among these six areas. Among the six UFO waves studied, I discovered that there were ten qualifications that defined a UFO wave or hotspot. Each of the above areas exhibits at least eight of the following ten factors: 1. A Full Range of UFO Encounters. A UFO hotspot generates eyewitness reports of virtually all types of UFO encounters including sightings of anoma- lous lights, metallic ships, face-to-face contact, land- ing trace cases, missing-time abductions, animal evi- dence ... etc. Simply, the entire gamut of the UFO phenomenon is represented. 2. An Extremely Large Number of Encounters. Depending on the size and the population of the area, and the length of the UFO activity, there should be anywhere from a hundred to a thousand or more inde- pendent UFO reports. 3. A History of UFO Encounters. In UFO hotspots, it is easy to find historical accounts of UFO activity dating back years, decades, or even more. 4. Predictable Encounters. In these areas, UFO encounters happen with such regularity, that they can be predicted. This consistency often brings in floods of people hoping to see a UFO. 5. Independent Witnesses to the Same UFO Event. Generally speaking, UFOs are evasive and do not want to be seen. In hotspots the opposite seems to be true. UFOs seem to have little or no fear of being seen, and actually put on brazen displays that seem to be designed to attract attention. Consequently, a single object is often seen by large numbers of indepdent witnesses in different locations. 6. Involvement of Official Agencies. In every UFO flap area, without exception, official agencies such as the police, Navy, Coast Guard, fire department, and others become embroiled in the controversy as they try to deal with the flood of UFO reports. In some cases, United States federal agencies (or some faction thereof) also become involved. 7. Encounters Recorded in Local Newspapers. In UFO hotspots, the encounters reach a threshold where they are so numerous, they simply cannot be ignored."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Page 14 October 1999 MUFON UFO Journal Sooner or later, the controversy surfaces in local news- papers. 8. Books Written About Encounters. Because of the intense public interest in this subject, areas with high levels of UFO activity attract a lot of media at- tention, which eventually find their way into UFO books, either as single case studies, or as a book fo- cused solely on the area in question. 9. Sightings by Investigators. A UFO hotspot has such a high level of activity that, sooner or later, those who investigate the area have their own encounters. 10. Photographs Taken of UFOs. Again, UFO hotspots have such a high level of activity that, sooner or later, witnesses are able to photograph the objects. In several cases, videotape is taken. The above ten qualifications, again, are not present in every hotspot. However, the greater the number of qualifications present, the higher the probability that the area is a UFO hotspot. Some of these qualifications were of little surprise. Certainly, one would expect a large number of encoun- ters in a UFO hotspot. However, other patterns were somewhat surprising. The fact that governmental agen- cies invariably become involved was very interesting. I was also impressed that the investigators of these ar- eas soon became witnesses themselves (especially when it happened to me!) The fact that these areas have a long history of sightings seems significant. Perhaps the most puzzling feature that was consistent in every UFO hotspot was the brazen activity of the UFOs, who were obviously putting on a vigorous publicity campaign and wanted to be seen. This, again, doesn't fit with the evasive nature of most UFOs. Could this be the secret purpose behind these freak waves of UFO activity? A publicity campaign? If that is the purpose, one could argue that it has been very effective. All of these areas have received consider- able media attention. This brings us to another important point. Some UFO investigators have speculated that UFO waves and hotspots may be a social phenomenon, meaning that a single publicized UFO encounter prompts other witnesses to report their sightings until the reports snowball into a wave of sightings. Under this model, any area could be a potential UFO hotspot given the right publicity. Arguing against this model, however, is the fact that the number of well-known UFO hotspots in the United States can be counted on one hand. If this phenomenon is caused by social factors, then why aren't there more well-known UFO hotspots? Furthermore, the above comparative analysis shows that UFO waves do in fact exhibit obvious patterns. Therefore it should be easy to identify other hotspots. The main question remains: exactly why are - these areas hotspots? A comparison among them reveals some surprising patterns. Interestingly both Hudson Valley, NY, and Topanga Canyon, CA, are very rural areas that are immediately adjacent to very large ur- ban centers. Could it be that the UFOs are using these rural inaccessible areas like a \"hunter's blind\" is used to observe, study, or hunt wild animals? Another interesting pattern is that both Gulf Breeze, FL, and the San Luis Valley, CO, are the location of considerable military activity and other highly tech- nological installations. Many investigators have re- marked upon the high levels of UFO activity around such areas, speculating that the UFOs are simply keep- ing tabs on our technology. But then, what about Wytheville, VA, and Exeter, NH? They both seem to be typical small towns with little that is unique to make them stand out from the thousands of other small towns across the United States that have little or no UFO activity. Exactly why some areas are hotspots remains a matter of speculation. However, because of the active nature of these hotspots, they represent ideal locations for real-time field research with UFOs. Hopefully fur- ther research into these enigmatic areas will answer some of the many questions about this baffling phe- nomenon. Sources Dennett, Preston. UFOs Over Topanga Canyon.

Miller \"I have had some experiences that I want to find out more about,\" said a caller on July 5, 1994. The woman was married, 46, and had worked as a nurse in Chi- cago for 20 years. She revised to say more on the phone, except that her experiences \"really need ex- plaining.\" She had reached me by referral through the Intruders Foundation. Her apartment complex abutted Loyola Beach on the city's North Side, minutes from the investigator. On Friday, July 15, 1 visited to conduct a routine in- spection and to dispense questionnaires. An air of uneasiness surrounded Vicki Hoyle (a pseudonym; name on file with MUFON). She asked her husband, Rex, and a friend to provide emotional support. The friend held her hand as Vicki began by wondering \"why this had to happen to me.\" She dis- played two marks which I examined. During the three-hour interview, trust slowly grew, and the witness came to life. She detailed the con- tacts, her expression shifting to wonder, fear, and an- ger. Her husband and friend explained that the inju- ries were accompanied by extreme mental distress. This worsened when Vicki could find no solution, in spite of her medical training. She had picked up a book on abductions; contacting the author, she received a referral. She sought more answers, but was fearful of what she might find. Episode One VH: The first thing that happened was on Jan. 10,1 woke up in the morning and my face was as red as a lobster. 1 had no idea what it was, because, you know, it was January. When I went to bed the night before, I was a white person! Also, I had a painful ear, and be- hind my ear 1 had a spot. You can even feel it. It feels like something is in there. PM: Uh-huh. (1 feel a hard lump at left ear about the size of an aspirin.) You didn't have anything there before? VH: No, and it was like a wound, open and seeping. I noticed when I showered the following evening that I had something on my leg. (Vicki turned up her right leg to reveal a nickel-sized mark with a deep, dime- shaped depression.) I had a gouge out of my leg. PM: How did it look at the time? VH: Like a hole. I had no idea where I went, what these things were, what it meant. If I had a rash from wheat I ate...it wouldn't just be on my face. It was really red and crispy. And it developed into sores that About the Author Paul R.

It took until the middle of March to heal. PM: Was it a scrape in one place and a burn in an- other, or was it even? VH: Not even. Where my face curves (she indi- cated the sides of her cheeks) it was not burned, and under my chin was not burned. This part of my ear (outer edge) was burned, but the back part was not, like something hit me front on. I just can't explain it. I tried putting creams on it, and then developed sores at the bottom of my eyes and on my forehead. PM: Now what was the etiology of that? Did it hap- pen the next day, or later? VH: It happened when it began to peel, like leprosy....Also, when the burns appeared, I had vagi- nal irritation. One time, years ago, 1 had a yeast infec- tion, and it felt like that. I have a girlfriend who runs a research study out of St. Luke's Presbyterian Hospi- tal, and I had seen it advertised in the Reader, so I went down there. And my face by this time, 1 can't tell you—it looked like I was abraded by a Brillo Pad. Skin was hanging off. PM: Was internal irritation observed? VH: She said it was... PM: She examined it? VH: Yes. And she said, \"Your cervix is extremely irritated, and the vaginal wall is extremely irritated, like you had lots and lots of sex. But there's no abnor- mal flora.\" At the time, my husband and I were work- ing diametrically opposed...! said, \"We haven't had intercourse in three weeks. So how can I have this?\" PM: Other than the nature of the irritation, she found no sign of intercourse? VH: She said it \"looked like\" I had had lots of sex, but she didn't find anything. I mean, she didn't take a sperm sample, because I would have known, you know? And there was no discharge, only pain. And I had never, to my knowledge, had anything like this happen to me. PM: Was there anything mysterious about the in- fection years before? VH: Oh no. I had taken some antibiotics. It was a real infection, and it worked out normally. One week later, I collected MUFON Forms 1 (Fig-"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Page 16 October 1999 MUFON UFO Journal ure 1A) and 5 (Figure 5). Effects Psychological Effects included: fear and panic, thinking impaired, trance-like state, dreams, memory lapse, and felt observed. Physiological Effects included: hair fell out, ears hurt, nose bled, became paralyzed, felt burning sensation, skin turned red, experienced body marks, wounds, skin peeled off, and vaginal pain/ bleeding. Some mornings Mrs. Hoyle awoke jumpy and mis- erable, with a sudden flu. This followed strange dreams. Her menses were uneven, and her world had become unpredictable. \"I have to tell you,\" she said. \"I've been a very cou- rageous person. I have lots of guts. 1 worked as a nurse for 20 years. I worked nights. 1 was never afraid for a minute....and I was afraid to open my bedroom door.. .when I came back from the doctor. 1 was like this (hands trembling). Was I going insane, or what? There was some bleeding. That didn't happen before, but it happened this time, and I was nowhere in my cycle. Actually...this was in the middle of my cycle, and I've never had any bleeding then. I was very up- set, like losing it.\" Silently 1 wondered if her symptoms spelled PAS- the Post-Abduction Syndrome. Investigators have found that on mornings after encounters abductees wake up with flu-like symptoms, also jumpiness. In- ternal damage frequently appears. It's not a clinical diagnosis, a psychological trait, or a disease. PAS is the consequence of an event-presumably contact with ET's. Thus flu and infections could result from contarrii- nation, while vaginal bleeding might follow participa- tion in a breeding program. Vicki was puzzled at the timing, yet ovulation occurs at mid-cycle. What better time for ova stealers to strike? I shared no such impressions with the subject, who sought only relief. Relaxation techniques were used to dissipate fear as we worked through her defensive feelings. She held the usual concerns about coming forward with an abduction or UFO report. \"I'm a mem- ber of a couple of grassroots political organizations here,\" she explained. \"I'm part of my religious com- munity, and I'm privileged to be a leader in the com- munity. [Talk of UFOs] could affect my validity.\" As 1 lived in the same neighborhood, she feared dis- closure. When this matter was set aside, a confident personality emerged. Mrs. Hoyle rose and led me through her apartment, indicating where the events had happened, and spontaneously acting them out. Episode Two The next encounter was on \"the night of January 17 th . 1 wrote it down because it was so real.\" Between her verbal and written responses, the scene can be re- constructed: The Hoyles had gone to bed, but Vicki lay awake, wrestling an urge to read. Boredom came instead of sleep. She moved to another room so that she wouldn't disturb Rex, or vice versa (he was an operatic snorer), and cracked a book. Still she felt restless. \"Because I had not had dinner, 1 figured I'd make myself a sand- wich.. .\" One her way to the kitchen she saw that Rex was sleeping soundly, the still shadows broken only by the glow of the alarm clock, which read 11:50. Whipping a snack together, she sat at the kitchen table facing the north wall, whose window looks out toward Lake Michigan. A glass of orange juice washed down the sandwich, and all was quiet. Oddly quiet. As she wrote in her questionnaire: \"Noted husband not snoring, so I went back to rear bedroom. Clock read 4 a.m.! Became frightened. Went to bathroom, noticed extreme soreness in vagi- nal area, some bleeding. Felt like a severe yeast infec- tion. Woke up January 18 lh very uncomfortable, with severe vaginal soreness and pain in pelvis.\" Had four hours passed unnoticed? Subtracting her stint with the book and snack, the gap reduces to 3-5 hours, a still troubling number. What had occurred? A possible clue surfaced the day she was examined at St. Luke's Presbyterian Hospital. After the clinician found internal damage, Vicki reports that she: \"Came home very frightened. Sitting in back bed- room with husband that night, I remembered a dream I'd had....A man with pure white skin and hair and shark eyes picked me up in a car and took me far away. I was riding in a bucket seat, with straps all over me so I couldn't move. Next I was in a big, brightly lit room, still in the bucket seat. I was naked except for a bright red miniskirt. I could see it on my thighs. \"There were people behind me, working like scientists...! started yelling 'Hey! 1 want to go home! I have to go home! Where's the guy who brought me here?' Then the man with the white face walked up to me and in the bright light I saw that his face wasn't human. 1 could see through the skin! Next, I was float- ing through a long corridor filled with lights, still in that bucket seat. Then 1 woke up.\" Hypnotic Regression Did the \"shark eyes\" dream relate to Mrs. Hoyle's missing time? I reviewed a tape of the session, which begins with two therapists performing a dual induc- tion. Their voices alternate as they usher her into an imaginary sphere of safety, her mind reaching back to the night of Jan. 17. Once more she is seated at the kitchen table facing the north wall, whose window looks out toward Lake Michigan. She munches the snack. Silence falls. And the wall turns into a door-a"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal October 1999 Page 17 glowing, gold-crested opening on a long blue corri- dor. Guide lights mark the path. Before Vicki can react, her body rises off the chair, passing through the table like smoke through a screen. \"It's not happening. It can't be happening\" her mind shouts as she floats down the corridor. The path ap- pears to run on indefinitely, lights blurring into lines. On and on she goes, until the lines meet, as in the apex of a pyramid. \"It's almost like I'm at the bottom of a pit, looking up at the point,\" she says. \"I'm lying down.. .Everything is blank. [Long pause.] There's just a bright light shining in my face.\" Others are present. \"They have [the light] spanning across the eyes.. .right across the eyes. I feel like I'm immobile.\" Footsteps in the background, soft and scuf- fling, make her think of a work crew. Meanwhile she gauges her surroundings. \"Inside, the room itself is [shapeless]. It looks like I'm in this chair.. .a car with bucket seats. I'm kind of sitting up, like a recliner. And I have a strap across my waist, and a strap over my shoulders, and then a strap crossing through my i \" legs. These words connect the missing time to the memory that surfaced on the 24 lh , as she herself affirms: \"I'm remembering more of my dream.\" A counselor asks, \"Do you have any emotional reaction to this?\" \"No,\" she says easily. \"I can feel the shape of the room, like I'm in a hollow pyramid.\" The room is cavernous, and she can make out little except a door. A lonely place until a creature bobs into range. She yelps at the sight of him; his face is a mesh of bone and skin. The crew converges on her. They poke, jab, snip. Her terror is audible, approaching hysteria. \"Do you want to stop?\" asks one of the therapists Vicki responds with half- formed words and sobs. \"You're here now and you're safe.\" A sigh. \"Do you want to go on?\" Vicki indicates that more is happening to her. \"They are doing something to you sexually?\" She replies, \"They are cutting me with things.\" Her terror spikes when they ask her about her clothing. \"I'm wearing a red robe or something. I feel it over my thighs.\" She is asked to look at the material. She responds, \"Hmm. It feels hot, warm, hot.\" She shudders, takes a gulp of air, shudders again. \"Ooh! It's blood! I'm covered with blood. Oh, oh no.\" The crew finishes, and Vicki reports in a dull tone that \"I'm kind of riding down a corridor.\" Next month the conclusion: a UFO remembered."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Page 18 October 1999 MUFON UFO Journal Ufology profile Downing, the Bible, & UFO's By Dwight Connelly Dr. Barry Downing, author of The Bible and Flying Saucers, has been a MUFON and Fund for UFO Re- search consultant in theology for many years, a speaker at MUFON symposiums, and the author of numerous articles on religion and UFOs. His full-time job is pastor of the Northminster Presbyterian Church in Endwell, NY, where he has served for 32 years. I had not talked with Barry since my days as editor- publisher of Skylook, the forerunner of the MUFON UFO Journal, so the opportunity to again meet with him and his wife Kathleen this summer was a special treat for Carolyn and me. Visiting Barry on his home turf, including a tour of his church and lunch at a local restaurant, provided a nice background for a profile piece. One of the things people often ask about Downing is how he manages to remain pastor of a mainline church while being involved so publicly with UFOs and religion, and whether his involvement in ufology affects his work as a minister. Downing became assistant pastor at Northminster in 1967, and the first edition of The Bible and Flying Saucers was printed the following spring, providing an interesting situation for the young minister. \"My senior pastor was very supportive,\" says Downing, \"although a lot of eyebrows were raised. J understand that one family left the church because they were em- barrassed by it, just as current members sometimes take a bit of kidding from those outside our church. Of course 1 rarely say anything about UFOs from the pul- pit.\" Three yeafs later the young assistant pastor moved up to become senior pastor, and he says his involve- ment with UFOs did not present any problems. The Presbyterian Church is somewhat more liberal than some of the so-called fundamentalist churches, and its formal structure provides some protection from arbi- trary decisions regarding pastors. \"Once ordained,\" explains Downing, \"it is hard to get you out. There would have to be a heresy trial. But 1 might have had trouble in getting ordained if my book had been out at that time.\" He notes that his local church could vote him out, but it would have to be upheld by the Presbytery: Moving to a different church, however, could present problems, since prospective ministers must go through a hearing. Perhaps one reason Downing has had few \"UFO problems\" is his apparent success and popularity as a minister. He takes justifiable pride in snowing visi- tors the several specially-equipped rooms devoted to Dr. Barry Downing at his church in Endwell, NY. ministering to children. There is also a very active program for senior citizens. The church seems to be on the move, and Downing shows the enthusiasm that one might expect from a new, young pastor, rather than one who has been at the same church for more than three decades. He is quick to acknowledge the role that his associate pastors have played in making the church vital. Those who discuss ufology with Downing quickly find that he wrote his somewhat controversial book to defend religion, not to question it. \"In the late 1960s,\" he explains, \"the liberal, better-educated theologians were playing down the miracles of the Bible, calling them myths, and saying that we all know that they were scientifically impossible. This was all part of the 'God is dead' movement that seemed to be gaining momen- tum.\" The Bible and Flying Saucers was written to"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal October 1999 Page 19 show that such things as the parting of the Red Sea and the Ascension of Christ in a cloud could have been accomplished by superior beings from another world. The book, in fact, grew out of Downing's doctoral dis- sertation at the University of Edinburgh, New College, Scotland, in 1966, entitled \"Eschatological Implica- tions of the Understanding of Time and Space in the Thought of Issac Newton.\" Or, in laymen's terms, what does science tell us about the existence of Heaven. \"My doctoral studies were focusing on the relation- ship between science and religion,\" he notes, \"so it was a natural thing to combine what appears to be the advanced science of flying saucers with the miracles of the Old and New Testaments, especially in view of the increasing mo\\ emeni icward L God is dead' think- ing and the proliferating skepticism of leading theolo- gians of the time.' 1 In his book, Downing looks at the Biblical descrip- tions of such events as the Exodus, and analyses their possible relationship to similar modern accounts of UFOs. He says that God functions in three different ways: (1) as spirit or Holy cnergy-i.e. prayer works, even though we may not know how it works; (2) as Jesus incarnate—deity in human form; and (3) neither spirit nor human-thc God that met Moses. He believes that in all three situations, it is possible for UFOs and their occupants to be involved. Downing notes that Jesus said He was not of this world, but of another world and that the scriptures record that Jesus returned 10 thai world, being lifted skyward on a cloud. Dow mnu believes it is quite pos- sible that people of that UJ muuare of scientific mar- vels, could see a UFO and refer to it as a type of cloud. He also feels that it is quite possible that the Jews arc indeed the chosen people of God, \"perhaps with a ge- netic role.\" Downing acknowledges that there is a danger in looking at Biblical miracles as mere technology, as R. L. Dione did in God Drives a Flying Saucer. \"We trivialize God if we see him as nothing more than a Capt. Kirk wheeling around the Universe. We have to look at the moral side of God,\" he says. Whatever the truth maybe, Downing wants to know it. \"Even if it hurts Christianity, 1 want to know. I don't want to live a lie.\" Downing thinks the govern- ment knows more about UFOs than it is telling, per- haps because officials fear that people could not handle the information. \"Sure it would be disrupting to reli- gion initially,\" he admits, \"but once we get back on track it would be okay. You have to expect revisions in faith-it's sort of a Presbyterian tradition.\" In the meantime, he says the government is depriv- ing him of the right to practice his religion by not re- vealing .what it knows about UFOs. He acknowledges that we may never get all the answers, but until we do learn more, \"we know enough about God's plan to do what we need to do.\" For a detailed, reasonably current view of Downing's views, pick up the latest print ing of The Bible and Fly- ing Saucers, with the new introduction (Marlowe & Co., New York, 1997). Filer's Files By George A. Filer MUFON Eastern Director Majorstar@aol.com 609-654-0020 New York Disks LEVITTOWN, LONG ISLAND — Dave Hagcmeister reports that on Sept. I, 1999, EdG,a well- educated m.irried professional, heard a very unusual throbhiny sound that reverberated throughout his home. It was j i,i|ndly cycling hum or whine-sound; that fluc- tuated ni volume. The strange pulsating gong sound became louder and awakened Ed's wife at 10 p.m. She called out loudly; \"Ed, do you hear that strange noise?\" She parted the bedroom curtains and saw an eerie- blue-glow in their backyard. Ed cautiously opened their front door; to sec a huge disk-shaped UFO, the size of a commercial-airliner, hovering 130 feet high just a few yards above the water-tower several blocks away. The object was a very dark and dull circular disc that tapered from its thin edge all around its perimeter to seven feet thick at its center. The UFO tilted down toward Ed at a 45-dcgrce angle. Ed could see a straight line of a dozen steadily glowing blue-lights, extending from the lower edge directly across its midsection to the edge farthest from him. There was a larger bright blinking blue light at the farthest edge of the object. His wife ran to see the- object move slowly towards the southeast. Ed ran barefoot out of the house and down the street to follow the object, then returned for his camera, but was unable to get a photo. He was surprised to realize that no one else had come outside to investigate the loud throbbing sounds. Three nights later, on Sept. 4, they saw the craft and heard the throbbing-sounds again at 11 p.m. They decided to remain inside in the secu- rity of their home.

Hall Congratulations to Bob Durant and Don Berliner for their excellent investigation report on the August 9, 1997, Swissair UFO encounter, and to Dwight Connelly for the good judgment shown in featuring the case even though it was a very brief event and \"not particu- larly unusual.\" The case is instructive in many ways. As Durant points out, the witness ridicule fac- tor has had a severe impact on (he reportingof UFO phenom- ena over the years, especially by the best qualified witnesses who have so much to lose. Durant strikes exactly the right note in his criticism of government authorities for their hostile attitude when they are forced to deal with, liter- ally, a \"UFO,\" since this very attitude prevents full and complete investigation of potentially important events. The Government investigators feared that the UFO might be a missile, but even less did they want it to be a dreaded U-F-O. The reasonable hypotheses arc very few: (1) a missile of some kind; (2) a fireball meteor, which was adequately investigated and ruled out (more on this below); or (3) a UFO, meaning simply a real, unexplained object of some kind. Unfortunately, \"UFO\" has taken on connotations that prevent it being used as a neutral term. As for fireball meteors, this is a phenomenon that L have studied extensively in the past, even exchanging reports with the late Dr. Charles P. Olivier, Director of the American Meteor Society in the 1960s. He would send me reports from Notice to Mariners by ship's cap- tains annotated \"not meteor.\" In return, 1 would send him reports submitted to N1CAP of apparent meteors annotated \"not UFO.\" Recently I have resumed an interest in fireballs, which on occasion do cause false UFO reports, and I have been gathering and filing reports of them to screen against UFO sightings. In regard to fireballs, I must correct a statement in my last column in which L stated, \"Nor do fireball meteors cast light of such brilliance on the local ter- rain.\" 1 misspoke, because I had forgotten that some very large and long-lasting fireballs do, indeed, illumi- nate the terrain and even clouds. 1 was reminded of this by two very recent fireball sightings reported on meteor and meteorite observation computer sites. The French COMETA report is shaping up to be a first-class controversy. A complete English-lan- guage translation is in the works, funded by Laurance Rockefeller through the Fund for UFO Research. [ts controversial remarks about the claims of Lt. Col. Philip Corso need to be carefully evaluated, but oth- erwise the report appears to be highly significant, es- pecially considering the backgrounds and connections of its corporate authors. Clearly, it treats UFOs as a serious and important matter requiring international cooperation and strategic planning. The news of Walt Andrus' pendjng resignation as International Director was a shocker to many of us, but it is good that the tra/isition to leadership by John Schuessler is being carefully planned, and no doubt will be smoothly implemented. Two matters of possible interest to readers of this column: (1) an essay by me addressing the scientific stereo- types about UFOs will be posted soon on Joe Firmage's International Space Sciences Organization web site: www.theisso.org; (2) a publisher has been found for The UFO Evi- dence: Volume 11, details of which will be announced soon.

The giant planet then proceeds westward across the southern sky. It lies 4 JC<JKVS above the Moon on the 20th. Saturn, in Aries, reaches opposition to the Sun on Nov. 6 at -0.5 magnitude. At that time the ringed world rises in the E at sunset and remains in view all night long. Well placed for northern observers, the big planet gleams at its brightest, and with its largest apparent diameter, in more than 20 years. Saturn can be seen 3 degrees above the Moon on the 2Jst. Bright Planets (Morning Sky) Venus (-4.3) rises in the E about 2:30 a.m. and domi- nates the SE sky thereafter. Jupiter moves to the W where it sets about 4:30 a.m. in midmonth. Saturn advances to the W where it sets near sunrise. Leonid Meteor Storm? Though last year's anticipated Leonid \"storm\" did not pan out, observers in both Europe and North America did report far above average rates of up to 200 to 300 meteors per hour, with many fireballs sighted. This year Leonid forecasters are predicting somewhat better odds for a true meteor storm of up to thousands per hour! Even though Europe and Africa are favored for the best show, U.S. observers should be prepared. The peak activity is uncertain; last year it arrived half a day early. So American watchers would do well to scan the sky beginning at nightfall on the evening of Nov. 17 and extending into the early mom- ing hours of the 18th. A bright gibbous Moon will u 'ash out some of the meteors before midnight. Check for forecast changes in the press or on the Internet. (See Night Sky in October 1998 Journal for more de- tails.) Transit of Mercury For the first time since 1993, the tiny planet Mer- cury crosses in front of the Sun on Nov. 15. The event occurs only 13 or 14 times per century. Hawaii and most of North America, except the northeastern third, can view a grazing transit of Mercury along the Sun's NE edge. From Hawaii the event lasts from around 11:15 a.m. to 12:07 p.m. local time. Observers on the mainland will sec the transit later in the afternoon, al- though somewhat earlier and later, respectively, than the Hawaiian times (for example, earlier than 3:15 and later than 4:07 p.m. CST). For precise local times, consult the November Sky & Telescope. A telescope equipped with a 50 to 100-power eyepiece is required in order to discern'the tiny round black dot of Mer- cury. For eye safety and protection, the Sun's inwgc should be projected through the telescope eyepiece onio a white surface. On a projected view, mercury upward along the extreme right edge of the Sun. Moon Phases: New moon—Nov. 7 First quarter—Nov. 16 Full moon—Nov. 23 Last quarter—Nov. 29 C o The Stars: During mid-evening hours Pegasus and its famous Great Square have drifted W of the celestial meridian in the S. The Northern Cross (alias Cygnus the Swan) stands almost upright in the western sky. Meanwhile some of the Winter Circle constellations—Orion, Tau- rus, Gemini, and Auriga—appear now in the E. In the N the Big Dipper rests on the N horizon in its worst evening viewing position of the year. For lati- tudes below 400, the dipper stars begin to vanish be- low the horizon at this season.

(Continued from Page 19) Arkansas triangle encounter UFOSSI reports that on Sept. 3, 1999, Mike and Henry heard humming noises. Henry saw the head of a grayish white entity 4 to 5 feet tall outside. He heard humming sound in the bedroom that moved around in a counter clockwise circle. Then Henry saw a white softball-size light floating around the house, and he thought he saw another alien. Mike did not see the alien or the light. They went outside and both saw four flashing colored lights in the sky about 50 feet apart on a hovering triangle- shaped craft. The object was about 200 feet wide and moved slowly towards them. They started to back away from the craft as it approached, and then it just disap- peared. Thanks to Billy Dee Washington flying triangle AUBURN — On September 8, 1999, Christopher Montgomery writes, \"We saw a triangular UFO near the UFO Resource Center.\" Around 8:40 p.m. I was working late when Matt came busting into my office to grab the binoculars. Five minutes later we heard the roar of a huge helicopter flying over about ten feet above our roof. Chris ran outside and Matt said, \"I want you to take a look at something!\" I studied an object with three lights tilted at a 25-degree angle be- hind the helicopter. One red light was on top in the center. It moved with a zigzag motion maneuver, in a classic UFO stair-step. It was shaped in a classic triangle UFO which everyone in Auburn and Kent had been reporting for years. It stayed a good 20 minutes."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Page 24 October 1999 MUFON UFO Journal DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE Walter Andrus NEWS FROM AROUND THE NETWORK New Officers State Director for Nebraska John C.
