All these things cost money or time, or both. In addition, printing and paper costs con- tinue to rise. Postage expenses have also in- creased. In short, some sort of increase in sub- scription price is inevitable. The only question is the amount. In deciding on the amount, SKYLOOK and MUFON are.looking at not only the present, but the fu- ture. Can the number of pages in SKYLOOK be ex- panded to include more material we are now un- able to include each month? Can the overall ap- pearance of the magazine be improved? How much can we expect expenses to rise over the next 12 months? How much of what we are now doing by hand should be done by machine if SKYLOOK is to be placed in a secure position where it does not have to depend on so much voluntary labor? We would like to hear from our readers before we reach a final decision. One thing we guaran- tee: SKYLOOK will continue to be the best bargain in UFO magazines, even after the increase in sub- scription rates. - — Dwight Connelly \\ In This Issue Director^ Message More details on Ydnca case~--—- -Astronomy notes —; • — • -. 7 UFO 'emerges from water —•  -. 8 Will President-Ford-open-files? 9 UFO Landing in Italy---— 9 Occupant reported in New Hampshire 10 Close look at UFO in New Hampshire <— 11 UFO flap in New Hampshire —13 UFO in Spain responds to lights 14 Pennsylvania sighting continue 15 Africa UFO observed for hours 16 Argentine UFO's reported 16 Argentine crew reports UFO's 1 Bolivian pilot chases object 1 ~-In Others' Words^  18 Recapping and Commenting- ; 20 NBC Special .De\"a.^lS-—  20 SKYLOOK has been designated the official publication of the ^Mutual UFO-Net\\vork;-however, membership in MUFON is not ^required to subscribe to~Skylook7?and membership in-MUFON does not automatically include~a~subscriptiorTto Skylook.

Visitors from nineteen states and Mexico attended the picnic, most of which was recorded on film by the NBC News film team as part of the UFO Documentary for television-now scheduled for showing on Sunday, Dec. 15, 1974. The growth of MUFON has been so fabulous since our annual UFO Symposium in Akron, OH., that most of this message will be devoted to acknowledging and recognizing the people who provide the leadership in their states, communities, and nations. We are indebted to Ralph and Judy Blum, authors of the current best selling UFO paperback, \"Be- yond Earth—Man's Contact with UFO's,\" for their recommendations to readers to contact MUFON. This book alone has brought in a deluge of inquiries by mail and the volunteered services of many com- petent UFO investigators and researchers. It is anticipated that the tremendous exposure given to MUFON in the new book published by Warner Paper- back Library titled, \"The New UFO Sightings,\" by Glenn McWane and David Graham, will further kindle the postal service deliveries to our door. Several of the chapters in this book are resumes of the speeches given at the 1972 MUFON UFO Con- ference in Quincy, II., and 1973 follow-ups. Glenn McWane is a MUFON State-Section Director for Iowa and has been associated with Brad Steiger in the firm \"Other Dimensions.\" Speaking of recent books, we enthusiastically recommend the hardback written by Raymond E. Fowler titled \"UFO's: Interplanetary Visitors,\" with the Foreword by J. Allen Hynek, published by Exposition Press, Jericho, New York. (See other references to Ray's outstanding book and contri- bution to the field of UFOlogy in Lou Parish's column in this issue of SKYLOOK.) Ray is, with- out a doubt, one of the finest and most thorough field investigators in the United States today. It is with extreme pleasure that we are.an- nouncing the appointment of William H.

(1:15 a.m.) stop- ped on the side of Route 3, 18 kilometers from Bahia Blanca and lived through an amazing exper- ience, according to his version. From a luminous object descended two men and a woman of extra- terrestrial appearance. A group composed of psy- chiatrists and psychologists, a specialist in traumatology, and a hypnotist submitted him to several sessions of hypnosis and pentothal. His story covered several hours; this is the syn- thesis of the tape recordings which the investi- gators made in this amazing case: \"I am dropping, dropping slowly into a pasture field...I feel cold. I get to the road and begin to go along it. I don't know who I am...WHO AM I?...I want to know what time it is, oh I.wish I .could find someone to help-me...Where might there be a police station?.. .Where am I coming .from?...- Where am I going?...Who am I?...\" The above was recorded on tape and stated by a humble youth, named Dionisio Yanca. And today we are listening to him. There is a writing desk, a tape recorder, which at this moment has been stopped, and at the other side a vigorous, robust man of graying hair, serene, affable: it is Doc- tor Eduardo Matas, one of the psychiatrists that formed part of the team which has examined min- utely Dionisio Yanca by means of long and ex- hausting sessions of hypnosis and pentothal. The tape recording rewinds rapidly in the recorder, the apparatus begins to reproduce a new dialogue. The voice of Doctor Eladio Santos, the hypnotist, comes out a bit weak, but sounds clearly, with an accent which inspires .confidence and relaxation. The voice of Dionisio Yanca is lower, monotone and tired. His gasping and at times shortened respiration is heard. —\"Tell me what you were doing after midnight on the 27 of October?\" —\"I am leaving the Esso station on Don Bosco street. I have a punctured tire and .1 will have to change it.\"  . . —\"Where are you travelling?\" \"Along Route 3.\" (The place will later be identified because, on the roadside, on the shoulder, the truck which Yanca was driving was found with the tire jack in .place and with the wheel prepared for making the change.) EDITOR'S NOTE: Additional information concerning the alleged Oct. 28, 1973, con- tact case involving Dionisio Yanca, 25, an Argentine truck driver, has been obtained by Joe Brill, International Coordinator, and translated by Bill Armstrong of St. Louis. As noted in a previous account in the March, 1974, issue of SKYLOOK, no final conclusions - should be drawn on the basis of these second- hand reports. While interesting, details of .the case have not. been verified by competent UFO investigators. As additional information becomes available, it will be reported in .SKYLOOK. —\"What are you doing now?\" —\"I am going to change the tire...There's a yellow light coming..., like the headlights of a Peugeot.\" (Perhaps a car or bus) The voice of Dionisio Yanca is gradually get- ting weaker. Falteringly he responds that .. he feels a great tiredness; a profound fatigue. His state indicates a complete and total collapse. ---\"WHO ARE YOU?...WHAT DO YOU WANT?...No, please don't do anything to me...Take the truck\" and the money...\" —\"Who are you seeing Dionisio?\" ---\"Them, two men, also there is a woman.\" —\"How are they dressed?\" \"Silvery suits, very close fitting to the body and boots and gloves.\" —\"What color are the gloves?\" . —\"Yellow, orange-yellow.\" \"Are they talking to you?\" . —\"No, but I sense a humming, like a hive of bees or a badly, tuned radio.\" ---\"Are they threatening you?\" \"No. One is approaching, takes .my hand and pricks me with an instrument.\" —\"Are they hurting you at all?\" ---\"No.\" ---\"What is this instrument like?\" — \"\"It is similar to an electric shaver.\" —\"What are they doing to you now?\" —\"They are carrying me. Where are they carrying me?\" In the early'dawn of October 28, in a state of total amnesia, Dionisio Yanca arrived at the mu- nicipal Hospital of Bahia Blanca. He had awaken- ed in a pasture field of the Rural Society. He walked or was taken by some automobile to the hospital. The place where he recovered conscious- ness is at some nine kilometers and a half from the point where the truck which he was driving remained parked. • In the interim, there had oc- curred two hours (approximately). Sunday morning Dionisio Yanca is examined by"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Doctor Ricardo Smirnoff, a specialist in trauma- tology and forensic medicine. According to that examination the youth does not show visible lesions, but he resists anyone touching his head, like someone who has localized there a very sore place or a bad headache. Just barely perceived (but atf that moment they are not given much im- portance) are some light scabs on the left eyelid in the form of tiny dots or points. Later this detail will be fundamental in the investigation of the case. The state of confusion continues in Yanca un- til the next day (the 29th), but already he has been able to remember everything that happened from the moment he left .the service station up to \"this point.\" Naturally, \"this point\" is the red signal lighted up on the recorder indicating that the tape has stopped. Dionisio Yanca, the previous night suffered from nightmares. He is tired and depressed. That afternoon he recovers and agrees to the request formulated by the-doctors : to submit, himself to pentothal and establish thus what happened in those two fantastic hours. However, by his ac- count, he left the hospital and moved to the modest house of his uncle located at 1600 Chubut Street. A few days later when the nightmares, with strange beings from another planet in them, continued, distressing him intensely, he came to the office of Doctor Eduardo Matas in search of help. A second session is set up and that night Dionisio Yanca is interviewed by a group of psy- chiatrists directed by Doctor Matas. Some tests are carried, out and the truck driver sketches the identi kit (a particular method of making a sketch, used by most law enforcement agencies to determine, the appearance of a certain person) of the strange visitors. At this point the first major doubt appeared in the investigators con- cerning Yanca 1 s personality and in regard to the veracity of his version: the drawings reproduce the beings much too similar to the heroes of pop- ular comic strips of science fiction.. Days later it will be realized that this doubt, even when it is perfectly founded, also has a solid refuta- tion. An electrpcardiogram was done in order to es- tablish whether he can receive pentothal, and this, step completed, the truck driver returned to the house of his uncle with the promise of pre- senting himself at the office of doctor Matas on the night of November 6: However, that night he does not keep the date, and it is necessary that the doctors go to the humbl-e, little house on Chubut street. Dionisio Yanca has dined abundant- ly and has drunk two glasses of wine; this is sufficient to prevent . the pentothal from being .administered. Instead, the first session of hyp- nosis is .carried out-.  • . The panel of professionals brought together to investigate the Yanca case is directed by Doctors Matas and Santos and made up moreover of two psy- chiatrists, a specialist in traumatology, and two psychologists. One of the conditions imposed, in order that he would agree to this interview, was that the names of- these collaborators would not be disclosed. —\"I'm climbing up with the two men\"... —\"Where are you climbing, on a staircase?\" —\"No, along a ray of light.\" . - —\"Tell me what you are seeing?\". . \"The floor is like lead...silvery, there is only one window and it is round.\" —\"What can you recall about what you are seeing?\" - .- . ---\"Like a ship.\"\" —\"Describe to me everything you see.\" -.--\"There are, many instruments, ' f many,, two televisions, a radio...in one of the televisions are seen the stars..\" ---\"Are they speaking to,.You?\" —\"The radio speaks to me.\" —\"In what language is the radio speaking to you?\" ---\"In Spanish.\" . —\"What are they saying?\" —\"That I should not be afraid, that they are friends, that they have been coming here for a long time.\" . . . . . —\"Do they tell you from where, they come?\" \"They told me that .that is one of their secrets.\" .  - i .;,... , . • . __ , —\"They have-spoken with other, men on earth?\" ---\"Yes, since the year 1950.\" . . : '' ... --.-\"What are they doing?\" •'.<.-. '.'They want to learn if we. can live on their planet.\" .... . ... —\"What is it like where you are?\" --.-\"Illuminated. ..Yellow.. .there is something like : a safe (strongbox).\" —\"What are you looking at now?\" —\"The cigarette lighter. They have it over a table together with my watch and-my pack of cigarettes.\" -,-...,. . . — \"Continue telling us.\" . . -.. —\"The woman, puts on a glove, black, with some little -tacks in. the.palm. ; She approaches. She touches me.\" At that- moment during the hypnotic session Yanca brings his hand to-' his forehead covering (trying to-cover it, better said) the left eye- lid. He recoils* -like someone who feels a prick there and enters into a profound lethargy. When he comes out his next memory is \"I am falling, I am falling' slowly; into' a pasture : field...They have tcld me that they will come again to'look for me...1 -feel cold...I arrive on the road and I begin to walk oh\" it...Who am I...? Who am I..:?\" In a state of hypnosis Dionisio Yanca repro- duces the moment of total amnesia experienced on waking .up in the pasture •field' of the Rural . Society. • After that first session of hypnosis there will follow .two others and one session with pentothal. Everything'said 'by Dionisio Yanca has been recorded in several hours of tape record- ings. In each one of the. sessions the truck driver repeats exactly'the same story without any contradictions. But, it -is worth mentioning that"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"it is noticed that it is under the pentothal when Yanca has revealed complementary details which did not appear under hypnosis. —\"Doctor Matas, are you in agreement with the results of this investigation?\" (Asked by the reporter writing this article) \"No, and I would like to explain. We have committed many errors. Listening closely to the first recording, for example, one can notice that there are some questions which carry implicitly the answer. This was corrected when the hypnosis was conducted exclusively under the direction of Doctor Eladio Santos.\" —\"How do you explain, scientifically the not- able similarity between the identi kit made by Dionisio Yanca of these supposed extraterrestrial beings with the conventional illustrations from the comic strips?\" ---We have compared the sketches of Yanca with the illustrations made by Mr. and Mrs. Hill in the United States in 1961, and the similarity is truly astonishing. Although this does not dis- miss that primary objection, it does follow, on the other hand, that the Hill's were attended and treated by means of psychiatry and hypnosis.\" —\"What other similarities are there between the experience of Mr. and Mrs. Hill, a married couple who were apparently taken on board a fly- ing object during a period of two hours, -and the case of Dionisio Yanca?\" —\"Amnesia at the moment immediately following the contact, fatigue, nightmares, hallucinations. The picture in both cases retains a great simi- larity.\" —\"Is it probable that the knowledge of the Hill case on the part of the investigators might have induced in Yanca the replies that might favor moreover your expectations?\" —\"No, for most of us the Hill case was hard- ly a reference. The book which John Fuller wrote on that story which is called \"The Interrupted Journey\" I read only after beginning the Yanca case. However, I would like to make the warning (or give the notice) that all this process has been contaminated by those initial errors in such a way that one cannot attribute a total veracity to what Yanca has said, not even in the state of hypnosis or under the effect of the pentothal.\" —\"In what degree did Yanca 1 s conduct change or vary since then?'.' —\"Although his outward and daily conduct was modified (and this cannot be related because it pertains to the clinical history of the patient) this does not invalidate the worth of his story: you have observed the coherence of all of his stories. In each session he has repeated exactly the same story. A hoaxer, for example, would have tried to be more precise, to point out de- tails. Yanca related everything he observed with his limited vocabulary and with the same limited imagination which he has revealed in the tests which were given to him.\" It is already past mid-day and we have to stop for lunch, immediately afterward we will.be going with Doctor Matas to the country estate of Doctor Eladio Santos. —\"Is Yanca telling-the truth Doctor Santos?\" — -\"HE TELLS HIS TRUTH. I was the greatest skeptic in the group on beginning this investi- gation, and now the only thing I can say is that submitted to methods which in normal practice are confidently acceptable, like hypnosis and pento- thal, he has said what he belives he has lived through.\" —\"By means of those methods up to what point is the truth discernible which the subject feels, lives, and transmits, compared with the truth which is objective and is real?\" \"That is exactly the limit of the ques- tion...\" Now, we have arrived at a critical point: to the defects in the method employed (recognized by Doctors Matas and Santos) is added an unavoidable question: the truth such as each one of us can perceive it cannot coincide with the objective truth, depersonalized, if we may be permitted to use that word, not to correct, but illustrative. —\"Are the treatments with hypnosis or pento- thal infallible?\" ---\"There is no infallible method. But in the traditional cases it does make it possible for the subject to recall the memories kept in the sub-conscious. On freeing internal barriers and repressions, the subject cannot control himself and tells his truth.\" —\"But even thus is it possible to lie?\" —\"It is possible. But, besides the hypnosis, Yanca has been submitted to an exhaustive psy- chiatric examination. His life has been gone over minutely. His past has been traced patiently and there are no indications that might suggest that he has lied to us. Naturally his story is not sufficiently conclusive to establish firmly his contact in a spaceship with extraterrestial be- ings. On the other hand, the analysis of Yanca's personality refutes the possibility that, he might be a hoaxer.\" Patiently we have listened through several long hours the tapes recorded with the stories of Yanca in search of some fallacies. They do not appear. He uses simple words in accord with his habitual language and his cultural level. He is not a \"charlatan.\" He needs to be stimulated with questions. When he cannot answer about the action which is transpiring at that moment, he answers invariably, \"I wish I knew...I don't know...\" Under the effects of pentothal his story (burdened with the heaviness of mind caused by the drug) becomes somewhat more precise. There he indicates that the ship has an ox-eye and also he tells that at one moment while he was on board they connect \"two tubes,\" one to a high voltage tower, the other to a little lake. At that hour, on that day, the consumation of electric energy increased substantially, but the experts explain- ed that this could have been due to various"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"causes. Coincidence, or something more? Yanca had problems in the case of his uncle. He went away to Trelew and there he worked at his trade as a truck driver. He had a sweetheart, Marta Gaitan, whom he had met after his strange adventure. The girl has already purchased her bridal gown and is planning to get married. But the young man has not written to her since-two months ago. She knows nothing of him nor can his attitude be explained. Marta wrote a letter to his parents and they answered that they did not want to know anything about him and that they had prohibited him from coming back to his home in Ingeniero.Jacobacci, a suburb.in the province of Rio Negro. . • Yanca's contact with .the supposed extraterres- trial beings began; at 1:15 a.m., and concluded in the early dawn in a pasture field. The story which he gives has then lapses in time. --^\"Effectively. We; have reconstructed the road apparently covered by Yanca from the moment in which he woke .up and shortly after he knew from some truck driver- that it was after three o'clock in the morning. He remembers that he has lost his watch. His story now already in the in- terior of the flying object covers approximately one half hour. This means that there is a period in his life (one and a half hours to two hours) which is sunk in a total amnesia.\" —\"Is it not possible to recover that portion of time which he has experienced with the methods used?\" \"We have not succeeded in doing so.\" —\"Is it probable that the supposed extra- terrestrials might have erased from his memory the recall of what occurred in that time?\" —\"One can suppose so.\" —\"In a manner that not either hypnosis or pentothal has been 'able to recover that time which lacks?\" ---\"I have already said : that. It has not been possible.\" The conclusion which the Doctors Matas and Santos formulated concerning the \"Yanca Case\" can be summarized as follows: \"We need in the future to avoid the errors that we have committed through lack of an • adequate technique. It is necessary that investigators take all precautions in order to avoid that the information received may be contaminated; Also, there exists a great responsibility on the part of the media of dif^ fusion (press, radio, T.V. and so forth). It is necessary to remove all semblance of sensationalism from events which, although they escape our traditional methods of knowledge, can- not therefore be dogmatically denied or refuted. We have no way of proving that Yanca was not in a Flying. Saucer. Nor do we have a method capable of proving that he was.- Dionisio Yanca has recounted under hypnosis and pentothal always the same story. And his story is that he was in a flying saucer with two tall,,.blond men with short hair and a blond woman with long hair, that those beings had silver-colored suits, r.that they spoke among themselves-with.a.-murmuring similar Astronomy Notes By Mark Herbstritt SEPTEMBER SKY MERCURY is too close to the sun for observation until the end of the month.

Argentine groups dedicated to investigating the UFO phenomenon, including the Tracking Com- mission for Extraterrestrial Bases (CORBE) and the Center for Investigations of Extraterrestrial Phenomena (CIFE) have attempted to study this and other cases. Edgarde Luis Abrego and Oswaldo Anabitarte, of CIFE, who think they have located the site of the alleged encounter, near the ser- vice station \"El Chole,\" were unable to find any- thing there to aid them in their investigation. The two investigators did loeate a man (unidenti- fied) who indicated that at approximately 9:30 p. m. or 10:00 p.m. (date not given; presumably it was Oct. 27) he and his wife observed a very strong and very large light which after several minutes disappeared instantaneously. Yanca has told investigators that the occu- pants were humanoid, tall, blond, had slanting and protruding eyes, broad forehead, and were dressed in one-piece light gray (silver) suits which were close-fitting and similar to those used by frogmen. He said the encounter occurred as he was preparing to change a tire on his truck. Yanca said he noticed a light some 3,000 meters behind him, which was approaching rapidly. After turning around he saw three beings, who raised him up by taking hold of his shirt collar. He said the object was located about ten meters away, and was about four meters off the ground. The object was described by Yanca as a brilliant yellow color, and violet on the base. It was a- bout four meters in diameter, and his description was judged by investigators to be similar to a saucer-shaped object photographed over New Jersey in the U.S. in 1952."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Witness says UFO came out of water i MUFON investigator Robert D. Neville has sub- mitted the following account of his interview with Frank S. Kinsey, conducted Nov. 3, 1973: It...\"was about ten years ago,\" (Circa 1964) Mr. Kinsey begins. \"It was down behind the hills in Ventura, Ca., where the government put in a new dam up there.\" (Casitas Dam.) \"It was a drizzly day--cloudy.\" He estimated the-time of day as 11 a.m. \"My brother-in-law took me up there. We were standing there, chatting for a- bout ten or fifteen minutes and then, all of a sudden, I heard sort of a loud noise and water splashing, and I looked out into the lake and here's this object coming out of the water.- \"I was so flabbergasted...! was speechless to think I could see something like that which I've never seen before...And'it was a round object and it looked like it had a cone on top, where a per- son was looking out at us. I had a camera around my neck, but I completely forgot the camera due to the fact that I was so astounded\" to see some- thing like this coming up out of the water.

Mr. Kinsey noted that the object appeared to be a- bout 20 or 30 feet in height, and that inside it \"looked like a being looking out at us,\" a human- oid form. \"I could see the eyes staring at us. I happened to have a pair of binoculars with me at the time. I picked them up and looked and could see a person looking out at me. \"It looked like it was a real thick heavy glass of some kind, or maybe it might have been a plastic of some kind—you know, never seeing anything like that before.\" Mr. Kinsey noted that the object or a portion of the object ap- peared to be rotating rapidly upon its axis. \"What was moving on the object was the outside cylinder. It was turning around at a very high rate of speed...It made an awful loud noise like a jet taking off.

The faster it turned (the more) it changed color, as though it were transparent, and lights were going through it. \"When it came up out of the water, it was like a funnel sucking up water.

He is a very respected member of the community.and a very out- spoken and direct individual. In this investiga- tor's opinion, Mr. Kinsey's familiarity with con- ventional aircraft and his unquestioned honesty and sincerity provide this report with a high de- gree of credibility in spite of its very unusual content. The only other known witness to the sighting (Mr. Kinsey's brother-in-law) is now deceased."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Will President Ford open files on UFO's?

President Ford, while House minority leader, courageously urged open congressional hearings on the subject of UFOs. Ford's carefully worded statement on UFOs, re- leased April 21, 1966, called for open investiga- tion by the House of Representatives, to include testimony by reliable witnesses to UFO phenomena. The complete text of Ford's historic news re- lease in 1966 follows: \"The Air Force has informed me it is arranging for a study by high-caliber scientists of some of the UFO sightings which have never been ex- plained. \"This study will be placed under contract soon after July 1, start of the new fiscal year.

The UFO had a spherical shape, and from its base it was emitting an intense yellowish light which later turned to red, and on its upper sec- tion it had a sort of very extended antenna. According to the witnesses the object did not give off any sound, and after remaining-station- ary for some ten minutes it took off suddenly, climbing at a high velocity. Police patrols which were dispatched and went to this place where the mysterious sphere landed found the grass and the soil burnt. Among the numerous witnesses, who claimed to have seen the landing of the UFO are included a city policeman, Ugo Ragnij who was in the company of his daughter Giovanna when at about 23:30 hrs. (11:30 p.m.) he observed in the sky a luminous point which was approaching the earth at a ter- rific speed (velocity). The police officer stated that together with'his daughter and other persons he remained sometime, watching the flying saucer, motionless, on the ground and that he ap- proached to within about four hundred meters from the UFO. This is the second' appearance within a little more than 48 hours of an unidentified flying Ob- ject in Italy.

SYNOPSIS This is an interesting report of a midnight landing of a UFO with an occupant seen to egress from the craft. The sighting duration is fairly long, but unfortunately only one witness is in- volved and his background is questionable. The sighting occurred onthe tide line of an ocean beach in New Hampshire. The witness, whose name must be kept confi- dential\", was swimming alone at the beach at Hamp- ton Beach, N.H., at about midnight on Monday, May 20, 1974 (0 hr. EOT). He lives in nearby Hampton. He saw a disc-shaped object approach horizontally over the ocean, then make a vertical descent over the beach and land. .The craft was 50-60 ft. in diameter and domed both above and below with a sort of rim. It had four legs with pads on the ends, several (running?) lights, and radiated heat. The UFO had -a humming and/or pulsing sound, apparently throughout the encounter. The UFO may have sat on the beach some minutes before a hatch folded down from the underside of the craft as if it were hinged on one side. A ramp then slid out the hatch opening, apparently with a humanoid standing on it. At this .time (about 12:30 a.m.) a separate electrical motor sound could be heard over the \"pulsing hum\" eman- ating from the UFO (did the motor sound appear to come from within the UFO?). The occupant was 6 ft. or more in height and dressed in a type of coverall from head to foot (some confusion here: was it a one-piece suit, was it light-colored?). Evidently the witness thought the suit was somewhat bulky. Two hoses (respirator?) ran from about the rear of the jaw bones to a junction at the back of the neck, then one hose continued down to the back. The human- oid stepped to the sand for only seconds, where- upon he returned inside the craft which closed up and lifted off in the reverse sequence. The wit- ness reported \"a wetness\" about 70-80 yd. from the occupant as he egressed from the bottom of the UFO. The entire sighting lasted between 20 and 60 minutes. As soon as the UFO left, the witness examined landing imprints with his flashlight. Where the four pads had sat on the sand there was a deep rose-colored paste with a thick liquid in them. The prints were deep and large (no sizes), partly because the landing occurred in the tideline area while the tide was at least part way out. There was also a spot of the rose-colored material on the sand under where the hatch had opened. By morning the tide had removed all traces except that there was still a trace of red where the hatch had opened. The sighting area is in Rockingham County a- bout 1600 feet north of the north bank of the Hampton River and its junction with the Atlantic Ocean. The coordinates are N 42 54'03\"; W70 48'41.4\". The area is 1.8 mi. due east of a pro- posed site for a nuclear power generating sta- tion. The site is in a salt marsh in Seabrook, N.H. Work:is underway to test.feasibility of con- struction. Tubes used to cool the processed water from the plant will be put under the marsh and exit at the ocean at the beach where the landing occurred. No other reports have yet surfaced from this night in the Hampton area. However, a close ap- proach sighting did occur in Nashua, N.H., about 35 minutes west some 3-4 hours before the Hamp- ton Beach report. Investigation is pending on this one. The area around Hampton has been a \"hot\" one for good, low-level reports for some time. It lies within 10 miles of Exeter, where the famous 1965-66 concentrations took place. Evidence ex- ists that the area has never really stopped being active. Hampton is the place where an alleged landing with an occupant also occurred in 1973. Attempts to trace this report have met in fail- ure. A very recent sighting took place on June 6 in South Hampton when 5 people in one car ob- served an inverted mushroom-shaped object emmit- ting sparks (see following article). Pease AFB is .in Portsmouth, only 10 miles east of both Exeter and the Hampton area. Of further note is that Goffstown, N.H., the scene of two important humanoid reports in early November, 1973, is 40 miles west .of Hampton Beach. THE INVESTIGATION This report is composed almost entirely of material given me by John Oswald who lives in this area of N.H. Less than 24 hours after the sighting, the employer of the witness phoned John about the sighting. -John then held a one-hour taped interview with the witness on May 21. Checks with the local, police and Coast Guard net- ted no reports for that evening. The day after the sighting the witness told the tale to his employer to get it . \"off his chest.\" The employer indicates the man is pleas- ant and a good worker. The witness is 32 years old. John reports that he 'does have some.mental problems; at least he is somewhat \"simple- minded.\" Also he reported a similar UFO sighting 2 years ago (see below).

Heading home in Mrs. Mispilkin's dark green Volkswagen station wagon, they proceeded down Fern avenue and turned left on Route 150, also known as Exeter road. As they came around the corner, Richard, who was sitting on the right side of \"the car, saw something in the sky. \"Look at that bright light up there,\" Mrs. .Stevens recalled her son saying. The other occupants of the car also saw the .bright object. At first she thought ,that it was a light on a tower, Mrs. Stevens said later. But it seemed to follow the car north along Route 150. As the Volkswagen approached Locust street, the thing appeared closer and larger. \"When we came to take a right hand turn to come down here, it shot over,\" Mrs. Stevens said, indicating that the object crossed'the angle be- tween route 150 and Locust street. \"It got ahead of us and stayed in front of us, right over the tree in the pasture.\" As they reconstructed the scene Monday after- noon, Mrs. Stevens and Mrs. Mispilkin pointed out a prominent elm tree in an overgrown pasture which was on their left as they turned on to Locust. The tree is about 100 feet from the road. \"There was no sound at all to the thing,\" Mrs. (Continued from preceding page) cally healthy, a good worker, cheerful, likeable, and a serious Christian., He claims never to have read any UFO books and, in fact, says the only book he reads is the Bible. Oswald does not be- lieve that such a simple person could fabricate a UFO report with all the detail and \"classic\" UFO character reported. The witness' older report occurred again on an 'isolated beach, this time on Lake Champlain near Burlington, Vt. The UFO was chalk-white and landed in daylight on the beach. It was shaped like a double convex lens and also had legs. He observed it for 30 minutes to an hour before the UFO took off. No occupant was seen. John reports the witness is willing to take a lie detector test. John is continuing his in- vestigation, concentrating on the man's back ground. Obviously many questions still remain.

UFO sketch derived from witness descriptions Stevens said. \"There were all colored lights on it. A red light would come on and a green light would come on.\" Mrs. Stevens made a drawing of the object she saw. It was like a child's top, she said, except that the bottom was round instead of pointed. The bottom part was like a bowl, perhaps 15 or 20 feet across, \"not quite as big as my swim- ming pool,\" Mrs. Stevens said. The round pool in her yard is 24 feet in diam- eter. On top of this was a smaller section which appeared to be about five feet across. There was a red light on the top part. The bottom part seemed to have brilliant lights a- round its edge. The red lights seemed particu- larly bright. \"It was red, then it was blue, then it was green, then all colors at once,\" Mrs. Stevens said. In the center, between the two parts, there was a white light that seemed to shoot sparks. \"I could kind of see something in it, spinning around,\" Mrs. Stevens said. The two women and the two children went into the Stevens home, a small white house about 200 yards from the corner. \"They told Mrs. Stevens, son, Todd, who was graduated this Sunday from Amesbury High School, and his girfriend, Kathy Ouellette, about what they had seen. Todd and Kathy left soon after the others arrived. They did not see anything unusual on the way to Kathy's home in Amesbury. Todd. left Kathy at her house on High street. As he turned down Locust street on his way home, he saw the same bright object, still above the 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"elm tree in the pasture. \"He came in and said, 'Mama, it's still there,'\" Mrs. Stevens remembered. \"So we all jumped in the car and went down to see it.\" This time they crossed Route 150 and went a short distance up Highland Road, which goes up a hill past the home of Mr. and Mrs. Frank Cynewski Jr. From their vantage point on the hill, they could see the object clearly. It appeared to be about 400 feet away at this point, still near the big elm. The thing was not entirely motionless. \"It just stayed there and kind of wavered,\" Mrs. Stevens said, describing a kind of flutter- ing motion with her hand. The various observers had diverse reactions to the phenomenon that they watched. Mrs. Stevens, a widow and mother of five, thought that it was exciting. \"That thing was so beautiful,\" she said later. \"I'd love to go up in it, as long as they brought me back.\" Mrs. Mispilkin admitted that she was frightened by the thing. Todd Stevens seemed unimpressed. As they watched the thing from the rise on Highland road, Mrs. Stevens decided to go into the Cynewski's house and tell them about the ob- ject. Just as she left, an airplane approached the area and the thing began to descend on an angle into the pasture or the sandpit which lies behind the field. \"It didn't move smooth. It would waver like and jet like,\" Mrs. Mispilkin recalled. As the object sank from view, a bright red glow lighted the field from somewhere behind the elm. Todd Stevens noticed that the plane seemed noisy in contrast to the thing they had been watching, which was silent. By the time Muriel Cynewski came out of her house with Mrs. Stevens, the object had disap- peared. There was nothing unusual to be seen ex- cept the circling aircraft. Mrs. Stevens and her family returned home. They went outside again about 11 p.m. and heard what sounded like more than one aircraft, still circling the field where the bright object had disappeared. None of those who saw the strange object re- ported the incident at first because, Mrs. Stevens said, they felt that no one would believe them. On Monday, however, Mrs. Stevens called Pease Air Force Base in Portsmouth, hoping to ob- tain some information about what she had seen. But the Air Force did not tell her anything, Mrs. Stevens said. Instead she was asked to des- cribe what she had seen and advised to report the incident to the local police, which she did. Her account of the sighting was tape recorded by the Air Force, Mrs. Stevens said. Word of the incident was passed on by the press How Mrs. Stevens drew the object to Raymond E. Fowler of Wenham, who belongs to the National Investigating Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP). \"They have given a perfect description of what many other people have seen\" Fowler told the News Monday night. \"For some reason or other, the southern New Hampshire area has been a hotbed of sightings,\" he added. Mr. Fowler contacted John Oswald of North Hampton who has long been active in the effort to obtain scientific information about strange ob- jects like the one seen by Mrs. Stevens and her family. Oswald spoke to the five witnesses to the in- cident for .several hours Monday night and again Tuesday morning. On the basis of these inter- views, he concluded that they saw something which is unknown on this planet. \"I don't see any reason not to take their story at face value,\" Oswald commented later, noting that three adults and two children had viewed the object over a prolonged period of time and from a fairly close range. \"Information from their viewing pretty much rules out anything of terrestrial origin,\" he added. Oswald noted that UFO sightings in the Exeter, New Hampshire, area routinely involve a brightly lighted flying object which follows a car and then hovers over a field before disappearing. But he felt that the thing seen by Mrs. Stevens and her family had some unique features. \"It was quite an unusual UFO, a rare bird,\" he said. He said that he preferred not to comment fur- ther until he had discussed the results of his interviews with Raymond Fowler and others knowl- edgeable on the subject. Oswald said that the aircraft which arrived on the scene of the sighting could have been directed to the area by radar operators at Pease AFB who had picked up an unidentified object on their screens. But it would be impossible to confirm this theory, he added. The Air Force routinely re- fuses to release information on such incidents. 12"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"UFO flap reported in New Hampshire The Lakes Region of New Hampshire appear to be one of the current UFO hot spots as numerous sightings are reported and citizens turn out in droves to \"skywatch.\" The current wave got underway on Sunday, Aug. 11, as reported by MUFON Investigator Larry Spei- gel: Early in the morning of August 11, Tilton police officers Mark Paine and Mike Alden were dispatched to 1-93 to watch for and stop a sus- pect automobile. They were sitting in their cruiser facing west and watching the southbound lane for the car that never showed up. They radioed in a normal timecheck at 3:30 a.m. At 3:31 a.m., the dispatcher at the Belknap County Sheriff's office received a transmission from the Tilton cruiser stating they had what ap- peared to be a UFO in sight, south-west of their position, at the Sanbornton turn-around. Between 3:31 and 3:47 Deputy Steve Hodges of the sheriff's department verified the sighting. Meanwhile, the Belmont cruiser was on its way to the scene. They had a camera in thir cruiser and they were going to attempt to v photograph the object. At 4:00 a.m. the Belmont cruiser arrived at the scene. Officer Michael McCarty and Special Officer Norman Stanley confirmed the sighting. Within the next fifteen minutes the Gilford cruiser joined the other two cruisers at the turn-around. Significant of the arrival of the Gilford cruiser is the fact that the officer in the cruiser spotted the object before he joined the other cruisers. iThis confirmation can be heard on the tape that the Tilton officers had running at the time. The Tilton, Belmont, and Gilford officers lined up their cruisers in a straight line con- figuration- -Tilton in front, Belmont center, and Gilford in the rear. They proceeded to flash their blue -lights in alternating sequences in order to try to get a response from the object. It is still uncertain as to whether a definite response from the object was observed. At 4:19 Officer Alden observed a second object. At 4:30 Officer Paine observed a third object. The three objects now visible to the officers formed a triangular formation: the first in the southwest, the second in the northwest, and the third to the east/southwest. Between 4:39 and 4:41 a fourth object was seen rising at a high rate of speed and appeared to be heading south toward Concord. At 5:02 a.m. the Belmont curiser left the turn- around to resume its normal patrol. For the .next couple of minutes (5:03-5:04) an unusual amount of light activity was observed from the three objects in the triangular forma- . tion. It looked as if the objects were\" beaming lights to each other. As this light activity continued, the objects were noted to ,be rising. At 5:11 Deputy Hodges left the scene and at 5:17 the Tilton police left the scene. Tape recordings were made of the sightings by officers Alden and Paine, excerpts of which fol- low: ALDEN: \"At .times it is silhouetted in the sky,' about a quarter mile away... It just dove away.\" ALDEN: \"We flash our blue lights at.it, and it seems to flash back. It just wheeled around, swiveling around, with blue and red lights. It's now about a half to a quarter mile away. The lights get bright, then dull. When we flash lights, it responds by changing colors.\" VOICE: \"I don't know about you but I'm nervous as hell. Look at 'em moving,- Look at 'em change! It's coming at us. Look at 'em dive!\" VOICE: \"We see a beam from time to time come down'from it...when we flash our blues it gets closer—flash the blues. Be advised that this 'thing is signaling us back.\" • (Sounds of light switch clicking on and off.) VOICE: \"You know what's going to happen? We're going to be called a bunch of lunatics.\" At one-time during the sighting, Alden said the object moved to within a thousand yards. At this point an outline could be observed. \"It seemed to be saucer-shaped,\" he said. Paine said the object was eliptical in shape, with a dome on top of it. He said the object was about 30 to 50 feet in diameter. Dr. William K. Widger of Biospheric Consultants International in Meridith noted that while some UFO reports may be generated by aircraft lights and meteor-showers, some reports, such as those by officers Alden and Paine \"simply defy rational explanation.\" The month of August, he explained, is noted for meteor showers, and the area had been undergoing these in recent weeks. Recent military flight operations in the lakes region could also have accounted for some sightings, he said. Numerous sightings have been reported to police . in the area over a period of several days, espec- ially from Tilton, Guilford, and Belmont. Among the many reports were: --A \"landing\" 'on top of Belknap Mountain. --A \"cone-shaped object with a green tint and a red glow on the bottom\" over the lake in the Weirs Beach area. --A \"hot dbg or saucer-shaped\" object over Lake Opechee with \"red, green, and white lights.\" --A report by Kathy Lagiuex, 12, that her en- tire family saw an \"orange egg-shaped object\" go across the sky at Prescott Hill. The object was \"very bright\" and was being followed by three airplanes. \"It dropped something and then we saw it go behind a mountain and disappear. It then started coming up over the mountain and.was puls- ating.\" She said the object was moving much faster than the planes. --\"Blue and white lights\" over Lake Winne- pesaukee which \"hesitated and then took off.\" 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"UFO in Spain responds to lights Date of Actual sighting: June 14,1974 Location of sighting: Medellin, Spain Source: Newspaper \"Pueblo,\" June 22, 1974, by J.

The sighting allegedly involved in- telligent behavior by the UFO, as well as the precsence of occupants. The reporter investiga- ing the incident has described the witness as a \"simple and, according to my judgment, stable worker, incapable of imagining such a thing.\" The sighting reportedly took place near the castle of Medellin. \"I was going that morning,\" Santiago is saying, \"still at night toward the farm of my father. On passing that grove of trees, a strong light struck me in the eyes. I saw a very strange pot- shaped object which was flying at a low altitude. I would estimate it at about 100 meters altitude; it was travelling at an incredible velocity, as rapid as I could follow with my eyes. It was to one side of the castle. As the apparatus was coming toward me an overwhelming fear filled my body. It occurred to me to turn out the lights of the car and to continue in second gear very slowly. My body was trembling all over. I tell you that you have to see how imposing a thing like that is.   . \"The fact is that the apparatus was following me at about 70 meters on my right. When I got to that hill I turned my lights on again and the apparatus came toward me again at a great velocity only to go away again when I turned the lights out once more. I.got to the farm and saw that it was staying near the gate at an altitude of about 100 meters, although sometimes it would climb up and at times come back down. My first intention was to shut myself up in the house, so I did this. Then, a little braver, I went out clutching a pitchfork .(hayfork) just in case... Imagine the fear which filled me so much that I even thought about running toward the mountain where I know some very good places to hide my- self...\" Apparently there are still remnants of that panic in his body. Santiago speaks with complete lucidity re-telling step by step what he saw. At times he feels a shiver—a shiver which comes with the memories. \"When I went out of the house, it was stopped over the farm. The light that was coming from the apparatus was so strong that it seemed like it was daytime. It was then that I thought of turning the headlights of the car on it to see what was happening.. It came at me like a flash of lightning. I turned the lights out and it then remained quiet for awhile, and then began to move up and down.\" \"How was the apparatus moving about?\" \"At a high velocity and rotating on its own axis, although at times it also would make a zig zag or would remain motionless or move like a pendulum. At one moment it looked like a star and the next moment it was right beside me. At times it appeared to me that it was moving like a whirlwind. You know?; but like an unbelievable whirlwind...In short I don't have any words to explain this very well.\" \"What was its form?\" \"Underneath or below it was round with a kind of tower which terminated in a point on top. The round part was transparent and from the interior came out an intense yellow light. The tower shone like metal... \"You say that it was transparent. Did you see anything in its interior at the times when the object eame near to you?\" \"Yes. I,saw-clearly three men.

That I believe, at least, because I have never seen anything similar...Those, who might wish to study the matter, those who believe ,may ask me whatever they wish.\" \"The time at which it was.closest to you, at what distance was it from you?\" \"About fifty meters. It was terrible, impres- sive and so silent and so brilliant...Now, I don't go out anymore in the early morning. Before going to the farm I wait until the Sun rises.\" This is the story and testimony of . Santiago Pulido. But there are also other people of the town who claim to have seen the object. A young man, for example, who was.going from La Oliva to Medellin saw it from the highway. It was report- edly observed by two citizens of San Benito. And also it was said that two traffic police officers had said to some friends in. the town that they also saw it. at it. In a few minutes another car came up be- hind the couple and the light just dimmed out and disappeared. The witnesses, upon arriving home, called the state police arid they referred- the call to us. Prior to the above report, on April 13, a num- ber of cases of low level UFO activity were re- ported near the Westinghouse Waltz Mills Nuclear Plant. These reports described an elongated silver object that was hovering at an altitude of a few hundred feet. The object had one very bright light in front. The next day a mechanical engineer and his family driving on 1-70 near Waltz Mills observed a UFO at 8 p.m. The object that they observed appeared to be slightly larger than a Cessna aircraft. When it first was ob- served it was falling straight down out of the sky and they thought it was a plane going to crash. The object suddenly stopped about a hun- dred feet above the tree line. The object then disappeared behind the tree line. Actually the only thing that was seen were 5 red lights that gave the impression that they were all connected. At about the same time, residents near Latrobe were phoning in reports of a circle of red lights. that hovered low in the sky, then moved .away at a fast pace toward Greensburg. State Police sent a car to the Waltz Mills area to check the re- port after they notified us. .Even though not unidentified, on the evening of April 19 at 8:15 p.m. hundreds of observers watched a bright white bolide (exploding meteor), pass over a large area. The meteor was observed over the states of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maryland, and West Virginia. Ted Phillips to speak in St. Louis Sept. 15 Ted Phillips, Skylook staff member and MUFON secretary, will be the guest speaker at the fall meeting of the UFO Study Group of Greater St. Louis, Inc., on Sunday,. Sept. 15 at 3 p.m. at the Community Meeting Room of the Farm and Home Loan Association Bank, 7801 Forsyth, Clayton. Phillips, an inspector with the Missouri State Highway Department, will speak on \"UFO Landings: A. Case for Physical Evidence.\" .Phillips, of Sedalia, Mo., has conducted specialized research on physical traces found at alledged UFO landing sites for the past five years. His world-wide files contain over 650 physical landing trace re- ports,- and he is considered the foremost author- ity in the. United States on UFO traces left be- hind after reported landings. He recently became the specialization coordinator for MUFON. - Phillips' talk will be open to the general public, free of charge. 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"African UFO observed for several hours Date of actual sighting: June 14, 1974 Location of sighting: -Hattingspruit, Natal, South Africa Investigated by: Carl Van Vlierden, MUFON Repre- sentative for South Africa. Submitted through Joe Brill, International Coordinator' Five witnesses reportedly watched a UFO with portholes for a period of hours in the early morning of June 14. The principal witness, Mr. I.D. McCallum, 31, first saw the object about 5 a.m. when he arose to go to the bathroom. Looking out the window to check the weather, he observed the UFO, which was emitting an intense white light. Instead of the rain which had been fore- cast, the stars were shining brightly. \"During the first hour of observation,\" Mc- Callum explains, \"the -UFO snaked along at a leisurely pace with 8 intensely bright lights shining towards the ground almost as if it was looking for something. There was no sound, and I estimate the size as approximately as big as a Boeing 737 without wings or tail (the object was cigar-shaped).  ' \"It emitted a reddish light on end view and moved in the direction of the flash each time a flash was emitted. \"At 6 a.m. the UFO switched off the side lights and almost resembled a star. After sunrise the craft could still be seen with the lights shining and the sun reflecting off the body.\" In addition to Mr. McCallum, four others watch- ed the object: Mrs. McCallum, Mrs. 1 L. Martin, Mr. 0. W. Haschke, and Mr. R. Fortman. The latter three witnesses reportedly viewed the object at Dabmar Engineering, where Mr. McCallum works. All reportedly viewed the object through-binoculars. Mr. McCallum explains that \"between 5 a.m. and 6 a.m., when the craft was still low, no photo- graphs were taken because we did not have suita^- ble equipment or telephoto lens. Nobody was call- ed because we did not know when it would disap- pear. From 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. the craft started ascending-, and it resembled the morning star in brightness before sunrise. After sunrise it was still visible if one-was shown the position.\" Mr. McCallum reports that his wife suffered \"arc eyes\" from watching the-intense light of the UFO. No other effects were reported. \"The arc eyes received by my wife from the light' of the craft must have been caused between 5 and 6 a. m.,\" McCallum explains, \"as she preferred to view the craft with -the naked eye than with the binoculars which I used all the time except for the one occasion when she did make use of them.\" Mr. McCallum concludes: \"Well, all I can say is whoever it was, what a pity they are so reluctant to make contact with people on Earth-in general.\" The two ' drawings above were sketched by the witness. The drawing at the left is the end view of the object, while the drawing to the right is the side view. Mr. McCallum said he could not see the ends of the object when the side view was presented, due to the light coming from the \"portholes\" and shining toward the ground. The object was viewed through 10x50 binoculars. Argentine UFOs reported Date of Actual Sighting: July 11, 1974 (Thurs- day) Location: Managua, Granada and Mazaya, Argen- tina ' Name of Newspaper: \"La Nueva Provincia\" (Bahia Blanca, Argentina), July 12, 1974 Submitted by: Joe Brill Translated by: Bill Armstrong Managua, 12 (Associated Press) - Authorities of the Air Force and of the Army affirmed that persons from various points of the country re- ported seeing last night (July 12th) an unidenti- fied flying object. Mateo Gonzalez, a radio operator at the con- trol tower at the international airport of this city, said that the object \"was three times larg- er than the full moon\" and was giving off \"an in- tense light.\" . Colonel Orlando Gutierrez, commander of the National Guard in Granada, a town forty-five kil- ometers to the southeast, said that he saw the object about 19:00 hrs. . (7:00 p.m.). \"At first when I observed it I thought it was an aircraft, but it was shining with green and red lights which illuminated a good part of the city.\" The local control tower took note of the presence of the object at 19:30 hrs. (7:30 p.m.). The oper- ators said that they had no reports of any air- craft in flight at that time. Citizens of the town of Mazaya, located be- tween Managua and Granada, thirty kilometers from here, also said that they had seen the ob- ject. \"It was going toward the Pacific,\" said a resident. Other persons from the three towns agreed that the object was flying silently at an altitude of about\"three hundred meters, -but on account of the luminoisity few of them were able to observe its shape. \"Its velocity was slow,\" said the colonel. 16"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Argentine crew reports UFO Date of actual sighting: April 2, 1974 Location: Marcos Juarez and Central Argentina Newspaper: La Nueva Provincia, April 3, 1974 Submitted by Joe Brill Translated by Bill Armstrong Buenos Aires, 2 (Telam)-—\"After today, I will never again laugh at those who have claimed to have seen a .flying saucer.\" This statement was constantly repeated this morning in the metro- politan airport by the crew members and passen- gers of an aircraft of the airline Austral, which while in the vicinity of Marcos Juarez .crossed paths with a UFO. The object was.flying at an altitude of .22,000 meters, from north to south and also was seen by the crew of the Argentine Airlines aircraft and the control tower operators of Pajas Blancas, in Gordoba (Province). Jacinto Amuedo and Franklin Escudero, captain and co-pilot respectively of .the Austral air- craft, stated that the object \"did not resemble any known type of airplane or balloon.\" \"It was round and somwwhat flat and extremely brilliant,\" they added. The UFO was sighted at 09:30 hrs. when the commercial airplane was returning from Cordoba with seventy passengers on flight 401, at an altitude of 8,000 meters. Amuedo and Escudero commented that at 08:60 hours, when they were heading toward Cordoba, they heard by radio the pilot of flight 806 of Argentine Airlines reporting to the control tower of the existance of a flying apparatus which was described as, \"not a plane, nor a balloon nor anything known\" and requesting the assistance of the nearest radar in an-attempt to.detect it. On landing at that province (that is , at Cordoba), they found that the control tower operators were \"somewhat out of control.\" They also had seen the strange and mysterious object. Later the crew members of the Austral aircraft had the unusual opportunity of personally seeing the flying saucer when they were in mid flight returning to Buenos Aires and when they .still were discussing the case, which up to that point they knew only indirectly. The news ran like a lightning bolt among the passengers, who crowded against the little win- dows of the right side of the airplane to watch the spectacle. When they arrived at 10:05 hrs. at the metropolitan airport the people who were in the station area crowded them to hear the con- versation of the \"UFO of Marcos Juarez.\" The hostesses (Liliana Espinosa, Graciela Patterson, Susana Valaitis) and the stewardess (Alicia Fon- aneia) only managed .to say that \"it was some- hing impressive/ it was very impressive.\" At the radar station it was reported that they ould not detect the UFO owing to.the great dis- ance.   •• : - - -. • Bolivian pilot chases object which looks like a top Date of actual sighting: Nov. 8, 1973 Location: La Paz, Bolivia Newspaper: La Nueva Provinica, Nov. 10, 1973 Submitted by: Joe Brill Translated by: Bill Armstrong La Paz, Nov. 9—(Associated Press)--A strange flying object in the form of a top and with small openings similar.to little windows was sighted in this city and .fruitlessly pursued by an expert military pilot. The object was seen by hundreds of persons and its presence was verified by the control tower of the international airport \"El Alto,\" whose, radio operators tried in vain to obtain identification of the same or to communicate with its presumed crew members. The . event occurred on Thursday afternoon but, up to today was still the subject of the most varied conjectures among those who were able to .observe it. The strange. UFO was located initially at some 12,000 meters altitude over the snow capped moun- tain \"Illiman\" which overlooks this city. It was first seen by the crew of an aircraft of the Lloyd Bolivian Airlines which was coming from Lima on a regular flight. The presence of the strange and luminous object was communicated to the commander of the Air Force pursuit group of that city, Major Norberto Salomon, who at that moment was making a practice flight. The com- mander then pointed his \"Super Sabre\" which he was piloting in the direction of the UFO. The aircraft developed a speed, the pilot said, of 1500 kilometers per hour (About 930 miles an hour). Major Salomon said that he had been able to approach up to some 2000 meters of the strange object which, up to that instant, was remaining - stationary. The strange object, he related afterward, had the form of a top on whose sides, one could make out openings which resembled little windows. \"When I had managed to approach up to that distance,\" he added, \"it began to slip away at an incredible speed,\" according to the aviator. Major Salomon related that he tried to pursue the object, but that the latter in a rapid maneuver 'positioned itself swiftly in the same place where he had been only moments, before. Then it climbed (or ascended) in a vertical movement and became . lost in a few seconds from sight of Major Salomon. . 'It was hoped (or expected) today that the Air Force might release some report concerning this latest event. A cause of unrest and of a great number of questions without answers. However, for many neighbors of \"El Alto\" the event did not cause any major surprise. \"Every night,\" said a neighbor, \"We see something similar.\" 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"In Others' Words By Lucius Parish NATIONAL ENQUIRER continues to head the list of weekly tabloids containing reliable UFO in- formation. The Aug. 18 issue told of UFOs over Oklahoma during last year's flap; the Aug. 25 issue featured Dr. Berthold Schwarz's comments on the reality of UFOs; and the Sept. 1 issue con- tained two UFO articles--one dealing with a N.C. sighting and the other being actress Sheila Mac- Rae's account of her two UFO sightings. In ad- dition, recent issues of the ENQUIRER have re- peated the excerpts from Erich von Daniken's CHARIOTS OF THE GODS? which were first published a few years ago. The Aug. 18 issue of NATIONAL TATTLER carried the report of a UFO/ occupant sighting by a Springfield, Ohio, resident. The July 20 and 27 issues of NATIONAL STAR contained . interesting summaries of the current UFO situ- ation, devoting considerable space to the opin- ions and research of Dr. Hynek. I might mention that I am not attempting to cover all the tabloid articles on UFOs, as it is very difficult to pick up any of these weekly papers without finding something pertaining to UFOs. Most of it is either re-hash or fiction, so I don't feel it is even worth mentioning. An excellent example of what I'm talking about can be found in the Aug. 18 issue of NATIONAL NEWS EXTRA. One of the better articles dealing with Erich von Daniken's theories can be found in the July issue of the EAST-WEST JOURNAL. It is written by Peter Tompkins and is well worth reading. The Sept. issue of SAGA features an article on the Florida \"mystery sphere\" which was the sub- ject of so much attention recently. Although various researchers have \"identified\" the object as a valve used in paper mill operations, the author of the SAGA article does not seem to be convinced. The opinions of Star Trek's William Shatner on UFOs are detailed in the Fall issue of PROBE THE UNKNOWN. This issue also contains an article with an \"ancient astronauts\" tie-in, plus a \"Ber- muda Triangle\" report. Recent paperbacks include: SOME TRUST IN CHARIOTS edited by Castle § Thiering (Popular Library) - EXTRATERRESTRIAL VISITATIONS FROM PRE- HISTORIC TIMES TO THE PRESENT by Jacques Bergier (New American Library) - THE GOLD OF THE GODS by Erich von Daniken (Bantam) - IS ANYONE OUT THERE? by Stoneley § Lawton (Warner Paperback Library) - LEGACY OF THE GODS by Robert Charroux (Berkley) - THE HOME| OF THE GODS by Andrew Tomas (Berkley) - THE HOLLOW EARTH by Raymond Bernard (Dell). De- tailed reviews of some of these titles will ap- pear in later columns. An intriguing booklet of some 23 pages, with the title, A REVISED COSMOLOGY, has recently come to my attention. My lack of training in physics prevents me from giving this dissertation the sort of review which it deserves, but I can say that it makes for very interesting reading. Ba- sically, it concerns the author's theory of \"in- stantaneous gravitation,\" the need to revise our present cosmological concepts and the application of his theory to UFO maneuvers. The price of the booklet is $3.00. It may be ordered from the author, Merrill B. Taylor, at 1309 Broadway - Little Rock, AR. 72202. Robert Charroux's FORGOTTEN WORLDS is a typ- ical conglomerate of material relating to space i visitors in antiquity, lost civilizations and all the other topics now so familiar to readers of books on \"ancient astronauts.\" Only two chapters i of the book are devoted to UFOs, per se, although i the theme of extraterrestrials is found through- out the book. As I am somewhat of a \"literary; masochist,\" I always try to read everything of this sort which I can find, no matter how much re-hash it contains. If you feel the same way, try the Charroux book. The hardcover edition isi available from Walker § Co. - 720 Fifth Ave. - N.Y., N.Y. 10019 for $12.50. A paperback edition from Popular Library sells for $1.25. What is the life of a UFO researcher like?! The interesting story of one \"UFO chaser\" may be found in Raymond E. Fowler's recent book, UFOs-- INTERPLANETARY VISITORS. Having been privileged I to read some of Fowler's detailed UFO reports, II can say that his investigations serve as models of thoroughness. Dr. J. Allen Hynek, in a Fore- word to the Fowler book, states that he knows noi UFO investigator who is \"more dedicated, trust- worthy or persevering than Ray Fowler.\" That is high praise indeed. The book is filled with UFO reports which have been personally investigated by the author and his associates. UFO photo- graphs are included, as well as drawings of UFOs and other illustrations. Fowler speculates on the meaning of UFO visitations and updates the book to include a section on the flap of 1973. Fon a highly readable account of one man's adventures in UFO research, I can certainly recommend UFOs-- INTERPLANETARY VISITORS.

Paul Brian Jackson, 1 Heemskirk Street, Bel- lerive, Tasmania Post 7018, Australia, has been named Research Associate for Australia. Directly related to Joe's international re- sponsiblities is the expanding group of trans- lators available to translate UFO reports into English for MUFON. For example, outstanding re- ports translated from Spanish by Willard P. Arm- strong of St. Louis, Mo., have and are continuing to appear in SKYLOOK. Two gentlemen, long active in UFO circles in Japan and now residing in the U.S.A., have volunteered their services as Jap-, anese translators. They are Tomooki Watanabe, 731 18th Street, Denver, Colorado 80202, one of the founders of CBA International in Japan, arid Gunzo Tanaka, 766 Holly Street, Denver, Colorado 80220, telephone AC 303 321-2506. There has been a certain amount of confusion :-oncerning the cost of SKYLOOK for MUFON members, is well as the method of subscribing to it. Some Members have assumed that SKYLOOK was a part of 1UFON dues, since SKYLOOK is MUFON's Official 'ublication, although the $2.00 per year dues for 1UFON should suggest that this would not be pos- sible. Since our present system of asking members to subscribe to SKYLOOK separately has proven to be somewhat inefficient and confusing, we are making plans to automatically include a subscription to SKYLOOK with the annual MUFON membership. Thus the one-year dues (including both the MUFON mem- bership and the SKYLOOK subscription) would be payable at the time an individual joins MUFON, and on each subsequent anniversary date. Since the SKYLOOK subscription would expire at the same time as the membership dues, members would have a very effective reminder to renew both (we have found that SKYLOOK subscribers are very cognizant of when their subscriptions expire). As we make this . change in procedure, we must also consider a more realistic MUFON dues struc- ture. As the responsibilities and services of MUFON continue to grow, it becomes obvious that our current two-dollar annual dues are inade- quate. Very few members realize, for example, that the MUFON administrative office is operated entirely be volunteers. In order to keep abreast of the deluge of mail, and in order to maintain records properly, a part-time secretary must soon be employed. Additional funds are also needed to finance MUFON 1 s expanding role in researching and investigating the UFO phenomena. Moreover, there is increasing pressure on MUFON to expand its educational activities. SKYLOOK, too, has been operating on a budget which is just too small to ensure the continua- tion and expansion of a quality publication which will serve the needs of MUFON and the general public (see the Editor's Column on page 2). Further information concerning the proposed combination dues structure will appear in the October SKYLOOK after consultation with the MUFON Board of Directors is completed. Walt Andrus to speak in California Oct. 26 MUFON Director Walt Andrus will be the fea- tured speaker at two UFO programs in Sacramento, Calif., Oct. 26. The first program, slated for 3 p.m., is for students. The second program, open to the general public, has been set for 8 p. m. Both presentations will be at the California Exposition Fairgrounds. The programs are being sponsored by the Sac- ramento Lions Club as a special fund-raising pro- ject. The tentative admission charge is $1.00 for students for the afternoon program, and $2.50 for the general public for the evening program. The presentations will cover the most out- standing UFO sightings reported in recent years, such as the Delphos, Kansas, landing; the Pasca- goula case; and the Lawrence Coyne helicopter case. Andrus will illustrate the program . with slides from the MUFON collection. Paul J. Kelley, MUFON State Director for Sac- ramento County, is in charge of the program. 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Recapping and commenting By Richard Hall The Director's Message in July 1974 Skylook, discussing the. Akron symposium, was strongly en- dorsed by the Washington, D.C., area contingent that attended. All were impressed by the sub- stance and serious tone of the talks and meet- ings. A post-symposium back-yard luncheon meet- ing was held for D.C. area members July 20 to discuss MUFON and UFOs. Guests included Ted Bloecher, Larry Bryant, Paul and Ron Willis, John Carlson (astronomy consultant), and several can- didate and present MUFON members. Also in the July issue...Ted Bloecher's report on the 1946 sighting demonstrates not only that retrospective case investigations are possible, but also that they are valuable and important (a message that fell on deaf ears at the Colorado UFO Project). In fact, a MUFON committee or task force on UFO history, to document and flesh in early UFO history particularly, might be a good idea. Ernest Berger's Austrian sightings included a \"full moon\" and secondary \"moon\" case which he doubts could have been \"moondog\" (paraselene) phenomena. (\"Sundogs\"--or parhelion—have also been implicated in UFO cases). Technically, \"moondogs\" themselves appear only to the left or right of the moon at distances of about 22 and 45 degrees (which would not fit the present case). But the full range of luminous phenomena that can be associated with \"moondogs\" or \"sundogs,\" as I understand it, are not confined to these posi- tions. Both are caused by light reflection and contrary to the report, visible clouds need not be present. While at NICAP I once saw a well-de- veloped multiple parhelia (\"sundogs\") over Wash- ington, complete with luminous arcs in addition to the spots. Startling and impressive, but hard- ly UFO-like. (See \"halo\" in any good encycloped- ia) . The ad for Villa, Fry, Allingham, and Adamski photographs with no disclaimer by MUFON made me wonder what impression that would leave with readers fimiliar with the histories of these gentlemen (?). If we must be so \"democratic\" as to accept such ads, shouldn't we at least state that some investigators consider them to be ex- tremely dubious? At NICAP we investigated 3 of the 4 in some detail, and found ample reason to be highly skeptical. The same applies to Jerome Eden and Reichian \"orgone\" theory ads in past issues. The image in my mind of Carl Sagan_.on the Dick Cavett show and at Goddard Space Flight Center, Maryland, sneering and joking about UFOs con- trasts sharply with the creative and constructive research by Marjorie Fish on the Betty Hill star map. It is ironic that she is doing his work for him, whereas in the long run Sagan, if he sits the fence carefully, will come out as an astron- omer who skeptically—but actively—studied UFOs. That UFO history task force might well have a sub-group to document the activities, logic, rea- son, and argumentation of scientists as applied to UFOs. NBC UFO special set for Dec. 15 The NBC News one-hour documentary film depict- ing what is being done to resolve the UFO phenom- enon is presently scheduled for Sunday, Dec. 15, at 9 p.m. Central time (10 p.m. Eastern time).The film will not only explain what the three major UFO organizations in the United States are doing to seek the answers to this phenomenon, but will take viewers to the scenes of several outstanding UFO sightings to meet the participants and share their views. On July 19, the six-man film crew flew to Quincy to record on film the work being performed by the Mutual UFO. Network under the guidance of its Director, Walter H. Andrus, Jr. After four hours of detailed filming, with many \"re-takes,\" writer-producer Craig Leake obtained the sequen- ces and effects desired to tell the MUFON story. Besides the interview held in the Andrus home, the NBC crew journeyed to Carlyle, IL., to cover the annual MUFON picnic and include it in the film. The news team also spent two days at Akron, OH., .June 22 and 23, filming MUFON's Annual UFO Symposium, where nationally-known speakers pre- sented papers. The NBC Documentary has been over four months in the making, with eight weeks of editing fol- lowing the filming. The crew had 70,000 feet of film to cut to 2,200 feet for the 51 actual min- utes of documentary! The film's budget is $190,000!!! The news team traveled throughout the United States gathering information for their film. Stops were made at Evanston, IL., to talk with the Director of the Center for UFO Studies in Northfield, IL., Dr. J. Allen Hynek of North- western University; at Pascagoula, MS.; at Tuc- son, AZ., to study the activities of APRO; and at Kensington, MD., to view the work of NICAP. The documentary is presently scheduled to fol- low a \"Bob Hope Special\" which NBC considers their very best exposure time.
