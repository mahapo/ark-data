Radio waves carrying conversations of the \"peoples\" of other planets might be passing through this newspaper page you are reading. Their detection and translation into our language is a possibility which astronomers will explore during 1973 to 19#3 and beyond. This is no figment of a flight of fancy. It is a statement of the kind of research in exobilogy, life beyo'nd tne earth, which new American astronomy has set up as one of its goals. In an epoch-making publication of the Astronomy Survey Committee of the National Academy of °ciences, entitled \"Astronomy and Astrophy- sics for the Seventies, \"one reads: At this very instant, through this very page, radio waves are pass- ing. Some may bear conversations that we could record, if we pointed a radio telescope in the right direction and tuned to the right fre- quency.\" Commenting on this, the great astronomer Dr. Jesse Greenstein of the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, says: \"Our civilization may soon take one of the greatest steps in its evolution. It may dis- cover the existence, nature and activities of independent civilizations in space.\" How can the talk of the \"civilizations\" of other worlds be detected and interpreted for human understanding? Surprising as it might be to most of the nonscientists, \"we have the mathematical theory and technology to do it,\" according to Green- stein. Radio telescopes, mathetical analysis, aided by high speed computers will be required and they are all available and to be de- veloped and refined. At least five other goals of the science of the sky in the coming decade are these: cosmology, quasars and exploding galaxies, the sun, evolution of the stars, the evolution of molecules, planets and life. Taxpayers, through tne federal government, will be supporting and viceriously participating, in the solution of the riddles of the uni- verse which have appeared during the last 10 years. Instead of being conservative, practically unchanging, the universe has turned out to be full of \"cosmic violence.\" All this violence, exemplified by the explosion of entire galaxies, each of which consisting of billions of suns, seems to conform to the incredible principles of Prof. Albert Mnstein's general relativity theory, published in 1915- How impressive is the fact that a great mathematical scientist's thoughts regarding the ways of nature are now guiding observations and interpretations of the farthest reaches of the universe! Einstein T s brain work and American technology unite to solve the riddles of the stormy universe. The kind of new giant telescopes required is illustrated by the planned array of radio telescopes, which will collect as much radio waves information as would a single radio telescope of 26 miles diameter. Editor's Note: i his acknowledgment of civilizations of other worlds makes the Condon Report look pretty silly, doesn T t it?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"UFO Landing in Proximity of Holloman Air Force Base Told Paul C. Cerny, an electronics engineer, who heads a UFO investiga- tive group in the San Fr&ncisco Bay area and who is MUFON Director for northern .California, has learned of UFO sightings in the Holloman Air Force Base, White Sands Proving Ground, New Mexico, which have been unpublished until recently. One was reported in the March issue of SKYLOOK, and we now have a landing report from two informants, who insisted upon anonymity, but who are known to be credible and responsible citizens, Their report is supported by eight other persons which include two U. S. Air Force sergeants and two Colonels. Employees of Holloman Air Force Base were driving to work on U. S. Route 70 eerly one September morning in 1956 when they came upon a disc type, domed UFO landed along side the highway approximately 12 miles west of the Base.  t-wnJU The closest eyewitnesses were within 25 -yfears of the UFO which remained on the ground for 10 to 15 minutes. There appeared to be a strong electromagnetic force field as the radios and ignition systems of automobiles close to the object ceased to function. This caused the morning commuter traffic to back up for some dis- tance. Those in the rear were not aware at the time of the cause of the stopped traffic. Eyewitnesses reported there was a whirring sound associated with the landing and takeoff of the object. The incident becsme the \"talk of the day\" and many people talked freely about it; however, after the Pentagon hed been informed of the landing, Air Force and Centre! intelligence agents arrived and employees were assembled, questioned, and sworm to absolute silence. It was learned the report sent to the Pentagon stated \"The UFO was definitely not any type of aircraft under development by the United States\" and its origin was unknown. This was not the case reported by Frank Edwards in his book \"Fly- ing Saucers-Serious Business\" and this report came to light with the informants hearing of the Ldwards report and learning it was not the same sighting they had witnessed. Mr. Cerny has another report from an engineer from a radar instal- lation on top of a low mountain celled Twin Buttes. There were twelve engineers and technicians at the installation when a UFO approached in the summer of 19&2 and began circling around the site. This was in broad daylight and the object was described as a double-sided disc \"like two bowls put together\" and it was a silvery color. No windows could be seen altho the object came within a few hundred feet of the installation. J-t appeared to be about 50 feet in diameter. One engineer grabbed his 35 mm movie camera and shot 90 feet of color film. Two days later the Air Force confiscated the film. Mr. Cerny believes this is buried somewhere in government files. These reports were made to Robert B. Klinn and David Branch and a lengthy article appeared in the Nov. 23, 1972 issue of \"The Register,\" Santa Ana, Calif. This newspaper continues to run articles on UFOs, and we thank Prof. Chas. Kahlert for sending us the clippings. lour editor had a letter from Mr. Cerny, dated March 12, and he tells us he has some new UFO reports which he will be sending us as soon as he can find the time to complete the work on them. Two that he mentioned sound very exciting, and we hope to have them for you in the next issue of SKYLOOK. Can do, Mr. Cerny?"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Ex-USAF Sergeant Tells of Vietnam Sighting Through a tip from Stanton T. Friedman (one of the main speakers at the upcoming MUFON symposium in June) writers Robert B. Klinn and David Branch obtained an interview with a.former Air Force servant and learned of a UFO sighting in Saigon, South Vietnam, early in 1967. The sergeant, who requested anonymity, was working with six others in unloading film from FR-4C T s at Tan Son Nhut Air Base. About one a.m. they saw the object as they wer e waiting for the \"birds\" to come back from a mission, \"I couldn't tell at first what it was,\" the sergeant said. \"But it was coming in. It was coming from my right. Thet would be, I would guess, from the east going west. And going down the runway from the nearest end, from Saigon, towards the end of Tan Son Nhut. It came in* When I saw it, was flying, st most, about 50 to 70 feet above the ground. \"And my first impression was thst somebody was shooting a practice landing, a touch and go. But at Tan Son Nhut they didn't shoot touch and goes, because it was the busiest airport in the world. So it dawned on me, 'He's either going to crash land or he's going to by- pass. 1 1 thought that because at first I thought it was a plane. There's almost always 'birds' circling overhead. \"And there w t re always flares in the air. And the object came in, but didn't touch down, whatever it was. It came up under a flare, and I could see that it was a disc shape, i could see the reflection off of it from the flare. I couldn't see a whole lot under the bottom or anything. And there were just orange and green-colored lights around the outside of it.\" Asked if he could see a dome, the sergeant replied, \"All I remember was thst it was a disc. I would ^u ess that it wss between 30 and 40 feet in diameter. -Chat's a rough estimate. And it went down the full length of the runway, /.nd it went over f no-rnan's land,' that's where the Viet Cong sometimes shoot up at airplanes taking off. It seemed to pause there for £ second, and then it shot straight up.\" He said the object appeared to accelerate at incredible speed, then all of a sudden \"it shot up and became a dot, the same size as a star. And we watched it go across and move between tr.e st?rs, and then it disappeared.\" He estimated it w?s in view for about 10 minutes. He called the Control Tower which verified spotting the UFO and assumed the Tower turned in a report. 'i\"he sergeant was never contacted by anyone about the sighting. The sergeant also told of radar-scope photos taken of UFOs. When he was stationed at Columbus Air Force Base, near Columbus, Miss., in 1965-66, he helped down load cans of film. When the planes would land, the crew would sometimes say that they had radar-scope photos taken of UFO S .The films were stamped \"UFO n and then \"3ECKLT\" snd were sent to a lab for processing. The sergeant saw one of the films after it was processed. \"It showed blips,\" he said. \"The track of one of the objects showed that the object had made a 90-degree turn.\" He added that he learned most of the UFOs seen could not be cali- brated because of their acceleration. \"They have a range knob on a radar set to Calibrate speed,\" he explained. \"And if the range is zeroed in on, ssy 5 miles, if an object went across the scope in a blur, you couldn't calibrate it. They would have to flip the switch to maximum range.\" He said he didn't know what became of the UFO films, but had been told they were sent under classification to V;ashin^ton, b. C.

St. Louis Globe-Democrat, March 6,1973 - A shy but friendly uniden- tified flying object thst follows automobiles has been spotted by at least a dozen residents of Piedmont, Mo. They call the UFO shy because it only appears on dark nights and zooms away before anyone can get close to it. They consider it friendly because it brightly illuminates the highway in front of cars moving down Route 49. The first sighting near the town of 2,000 about 135 miles south of St. Louis was made on the night of Feb. 21 by Reg Bone, coach of Clearwater High School, two assistant Piedmont team managers and three players re- turning home from a basketball tournement st Essex, Bone said. Bone said he was driving the school's driver education car along U. S, 60 near Elsinore when he and the five boys saw a bright shaft of light beaming down out of the sky. As the car pulled onto Route 49 near Brushy^reek, one of the boys, Han- dal Holmes, said he yelled out, \"There's that thing we saw back on High- way 60. # Bone ssid he stopped the car on the shoulder of the highway and he and the boys got out to get a better look at the bright but silent fly- ing object. \"It looked like it was about 50 feet off the ground and maybe about 200 yards away--it was impossible to determine the size or shape be- cause of the darkness. \"Anyway,\" Bone said,\"we all saw four lights — like maybe coming from portholes—red, green, ember and white. We figured they were about three or four feet apart, all in a row.\" Gary Barks, who is listed in the Who Is Who of American High School Students because of his academic excellence, said, \"We stood there and watched it for five to 10 minutes. \"Then it went directly up in the sir with absolutely no noise and just disappeared over a hill.\" Word spread quickly around Piedmont and the next night, Mrs. Kathy Keith, her brother, Roy Burch Jr., and his wife were driving near the Brushy Creek area when, they s?id, they spotted the object blinking in white, green, amber and red. \"Red seemed to predominate,\" Mrs. Keith said, adding, \"All of a sudden it started bouncing around, and the lights started blinking again.\" As the object began moving along the highway, Burch said, he attempt- ed to catch up with it in his car. \"Roy started speeding up to get, close to it. He was doing about 70 but we lost it,\"Krs. Keith said, \"he got to the Brushy Creek area and there were some other Piedmont people there—Bob Smith and Mr. and Mrs. Almon Coleman—standing on the road looking at the thing hovering over the field. \"One of the men had a pair of binoculars but it was so dark he couldn't figure out what it was. It stayed at the seme height for about 10 min- utes,\" Mrs. Keith ssid, then disappeared over a hill. And others say there is something strange going on near the water of drushy Creek.

Jan. 26, 1973: - You might not believe this, end officially they don't exist, but. . . A Cherokee County youth, who for obvious reasons asked not to be identified, said he was traveling south on S. C. Highway 1# about 13. miles south of Gaffney about 11:25 p. m. Friday, January 19, when his attention was attracted to a number of various colored lights flashing on and off in the highway directly ahead of his car. Thinking there had been a wreck and that the lights were signals from wreckers and patrol cars, the youth began slowing his vehicle. However, when he got closer to the scene he was shocked to see that there was no wreck, but that the flashing lights he observed were originating from a domed, saucer-shaped object sitting in the middle of the road and surrounded by about a dozen men. The youth, who for a moment doubted his sanity and who admittedly was very frightened by what he saw, turned his car to the left onto a secon- dary road near the object and quickly fled. In an interview the following Monday night, January 22, the youth said the object, which was supported by three legs or struts and which occupied sbout three-fourths of the highway, glowed a dark yellow similar to the glow of a light bulb. Extending from the bottom portion of the object was a set of steps or a ladder. Around the object were about a dozen men, each wearing an outfit re- sembling white coveralls on which were various buttons, buckles and belts. The men were of average height and had faces the color of Caucasians: each of them appeared to have \"jet black\" hair. On their hands were what ap- peared to be white gloves. The witness didn't remember observing their feet. The men did nothing but stand in their position near the object. Those who were facing in another direction awsy from the witness, slowly turned their heads and looked at the approaching car but showed no particular interest in it. An unusual fact about the men, one which the witness was reluctant to mention, was that they appeared to waver, much as an object appears to do when viewed through the heat radiating from a heater. As the youth said, \"They sort of wiggled like a worm.\" The object itself hed a curved botton \"like a plate,\" and a curved or angled upper section capped by a dome. The dome, the witness said, was the most prominent characteristic of the object because of its large size. The position below tne dome was thinner as measured from the curved bottom to the base of the dome, 'i he flashing lights, which had been the prelude to the experience, were arranged in a band around the base of the dome. The lights were \"all colors--green, blue, red, white\" and didn't appear to be arranged in any particular order. There were no windows or other openings in the object other than in the area where the steps were located. However, that section of the ob- ject was turned away from the witness and could not be observed closely. It appeared as though the steps were made into a door, one end of which had dropped from the curved bottom of the object. The witness said there would not have been enough space for his car to pass under the object and that the men could not have stood beneath it without scooping. He also said a car could not have passed the object on the highway and noted that he had met no other vehicles prior to ob- serving the object. He estimated that the object covered sbout three-fourths of the width of the highway, which would place its diameter at 15 feet at least, since the highway pavement in the area measures about 22 feet in width, accord- &"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"ing to the State Highway Department figures. The neight of the object, from its curved bottom to the top of the dome was judged to be sbout the same as its width. The object appeared to be constructed of a material resembling fiber glass. A later visit to the alleged landing site revealed no physical evidence that the reported event actually occurred. However, the youth's story is supported by statements from several other persons who reportedly saw unusual, flying lights in the same area during the same week. One woman said th?t a light followed her car for a considerable distance down High- way 13 late Monday night, January 15, near the site of the alleged landing. She seid the light continued to follow the car after she turned into a secondary road leading to her home and remained close by for a period of time after she had gone into the house. At least three other persons ore said to have seen mysterious lights flying in the same area, one of them on the same night of the alleged landing. Perhaps it should be noted at this time that the youth said he does not drink and had not been smoking, marijuana nor taking other drugs. He did not believe in \"flying saucers\" prior to his experience nor was he par- ticularly interested in them. However, he is now seriously considering the possibility of their existence.

Witnesses, Fawcett said, described the \"blood-red circular\" object as 1# feet in diameter \"and/or much larger\" and givingoff smoke or exhaust on its outer edges. It revolved as it moved up into the sky from almost ground level. The UFO was seen by Mr. and Mrs. Bobby Williams, 507 Lovill Street, and Mr. and Mrs. Sam Jones, 413 South Street, ^oth made independent re- ports to Fawcett without knowing of the other's experience \"and were very much relieved to hear thst others had seen the same object at approximately the same time.\" The Jones family reported the UFO moved about a 45-degree angle above the old Kroger store on Willow Street in a northeast direction while the Williams family saw it move toward the North Main Street Dry Bridge direction. Both families were watching TV when they were distracted by a \"sudden flash of brilliant red light that lit up the inside of their homes from one end to the other,\" ^'awcett said. Williams went outside his home to investigage and sew the strange object move up into the sky.

It hovered, came down to the tree line, hovered again, then crossed the road and \"crashed\" into the woods. The couple hurried to the nearest telephone to call state police. Nothing was found in a preliminary night time search, but the next day state police from Port Norris Barracks uncovered a cleared site approximately two feet in diameter in the wooded area where the object had reportedly crashed. Police said the srea was bare of all vegetation and pine needles and in the center WoS a round hole two inches wide and four inches deep. \"It was a reel wild area and 1 don't see how anything could have gotten in here except from above,\" Trooper Leonard Anderson said.

Scientists report new evidence that indicates that Titan, the larg- est of the 10 moons of Saturn, may have atmospheric conditions similar to those that existed on the earth at the dawn of life. A study of Titan has been conducted by Dr. Carl Sagan, professor of astronomy and director of Cornell's Laboratory for Planetary Studies. The research has been supported by the National Science Foundation and the N/ational Aeronautics and Space Administration. The findings have intrigued officials of NASA and they plan to loft two unmanned space- craft which would fly by Jupiter in 1977 and out past Saturn in 1931. Their trajectories would take them within 100 miles of Titan. If the space shot does not go off in 1977, it will be another 20 years before Saturn and Jupiter will be so aligned in their respective orbits on the sun to make possible exploration by a single spacecraft.

Erich Von Daniken on Today Show Erich Von Deniken, author of \"Chariots of the Gods?\" and \"Gods From Out Space, n appeared briefly on the TODAY show on TV recently and, in our opinion, was not given a fair shake. After admitting the network had received thousands of letters following the showing of the TV special \"In Search of Ancient Astronauts,\" Frank McGee used most of the time to express his own skepticism of the theories advanced by Von Daniken in- stead of allowing the author to speak for himself. Mrs. Eric Bluhm sends us an article by Allen Spraggett in the Seattle \"Post-Intelligencer\" in which Von Daniken told Spraggett of a discovery in an underground cave near Quito in Ecuador. The cave, according to Dr. Juan Moricz, its discoverer, contains thousands of folios with pages of light metal, some of pure gold. Stamped into these pages are messages in some strange language. It contains 56 characters or letters and re- sembles no launguage known. Von Daniken thinks the folios comprise a vast library left behind as a sort of time capsule by ancient space visitors and may reveal who the space beings were and where they ceme from. And whoever left the library must have left the key to decipher contents, Von Daniken says. He hasn't seen the folios himself, but has photographs of some of the plates, and has Moricz's promise to take him to the csve. 12"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"UFOs Behind the Iron Curtain - Research by Joseph M.

Reliable witnesses were observing a strange object in the dir- ection of the new tower-house (skyscraper( in the city of Pribram for fifty- five minutes. The object did not appear to move for a very long time. At first the light of this object was a horizontal light and it changed to a higher altitude when it was last seen by the observers. The object was emitting a very bright light which could be seen very clearly and in the course of observation the object was shifting slowly westward toward the village of Zdabor during the almost hour it was being watched. From 10:00 p. m. to 10:55 P- m. the observers were convinced thtt, the object wcs not giving out any sound, neither wrs it a helicopter nor 1 any usual celestial body. This object was really very strange, indeed, such as one that has never seen seen by the eye-witnesses before. Since there is so much news in the world press again about the Flying Saucers, the witnesses carne to our editorial room to tell us about this particular appearance that they had observed over Pribram.

A few months back a train was derailed . . . month before last, a pickup truck loaded wit! old auto tires traveling a short distance in front of me went out of con- trol and off into the ditch.

I spoke with a local resi- dent at a Decatur service station where I stop regularly for gas. I in- formed him of my observations and asked if I should inform someone locally so that they might investigate it further.

It was just after midnight and a heavy rain was falling. The object seemed to get caught in some trees and then go out. Apparently frightened , Perry went on home. The next day he returned to the site to investigate and found a heap of burned metal and wire on the ground beneath the trees. \"It was lying in a heap about two feet in diameter and.six to nine inches high. There was a nest of very fine wire surrounded by paper- thin strips of something like aluminum metal about two inches wide,\" he said. An estate employee, who removed some of the metal, experienced a tingling sensation in his fingers which continued for several days. Both men said police were informed and took away pieces of the object, but this was denied by the Themes Valley Police who said they nothing about it, when questioned by a reporter from the \"Beds & Bucks Observer,\" which carried the story Jan. lo, 1973- When questioned, a spokesman at the Ministry of Defence for Air said the finding did not fit in with any known pattern.

Huge UFO Seen in Africa A massive unidentified flying object, 30 m in diameter, with port- holes as big as door, was seen near Queenstown by East Londoners, Mr, and Mrs. W.

At 12:30 a.m. on Monday they had passed through Queenstown, nearing Penhoek Pass, when they saw what they took to be a long train curving towards the road. Mr. Sucknow remarked he had noticed no level crossing sign. Then suddenly theyrealized the object was six to eight metres atove the ground. It was moving slowly and silently towards Dordrecht. After hovering above the road it picked up speed, but when about 90m from the road, slowed down again. \"It glowed with an orange light end was emitting orange smoke. I couldn't see the top because of the dark, but it was much bigger than a Boeing,\" Mr. Sucknow told the East London \"Daily Reporter\" which published a report of the sighting on Jan. 17, 1973. \"The inside of the car became icy cold.

The event occurred the October 2#th, 1971, at Saine-Therese, Quebec, some few miles north of the city of Montreal. The principal witness, Miss Johane Warren, living at Saine-Therese, was waiting\"for the bus around 5:50 P.M. She took the bus. going in the direction of the north, on the Saine-Rose Boulevard. Suddenly, as she looked outside the bus, she noticed that a long and brilliant object, in the shape of that of a cig- arette, was following the bus, up in the air, and the luminous appearance of this object was like that of pale gold, and most of the time, whitish and brilliant. The object was following the bus in a parallel way and its altitude, even if it was difficult to estimate clearly, was apparently very high. When Miss Warren arrived at destination and went out of the bus, the object was still there, but seemed to be inclined by the right side of its length, and just above an electric station of the Hydro- Quebec Company. She ran quickly inside her home to advise some other persons, and they all came back out of the house. In the total, there were six per- sons who later described the object as it has been said before. But at this moment ( it was now 6:05 P.M.), the object was inclined by its left side and was moving, very slowly. It then disappeared up in the sky after few seconds. But now, the most interesting of that, was that at around 6:15 P.M. the electric power suddenly lessened in the home of Miss Warren and this occurred twice with some 4 seconds at intervals, and suddenly all the residence area there called \"Doraaine de la Promenade\" was out of power during about 15 minutes. / Note: This incident, which appeared to be very common to most people, appeared in the local newspaper of the area, but no explanation was given for the power failure.7 At the same moment that the object at Saine-Therese, seemed to dis- appear in the sky over the Place, just on the shore facing the city of Ssinte-Therese, at Montreal-North, a lady with her son and daughter all saw a kind of \"luminous object like a cigarette-shape\" motionless in the sky, and according to the angle of the sight and of the altitude, \"it would have been possible that this object was probably over Sainte-Therese near the residence area,\" as said three Montreal witnesses later when they reported this sighting and without knowing that at Sainte-Therese there were six other witnesses who saw about the same object, at the same time.
