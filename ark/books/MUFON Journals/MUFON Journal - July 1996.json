David Spencer, Deputy Director, Investigations It was intended to produce this section in one part, but space does not allow a reasonable presentation of sum- marized data and discussion without the subject being presented as two parts. Part 1 of this section addresses the viewing conditions, the appearances of objects re- ported over the years, and multiple objects. Statistical measures are made for those types which have com- monly been seen. VIEWING CONDITIONS It is not possible to identify all the factors that might have caused misinterpretations due to conditions for viewing the objects, but most reports did give general- ized sky and weather status at the time of the sighting. Sky There were 545 reports of events before 1995 that iden- tified the sky to be either clear, partly cloudy, or over- cast. Partly cloudy or overcast skies were reported 25 percent of the time (137 reports). A greater percentage than at night happened during daylight hours (30 versus 24 percent). It was initially expected that there would be more CE type sightings than other types during cloudy weather, since the objects would be closer and presumably easier JULY 1996 NUMBER 339 PAGE 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL CHART 4-2.

Overall, the percentages of CE sightings with overcast or partly cloudy skies were the same as the non-CE (25%). One would expect more sightings with partly cloudy than with overcast skies, but, over all sighting types, they were about the same (14 percent and 11 percent, re- spectively). For the CE type sightings, the two are nearly the same (12 and 13 percent, respectively), as seen in Chart 4-1. A difference is observed for the MA and FB types, in which there are more events during partly cloudy con- ditions. This result supports the claim that these are distant objects, most of which could not be observed if the skies were overcast. Chart 4-1 shows a high percentage of AN type sight- ings during overcast or partly cloudy conditions (47 percent versus about 25 percent of any other type). This difference from the other types helps distinguish AN as a type of sighting which is composed of phenomena different from other types. (Sections 2 and 3 of this re- port also suggest oddities with the AN types.) Weather There were 581 reports of pre-1995 events that gave weather conditions as either fair, foggy, rainy, windy, or with lightning, sleet, or snow. Over 91 percent of these reports identify the weather as fair. When the percent- ages of each type of sighting are examined (Chart 4-2), the CE proportion during poor weather is greater than ei- ther MA or FB proportions, and the AN type is again different from the other types. Whereas the CE, MA, and FB types all have fewer than 8 percent of their sightings in other than fair weather, the AN type has over 25 per- cent. Comment on AN Type Sightings For both the cloudy sky and poor weather compar- isons, some of the statistical discrepancies could be a result of the small number of AN type cases (36 with sky and 40 with weather information). Statistically, if the AN types should have the same proportions as the other types, the probability of getting the results shown by the data is only 0.1 percent for cloudy skies and 0.03 percent for poor weather, which means the AN sightings are surely different. Some AN sightings may be promoted by sky and weather conditions. If PAGE 4 NUMBER 339 JULY 1996"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Table 4-1. IDENTIFIED SHAPES, IN ORDER BY QUANTITY.

For example, until recently, a sprite shooting above thunderstorm clouds would be an anomaly (not an IFO), since no one knew of sprites as part of natural science. OBJECT SHAPES Over the years, a large variety of UFO shapes have been perceived, the most common ones being the boomerang, disc, oval, sphere, star, and triangle. Since these shapes are identified in 75 percent of the reports before 1995, they are featured in this discussion. The totals of all shapes that were pre-identified in the database are given in Table 4-1. The indicated shape is not necessarily an identification that objects that are classified with the same shape are alike; the classifica- tion is a visual approximation, not an identifier. Mostly, the objects were solid, or the witness believed there was a dark, solid mass being outlined by lights. The shapes and number of objects were based on the out- lines. In some cases, the lights did not appear to be part of a physical object, even if the lights outlined one, and the number and shapes were based on the lights, not the outline. Trends Chart 4-3 illustrates the proportion of events identify- ing each shape. If the year-to-year variations consis- tently showed the same effects, and if witnesses all had the same perception of an object's shape, this JULY 1996    NUMBER 339 chart would be more significant. These averages are still suitable for pointing out a few changes that appear to be happening. Notice the significantly progressive decline in the percentage of disc shapes, from nearly 40 percent to more than 15 percent of the reports. This must be show- ing a real trend downward. Like the disc, the sphere seems to be diminishing in its proportion of events. Three other shapes (boomerang, star, and triangle) ap- pear to be trending to higher proportions of cases. With the steepest growth rate of the three, the triangle is cur- rently in about 10 percent of the reports, up from less than 6 percent during the prior period and 3 percent before that. Having a similar growth trend, the star is currently reported 15 percent of the time, up from 12 percent in the prior period. Other Shapes A few of the shapes identified as \"other\" can be de- scribed reasonably well. Several of them involve as- sortments of lights configured in an unusual shape, the collection moving as a single object. Table 4-2 illustrates several of these unique shapes. Associations with Type of Sighting, Month, Time, Location, and Sighting Conditions Proportions each of the six most observed shapes by sighting type are given in Chart 4-4. Three points are surfaced by this analysis: 1. The star shape was typically (89 percent of its sightings) seen as a distant object.

The oval was mainly (59 percent of its sightings) seen as a distant object. Further analysis shows there to be more FB type reports giving this shape than any other. 3. The boomerang was observed almost equally in close and distant sightings. For the six most frequent shapes (boomerang, disc, oval, sphere, star, and triangle), sighting durations and time of day are consistent with the findings for all sight- ings (Section 2). These shapes have been seen in all quadrants of the U.S. (defined in Section 3). No notable peculiarity is seen regarding the sighting conditions (sky and weather, from earlier in this section) in which these six principal shapes were observed. There is no record in the database of the boomerang, star, or tri- angle being seen when it was raining, but this fact is not statistically significant. Multiple Objects The database has a total of 153 cases (26 percent of the reports) in which more than one object was observed and identified. In 16, multiple shapes were seen, and in 13 of these, two or more different shapes were seen together. If it is presumed that UFOs stem from different sources, the observance of different shapes together suggests they belong to one family. Two different reports claimed a spherical object and a cylindrical one, and two reports claimed discoids and a rectangular object. Two cases involved starlike shapes with triangular shapes, and two others involved boomerang shapes with starlike shapes. Four of the re- maining five cases claimed a sphere and a \"bat wing,\" a cone and an ellipsoid, a star and an oval, and a star with a rectangle. The final case involved star shapes, a formation like a helmet, an ellipsoid, box shapes, a \"U\" shape (vertical half-ellipsoid), and fish fin, fan like shapes. For comparison purposes, the percentages of sightings for single and multiple objects are given in Table 4-3. There were over 2.5 times as many non-CE reports as CE reports of multiple objects (19.5 percent vs. 7.2 per- cent, or 112 vs. 41 cases). The high percentage of star shapes across the ranges of multiple objects is not surprising due to the fact that any lit object seen at a sufficient distance will appear to be a point of light.

As presented in Part 2 of this section, 63 percent of the star sightings were at distances greater than one mile, in- dicating the possibility of a viewed point source of light actually being something else, including more than one light. Potentially significant are three cases in which an object changed from one shape to another. In one, a single object (boomerang) broke up into 20-30 pieces and a cylinder. In another, several stars formed a shape like a sea diver's helmet which then acted as a single ob- ject. A case in 1995 involved a boomerang with a thin protrusion out the back that changed to a triangle. The changing of shape is discussed more in Section 5, con- cerning report correlations. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, SECTION 4 PART I: Viewing Conditions â€¢ The percentage of sightings during overcast skies was the same for CE and non-CE type sightings - 25 percent. â€¢ The percentage of sightings with overcast (11 percent) and partly cloudy (14 percent) skies were approxi- mately the same. â€¢ Over 91 percent of the sightings occurred during fair weather. â€¢ AN type sightings showed the following differences from other types: â€” 47 percent of the AN type sightings happened during overcast or partly cloudy skies, versus about 25 percent of the other types. â€” Over 25 percent of the AN type sightings oc- curred during poor weather conditions - versus less than 8 percent of other types. Object Shapes â€¢ The principal shapes, accounting for 75 percent of the sightings, were the boomerang, disc, oval, sphere, star, and triangle. â€¢ The proportion of reports identifying the shape to be a disc has significantly declined, from about 38 percent of the reports before 1985 to an average of 22 percent between 1985 and 1989 and 15 percent be- tween 1990 and 1994. â€¢ The triangle appeared to have the sharpest growth rate, from an average of 3 percent of the reports be- fore 1985 to 6 percent between 1985 and 1994 and 10 percent between 1990 and 1994. â€¢ The star shape was typically (89 percent of the time) seen at a distance (non-CE sighting). â€¢ The oval was more often seen at a distance (59 per- cent) than close and was represented by more FB type sightings than any other shape. â€¢ Sightings of multiple objects were claimed in 153 (26 percent) of the reports, and 13 of these claimed mul- tiple shapes seen simultaneously. â€¢ There were almost three times as many distant sight- ings of multiple objects than close sightings â€¢ Three cases involved objects that changed form while being watched. PREVIEW OF SECTION 4, PART 2: The sizes, surfaces, colors, emissions, sounds, distances, and landings of objects are covered. Part 2 also ad- dresses cases in which witnesses claimed they were be- ing followed.

What if tomorrow morning, you walked out of your door and saw an enormous spaceship hovering over your entire city? And what if you learned that the same thing was happening across your planet? These kinds of questions have sparked innumerable discus- sions, theories and debate across the planet. Now, we're about to get the answers. In the epic adventure film INDEPENDENCE DAY, strange phenomena surface around the globe. The skies ignite. Terror races through the world's major cities. As these extraordinary events unfold, it becomes in- creasingly clear that a force of incredible magnitude has arrived; its mission: total annihilation over the Fourth of July weekend. The last hope to stop the de- struction is an unlikely group of people united by fate and unimaginable circumstances. Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin, the filmmak- ers behind 1994's smash hit, \"Stargate,\" have revolu- tionized and re-defined the way big-event movies are produced through a new level of ground-breaking effects techniques and spectacular, never-before-seen images in INDEPENDENCE DAY. Emmerich serves as the film's director, executive producer (with Ute Emmerich and Bill Fay), and co-creator; Devlin is the producer/writer. The associate producer is Peter Winther. Starring are Will Smith, Bill Pullman and Jeff Goldblum. Co-stars are Mary McDonnell, Judd Hirsch, Margaret Colin, Randy Quaid, Robert Loggia, Harvey Fierstein, Brent Spiner and Vivica Fox. In creating the film Emmerick and Devlin wanted a multi-character disaster film, but with a new twist, so they used an alien invasion as a way of creating a world- wide, international disaster. The style of this movie is reminiscent of the great war and adventure movies, like \"The Longest Day,\" which had numerous characters, in- stead of one main action hero. According to Devlin, the model shoot is \"the largest ever attempted for a feature film with four cameras, working every day. We hope to extend special effects way beyond anything we've ever attempted, to really push the limits of what can and can't be done, with a mixture of high technology and old-fashion filmmaking. We're using digital composition and digital animations alongside techniques as simple as airplane models on a wire.\" I had the privilege of viewing a ten minute preview in Las Vegas, Nevada on April 17th as part of the publicity for the film by Twentieth Century Fox and the dedica- tion of the \"Extraterrestrial Highway\" to Rachel, Nevada on April 18, 1996. To disclose any more details or the A/c'ir York residents flee from an attack of incredible inagnt nidf in INDEPENDENCE DA Y. <Q 20th Century Fox story line might detract from the readers' anticipation and enjoyment of this spectacular film epic. INDE- PENDENCE DAY will be released on July 3, 1996 to theaters nationwide, where UFO aficionados will be exposed to the question â€” \"What If?\" â€” what if the Earth is invaded by an alien species? Former President Ronald Reagan posed this question publicly on at least four occasions. Now you can see for yourself. The title \"Independence Day\" not only dates the film July 4th, but has a secondary meaning tied directly in with President Reagan's implication. This sensational motion picture is a must for everyone â€” not just UFO enthusiasts, and comes highly recommended. THE UFO CONNECTION To emphasize the UFO connection in the festivities, four well-known UFO researchers were invited by the publicity department of Twentieth Century Fox to join the celebration as guests of honor and participate in a UFO question and answer panel at Rachel, NV in the dedication for the \"Extraterrestrial Highway\" by Nevada JULY 1996 NUMBER 339 PAGE 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Photo b\\ Wall Andrus. state dignitaries and Twentieth Century Fox. The pan- elists were Vicki Cooper Ecker. Don Ecker, George Knapp, Walter H. Andrus, Jr. and moderated by Michael Broidy, Senior Publicist. The guests were accommodated overnight at the fab- ulous Mirage Hotel, followed by a private reception at Planet Hollywood in Cesaer's Palace honoring Nevada's Governor, Bob Miller and wife Sandy; Lt. Governor Lonnie Hammargren and spouse: State Senators, in- cluding Jack Regan: invited press: and VIP guests. The Century Theaters Cinedome was the locale for a screen- ing of advance footage from \"Independence Day - ID4,\" where Governor Miller and Lt. Gov. Hammargren wel- comed invited guests. Following the screening. Dean Devlin answered questions from the audience. On Thursday morning, the FOX VTP coach picked up the motion picture stars, Fox dignitaries and three of the UFO panelists at the Mirage Hotel and drove us to the parking lot of the Las Vegas Convention Center, the departure site for the ET Hwy/ID4 convoy to Rachel, NV. I think even the movie stars were impressed with the luxury accommodations on the K-T Service bus, that according to our driver. Jerry Jones, cost a half million dollars to build. A convoy of ID4 enthusiasts buses from Phoenix, AZ, Los Angeles, CA, and hun- dreds of private vehicles journeyed to Rachel, NV for the ceremony renaming state highway 375, that runs from near Ash Springs (Hiko) to Warm Springs, NV via Rachel, as the \"Extraterrestrial Highway.\" This highway skirts the mountain range over which the famous \"Area 51\" test site exists near Groom Lake and the S-4 com- plex at Papoose Lake (both dried up). Upon deboarding the bus, I was met by our MU- FON Nevada State Director Alan Gudaitis, his wife Sandy (Lepore) Gudaitis, Asst. State Director, and Christine A. Sanderson, Slate Section Director for Clark County. I also briefly met one of our members from Orange County, Calif, who was on one of the Los Angeles buses. Even though the tent at Rachel was setup just south of the \"Little A'Le' Inn,\" I wasn't able to even say hello to Joe and Pat Travis, the owners and State Section Directors for Lincoln County, due to a very tight schedule of events, interviews, etc. (In fact, I didn't even have time to partake of the refreshments in the Planet Hollywood-sponsored VIP tent in which the ceremonies took place.) For the dedication ceremonies, the stage was occu- pied by Nevada government officials and Twentieth Century Fox stars, directors, writers and producers. I sat next to Sandy Miller, the governor's wife, on the front row for VIPs with our UFO dignitaries. (Yes, this Texas country boy was being overwhelmed by the VIP treat- ment, but there was more to come.) Mistress of Ceremonies, Vicki McGowen (Executive Director of the Incline Village/Crystal Bay Visitors and Convention Bureau) welcomed the audience and introduced Governor Bob Miller. (When I asked Ms. McGowen if she knew our MUFON State Section Director in Incline Village, NV she quickly confirmed that she was ac- quainted with Chuck Breese.)

Nevada Governor Bob Miller delivered the welcome speech to a battery of press video cameras and then in- troduced Lt. Governor Lonnie Hammargren (who really got into the festivities by wearing a rattlesnake skin hat and vest over his camouflaged hunting regalia, while carrying a replica of an entity in a pouch). I felt under- dressed in comparison, since my only claim to fame consisted of a special ball cap produced by Jim Greenen to inaugurate the \"Extraterrestrial Highway\" on April 18. 1996 and a bolo tie of an entity (antique silver with black onyx eyes) manufactured by Byron Butler, a mem- ber in Phoenix, AZ. Considering the number of times that press photographers asked me to pose for a photo- graph, it became obvious that they were interested in my cap, not yours truly. (Jim Greenen was selling baseball caps at Rachel, so 1 am sure that others went home later with their own.) Lt. Governor Hammergren discussed the long-term promotion of the ET highway on behalf of the Nevada Commission on Tourism (he is the chairman) and then introduced Bob Perechetti. Vice Chairman of the Commission who presented keys to the Nevada Pioneer Territory to Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerick, co- writers, of ID4. Dean explained the conception of the ID4 monument that will become a permanent fixture in Rachel and on the time capsule aspects. The cast mem- bers were introduced and individually presented their contributions to the time capsule. Governor Miller made a contribution on behalf of the State of Nevada. The unveiling of the ET highway sign was conducted by Gov. Miller, Lt. Gov., Tom Fait and Tom Stephens representing the state of Nevada. The UFO panel discussion followed the unveiling ceremonies of the ID4 monument and ET highway signs. (The Governor had a special speed limit sign that simply said \"Speed Limit Warp 7\" which he later placed in his office.) Each of the panelists made an opening statement concerning the theme of the film \"Independence Day â€” What are the possibilities and probabilities of the Great 'What if\"?

I personally had a chance to visit extensively with Jeff Goldblum (who plays David) and Robert Loggia (General Grey) and even longer visits with Dean Devlin the producer/writer of \"ID4,\" whom I found to be very friendly and delightful people. Bill Pullman (the President) joined the bus con- tingent for the trip to Rachel, but I never had an oppor- tunity to visit with him one-on-one. A special highlight and thrill for me personally, was the flight from Rachel. NV back to McCarron International Airport in Las Vegas in a Bell 206 four pas- senger helicopter.

Since I was scheduled to be on the same heli- copter, operated by Sundance Helicopters, as the Governor in order to catch my flight back to San Antonio I was obligated to cut my visit short. In addition to the pilot, who was President and owner of Sundance Helicopters, the other passengers were Ms. Kellee Jones and Tom Stephens. We were all equipped with head sets and microphones so we could not only converse with each other, but could hear all of the radio commu- nication taking place. Part of the time the Governor, who rode next to the pilot, discussed state business with Mr. Stephens as we flew along the mountain ridge that separates Area 51 and the highway. The FOX-TV net- work helicopter was just ahead of us and the \"stars\" were following our flight in another Bell 206. (There were 15 to 20 helicopters at Rachel for the ceremonies, plus six buses and an unknown number of other vehicles that reduced the field to powdered dust.) We were thank- ful that a tent had been provided for the press and the VIPs, since the blowing dust was a serious inconve- nience. As the procession of helicopters flew from Rachel to Las Vegas, the pilot switched his transmitter over to a ra- dio frequency used by Area 51 communications and called their tower operator. A female operator ac- knowledged the call, whereby our pilot advised her why there was a contingent of helicopters operating nearby and not to become concerned. After the communications had been completed, the Governor jokingly said, \"If there is nothing over there (Area 51) how could anyone answer?\" Who is the US government trying to kid? No, we didn't see anything unusual or any aircraft flying from Area 51 during our flight. With my trusted Cannon EOS Rebel, I got several photos of the mountains at close range, Little A 'Le' Inn. the Stratosphere Tower in Las Vegas that just opened, and the Mirage Hotel before v landing at McCarron. A limousine and driver were wait- ing for me at the airport, where I was whisked over to the Southwest Airlines Terminal to catch my return flight to San Antonio. Now our four UFO dignitaries know why the pub- licity costs for a new major motion picture such as \"Independence Day\" are so expensive, because Twentieth Century Fox really treated us like VIPs and we loved every minute. (A publicity video for TV ad- vertising the film is now being produced, which will ap- pear on FOX-TV Nework.

For those of you who have read Bernhard Haisch's article in the March 1996, MUFON UFO Journal â€” read it again before this summer's symposium in Greensboro. And for those who have not yet read it â€” read it a couple of times. This is a straightforward reflection of \"us\" from outside the UFO community, written by a work- ing scientist familiar with the day-to-day operations of science and what is required to be accepted by same. Unfortunately, from Haisch's point of view, we don't look so good. We need to listen, re- ally listen, to what he has to say. Then we need to take meaningful action. Probably the most important message ufology can come away from his paper with is that we need to improve our public image, and in particular improve how we are perceived by science. T he message is that, regardless of what is actually going on, if we expect to get the attention of sci- ence and the attention of level-headed opinion makers, it is evident that we need to clean up our act. That clean-up would entail a broad array of activities, from policing one's personal conversations and activi- ties, to the policing of what is put into print, and where possible, what is presented by the popular media. We can control our own personal activities, even if we can- not control, or only rarely influence, the activities of those who are in it mainly for the money. Personally, I very much enjoy the \"X-Files,\" but only as a well conceived, well presented entertainment pro- gram. On the other hand, there are programs out there that are supposedly presenting facts on the UFO that have no sensibility about truth or facts, but rather a high sensibility for creating sensationalism and making dollars â€” both on our backs. In terms of policing one's personal conversations, we all must keep in mind, at all times, that this is an ex- tremely controversial subject with very few rules and no agency or group to determine who is a valid spokesmen, and who is not. The present forum is one in which the person with the most extreme view, or the most gall, gets the most attention. In most of these cases, either ten- dency generally ends up presenting a side of the UFO business that has no basis in fact, and generally causes a set-back to the serious ufologist, rather than making any progress. Along with the idea that there is no group overseeing who is a valid spokesman, worse yet, there is no one set- ting standards on what is included in the UFO realm. Today, the popular range is from the ridiculous to the sublime, and again, the more ridiculous, or the more sub- lime, the more attention there is from the pulp press and the pop media. These purveyors of sensationalism, in turn, spread the word and make a hard problem, solv- ing the UFO phenomenon, even harder. To make it worse, unfortunately, there is a large part of the public who believes far too much of the non- sense that is presented. Some of these people, uncon- sciously or otherwise, turn around and attempt to repeat this stuff as valid UFO reports. This confounds the issue, and blurs any attempt at doing meaningful science. The only science here is for psychologists and sociologists, and not very many of them are interested because of the level of \"ridiculousness\" that comes with the territory. We know very little about UFOs, and have very little to go on. in terms of what we can unambiguously say about them. Generally speaking, we have a lot of reports, some traces of physical evidence, a few pictures, and a few good, well-investigated cases, none of it absolutely conclusive. It has taken 45 years or more to accumulate these few good points of argument. Yet there are grand- standers and ego maniacs out there more than willing to take this small bit of good information and blow it into world-shattering puffery to their own ends and nothing else. Starting with these few hard-found facts, not found by them, but found by hard working, honest investiga- tors, and with an assumed license to say virtually any- thing, these detractors make us a very silly looking group in the eyes of people who understand science, in- cluding those who would really like to become involved. JULY 1996 NUMBER 339 PAGE 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Unlike science, where all of the facts are checked out before pronouncements, and where a peer review system can insist on honest work, the UFO community is plagued with quite the opposite. There is a tendency to hide seemingly new informa- tion, waiting on prime opportunities to spring \"great new revelations\" on the world. Frankly, I do not know of any such \"Great UFO Revelation\" that ever held up in the light of day. For the untrained and the uninformed to be such a dis- tractor is one thing, but for those who have been around for a while, who know what the truth is, and what this business is all about, il is detestable. Such distractors probably know they should be very choosy about what they say, yet they rarely are, with the result that the re- mainder of us are constantly forced to correct their more outrageous public pronouncements. We are all the worse for the wear. T he problem is not all the fault of the media and those who would use us to line there pockets. We must share the blame. There should always be a clear line between what is known, and what is speculated. Ones pet theory does not a scientific proof make. And if the pet story you have is one that does not meet with known facts, though you are welcome to speculate what- ever you wish, you should probably not talk about it in uncontrolled circumstances. It is not only the media that grab and run with sensational statements and sen- sational mis-statements, but it can also be anyone within ear shot. This is especially true if you are in a position that, in and of itself, would tend to give credibility to your narrative. As has been said on both sides of the UFO fence, fantastic claims require fantastic evidence. In positions of authority, that authority alone is enough for the uninformed to take insupportable speculation as being factual, assuming it to be based on supporting evidence. For example, a MUFON state director presenting a UFO session at a state or local meeting should avoid the following: religion, politics, unsubstantiated conspira- cies, and the temptation to tell the listeners what they want to hear. In the extreme, it does us no good for'a state director to tout UFO expertise in MUFON's name, and then for that person to try to convince the audi- ence that they have regular liaisons with CIA-controlled grays at any time they want them. Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? In fact, we have heard worse. As a state di- rector that person is MUFON at that meeting, and MU- FON's reputation for that group is standing on anything that person says, scientific or not. We, as ufologists, should not be trying to convince anybody of anything. We should work with facts, and nothing else. Searching for facts, and doing our best to share those facts, defines our line of work. The facts, as they are found and accumulated, will determine what the UFO is, not wishful thinking, or idle speculation. When asked what the UFO is by any form of the media, or by anybody, as far as that goes, our answer must be that we do not know, but that we do know that there are a lot of reports, and we know what the re- ports tend to indicate. We may feel like we want to say a great deal more in these situations, for the sake of educating the general public, but we must remember that we are the informed party, and that the questioner is the uninformed party. If we say anything, as the informed party, the uninformed party is: 1) allowed to believe it, and 2), allowed to quote you. When asked what the UFO reports indicate, we should be answering in very general, broad, supportable terms, based on some years of knowledge, and some common sense. On the other hand, we should not use in- formation to build a case that agrees with personal spec- ulation. When asked if the UFO comes from outer space, we must, in some way, keep it clear that that is only one of the possible answers, and that we do not know, as a fact, where they come from. That is the truth of the matter.'Guessing publically, or having the public guess, are both bad for our cause. When asked to give one's personal viewpoint on what you think UFOs are all about, be very careful. This is the most dangerous of traps, especially if you have any hope of impressing the scientific community; which, in a sense, is one of our primary goals. We do not hear scientists making great pronouncements about any- thing, unless they already know it is so. On the other hand. I have heard many, many great pronouncements about UFOs, none of which were ever true, all of which should be greatly regretted. As pointed out by Haisch, the most valuable thing a scientist has is his hard won reputation. If your spo- ken, or written, or even implied, off hand speculations are a threat to a working scientist's reputation, he will not even bother to tell you he has even the vaguest interest in UFOs. After all you have just embarrassed him, and yourself, in trying to talk \"scientist.\" MUFON is in the same position, however: our most valuable possession is our reputation, and it must be pristine if we expect to move into the working science world. At the moment we have some open wounds, some old scars, and some loose cannons that are keeping scientists away from the door. We must begin to insist on forthrightness, honesty, and the highest of ethics. We must begin to look like we are truly scientifically bent, rather than saying it, and then destroying it with some offhand, seriously stated, but totally unfounded, story. PAGE 14 NUMBER 339 JULY 1996"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL I know that there are a lot of people out there who have their pet ideas on what UFOs are all about, and I know, too, that most of them insist on being allowed to state their opinion anytime they feel like it. But this is not the way to conduct science. Science is not made up of opinions, and opinions will not make, nor sway facts. Opinions traded among peers often leads to new insights and new understandings. Opinions stated for the purpose of showing the breadth of one's knowl- edge on the subject, or to show \"the open minded- ness\" of the speaker, seldom advance the subject or influence anybody. In terms of the subject at hand, it turns off and turns away those of the scientific com- munity. Paraphrasing Haisch, the UFO community at large so badly corners scientists by our poor represen- tation of science that they are put into a deeply defen- sive mode about the subject, without ever having examined our good to better evidence. This is our problem, not theirs. It is we who present the good evidence badly, most often by trying to bend the evidence sharply toward preconceived ideas of what the UFO is, rather than by making a good presentation and letting the evidence lead where it may. Today, even the best presentation is often lightly treated, partly because of the obvious lack of community we present to the world, and partly be- cause of the amount of confusion created by the popular media, and the check-out stand out press. U nlike science, where all of the facts are checked out before pronouncements, and where a peer review system can insist on honest work, the UFO community is plagued with quite the opposite. There is a tendency to hide seemingly new information, waiting on prime op- portunities to spring \"great new revelations\" on the world. Frankly, I do not know of any such \"Great UFO Revelation\" that ever held up in the light of day. In the UFO business there is a tendency to be the first to get the news out, to grab the glory, regardless of the facts, and regardless of where the information came from, or, in some cases, whether or not it even makes common sense, or fits any known pattern in the field. On the part of some there is a tendency to hide behind government security, even when it is the point of the ar- gument. Claiming to know the deepest darkest secrets hidden under the deepest darkest security system is a cop-out for simultaneously claiming that \"there is no way you can check out my story.\" Some use this as a li- cense to say anything and then claim \"The Secret Cover- up.\" Where's the person who really does know some- thing and is willing to get arrested over it. The tendencies discussed in the last couple of para- graphs should strike a warning bell. It pays-to be the most cautious in the company of the most noisy. To close out, I wish to again invite everyone who truly has an interest in getting this subject in front of mainstream science to read and to study Bernhard Haisch's article, and then to think about where you fit in that picture and what you can do to improve it. Well discussed, well examined, wide open, verifi- able information is much closer to science than headlines from a credulous news-seeker. We want science. We want facts. We want truth. We should demand verifica- tion. We should demand reproducible results. Groundless proclamators, charlatans, and egomaniacs will not move us forward. Beware! Science and the general scientific method will even- tually answer all of the questions about the UFO. Lets renew our commitment to science and move forward from now. THE GLASS CEILING by John S. Waddell, Ph.D. U FO researchers often ask themselves in frustra- tion, Why won't the mainstream culture take this phenomenon seriously? Researchers have been able to document literally thousands of encounters, and have often been able to provide evidence at levels that under normal circumstances would be accepted by the scientific community or in a court of law. Yet, there has never been official acknowledgment of even one ETI contact, or that the evidence taken as a whole has any validity. This has usually been blamed on the resistance of the scientific community to accept a new paradigm and the refusal of the defense establishment to give up its se- crets. However, the number and variety of reports keep JULY 1996     NUMBER 339 piling up and are shown on television almost weekly, yet there is comparatively little impact on public con- sciousness. There appears to be a glass ceiling made up of the public's (often unconscious) fear of what contact would mean. Even if visiting aliens are benign, their existence would certainly require a massive adjustment to our re- ligious and cultural views. Our place in the universe would be changed forever. We would no longer be the masters of our Earthly destiny, but dependent to some extent on the goodwill of \"alien\" beings whose inten- tions we could only surmise. These are issues that can certainly evoke fear. People who are ready to face them, such as those of you reading PACE 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL In many respects, the battle has not been between secretive governments and the public's right to know, but between the peo- ple who have the courage to seriously ad- dress ETI contact and the public's right not to know. this, have sought out the abundant unofficial information available. Most people, however, prefer to ignore these issues, and choose either to dismiss the subject of ETI contact altogether, or relegate it to titillation. The latter would be similar to speculating about who killed President Kennedy. It is fascinating to think the CIA might have assassinated Kennedy, for example, but un- less this would be confirmed officially, people do riot have to deal with the difficult questions about what this would mean to our democracy. Likewise, many people tell pollsters they believe UFOs are \"real,\" but most of these people would prob- ably also say that humans are the most advanced species on the planet. Only when it is officially confirmed that we are not, will these people really have to face the difficult psychological and cultural issues surrounding ETI contact. Many folks interested in UFO research have been frustrated by the various governments' lack of forth- rightness in these matters, just as many were frustrated by the sealing of the Kennedy files. However, the pub- lic at large, perhaps for similar reasons, has been largely content to leave knowledge about both issues at the level of speculation. Some would assert that this is because the public has been hoodwinked by the government. But those of you reading this and those answering the polls, obvi- ously have not. People say they believe UFOs are out there, and they watch shows about Roswell, but they do not insist that their leaders get to the bottom of this. If they did, the evidence would come out. With the possi- ble exception of Congressman Schiff, there is no polit- ical leader in America whose job would be at risk for not pushing an investigation into these issues. Many focus their frustrations on shadowy, unelected government leaders, while ignoring what may be the greatest barrier to official acknowledgment of the evi- dence: the public's ambivalence about facing the pro- found psychological and cultural impact of becoming the second most advanced species on \"our\" planet. W hatever aliens are out there have also conspired to deny us proof of their existence. Some attribute darker motives to visiting aliens, but it is quite possible they are sensitive to our psychological needs and have chosen not to force their existence upon the many who would be devastated. Because of these barriers, those of us who take UFO research seriously are like a football team that has never won a game (and we get about the same level of re- spect). We have scored some points, and there have been personal victories, but neither we nor our work has been honored by the mainstream culture. For this to change, something will have to happen to make the possibility of alien contact psychologically real for the public, just as something happened to make it real for us. For some, this is simply a matter of expo- sure to the abundant evidence. However, for the major- ity, it appears only a significant lowering of the psy- chological barriers will allow the UFO phenomenon to become real. This could happen through the presentation of shock- ing, irrefutable evidence that will literally crush these barriers, or through individuals making peace with the frightening possibilities implied by alien contact. UFO researchers seem to have been largely focused on the former, and the alien visitors frequently on the latter. Psychological barriers to knowledge are often adap- tive, and the pain to the personality can be extreme if the barriers are removed without adequate support. Trying to force people to face situations which they are not ready to handle can be painful both for those receiving the message and for the messengers. The most common defense against facts which people are not ready to hear is to ridicule the messengerâ€”something which those of you reading this know all too well. In many respects, the battle has not been between se- cretive governments and the public's right to know, but between the people who have the courage to seriously address ETI contact and the public's right not to know. Sooner or later, however, there will be an incident which will break into public consciousness, and both the public and our leaders will have to scramble to come to terms with the implications of contact. Those of us who have been willing to face these issues can help facilitate a process whereby both the public and our leaders are prepared, and where a breakthrough will be as minimally threatening as possible. This can be done by continuing the development of physical evidence, and concurrently, addressing the pro- found issues implied by that evidence. Finally, the recog- nition that there is a glass ceiling made up of public fear, can reduce the frustration of UFO researchers when, again and again, the mainstream culture refuses to ac- knowledge the abundant evidence.

Ufology Research of Manitoba, working in coopera- tion with researchers across Canada, has released its review of Canadian UFO cases reported from 1994 to 1995. The study used case reports from both government records and private UFO groups. \"UFO sightings continue to be reported at a constant rate,\" says Chris Rutkowski, an astronomer and sci- ence writer in Winnipeg who for the past 21 years has been studying UFO reports in Canada. \"People still re- port observing unusual objects in the sky, and some of these objects do not have obvious explanations.\" According to the study: the typical UFO sighting oc- curs at about 9:00 p.m.; most sightings have two wit- nesses; there are more UFOs seen on the prairies than in Ontario or Quebec; many witnesses are pilots, police and other individuals with reasonably good observing capa- bilities and good judgement. Although most cases had explanations, a small percentage were not that easy to dismiss. \"We were still left with some cases that were well-in- vestigated and involved unusual objects that did not seem to have been airplanes, balloons or stars,\" Rutkowski notes. \"The continued reporting of UFOs leads us to recommend more studies of the phenomenon by social, medical and/or physical scientists.\" Among the unknowns were a disc-shaped object that flew circles around a plane over Northern Ontario and several reports of black triangles which were seen over Alberta and BC. The explainable cases included a bright light seen by 200 people over St. Theresa Point, Manitoba, and a strange luminous flying object that turned out to be a police surveillance aircraft. \"UFOs simply haven't gone away,\" adds Rutkowski.

There are ap- proximately 180 cases of unidentified flying objects re- ported each year. â€¢ The distribution of UFO reports in Canada is not re- lated to the distribution of population. Western Canada is over-represented in terms of UFO report numbers. â€¢ During the past seven years, there was no definite monthly trend found in Canadian UFO reports. Each year, there appear to be regional monthly fluctuations. â€¢ Approximately 70% of all UFO sightings are merely observations of lights in the night sky. â€¢ About 13% of all UFO reports are unexplained. This percentage of unknowns falls to about 2% when only high-quality cases are considered. â€¢ Most UFO sightings occur between 9:00 pm and midnight. UFO incidents usually have more than one wit- ness. â€¢ In 1994-95. the typical UFO sighting lasted seven minutes. â€¢ Most reported UFOs are white or red in colour.

None of the forms of mental/thought trans- ference â€” telepathy, channeling, reading minds. E.S.P., etc. â€” has ever been soundly and scientifically proven as real. Nevertheless, belief in these elusive phenomena persists, and they are even accepted as part of our real- ity by large numbers of people. As abduction researchers who are attempting to present factual and convincing data to the general public as well as the scientific com- munity, we are confounded in nearly every case with the existence of a telepathic form of communication. If there is any type of communication between human be- ings and otherworldly visitors, it seems to be telepathic 95 to 99 percent of the time. That, in itself, is an in- credibly high correlational statistic that places the inci- dence of this form of communication well above chance or fantasy. Indeed, if imagination were the source for such accounts, we would hear about an endless assort- ment of clicks, grunts, squeals, babbles, robotic, choral, melodic, whispering, sultry, seductive, commanding, intense, or squeaky voices, and even visual gesturing. The tone, frequency, and speed of speech would also be reported in a variety of creative ways. Although the same high incidence of telepathy is re- ported within approximately 100 of my cases (that report communication), not one subject has ever used the term telepathy to describe his/her experience during recall. Instead, each subject has used an interesting assortment of experiential descriptions: \"I don't hear voices, but I can hear their thoughts \" \"It's as if their thoughts are in my head,\" \"I don't know how I can do this, but I just know what they are telling me,\" \"I don't hear with my ears. This is weird. They knew what I had just thought and put an answer in my head,\" \"The eyes are penetrat- ing and speak to me.\" \"The mouth never moves to speak, but their thoughts are like a clear voice in my mind.\" Even with any of my notorious leading and sug- gestive \"trick\" questions, i.e.â€” \"When the mouth opens, do you hear a high, medium, or low-pitched voice?\" â€” not one subject has followed the lead of such a seem- ingly logical question. A number of participants in these reported encounters tells of receiving telepathic communications between alleged abductions. Although this type of report might begin to look and sound like channeling, these subjects indicate that the messages come unexpectedly â€” inter- rupting work or activities without any warning, solici- tation, or apparent purpose. Subjects frequently add that the messages are bothersome, undesired, confusing, or too complex. As one country girl told me, \"Why don't they tell someone who cares â€” and leave me alone!\" Occasionally, abductees report that they do not recognize some of the \"transmitted\" words. They run to grab a pencil, write it down, and then discover the word later in the dictionary â€” much to their own surprise! They also may tell me that if they had not written the message down, they would not likely have remembered it. This would be like making notes from watching a televised program, attempting to capture the essence of an exter- nally-produced signal. Internally-fabricated, imagined, delusional, or creative notions would probably be much more easily recalled since we are the source of that sig- nal. Could alien beings project a mental signal or message from a distance? There certainly are plenty of cases which describe the eyes as very powerful, penetrating, and persuasive. Reported telepathic incidents also in- clude the transmission of various images and holo- graphic scenes. A number of abductees describe these \"long-distance\" messages as visual imagery initially. Just because they are no longer face-to-face in front of a person would not rule out the possibility of a long-dis- tance contact. Numerous cases include nighttime inci- dents in which the subject is awakened by hearing his name called. He may also hear other sounds, tones, beeps, or noises which get his attention. Those who hear their name called often describe wandering through the house and even outside. Once outside, a beam of blue-white light may pick them up, or they may drive to a remote location where the craft awaits. This would cer- tainly tend to suggest a direct link between the long-dis- tance \"call\" and the subsequent encounter aboard a craft with those who \"placed the call.\" Because these beings seem so masterful with telepathy, it is easier to accept that a mental connection at such a distance is indeed likely. Because there is a high incidence of psychic ability among life-long abductees, I suspect that this long-term involvement with E.T.-induced telepathy has \"exercised\" human brains, enhancing telepathic skills, which can then operate beyond E.T. encounters and with human affairs. Channeling, on the other hand, is viewed as the at- tempt to elicit, invite, allow, and welcome contact with other beings, spirits, dimensions, etc. Whether or not these human-initiated contacts are authentic, the infor- mation generated can be intriguing, enlightening, and even entertaining. When humans desire such informa- tion, this then invites the subconscious mind to feed the hungry questions of the conscious mind. In other words, we can innocently fabricate incredibly intelligent and creative information â€” in fact, so skillfully that we would never believe that it came from within us. Occasionally one will experience such an imaginative dream and then doubt his own inner ability to have constructed it. PACE 18 NUMBER 339 JULY 1996"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL The big question remains: Who is the source for channeled information? Can humans really initiate this kind of contact when they have typically failed to initi- ate face-to-face contacts â€” despite the most sincere and determined efforts? And why would E.T.'s tell us anything? In approximately 90 percent of the cases of mine and other noteworthy researchers the only com- munication, if any, is essentially: \"You'll be fine/Hold still/You won't be harmed/You'll be back home soon\" - - much like a nurse would tell a child in a doctor's of- fice. Therefore, would these beings really offer large amounts of detailed information when we ask for it, when they typically rarely do so during face-to-face encounters? Or do we generate it innocently, subcon- sciously, out of our insatiable need to know? I do not know these answers, and I will not dismiss any possi- bility. I would like to invite any abductee who feels he/she is in telepathic contact (rather often) to participate by mail in a new research study of mine. Perhaps we can learn something more helpful toward answering these questions. (If interested, contact Carpenter c/o MUFON or by e- mail at StarmanJC@aol.com.) Letters to Mufon UFO Journal DEAR EDITOR: While I appreciate Karl T. Pflock's kind remarks (MU- FON UFO Journal. June, 1996 issue) about my re- cently published High Strangeness (Volume 3 of the UFO Encyclopedia), I am a bit baffled by his criticisms â€” which is not to say, of course, that the book is perfect. Far from it. But I do plead innocent to the curious charges he levels. One is that I suffer from bouts of \"enthusiasm,\" ap- parently in evidence only when I express a point of view with which Pflock happens to disagree. Believe me, whatever \"enthusiasm\" one starts out with, it has pretty well dissipated by the time one has finished 400,000 words' worth of publishable text. In any event, my judgments ofdebunkers' claims about major cases had nothing to do with enthusiasm and everything to do with a conviction, based on many years' observation and reflection, that Klass, Sheaffer. et al., have not, as Jung wrote of Menzel, \"succeeded, despite all [their] efforts, in offering a satisfying scientific explanation of even one authentic UFO report.\" My book makes clear why I have come to that conclusion, and if Pflock feels other- wise (i.e., that debunkers' claims are, as he would have it, \"not unreasonable\"), he ought to write his own book and do his best to turn these sow's ears into silk purses. I certainly did' not misrepresent Sheaffer's views about ufology, either in the specific quote (where Pflock draws a distinction without a difference) or in the larger argument made in The UFO Verdict (1981). What sur- prises me is that Pflock cites Sheaffer's characterization of ufology \"as a powerful social movement\" as if it (1) did not validate my remark about his extremism and (2) were not about as lunatic â€” and comic â€” an inflation of ufology's cultural and political significance as has ever been committed to print. Pflock's assertion that I give Stanton Friedman's views \"short shrift\" is mystifying, especially when the biographical entry on him (in the first volume, UFOs in the 1980s) is among the longer such pieces and contains nothing critical. In the three Encyclopedia volumes Jacques Vallee's contributions to our field get full credit and respect, as readers can easily determine for them- selves by consulting the cumulative index in Strangeness. Far from giving them short shrift when I offer criticisms, I examine Vallee's theories in detail; see, for example, 1980s, pp. 173-77, and Strangeness. 374- 78. Strangeness contains many criticisms of ufologists' shortcomings. Thus Pflock's (otherwise flattering) allu- sion to Boswell, who \"all too often favored Dr. Johnson,\" makes no sense. Pflock could more usefully turn his sights on debunkers' excesses. After all, has a debunker ever cast a critical eye on another debunker - - or, for that matter, ever uttered the fatal words \"I don't know\"? â€”Jerome Clark Canby, Minnesota RIGHT TO KNOW Does the UFO community have the political will to solve the UFO mystery? If our answer is \"yes.\" then I believe that the time necessary to identify the UFOs will be greatly shortened. So far, however, with some notable exceptions, our answer seems to be a resounding \"no!\" The \"science only\" approach to ufology favored by MUFON and most other UFO organizations has un- questionably generated valuable UFO data, but the in- formation has been largely ignored or suppressed by government and science, leaving the lay public ignorant and confused. No matter how compelling the scientific evidence presented, it can be denied when politically ex- pedient, thereby lessening its impact on the general public. The Condon report and the accompanying Air Force statement announcing the end of Project Blue Book in 1969 exemplify the political and scientific denial of the UFO question. Despite compelling evidence to the con- trary, the Air Force maintained that, scientifically, UFOs did not represent anything new or even anything worthy of further Air Force study. The National Academy of Sciences endorsed this unscientific conclusion and of- fered the political opinion that the UFO subject was not \"shrouded in official secrecy.\" The Air Force di- rected citizens to report UFO sightings to universities or JULY 1996 NUMBER 339 PAGE 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL private UFO research organizations to ensure that \"sound evidence is not overlooked by the scientific community.\" Despite the overwhelming scientific evidence ob- tained since 1969 by groups such as MUFON demon- strating that some UFOs are real objects of unknown ori- gin, the latest Air Force policy statement asserts that, \"Since the termination of Project Blue Book, nothing has occurred that would support a resumption of UFO in- vestigations by the Air Force.\" If the purpose of MUFON is simply to investigate UFO phenomena scientifically, then we are doing a good job. One could even argue that we are cooperating fully with the role assigned us by the Air Force in 1969, (that is, to effectively replace Project Blue Book as an open source of civilian UFO reports and investigation). If, however, our purpose is to solve the UFO mystery, then we are not doing at all well. So far, groups such as Operation Right to Know that seek a political solution to UFOs have not been well supported by the UFO mainstream. Why? Is a policy of open government really so politically controversial that the UFO community can't support it? If the govern- ment has secretly identified the UFOs, don't we have a right to know? Do we really think that Roswell was just about Reynolds Wrap and balsa wood? The \"science only\" approach to UFOs simply has not worked. We need political action to uncover classified information and to give voice to our scientific findings. What better time than this election year for the major UFO organizations to start making some political de- mands? Let's demand that congressional hearings be held into the UFO cover-up. Let's demand that our sci- entific UFO data be given serious evaluation by our government. Let's demand that our government do its job properly by investigating UFO phenomena openly. Let's resolve to make these demands a priority within the UFO community. Until we do, our valuable scientific work will continue to go unheeded by the political and scientific establishments and the American public's right to know will continue to be trampled upon. â€”Larry Ouderkirk Frederick, MD Address your comments to the editor, PO Box 12434, San Antonio, TX 78212. NET NEWS - Continued from Page 17 The most important findings of this study include the fact that UFO sightings have continued to be re- ported at a constant level over the past several years. People still report observing unusual objects in the sky, and some of these objects do not have obvious expla- nations. Many witnesses are pilots, police and other in- dividuals with reasonably good observing capabilities and good judgement. Although most reported UFOs are simply lights in the night sky, a significant number are objects with definite shapes observed within the witnesses' frame of reference. Popular opinion to the contrary, there is yet to be any incontrovertible evidence that some UFO cases in- volve extraterrestrial contact. However, the continued re- porting of UFOs by the public suggests a need for fur- ther examination of the phenomenon by social, medical and/or physical scientists.

The big planet is near the globular star cluster M22. Saturn (0.6), in Cetus, rises in the E about 9:30 PM in mid- August. It advances to the west, reflecting Earth's eastward spin. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus (-4.3) rises in the NE soon after 2 AM, reaching great- est elongation 46Â° west of the Sun on the 20th. Our brilliant neighbor lies near the lunar crescent on August 10. During the month Venus closes to within 3Â° of Mars (more than 200 times dimmer than Venus). Mars (1.5). in Gemini, rises in the NE about 2:30 AM in midmonth. See Venus. Jupiter sets in the WSW about 2 AM in mid-August. Saturn lies in the SSW at dawn. Meteor Showers: This year's Perseid display is unhampered by moonlight and so the shower's peak on the morning of August 12 should be worth watching. The bright yellow meteors increase to be- tween 50 and 100 per hour before dawn, radiating across the sky from the NE. The slower Delta Aquarids, emanating from the S, join the Perseids during the first half of the month. Moon Phases: Last quarterâ€”August 6 New moonâ€”August 14 First quarterâ€”August 21 Full moonâ€”August 28 The Stars: August evenings bring the Summer Triangle high overhead. This very obvious right triangle is composed of the brightest stars of three separate constellations. Vega, 3rd brightest star in Northern Hemisphere skies, lies in Lyra, the Lyre or Harp. (Look for a crooked rectangle.) East of Vega is the star Deneb, the tail of Cygnus the Swan. Cygnus is often nicknamed the Northern Cross, with Deneb the top of the cross. Albireo, the head of the swan, is a spec- tacular blue and gold double star in a small telescope. (The star appears single to the unaided eye.) Finally, Altair forms the southern corner of the triangle. The star marks the head of Aquila the Eagle. With some care, it is possible to discern two outstretched wings and a pointed tail. The eagle and swan fly on grazing paths in opposite directions along the Milky Way. July 5-7 â€” Twenty-seventh annual MUFON International UFO Symposium, Holiday Inn Four Seasons/Joseph H.

Bill's phone number at the above location is (501)484-7512. Since Mr. Pitts is retiring from business, he has taken this opportunity to also retire \"The New Project Blue Book\" organization which he founded in 1988. MUFON NATIONAL UFO HOTLINE MUFON has been introducing its National UFO Hotline 1-800-UFO-2166 or 1-800-836-2166 to the public. Designed to obtain UFO sighting reports from police agencies nationwide, we are now prepared to expand its coverage. All State Directors were advised by a letter nearly a year ago to utilize this number for filing hot UFO cases that came to their attention. A letter an- nouncing the 800 number was mailed to all sheriff's of- fices and police chiefs in Texas during the spring of 1995 as a means of testing and evaluating the effective- ness of the system. The majority of our calls, to-date, have been from people who called the 800 directory and asked for \"UFO\" to report sightings or to seek UFO information. To send letters to every police department and sher- iff's office throughout the U.S.A. would obviously be both expensive and time-consuming. We would like for every State Director, State Section Director, Field Investigator, and Field Investigator Trainee to notify your local sheriff, police chief, and state highway patrol offide of MUFON's 800 number via a postcard that they may post on their bulletin boards or at the dis- patcher's desk. Presently, we are attempting to answer all calls \"live.\" An answering box records the calls received late at night or early mornings. These sighting reports will be mailed or telephoned to the nearest State Section Director, State Director, or Field Investigator for a per- sonal interview. Brief replies to these cases under in- vestigation may be made to MUFON on the 800 num- ber. (The answering box is limited to three minutes.) However, this number is not to be used for other MU- FON communications. The MUFON business office number is (210) 379-9216. Please advise Walt Andrus by postcard or letter to which agencies you filed the UFO hotline number 1-800-UFO-2166. We thank each and everyone of you who advised MUFON this month that you had made the 800 UFO hotline number avail- able to police agencies in your immediate area. GRAND OPENING OF UFO & SPACE MUSEUM The new multi-million dollar UFO & Space Museum in Hakui City, Japan will open early in July 1996. The opening ceremony on July 1st is by invitation only. The major financing for this beautiful and practical exhibit hall was made possible by the Japanese government. International aero-space companies, NASA, etc., have assembled life-size exhibits for the public to view. Obviously. UFO exhibits predominate, thus the name of the museum. MUFON was contacted by the founders of the museum during the planning stage, however, we were not invited to provide an exhibit. After opening our own UFO INFORMATION CEN- TER in Seguin, Texas on March 14, 1995, photo ex- hibits, models, and wall plaques have been installed lo- cally. We are indebted to members such as Paul Cerny (San Jose, CA). Robert Taylor (Fort Wayne, IN). Robert Turner (Santa Fe, NM), and John Schuessler (Houston.
