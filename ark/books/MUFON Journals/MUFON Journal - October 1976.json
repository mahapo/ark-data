FROM THE EDITOR This month proved to be a milestone for ufology as the Prime Minister of Grenada ad- dressed the 31st Session of the United Nations on the sub- ject of UFOs. Prime Minister Eric M. Gairy told the United Nations member-nations that it was time they took a serious look at the worldwide UFO pro- blem. He called for a sci- entific effort to be made un- der the direction of the UN to find out what UFOs are and whether they are under intel- ligent direction. Whatever Mr. Gairy's mot- ives were, his remarks had a spectacular effect on official representatives of nations from around the world and mark a changing attitude on the part of several governments. West Germany, Trinidad, Bra- zil, Indonesia, France and Mexico all seem to be start- ing to take UFOs seriously. This is certainly a step in the right direction! I recently had the opport- unity to sample this changing attitude as a featured speaker at the First National UFO Con- gress held in Mexico City. The respect for an empirical, sci- entific approach was evident in the remarks of many of the participants. In addition, the Congress inaugurated a Center for UFO Information and Study (CIFOP) to invest- igate UFOs and disseminate UFO information in Mexico. The Center now has a two-story building in Mexico City with classrooms, laboratory, and library facilities. Efforts are now underway to organize a truly international confer- ence to be held in April of 197? in Acapulco. The con- ference will last a full week and will bring scientists, ufo- logists, and government leaders together to try to organize a sensible, worldwide program for the investigation of the UFO phenomenon.

His wife and two small children, 8 and 10, were asleep in bed. At about 12:45 A.M., the TV suddenly went dead, as did the air conditioners. Thinking the circuit breaker had kicked out from a short somewhere, Pecha went outside in his shorts to reset the breaker. As he approached the corner of his mobile home, he became in- creasingly aware of a static elec- tricity effect on his body. Thie hair on his chest, arms, and head began to stand up as if being pulled upward. As He reached the corner of the house, his hair began to crackle and snap similar to run- ning a nylon:comb through dry hair very rapidly. ' Position of L â€¢10 0 6 9 r 5 Q.

The awesome sight of some strange and unknown craft silent- ly hovering mostly over his barn and the corner of his mobile home startled him. All the sensation he felt was the electrostatic phenomena causing his hair to stand on end. We was aware that his heart was pounding very fast in response to the .excitement. Standing there in apprehensive amazement and becoming in- creasingly frightened of the awesome spectacle almost over him, he was still inquisitive enough to take in the intricate detail of the craft. He told the Mufon investigators he must have stood there for four, or five minutes."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Estimated diameter was 140 feet. There were no rivits, no bolts or screws, no seams, he com- mented. In his profession, thse are familiar things. The dome had vertical ribbed sections, the \"rib- bing\" quite pronounced. Between each ribbed section, the surface was quite concave (inward) and reminded Pecha of the old fahioned glass lemon juice squeezer in structure. The dome had a slight peak or point. The up- per domed area and its im- mediate flared out base section had the appearance of mildly rough and porous \"slag.\" This up- per area was dark gray or dull silvery in color. The second rounded and flared out area leading toward the edge of the craft appeared to have a surface appearance of procelain. The edges of the craft and the perimeter that was rotating clockwise looked more like stainless steel. The rotation rate was difficult to determine, but Pecha indicated it was quite rapid. A smaller sec- tion in the bottom of the disc, sur- rounding a large diameter light source, was rotating Pech=t mobile home and TV antenna S. a counterclockwise and revolving much slower than the rim. No air disturbance could be detected from the rotating areas. Pecha stated that the unusual lighting and large center light which was giving off only a mild, dini, gray color illumination in the hovering state, could have possibly caused an optical illusion of the two spin- ning portions being in opposite Barn and home with the \"Field\" out in \"background directions. However, he got the distinct impression they were spinning contrary to one another. The six dangling objects hang- ing down, apparently from the edge facing the observer, gave the appearance of. loosely dangling heavy flexible conduit with frayed ends. They were hanging down about six to eight feet from the bottom of the craft. The three on the left (see sketch) were stag- gered in length to match the slan- ting roof of the barn they were over but not quite touching. The \"conduit\" appeared to be an estimated two or three inches in dimeter. When the craft retreated back over the field behind the Pecha home, these appendages were im- meidately retracted into the bot- tom. The two hook-like arms on the bottom also retracted upward, but not completely into the hull. At the same time, as if they were part of the same arm or mechanism, a small door opened on each side just above the arms and a light seemingly mounted on a curved piece of tubing pro- truded out and slightly downward.

These two side lights sent out a bluish- white beam of light. As the UFO backed away toward the Slim Davis home and crop dusting airfield a half mile behind the Pecha home, the large red light in front came on. The large center bottom light which was dull gray at hovering, now in- tensified to a bright white cone shaped beam downward which reached only half the way to the ground and stopped in mid-air! Cut off beams of light from UFOs have been noted on occasion. Pecha watched the large UFO maneuver over the Davis home and aifield hanger, lighting up everything like daylight including the trees and ground. At this mo- ment, he noticed that two other similar UFOs about half the size of the large one were hovering directly over the 500 KVA (500,000 volt) power lines a couple hun- dred yards beyond the Davis airstrip. These two identical craft appeared to be almost resting on the lines, each one between two power poles but separated by one span section between poles. Each UFO was shining a powerful col- 3-rrn and slanted roof area where aopend^ges runs over slant roof. umn of white lighl Irom its side edges down onlo the tops of the powerpoles on either side of it. There was one span unoccupied in between. (See sketches) Inside each of these columns of light was an inner blue pulsing core. The power lines themselves were glowing red for some distance out on each side of the poles. Here is an actual visual example, in Cropdustlng field behind Davis lines behind field. detail, of an apparent blackout in process being caused by two UFO craft over a high voltage power line, observed and witnessd by Bill Pecha and his wife. At this point, Pecha ran into the house shouting for his wife to get up. He rushed to the window fac- ing the back field where the UFO had backed off, pushing the cur- tains aside so he could see. At this time, the large craft was hovering over the Davis home. The large bottom light was now extended to the ground, maneuvering around the Davis home and airfield hanger, lighting everything up like daylight. Lenda Pecha by now had joined her husband after arousing her from sleep by his shouting and stumbling through the blacked- out house to both observe the strange pheonomena now taking place over the Davis home and the nearby power lines. After spen- ding about a minute over the Davis home and airfield, brilliant- ly i 1 luminating the whole im- mediate area, the large UFO sud- denly shot off at incredible speed toward the foothills as Bill and Lenda watched from the window"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Power lines where smaller UFO's hovered causing blackout. power lines & poles Field out In back toward home A airfield. 'Pwr llnes{ bkgrd) The foothills are approximately 18-20 miles distant to the west. Pecha commented the large UFO travelled this distance in a matter of 2-3 seconds and he observed it shinning its powerful bottom light down onto the tops of the hills for a second or two when it rushed back at the same velocit to once again hover over the Davis home, repeating the illumination pat- terns over the Davis property. Everywhere around the im- mediate countryside all the lights were off, ranch yard lights and the whole town was in darkness except for the moonlight and the UFOs. Pecha stated that watching this light beaming procedure began to unnerve him if it should return to his place and begin doing the same thing, not knowing what ef- fect was taking place at the Davis home, if possibly harmful. Fear- ing for the safety of his family and himself, he was about to turn from the window when he saw both UFOs over the power lines sud- denly break away at the same time, shooting up and out of sigh t. Pecha decided it was time to flee the house in case the still pre- sent large intruder came back their way. In his frantic haste to get away, he pulled on a pair of old \"jeans,\" grabbed the children, bed clothes and all, his wife, and headed for the door. Just then the T.V. and air condi- tioner came back on. Noticing this, he instictively hit the off but- ton shutting the TV off on his way out the door. Piling the family in- side his new pickup truck, he raced backwards out the driveway with the lights deliberately turned off, but forgot about the truck's backup lights being on, which may have at- tracted the UFO. As he raced down the blacktop road toward town at speeds up to what he assumed may have been 90 miles per hour, he noticed the large craft following their truck. Glanc- ing back to watch the UFO while driving with no lights down the moonlit road at those speeds was probably a crazy thing to do he ad- mits, but all he could think of at the time was to get away from this strange machine and get his fami- ly to the somewhat more safety of the town. Pacific Gas and Electric (P.G.E.) personnel stated there was a blackout of undetermined nature. They would not admit to any such explanation as a UFO causing it. The transmissions lines, which were stated to be 500 KVA, were said to come from the Redding-Shasta area.

Sheriff's Department employee, Elaine McGowen, and her 18 year old son, Fred, also observed the object at a mile or two distance. Davis home and airfield - some leaves on top of the threes were turning brown, some just half brown as if heated or scorched, especially near the house - samples were taken. Analysis will be attempted. One small pear tree and a nearby lilac bush have never bloomed this time of year (late October) before. Other areas of the town of Colusa were checked for similar possible off- season blooming, but none could be found except on the Davis pro- perty. The pear tree was slightly scorched or damaged on one side. At the time of the sighting and when the UFO was over the Davis residence, their dogs reacted, howling and barking in an unusual manner.

Note This summary is based on an investigation report fay Yves Toussainf of SOBERS, Bruxe//es, Belgium. Its unusual features, and the fact that the sighting occurred during the fall 1973 wave, make it of special interest). About 7:45 p.m. on September 14, 1973, Miss Sonia Plume and her father were driving from Cuesmes toward Mons on the rue du Troubliot, Belgium. Night was falling and the moon was visible in the east, almost in front of them. The area they were passing through was essentially nothing but swamp, bordered on three sides by railways. As they roun- ded a bend in the road, Sonia sud- denly saw a lighted object similar in shape to a flower pot hovering about 200 m off the left side of the road and about 200 m altitude. It was almost directly over an elec- tric power building, and about 80 m away from a high voltage live. Her father, who was driving, saw only an orange blur due to his astigmatic vision. The UFO appeared to be about the size of a small car, with a jagged, saw-tooth upper edge. At each extreme of the top a short, slanted \"aerial,\" sparkling with yellow lights, protruded, (see sketch). The body of the object and the aerials were a bright orange color. Yellow lights also sparkled at each \"corner\" of the base. The area between the aerials and just below the jagged edge appeared foggy and dazzling to the eye, and a lighter color. The object was self-luminous but did not illuminate its surroundings. It seemed to be vibrating slightly. As they pulled abreast of the electric power building and slowed to stop at an intersection, now only about 50 m from the building, the colors on the UFO faded and the outline blurred as it dipped to the right and flew away in the direction of Ciply, rising gradually in a slight curve. Its speed was moderate, slower than a plane. As they stopped for the in- tersection, Sonia's attention was diverted momentarily, and when she looked again the object had disappeared. She felt that she should have been able to still see it disappearing in the distance. No effects were noted on the car, a *Dyane6* The sighting is compared to a previous one on March 14,1969 at Malataverne in which the witness saw a somewhat similar UFO with jagged top and aerials. The SOBEPS investigators con- sidered, and rejected, the possibility that Sonia had been in- fluenced by the earlier report. They also reconstructed the even- ts on the spot, disputing the wit- ness' estimate of 3 minutes sighting duration; the recon- struction took about 1 Vfe minutes. However, they found no evidence of a hoax. Miss Plume, 20, was considered a calm and intelligent witness. She is pursuing studies at the County Institute for Applied Social Science."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"CALIFORNIA REPORT 'Oddities Among the Erratics 7 ' by Ann Druffel (Part2) We continue our discussion of \"oddities\" in UFOdom, as oc- casionally reported by reliable witnesses in California and, sub- sequently, from other parts of the nation, and we will attempt some speculation why these unusually- shaped UFOs show up repeatedly, within a limited span of time, and then are seen no more. We might reiterate here that UFO \"oddities\", as defined in this two-part article,, differ - in size, shape and detail from the more common types which have recurred century after century â€”. domed discs, ovoid lights, cloud- cigars,etc. Added to our procession of 1. gleaming \"top hats\", 2. geranium, pots, and 3. \"lozenges\" which seemingly have ability to change shape, as discussed in Part I, (June 1976, this journal), we proceed to a type which might be called the \"scintillating globe\". In the wee hours of the morning of May 23, 1974 a brilliant sphere swooped low over a heavily set- tled residential area of Los Angeles. It seemed divided into two portions. The bottom ap- peared sprinkled with intensely flashing lights, while the top gave off a milky glow. The object siler- tly meandered close to a womrn witness who was standing on ht * back porch, engaged in a mun, dane task of shaking a pair of drapes. (Sketch A) Its true size seemed at least six to eight feet, diameter. After negotiating a heat path through' the trees in the wit- ness' back yard, it leaped up. diagonally into the sky. The lights on the back of the sphere were not so brilliant as on the front, and the witness, Mrs. Ethel Bergman, could see a \"fin\" sticking out from the bottom. (Sketch B) 1,2 Unknown to the Los Angeles witness, on November 29th of the previous year,'a young man had .been startled by a \"wildly lighted\" UFO which was wan- dering slowly, around a rural'sec: tion of Weatherford, Oklahoma. It hovered near a bridge within thir- ty feet of the nervous witness who, unfortunately, desired to 'drive across that same bridge in his car. A sketch of this intruder ^reveals several correlative features with Ethel Bergman's object. One half of the Weather- ford UFO â€” in this case the top â€” was covered with ^numerous flashing white, red and blue lights, while'the bottom was less vivid. The size in both cases seemed generally similar. Both objects made seemingly casual â€” but curious? â€” close approaches to single witnesses. And both the Weatherford and Los Angeles ob- jects had a \"fin\" or appendage. (Sketch C) The proportionate size, shape, and position of these appurtenances were virtually identical. 3 Leaving these wildly-lighted UFOs trailing their fins, we con- sider now the \"double UFOs\". On October 16, 1968 on a bright, smogless morning, two large round circles, dull steer in color and connected by a \"bar\" of similar appearance sailed across a densely settled section of Los : Angeles, before the startled;;eyes of Harriet and Rochelle;VDzik. Moving very smoothly and .deliberately and emitting a high whistling sound, the double object seemingly treated-the skies as its own'. ('Sketch DO'4 About two years later, an almost identical object startled Michael Jaffe, a well-known UFO researcher and founder of Data- Net. While motorcycling along a . main highway near Hayward, California Mr. Jaffe spied an ob- ject composed of two brilliant spheres with a hazy \"connection\" or link. (Sketch E) ugh identical in shape to that seen in 1968 by the Dzik sisters, 350 air miles to the southeast, Jaffe's object was not sailing undisturbed and tranquilly in an ; empty sky. His \"double- UFO\" was being chased by a small plane, and its two spheres were glowing vivid red and blue, perhaps because of the object's acceleration, angle of dive, or speed. 5,6 What are we to think of these \"oddities\"? Does every one-of-a- kind UFO have one or more coun- terparts, witnessed within limited spans of time and in the same general part of the world?

In spite of the present, popularity of the ultradimensional hypothesis and other exotic speculations, many researchers are convinced that a single hypothesis will not explain all genuine UFO sightings. Is it not reasonable to think that at least some UFOs are visitors from other sources in our own physical universe, and that once they have surveyed us, they leave without a farethewell. The above would seem to be a simple theory indeed â€” simple in more ways than one â€” to the javerage interested layman who assumes that all UFOs are ex- traterrestrial visitors and who knows nothing of the more exotic theories â€” . ultradimensional, projections, etc. â€” being discussed among researchers at .the present time.

MUFON IN... AUSTRALIA The resignation of Michael A. Guider as Representative for Australia, in February, has brought about a re-assessment and reorganization in that country due to its size. Mr Guider served MUFON for two ; years, and we wish to publicly thank him for his efforts. He has recommended W.C. (\"Bill\") Chalker as his replacement. Since Australia consists of six states and two territories com- prising an aggregate of close to 3 million square miles, it has been -decided that it would be more practical to 'appoint represen- tatives for each of the major political units (excluding the Australian Capital Territory and Canberra, which is a relatively small area embedded in New South Wales). The following appointments have been (or will be) made for State Representatives: New South Walesâ€”Bill Chalker (Industrial Chemist); Terry Bishop, (Field Investigator) South Australiaâ€”Keith Baster- field (Research Officer for UFO Research) , Tasmaniaâ€”Paul Jackson (U.F.O. Investigation Centre) Personnel in the remaining states in dude: . Queenslandâ€”John E; Pattison, Field Investigator _â€¢'./' Victoriaâ€”Tony Teboneras, Field Investigator Trainee: : At present there are no MUFON personnel in Western Australia (Encompassing 976,000 square miles) or the Northern Territory (520,000 square miles). Bill Chalker and Keith Baster- field have notified me that a Close Encounter Catalogue for Australia is nearly completed, in- cluding about 38 occupant reports and 87 physical trace cases. PILOT EXPERIENCES ELECTROMAGNETIC EFFECTS The details of a case in which a UFO was associated with severe electro-magnetic effects on an aircraft have been confirmed to MUFON by Vic Harris, Editor of Spaceview in Auckland, N.Z. Although the case is \"dated\" by newspaper standards, it has im- portant implications for un- derstanding the forces apparently genera ted by UFOs. Oh February 2, 1973, Captain Peter Telling was flying a Grand Commander: aircraft at 10,000 feet over the Ohura Beacon area, about 157 degrees radial from the beacon, when he thought he had a fire in the starboard engine. Fearing a disaster, he looked very carefully to assess what was hap- pening. He saw, about 30 yards away, a ball of intense bluish- white light (\"much like a welding arc\") that was 20 to 40 feet in diameter. The object or phenomenon stayed with his air- craft for about 20-25 seconds. During this period, the ADF (Automatic Direction Finding) compass, and both the gyroscopic and magnetic compasses, went haywire and spun at a speed of about 12 rpms. All directional equipment remained non- functional until he passed over the Wanganui area. Telling also conducts a radio show, and con- tacted Vic Harris to discuss the sighting when Harris was a guest on a talk show. Harris told MUFON that the area of the sighting is known by pilots for its unusual effects on aircraft directional equipment. Similar, reports in the same area are-known to him, but the wit- nesses are reluctant to talk about their experiences. .,"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"UFO Spotted By School Children In R OIT! di n i 3 Submitted by Joe Brill At 9:15 hours, March 29, 1976, ten .children from SCAIENI town followed a impressive aerial phenomenon, for approcimately on hour. Fifteen-year-old COTOVANU GHEORGHE schoolboy declared the following: While walking with my schoolmates from school to home I saw some strange lights on the hill frontal us. The phenomenon I observed it in the West part and took place on a large area. At first sight I thought that they are the head-lights of a truck but the lights were too large for that distance and they were very near (side by side) and a small distan- ce of the top of the hill (altitude 500m) about 50 m. They were orange and made no noise. The lights moved simultaneously - declared the schoolboy DUMA GHEORGHE fourteen-year-old - then they disappeared and appeared at a great distance. Sometimes ap- peared only one and of red colour. This moved back to its original position and disappeared. Then reappeared two orange-colour lights indentical with the first. This playing of disappearances and changing og colours lasted about 15 minutes. They moved very fast surpassing the speed of a truck or tractor. By holding various coins at arm's length the witness guessed the UFO's ap- parent size was as large as a pea. Suddenly after many movements to the left or to the right from initial position the lights enlarged increasingly that they converted into a great luminous sphereilike the sun at noon. Then after some irregular movements is disap- peared for few minutes and reap- peared but less shining. The wit- nesses estimated its size to be as . large as a 1.5 cm disc held at arm's length. Distance about one kilometer (0.624). Elevation 30 degrees. Fourteen-year-old schoolgirl CORJOS RODICA gave full details of this movements: Before it reappear, appeared some very strong rays at the back of the hill and after a little time appeared a bright yellow-orange object, after a short stationary it disappeared and five minutes later appeared again. Then it changed his colour in,red and it disappeared and five minutes later it reappeared in other place. When it appeared and disap- peared it revolved over the. hill (like in a circle) lover down so I lost its sight. I thought it descen- ded. The schoolgirl KISS MINODORA fourteen-year-old described this movement in circle in a different manner. .The red light moved to North, where it became oval in shape. It was red at an extremity and orange to the other. Then it descended at the back of the hill and it reappear two minutes later in the same place having the same form (round) and colour (red) and moved to South. At the same time it rotated becoming oval in shape but the colours was placed inerse in comparison with the first case. When it became round and disap- peared at about 19.30 and reap- peared at about 19AQ. Prior to make one's appearance^ ap- peared some very strong rays then it repeated the same movements described above but more fast and in zigzag. When it became oval in shape \"it don't disappeared that in the first case at the back of the'hiilbut it moved to South, becoming this time small and red in color. In succession fourteen-year-old MORARU CONSTANTA schoolgirl, annex: Soon after that appeared two small orange-red lights; The first time they stationed then they disappeared after one second and they reap- peared in other place. Once again they became one and formed that bright light which was at the back of the hill. Then it disappeared and appeared again those two small lights which descended in zig-zag to the foot of the hill, where they stationed few seconds and then disappeared. Five minutes later appeared only one small light over the woods. There it stationed until I left to home. ! The end of this phenomenon is in the declaration of the schoolgirl â€” (11-year-old): \"In the evening of 29-03-76, in the West direction I observed over the hill near the Teleajen river, a light like a head-light car at a distance. It changed -the position every moment. The first time it was over the hill, then it appeared to the left and then it .descended to the ground near Teleajen river.

The palm smart him and head aches. After questioning the children, who seemed sincere and very cooperative, ,1 visted the area where the object were seen and found a round track of burnt grass about 150 cm wide (5 feet). Dead grass in the field been burnt and revealed the green grass being also with the tops withered or burnt. The burnt grass had a repulsive and stunning odour. The ''landing area\" is situated on the second rung of the hill and at 80 m (267 feet) distance a high line of ten- sion. . The possibility of lowering of the tension voltage at those moment could not prove it. I ef- fected some experiences which convinced me to believe the strange mark is radioactive! Thus I put on grass films isolate for 45 minutes. The films were strongly affected. Weather condition during the sighting were the following: clear sky, no precipitation, twilight, no wind, temperature approximately 10degrees C. No sound was heard during the whole sighting, nor was there any visible means of propulsion. In this place the ground is sloping (see sketch). The burning it's only on the surface and super- ficial and with a clear form. There was no indication that mark were made by ordinary-means. I think this clear mark (caused probable by UFO's standing at a small distance of the ground) maybe rather to result from a \"hot jet\" emited at \"take-off\" by UFO which at last disappearance left a smoke trail. 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"New French Abduction Case Translated by Rex Mibane (from Nostradamus No. 230) In the Valence region, Helene Giuliana's statements have around numerous reactions, one more passionate'than the other. Even the most skeptical are obliged to admit the evidence that, on the night of June 10-11, 1976, something extraordinary happened on route RN 539, a few kilometers from Romans, on the \"Martinet Bridge.\" Helene Giuliana is a young girl of 20 who lives with her farmer parents at Hostun, in the Drome. Her hair cut in boy fashion, with finely- featured face, Helene is considered by all the people who know\" her as ah intelligent and well-balanced girl. She is employed in the household of the mayor of the village, M. Bouvier, who has only good things to say about her. Awake to the problems of her time, she is no addict of films or science-fiction stories. She prefers to go dancing on Saturday evenings, like all those of her age, and to lead the sometimes careless life of 20- year-old girls. Nevertheless, Helene has had an adventure that few human beings have as yet undergone: she has been inside a flying saucer. .';' On June 10th, in company with a .girl-friend and, two masculine friends, Helene drove to Valence in her white \"4L\" car. She often goes to the movies during the week. This Thursday, the young people went to see \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.\" Afterwards, from midnight-till\" 1. AM, Helene drank a \"glass with her /friends at Romans, then returned home to Hostun,; 17 kilometers away.. : ,She usually takes about 20 minutes to make 14 this trip, which is joined by numerous local roads. 6 km from Romanus, the road runs along the left bank of the Isere and crosses a bridge called the bridge of Mar- tinet. Here, suddenly, her car's engine failed. \"I thought at first I was out of. gas,\" explains Helene, \"but then I remembered I had filled up before going to the movie. The idea of a mechanical breakdown did not occur to me, as my car has always run without trouble.\" Whatever the reason, after a few meters, the car stopped and the headlights went out. Then a terrifying phenomenon appeared. \"25 meters away\", says Helene, \"above the bridge, I saw a red- orange dome- shaped light. I don't know why, but I immediately thought of death. Then I put my hands oyer my eyes.\" After a few moments,. Miss G. looked again: the light had disappeared. Distracted she started up again to drive home. She was so frightened that she missed a turning that she had been familiar with for years, and had to drive 2 , km more .than necessary. When she reached home, she rushed in- to the bedroom of her sister, who woke with a start. \"What's the matter with you, Helene?\" she asked. \"Look at the time: 4 AM!\" Helene was stupefield. It was .im- possible, it couldn't be 4 o'clock! She. had left her friends at Romans only half an hour ago. this was the mystery that everyone would speculate about: what had Helene done during those two full hours, which she could not even remember? The next day she told he adventure to her parents, then to her employer. The story quickly became known in the . region,. and M, Andre Revol of St. Marcelli, an in- vestigator for the \"Ouranos\" committee, got in touch with her. He proposed a hypnotic session\" with M. Stephane Dey, living in Grenoble, who has already \"worked\" in Canada and the U.S.A. After much reluctance, Helene finally accepted: after all, she wanted to know! And on July 22, at St. Marcellin, the experiment took place. Helene said astonishing things. When M. Revol repeated her own words to her, after she had been awakened, she was unwilling to believe it. On August 18th, the experi- ment was repeated, in the presence of a TV team from station FR 3 of Lyon, M. Chaloin, one of the pionees of Ufology, M. Pierre D., a Ph.D. in nuclear physics, and MM. Gerard Moulinet arid Jean Louis Ruchon, two local journalists from Le Dauphihe Libore, as well as MM. 'Revol and Dey. For 40 minutes Helene repeated word for word that she had said the first time; she never contradicted herself. MM. Dey and Ruchon questioned her. \"I see a light,\" said the girl. \"My eyes hurt. I see two dwarfs who come closer and"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"open the left-hand door. They carry me toward the light. I turn around and my car has disappeared. I enter the UFO through an iron door. The dwarfs come to my waist. They are dressed in a dark- colored black-coverall. They have big eyes. They are sickly-looking.\" At this point M. Dey gave her a pen and a sheet of paper, and Helene slowly began to draw what she was seeing in her unconscious. Then she went on: \"The room is high and round in shape. Everything is made of iron. I am afraid. They law me on a sort of table and put some kind of handcuffs on my feet and hands! They also put a sort of napkin on my forehead. In the room there are white, red, and yellow lights... \"Suddenly one of the dwarfs traces circles on my sweater with a kind of box, resembling an electric light. Then I find myself ouside. The craft has 3 legs about 3 meters long, and blinking lights underneath...\" \"Is it going to return?\" asked M. Ruchon. \"I don't know\", replied Helene. \"Not right away, anyway. There are too many people around me. Perhaps in six months.\" The experiment is ended. Helene wakes and asks for a glass of water. When she hears the tape recording, which was broadcast on Tues., Aug. 24 by FR3, she is unable to believe it. Nevertheless ... It is dif- ficult to believe that if the girl was lying she would have testified to the same thing twice. Yet there are disturb- ing circumstances. First of all, this loss of 2 hours: the car could not have remained in the middle of the road for so long a time without arous- ing the curiosity of some passing driver. The sweater is ow being ex- amined at the atomic-energy center at Grenoble, to see if detectable traces remain. Another hypnotic session will surely be tried in the near future,. this time in the presence of eminent specialists and scientists. At the present time, Helene has tried to resume her daily life as if nothing had hap- pened. The whole village is talking of this story, and, as always,. some men of bad will are beginning to doubt the girl's sincerity. True or false? One thing is certainly sure: something extraordinary must have happened that night. But what? Pascagoula Update By Dr. Ted Peters, MUFON State Director for Louisiana One of the most controversial aspects of the case of the Pascagoula, Mississippi, abduction of two fisher- men (Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker) on October 11, 1973 has been the lie detector test in his UFOs Ex- plained, Philip Klass suggests that the report is a hoax. He bases this con- clusion primarily upon the suspicious circumstances surrounding the polygraph test administered to â€¢ Charles Hickson on October 30 of that year. Because the polygraphist was uncertified, and because he was called in hastily to perform the test in. order to be ready for a TV ap- pearance on the Dick Cavett show, Klass submits that the test was a whitewash. On October .19, 1976, I traveled with CBS newsman Bill Elder and a cameraman from WWL-TV New Orleans to interview Charles Hickson at the site of the alleged abduction in Pascagoula. Hickson recited the full account of his encounter on video- tape which was then edited an'd played on New Orleans television. After I told Bill Elder of'the con- troversy regarding the polygraph, we decided to subject the full interview to an examination by a Truth Analysis Psychological Stress Evaluator. We did so. Hickson passed the test. 1976MUFON SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS I84 pages) \"Swamp Gas Plus Ten - And Counting\" by'Dr. J.

Some highly-speculative material is found in the January issue of ANCIENT ASTRONAUTS. Granted, the problems of finding suitable material for a publication of this sort must be difficult, but that seems insufficient reason for publishing an article suggesting 16 that \"swine flu\" is a malady from outer space .(as an example of AA's contents). This sort of material is offset to some extent by an excellent roundup of Mars photos from the Viking probes. These show some of the enigmas of.Mars which might indicate for- mer civilizations on that planet. , . Bradley Ayers'story of his UFO sighting makes interesting reading in the January issue of PSYCHIC WORLD. Un- fortunately, he turns it into a \"pit- ch\" for the Center for UFO Studies before the article ends. Sighting reports alone are far more interesting. An interesting new periodical devoted to \"out-of-place ar- chaeology\" is called THE OOPARCHIST. It examines evidences of highly-advanced for- mer civilizations and reflects a Fundamentalist Christian point of view. It is published monthly, at $15.00 per year, and is available from Dr. J.R.

His new paper- back is PROJECT BLUE BOOK: Tee Top Secret UFO Findings Revealed (Ballantine; $1.95). This is apparently a hastily- compiled collection of material from the Project Blue Book files which were recently released to the National Archives. We hope to present more complete reviews of both books in later columns. A fascinating new book by George H. Leonard is entitled SOMEBODY ELSE IS ON THE MOON. Leonard lias examinee! a great number of lunar photos from Lunar Orbiter and Apollo cameras in his search -for eviden- ce of extraterrestrial activity on the Moon. He claims.to have been aided in his, search by a pseudonymous ex-NASA^scientist. The book's theme hinges oh the NASA photo which it contains. For myself, I,do not always see what Leonard sees (or \"sees\"), in the photos, but I suspect this may be due â€” in part â€” to the photo- reproduction methods used in the book. One should really examine prints of the original photos before coming to any conclusions and Leonard gives information on the procedures for ordering prin- ts. It is possible to see something at the points indicated by the author, but interpretations ', are another matter. Leonard believes that vast mining ,(and perhaps other) operations are being con- ducted on the Moon, largely on,the far side. In this respect, his research is a continuation of the theories set forth by the late M.K. Jessup in his classic, books, notably THE EXPANDING CASE FOR THE UFO. The historical record shows that, on hundreds of occasions, observers haveseenall manner of anomalies on the Moon, so the concept of in- telligence(s) there should not be lightly . dismissed. Even, if Leonard has been a bit overly- enthusiastic in some of his sup- positions, his book deserves a wide reading. In addition to the many NASA photos, numerous drawings of lunar features are in- cluded. I recommend this book to all people with open minds and critical eyes.

It should be noted, however, that his memory regarding what took place between his approaching the light source and finding him- self back in his sentry-box was almost a total blank for years af- terwards. He believes there was a deliberate attempt to erase these events from his mind, but not withstanding this, recollection gradually returned, though it was not until incidents occured many years later that his memory was triggered. Mr. Lancashire wrote to Lionel Beer, having noted his address from a letter in the Sun- day Mirror at the time the 'Betty and Barney Hill' story was featured. This letter was passed to me and on in turn to COS-MOS investigators Eric Richards and Sean Ainscough, both of whom were strongly impressed and believe this to be a 'true bill'. The following story is the result of .their enquiries. It was late summer 1942: Albert Lancashire was on guard duty at a radar site two miles from Newbiggin-on-Sea on the Nor- thumberland coast. It was a dark night and Mr. Lancashire stood in front of a sentry-box about 30 yar- ds from the sea. Suddenly a light shone from the sky about 300 feet above and away from him over the sea; it was surrounded by a 'black cloud' and his immediate thought was 'What have the Ger- mans invented now?' He went quickly into his box to try to see the object without being seen. The light, which was of a yellow colour 'rolled back on itself rather than being switched off, its position then being much lower with the object close to him but still over the water. Suddenly, Mr. Lan- cashire felt impelled to eo outside, and another light shone out-a yard of so in front of him a little above his hear. Startled, he threw up him arms and felt himself drawn towards it. As he walked 'along the beam' he was seized by pygmy-sized men and carried aboard a spacecraft the other members of whose crew were of our own height, the 'captain' having dark hair and wearing 'goggles'. Mrs. Lancashire was made to lie down on a couch or table looking upwards at the blue- domed ceiling of the craft. He could see a man leaning over another long table-like con- struction wearing a scull cap like a surgeons; this man too, wore very thick glasses or goggles and smiles as though in welcome. He is sure a medical examination of some kind took place, but still cannot remember details, although he believes a persistent tongue rash over the years may have an association. He next recalls being back in his sentry- box. We now have a rather remarkable gap of 25 years during which time, beyond a few 'lights in the sky' sightings, little of note 'saucerwise' happened to Mr. Lancashire. Then, during Oc- tober 1967, he experienced a series of incidents, some of which could well have a psychic origin, which were in part responsible for triggering off his memory con- cerning the details of his 1942 con- tract. The first occured whilst he lay on his bed one evening smoking. He noticed a small pin- point of light over the bedroom door; this grew in intensity and sixe until it became as large as a .grapefruit and changed into a human head: it was tilted slightly upwards and was not directly facing him. Although the head it- self remained immobile the eyes continually moved from side to side. The face had high cheek- bones; the hair was black with jus.t a trace of beard around the face. After a few minutes the image gradually faded and disap- peared. Shortly after this he was on duty in his signal-box at night, (he is \"a signal-man with British Rail), when he saw and felt what he could only say was a 'presence'. This took the form of a bright light which appeared a few feet from him: it was so bright in fact he could scarcely bear to look at it. Inside the light he could see the head and shoulders of a man ap- pearing exactly as though chiselled out of white marble, theonly detail visible being a black line across the top of the head. This faded and disappeared after a couple of minutes followed by the light. Still in the same month, and again on duty in his signal-box at night, he saw a dark object in the sky surrounded by little red lights blinking off and on only a few hun- dred yards away. As it drew level with the box he waved his arm. The object stopped, the red lights went out and in their place was visable a dome-shaped light; the object then moved off at terrific speed. Yet a third time under the same circumstances, he observed a green light out of the corner of his eye; he turned his head and found part of one wall of the signal-box to be glowing green without any accountable reason or visable source for the light. This too, gradually faded. In the December of the following year - 1968, the signalman in the box next down the line phoned through to tell him of a bright white object the size of a full moon hovering near a large mill chimney - a prominent local landmark. Mr. Lancashire saw it ilso and they both noticed it was revolving below the top of the chimney, sometimes appearing ciruclar, sometimes cross--"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"shaped. After a few minutes it sped off at terrific speed, starting its journey with a large \"W\" movement, then shooting away in a straight line. A number of other incidents have occured to Mr. Lancashire during recent years, mainly of a psychic nature, some possibly with a bearing on his original con- tact. Lake of space, un- fortunately, precludes further reference to them at present, but we hope to return to Mr. Lan- cashire in future issues. Suffice it for the present to quote from the reports of the investigatory in- volved. ERIC RICHAR DS:\"....my opinion of Mr. Lan- cashire is that he is by no means a crank: he is absolutely sincere and clearly believes all he has told me. He is in himself definitely sure they had him in that UFO in 1942 and did something to him. I would say he is above average in- telligence... it is my opinion he has had genuine experiences. SEAN AINSCOUGH: .....I draw attention to page 32 of Sept/Oct. '69 FSR Physical Examination by Minature Mar- tians' by Gordon Greighton. Several aspects are identical with Mr. L's account of his experience: 1. Blinded at first instant of con- tact by beam of light. 2. Creatures of indentical proportion rendered him powerless and conveyes him to themachine. - 3. L's conviction that something was inserted in his mouth as in the case of the Brazilian contac. Mr. L. showed Eric Richards and myself a scar on his tongue which he is convinced resulted from this examination. 4. Finally and most significant tly, in both cases influence was brought to bear on the subject to ensure that the total experience after-wards would seem to been 'like a dream'. STATEMENT 1.

Speakers already committed are Stan- ton T. Friedman, Nuclear Physicist and UFO Lecturer; James M. McCampbell, MUFON Director for Research; Thomas M. Gates. Planetarium Direc- tor and avid UFOlogist; J.F. \"Ben\" Herr, Precision Monitoring Systems of San Diego; and William H. Spaulding. On Sunday, July 17th, Bill will present an all new 2- hour photographic lecture with movies. Very reasonable summer group rates at the SAFARI have already been arranged, which are more economical than at previous sym- posiums. This is Scottsdale's largest and most complete convention center for sales meetings, seminars, conferences and banquets. Plan your summer vacation around this outstanding event. This will be the first MUFON sponsored symposium to be held in our Western Regional District of the United States. The success of the slide/tape lecture produced two years ago by Elmer A. Krai and associates in Nebraska for MUFON has prompted an updated ver- sion that will be released early in 1977. It will be titled \"UFO Reports: A Problem for Science\" with appropriate credits to people from coast to coast who have been so generous to help in this ambitious project. Details for utilization of this slide/tape lecture and it's availability from MUFON will be announced in a future issue of THE MUFON UFO JOURNAL. Bill Pitts, State Director for Arkan- sas, has appointed Sandra M. Bridges, Route 3, Box 23, Elaine, Ark. 72333 as State Section Director for Phillips County. Richard H. Hall, International Coordinator, has arranged for Mike H. Viljoen, P.O. Box 743, Durban, South Africa 4000 to become MUFON's Representative for South Africa replacing Carl Van Vlierden. Mike is a Biochemist with a B.S. in both Chemistry and Microbiology. As some of you may have noted in recent correspondence with MUFON's ad- ministrative office, Mrs. Diane Slaughter is our new office secretary. Her husband, Bill, is the former Editor of the Seguin Enterprise newspaper and now teaches Journalism at Judson High School in Converse, Texas. October 1976 marked the 20th An- niversary of NICAP. The October issue of the UFO INVESTIGATOR com- memorated this event with a historical recap of NICAP's accomplishments and problems. Many of the fine people that originally were instrumental in building NICAP have now become an integral part of MUFON, serving on the Board of Directors, as Consultants, State Directors, State Section Directors, etc. We extend our best wishes to John Acuff on this memorable occasion. A few people have questioned whether Dennis Hauck, the Editor of THE MUFON UFO JOURNAL, may be faced with a \"conflict of interest\", since his recent employment as the Editor of OFFICIAL UFO. He has belayed any such apprehension by his statement in the August issue of the JOURNAL. The MUFON Board of Directors has the ut- most faith that Mr. Hauck will not allow his allegiance to the two non-associated publications become detrimental to either. Before we are besieged with com- plaints, the typesetting on the lead ar- ticle in the August issue of the JOUR- NAL titled \"The Sedona, Arizona Photograph and Evaluation\" by W.H. Spaulding was inundated with errorsâ€”entirely unacceptable for a publication of this caliber. In contrast, the photographic analysis by GSW per- sonnel was superb in their techniques. The International Data Exchange Program, initiated by Richard H. Hall, whereby six MUFON Information Cen- ters throughout the World, are reproducing and distributing UFO material submitted to them is a giant step forward in communicating this phenomenon to representatives in each Nation. A cautionary step is advisable, however. We must not become so zealous in forwarding material to these information centers, that we fail to send the same information to MUFON in Seguin, Texas for distribution to THE MUFON UFO JOURNAL, and in- terested Consultants. Newspaper clip- pings, in particular, should be shared with Rod B. Dyke's U.F.O. Newsclip- ping Service, 4540 - 8th Ave. N.E. Suite 404, Seattle, Washington 98105. To obtain proper distribution of this material to the pertinent personnel will require reproduction facilities. MUFON has invested in a copying machine that will fulfill this need. To make Mr. Hall's program effective, MUFON will reproduce and mail material to the respective centers if you do not have reproduction equipment available. (Please so advise in your attached correspondence.) It is imperative that the MUFON administrative office has access to all material of this nature, otherwise we will cease to be effective in sharing UFO information with our members and subscribers via THE MUFON UFO JOURNAL. The Travis Walton abduction case has been thoroughly covered from the December 1975 issue of SKYLOOK through the August 1976 edition of THE MUFON UFO JOURNAL providing both affirmative and negative conclusions. When new facts become available in this case, JOURNAL readers will be the first to read them. In the meantime, we should devote our at- tention to current UFO research and not be concerned about who is or isn't going to take the next polygraph test. Despite his poor \"track record\" on previous cases, Philip (Class has done a very thorough and comprehensive study of the Travis Walton case disclosing in- formation that may point out that this was a contrived hoax. The true facts will unveil themselves in the future. 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"INTERNATIONAL ROUND-UP by Richard Hall. MUFON International Coordinator (These brief reports and news items ore gleaned from foreign publications whose exchange copies have been received by MUFON, from foreign newspaper stories, and letters from MUFON Representatives overseas). SOBERS (Boulevard Aristide Briand 26; 1070 Bruxelles, Belgium) has begun publication of English-language extracts from the French-language In- forespace, under the title SOBEPS News. Issues 1 & 2, for January and March 1976, respec- tively, have been received by MUFON. SOBEPS was founded on May 20, 1971 and Inforespace was first published in January 1972. In addition to case reports and analyses, SOBEPS Newsfll con- tains a discussion of the UFO problem by Auguste Meessen, Professor of Theoretical Physics at Louvain's Catholic University. The article, titled \"Research Hypotheses and Strategies,\" states that the extraterrestrial origin of UFOs, while not his \"belief\", is the \"most plausible hypothesis\" and provides a realistic research strategy for at- tacking the UFO problem. Issue#2 discusses the Bermuda Triangle, with related book reviews; a study of physiological effect cases; and other reports.

Two truck drivers were paced by a UFO from Nive Hill to Berriedale, a distance of over 90 km, starting about 3:30 AM. The object, at first stationary, had a brilliant yellow-white dome in the center; a dark colored body was partly concealed by the brilliant light. One of the men tried to use his radio, but it was drowned out by static. They stopped the truck, and watched the UFO cross the road ahead of them. .When they started up again, the object resumed pacing them. It finally disappeared climbing slowly higher in the sky around 6 AM. (Credit: Paul Jackson, Tasmanian UFO Investigation Centre). 11/1/75; Northmead, N.S.W., Australia. At 2:25 AM a couple woke up to the sound of a strong wind and dogs barking. Looking out the window, they saw a red circular object estimated to be 8- 10 meters in diameter and about 30 m away, near trees. The trees were swaying violently, and the whole neighborhood was lit up with the red glow from the object. When the object moved away, it left a zig-zag smoke trail.

About 9 PM three persons saw, in the southeast at an elevation of about 40Â°, a dark cylindrical object flying on a straight course northeast. Its bot- tom portion appeared netlike, and from this part a light pulsating for about 3 minutes. (Credit: SUFOI Newsletter No. 1, 1976) 2/19/75; Western Zealand, Den- mark. At 11:15 AM a zeppelin-like silvery-white object, changing in shape to oval, was seen at an elevation of about 45Â°. It disap- peared from view, then reap- peared above a neighbor's house, appearing to be as large as the house. It hovered there for 4-5 minutes, swaying around its cen- ter and changing altitude oc- casionally. At this point the UFO resembled an open umbrella. The center of its base was blindingly bright, and around the rim were pulsating points of light. From these points, \"spasms or jerks\" (pulses?â€”Editor) moved toward the center. No sound was heard. The weather was clear and bright, and the ob- ject remained in view 5-6 minutes. (Credit: SUFOI Newsletter No. 1, 1976. [Mark R.
