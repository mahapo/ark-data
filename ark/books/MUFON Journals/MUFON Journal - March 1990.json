FROM THE EDITOR Changes, as you may have noticed, are afoot in the Journal's format and ap- pearance. It's probably not too far off the mark to say that human nature, in general, resists change on principle, so I expect to receive a few complaints. I should add, however, that the changes are not for changes' sake, i.e., idle tinkering, but are designed to make the Journal more readable, that is, more useful to you, our members and subscribers. A less dense page of text is less work for the eye of the reader. Regular departments will eventually be iden- tified so that they become readily recognizable and easier to find. Other minor design elements will be added as time goes along. And no doubt a mistake, or kink or two, will be made along the way which will have to be worked out later. In the meantime, we ask your patience. We hope you like our new ap- pearance, and we look forward to hearing from you. IN THIS ISSUE MEN IN BLACK  Peter M.

A previous contributor to the MUFON Journal, his Ph.D. dissertation ('The Boun- daries of Orthodoxy: A Folkloric Look at the UFO Phenomenon\") ex- plored UFOs in the context of the full range of human encounters with spiritual entities. We welcome Mr. Rojcewicz back to our pages with this article, reprinted with the per- mission of the author and ReVision: The Journal of Consciousness and Change, where it originally ap- peared. Subscriptions to the latter (4 issues/$18) are available from Heldref Publications, 4000 Albemar- le St., NW, Washington, DC, 20016. M ost folklorists shy away from serious consider- ation of the truth of re- ported anomalous ex- periences, fearing that the question- able nature of the experiences casts an unprofessional light on their work and because the question of the ob- jective basis underlying anomalous beliefs is not considered by many to be folklore concern. Such a position is indefensible because as folklorists and humanists we have to be con- cerned with explanation in general. Folkloristic interest in UFOs began with a 1950 Hoosier Folklore (Peck- ham 1950) article. Not until the 1970s, however, did folklore's prevailing at- titude toward UFOs crystalize (Degh 1971). Simply stated, although we should study UFOs and related anom- alous phenomena in terms of trans- mission, motif, and distribution, the in- vestigation of truth-claims is not a func- tion appropriate to a folklorist (Degh By Peter M. Rojcewicz, Ph.D. 1977; Ward 1977; Bullard 1982). The prevailing position insists that we see anomalous beliefs as products of cul- tural expectations (Honko 1965; Lowe 1979) and human needs (Evans 1987). This well-established position is in- defensible. Explanation has always been a fundamental function of folk- lore, and we must be prepared to go where we must to find it. It is time to stop insisting that we look at anomalous phenomena only as rep- resentational or symbolic, thus ex- cluding consideration of naturalistic and supernatural explanations. 1 We owe our primary allegiance to the identification, classification, and analysis of the subject matter and not to the conventional parameters of our discipline. To insist that folklorists should consider only certain kinds of explanations and exclude others is ar- bitrary and confining. The problem is that the majority of folklorists and anthropologists, as well as behavioral scientists, pursue their disciplines with unconsciously held dogmas concerning what can or can- not be true. These unconscious dog- mas and assumptions, which make ordinary scientific practice possible, constitute what Thomas Kuhn ([1962] 1970) calls a \"paradigm.\" 1 think it is fair to say that modern science is almost entirely governed by the paradigm of scientific materialism. Now, to the extent that modern folklore studies are governed by this overarching paradigm, it is no surprise that the objective basis of anomalous beliefs if never addressed; as Kuhn pointed out, it is precisely anomalies that challenge the normal paradigm of any given science. Consider, for example, stories of miraculous healings. The modern folklorist is apt to say that people believe in the miraculous power of saints because they are overwhelmed by anxiety and helplessness; at any rate, he or she is probably well stocked with a priori arguments, designed to explain away claims of miraculous cure. However, the truth is that medically attested claims for anomalous healings in a religious set- ting indubitably exist (Thurston 1952; Rogo 1982; Thompson 1987; Mur- phy 1987). This complicates matters for the folklorist operating faithfully within the parameters of the mainline paradigm. In my view, there is a considerable body of data that, taken en masse, has unsettling implications for students of folklore, religion, and an- thropology. This problem was already seen by folklorist Andrew Lang 2 dur- ing the Victorian age when British psychical research was first getting under way (Dorson 1968, 212-16) and again more recently by David J. Hufford (1982a) in his investigations of the Old Hag. Indeed, one might say an underground tradition of folklorists (those who take anomalous claims seriously) has been active since the days of Sir James Frazer (a pro- totype of modern folklorists who automatically dismiss such claims as \"impossible\"). Generally speaking, these puzzling phenomena raise questions about the adequacy of the existing paradigm. Indeed, the data in question may even present exciting possibilities for revising the dominant model. The data in question have revolutionary implications not only for folklore but for all the behavioral and social sciences. My own investigations into the phenomena and folklore surrounding MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 263 March 1990"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the so-called Men in Black (MIB) have continually forced me to confront od- dities and anomalies not easily en- compassed by the established para- digm. My purpose here is to explore, in a tentative vein, my misgivings about the prevailing model, particular- ly with regard to Men in Black. Now, in other areas of folklore, scholars include the objective mater- ial aspects of their subject in their research equation. Folklorists inter- view singers and instrumentalists about what it is like to make music, about what constitutes good and bad music, and about standards of com- petence in the performance of music. No folklorist would argue that you can do an adequate job merely by talk- ing about music and not describing, notating, and recording it. Similarly, students of material culture not only look at or talk about barns and houses, they also accurately measure them, carefully noting relationships among the constituent parts and the whole. Those of us who study folk food- ways are not only interested in collect- ing recipes; we are also interested in the particular plants and vegetables called for by the recipes, as well as the garden that produces those products. In addition, we observe and compare different cultural methods of the use of those foods. Finally, we eat the pro- ducts of these recipes and find them delicious or wanting. In all areas of folklore, we concern ourselves with observations of real things (Hufford 1977, 1983, 1985, 1988). We ob- serve, compare, and analyze our sub- ject matter in order to further our knowledge. Anomalous Beliefs Folklorists interested in anomalous beliefs are likewise concerned with knowledge, and they have the same duty to investigate the objective aspects of their subject matter. Everyone in folklore knows about those kinds of truth questions, and folklorists studying belief materials are simply doing the same thing in pur- The problem is that the majority of folklorists and an- thropologists, as well as behavioral scientists, pursue their disciplines with unconsciously held dogmas concerning what can or cannot be true. suit of other kinds of knowledge. 3 Recently Bruce Jackson (1988, 276-92) has rightly raised important questions about authenticity and truth in ethnographic interpretation and news reporting. Finally, folklorists should inquire into the reality claims of anomalous beliefs because they are extremely interesting and profoundly important. The mere fact that anomalous beliefs are held by a majority of the world's people in con- tradiction to the attitudes of the ma- jority of academics studying them makes them worthy of study. Admit- tedly, it is difficult to give cases where the dominant reductionist position re- jected a priori the reality claims of anomalous beliefs that proved in the end to be true. But we can be greatly encouraged by recent studies of the stigmata (Thurston 1952, 32-129), out-of-body travel (Grosso 1975), near-death experiences (Moody 1976, Ring 1984), and the classical Nightmare (Hufford 1982a). Several scholars have argued that people believe they have had anom- alous experiences because their psychology or culture supports and encourages such beliefs (Scorneaux 1984, 3-6; Rogerson 1984, 10-13), yet there is growing evidence indi- cating that some anomalous beliefs are products of accurate observations analyzed reasonably. Thomas E. Bui- lard has recently moved away from his strict reliance upon the prevailing folkloristic paradigm (1982, 1). Not- ing that David J. Hufford's study of the Old Hag indicates that witnesses can offer accurate descriptions of their experiences even when cultural ex- pectations color the account, Bullard (1988, 11) states that \"the critic must allow abductees and other UFO wit- nesses the same capability\" because \"any complete account of the abduc- tion phenomenon must also reckon with these indications of reality.\" It is our business and our tradition as folklorists and humanists to inquire after the reality of anomalous truth- claims. Roger D. Abrahams (1986, 65) eloquently describes our professional enterprise: \"To some degree, all ob- servers of human behavior seek a cor- ner on the market of reality, for it is our [emphasis his] profession, our [emphasis his] way of managing our own destinies. The project of all the humanistic disciplines has been to discriminate between the real and the unreal, the genuine and the fake, the realistic and the sentimental or fan- tastic, the verifiable truth (all those things we call the 'facts') and illusions, the misleading, the mystified, and the mythical.\" Yates Encounter Folklore studies of UFO belief materials have failed to appreciate the interrelatedness of UFOs with num- erous belief traditions. This failing is clearly demonstrated with belief in the Men in Black. The MIB experience is a cryptic part of the UFO phenome- non that consists of a continuum of related but discrete events. The overall UFO framework provides a useful means of reorganizing the contexts of folk traditions into more contempor- ary ones without negating either the traditional elements or their important phenomenological differences. The Robert Yates MIB experience is similar in many respects to the ex- periences of other people. In fact, similar encounters have been reported so often that we can rightfully speak of the MIB experience as a discrete category of encounter experience with a stable structure of phenomenology. While mention of MIB encounters is most often found in the literature of UFOs (Rojcewicz 1984), they can MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 263 March 1990"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"also be found in accounts of ghosts (Royal and Girvan [1976] 1986, 8-10), devils (Scot [1584] 1972, 86), werewolves (Summers 1973, 232-4), bedroom apparitions (Keel 1970, 188-94), manifestations of the Virgin Mary (Evans 1984, 136-7), and the mystical tradition of the \"Brothers of the Shadow\" (Blavatsky [1877] 1972, I, 319). The term Men in Black originated from the 1952 encounter of Albert K. Bender (1962). Robert The MIB experience is a cryptic part of the UFO phenomenon that consists of a continuum of related but discrete events. Yates himself never had a UFO ex- perience. His MIB encounter seems to have occurred because he transcribed several audiotapes of MIB narratives for a Philadelphia UFO In- vestigator and therefore was guilty as if by UFO association. On the evening of 9 March 1983, an unknown man dressed in black at- tempted to purchase books costing approximately forty-five dollars from a Philadelphia bookstore while Robert Yates was the cashier on duty. The Man in Black stood five feet eleven inches tall and weighed in excess of two hundred pounds. Because the man did not have pro- per identification, Yates refused to honor his personal check. To establish his credibility, the man left an envelope on the counter containing various per- sonal papers that included job infor- mation, personal philosophy, and photocopies of identification cards in- dicating membership in several organizations. Also included was a copy of a photo of the man taken by a studio in Ridgewood, New Jersey. When Yates refused to accept the check, or even glance at the envelope, the man, clearly annoyed, declared that he would have to go to his car to get some money. After waiting for some time for the man's return, Yates went outside to survey the parking places near the store, but he saw no one. The man did not return until two nights later. Anti-Semitic On that evening, Yates was again working at the cash register. He was cursorily reading a book while main- taining a general awareness of what was happening in the store. The man's unverifiable appearance that night is characteristic of many MIB accounts. Yates described it this way: \"Sudden- ly he was just standing there! I looked over and he stood just to the right of the cash register. He would have had to pass me [from the left] to get into the store to be in that position. He was just suddenly standing there.\" As on the first encounter, the Man in Black tried to pay for his books by check, again using a photocopy of a defaced driver's license as identifica- tion. Again Yates refused to accept the check. The man shook with anger. \"You'd think this bookstore was run by Jews,\" he said. A male cus- tomer standing with a woman several feet away responded to the challenge: \"He is Jewish; so what?\" The MIB continued his disparaging remarks: \"It was Jewish people who brought mistrust into this country!\" Just as Yates began to advise the MIB to leave, the agitated customer yelled, \"He's leaving now,\" and forcibly re- moved the man from the store. Once at the door, the customer, tired of the man's crudity and resistance to leav- ing, struck him a solid blow to the face. Yates immediately called the Philadelphia police. The police arrived, and after Yates told them what had happened, they decided to escort the man outside for further questioning. Just outside the doorway, the Man in Black turned around and walked in a most peculiar manner back toward the middle of the store. Yates recalled the scene: \"The cops said, 'Hey, watcha doin'?' And he said, 'I've left my brief- case.' An officer said, 'You wait here. We'll get it.' So the two police officers went back in, and the other two waited outside the door. We walked MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 263 March 1990"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"around looking ... there was no brief- case anywhere. And when the cops walked back to tell the man they couldn't find the briefcase, the other two cops [at the door] said [pause], 'Well, he must have gone back into the store!' because they didn't see him — they didn't — he just suddenly, kind of [pause, sigh] wasn't there!\" Yates soon felt nauseated, light- headed, and weak, despite having had sufficient rest and dinner three hours earlier. The police exited quick- ly, leaving confusion behind them. The term \"Men in Black\" can be traced back to the 1952 encounter of Albert Bender, a Bridgeport, Connec- ticut, factory worker. Bender wrote to a friend saying that he had learned the origin and ultimate purpose be- hind \"flying saucers.\" Soon after mail- ing the letter, Bender was approached by three men dressed in black, one of whom inexplicably carried Bender's letter. The MIB informed Bender that he had indeed. stumbled upon the secret of the flying saucers, and they warned him that he should never reveal to anyone what he knew. Bender was frightened enough to discontinue his UFO activities. However, pressured by his friends, publisher, UFO researcher Gray Barker (1956) (who published his own account of the Bender incident), and gyroscope technician Dominic Lucchesi, Bender finally in 1962 published the story of his confronta- tion, entitled Flying Saucers and the Three Men. This version is so fantastic that even Barker and Lucchesi found it difficult to believe. 4 Black Cadillac In the prototypical narrative, MIB travel in threes by foot or car. When a car is involved, it is typically a black, early model Cadillac, usually in ex- cellent condition. When witnesses have had the presence of mind to record the license plate numbers, it is always the case that the plates have never been officially issued. Likewise, identification cards bearing the alleged names and organizational affiliations are always phony. Investigators have chased these cars, only to have them disappear impossibly around busy cor- ners or at dead-end streets (Keel [1970] 1976, 255). Similarly, vampires are known to make their retreat in black carriages (Blavatsky [1877] 1972, 1,454). Like vampires, MIB often wear black suits, a white shirt, and a black tie. Large brimmed hats are not unusual. These clothes are sometimes different from what most people are wearing during the current season of the year and are either impeccably neat or wrinkled and soiled (Rojcewicz 1987, 152). If not in suits, MIB wear black turtleneck shirts or sweaters, often with a dark woolen ski hat. Sometimes referred to as strong-arm agents, MIB resem- ble movie stereotypes of gangsters, in- ternational terrorists or spies. In ad- dition, MIB have been reported to be military intelligence personnel, a fact noted by the Pentagon (Fawcett and Greenwood 1984, 237). Men in Black often appear like cadavers with gaunt, withdrawn faces, high cheekbones, and deep-set eyes that compel the witness to stare into them. Vampire lore contains num- erous accounts of mysterious men in black who first paralyze their victims with a hypnotic stare and then drink their blood. The gypsies, famed for appearing strange and wild looking, possess the eyes of the \"fascinator, glittering and cold as that of a serpent\" (Leland [1891] 1971, 2). Pale or grayish skin gives the Men in Black a ghoulish air. These cadaver types are usually puppet-like. Not all MIB look like cadavers, however. They also can have an Oriental, Burmese, Italian, or an In- dian look. Some witnesses have in- sisted that the MIB were neither black nor white. When on occasion they have been shown pictures of various ethnic groups as models, witnesses often insisted that the Laplanders look the most like the individuals they met. As Clark notes, in addition to the so- called cadavers and the \"racially am- biguous crypto-Asian types,\" MIB also appear to be \"American or Spanish, or Portuguese, or French or Nor- wegian\" (Clark 1980, 288). There is some question as to the international distribution of the phenomenon. 5 The speaking style and walking mo- tion of Men in Black are always mem- orable. Witnesses are startled to hear a resonant eloquence, mechanical MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 263 March 1990"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"monotone (Schwarz 1983, II, 242), annoying sing-song, or whining sound. MIB sometimes display dif- ficulty breathing, wheezing and gasp- ing between words (Keel 1976, 57). When they appear in the mode of the \"tough guys,\" their speech is apt to be suggestive of the stilted phrasings and threatening cliches of conventional villains of crime and gangster films of the 1940s: \"Again, Mr. Stiff, I fear that you are not being honest!\" \"Mr. Veich, it would be unwise of you to mail that report\" (Evans 1984, 139). MIB walk as if their hips were swivel joints, pro- ducing a gliding or rocking effect, with the torso and legs moving off in op- posite directions. Some witnesses have stated that MIB walk as if intox- icated or otherwise disoriented. Intimidation The purpose of MIB visitations is intimidation, harassment, and inva- sion of privacy. Arriving at the homes or workplaces of witnesses to anom- alous events, Men in Black are known to warn witnesses and investigators that the open discussion of or con- tinued investigation into anomalous phenomena could be dangerous to themselves and their families. Dr. Herbert Hopkins, the physician who conducted hypnosis sessions with David Stephens after his UFO sighting, confronted a MIB in 1976. The MIB told Dr. Hopkins that unless he handed over the audiotapes of the Stephens hypnosis sessions, he might surfer the same fate as UFO abductee Barney Hill (Fuller 1966), who died because he \"knew too much about flying saucers.\" Despite the tough language and bullying tactics, no threat against a witness has been car- ried out, as far as we know. Men in Black have visited witnesses before they have communicated their anomalous experiences to anyone. If witnesses have secretly snapped photos or made audiotapes, the MIB demand and usually obtain those artifacts (Schwarz 1983, I, 242-44). UFO in- vestigators and their assistants who themselves have never seen a UFO have been nevertheless visited by MIB, as if guilty by investigation and associa- tion (Rojcewicz 1987). Witnesses are extremely frightened when MIB have revealed an impossible knowledge of personal details of their lives, and thus MIB can possess an omniscient air (Hynek and Vallee 1975, 141). Similarly, the Devil of tradition is described as a man in black or a black man (Scot [1584] 1972, 86). The Devil, who with his two lieutenants comprise the \"Trinity of Evil\" (Wall [1902] 1968, 27-8), knows \"all the secrets and mysteries of the natural world\" (Thomas 1971, 470). Else- where I have demonstrated the numer- ous analogues between the MIB and the Devil of tradition (Rojcewicz 1987). The prototypical Men in Black nar- rative is never fully realized in its com- plete form. For example, in a detailed study of thirty-two reliable cases, British researcher Hilary Evans (1984, 139) discovered considerable varia- tion from the norm. In four of the thirty-two cases, witnesses to anom- alous experiences did not receive a visit and were instead intimidated over the telephone. In five cases, the MIB traveled in groups of three, in two cases in groups of four, and in five cases in groups of two. In twenty of the total thirty-two cases, there was only one Man in Black. Evans also found variation from the norm with the famed phantom Cadillac. A car was mentioned in only nine cases. The car was a Cadillac in only three of these accounts, and only two of these were black, and only two (not the same two) were out-of-date models. These variations on the ideal MIB account point to a difference be- tween experience and tradition, and if those differences do not in them- selves prove that the witnesses are describing an actual event, they are nevertheless significant. Further Considerations The Robert Yates account is not a mere tale or story, which by defini- tion of genre does not require belief or disbelief in the ordinary sense of the word. Neither is it a legend, whose message is or was or, at least, can be believed (Degh 1981, 62). The Yates narrative is a personal ex- perience account told in the first per- son and constitutes what folklorists refer to as a \"memorate.\" The account has not circulated and therefore has not undergone the cultural changes common to oral transmission. There is always difficulty in gauging the degree of belief in an experience like that of Robert Yates. The problem of interpretation arises in part from the fact that belief is an ambiguous and imprecise analytical category (Hufford 1977a). Before we researchers affirm, condemn, or simply note the reality claims of anomalous beliefs, we need to be clear as to what actually is believed. There is no good reason to assume that people holding the same beliefs will necessarily express the same attitudes toward them. This is true not only from informant to infor- mant but also from the same infor- mant from one instance or situation to another (Goldstein 1964). Accounts of anomalous events often reveal a wide range of attitudes from, say, unequivocal certainty, to neutrality, to skepticism, to utter disbelief or debunking (Degh and Vazsonyi 1976; Bennett 1987, 213). Hypothetically, an individual may be utterly convinced that he or she has had an authentic UFO experience, have some belief that it was truly anomalous, feel unsure as to whether a controlling intelligence was involved, be skeptical that it was, say, a Soviet secret weapon, and absolutely certain it was not paranormal. There is no reason to assume outright that anomalies like MIB encounters, near- death experiences, shamanic voy- ages, and UFO abductions generate beliefs possessing a clearly deter- mined and fixed truth claim, because in fact they sometimes carry multiple meanings and constitute a fuzzy set of often contradictory mental attitudes (Sperba 1982). \"Flesh & Blood\" Robert Yates is absolutely sure that he encountered a man dressed in black in a Philadelphia bookstore. He MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 263 March 1990"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"8 asserts that his experience \"fits the descriptive pattern of UFOs\" as he knows it. He is convinced that the man was neither paranormal nor extrater- restrial. He maintains in a tentative way that the man was an \"earthly military man in a possession state.\" He is dis- turbed by the nonveridical appearance and disappearance of a man he is con- vinced was flesh and blood. To talk of a witness' belief as if it always carries a precise emotional and intellectual commitment is precarious to accuracy. Beliefs, like Robert Yates| often carry degrees of personal investment as well as several possible interpretations, any one of which can be held without full commitment. Many accounts of anomalous beliefs are presented as if assertions by wit- nesses carry the same degree of belief regardless of contextual factors. The researcher should expect some varia- tion in belief depending on whether the witness feels he or she is in the pre- sence of a sympathetic or antagonistic listener; whether a considerable period of time has elapsed since the original event; whether the witness has been exposed to potentially misleading post- event information; or whether the wit- ness has recently undergone a change of attitude that would induce a par- ticular bias in the recollection of details of the event (Hall, McFeathers, and Loftus 1987). Strange experiences do not nec- essarily assert complete or lasting belief. Accounts of Men in Black and UFOs may \"explore the nature of nature to discover what can be believed\" (Classic 1982, 62). Because no epistemological differentiation among beliefs is offered by most researchers, an informant's statements get fitted neatly together, and they thus display the appearance of a homogeneous commitment that is a product of the researcher and not of the informant. Crack Event Furthermore, it is difficult to interpret the Yates MIB encounter because it fuses two qualitatively different modes of reality. The Yates affair emerges at a crack in the axis dividing the world The prototypical Men in Black narrative is never fully realized in its com- plete form. of the everyday from the world of the apparently impossible. The crack event, neither entirely concrete nor entirely ephemeral, is an ontologically am- biguous experience whose nature ex- ists somewhere in between. The Yates report describes the MIB in naturalistic, flesh-and-blood terms. Initially, there is no obvious suggestion that this is a mystical or psychic event. From Yates' description, we can see that the MIB is relatively well integrated into his context, as is the situation in many other accounts (Evans 1984, 136-7). In addition, unlike in the case of other MIB narratives, I possess reasonably reliable information concer- ning the MIB's name, occupation, ap- pearance, group affiliations, telephone number, and post office boxes. He was seen by several witnesses. All those facts give the incident sufficient plausibility as a normal event. It would seem that what we have here is simp- ly a weird but quite ordinary experience involving an unruly bigot. This conclusion, however satisfying to some, can only be derived by selec- tively refusing to consider all the de- tails. For despite the appearance of an ordinary event, there are details in- dicating the prototypical MIB scenario. Let us discuss a few of these pro- vocative details. First, the incident in- volves a man, and although there are reports of Women in Black, they are extremely rare (Schwarz 1983, 1,247). Next, the man's untidy black pants and sports jacket are in accord with the usual MIB attire. The man was not one of the cadaver or \"crypto-Asian\" types discussed earlier, but his unshaven face did give him a darker air. His hairstyle was eccentric and matched the norm (Keel [1970] 1976, 77-8). According to Yates, the man's blackish gray hair was \"half sticking up all over the place; except it was. matted on the top as though he had been sleeping on it or wearing a hat.\" He walked strangely, a feature des- cribed by many MIB witnesses. Film actor and director John Sayles has noted this peculiar MIB feature in his film entitled The Brother from Another Planet (Sayles 1984). Yates reported the man's \"clumsy sort of lilt as though his body was a little dou- ble jointed all over\" and noted that \"his body seemed to juggle or jum- ble around.\" Yates found his movements to be \"unnatural,\" \"disorienting,\" and \"off- setting.\" Immediately upon the disap- pearance of the man, Yates felt \"nauseated, lightheaded, and weak,\" as have many other MIB witnesses. Vertigo and time distortion have also been reported. Some witnesses have suffered from effects associated with aeroembolism or \"caisson disease\" (popularly referred to as \"the bends\"), whose symptoms include pains in the joints, limbs, stomach, and head, as well as dizziness and paralysis (Keel 1988, 151, 153). Even the anti-Semitism displayed in the Yates affair has its place in the MIB tradition. Some of the UFO con- tactees of the 1950s possessed membership in fascist fringe groups that for political and racist reasons ac- cused the Jews of dispatching MIB. The personal papers left in the bookstore in lieu of adequate iden- tification contained mottos that re- vealed the man's prevailing state of mind: \"Seeking to Guide Society,\" \"Solve Unmet Social Needs,\" \"We Must Return to Traditional American Values or We Shall Face Decay. America First (including criminals),\" and \"Law, Truth and Justice (NOT JEWSTICE) for All.\" The display of anti-Semitism, rather than a momen- tary outburst, seems to have been a volatile part of his personal belief system. In fact, numerous radical political groups maintained that Jews sponsored the MIB to make life miserable for decent white Aryan folk (Clark 1980, 286). Another strange feature of the Yates incident is the presumed in- telligence and security background of MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 263 March 1990"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"the man. His personal effects left behind at the bookstore included photocopies of membership cards for the (1) American Security Council- National Advisory Board (expired 1982), (2) United States Congres- sional Advisory Board: Charter Mem- ber, and (3) United States Senatorial Club-Republican Party. According to the information culled from his per- sonal papers, the man was a consul- tant and analyst for a systems devel- opment electronic trading service and a member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers. When Robert Yates first asked him for proper identification that March evening, the man stated that the police had confiscated his driver's license after accusing him of being \"a foreign agent.\" Calling himself \"agent 005,\" he aspired to become an \"honorary member of the FBI, CIA, NSA,\" and he stated clearly that he was an adversary of the KGB. He claimed to provide legal services as part of what he referred to as his Private Bureau of Investigation (PBI). Clearly against lawyers and for the law, the man insisted that he in- vestigated corruption in the judicial system. He called himself a victim of numerous violations by \"organized white collar crime [and] corrupt local, state and federal agencies\" influenced by extreme Zionist organizations. Recall that the MIB tradition includes narratives and beliefs pointing to an alleged connection with spies, con- spirators, terrorists, and government intelligence officials. The man's fav- orite car is a 1976 Cadillac Seville! 6 All evidence indicates that the man dressed in black, who disrupted bus- iness in a Philadelphia bookstore, who defamed Jews, and who suffered a blow to the face, was an ordinary man of flesh and blood. He was neither ex- traterrestrial nor apparitional. He was not a government agent. He existed in the realm of the ordinary. And yet, in the confrontation with Robert Yates, this same man qualified as an authentic Man in Black. Existing simultaneously with the above facts are others that are nonordinary facts. The Yates account has features associated with both the mundane and fantastic worlds. It is a hybrid phenomenon of fact and fiction. We have noted numerous parallels between the Yates incident and other MIB cases. Even if there were no other corroborating MIB features to the Yates affair, the ghostlike non- veridical appearance and disappear- ance strongly suggest something out of the ordinary. The Yates account has features associated with both the mundane and fantastic worlds. It is a hybrid phenomenon of fact and fic- tion. The Yates story is only one form of phenomenon emerging today from the crack between the worlds, and because it reveals significant informa- tion about the nature of folklore and a unique category of experience, it warrants our attention here. Two Worlds? Crack experiences challenge our \"cognicentrism\" (Hamer [1980] 1982, xvii), that is, our narrow-conscious ex- perience, encouraging multiple con- sciousness of a richer reality. Bakhtim would refer to that mode as \"dia- logical,\" meaning an interrogation of single ways of seeing. The poet Wil- liam Blake wrote of a \"fourfold vision\" and asked that \"God us keep from Single vision and Newton's sleep!\" Ex- periences of multiple presence phenomena like the MIB require a conservation of both the objective and fantastic features in a way that main- tains their complementarity .without forcing them prematurely into a pleas- ing but false synthesis. The crack is a transition zone, where one realm passes through and blurs the boundary between two realities — for example, the mundane and the sacred, the material and the imaginative — that are simultaneously perceived by the same witness. It is a category of experience betwixt and between, constituting what Victor Turner ([1969] 1979, 97-130) calls a \"liminal\" state in the process of manifesting itself. Henry Classic (1975, 66) has noted that Irish \"mum- ming emerges as the interval between the concrete and the abstract closes ... It pitches mythically between dream and awareness. Mumming ... rises between these poles of Western thought, falsifying their purity, uniting them in mysterious imagery.\" The repetitiousness, simplicity, and seeming unreality of much folk art arises, according to Glassie (1975, 64), from \"its authors' sincere at- tempts to express a resonance be- tween a spiritual inner sound and an outward materiality.\" Robert Rickard (1988, 67) has likewise noted that \"the central phenomena of almost any folk tradition may have charac- teristics which are seemingly of this world and others which are more ephemeral, dreamlike, mythical, paranormal or even supernatural.\" Rickard argues that emphasizing one aspect over the other is \"an exercise in futility.\" Bill Ellis (1988, 268-9), who likewise has noted the ambiguous nature of border phenomena, insists that we \"abandon the simple dualism of classifying narratives into 'fiction' and 'nonfiction'.\" Perhaps it is useful here as part of our discussion of this blurred reality genre to consider a term employed in the field of optics. Paraxis signifies a par-axis — that which lies on either side of a principle axis or that which lies alongside the principle body. Technically speaking, a paraxial re- gion is an area in which light rays seem to unite at a point after refrac- tion. Object and image seem to become one here. 7 Picture yourself for the moment with an apple cupped in both hands, standing in front of your bedroom mirror. As you look at the mirror, it appears as if you and the apple fuse with the reflected image. The area ex- tending from the mirror's surface beyond to your reflected image is the MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 263 March 1990"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"10 The crack is a transition zone, where one realm passes through and blurs the boundary between two realities that are simultaneously perceived by the same witness. paraxial region. This region is an am- biguous reality, neither entirely real nor entirely unreal, but lying some- where indeterminate between these two states. Crack phenomena, like the Yates MIB encounter, initially establish their reality mimetically, that is, by treating the objective world ob- jectively, before bleeding into a more marvelous mode manifesting im- possibilities, were it not for its initial grounding in the mundane. Perhaps another visualization may be helpful. Picture yourself in your backyard looking directly at your neighbor's wall separating your yard from his. There is a crack in the wall through which a person might see vague figures and movements. We can say that those people who under- go extraordinary encounters have glimpsed those figures. Whether they first saw anomalies from the crack because they were once accidentally close to that area of the wall, or because some mundane event occur- ring near the crack made them there- after predisposed to look there, or because the family tradition taught them to look, we do not know. In any case, imagine also that there is a trellis or lattice in front of the wall, obscur- ing the crack. Most of us might not even be aware that the crack exists, not to mention being able to spot the shadowy figures behind the wall, be- cause the trellis — that is, our cultural map of reality — stands in the way. Because the crack in the axis of ex- perience exists between the visible and the obscure, phenomena emerg- ing here engender questions of vision and visibility, knowledge and reality. How do we see? What is sighted? What can be known? Experiences like those of Robert Yates possess both mundane and extramundane features and thus are a kind of phenomen- ological oxymoron. Here, straddling the axis between two worlds, an event is real in relationship to a manifesta- tion beyond the wall in the neighbor's yard and unreal, or fantastic, in rela- tion to one occurring in your yard. There exists a continuum of ex- periences where reality and imagina- tion imperceptibly flow into each other. 8 Reality Continuum The optical and wall metaphors discussed above are intended to in- dicate that special forms of folklore emerge at the phenomenologically rich borders along a reality con- tinuum. In 1904, William James ([1904] 1987, 1180) posited a reali- ty continuum when he noted that \"life is in the transitions as much as in the terms connected.\" He pointed out that events at these transitions seem to be more vibrant, as if the slight hesita- tions we experience there energize and heighten life. The Yates MIB in- cident challenges the validity of the dualistic mental-physical world of Descartes. Border phenomena reveal a pecul- iar mixture of discrete realms. These realities ignore our academic debates concerning the assumed divisions be- tween the mental and physical. What happens along the continuum of the usual and the strange happens as an indivisible act. Although the Yates encounter possesses both concrete and abstract features, it does not quite belong to either category. It is a unique third category produced from the coor- dinated workings of the parts, an ap- parent manifestation of the beyond continuous with the here and now. Encounters with the Men in Black and other nonordinary phenomena (such as out-of-the-body travel, near-death experiences, UFO abductions, and shamanic journeys) point to a con- tinuum of discrete but related folk phenomena (Rojcewicz 1984, 1986, 1988; Grosso 1986; Ring 1989; Thompson 1988; Kalweit 1988). Although encounters at the crack in the fabric of life are sometimes frightening and disarming, they never- theless point to a deep connection in the warp and woof of reality (Bohm 1980; Dossey 1982, 223). William James (1987, 1182) knew this to be true when in 1904 he said, \"The world is ... a pluralism of which the unity is not fully experienced as yet. But, as fast as verification comes, trains of experience, once separate, run into one another; and this is why ... the unity of the world is on the whole undergoing increase. The uni- verse continually grows in quantity by new experiences that graft themselves upon the older mass; but these very new experiences often help the mass to a more consolidated form.\" Naming & Named Numerous attempts to name ex- periences generated at the crack have been made. Henry Corbin (1977b, 17) has offered the term mundus im- aginalis, or simply the \"imaginal.\" Corbin argues that the world of the imagination is perfectly real and more coherent than the empirical world. Imagination, according to Ken Ring (1989), is a creative power that reveals a supersensible reality that can be directly apprehended. Similarly, Paul Veyne (1988, xii, 88) defines the im- agination as a transcendental faculty that creates our world. In his study of shamanism, Kolger Kalweit (1988, 125) argues that spirit beings encountered by shamans are \"more than mere psychodynamic complexes of the unconscious\" be- cause they are \"characteristic of a sup- rapersonal realm of consciousness.\" Michael Grosso (1988) has recently begun the important work of con- structing an \"imaginal\" taxonomy of nonordinary events. C. G. Jung ([1968] 1973, 99) coined the term psychoid to assert that although ar- chetypes originate in the mind, they occasionally transgress the psychic realm, and materialize, however tem- porarily, in the physical world, and MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 263 March 1990"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"11 thus are signals of the transcendent psychophysical background of reality (Jaffe 1979, 200; Rojcewicz 1988). Michael Talbot (1981, 2) utilizes the term omnijective to refer to a form of reality neither completely objective nor subjective but simultaneously both. Although such terms as paiaxial, im- aginal, psychoid, or omnijective can be helpful as initial probes toward under- standing nonordinary phenomena, it must be understood that the locking in of such phenomena with our termin- ology creates a potentially serious prob- lem. I have consciously refused here to prematurely image and name the nature of the Robert Yates incident (outside the use of the operative term crack experience necessary to begin our probe) until we can accumulate many more reliable examples. Only after the image is fully grasped should we even think of applying a rigid ter- minology. It is not that naming is bad in itself, but premature naming always is. Once it is imaged and named, the unknown is absorbed into the known, and nothing new can be learned. There are precedents for such caution. Naming is a means of incarnating, that is, of calling down the spirit. For this reason, the ancient Hebrews re- fused to image or name God, for no one was to limit deity. Early Christians baptized their children much later in life than Christians today. Naming a child soon after birth and before we have a viable image of his or her spirit is the reason that our names mean little to us. In the tradition of the Church, if you entered an order because you ex- perienced a period of visions of new spiritual development stretched over time, you took a new name to match the spirit of the vision. At puberty rites or vision quests, Native Americans left the confines of the tribal village, desir- ing an image or vision from which to take their names. The naming pro- cedures of the ancient Hebrews, early Christians, and Native Americans to- gether indicate that naming is an act that comes only after a clear vision of the spirit of the thing to be named is obtained. 9 The Persian poet Rumi writes that \"no ones knows our name until our last breath goes out\" (Ely 1983). Dostoevsky understood the difficul- ty in adequately naming new modes of reality when he stated in his Notebooks that \"reality is not limited to the familiar, the commonplace, for it consists in huge part of a latent, as yet unspoken future word\" (Jackson 1981, 19). Our experiences of what Dostoev- sky called a huge and latent reality are always more important than allowing our egos to get attached to any name that we provide for the experience. For without sufficient caution here, the motto of the scholar could be \"I see, therefore I do not understand.\" Flooding our research with abstract, ugly terms frustrates the formulation of accurate terminology, confuses our classification systems (Rojcewicz 1985), and, most unfortunately, fails to serve the people who look to us for help in comprehending their life experiences. Failing in the latter, we fail in our essen- tial roles as folklorists, as students, teachers, and friends of the people we study, the people we need. William'A. Wilson (1988, 166) clearly stated the nature of the grand enterprise of folklore on the occasion of the twenty- fifth anniversary of the UCLA folklore program: \"It is my belief that folklore will give us the best picture we can get of our fellow beings struggling to en- dure. And it is my even stronger con- viction that we have a duty to use the knowledge we have gained from folklore study, and the skills we have developed, to help each other prevail.\" In the same vein, Roger D. Abra- hams (1986, 65) has remarked that folklorists as humanists \"seek insight in- to life as a means of living more fully ourselves, of experiencing more knowledgeably and deeply, and thus being able to impart these techniques and this accrued knowledge and wisdom to others.\" Let this be our goal: to fuse concepts, beliefs, and ex- periences into a single open system for the use of folklore in everyday life — first to endure, then to prevail. NOTES This article was presented in abbreviated form as a paper at the Centennial Meeting of the American Folklore Society, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 29 Oc- tober 1988. Special thanks to Professors Michael Crosso, Jersey City State College; Fran Quinn, Assumption College, David J. Hufford, Hershey Medical Center; S. C. V. Stetner, Long Island University, C. W. Post Campus; Ron MacKay, Northeastern University; and Tom Burns, Univer- sity of Pennsylvania, for their stimulating conver- sation and helpful suggestions. 1. This is not to suggest that phenomena generated from naturalistic or supernatural sources cannot possess representational, symbolic or psychodynamic significance. It is not a matter of either/or nothing but; rather, all things are simultaneously themselves and signifiers of other things and meanings. I have argued this position regarding accounts of human sexual relations with nonhumans (Rojcewicz 1989, 8-12). 2. Andrew Lang wrote the following concerning what David J. Hufford (1982b) refers to as tradi- tions of disbelief: \"When psychical students are ac- cused, en masse, of approaching their subjects with a dominant prejudice, the charge to me, seems in- accurate (as a matter of fact) and, moreover, very capable of being restored. Not the man who listens to the evidence, but the man who refuses to listen (as if he were, at least negatively, omniscient) ap- pears to me to suffer from a dominant prejudice ... Of all things, modern popular science has most cause to beware of attributing prejudice to students who refuse its Shibboleth\" (Bennett 1987, 99). 3. Scholars interested in folk medicine have of late boldly entered the matrix of modern orthodox medicine to conduct systematic studies of beliefs not as superstitions to be catalogued but rather as dynamic factors in the patients' overall context of healing. A panel entitled \"The Relevance of Folklore to Modem Medicine,\" composed of Becky Vorpagel, chair, and Bonnie O'Conner, Richard Blaustein, Mag- gie Kreusi, Susan Pomerantz, and David J. Hufford, discussants, recently presented papers at the Centen- nial Meeting of the American Folklore Society in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on 27 October 1988. Two papers most pertinent to the present topic were Bon- nie O'Connor's (1988) \"Clinical Applications of the Folklorist's Skills\" and Becky Vorpagel's (1988) \"It's All in Your Head: The Role of Belief in the Construc- tion and Interpretation of Sickness.\" 4. In his published account of his MIB encounter, Bender states that grizzly monster-like UFO oc- cupants abducted him and brought him in a space ship to the South Pole. According to Bender, the MIB were paranormal entities whose mission was to collect mineral samples from Earth's oceans and bring them back to their planet \"Kazik.\" Bender states that up until 1960, when the MIB finally re- linquished control over his mind, he suffered in- capacitating migraines whenever he even thought about revealing the secret of the \"flying saucers.\" 5. UFO investigator Raymond E. Fowler (1982, 218) has written that \"MIB reports are not limited to the United States.\" John A. Keel (1975, 141) has reported that MIB have been encountered \"from Sweden to Spain, Australia to South America.\" Margaret Sachs (1980, 196), on the other hand, has claimed that although MIB have been active on the American scene since 1947, they \"rarely ap- pear in foreign countries.\" Despite some opinion to the contrary, a close examination of the data in- dicates an international scope of MIB activity.

The year is preferred because it marks America's bicentennial; the model is preferred for reasons unknown. 7. This union exists only as a virtual state and not an actual one. Crack phenomena, on the other hand, do actually exist as ambiguous modes of reality ex- perienced by witnesses. Special thanks to physicist- engineer Melvin A. Dachs for his helpful comments relative to the paraxis idea. 8. By continuum, I do not mean to suggest a lin- eality only. I do mean to suggest a multifaceted and successive phenomenon, no part of which can be absolutely separated from neighboring parts, except by arbitrary division. I mean to suggest a connected series or group possessing links or bonds between members of the whole, and so, perhaps, the words nexus, polygon, or spectrum are also useful probes. 9. It was Fran Quinn who helped me sort out my thinking concerning the naming process and who supplied me with a copy of the Rumi poem translated by Robert Ely.

P robably no one today should be solely defined by his or her major occupation. Bishop, baker, candlestick-maker, or for that matter, psychiatrist, painter or UFO researcher — none of these terms, we submit, necessarily tells the whole, or even most, of the truth about us. Though helpful to a point, these classifications can seem stifling, claustrophobic, and to the outside observer, misleading. We have other lives, other roles, other selves. I came into UFO research full-tilt in 1975, but I was, and still am, an ar- tist. Over the years the exhibition of my work has brought me into contact with people from widely varying pro- fessions, and like any of us, the peo- ple in these other groups vary enor- mously in their ethical standards, their competence and their ambition. Above all, they are only partially defined by their chosen professions. Outside of the art world, I am best acquainted now with two related groups: UFO researchers and psychiatrists. (And by this last term I mean to include, umbrella fashion, clinical psychologists and psycho- therapists). The resemblances between these two groups are striking. First of all, UFO researchers disagree — often violently — among themselves, with faction arguing against faction, each feeling it possesses the largest measure of truth. (I have, myself, often been involved in this kind of ideological dispute.) Argument is rife, with many of the most seasoned UFO researchers disagreeing on basic issues. But from years of close obser- vation of the psychiatric community I can say that exactly the same con- dition exists there, though some of their more radical and vitriolic on- going disagreements were formalized long ago into opposing institutions and organizations. Credentials No Guarantee Not surprisingly, possession of the credentials guarantees nothing within the psychiatric community, other than the opportunity to charge large fees. Within the UFO research communi- ty, the possession of vast stores of in- formation and the consumption of hundreds of UFO books again guarantees nothing, except, perhaps, the right to appear on a talk show and to claim to speak as an authority on the subject. Some members of the psychiatric community are among the most in- telligent, generous and helpful peo- ple I have been privileged to know, shining examples of mind and spirit, while others 1 have known are in- competent, unethical, and even emo- tionally unstable. But then we all know the sad, ob- vious truth about our own field: the same range of humanity exists among UFO researchers, where profound altruism and creative intelligence characterize some, while confusion, stupidity and avarice characterize others. If psychiatry has an occas- sional Leona Helmsley, UFO re- search, unfortunately, also produces an occasional Donald Trump. Most assuredly, the possession of credentials within MUFON or the American Psychiatric Association is no guarantee of mental stability. I well remember an emotionally disturbed psychiatrist leading me onto her porch so she could point out to me a near- by hill on which, she said, \"the Mafia sets up their lasers and aims them at my house in a plot to drive me away.\" She also showed me some normal- looking corrosion on a window frame as evidence that the Mafia was pour- ing acid on her storm windows. When I reported this and other, similar behavior to a well-known psychiatrist — a friend of mine — he told me that unfortunately very little can be done. Psychiatry is not known for rigorous self-regulation, and so far as 1 know this poor paranoid woman is still see- ing patients. UFO Horror Stories But if all of us know horror stories such as this involving members of the psychiatric profession, consider the many similar tales from within our own community: Not long ago I spoke with a distraught UFO abductee who reported a long telephone con- versation she had had with a noted UFO researcher. In her fragile state he had informed her as fact that the aliens are virtual cannibals, stealing tens of thousands of our children to use as food. In addition, they were castrating men left and right, and it was highly possible that she, herself might end up disappearing forever. The phone call led the woman to the brink of suicide, and it was only because of the careful reassurance of another UFO investigator that her ter- ror finally became manageable. U FO researchers and psychia- trists alike have personal prob- lems, hidden agendas and a wide range of deficits and skills. For my part, over the past fourteen years of working with hundreds of abductees, I know that I've been highly successful — but I also know that I've made mistakes, and that I'm not always the right person to deal with certain per- MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 263 March 1990"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"14 sonality types. Obviously, this kind of demanding work requires great subtlety of feeling and awareness of the emotional fragility of some of those we are try- ing to help. If you, the reader, are a UFO investigator who has worked with close-encounter witnesses or possible abductees, you know that what you have been doing, along with research, is a kind of de facto therapy already. You are also probably aware that in carrying out this de facto therapy - calming the witness, pro- viding grounding, reassurance and helpful information — success depends upon a mix of intelligence, empathy, common sense and psy- chological insight. Unfortunately, no training can guarantee these qualities. Some UFO investigators and some psychiatrists possess all of these desirable qualities and are naturally helpful. Sadly, other investigators and psychiatrists lack these basic assets and have demonstrably caused harm. Accumulation of Cases If the problems of dealing with each individual aren't serious enough, the cumulative volume of cases is virtually overwhelming. Over the years I have received literally thousands of letters as a result of the publication of In- truders; appearances on various television and radio programs have added even more. Many of those who have contacted me are people desperate for reassurance and infor- mation, and a large percentage desire hypnotic regressions to explore their disturbing memories. As a result I have created a not-for- profit foundation called IF, the acronym of the Intruders Foundation. Under its aegis I have established a network of therapists and hypnotist- investigators. A small group of peo- ple have aided me in the massive task of answering letters, routing cases to the various members of the helping network, and sending out information kits. This effort, it should be pointed out, began in the early 1980's with the let- ters I received in response to Missing Time, and has only recently taken a more precise shape. Though we have been able to help a large number of people, there still remain many hun- dreds who have received nothing from me — no reply to their letters, no referral to a hypnotist, no aid of any sort. We are working to end this problem, but the sheer numbers are daunting. We are limited in our ability to re- spond, partly by my care in selecting therapists and hypnotist-investigators. Dr. Rima Laibow, in a recent article in the MUFON UFO Journal, praised my work in this field as \"scrupulous,\" for which I am grateful. But this very scrupulousness slows our ability to deal more immediately with the problem. Most of those participating in the IF network have credentials as psy- chotherapists and are experienced in the use of hypnotic regression. The expertise of some lies in more tradi- tional medicine, and a few are highly skilled hypnotists from yet other backgrounds. But since working with abductees requires such an unusual combination of skill, information and common sense, assembling such a reliable network has proven difficult. Unfortunately I have already had to drop one psychiatrist from my net- work on grounds of price gouging and clinical incompetence. And I have stopped referring people to another hypnotist-investigator because of what I feel is his fantasy-tinged, even paranoid, view of the abduction phenomenon. Though the psychia- trist I mentioned is intelligent and has impressive credentials, and the hypnotist-investigator is sincere and possesses the requisite skills in hyp- nosis, I feel that sending abductees to either of them would be irresponsible. S everal people have recently urged that our dealing with UFO abductees be \"medicalized.\" These \"medicalizers\" insist that anyone wishing to explore his or her ex- periences through regressive hyp- nosis, no matter how emotionally stable and psychologically sound, should automatically.be regarded as the \"patient\" of a \"doctor\" — defined here as a psychiatrist, psychologist or psychotherapist. A corollary of this position, as one psychiatrist-proponent of medicaliza- tion is careful to point out, is that the abductee-patient should be asked to pay normal psychiatric charges for regressive hypnosis — charges which in one instance came to $500 for a single hypnotic session! And since many of us who have been doing this work for years do not charge anything for regressive hypnosis, one can easily suspect a financially self-serving motive on the part of those pushing for such forced and expensive medicalization. Virtually no abductee nor veteran hypnotist-investigator supports the medicalizers' attempt to undermine abductee rights in choosing either a therapist or a hypnotist-investigator. At any rate, the issue of who should and who should not work with ab- ductees — interviews, de facto therapy, regressive hypnosis and all — comes down to one of simple com- petence. Extensive training, profound knowledge of UFO history and the possession of elaborate credentials are all desirable — though none can guarantee either competence or ethical behavior. For the truth is that we are in a new and largely uncharted territory. Our best hope for success lies in our natural intelligence, our caring humanity and our simple common sense. Though some abductees are in definite need of formal psychotherapy — and the IF network includes many therapists for just such referrals — most abductees resent being sum- marily labelled \"psychiatric patients\" just because of their UFO encounters. Most, in fact, simply want to find out exactly what happened to them. Fourteen years of experience with the UFO abduction phenomenon have assured me that in hundreds upon hundreds of cases we have Continued on page 17 MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 263 March 1990"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"15 EARTHLIGHTS REVELATION: UFOs and Mystery Lightform Phenomena, The Earth's Secret Energy Force By Paul Devereux With David Clarke, Andy Roberts & Paul McCartney Blandford Press, 1989, 254 pp, 40 color illust., 22 line drawings, cloth, S 12.95 There are remarkable energies around our planet. Often invisible and intangible, they sometimes manifest as mysterious lights which account for at least a proportion of UFO reports. They may be the source of appari- tions, hauntings, poltergeist activity, 'mystery animals' and other such borderland phenomena. They appear to have a strange relationship with human consciousness and human in- tentions. Our understanding of them may be the key to considerable ad- vances in the knowledge of ourselves and the world we live in. These are the large claims made by this interesting and exciting book. It follows, of course in the line of suc- cession from Earthlights (Devereux & McCartney, Turnstone Press, 1982) and the work initiated by Persinger et al in Space-Time Transients and Unusual Events (Nelson Hall, 1977), both of which looked for earth-bound explanations for some of the weirder events that haunt us. Unlike much else in ufology, Earth- lights Revelation is a serious contribu- tion to science. It rests on a painstak- ing accumulation of facts and at- tempts to make correlations between them. It suggests the lines of further fruitful research. Above all, it offers some testable hypotheses. For this reason alone it deserves the closest at- tention, not only of ufologists, but of. scientists presently plumbing a wide range of disciplines. If some of my comments below are critical, then this is the compliment one pays to serious research. Main Thesis The main thesis of Revelation is that we have overwhelming evidence Reviewed by Ralph Noyes of the occurrence of transient forms of energy which tend to cluster in cer- tain areas, are poorly understood at present (to the extent that some scien- tists still deny their mere existence), and have properties which are akin to electromagnetism, but which may also require a radical expansion of our understanding of the latter. A special category of \"earth lights\" is suggested which the authors contend can be distinguished from such similar tran- sient phenomena as earthquake lights, ball lightning and Will-O'-the- Wisps. Earthlights are postulated as having very special properties, in- cluding the likelihood of engaging in a two-way interaction with human consciousness. We are even given hints (to be more fully explored in Devereux's forthcoming books, Earth- mind and Place of Power) that the siting of sacred monuments, along with much of mythology and folklore, is closely bound up with the Earth- lights phenomenon. Main Problems But the book faces two nagging problems. Can Earthlights actually and reliably be distinguished from other luminous \"transients,\" like those mentioned above? And secondly, what is the source of the energy which fuels them? Devereux continues to back his hunch that the answer to both questions lies in the marked tendency of certain kinds of anomalous events to cluster in distinct areas with equally distinctive geological characteristics, particularly surface or near-surface faulting (in- dicative of the proximity of tectonic strain), and the likely presence of cer- tain minerals. Since Earthlights was published in 1982, much further work has been done in support of Devereux's thesis, and his world-wide review of the re- cent evidence makes for fascinating reading. Particularly compelling is the summary of the work done thus far by David Clarke and Andy Roberts in several areas in the Pennines, which have proved extremely rich in haunt- ings, strange luminosities, and related folklore. And the correlation with geological factors in the cases Devereux examines is indeed strongly suggestive. But to my mind, at least, many un- certainities remain (as Devereux him- self acknowledges). For example, there is much faulting around the planet without obvious associated anomalies. The infamous \"ring of fire\" around the Pacific Rim is curiously selective about the precise points at which it will pro- duce \"UFO effects\"; and similar in- stances could be multiplied. Moreover, even when the geolog- ical association can be reasonably asserted, it is often markedly sporadic in its manifestations. By way of exam- ple, we have that amazing outbreak of \"luminosities\" over north Wales in 1904-5, apparently in intimate asso- ciation with one Mary Jones, the re- vivalist, which is strongly linked to local faulting; but oddly, not much of a similar vein has ever been heard of before or since from the same area. Devereux takes care to avoid press- ing his geological correlation too strongly. He accepts, for instance, that tectonic strain may wax and wane in response to, or alongside, other fac- tors, while arguing that it may operate indirectly over very considerable dis- tances. Devereux also acknowledges MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 263 March 1990"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"16 that despite the laboratory work on rock-crushing and the like (of which we receive an absorbing account), we are still far from understanding the precise mechanisms which can be assured of generating a ball of light high above ground level. Implications What this all implies is that we are still at a very exploratory stage in terms of knowing what weight to assess any geological factor; there must almost certainly be other com- ponents at work. And without wishing to lend any further credence to the ex- traterrestrial hypothesis, about which I feel as much skepticism as Dev- ereux. I think we are far from being able to assimilate the whole of the UFO phenomenon into its Earthlights counterpart. Can a mysterious object seen by an airliner at 30,000 ft. (and there are many such cases) really be the same thing as a small ball of light glimpsed skimming the Yorkshire moors? And can we confidently assimilate an iso- lated poltergeist outbreak in the Hebrides (pp. 214/15) with the same class of occurrences as those re- Can Earth Ugh ts actually and reliably be distin- guished from other lumi- nous ''transients,\" and what is the source of the energy which fuels them? markable luminosities in Norway's Hessdalen Valley? But it is the underlying strength of the book; in the final analysis, that prompts such questions and directs our attention to a naturalistic ap- proach to strange phenomena. In- terestingly and coincidentally, 1989 also saw the publication of a some- what similar work, Terence Meaden's The Circles Effect and Its Mysteries, which, while examining the entirely different problem of the so-called cropfield circles, came equally close to postulating a \"naturalistic UFO,\" with admittedly highly exotic proper- ties, as a solution or explanation. Conceivably, these two books have something to learn from each other; certainly, both are welcome to those of us who prefer searching for earth- bound explanations before accepting the hopeless position that we are merely the passive recipients of super- natural or extraterrestrial visitation.

The Road To Computerization By Dan Wright Wright is MUFON's Deputy Director, Investigations. I n June 1989, having evaluated the two hundred most recently sub- mitted case reports for completeness and clarity, the author assembled a basic list of pertinent case factors for an informal, all-comers session in Las Vegas where the MUFON 20th An- nual UFO Symposium was being held. A free-wheeling discussion, involv- ing at times over forty symposium at- tendees, resulted in a direction as well as a core group thereafter known as the intrepid \"Computerization Com- mittee.\" Our objective had been ably iden- tified years before by the late Dr. J. Allen Hynek when he remarked, \"We suffer from an embarrassment of riches.\" That is, if we only understood the UFO data already gathered, we would be well down the road to answering the essential questions: \"Where do they come from?\" and \"Why are they here?\" Soon thereafter, the Committee took shape, with Jennie Zeidman, MUFON's Coordinator of Technical Analysis, serving as traffic cop. The task involved three functions: (1) designing a new, more comprehen- sive MUFON Form 2, Computer In- put, along with instructions for its use; (2) selecting a suitable database soft- ware program; and (3) ensuring that the many thousands of existing MUFON case records are properly reviewed and encoded. To date, the first two of these functions have been completed. After numerous drafts submitted over the Autumn and Winter to the Committee members for comment, the expanded Computer Input form is now final, and supplies are available MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 263 March 1990"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"17 from MUFON state and provincial directors and from MUFON Head- quarters in Seguin, Texas. The new Form 2 is far more thorough, capturing the key elements of the remaining MUFON sighting forms in addition to certain other data from the written case report that has never before been gathered on a sighting form. It does not displace, but rather complements, the detailed in- formation that comprises an entire UFO case record. The Input Form is designed so that, in a less complicated (e.g. nocturnal light) case, most of the sections re- quire only a single entry. In any event, it will take longer to complete (perhaps half an hour in the most complex cases). In return, the in- vestigator will be assured that a per- manent, computerized record of the event characteristics can be used in a variety of ways in comparative research and analysis. \"Paradox\" The Committee's second, and con- current, function was to select database software powerful enough to load hundreds of thousands of data elements and retrieve them quickly in response to research requests. After much discussion, \"Paradox\" (by An- sa, a Borland company) was selected. As a relational database program, it is both highly sophisticated and \"user friendly.\" This state-of-the-art PC soft- ware has drawn kudos from computer magazine editors and will not be seriously superceded for years to come. Unlike previous attempts outside MUFON to create a UFO database, the procedures decided by the Com- mittee prohibit any individual's subjec- tive judgement from displacing the facts as documented in the case report. Examples: A case will not be ignored simply because there was a single reporting witness. Cases of vehicle pacing will be included even if the auto continued to operate nor- mally. And the person who prepares the case report need not be a \"name\" investigator. In short, there will be no attempt to reduce the many thousands of well documented cases to a few hundred in order to magnify the validity of those selected. For, in the end, such an attempt would only skew the data toward cases with obvious (i.e. less subtle) effects on the witness or environment. In fact, the database as arranged for our purposes will present all the critical factors of every substantially verified case during our 21-year history as well as those investigated in the future. It is the proper role of individual MUFON consultants, research specialists and investigators — and only them — to determine which cases and case factors they will pursue in comparative analysis. The only criteria for database inclu- sion, therefore, are the extent and clarity of the verification, as presented by the investigator, to demonstrate that the witness is reliable and that mundane explanations of the event are untenable. Certainly, many cases currently on file will not be encoded (though they will continue to be stored in hardcopy form). After all, the submirtal of a sighting form alone does not con- stitute an investigation. By the same reasoning, database integrity demands that an investigative summary provide more than an un- verified recounting of the witness' story. The case record must provide evidence to support a finding that natural phenomena and manmade objects played no part, and that the witness is both honest and a capable observer. Encoding Files The final stage in creating MUFON's database involves review- ing and encoding the many thou- sands of cases on file, a task which will dominate the time of several \"old hands\" over the next few years. These will be handled in reverse order of their submittal. In this manner, at an early point we will be ready to accept requests to search the more recent data for specific characteristics — even while the coding process con- tinues in respect to older cases. It is fair to say that the state of per- sonal computer technology had to catch up with our needs before a pro- ject of this magnitude was feasible. Frankly, at this point we cannot pro- ject with any certainty what the results will show. We can state with con- fidence, however, that this library of UFO phenomena will spur new ave- nues of research and, thereby, a host of surprises.

Fireballs, Video & Valium Space Shuttle Communications Portions of the communications be- tween Space Shuttle flight crews and their ground controllers (except for classified Department of Defense flights) are re-transmitted on amateur radio frequencies and can be heard on appropriate receivers anywhere in the world. This service is provided by the Goddard Spaceflight Center Amateur Radio Club in Maryland, and runs continuously from one hour prior to scheduled launch until landing of the Shuttle.

Japanese Video Enclosed is a color photograph of a UFO which was video-taped in Hakui City, Kanazawa Prefecture, Japan, on July 6, 1989, during a clear sunny day. A high-quality Sony video recorder was used to capture well over a minute's worth of the object's motion as it descended rapidly toward the Earth at a shallow angle of about 45 degrees relative to the horizon. Then, suddenly and unexpected- ly, it changed directions and rose at a steep angle and a speed that was so great that it disappeared from several video frames. It certainly was not an airplane, balloon, kite or model airplane. During this sequence, the object appeared only as a bright spot against the blue sky.

New England Fireball A dazzling fireball lit up the New England sky from Nova Scotia to New Jersey, Sunday evening, February 18th, of this year. It changed color from white to green to orange, and executed a loop in the course of its 10-second passage about 7:50 p.m. \"It went into a cloud and lit up like a sunset,\" said Walter Webb, assistant director of Boston's Museum of Science Hayden Planetarium. Webb, of course, is also a MUFON Consul- tant in Astronomy and author of the Journal's monthly \"Night Sky\" col- umn. \"The thing went up vertically and came down again in a closed loop,\" Webb added, \"leaving a glow- ing trail behind it.\" Webb was quoted in an article which appeared in the Boston Globe on February 23, 1990. Air Force per- sonnel said the object was almost cer- tainly a meteorite or incoming satellite. A similar article (contributed by Mr. Webb) in The Nantucket Beacon for Wednesday, February 21, said that \"Mysterious green lights in the sky above New England are not new. In a series of sightings in the summer of 1987, residents across southern Ver- mont reported seeing a bright green orb darting across clear skies. \"On one Thursday night, it reportedly hovered over a cluster of homes outside of Bennington long enough for several families to walk out of their homes and view it for several minutes.

The encounters of Ed and his fami- ly, along with numerous supportive sightings by highly credible people, are evidence of alien visitation. We believe that Ed was allowed 18 separate photographic sessions because the aliens wanted him to take pictures. One could logically assume this was done because they wanted people to see the pictures. Arrangements have been made to have the detailed story told in book form and on television.

Flannigan State Section Director, Chief Investigator UFOs & Valium? According to an article which original- ly appeared in The Washington Post, one of the world's most commonly administered prescription drugs, Valium, a member of the family of benzodiazepines, may be responsible for reports of imaginary sexual assaults and fantasies. The article (I'm working from the Houston Chronicle of March 5, 1990) cites the case of London dentist George Larah, who was recently acquitted of sexual assault charges lodged by MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 263 March 1990"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"20 seven female patients. Larah's lawyers presented apparently convincing evidence of a little known side-effect of Valium, a popular tranquilizer. The defense referenced a recent article in the prestigious British medical journal, The Lancet, which in turn referenced 43 alleged episodes of vivid sexual fantasies, including assaults that could not have possibly happened. According to the presiding judge, the women honestly believed their ex- perience was real, but it was also \"clear that there is a mounting body of evidence that patients under seda- tion from this class of drugs do sometimes experience erotic fan- tasies.\" Larah had prescribed Valium for all of the women who subsequent- ly lodged charges. The Lancet article seems to suggest that imaginary sexual assaults pre- dominate among women, but this could be because the popular tran- quilizer is not as commonly prescribed for men. Or it could be that the drug doesn't have the same effect on men, or that men are less likely to report sexual fantasies, if and when they occur. These are potentially curious find- ings in light of increasing reports of UFO abduction, and I hope someone will be driven to delve deeper. Ob- viously, it's out of the question for us to routinely demand that abductees undergo a urinalysis or blood test to detect the presence of Valium or other mood-altering chemical substances. Still, a question directed toward an ab- ductee's previous medical history, especially in regard to Valium and related medication, might eventually prove fruitful. Examining Earthlights B y now we've all heard of \"earthlights.\" Paul Devereux of Great Britian coined the term in 1982, when he published Earthlights. In that book Devereux developed the idea that UFOs are a byproduct of natural processes in the earth. Michael Persinger of Canada had already been saying the same thing for years in a continuous out- pouring of papers in which he developed his Tectonic Strain Theory of UFOs. Unfortunately, despite Devereux's and Persinger's passion for the con- cept of a UFO/earth stress link, neither researcher has yet proven the case that UFOs are purely a natural phenomenon. Rock has been crushed in the laboratory, eliciting ex- traordinarily brief pulses of light, but the result of that experiment — in the words of Brian Brady, who developed the experiment — cannot account for \"discrete\" light forms seen at high altitude (read: spherical UFOs at high altitude). In fact, Brady's experiment even does away with the famous \"piezo-electric effect\" as a source of UFOs; in terms of energy output, piezo-electricity is simply too weak to account for anything more than momentary, diffuse glows of light. More importantly, how can a mysterious, elusive and undefined physical mechanism create structured objects? This is the great failing of the \"earthlights\" theory: it attempts to solve the UFO mystery by ignoring the actual content of the UFO report. Any unexplained object seen in an earthquake-prone region — no mat- ter how artificial in appearance or \"in- telligent\" in its actions — suddenly becomes a byproduct of ionization, plasmas or some other little- understood electrical process. In 19811 began an investigation in- to UFO sightings that had occurred over 20 years in a single area, the Yakima Indian Reservation in south- central Washington state. In the ear- ly 1980's, the MUFON UFO Journal published several of my papers based on the preliminary findings. Now the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies has published my complete findings as a book: Examining the Earthlight Theory: The Yakima UFO Microcosm. Examining the Earthlight Theory looks microscopically at the Tectonic Strain Theory of UFOs. I use the Yakima data (nearly 200 reports from a variety of witnesses, plus numerous color photographs) to test the viabili- ty of the Tectonic Strain Theory which Persinger believes explains the Yakima sightings. The Yakima data form a \"microcosm,\" a fascinating, self- contained world of strange reports, which includes a range of unex- plained occurrences — orange balls of light, CES's, possible abductions, Bigfoot sightings, daylight objects, subterranean sounds and more. Near- ly every part of the Reservation ex- perienced some type of unexplained event over a 20-year period, making the Yakima Indian Reservation an ex- cellent \"laboratory\" for detailed ex- amination of UFO phenomena. Earthquake faults mark the ridges of the Reservation; it lies at the foot of the volcanic Cascade Range; and fire lookouts were in place on top of three mountains to observe and record strange lights year after year ... the right conditions for data collection, plenty of UFOs and more than enough meticulous documentation to whet the appetite of a curious scien- tist in search of an explanation. Examining the Earthlight Theory takes the reader on an historical journey, following the sightings to their most recent occurrence. All the data of this unique mini-flap are used to thoroughly evaluate the basic com- ponents of the Tectonic Strain Theory. Examining the Earthlight Theory is an experience in detective work, where all the facts of the Yakima microcosm are weighed, sifted and evaluated in the systematic pursuit of a solution to the mystery of the microcosm. Examining the Earthlight Theory is available from the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies: 178 pages; 16 color and b/w photos, maps, drawings, tables, index. $17.95, plus $2.00 for postage and handling. — Greg Long MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 263 March 1990"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"21 Looking Back Bob Gribble March 1950 • Fully half of Farm- ington, New Mexico's population was sure that it saw space ships, hundreds of them, flying overhead on the 17th. Estimates ranged from \"several\" to more than 500. They caused a ma- jor sensation in Farmington, which is located 110 miles NW of the Los Alamos atomic installation. The ob- jects appeared to play tag in the air. At times they streaked away at unbelievable speeds. Using triangulation, a witness estimated the speed of one object at about 1000 mph, and its size as twice that of a B-29. \"I'm not an engineer,\" Harold F. Thatcher said, \"but I have engineers working under me, and I know how to work out a rough triangulation on an object.\" He emphatically denied a report that the objects could have been small pieces of cotton floating in the at- mosphere. The \"cotton\" explanation was initiated by State Patrolman Andy Andrews, who quoted several residents to that effect. Those quoted later denied Andrew's report. The first sightings occurred a few minutes after 9 a.m. All but one of the objects were silver; what appeared to be the leader of the fleet was red, and both bigger and faster. John Bloom- field said they appeared to be travel- ing ten times as fast as a jet plane and made frequent right-angle turns. \"They appeared to be coming at each other head-on. At the last second, one would veer at right angles up- ward, the other at right angles downward. One vehicle would pass another, and immediately the one to the rear would zoom into the lead.\" Marlow Webb said the craft \"flew sideways, on edge, and at every con- ceivable angle. This is what made it easy to determine that they were disc- shaped.\" The fleet of discs continued to maneuver over the city until 11:30 a.m., when they sped out of sight to the NE. There was no doubt about the physical nature of the craft. Three and a half hours later, at 3 p.m., another fleet of discs appeared over Farmington, flying in formation and approaching from the NE. Only this time, instead of stopping, the fleet continued toward the SW and even- tually disappeared over the horizon. Clayton Boddy, business manager of the Farmington Daily Times, noted that, \"We contacted the Air Force and they denied everything. They said it didn't happen.\" Lincoln O'Brien, the paper's owner, remarked that the wire services were reluctant to believe the story: \"We finally got AP to accept the story, phrased in a rather doubting manner.\" On the same day, a similar UFO manifestation occurred over Tucum- cari. New Mexico, resembling the Far- mington case even to the presence of a single red-colored craft in with the fleet of discs. •1955 On the 28th, former Air Force pilot Glenn Blansett and his wife spot- ted a large, circular cloud of smoke high in the sky over Joseph City, Arizona, accompanied by what he thought was a large formation of jet planes engaged in mock combat. But after several minutes, the objects stop- ped their conventional maneuvers, abandoned formations, and entered into a strange fluttering motion, mov- ing much faster than conventional jet aircraft. Blansett and his wife agreed that there were at least 25, and perhaps more than a hundred of the craft, moving across a clear blue sky at a high speed before disappearing to sight in the SW. • 1960 Eastern Airlines Capt. Erie W. Miles, his co-pilot and engineer, and the captain of another airliner fly- ing below, spotted a \"huge craft\" while the two planes were just SW of Gor- donville, Virginia. Another crew reported seeing it a few minutes later in South Carolina. \"We were at 14,000 feet,\" Miles said. \"It was still fairly light at our altitude and visibility was perfect. This thing came overhead just off our right side. We all three saw it. It was unlike anything we had ever seen before. It was tremendous in size — looked like a greatly enlarged fuselage of a modern day plane barreling through the air. It was clearly visible, including the outline of its shape and certain details. \"There were no wings or protru- sions on the body that could have balanced or directed it. I could see no windows or markings, but it looked like there were running lights around it. It was gone across the sky and had disappeared in about 50 to 55 seconds. From what we know of flight speed, it was moving at about 6000 miles per hour. I was talking to air- ways control at the time and told them what we saw. Capt. Bob Neal was fly- ing a Constellation below us and reported the same thing. A few minutes later we got a report from the Columbia, South Carolina tower say- ing they had sighted it.\" In addition to the two crews, Capt. Miles said another airliner had seen the craft over Anderson, South Carolina. The 51-year-old captain added that he talked to his and other crews about it, and they were all reluctant to report the incident \"for fear we'd be called crackpots.\" He said that the \"atmos- phere isn't encouraging\" for pilots to Continued on next page MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 263 March 1990"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"22 report UFOs and that he would have said nothing about it if the observa- tion had been less sensational. • 1965 Two airliners flying from Osaka, Japan, to Hiroshima were chased by a strange object over the Seto Inland Sea. The Emergency reports were made to the Takamatsu Air Safety Office on the 18th. The Convair 240 aircraft of the Toa Air Lines with 28 passengers aboard was flying over the Deshima Islands southwest of Himeji City, Hyogo Prefecture, at an altitude of about 2000 meters at 7:06 p.m., when chief pilot Yoshiharu Inaba, 43, suddenly noticed something oblong and luminescent approaching his plane. It came close to the airliner, stop- ped, made an abrupt turn and flew along with the aircraft for about three minutes. It finally disappeared in the direction of Takamatsu City on Shikoku Island. About thirty seconds later, the Takamatsu Air traffic control tower received another emergency call from a Piper Apache plane of the Tokyo Air Lines that it was being pursued by a UFO over Takamatsu City. According to Inaba, when the ob- ject came dangerously close to his plane he signaled his position and made a 60-degree turn to the right to avoid collision. \"The craft was about 15 meters in diameter. As it radiated a greenish light, I could not ascertain its exact shape. I did notice, however, that the two needles of the automatic direction finder vibrated violently,\" In- aba said. The vehicle that chased the two air- craft was also seen from the ground by three workers of the Chugoku Electric Company at Hiroshima. Kat- suo Asano, 43, chief engineer of the Fuchu office of the company, Toshiro Sakurai, 25, and Terumi Tahara, 23, were in a car on a highway at Yuki Town, Kamiichi-gun, around 7 p.m. when they saw a strange object in the sky. \"It was shaped like a triangle whose top radiated brilliant light. It was in sight for about 10 seconds,\" they said. • 1975 A strange case involving a pregnant cow occurred at Ellsworth, Wisconsin about the end of the month. It seems that a farmer had a cow that was about to have a calf, so he was holding her in a barn where he could keep a close watch on her. One night a neighbor called and ex- citedly told him there was a glowing red light directly over his barn. He went out to look, but found nothing unusual. A few days later, the cow still had not given birth so he called the veterinarian. After the vet ex- amined the cow, he turned to the farmer and said, \"This cow calved at least three days ago!\" But there had never been any sign of a calf, or traces of birth. • On the 13th at 9 p.m., 15-year- old Jane Baker had just let her two cats outside when she saw a strange object parked on the road outside the family's farmhouse near Mellen, Wisconsin. She screamed — and her father, Phil Baker, 37, rushed outside, followed by his wife and two of their sons. \"I didn't believe what I was seeing,\" Baker said. \"It was circular, about 12 feet across, with red and bluish-green lights running around the outside. In the center was a door, with a brilliant light coming from inside. It made a high-whining sound — a sound I'd never heard before.\" The family stared wide-eyed at the craft for several minutes, then raced fearfully inside their home. \"I no sooner called police when there was this loud explosion,\" Baker said. \"I looked out and the thing had vanished.\" The same night, seven sheriff's deputies spotted four different mysterious vehicles skipping and gliding, through the skies in a four- county area around Lake Superior's southwest shore. Ashland Deputy Drolson, 24, was excitedly describing one such craft zipping directly overhead when his police radio went dead. \"The vehicle made a whooshing sound, like a giant gust of wind roaring through the woods,\" Drolson said. Ashland Undersheriff George Ree, listening on his radio 18 miles away, heard the rushing noise \"and then Drolson's radio went blank.\" A few moments later, Drolson's voice came back on the air. • \"Nothing from this world could fly like that!\" exclaimed Keith Nance, 14. He was referring to a mysterious oval- shaped craft he and a friend saw mak- ing 90-degree turns near his home at Antioch, California, at 12:54 a.m. on the 27th. After dawn, Keith and his buddy, Richard Gill, 16, examined a field the vehicle hovered over. They came across a depression about a foot and a half long and several inches wide in a small open area of compacted sand in the mid- dle of a grassy field. Next to the depression was a compacted mound of sand, the same size, shape and length of the furrow. Keith said he saw a tube emerge from the craft with a nozzle on the end the approximate shape of the depression. When the vehicle left, it flew off between two trees. The limbs of the two trees branch straight out and touch, except towards the top of the trees where there was a space and no longer any limbs. • 1980 Mysterious light forms were spotted over Burlington, Vermont, about 10 p.m. on the 22nd by air traf- fic controllers and police officers. \"The lights I saw were not like anything I had ever seen before,\" said Donald Kernan, an air traffic controller at Burl- ington International Airport. Another controller, Richard Morris, said they showed up on the airport radar screen. \"It was a radar target that was not identified,\" he said. It moved about four miles in two sweeps of the radar scanner. That would translate into a velocity of about 1500 mph if it were an airplane. The radar screen showed small or faint objects, similar to three small aircraft, joining a larger, brighter object, then separating into four objects again, Morris added. Within minutes the light forms disappeared to the east. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 263 March 1990"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"23 LETTERS TO THE EDITOR ... Giving Crop Circles A Whorl Dear Editor: I am terminally curious about the crop circle phenomenon. Of all the comments that come to mind, I can think of only one that makes any con- tribution at all to the puzzle. I remember having read an observation by a mathematician once about the whorl effect of the crown of the human head, namely that the ob- served whorl pattern is not a biological feature (i.e., hair does not sprout from the scalp in a whorl pattern — assum- ing no baldness, it grows more or less evenly distributed over the entire scalp). The whorl pattern does not exist as long as all the hair (wheat, etc.) is standing straight up. It is only created when the hair is flattened (or combed, as the case may be), and some hope- lessly arcane principles of math govern the inevitable formation of a whorl. The whorl occurs only when a roughly circular area is flattened (the surface of the scalp is circular around the crown if projected onto a plane, according to this hairy Einstein). Obviously, if a whole wheat field were flattened by a straight wind, all the wheat would fall in a uniform direction. The irreverent thought oc- curred to me to wonder whether one's hair whorls clockwise south of the Equator, and if so, whether one would feel it rearrange itself if one took a speeding Concorde from, say, New York to Buenos Aires, but the mathematician wisely avoided attack- ing that issue. Do crop circles occur in the southern hemisphere and if so, do they whorl in reverse there? My point (if there is one) is that a whirling wind is not required to pro- duce a whorled effect in the case of upright rods attached at one end over a roughly circular area. The rods would automatically fall in a whorl pattern when knocked over as long as they cannot fall in any other way. What intrigues me is the perfection of the pattern, which a natural wind would never create, anyway. It would seem instead that something slowly pushed or sat down on the field, giv- ing the stalks time to find their natural fall pattern rather than taking place so quickly as to produce a chaotic pat- tern, and at the same time changed the light-seeking property of the crop so that the stalks, once laid over, con- tinued growing horizontally, which is another mind bender. That feature is at least as difficult to explain as the formation of the whorls in the first place. The only thing I can come up with at all would be a biological factor, such as a gene-changing fungus that modifies the light-guided growing direction of plants or perhaps simply destroys the ability of the stems to stand at all, and perhaps causes the crop to lay over in the first place. But how could it spread in such perfect circular patterns? However, fairy ring mushrooms are known for growing in highly regular circles, so who knows? — Mike Stacy Carrollton, TX Mr. Ralph Noyes, Esq. of London, author of several timely updates on the crop circle phenomenon for the Journal, responds: Obviously, we can't leave Mr. Stacy in this near-terminal state. Hopeful- ly, the following will resolve his con- dition — one way or the other. First, I might point out that I've recently received a communique from another local correspondent which hints that the phenomenon could date back to at least 1678. I'll leave the final acceptance of that particular datum to a majority vote, however. Secondly, it can't be a fungus. The circles occur very suddenly. Some can be dated to within a period of a few hours, and there are reasons to think they form in a matter of seconds. Funguses, however rabid, don't do that. Moreover, the well-known fungus circles (the \"fairy rings\") stay in the same place year after year, slowly expanding; the crop-circles never occur in precisely the same spot from one year to the next (though they do tend to \"haunt\" certain areas). The analogy with the 'top-knot' whorl is interesting (albeit I haven't yet tried it on a physicist). But if Mr. Stacy is arguing that we don't need a whirl- ing disturbance to produce that whorl, I suspect he's wrong. I feel sure he can secure a wholly straight-raked looked in this coiffure by drawing his comb accordingly. If he cares to experiment (particularly in Buenos Aires), I'll pull what strings I can to get a properly documented paper published either in Nature, Playgirl, or that even more prestigious English quarterly, Hairflair. But it looks like a vortex to me. The funny thing is that the first circles seen in 1980 and '81 were all clockwise. Meteorologist Meaden didn't like this, and said so. The phenomenon immediately came to heel. Nowadays we get about half and half. You also asked about biochemical changes in the crops. Some very in- judicious statements in that regard have been made over here, to wit, that the disturbed grain may be dangerous to human health. There isn't a shred (or should I say, grain) of evidence for this. Nonetheless, some people are now convinced that mechanical forces alone cannot ac- count for the obedient collapse of the grain in such delicate patterns. There is an indication that something molecular happens to the stalk near or at ground level. We're hoping that a good agronomist can be got onto the scene very quickly next year. Dear Editor: The book by Terence Meaden, The Circles Effect and Its Mysteries, was discussed by Ralph Noyes in the Oc- tober issue. The topic provided an op- portunity for me to bring the phenom- enon to the individual attention of nine colleagues at Oregon State Uni- versity who work either in atmos- MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 263 March 1990"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"24 pheric sciences or in plant or soil sciences, all with PhD degrees. Six of the nine concluded that it could only be the work of intelligence, one more leaned that way, and two avoided talking about it. Six of the nine are associated with the Department of At- mospheric Science, and none of them gave any support to Meaden's view that the circles were caused by natural atmospheric vortices of a previously unknown type. Readers of the British magazine Weather, in which Meaden had an ar- ticle on the circles in January 1989, evidently felt likewise and were left with no alternative but hoax as the solution, which they proposed in let- ters to the editor in April. Meaden, in the article and in his book, did state some of the reasons for ruling out the hoax hypothesis; however, the book Circular Evidence by Delgado and An- drews is much more thorough in this. For example, regarding the circles in the rape crop, they mention how brit- tle that crop is and how impossible it .is to bend its stems over manually at the ground without their breaking. Their book is also much less specu- lative, whereas Meaden frequently speculates that some sort of obscure electro-magnetic vortex is causing the phenomenon, then in the following sentence speaks of this as represent- ing the solution to the problem. The most serious omission of Mea- den's book is any mention of the growth of the crop that occurs after- wards within the circles, but growth that is horizontal. In Circular Evidence that aspect is clearly pointed out. This aspect alone eliminates the atmos- pheric vortex theory. Circular Evi- dence is also superior in its review of previous evidence associated with UFO sightings in which circular land- ing traces were left behind, including the one previous case where the subsequent growth within the circles was reported to be in the horizontal direction. I fear that Noyes was taken in by Meaden's pseudo-scientific presenta- tion. However, it is to Meaden's credit that he was able to place an article about the subject within the magazine called Weather. His self-published journal, the Journal of Meteorology, which has articles on the phenome- non, is not to be confused with the primary journal of the American Meteorological Society which once had that same name. — Jim Deardorff Corvallis, OR Dear Editor: With reference to the January 1990 article by Dennis Stillings on Jung, I would like to note that the quotes used in Above Top Secret were the best that I had available at the time. Last year a British researcher pointed out that the translation I had used (published in FSR in 1955) was misleading, and he thankfully pro- vided a more accurate version, the one published in The Collected Works of C. G. Jung. 1 have been able to amend future editions of my book accordingly. I was likewise ignorant of Jung's rebuttal to the press release, for which I apologize. There was certainly no deliberate intention on my part to misrepresent Jung, as Mr. Stillings implies. And with regards to his comments on \"the very silly book\" which I co- authored with the late Lou Zinsstag on Adamski, both Lou and I at- tempted to be as objective as possi- ble about this controversial contactee, and cited evidence both for and against his claims. Mr. Stillings implies that we both gullibly and uncritically accepted his story at face value, which is far from the truth. — Timothy Good Kent UK Dear Editor: In its extensive coverage of the UFO enigma, the MUFON Journal is to be congratulated for its consistent- ly high quality. Yet as with any human endeavor, errors creep in. I refer specifically to Bob Cribble's \"Looking Back\" column in the June 1989 issue, page 20, first column, last paragraph. Gribble quotes a Lt. Col. John O'Mara of Wright Patterson AFB as saying, \"Dr. Clyde W. Tombaugh and Dr. Lincoln La Paz are heading a pro- ject in White Sands, New Mexico, where scientists are tracking two ar- tificial satellites circling our planet.\" I met Dr. Tombaugh in June of 1978, in his office on the campus of New Mexico State University. He was professor emeritus there and did a great deal of public relations work on behalf of the university. During our two-hour conversation we touched on many bases, including his earlier UFO sightings in the company of his fami- ly. At that time I asked him to com- ment on the published claims that he and his team of investigators had discovered artificial satellites in orbit about the earth. He denied anything of the sort, and also gave me printed copies of that particular study. I recently sent him Xeroxed copies of the article in question, plus others on the same subject. I have been authorized to pass along his reply: \"I never had a joint project with Dr. Lincoln La Paz of Albuquerque. I was the principal investigator of an obser- vational project (known as) Search for Possible Natural Small Earth Satellites ... (but) three years searching in over 100 zones at different distances from the earth, each with its own computed angular drive and nearly 1500 films, revealed no such objects. It was therefore concluded that astronauts could fly to the moon with little risk of damaging collisions. We certainly found no satellites at 400 and 600 miles from the earth.\" — Americo Candusso Medina, OH Dear Editor: Bob Cribble's monthly feature, \"Looking Back,\" is an excellent idea which could help newcomers to the field acquire an accurate perspective of the golden days of ufology.

This is a must, as it is the only way researchers can follow the pedigree and value of any case listed. In recent issues, however, the ac- curacy of what is reported has deteriorated, and since no sources are indicated, only a small number of specialists with a deep knowledge of the field are able to detect the incor- rectness of the information presented. Two examples will illustrate the point: a) The Journal #257, Sept. 1989, p. 13, the case of Marius Dewilde is presented without mentioning that the incident is now considered a fraud by serious researchers. b) In Journal #261, January 1990, p. 23, the very dubious Botta affair is so distorted that I could hardly iden- tify it. The name of the single witness is Enrique Bossa or Enrico Botta, an Italian architect allegedly then living in Argentina. There is no such thing as a Province of Bahia Blanca, which is in fact a city in the Province of Buenos Aires. All the information is obtained from letters written by the witness, and the exact date is known. The interested reader can find a com- plete analysis of the case in IUR, Vol. 11/#1, Jan./Feb. 1986, p. 18. I understand that it is difficult to secure enough accurate information about a case, as well as its sources, unless one has access to a data base like UNICAT. We in the UNICAT Pro- ject would be happy to research for Mr. Gribble the cases he is consider- ing for publication, and provide free of charge whatever information we may have, which could well be none. This is the second or third time we have made the offer, which for some reason has never been taken up. - Dr. Willy Smith UNICAT Project My source for the Tombaugh - La Paz information was Len Stringfield's C.R.I.F.O. Newsletter, Vol. 1, No. 24, July 2, 1954. Stringfield received the information from Col. John O'Mara during a telephone conversation with him on June 8 of 1954. It appeared to be a reliable source, so I included it in the \"Looking Back\" series. But I appreciate your bringing this matter to the forefront. Even though back-dated, it's important to keep the record straight. — Bob Gribble Seattle, WA Dear Editor: Having read The Gulf Breeze Sightings by Edward and Frances Walters, published by William Morrow Company (1990), and mindful of the power of a book to change the world, I believe MUFON deserves a little self- congratulations. Implicit in MUFON's integral role in the making of this book is its farsighted leadership. When events broke in Gulf Breeze, Florida (by virtue of publication of pic- tures in the local Gulf Breeze Sen- tinel), MUFON was ready. A leader- ship that was committed to the resolu- tion of the UFO phenomenon, no matter what, created the resources to have trained investigators ready-to-go, if and when. No investigative reporters probed for, evaluted and preserved the evi- dence (Dave Berry, Pulitzer prize win- ning writer, casually dismissed the case as laughable). No universities sent academicians. No government agency openly committed resources to study this ongoing phenomenon of such potential cosmic consequences. But for the vision and tenacity of people like Don Ware, Charles Flan- nigan, Walt Andrus, Bruce Maccabee; Budd Hopkins, Bob Oechsler, et al, this case would likely have suffered the ignominious fate of similar \"classic\" cases, i.e., relegation to the archives of the Sentinel or some equally musty shelves of collectors of the arcane. This time, I think the world will know. Congratulations. — Robert H. Bletchman Calendar of UFO Conferences for 1990 April 6,7,8 — Ozark UFO Conference - Inn of the Ozarks, Eureka Springs, Arkansas.

Bright Planets (Morning Sky): From left to right, Venus (-4.2), Mars (0.9), and Saturn (0.5) occupy the SE dawn sky. The crescent Moon lies near Mars on the 20th and near Venus on the 21st and 22nd. In midmonth the latter two planets rise about 2 hours before the Sun, while Saturn rises about 4 hours before. Jupiter sets in the NW about 1 AM daylight time. Meteor Shower: Unlike last year, there is no moonlight to interfere with the April 22 dawn maximum (about 15/hour) of the Lyrid meteors. Radiating from an apparent point SW of Vega, the Lyrids are bright, white and swift, frequently leaving .glowing wakes which remain in the atmosphere for a few seconds. Comet Austin: What could be the brightest naked-eye comet since 1976 may now be favorably visible — Comet Austin, which was discovered last December by New Zealand amateur comet hunter Rodney Austin. On April 1 the object, sporting a short vertical tail, might be seen without optical aid briefly about an hour after sunset very low in the WNW about 6° to the upper right of orange-tinted Mercury. (The chances of seeing it are better with binoculars.) About a week and a half later Austin appears brighter (predicted to be zero magnitude) but lower, about 17° to the right of Mercury. Beginning in mid-April, look in the NE morning sky about 4:30 (EOT). On the 15th the comet is very low and 5° below the star Beta Andromedae. Each morning thereafter the comet's position improves, getting higher in the sky (passes 1° from Beta Andromedae on the 19th and 20th) and dim- ming only slightly to a predicted 1st magnitude. Best viewing should be late April through early May when the Moon is out of the way. Comet Austin's position on the 14th is at R.A. Ih 26m, Dec. +30° 36' (1950 coordinates); on the 24th, Oh 42m, +35° 36! For comet updates, call S/cy & Telescope's recording at (617) 497-4168. Moon Phases: First quarter — April 2 Full moon — April 9 Last quarter — April 18 New moon — April 25 O The Stars: At 10 PM daylight time a dozen Ist-magnitude objects can be sighted across the mid-April heavens. Vega has just emerged above the NE horizon; Arc- turus (in Bootes) and Spica (in Virgo) are found in the east and SE; Regulus (in Leo) is high in the south; the six stars of the Winter Circle — Sirius, Procyon, Pollux, Capella, Aldebaran, and Rigel — are in the west; and finally inside the Winter Circle are the star Betelgeuse and the planet Jupiter. This month the Big Dipper hangs high up in the northern sky. Actually, the dipper's bowl forms the body of the Great Bear, Ursa Major, while the 3 stars in the handle outline the animal's long, bushy tail. (Real bears, of course, don't have long tails!)

An advance registration form was enclosed in a majority of the February 1990 issues of the MUFON UFO Journal. If you did not receive one, please use the in- formation above for your hotel reser- vation and registration. (Please advise the name as you would like it shown on your nametag; since many of us use nicknames.) Computerized Files All members are invited to read the article by Dan Wright, MUFON's Deputy Director, Investigations, titled, \"The Road to Computerization\" in this issue of the Journal as an introduction to the forthcoming program which will soon be a reality. Dan Wright, Jennie Zeidman and their committee are to be highly commended for this monumental task. The fourth edition of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual has been delayed intentionally so as to include not only the new Computer Input Form No. 2 and the 12-page instruc- tion sheet, but also to compose and in- clude major revisions, including abduc- tion cases and treatment of the victims. Five hundred additional copies of the third edition were published to satisfy the current demand for this essential manual. Since it is printed in a 3-ring binder format, plans have been made to incorporate the new Computer Input Form 2 with accom- panying instruction sheets into the 3rd edition before they are mailed.
