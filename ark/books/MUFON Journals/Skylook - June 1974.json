Pierce, and two of them said the object had windows. Danny Prezkop, 13, and- Jeff Snead, 10, said they saw the object approach from the north and descend to Indian River -level. \"It was bright orange, almost too bright to look at,\" said Prez- kop. \"And it hummed something like an airplane, but it was- going far too fast for that.\" . Both youths said they saw what appeared to be windows in the aft-section of the cigar-shaped object. \"It was big,\" said Prezkop, .\"maybe 20 feet long and 10 feet high, but this is only a guess. And it was coming fast. It had a tai'l of orange fire coming from the tail like .a comet, but we knew it wasn't a comet.\" He said. the object, began to slow down and drop toward the water. \"It got real low until we thought it was going to land. Then we could see a barge or yacht traveling up river and for a minute we thought -the thing would hit it, that's how low it was. Just as it looked sure there would be a crash the object lifted, in- creased speed, and vanished to the south. Al- ways I have wanted to see a UFO, and now I have.\" The boys notified the Coast Guard and were told to call again if they saw the object again. A neighbor, Michael Small, 16, .also reportedly saw. the object, as did his mother, Mrs. Thomas I. .Small... \"It was so \"bright you could hardly look at it,\" said Mrs. Small, . \"and it seemed to come right down on top., of us. I've never, been so frightened in all my life. She said the orange- red object was \"huge. It was round with\" some kind of fins .sticking out from the sides. It 'came down so low I just didn't know what was going to hap- pen. Then it began to lift and went off so fast you could hardly keep track of it. I thought it went straight up, but .nothing in this world trav- els as fast as that thing did.\" The family call- ed\" the sheriff's office and were treated polite- ' Spinning disc reported in Missouri Following is a report from MUFON investigator John F.

Unfortunately, the wheels of investigation have turned slowly in this case, and there seems to be no reason to continue to hold this report. A segment of film sent to MUFON Photo Consultant Adrian Vance has been returned by Vance as unreli- able for investigative purposes because it has been clipped from the original full roll. There has been nothing but a preliminary an- alysis from the marine geologist who is ex- amining rocks allegedly related to the sight- ing. Other collaborating evidence is yet to be checked and analyzed. There have been conflicting reports in the press concerning the sighting and the location of the rocks allegedly related to the sighting. Most of the information in the following article comes directly from a taped interview of the witness by Larry Moyers, MUFON director for Ohio, who talked with the witness while in Florida. The facts stated in this article are therefore based on this interview of the wit- ness. Patrick Thrush, 16, of Bradenton, Fla., report- edly observed a UFO hovering over the Braden River Dec. 13, photographed the object, and re- trieved rocks which were dropped from it. Thrush was driving towards a friend's house a- bout 9:10 or 9:15 p.m. when he saw what appeared to be a plane going down. Wishing to investigate, he drove down Manatee Avenue, a main thorough- fare. After crossing the first bridge, he saw nothing, and started to turn around on the em- bankment. As he was going back toward a hill the high beams of his car lights revealed an object hovering over the Braden River, about 20 or 25 feet above the water. He estimated the diameter of the object as about 20 or 25 feet, and said it was about 11 or 12 feet thick. There was \"some type of a pro-, jection going down into the water.\" He got out. of his car to look at the object,- then returned to the car to get his camera \"and took several exposures,\" two of which were usable. Thrush said he was using a Canon 35mm camera with a 1.4 lens wide open, -a 1700 electronic flash unit, and panatomic film. The scene was also illuminated by the high beams of Thrush's auto. The shutter speed was set on automatic, and Thrush said the shot was probably taken at 1/30 of a second. He said the object was \"not giving off much • light of its own,\" and that fo- cusing was difficult. He said he set the focus at about the midway point, and that the object was slightly out of focus at the f/1.2 opening used. Thrush said that \"we did a Kodalith (high contrast film) series -on this for images that might not have picked up on various densities.\" He said that.on the lighter image a dome-like section coming from the bottom of the object was observed which was \"definitely not visible\" on normal prints of the negative. The lighter print showed that the entire image was connected, he explained. Thrush said the projection from the object at first appeared to be about four or five feet in diameter but tests he made with the high-contrast Kodalith film indicated that what appeared to be an extreme width of the tube-like projection was a \"flare effect,\" and that he now feels the pro- jection was \"definitely much narrower, perhaps a foot and a half at its thickest—maybe more. There are some people who say it possibly might be some source of light. On both the light and heavy contact prints you notice a segmentation as though it were emitted in bursts. It shows an expansion like light, but it did not have a glow of its own. It was reflective, like newly- molten lead.\" There was no illumination in the water, he noted. Thrush said he observed the object for 4% to 5 minutes. After he had taken two flash photos, during which the angle of the projection from the craft changed somewhat, the projection was re- tracted into the craft, and the object began mov- ing toward Thrush, \"Making several loud noises.\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"He described the sounds as \"not quite a thud, but sort of a clank. A metallic noise like someone hitting metal underneath the water.\" As the object began to move toward him, it changed to a pale bluish green around the bottom and lower sides. Thrush ran from the object after it came within 15 feet, but 'he stopped about 50 feet away, which he considered a safe dis- tance. The craft then passed about eight to ten feet over his car, and he said he heard it drop some objects, \"several being in the water, and one of which hit the hood of my car.\" He said he attempted to take another photo, a time exposure,, but \"my camera didn't take the shot because I was moving.\" The 1 object changed color as it picked up speed, .becoming'\"reddish-orange, then into the infra red spectrum\" as it left. He returned to his car and backed it up a few feet so that he could use his car lights and a flashlight to'search for the bojects he heard fall. \"I managed to find three metallic-like cin- ders or rocks on the ground,\" he said. One was about two feet from where the front of the auto had been, one three feet from the front, and one ten feet from the front. \"No rock exceeded 3/4 inch in diameter,-\" he said, and the car hood was not damaged. The rocks were initially identified locally as iron pyrite, but Thrush says that the rocks are \"much denser than iron pyrite,\" and do not have \"the same coloring or glitter effect. It wasn't until Dr. Doyle at- the University of South Florida looked at it that he proved that it was not iron pyrite.\" It was reported in the Santa Ana Register that another possible witness to the sighting was John Dowdy, 18, who was on the Morgan-Johnson Road a- bout two miles east of Thrush's location. Dowdy says he looked up and observed a \"bright orange object going really fast.\" The object turned southward, appeared to stop, then disappeared. In nearby Palma Sola Park, George Montgomery reportedly saw a strange light in the sky at a- bout the time of Thrush's sighting, according to the Register. The Register also noted that Thrush agreed to take a lie detector test, although there has been no information that this was done. Stan Friedman, physicist and noted UFO lec- turer, interviewed Thrush and obtained a sample of the rock, according to Skylook's West Coast coordinator Bob Kirkpatrick. Friedman does not yet have an analysis of the rock, which he des- cribes as resembling metallic slag. The St. Petersburg Times described the rocks as being warm and dry when found, but Thrush did not men-. tion this in his interview with Moyers. The St. Petersburg Times also reported that a preliminary investigation of the rocks by marine geologist Dr. Larry Doyle of the St. Petersburg branch of the University of Southern California indicated that they were cinders produced by an extreme heat source. He reportedly ' expressed an interest in doing a more extensive analysis. Thrush has been universally described in news stories as unusually brilliant. A former science fair winner, he reportedly did trigonometry and advanced algebra in the seventh grade. Bored with school, he dropped out to set up his own elec- tronics business. His knowledge of physics and his command of vocabulary appear to exceed that of most college graduates. He is an amateur pho- tographer who occasionally works as a profession- al, and he understands photographic printing and processing very well. Thrush says his background on UFO's was re- stricted to \"two popular books by Frank Edwards,\" and that he had never run into any reference to a projection or tube from a UFO. Kirkpatrick reports as an interesting sidelight that Thrush's mother told Friedman that three I credential-carrying government agents had visited [ Thrush and applied pressure on him not to talk a- bout the incident, then later withdrew the pres- sure. It is unknown whether she actually saw the individuals in question, or whether she was told [about them by Thrush.

The site has since been checked by Ted Phillips, MUFON secretary and landing trace specialist, but his findings were not available at press time. Phillips has collected soil samples for an- alysis, and additional soil samples have been sent to Walt Andrus by Spencer. Any addi- tional information will be printed as it be- comes available. Subject: UNKNOWN INDENTATION IN EARTH SURFACE Date: May 1, 1974 At 4:15 p.m. on April 29, 1974, Putnam County Sheriff Beutler called and asked if we would look at an unknown indentation in the earth surface. We agreed and called Walter H. Andrus Jr., who asked us to go ahead and help the sheriff, take pictures, and make measurments. At 4:40 p.m. the sheriff picked up the writer and drove to the Roy Hiltner farm located on Putnam County road 18A Section 6 Palmer Township, Ohio. . The location of the indentation is % mile west of county road 18, % mile south of county road A, ^ mile east of county road 19, and 3/4 mile north of county road B section 6 Palmer Twp. There are micro wave towers located 6 miles south on county road 19, another 4 miles north in Henry county, another 6 miles west. The Bowling Green University TV tower, which is over 800 ft. high, is\"located 10 miles directly to the east of the site. The indentation looks as though it was made by 7 legs or pods, with 2 round cylinder holes in the center of what appears to be an 8 foot circu- lar blast area. The 2 cylinder holes in the cen- ter seem to be bottomless. Using a 6 ft. prod the Putnam county engineers can push down with one finger and not touch the bottom. The 8 ft. blast area contains burned dirt which is very hard and crusted. On and around where the feet or pods were located the dirt has been blasted up 4 to 6 inches from the 8 ft. area of burned ground. Where the feet or pods were located the engineers pod had to be forced down, indicating the object that had been there was of considerable weight. The Putnam County engineers checked the area out for broken tile and found no tile in the area • if \\ of the indentation. The field had been plowed the first week of November, 1973, at an 8\" depth, and no one had been in the field until Tuesday, April 23, 1974. Then last Friday or Saturday Mr. Hilt- ner found the indentation and called the sheriff on Monday. The sheriff's department had UFO reports in that area last November as well as in the south- east part of the county. We talked to the people of the area and no one, including the Hiltner family, had seen anything around the Hiltner farms. The Hiltner family is very air minded and have two aircraft and a small air strip on their farm. We took soil samples on Monday from the blast area, from the pod area, and 1 1/8 mile south of the site in the field. The samples were taken to the Allen County Civil Defense office located in Lima, Ohio. The CD director, Mr. Frank Hempker, checked the soil for raioactivity and found none. However, radioactivity has only 1/10 life for every 7 hours and the indentation was possib- ly as old as 6 months, so any radioactivity could have dissipated. Hempker called the Ohio Adjutant General office at Columbus, and was referred to D. Redman, who made notes and advised the sheriff to contact the Public Affairs office at Lockborn Air Base, View of one of the possible pod indentations."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"View looking down at the two olyUnder holes in the center' of what appears to be a burned area.

Arkansas sighting reported HARRISON, ARK., DAILY TIMES, MARCH 27, 1974— Just after 8 p.m. on March 26,. Mrs. Nina Coffey, who lives one mile east of Bear Creek on Highway 14, went out to burn trash and noticed a bright light to the south. Her first impression was that Bear Creek Acres, had installed a new night light, but the light hovered for a minute, then turned \"real fast\" and moved southeast. Mrs. Coffey asked her 13-year-old son to bring binoculars, and when he returned the light had turned around and began . moving toward them. Her son,, Sammy, looked at the object through the binoculars and said, ''It's no plane.\" As Mrs. Coffey took the binoculars, the• light turned at a right angle _to the west. Looking through the binoculars .she could see the UFO from a side : view. She said it was cigar-shaped and at least 70 feet long, and not very far above the treetops.

We believe that such reports, when avail- able, are more valuable than several routine newspaper accounts, single witness sightings, and the like. This report and photo appear, in Skylook through the efforts of Joe Brill, International Coordinator. By Ernst Berger Representative for Austria LOCATION Traunstein in the Zwettl district is a small rural community on a range of hills overlooking the \"Highlands of Ottenschlag,\" a southern part of the \"Waldviertel Highlands\" in the northwest corner of Lower Austria. 911 meters over the Adriatic Sea level, Traunstein is surrounded by coniferous forests (beech, fir, and spruce fir trees), lakes, open fields and by littered bould- ers. The village of Traunstein is situated 8 kilometers NE of Mt. Weinsberg (1059 m high), which is covered by the Weinsberger Woods - a wild and sparsely populated area, 9 km W of Ottenschlag and 25 km SSW of the Allentsteig military operating ground near Zwettl (chief city) at the river Kamp, a deserted and cold region (one of Austria's \"zero degree poles\"). Industrial underdevelopment, \"landflight\" and a low population density in the Zwettl district make the Traunstein sightings a good example for Vallee's \"first negative law,\" though no land- ing was observed. WITNESSES Johann Pritz (age 21), the main witness of our case, is a compositor working for a printing office at Zwettl. His .brother Gerhard is a locksmith of 16 years. Both are intelligent country guys with good eyesight, somewhat taci- turn, but perfectly reliable in my opinion. To- gether with their mother they live in. a small farmhouse near a double bend in the minor road leading out of western Traunstein. WEATHER . • According to Vienna's Central Meteorological Station \"Hohe Warte\" a stable European high had full influence on Austrian weather throughout the night from October 28 to 29, 1973. The local weather report from Zwettl station reads: \"28.10. 19h - no clouds, calm, -2 deg, no precipitation. 29.10. 7h - clouds 1/8, calm, -6 deg, no precip- itation, minimum nighttime temperature -7 deg.\" It was a cold, starry night with excellent visi- bility, no moon after midnight, only Mars and Jupiter in the sky. FIRST SIGHTING Johann Pritz went to bed at 8:00 p.m. Central European Time and slept well until 0:30 a.m. on Monday, Oct. 29, when he started up. His friend .Karl Fichtinger was knocking at the bedroom win- dow. \"He wanted me to come out and look at an extraordinary thing in the southern sky. I dressed, went outdoors and there it was. You might have taken it for a star at first glance, but watching it more carefully you would see it was much nearer, giving off a different light and strange periodical light signals.\" Pritz got his 8x40 binoculars and aimed it at the \"star\" over the woods. It was \"some kind of luminous globe\" . with fuzzy edges, motionless at 9 degree elevation. The yellow-orange, light looked calm and steady, not dazzling, but \"restful to the eyes.\" \"The whole surface was shining brightly, you could hardly see it's shape. And it was artificial light, bright enough to catch your eye at once. But the striking detail was the signal.\" The so-called \"signal\" consisted of two beams of .\"curved light\" that were slowly projected up- wards from the main body. It was hard for Mr. Pritz to describe the details:. \"Well - it looked like snail feelers. The two yellow-orange beams came out--it was light, but it crept up slowly-- were projected upwards and bent outwards high up. Then it would stop progressing, the two tips turned faint green, some green mist fell down sideways and the rays were gone. You would wait for about 5 seconds and the game started again - extending, stopping, green, switch-off. Peri- odically.\" Pritz said the \"feelers\" were about 4 or 5 times the diameter of the fuzzy globe, but a goniometric test on the site later revealed he was rather underestimating, the length being 6-7 diameters. And they were not only high but perfectly clear, \"like two lines drawn with a piece of chalk, only dark sky between.\" The light wasn't solid, but it behaved like solid. Mr. Pritz had never seen anything the like. In our investigation I asked him to re-live both phases of interest \"in real time,\" first a bit too slowly, then a bit too quickly, and used my stop-watch for the test. We got 7-10 seconds for a complete \"extension\" and the tip turned yellow-green 2 or 3 seconds before \"switch-off.\" The second test for the dark phase showed a greater variance - the beams reappeared after 2-5 seconds. The maximum duration for a full period would be 15 seconds, which means at least 4 \"signals\" per minute. Pritz remembered also short beams shining downwards from the object's bottom constantly, and a slight shift of colors towards green and red on the edges (compare with second"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"-yeuow - A A \\ V - 3 Phases Domed Disc 4) sighting), but it was a minor effect and much more exposed to subjective errors. Pritz found no explanation for . what he was seeing. It was definitely no conventional air- craft or satellite, and a star with \"feelers\" would be hard to believe. \"We saw lots of shoot- ing stars that night (orionids and taurids), but we could tell the difference.. And; temperatures were low in the openr-we wouldn't stay there just for nothing. \"Fichtinger told me he'd first seen it around 11:30 p.m. on Sunday. He'd also shown it to neighbors (a couple).\" The .two friends decided to continue their watch. They went up to \"Wachtstein,\" passed the Catholic church of.Traunstein and stopped at a prospect point on the steep access road leading to the center of Traunstein, from where .you have a far-reaching view over the heavily wooded high- lands to the south'and east. Some minutes later they strolled down the access road, reached the minor road, walked around the double bend ap- proaching the Pritz.house and up to \"Wachtstein\" again. \"We kept that route for the rest of the night and tried to oversee what was goin' on up there. And there was something goin' on, believe me!\" At about 2:00 a.m. the object up in the south went into operation. Mr. Pritz watched carefully \"Suddenly a red dot, well, detached itself from the bottom of the globe and moved away to the east at breakneck speed--! don't think an air- craft would fly as fast. . (We saw-an Austrian military jet manoevering to the south in full daylight at the time of our investigation,.so Mr. Pritz knew what he was saying.) I kept my eyes glued to it, but suddenly it was. gone - the red light went out. Just a few moments later, the light flashed up again. It had changed to a bright yellow-orange, like the object up in the south, and started to give off the same strange signals. It really puzzled me.\" The trajectory was interesting - the red dot first did a vertical descent of 4 or 5 degrees, then it raced off towards Ottenschlag horizont- ally, stopped, disappeared, a fuzzy globe reap- peared, gave.off the first \"signals\" and descend- ed until it reached its final hovering point at 4 or 5 degrees elevation in the east. The red dot had no definite shape; it looked like an aircraft running light, but shone steadily in the color of carmine, as our color test revealed later. Pritz and Fichtinger arrived at the prospect point. Two objects were hovering in the.sky now: The possible \"mother ship\" in the south (Pritz wasn't sure whether the dot came out of it or from behind) and the \"missile\" over the Ottens- chlag region to the east Both objects continued their monotonous \"signals,\" so the friends looked away, turned to the west, and got their next shock. \"I would not believe my eyes. No. guess where that huge thing came from!\" The access road runs down into the southwest. The first house to the right after passing the prospect point is a two-storied country house with two pylons carrying electric cables over the rooftop. A dark object was hovering in the di- rection over pylon one. I asked Mr. Pritz to sketch it. He did with some hesitation: \"I'm no artist--you see, it was a flattened structure with a, well, it looked like an armoured turret of a tank, on top, but without a gun-barrel.\" He was drawing a classical domed disc. \"It was very near and I wasn't drunk, you know, I went to bed at 8:00 p.m. But we wouldn't believe our eyes any longer. I asked Karl: What are you seein 1 ? and he told me, that and that. I said yes, that's it, you see what I see. It must be true.\" Really a spectacular sight for two country guys who have never read a book on the topic, only sketchy press reports: The disc with its clearly"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"outlined upper rounding plus dome was hanging in the WSW at 17 degrees elevation (+_ 2°), enveloped in a diffuse yellowish light which seemed to come from behind. Its bottom line wasn't straight but curved and rather indistinct as the yellowish light reached peak brilliance there. The surface had a violet-black color and \"it surely was solid material, nothing fuzzy like the two others.\" But that wasn't all: from the dark cupola two \"feelers\" of curved light went up into the night sky, got greenish tips, vanished and came out a- gain at a stretch. \"It was the moment I thought, that's a guided operation! They're emitting the same light signals and belong together,\" Pritz said. He had no idea how far away the disc was, but it seemed \"close at hand.\" His goniometric test results gave us a diameter of 35 meters for the maximum distance, i.e. 2 kilometers. \"I was glad to have waited for such a long time. It was quite impressive and we didn't pay much attention to the eastern object anymore.\" Consequently' they failed to see the next ma- noevre there. Turning around after a while, Pritz and Fichtinger spotted three smaller globes near the \"missile,\" one to the left and two to the right,making up a \"chain\" with regular intervals. \"And they all gave off the same signals, all.at the same time.\" Full operation. Six objects were in the sky now: the domed disc to the WSW, the \"mother ship\" to the SSE, the \"missile\" to the east and three \"newcomers\" around it. All were' completely noiseless and a remark- able view, \"like bright mercury vapor street lamps. You would pass a house or a group of trees and lose sight of it, but find them again at a glance. Maybe a hoax, but it looked as if they were all standing at the same altitude, but only in the southern hemisphere. We searched the northern sky and found.nothing.\" I examined his idea afterwards and must say it wasn't irrational: suppose the disc hovered 2km away at 500 m altitude (=17 ) and the other ob- jects kept the same level, the \"missile! 1 would be 6 km away, right over the railroad track Zwettl- Martinsberg and near the Ottenschlag crossing, whereas the \"mother-ship's distance would be 3km. 3:00 a.m. was near. A lonely car came down the road, but it did not stop and kept to a certain route, like the two friends. \"He was drivin' the same stretch again and again. We couldn't see the reason why.\" Somewhat later two persons ap- proached. \"We tried to show to them what was goin' on, but they were pretty blue and called us nuts.\" And the two \"nuts\" remained the only wit- nesses, no matter how they tried to catch others' attention. \"We would knock at doors and try to wake someone up, but nobody cared. Maybe they took us for drunkards or burglars and, well, you see, a highland village isn't the safest spot -at 3:00 a.m. Finally we gave it up.\" The six objects \"signalled\" on and on. Beam up, a tinge of green, mist, beam off. At about 3:30 a.m. the \"missile\" moved again. The-\"signal\" stopped, the yellow-orange light went out, the The above photo shows the location of the Oct. 28-29 sighting at Traunstein'. The author has red dot appeared, descended-and dashed away, now into the opposite direction, to the south. \"First .1 thought, look, it's flying back to the big one (the \"mother ship\"), but it passed under it and went off into the west at dizzying speed.

'They went to the south a little, stopped for a long while, moved again, and so on.\" At 4:30 a.m. on Oct. 29—five hours of obser- vation for Fichtinger, four for Pritz--the friends decided to go home. The three globes had travelled to the southeast and kept their alti- tude and formation at 150 azimuth, in the direc- tion over a barn. The \"mother ship\" and the domed disc were still motionless. Pritz said good-bye to Fichtinger and went to the porch of his house. \"I looked up to the sky a last time and. all was to be seen very clearly. It was Monday morning, a working day, so I entered the house and went to bed again. But I couldn't sleep and when I looked out at 6:00 a.m.(about 30 minutes before sunrise) they were gone.\" From the first moment of Fich- tinger 's watch until 4:30 a.m. the \"mother ship\" had given off at least 1200 \"signals.\" The domed disc emitted 550 and the \"missile\" 360 (minimum). Things took their usual course: Pritz told his colleagues at the printing-office about the hair-rising night and-they phoned the editor of \"Zwettler Nachrichten\" (the local newspaper). Pritz \"was interviewed for '\"Landesrundschau,\" a weekly transmission of Oesterreich Regional (second program of the Austrian Radio and Televi- sion Company \"ORF\").

Meanwhile the story had reached KUHIER, a popular Vienna paper, and they published the negative comment of a second astronomer. \"Zwettler Nachrichten\" contributed one of the most stupid articles I ever read and the discussion cooled off until mid-November. We had arranged for a field investigation with Mr. Pritz on Nov. 18, 1973, and drove to Traun- .stein that fine Sunday morning. Snow had fallen over the Waldviertel Highlands in the meantime and it was difficult to keep the car on the icy road. At 10 past 10 a.m. we reached the Pritz house. We were late and Mr. Pritz was already waiting for us in his green Volkswagen. \"Good morning! It's fine you're coming today. We've seen it again yesterday evening. I wonder are we goin' crazy or what is it?\" he said,a bit shaken. To our b.iggest surprise we had arrived for a \"near hot-line investigation.\" A multiple witness sighting had taken place only 15 hours before our arrival at Traunsteih. It was a chance we never had before. The second incident was .fresh in their memories and we concentrated on the four main witnesses (basically our regular investi- gation time was calculated for the first sighting alone, not for interviews with 10 persons). SECOND SIGHTING Weather was fine in the evening of Nov. 17, 1973. An outlier of the British.high.had reached Central Europe in the morning and precipitation ceased in Lower Austria. (The last snowfall at Traunsteih had been on Friday.) The.local weather report from Zwettl station runs: \"17.11. 19h - no clouds, wind NW 24 kmh, 1 deg, no precipitation, maximum daytime temperature 4 deg.\" Sunset took (Photo provided by Ernst Ber^r Brill, International Cooridinatcr. ) through .Joe place at about 4:15 p.m. GET. Shortly after 6:00 p.m. Johann Pritz was on his way home from a visit at Arbesbach. (15 km NNW of Traunstein) driving his Volkswagen along .the minor road Schoenbach-Traunstein. Between Schoen- bach and Ullrichschlag the road is southbound running towards the vast Weinsberger Woods before a bend-off to the east. \"Suddenly it struck my eyes. Something was hanging low over the treetops in a southern, direction. I looked at it, an oblong, flattened shape standing on end, giving off the same peculier light signals. I said No, it can't be true! and looked away.\" After his radio interview and press publicity Johann had been exposed to heavy ridicule in his small community: \"They said we had been drunk or crazy, seein' things. It's 'enough for you to see such a thing, your reputation doesn't \"courtt. The whole press story was no advantage for me. People are highly skeptical and only a few showed their interest. So I thought it over. Should I say anything about the new object? Deepen my 'madness'? After , all I stopped near Ullrich- schlag, left the car and watched it for a while. It was there, over, the woods, and the signals were the same. I went on.\" ' . ' The car reached Traunstein at about 6:15 p.m. and Pritz stopped • at . . his house to get the bi- noculars. His mother was watching TV and Johann told her to look out. of the living room-window. Ke found his -8x40 field glass and went outdoors again, where he met Gerhard and his friend Erich Leitgeb. The four watched it for a while. Mrs. Pritz came to the window, before she returned to the TV set, and Johann trained. his binoculars on it. He had made up his mind what to do next. \"We jumped into the car and drove into the center to get some additional witnesses, immediately. I 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"knew nobody would believe our story without a back-up.\" Fifteen minutes later Johann had found six re- spectable persons: Josef Habegger (owner of the local department store), his wife, a third person from the store 1 , Karl Fichtinger and Leopold Wag- ner. Karl Teuschl, the local tobacconist, had promised to join them after driving his car to the garage (which he did). The nine persons took their stand near telephone pole two on the minor road before the double bend. It proved to be a good observation point: the object was hovering some distance away (no estimation possible) at 5 +1 elevation and 200/210 azimuth in the direc- tion of a depression in the treeline. Now they had time to observe the manoevres more precisely. \"I'd say it was even more peculiar than any- thing we'd seen the first night,\" Johann said. The main body .was oblong and shining in a bright yellow-orange color. The light seemed to orig- inate at the outer surface. According to our goniometric test the diameter would have been 32 meters at a distance of 2,5 kilometers. Was it the domed disc again, now standing on end? Mrs. Habegger used a field glass, too. But it just wasn't necessary—you would see enough with the naked eye, every detail. Two \"feelers\" were clearly visible among some \"minor feelers\" (less high and prominent) and in permanent operation, as usual. Their height was enormous, about 80 meters at the supposed dis- tance, high as a church tower, (about 2 40' in the night sky, i.e. five times the full moon). A second variation was the permanent shift of colors on the left and right side of the main body, \"some kind of color fusion,\" as Johann put it. The light turned \"a sparkling red\" at the left, then it vanished and a \"yellowish green\" appeared at the right, vanished and the whole process started again. Later, Johann described the third and most spectacular variation: \"Suddenly :the signals would stop and the whole body would shrink away. It was, well, like letting the air out of a toy balloon: the light dimmed, turned red more and more, as if it would cease glowing, burn out, and the whole thing nearly shrinked into nothing. But a few moments before the end it would blow itself up, rapidly, gradually resume its yellow-orange light and the feelers would come out again.\" Wheras the \"signal\", i. e. the \"feelers,\" followed the old pattern of Oct. 28/29 (7-10 seconds \"projection\", green tips, 2-5 seconds darkness etc.), the \"shrinking and blowing-up process\" had a different frequency: the \"Shrink- ing\" took 3-7 seconds (\"real time test\" done with Gerhard and Johann) and the \"blowing-up\" was done faster. Both processes, you see, had their fixed duration, but the \"fully- blown-up state\" between two \"dim-and-brighten processes\" had not. \"You would look at it a minute or so, 'til it shrinked away again, but sometimes it signalled ' for two minutes or the like,\" Gerhard remembered. Johann and his mother nodded consent. No sound was heard during the whole observation. Whatever it was, the \"Traunstein object number seven\" carried out one of the most complex, in- teresting and apparently senseless missions I ever heard of, and it was a pleasure to investi- gate the sighting only hours after its end. Im- agine the inevitable confusion and contradictions in the four person-interview, had the investiga- tion taken place weeks later! 7:00 p.m. passed by. The crowd stood and stared in head-shaking silence. \"Look, it's dis- appearing again!\" they said to each other, now and then. Johann remembered he had promised the editor of \"Zwettler Nachrichten\" -to phone him im- mediately, \"shbuld the thing come again.\" \"I told them, I'll go and ring up the editor, but don't forget to say you have seen it, too! and drove to the nearest telephone in the center.\" Meanwhile the TV play had finished and Mrs. Pritz decided to watch \"the program outside.\" The group at the other side of the double bend scattered, only Gerhard Pritz and his friend Erich stood and observed the object. \"It blinked again red and green, shrinked, until it was small and blood red, the disc put up and \"set\" very slowly,\" Gerhard told us. \"Yes, it sunk into the woods at a sloping course,\" Leitgeb added. Mrs. Pritz saw it, too. \"About four min- utes later it was gone.\" The two guys started to run into the center, where Johann was still try- ing to ring up the editor, who wasn't at home, in fact. \"They came and told me, It's gone! had I known it before, I'd-never gone away to the tele- phone.\" The object had disappeared at 7:15 p.m. and the two friends now returned home, where they talked with Mrs. Pritz about the observation. She was concerned about it: \"It was eerie. Is a new war goin' to happen?\" At our arrival, discussions among the Pritz family were still going on. Johann had decided not to inform the editor about the new sighting. \"It's no good for us.\" And we got a first (and last) impression of \"public attitudes\" at Traun- stein: our measurements at the access road caused a jolly good laugh in a nearby house. \"Let 'em \"laugh,\" Johann said, I know, what I have seen.\" And his brother confessed: \"I also made fun of it, you see, 'til yesterday evening \" COMPARATIVE PHENOMENOLOGY The Traunstein \"snail feelers\" 'are a rare pat- tern,. but no novelty, as we were to find out by searching our records for similar cases. Remember the excellent Taize report by Mr. Lagarde, GIDR (a translation appeared in Flying Saucer Review (FSR) July-August 1973, p.16): The torchlight cone of a witness in the field was \"deflected\" by a strange \"hedge\" on August 18, 1972, and beams of light shining down from the main object looked like \"pylons,\" i.e. solid.

It appeared to expand and contract... When large the light appeared brighter, and when small dimmer. The same shafts of green light ex- tended from the base of the object.

However, NBC News is very aware of the tremendous interest in the subject and has now scheduled a one-hour documentary on UFO's to be viewed this fall on Saturday evening during \"prime time.\" Craig Leake, an NBC News writer/producer, has been assigned to this ambitious undertaking. On April 20, Craig flew to Quincy from New York City and spent from 10:00 a.m. to 10:30p.m. with MUFON personnel discussing plans and ideas for producing this film for TV. He had spent the prior day with Dr. J. Allen Hynek in Evari 1 ston, Illinois. We have suggested to Craig that the documentary film have as its format the positive scientific activities that are taking place at the present time to resolve the UFO phenomenon. This will include the work of Dr. Hynek and the Center for UFO Studies in Northfield, Illinois, MUFON, APRO, and NICAP as the major UFO organizations in the' U.S.A., some solid UFO cases filmed at the scene, and other MUFON functions, starting with the UFO Symposium at Akron, Ohio, the UFO course being taught by Professor E. J. Planz at the University of Alabama, and the MUFON Picnic at Carlyle Lake. We look forward to working with Craig and the NBC film crew when they -come to Akron and Quincy to film some of the MUFON sequences. As more de- tails develop, we will keep SKYLOOK .readers in- formed on the film progress, including the \"show date and time.\" Special symposium meeting scheduled on humanoids MUFON members Ted Bloecher and Dave Webb would like to solicit the participation of SKYLOOK readers in the collection and analysis of humanT oid reports (when these beings are clearly as- sociated with UFOs they are called occupants.) If there is enough interest, a Working Group may be established. Ted has probably the .world's most complete collection of humanoid reports; Dave is working on a report analyzing the Fall, 1973, wave of humanoid reports in the U.S. Both members plan to attend the June .22 Symposium in Akron, Ohio, and would like to meet with those interested in this aspect of the UFO phenomenon. They plan to hold an informal dis- cussion session during the noon to 1:30 p.m. lunch break on Saturday, the 22nd. The location will be announced at the meeting.

The following information concerning this . . case was provided by .Professor Calin Turcu of Valenii de Munte, Romania and Mikai Matei via articles they have authored on this in- cident in various Romanian publications. Between the hours of midnight and 01:00 hrs. of the night of September 27th-28th, 1972, an un- identified flying object was sighted• near the city of Posesti in the Prahova district of Ro- mania. The lone witness to this appearance was a night watchman of the C.A.P. Company, of Posesti. His name is Vasile Carabus and at the time of the sighting he was located on the slope of Tabacioi Hill, which is directly south of the village of Valea Plopului. His location that night was one and a half miles southeast of the purposed land- ing site. What Mr. Carabus observed was as follows: \"I saw a bright object in the sky, like a very bright star with a tail. This object had a di- ameter slightly larger than Venus and a burning tail of about two meters when it moved. I first noticed it in the northeast sky and after being stationary for a short while it began to descend slowly at a forty-five degree angle until it dis- appeared from my sight at a place called La Odaia. During the entire time I watched this thing I heard no sound at all, nor were the ani- mals in the area disturbed; \"I didn't pay much attention to this event.-and I didn't mention to anyone what I had seen. It was not until three days later ;that I heard the news about the markings and the blown ground that was found at La Odaia. That is what made me de- cide to tell what I had seen as there might have been some connection involved.\" The first to discover the strange markings and disturbed ground, were the people of Valea Plopului. The area is cultivated with corn and some apple trees. Professor Turcu and two local farmers Aurel Dumitru and Vasile Nicolae examined the site. Also Professor Elena Nedeiea and her students found this site .while on an agricultural practice, and they were puzzled by what they found. After the site had been visited and trampled on by several hundred people, the .autumn rains came and it was not until November 28th of that same year that a serious .investigation was be- gun. The first photographs of the markings were taken on December 1st of that year. It is a real tragedy that two full months had /.A ODAIA TREE passed since the initial \" sighting and discovery of the site to when a serious investigation was started. . . What was found at this site was as follows: The corn stalks were crushed to the ground and torn to pieces, They ,were thrown radially around giving the impression that whatever crushed the stalks was probably rotating at a high speed either in landing or taking off or both. There were three trapezoid -shaped depressions found. Each was 1.5 meters in length and each was exactly 120 degrees from the others.. It was estimated that the weight of the object which was supported on those three traces found was at least, several.tons, but it was impossible to de- termine if this ground impact was the result of only the weight of, the object itself, or because of the impact made in the landing or take off. There is no trace of any burnt or scorched areas at the site. . Even though the ground at the site is quite inclined, the area which is bordered by the de- pressions ,was torn . and settled to make a hori- zontal platform between two power lines of high voltage. -These high voltage lines are located each at 135 meters from the site. One is direc- tly to the north while the other is directly to the south. Both lines run east and west.. . The site is 200 meters north of a country road that connects Posesti with Starchiojd.

In the very center of this circle is a hole which is carrot shaped. It has a diameter of 14 centimeters across the surface opening and extends down 2 meters to a point. Could this center hole have been made by. some type of grounding or soil sample analyzation de- vice? The radius from the edge of the center hole to the trapezoid depressions all measure equally. Each measures exactly 2.20 meters as shown on the sketch. The site is situated in an area which is bord- ered by -three apple trees. Two are 5 meters and one is 7 meters distance from the center hole. In the information I have secured on this case there is no mention of any damage or deterioration to any of the three trees on the perimeter of the site. Lastly is the fact that there was. a light radi- ation at this site. The radioactivity detected was gamma rays. The reading was 8 milliroentgen per hour. This is a light radioactivity, but the question remains, why is there any in such a re- mote location as this is. Gamma rays are known to be very penetrable and for this reason the propulsion systems we employ in space launches do not give off any such radiation. What was at this site did.and it registered on the geiger-counter used there. Did an extra-terrestrial spacecraft land at La Odaia? I cannot say for sure, but one thing is positive*, the evidence was there that compares to other such findings from around the globe.Another piece for the puzzle which is slowly beginning to give us a glimpse of the entire picture. Outstanding speakers announced for Carlyle Sky watch, picnic A group of outstanding speakers and activity leaders will be on hand for the Sixth Annual UFO Skywatch and Picnic July 20 and 21 at the Boulder Access to Carlyle Lake, Carlyle, 111. The Skywatch will kick off the weekend, start- ing at dusk on Saturday. Dr. Willard P. Armstrong will direct the observations, and he will appre- ciate having volunteers assist with their energy and equipment (short-wave, walkie-talkies, etc.) in setting up communication posts around the lake. Those interested in helping should contact him at 6908 Kingsbury, St. Louis. John Preisack, assistant director of the McDonnell Planetarium in St. Louis, will assist with astronomical ques- tions and give a talk. Weather permitting, sky- viewing will continue through the night for those interested in participating. The all-day picnic will get underway promptly at 10 a.m., with the morning to be spent in soci- alizing. Those wishing to eat with the group should bring a contribution to the potluck din- ner. Speakers for the picnic scheduled thus far in- clude Lucius Parish, who writes for Skylook, Saga, Fate, and other publications; Clarence 0. Dargie, retired Air Force master sergeant and UFO lecturer; and Walt Andrus, MUFON director. The - Boulder Access is located northeast of Carlyle, 111., on the Boulder-Ferrin Road. Arrows will mark the way from the Boulder-Ferrin Road sign on Highway 50 (approximately 8 miles east of Carlyle). A map of the area may be obtained by sending a stamped, self-addressed envelope to Rosetta Holmes, 1690 Hill Drive, Carlyle, 111. 62231. . The Boulder Access area is known for its rec- reational facilities, including camping, swimming boating, hiking, and skiing. Mrs. Holmes notes that there is \"a beautiful wooded area\" surround- ing the Shelter House. Mrs. Holmes stresses that \"everyone\" is in- vited. \"You do not have to be a member of any UFO group to attend,\" she says. Last year more than 200 persons participated in the weekend event. An Afgan made by Mrs. Holmes will be raffled off at the picnic in order to raise funds for a PA system for the picnic and other UFO uses. A portable radio has also been donated by Frank Brown for the drawing. Tickets for the drawing are $1.00 each by mail from Dot Christian, 758 Lemay Ferry Road, Lemay, Mo., 63125. Checks for the $1.00 donation should be made out to UFO Study Group. Tickets will also be available at the June Symposium in Akron and at . the picnic.'

The May 5 issue told of sightings over New Brunswick, Canada. Reports of Minnesota sightings were given in the May 19 issue, along with seeress Jeane Dixon's views on UFOs. Her present statements represent quite an \"about- face,\" considering that she has previously said UFOs were secret experimental devices of Earthly origin. Now she says they are from a \"hidden planet\" ini our solar system, crewed by women. One wonders if this \"new revelation\" might have anything to do with Mrs. Dixon's supposedly forthcoming book on UFOs? The ENQUIRER issue of May 26 featured the Florida \"mystery sphere\" which has been receiving so much publicity of late.

The Earley article on lasers and UFOs is perhaps the most interesting of the three.      ,\" An article by Dr. Andrija Puharich (Uri Gel- ler's biographer) in the May/June issue of PSY- CHIC outlines the various types of extrater- restrial beings who are supposedly communicating with Geller and Puharich. Stuart Nixon, formerly with NICAP, contributes an article on UFO sightings by astronauts in the June issue of FATE. This is both incomplete and somewhat misleading, so it is not the best sum- mary of such reports which has seen print. An excellent article on. military encounters with UFOs is found in the June issue of SAGA. The authors are Stanton T. Friedman and B. Ann Slate, always a winning combination. John Keel's regular column is also in this issue. Tommy .Roy Blann has an article on recent Texas UFO reports in the Summer issue of PROBE THE UN- KNOWN.  . .       '. . The July issue of .PSYCHIC DIMENSIONS contains an interview with Erich von Daniken, but.little new information is included. TRUE magazine is now offering $5,000 for proof of burnings, blindings or other injuries caused by UFOs. Recent paperback reprints of older UFO books include Renato Vesco's INTERCEPT--UFO (originally titled INTERCEPT—BUT DON'T SHOOT) and John G. Fuller's THE INTERRUPTED JOURNEY. William R. Corliss has recently begun a project which will be of great value to both UFO and,..For- tean researchers. Mr. Corliss proposes-to publish a series of sourcebooks on unusual natural phe.- nomena, ancient man and other themes of .a similar nature. His first two volumes, STRANGE PHENOMENA and STRANGE ARTIFACTS, are now available. Addi- tional volumes are in preparation. STRANGE PHE-, NOMINA. probably contains more material which/ would appeal to the Ufologist, as it'includes re- ports .of nocturnal lights, meteor-like phenomena,, ball\" lightning, light wheels in the sea, etc., a- long with many other types of unexplained events. STRANGE ARTIFACTS will be of interest to those persons interested in the \"ancient astronauts\" theme, as it contains material on ancient con- structions, legends § myths, \"erratics\" and other such topics. Most of the data are taken from scientific journals dating back into the 1800's (or earlier, in some cases), although some more recent accounts are also included. Mr. Corliss has acted as a compiler and has added his com- ments where appropriate. Many of the sources are the same as those used by Charles Fort, although these are the complete accounts, rather than just short excerpts. The two books are available'for $6.95 each from Mr. Corliss at Box 107, Glen Arm, MD 21057. They are highly recommended. I suppose the phrase, \"interpretation of evi- dence,\" would best sum up James M. McCampbell's book, UFOLOGY. Mr. McCampbell has surveyed UFO literature and analyzed UFO characteristics in an attempt to \"come to grips with the physical nature of the UFO phenomenon,\" as Dr. J. Allen Hynek puts it. Both Dr. Hynek and Dr. Jacques Vallee have praised the book. The evidence is broken down into such categories as electrical interference, physiological effects, flight and propulsion, pilots and passengers, activities on Earth, etc. McCampbell feels there is no need to reach into the esoteric realms of hypothetical \"parallel universes\" to explain UFO activities. To his credit, he proposes re-examination of old- er, more controversial aspects of Ufology, such as the contactee cases. This has been long need- ed and it is good to see an author of McCamp- bell 's stature who is aware of this need. . His proposals for future UFO research are also of considerable interest. UFOLOGY is certainly one of the better books to be published in recent years. \"It may be obtained for .$3.95 in paper- back ($10.00 in hardcover) from: Jaymac Co.,12 Bryce Court, Belmont, CA 94002. 16"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Around the Network Director- John F. Schuessler of the UFO Study Group of Greater St. Louis announced at the April 21 meeting that he will be forced to resign as president of the St. Louis group, as he is be- ing transferred to the Johnson Space Center near Houston, Texas, by his employer.McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co. In Houston, Mr. Schuessler will be working with the astronauts in the crew sys- tems division of the space shuttle program. Vice President Bill Christian noted that since the St. Louis group was formed and since Mr. Schuessler has been the main sparkplug behind it, the UFO has been made a respectable subject for public discussion. In other action at the meeting, several recent UFO reports from the St. Louis area were discus- sed. Two members of the group, Miss Marlies Dom- broska and Mr. Thomas Mulligan, observed two red lights on the evening of March 24 for about five minutes from different locations in Lemay. These remain unexplained. Three teenage girls reported seeing two cyl- inder-type objects flying parallel in a clear blue sky at 2:45 p.m. April 9 over a residential area southwest of St. Louis. This sighting also remains unexplained. Several calls were received which were traced to sightings of an advertising airplane, which, when viewed from a distance, presented a classic \"flying saucer\" image, having a configuration of an illuminated disc (viewed edge on) with either a red or green light at each end. Chief Investigator Leo F. Wicklinski discussed his investigation of a reported sighting by three adults in Illinois near St. .Louis which involved a bright light, \"a tingling sensation\" on the part of one'witness, and a description of the ob- ject which included seven \"windows\" in the dome section of the object. In, other action, the formation of a new sub- committee was announced by the Rev. John Schro- eder. This subcommittee will concentrate on re- ports of psychic and paranormal phenomena associ- ated with UFO experiences. It will be headed by Board member Cliff Palmberg.

A course entitled \"UFO's: A Scientific Ap- proach\" was taught May 13 through May 31 at the University of Alabama by Professor E. J. Planz, associate professor of metallurgical engineering and MUFON State Director for Alabama. The course included such topics as history of ufology, clas- sic UFO sightings, organizations and publications in ufology, collaborators and non-collaborators in ufology, and the scientific approach. The presentations included use of slides, • photos, tapes, and films. Dr. J. Allen Hynek's book, \"The UFO Experience, A Scientific Enquiry,\" was used as the basic text. MUFON symposium proceedings and other materials were also used-in the course. Speakers scheduled for the course included Dr. Hynek; Professor George Toffel, Department of Chemistry, University of Alabama, anti-gravity; Dr. Horace Washburn, professor emeritus of the Department of Finance, University of Alabama, sociological and psychological effects; Sheriff Fred Diamond of Pascagoula, Miss., the Pascagoula case; Edward Brown, news bureau, University of Alabama, the Condon Report; and Dr. Robert White- hurst, Department of Physics, University of Ala- bama, object size measurements in space. Also scheduled was a trip to the Meyer Planetarium at Birmingham-Southern College to familiarize stud- ents with celestrial bodies that could be mis- taken for UFO's. Professor Plantz :acknowledges Dr. Arlen R. Zander of East Texas State Univer- sity, Dr. Thornton Page, NASA, Johnson Space Center, and Dr. Robert F. Greegan of the State University of New York at Albany for their ' as- sistance in putting the course\" together.' ******* The \"International Symposium\" on UFO's held May 9 at McDonnell Planetarium in St. Louis drew an audience of about 400, according to Dave. Schroth, and about 50 latecomers had to be turn- ed away. John Schuessler and Guillermo Aldunati, from Argentina, were the featured speakers. Aldunati was featured on two TV interviews. Portholes, spinning object reported SCRANTON, PA., TRIBUNE, FEB. 25, 1974--A UFO with flashing red . lights and what may have been portholes was spotted over East Mountain by six city policemen shortly before dawn Feb. 24. The object was first sighted at 5:50 a.m., appearing as a very bright stationary object in the sky with red lights on the side similar to aircraft identification or \"running\" lights. Patrolman Donald Decker said he saw the object move north- ward, then stop. Patrolmen Eugene Walsh and Anthony Pica viewed the object through binoculars and reported it was spinning and appeared to have portholes. Patrolman Thomas McGinnis said the object became difficult to see as the sky grew brighter and created a light background. 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Southeast Missouri's Dr. Harley Rutledge To resume on-site summer research This summer, Dr. .Harley D. Rutledge, head of the Physics Department at Southeast Missouri State University, will resume full-time investi- gation in the area of Piedmont, Mo., in an effort to explain, the many sightings of mysterious lights in that section of southeast Missouri.Dr. Rutledge, who has studied the sightings since February of 1973, could not have been character- ized as \"pro-UFO\" before beginning his investi- taion, which was partially financed by the St. Louis Globe-Democrat. After studying the lights, however, Dr. Rutledge seems to believe there is something there that cannot,as yet, be explained. Nevertheless-, he is still understandably reluc- tant to publicly draw conclusions as to what the lights may be. A team of scientists and advanced science students, led by Dr. Rutledge, documented more than 100 sightings during a three-month period of observations last summer. In reporting this ac- tivity, Dr. Rutledge concluded the following: --The objects are able to maneuver at speeds estimated at thousands of miles an hour. --They are able to make right-angle turns at speeds that would crush conventional aircraft. --The objects are of .a variety of shapes, ranging from cylindrical to bell and bullet forms. --The lights can blink.on or off at will. The color of the lights varies from red, blue and amber to bright white. In some cases the lights produce the effect of popping strobe lights of great intensity. --At times the objects appear to have intel- ligent control and seem to • follow prearranged flight paths. --The objects seem to be propelled by a power not yet harnessed by man, possibly ion or mag- netic energy.   • Rutledge says that at least $5,000 is needed for a continuation of the investigation this sum- mer, and he has appealed to interested groups and individuals to' make tax exempt contributions to Project Identification, Business Office, South- east Missouri State University, Cape Girardeau, Mo. 63701. He notes that he has contributed more than $500 of his own money to the project thus far. His plans for this summer include the use of more sophisticated equipment for tracking the lights, as well as a thorough search of the ter- rain where some observers have reportedly seen objects land and depart. He says he would like to eventually set up a statewide system of train- ed observers to report the movements of the ob- jects. Following are excerpts from an interview with Dr. Rutledge by KMOX radio, St. Louis, Mo., on March 26, 1974, as compiled by David A. Schroth of the Greater St. Louis UFO Study Group: On anomalous lights in southeastern Missouri: RUTLEDGE: \"....I have discounted most explan- ations (for such phenomena).whether scientific or otherwise, because of the plethora of different sightings--the different types of things that we have seen. You just aren't going to come up with a simple explanation.\" KMOX: \"....So you're not prepared to say what they are; you're just saying that there's some- thing down there.\" RUTLEDGE: \"I say that there is something there, we have evidence for it, it's mysterious, and we are measuring its That's as far as I can go.. physical properties. \"....Strictly speaking, we are putting scien- tific equipment in the field. There is something there to measure, we can prove it, and we don't want to go too much further than that.... \"....In several instances, I've seen what I thought were stars in the sky, and it turned out that they were not stars. They were at rest/ In some cases, they moved; in some cases, they switched off \" On size and sound: RUTLEDGE: \"....We have made a size determin- ation in a case or two. One of the objects that we have categorized is a double-light: you have a fore light and an aft light, and some kind of a fuselage connecting them. We can see this at night. You can see this all the way across the sky. There are no other lights to it, but we do believe there's a fuselage connecting, and we have made a measurement of this--of course, an indirect measurement--of about 13 feet....\" KMOX: \" Any sounds?\" RUTLEDGE: \"I have had, I would guess, over a hundred sightings on the 99 nights that I've been out, and I've never heard any sound, to date.\" _ KMOX: \"You personally have made about a hun- dred sightings?\" ' RUTLEDGE: \"Yes.\" KMOX\" \"Are UFOs a natural existence or source in the universe, or are they of a supernatural nature that we are able, now and then, to visual- ize?\" 18"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"RUTLEDGE: \"That's a .very difficult question for me to answer.

McKay has sent a report and news clippings on which the following is based: After five months of allegedly observing UFO's around Boshkung Lake, near Minden, Ontario, Can- ada, Mr. and Mrs. Ashley Lunham, who live near the lake, have called for an investigation by the Department of National Defense. There have been UFO reports by realtors, a private pilot, a news- paper reporter, and others, but the chief witnes- ses seem to be Mr. and Mrs. Lunham, who live a- cross the road from the lake, and have clear view of it. Mrs. Lunham, 75, has written a very long report of her alleged sightings for McKay. The Lunhams claim the objects,which are a dirty brown or black color, have visited the lake every day since Nov. 12, 1973. They described the UFO's as cigar-shaped and kite-shaped, with amber, red, blue, green and white lights. The Lunhams say the objects have as many as nine antenna each, and appear to signal each other with some sort of code of flashing lights. The most striking experience reported by Mrs. Lunham allegedly occurred one night in February when the temperature was 20 degrees below 'zero. She says they saw a UFO • arrive over the lake, then turn towards their house. About half way a- cross the lake the UFO turned on a light beam which struck the window of the house. \"The frost melted in seconds,\" said Mrs. Lunham, \"and one could smell the wood in the window still getting hot. The glass was so hot I could not touch it to wipe off the melted frost-.\" The Lindsay,.Ontario, 'Daily Post of March 14, 1974, pictured a staff member indicating the po- sition of a triangular formation depressed in'the snow by an alleged UFO.

The photo experiment involved Geller holding photographer Yale Joel's camera, with a lens 'cap taped over the lens, pointed at his own forehead. The object of the experiment was to \"photograph\" an image in Geller's-mind,.which was to be picked up from Joel's son, Seth, seated across the room. Seth was to concentrate on a photo of an eagle. Thus the camera was supposed to photograph the image of an eagle picked up by Geller's mind. After this session, Joel and his son were asked to leave the rpom in order for Geller to attempt another psychic experiment, and the camera was left with Geller. Later the film in the camera was developed and an image was seen on the film. Instead of. an eagle, however, there was 'an image which a number of professional photog- raphers unhesitatingly described as a portrait of Geller made with the lens cap being held in front of the lens (apparently by Geller), thus blocking out most of the photo. Joel easily duplicated the photo, and concluded: \"Uri, I'm. sorry to say the consensus of expert photographic opinion, including my own (after due reflection) is that your lens cap is showing. '(I mean my lens cap.) You really didn't reckon with the ex- treme depth of field of the extreme wide-angle 160-degree 17-mm Takumar f/4 'fisheye' lens. Be- sides, what the hell happened to the eagle?\" The photos accompanying•the Popular Photography article explain the experiment fully. In the general article, Reynolds, an experi- enced reporter of psychic phenomena and magic, described his research on Geller for Time Maga- zine. Reynolds was accompanied by James Randi, a magician and psychic debunker. He indicates that in one demonstration Geller peeked at arm motions in order to \"read\" what some Time staffers were drawing on pads, and that the \"psychic\" missed when Randi hid his pencil motions from Geller. - Reynolds likewise said that Geller was observed bending a fork and a key with his hand, rather than with his mind, while the attention of most of the observers was on something else. While Reynolds acknowledges that Geller is able to ascertain the contents of sealed envelopes during his performances, Reynolds says that many performers, including Randi, can successfully do this. Reynolds notes that Geller's performances calling for the bending of nails or spikes in- volve the consistent use of nails or spikes which have been taped together, and that 'this could al- low for a pre-bent nail or spike to be included. Reynolds says that two of Geller's biggest TV failures occurred when he had had no opportunity to handle the props beforehand. This occurred on the Johnny Carson show, where Carson, an amateur magician, had called Randi before the show and been advised by Randi to Keep Geller away from 'the props. Another failure occurred on the Joyce Brothers show when Dr. Brothers insisted on using the nails she had brought in her purse, rather than the set wrapped in tape. Reynolds says that Geller recently - cancelled lucrative appearances in Europe and America, and that his manager was unhappy with performances in New York and Miami where- Geller's results were not impressive. Said the manager, \"The audience at both settings was packed with magicians and they were both a disaster.\" 'Reynolds asks in his article, \"If Uri is a genuine psychic, why should he be unwilling to perform for magicians?\" Reynolds suggests that perhaps magicians would be more adept than scientists (i.e. the Stanford Research Institute experiment) in determining Geller's\" psychic abilities. In a pro-Geller article by John M. Cathcart in one of the national tabloids, .Geller's mother makes much of the fact that Geller, at age 10, on the island of Cyprus, had found his way to a -hospital from his room in another part of the city. \"The child had never been in Cyprus before, and spoke no language that was commonly under- stood there,\" she said. The article did not ex- plain why Geller would not have been familiar with English, since he. is from Tel Aviv, Israel, which was formerly British. If he .did know Eng- lish, he was certainly familiar with a language . commonly used in Cyprus, since it_was also form- erly British. Although Geller is presented favorably in an article by his biographer and booster Andrija \" Puharich in the May/June Psychic magazine, Puha- rich's book about Geller was given an extremely bad review in the May 16 New York Review of Books, according to David Schroth of the UFO Study Group of Greater.St. Louis. Concerning the \"UFO Photograph\" in Psychic magazine, Schroth asks, \"Shall we see what Adrian Vance has to say about this?\" Geller's claim of close associations with UFO's has proved upsetting to many serious UFO researchers who feel ' there have already been too many fakes and too many hoaxes in a field which may be best approached on a scientific basis, rather than on the basis of selling books, or booking lucrative speaking engagements, or gaining appearances on TV. 20"}]
