Motzer Field Investigator for Arizona MUFON I n the May issue of the MUFON UFO Journal, there appeared a very mislead- ing article by Bill Hamilton on the Phoenix Lights of March 13, 1997. That ar- ticle represented a biased judgment of events and incorrect facts. Now, with these facts in mind, I am presenting the true infor- mation of the still ongoing investigation. At about 8:30 p.m. Thursday, the 13th of March, Peter Davenport at the UFO Reporting Center in Seattle, WA, started re- ceiving calls, first from the northwest part of Arizona, of a formation of lights moving south toward Prescott, AZ. These lights formed a basic triangle with as many as six or seven lights per side with two red lights trailing. The real time line for this event is some- where around 8:00 p.m. MST. As the calls kept flowing in, the description changed as to how many lights were involved. Some even said there w.ere no lights at all, but they could see a black mass blocking out the stars as it passed between the viewer and the sky. The general description was of a V, but it also resembled a crown with lights that formed ah upward triangle. These lights were not like aircraft landing lights but more like stars. This description would change as the objects moved into the Phoenix area. The only consistent properties of the object/objects would be that there were no sound and very slow movement. However, if there was only one object, it could not have covered that distance in such a short time. This is a real \"Catch-22,\" but may be the key to the solution. I know of three V formations that night and there may be more. As the readers may know, all of this was broadcast worldwide at 11:00 PST on Art Bell's Coast-to-Coast talk radio program. I knew it would be a very busy day for me the next morning, so I retired. I was involved with the videos of this event even before it happened. I received a call from Tom Taylor, our state director for MUFON, that a person in Paradise Valley had been taping lights west of the TV tow- ers on South Mountain for over two years, suggesting that I make contact with her to view the footage. I did so and set the next Wednesday, the 12th at 9:00 a.m., for her to come to my home to view the tapes. Due to the death of Mr. Taylor's mother, I changed the meeting date to the 14th, Friday, the day after the events of the 13th. While talking to her on the phone, I discussed the idea that she might be seeing flares from the Gila Bend Gunnery Range. She felt this was not the case, so we met Friday around 10:15 a.m. Even before her arrival, the news me- dia were at my house getting my reaction to the events of the night before. I had only seen one video, the formation shot by Chuck Rairden from Apache Junction. I told them that in a few minutes I would have a second video for all of us to see, because this lady had caught the event, too. The news programs broke the story with their 4:30 p.m. edition. From that time on, the phones never stopped ringing and the news people kept coming. I started to collect all the videos I could find and interviewed other witnesses. The first videos I obtained were of lights that ap- peared to be over the city of Phoenix and it was those videos that made the news pro- grams. It would be some days later before I could obtain the only video of five lights flying to the south taken at 56th Street and Carefree Highway. I have been involved in the collection of data, returning calls, and doing the interviews, which now number over seventy witnesses, of which I found 53 to be credible. The real investigating doesn't start until the last reports come in. One of the best investigation tools was a two-hour talk show I did with Bill Strauss on KTAR radio. Mr. Strauss is a very fair talk show host and allows the callers to tell their stories. It was during that show that I realized that the people who saw the V formations flying overhead out-numbered the people who saw the lights near the Estrella Mountains by a very high ratio. The V for- mation lights looked like stars with the brightness of Sirius, whereas the lights over the Estrella Mountains appeared as super bright landing lights. This was very puz- zling, because I had the video of the flying V formation where the lights are barely no- ticeable. So, why did 98% of the sightings The news programs broke the story with their 4:30 p.m. edition. From that time on, the phones never stopped ring- ing and the news people kept coming.

The best time to view Hale-Bopp was between 8:00 and 8:30 p.m. MST. 3. It was in motion flying toward them. 4. The altitude didn't matter as long as you were outside. You had to be at a higher elevation and have a clear view to the southwest to see the lights above and behind the Estrellas. W e will come back to the V formation again. Now we needed to find out why we had seven videos of the Estrella lights, but only a few witnesses. At this point, all of the TV stations were running the same video clips. People were being confused and thought the videos showed the V formation, which they didn't, but instead showed the lights to be over the city of Phoenix and that is what I mistak- enly thought, too. I don't know how many times I looked at those tapes and couldn't find the common thread. I received a call from a family far to the west of Phoenix where they, too, had taped the lights the night of the 13th and many other times. I made the long drive out to 222nd Avenue and Jackrabbit Blvd. to view the tape. The tape did not impress me but the people did. They said that the lights appear between 8:00 and 10:00 p.m.. were always in the same place and would drift laterally. They also said that a lot of heli- copter and fighter aircraft traffic was ob- served at times when these lights appeared. The highest activity was in the mid-part of the month and the most common days were Monday through Thursday. The other key item was that a large area of Bureau of Land Management land had been cordoned off in the direction of the lights. The woman's fu- ture son-in-law could see the land below the lights being illuminated like daylight. This was one of the keys, but I couldn't see how it would fit into the puzzle at that time. The next key was the person who taped both the Estrella lights and the V formation. He had some airline pilots, \"off the record,\" mark on the map the location and estimated elevation of the Estrella lights. Since I could not talk to them directly, I simply noted this on my map."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL /fun 1 ivWef) fry Mike Krzyston from lop of Ml. Ridge. The final key to the solution was also the biggest mystery. Why did all videos of 3- 13-97 at 10:00 p.m. have a different number of lights, different order of starting and de- cay, and shapes? It was really dependent upon the observa- tion point of the witness in the Phoenix area and, most important, how high their view- ing point was. It turned out that the lights were not over Phoenix, but near the Estrella Mountains to the southwest. This determi- nation was made after viewing all the video tapes and going to all but one of the sites and shooting 35mm film in daylight. Using the point marked by the pilot, I drew a line from each of the sites where the Estrella lights were taped. On the Rairden tape there are nine lights, but only eight lights on the Moon Valley footage. I re-ran the Moon Valley footage and just in the early part you see a light form briefly which then goes out, but did it really? No, something must have blocked it out, but it was still there in the Rairden footage. As the lights drifted down- ward, some lights were blocked out by the many small peaks making up the Estrella range. In the videos that I acquired, there were two people who had been recording these Estrella lights for months. What I wanted to find was footage where a tripod was used and the zoom lens was left in one spot. To my surprise there were several clips that met these specifications. What I did next was to mark at the end of each segment the ground position on a monitor and the ending position of each light. When I ran the editor video deck in reverse, I could see each light rise in altitude and drift to the right or to the left. In all the video clips the results were the same. Just before each light went out, there was an increase in the descent of each light. S o what did this prove? Going back to the first newscasts, they ended by say- ing the Army National Guard said that just before 10:00 p.m. on March 13, 1997, they shot off target flares for training. We had dismissed this at first because the witnesses felt certain these lights were in front of South Mountain and over the city. This caused the early confusion of the V forma- tion with these lights. The flares are very bright even at a distance of 50 miles and will overload a camcorder chip. They also have a parachute attached to them. As the flare is positioned and ignites, the heat from the flare heats the air above, which is trapped in its parachute, causing it to slow down its descent. Toward its final phase, be- fore extinguishing, the heat output de- creases and the flare will start to fall faster. It will also have a lateral motion due to its Toward its fi- nal phase, before extin- guishing, the heat output decreases and the flare will start to fall faster. It will also have a lateral mo- tion due to its delivery sys- tem, either hindered by the prevailing winds or ac- celerated.

Even the control tower people at Sky Harbor Airport said they saw smoke emanating from the flares. Let's quickly review the evidence for the case for flares behind the Estrellas. 1. These events have been going on for some time, three months or more. 2. The color is bright amber. 3. Smoke was seen by some. 4. The on to off time of each light is very consistent. 5. The general time lines and dates are repeated (for that night they occurred at 8:30, 9:25, and 10:00 p.m.) 6. Mostly week nights. 7. The Gila Bend Gunnery Range hours match the time line. 8. All drop vertically and move in a lat- eral direction consistent with flares. 9. All video tapes that have the complete cycle, that is, from start to finish, show this. 10. Two videos, shot at close range, seem to show smoke flowing around them. 11. On one of the tapes, the person asks if they are flares. 12. The Army National Guard said they shot-off these flares. 13. Six news programs announced that the military said they were flares and two reports were from military pilots who lo- cated them at the Gila Bend Gunnery Range behind the Estrella Mountains. D ue to the multitude of events that night and the confusion of these lights with the V formation, I didn't concentrate on this event. In fact, if these nine flares hadn't been fired off that night, the real big story— the one that needs to be solved—would not have made the TV news. The reason is that there is only one video, so far, that has been brought forward, and even though it was shot with a Sony Hi 8, the lights can barely be seen. I had to stretch the light scale in Adobe Premier for it to be used on the first Strange Universe show. Flares, then, appear to be the answer for the lights near the Estrella Mountains. Jour- nal readers may have seen these videos on the national TV news coverage. However, they cannot be the answer for the V forma- tion. What was this V formation seen by so many across the state of Arizona the evening of the 13th? If you use the 42 sec- ond video clip to make a judgment, you will see the last light on the western side move to the rear and maintain its alignment. If you drew lines through the points to make a five-point V, the sides appear to be slightly bowed to the outside. You hear no sound but only the person taking the video and his comments. The night was hazy at that loca- tion so no stars appear in this video clip. Luke AFB floated four stories about the V formation: 1. It was a flight of Blue Angels coming from Nellis AFB in Nevada. (Linda M. Howe said that a formation of five was also seen over Las Vegas heading southwest. The Blue Angels were not due for another day.) 2. It was a squadron of A 10s on a night- training mission heading back to Tucson. 3. None of ours! 4. A private plane with a skilled pilot fly- ing between restricted air corridors with a string of lights a mile long. I like that one myself — yeah, right! The question is why did Luke AFB change their stories? The Army National Guard didn't. Even though the V formation may or may not prove to be a real UFO after a thorough investigation, the other so-called \"sightings of the decade\" may well fade into history. As Paul Harvey says, \"Now you know the rest of the story.\" In the meantime, the real investigation is still going on ...

To do so, he suggests that we must deal with seven points that he brought up at the end of his article. He raises other ques- tions in his article which are easily chal- lenged, and he accuses us of selective re- porting of the data. Let's take a quick look at some of that, and then answer his seven points one at a time. Please remember that I do not have endless space in which to ad- dress his comments and therefore have se- lected some of them for response but not others. Kent writes, about the men of the 509th Bomb Group, \"Most of them heard nothing about the supposed crashed-saucer incident until years later, after all the publicity started. The few men who did recall hearing about the incident at the time of its occur- rence said that the inside word was that the debris was from a downed balloon of some kind and that there was no more than one wheelbarrow full.\" Overlooking the fact that highly classi- fied events would not be discussed among the officers because they were, by defini- tion, highly classified, let's look at a state- ment by Colonel (later brigadier general) Thomas DuBose. According to him, and recorded on video tape (August 10, 1990), \"He (Major General Clements McMullen, deputy commander of SAC) called me and said... Nobody, and I must stress this, no one was to discuss this with their wives, me with Ramey, with anyone. The matter, as far as we're concerned, it was closed.\" What we have here is evidence of orders, coming from the headquarters of the Strategic Air Command that the officers of the Eighth Air Force and the 509th Bomb Group were not to discuss this matter amongst themselves. Those who were not involved would not be told about it because of the high classification. And those former members of the 509th who believe that had something like this happened they would have heard about it must rethink their theory. Many military units have secrets that are shared only with those who have a need to know. To suggest a sharing of classified material with those who are not cleared to hear it reveals a mis- understanding of how this works. And, re- member, DuBose acknowledged that an or- der had been given. Kent also uses the testi- mony that was published by William L. Moore in The Roswell Incident and later by Moore and Jaime Shandera in their articles about the debris taken to Brigadier General Roger Ramey's office. I have suggested all along that the debris photographed was not the real stuff. Kent, however, writes, \"Among Marcel's responses were They took one picture of me on the floor holding up some of the less-interesting metallic de- bris... The stuff in that one photo was pieces of the actual stuff we had found. It was not a staged photo.'\" Kent does not report the rest of the quote which tends to refute his contention that the debris on the floor was never switched. Marcel supposedly also said, \"Later, they cleared out our wreckage and substituted some of their own. They then allowed more photos. Those photos were taken while the actual wreckage was on its way to Wright Field. I was not in those.\" If that wasn't enough, when we check the record, we find that Moore and Shandera have published three versions of the original quote, each altered to fit the circumstances as they were developing during various in- vestigations. Moore provided a transcript of the February 1979 interview with Marcel that now said, \"General (Roger Maxwell) Ramey allowed the press in to take two pic- tures of this stuff. I was in one, and he and Col. DuBose were in the other. [Emphasis added to show the difference in the quote.]\" In their article \"Three Hours That Shook the Press,\" Focus, New Series Vol. 5, nos. 7-9, September 30, 1990, Shandera and Moore write, \"In his interview with Moore (The Roswell Incident) Maj. Marcel main- tained that the debris in the two photos of him is the real stuff [Emphasis added].\" So we see that the quotes by Moore and Shandera referring to the number of pictures taken in General Ramey's office, who was in those pictures, and the situation around them, can't be trusted. In fact, Marcel him- So we see that the quotes by Moore and Shandera re- ferring to the number of pictures taken in General Ramey's of- fice, who was in those pic- tures, and the situation around them, can't be tru- sted.

You can't re- ject testimony simply because you don't like it. If you can offer a rea- sonable mo- tive for that rejection, then you can proceed with your case. July 1997 Number 351 Pages self has been quoted by a disinterested third party. Reporter Johnny Mann accompanied Marcel to Roswell in 1980 to interview him about the UFO crash. Mann found the pic- ture of Marcel posed by the weather balloon and told him, \"Jess, I gotta tell you. This looks like a weather balloon.\" According to Mann, Marcel said, \"That's not the stuff I found on the ranch.\" In other words, the only ones to report that Marcel was photographed with the \"real\" debris were Moore and Shandera. All evidence to the contrary was apparently overlooked by Kent as he attempted to prove that what was on the floor in Ramey's office was the mate- rial found out on the Foster ranch. Kent also wrote, \"Rancher Mac_Brazel is quoted as talking about sticks, foil, and tape with flower patterns.\" But Kent doesn't quote the last, and possibly most important part of the July 9, 1947 story. Speaking of the balloon explanation, the newspaper reported, \"Brazel said that he had previously found weather observation balloons on two other occasions... but that what he found this time did not in any way resemble either of these.\" But, if what was found was a Project Mogul balloon as alleged, or just any sort of balloon as Kent suggests, then it would have been exactly like those. That is what we are talking about when we talk of Mogul Flight #4. It was a cluster of regular weather balloons and contained nothing to fool Brazel, Marcel, or anyone else. B ut, with space running out, let's look at Kent's seven points that must be ad- dressed according to Kent himself. He wrote, \"A machine with unimaginable tech- nological sophistication and consequent in- credible reliability would have simply bro- ken down and crashed.\" Even if the \"perfect\" machine could be built, there are always the human factors (in this case alien factor, unless you want to be- lieve them infallible, too), and the environ- mental factors in this extremely weak argu- ment. In today's world, aircraft are designed to withstand strikes by lightning. However, according to a recent PrlmeTime Live on ABC, lightning was a contributing factor in the recent destruction of a commercial jet. Yes, the mean time to failure has im- proved. Yes, our computers, electronics, and machinery all operate much longer, but they do still break. And when they don't break on their own, there is always someone there to make a mistake causing them to break. In other words, this argument is without foun- dation. Kent next wrote, \"The only known wreckage from this sophisticated vehicle, capable of interstellar travel, would have consisted solely of a few short beams, pieces of foil-like material, and small pieces of thin plastic-like material.\" Yes, that is basically the debris as de- scribed by those who were on the Foster ranch. I would add the fiber optics de- scribed by Bill Brazel, Jr., but that doesn't alter Kent's point. There is not the range of debris you would expect from a crashing craft., Of course, that doesn't cover the craft and bodies found elsewhere. Kent was quick to tell me, angrily, that there was no craft and there were no bodies and therefore his point remains valid. He rejects, out of hand, all reference to the craft and bodies, weakening his argument considerably. You can't reject testimony simply because you don't like it. If you can offer a reasonable motive for that rejection, then you can pro- ceed with your case. If you reject it because it is inconvenient, then your point is not valid. Kent has ignored the statements by Major (later full colonel) Edwin Easley, Major (later full colonel) Patrick Saunders, Brigadier General Arthur Exon, Dr. W. Curry Holden, reporter Johnny McBoyle and many others. Each spoke of the second crash site in first-hand terms. Kent's next point is \"Despite the fact that this would have been the most spectacular"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL event in recorded history, and despite the fact that word was already out that some- thing had happened (because of Lt. Haul's press release), there was absolutely no con- temporary discussion or talk about such an earthshaking event among the pilots and navigators of the close-knit 509th Bomb Group.\" This is absolutely ridiculous when it is remembered that these were trained officers who were schooled in keeping their mouths shut and when it is remembered, according to General DuBose, orders had been issued. When the 509th was formed, with the pur- pose of dropping the atomic bombs, the men were brought to the base and told that they would be involved in a special assign- ment. They were told to tell no one of this. As a security check, they were allowed to glimpse \"special\" equipment, or \"special\" orders. They all were given a leave before having to report back for training. Herculean efforts were made to track each of these men, engage them in conver- sation, and to see just how much they would talk about their \"special\" assignments, or the \"special\" equipment they saw. Each who mentioned anything was dismissed from the unit and returned to his original assignment. The point is, these men knew that you didn't talk out of school to anyone who did not have \"A NEED TO KNOW.\" Kent then wrote, \"West Point graduate and retired general Thomas DuBose, would have had lied nine times in an interview when he stated that the debris (definitely that from an ML-307 radar reflector) shown in the pic- tures in Ramey's office was not substituted material and was \"real debris\" recovered from the ranch northwest of Roswell.\" This is one of the weakest arguments that Kent has made. First, he accepts, as com- pletely accurate, Shandera's interview with DuBose, but according to DuBose and his wife, Shandera took neither notes nor made a tape recording. In other words, we are treated to Shandera's version of the events with no corroboration. But, when DuBose was asked if he had seen the Roswell debris, he said, \"Never.\" After the publication of Shandera's inter- view, he was asked again if he had ever seen the real debris and in a letter, he wrote, \"NO!\" Billy Cox, a disinterested third party and a writer for Florida Today, interviewed DuBose for an article he wrote for the November 24, 1991 edition of that newspa- per. Cox reported that DuBose told him es- New Revelations About. The UFO Crash Coverup 50 Years Ago sentially the same story as outlined in UFO Crash at Roswell. In a letter dated September 30, 1991, Cox wrote. \"I was aware of the recent controversy generated by an interview he (DuBose) had with Jamie Shandera, during which he stated that the display debris at Fort Worth was gen- uine UFO wreckage and not a weather bal- loon, as he had previously stated. But I chose not to complicate matters by asking him to illuminate what he had told Shandera; instead, I simply asked him. without pressure, to recall events as he re- membered them... he seemed especially adamant about his role in the Roswell case. While he stated that he didn't think the de- bris was extraterrestrial in nature (though he had no facts to support his opinion), he was insistent that the material that Ramey dis- played for the press was in fact a weather balloon, and that he had personally trans- ferred the real stuff in a lead-lined mail pouch to a courier going to Washington... I can only conclude that the Shandera inter- view was the end result of the confusion that might occur when someone attempts to press a narrow point of view upon a 90 year old man. I had no ambiguity in my mind that Mr. DuBose was telling me the truth.\" 1 Jl Fhat we see here is that DuBose didn't V w lie nine times. We have a disagree- ment between what Shandera reported about what DuBose said, and the video tape and Jeffrey ac- cepts, as completely accurate, Shandera's interview with DuBose, but according to DuBose and his wife, Shandera took neither notes nor made a tape recording. In other words, we are treated to Shandera's version of the events with no corrobora- tion. July 1997 Number 351 Page 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL \"Why would these men create this story if it was not true?\" They did not seek the spotlight as so many oth- ers have. They did not expect a monetary re- ward for their information. In fact, they gained noth- ing by sug- gesting there was anything true to the story of the crashed saucer. July 1997 Number 351 Page 10 reporters' notes of what DuBose actually said. The problem is not DuBose but S Handera. Next Kent wrote, \"Major General C.P. Cabell, Director of Intelligence for the Air Force at the Pentagon, who prepared a re- port on the unidentified flying object situa- tion for the Secretary of Defense, astound- ingly, would have been preparing the report totally ignorant of the fact that the Air Force was in possession of a crashed flying saucer.\" Actually that is not exactly true. Can we find any instances in which military officers wrote to civilian representatives of the gov- ernment and lied? Yes. Senator Jeff Bingaman asked the Congressional Inquiry Division, Office of Legislative Liaison about Project Moon Dust. Lieutenant Colonel John E. Madison wrote, \"In addi- tion there is no Project Moon Dust or Operation Blue Fly. Those missions have never existed.\" This is not an accurate state- ment. More importantly, when Madison's state- ments were challenged, Colonel George M. Mattingley, Jr. wrote that Moon Dust had existed, but it was never used. Mattingley had to know that Moon Dust had been de- ployed. He gave Bingaman a history of Moon Dust. Therefore, Mattingley knowing lied to a United States Senator, as did Madison. This is not exactly the same situation as described by Kent but it does establish a precedence. Yes, military officers have knowingly lied to the civilian governmental representatives when they believed national security was at stake. Finally Kent wrote, \"Three retired Air Force colonels, all former top officials at the Foreign Technology Division at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base would have been lying to me — unnecessar- ily wasting inordinate amounts of their own personal time in a protracted game of cha- rades.\" Again, this argument is weak on the face of it. If we look at history we find many ex- amples of military officers serving in criti- cal positions but not in possession of com- plete information. During the Second World War we had broken a number of the Japanese codes and were reading inter- cepted messages under the code name Magic. Very few knew about it. I believe that MacArthur's staff in the Southwest Pacific contained two people who were \"Magic\" qualified, MacArthur and MacArthur's chief of intelligence. To sug- gest that Magic didn't exist because other, high-ranking members of MacArthur's staff had said they heard nothing about it is ridiculous. If you interview those men, would they be lying if they said Magic didn't exist, because, to them, it didn't? Finished with that, Kent asked, \"What basis is there now for postulating the existence of a crashed UFO?\" Simple. The testimony of Edwin Easley, himself a retired colonel who told me the craft was extraterrestrial. The testimony of Patrick Saunders, himself a retired colonel who wrote on the flyleaf to The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell that \"Here's the truth and I still haven't told anybody any- thing!\" which he then .signed. And the testi- mony of Arthur Exon, himself a retired brigadier general, who talked of two distinct sites, and who talked of the people at Wright-Patterson who had examined the de- bris and bodies of the alien creatures. My two colonels and one brigadier general trump Kent's three colonels. The question that can be asked here, in sort of a reverse on what Kent has written is \"Why would these men create this story if it was not true?\" They did not seek the spot- light as so many others have. They did not expect a monetary reward for their informa- tion. In fact, they gained nothing by sug- gesting there was anything true to the story of the crashed saucer. Would they spend their time lying to me? Exon and I even ate lunch in the Wright-Patterson officers' club. I had hoped, in reading Kent's article, I would find something that was persuasive. I had hoped that there would be a revelation that would suggest a good reason for Kent to so radically alter his position. That I didn't find. Kent has written that the case is closed. To his mind, he has solved it with interviews he conducted and his analysis of the situation. But such isn't the case because he dismissed too much of the testimony that doesn't fit with his view. As I said, you can't reject inconvenient testimony until you provide a proper framework for that re- jection. He has failed to do so and therefore his reasons for rejecting the Roswell UFO crash are less than persuasive."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL MY WEEK WITH THE WEEKLY WORLD NEWS by Greg Sandow O ne day, browsing through UFO-re- lated e-mail, I found this from Ed Komarek, of Operation Right to Know. It wasn't addressed specifically to me—it was part of a large UFO e-mail sub- scription list—but it did catch my eye, espe- cially the part that read: \"I would like to see a book written explor- ing the interactions and relationships be- tween such debunkers as Karl Pflock, Kal Korff, Col. Weaver, Phil Klass, James Oberg, Carl Sagan, Donald Menzel etc. I would also like to see investigations of CSI- COP and the tabloid press particularly the Weekly World News.\" Now, I don't claim to be an expert on this laundry list of UFO enemies, but I do know a thing or two about the Weekly World News. When I was critic-at-large for Entertainment Weekly, I wrote a feature on it, got to know the editors, and even worked in its office for a week. I'm sure most of us know the paper. It's the tabloid in garish black and white, with headlines like \"Alien Backs Clinton,\" \"Two- Headed Woman Has Two-Headed Baby,\" and \"Woman Eaten By Fur Coat.\" This last, I think, was their best ever. A woman checked into an inn somewhere in Romania, I believe, wearing an expensive mink. The next morn- ing her body was found, badly chewed, the coat was missing — and there were traces of mink saliva in the victim's wounds! The Weekly World News, for those who want to know the true story, is owned by the National Enquirer. Many years ago, the Enquirer was a truly trashy tabloid, printed in black and white and running stories about weird and paranormal events, alongside (I think — I wasn't reading it then) celebrity gossip. It also did some reasonably reputable UFO reporting, probably on the theory that its readers wouldn't know the difference, so why not give it a shot? But then came a push for fame, and, more than anything else, I'm sure, fortune, and the Enquirer went respectable. It purchased color presses, conceived a plan to elevate itself by concentrating on celebrities, and conceived the Weekly World News mainly as a way to keep making money from the old black and white presses, which were still around, and might as well be put to use. The result, from the Enquirer's point of view, is the eminence it enjoys today. We, as we ponder the mys- tery of alien tunnels under Dulce, New Mexico, may scoff. But the Equirer is not only rich, but respected in journalistic circles for the unfailing accuracy of its celebrity dirt, something the mainstream press finally ad- mitted after the O.J. Simpson trial, during the many months of which the New York Times and the Washington Post found themselves on the same beat as the Enquirer, and had to publicly admit that the Enquirer did it better. (The Enquirer did miss the boat with the de- licious Frank and Kathie Lee Gifford scan- dal, but nobody's perfect.) Meanwhile, sitting off in a corner of the Enquirer's building in Lantana, FL (a low- rent neighbor of Palm Beach), are the 20-odd folks who put out the Weekly World News, good souls who've learned to grin and bear it when Enquirer staffers pass by, holding their noses to ward off the disreputable stench. After all, as one Enquirer stalwart said to me, with disdain in her voice, \"They don't check their stories!\" Don't check them? Hell, as you'd think the whole world knew by now, they make them up, except for a few that they actually do go out and report, or rehash from wire services. These are mostly about gore or sen- timent—human bones found in a bus station locker, let's say, or a Texas cowboy buried, as he'd wished, with his boots on. You can always tell which stories these are. Just com- pare the bylines with the Weekly World News masthead. If the writer is listed, the story is true, or at least as true as anything you'd read in a mainstream newspaper. If the writer can't be found, then the story is fiction—or \"freelance,\" as the expression goes at the WWN, the conceit being that the really juicy items are submitted by freelance correspon- dents, and the reality, of course, being that \"freelance\" is office shorthand for \"fic- tional.\" So who runs this operation? The higher- level staff-writers and editors (as of three years or so ago) fell into two main cate- gories: Good ol' boys from southern newspa- pers, some continuing at the WWN after re- tirement, and educated northern types who The Weekly World News, for those who want to know the true story, is owned by the National Enquirer, mainly as a way to keep making money from their old black and white presses.

ALIEN HEAD! As I quickly learned, one semi-official rule at the WWN was that really wacko scien- tific stuff had to be credited to researchers abroad, in a country where English isn't the native language, so readers couldn't eas- ily check on it. July 1997 Number 351 Page 12 somehow fell off the journalistic career lad- der, and ended up in Lantana. The top two editors reflected these two types very neatly. Eddie Klontz, the editor in chief (and does he ever want you to feel his authority!) speaks in the buttery tones of North Carolina, except when he barks orders across the office. When I first met him, he refused to use a computer, sporting proudly instead a Remington type- writer that looked like it had been through World War II in combat! You used to be able to find Eddie's self-caricature in the raving rightwing \"Ed Anger\" column, which he wrote, pretending to be the ultimate pro- America redneck. Sal Ivone, who used to be the managing editor, is from Brooklyn, NY, and — when I first visited his apartment in South Palm Beach — had a copy of Foreign Affairs mag- azine on his coffee table, right next to the lat- est issue of the WWN (a pairing I'd think isn't very commonly duplicated, except pos- sibly in my own place). Sal had a serious streak to match Eddie's manic wildness, and got very concerned, when I first met him, when I told him I was interested in UFOs. I could see from the dubious look in his eye what he was thinking —\"This nutjob be- lieves our stories, and that's why he came down from New York to write about us!\" I laughed, and assured him this wasn't the case, and from then on we got along just fine. (Especially when the bartender at the Ritz Carlton in Palm Beach, where we happened to be, started telling us about his own fairly serious UFO sighting, which fascinated Sal as much as it fascinated me.) But I digress. Life at the WWN was often entertaining, at least when Eddie wasn't on a tear. I couldn't help but giggle when I saw Sal and a couple of other grown or semi- grown men bending over a computer-con- cocted picture of a dinosaur on a Nevada highway, trying to decide whether the beast should be moved a little further to the right. When I worked there — an adventure cooked up by Sal and Eddie, who suggested I take a vacation working for them, and not only paid me, but gave me a room at their fa- vorite hangout, a motel right on the beach, and a (tiny) rental car, as part of the deal — I'd find Eddie ordering all the writers to come up with \"five freelance shorts\" by the end of the afternoon. A \"freelance short\" was WWN jargon for a made-up story one to four- sentences long, the more outrageous the bet- ter. One day Susan Jimison, tall and weath- ered (though she swore revenge when I used this word about her in print, and I had to send her flowers), got on a roll, and kept announc- ing things like: \"I think I'm going to say that yodeling is an aphrodisiac. I'll cite research by Swiss scientists!\" (Susan's now the Managing Editor. One small step for a woman?) The Swiss scientists, though, were more than local color in a story like that. As I quickly learned, one semi-official rule at the WWN was that really wacko scientific stuff had to be credited to researchers abroad, in a country where English isn't the native lan- guage, so readers couldn't easily check on it. That's why the woman who got eaten by her coat met her demise in Romania. And when I came up with an item about a little girl who could read two books at once, one with each eye, I put her in a tiny Bulgarian village. (I even consulted an atlas to find a real one.) That allowed me to introduce a scientist from the university in Bulgaria's captitol, who could speculate that the eager little scholar might—could it be?—have two brains! Nor was the disdainful staffer from the Enquirer quite right when she said the WWN doesn't check its information. As I learned, the News practices a kind of anti-fact check- ing. Often, writers are given headlines, and asked to invent the story. One day I was handed something about tourists who visited Alcatraz seeing the ghost of the famous \"Birdman\" who was locked up there. I gave these frightened visitors names and a home town; they became Walter and Debbie Zazeela, of Macon, Georgia. But before the editors signed off on my work, I had to call"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL RUSSIAN government wants to cut funding and costly life-support for alien head. directory assistance in Macon, to determine that no such people were actually listed! I also learned that even the WWN has lim- its. In my Alcatraz story, I had Walter and Debbie say that they recognized the ghost, because it looked just like Burl Lancaster in the Birdman of Alcatraz movie. That got blue-penciled, because it was too much even for the Weekly World News. So was my com- ment, in a story headlined \"Hubble Space Telescope Discovers Twin Earth,\" that this other planet resembled ours in absolutely every detail, except that Rush Limbaugh was president. High spirits are allowed, but you're not allowed to stray over the edge into outright parody. You're supposed to write the way you would at a genuine newspaper, if the stories really were true. The readers. I found, mirrored the staff. Many come from the less educated, more rural parts of the country, and write letters to the News in pencil, on lined paper. Others are hip college kids, who read the paper for laughs, and wrote in just as enthusiastically when the WWN asked readers to help locate an escaped creature who. supposedly, was half-bat, half-human. The difference was that the college kids typed their letters, and didn't believe what they wrote. (This \"Batboy,\" one of the college types said, loved to eat pome- granates. Maybe the Birdman ate them, too.) What amazed me most, though, were the sackfuls of mail that arrived each week for the imaginary psychic who used to appear in the News, \"Serena Sabak.\" Her column was concocted by Eddie Clontz's brother Derek, at that time the paper's third in command. Derek boldly told readers exactly how to solve their problems — \"Your lost bracelet is in the third drawer on the right of your bu- reau, under the socks.\" And still the readers wrote in avidly, never once complaining, he swore to me, that his advice had proved false. B ut now for the meat of my invesitgation. What's the relation between the WWN and the government? It would be a mistake, I must firmly insist, to say that it doesn't have any government relationships. Quite the contrary! During the 1992 presidential campaign, the WWN ran a series of stories about a political space alien. First it met with George Bush, then with Perot, and finally with Bill Clinton, who— with an unerring instinct about which way the American people were leaning—it de- cided to support. If I remember correctly, each of the three candidates actually com- mented on these stories. After the election, the News declared that five senators were aliens, named them and got real, on the record reactions from each of their offices! (\"Only five? The real total is MUCH higher!\") Not only that, but Sal used to tell me, shaking his head in dismay, that the FBI used to call from time to time, objecting when the WWN took its name in vain. (\"How can you say we were involved in an investigation of a werewolf in Alabama? We demand that you stop!\") \"Don't they have anything better to do?\" Sal would ask, truly amazed. But is the WWN underwritten by counter- intelligence slush funds? Here we get onto highly speculative terrain, to say the least, but I will rush out on a fragile limb and take a wild guess-that the paper doesn't receive any such support. When I wrote my feature on the enterprise, and had to look into such tedious details as circulation and profitability, I got every sense — especially when I talked to a high executive of the Enquirer — that the WWN was purely a business proposition, expected to pull its own weight, and not al- ways doing so, at least not to the Enquirer's specifications. Like every mainstream publi- cation I've ever known about, the WWN's newsstand sales are meticulously tabulated, and attempts are made to figure out which Continued on Page 20 During the 1992 presi- dential cam- paign, the WWN ran a series of sto- ries about a political space alien.

Andrus, Jr. In the Delphos, Kansas UFO landing trace case, the analysis of the soil was the most sig- nificant fac- tor as it re- lated to the possible power source of the UFO. July 1997 Number 351 Page 14 O ne of the most highly investigated and analyzed UFO landing trace cases occurred in Delphos, Kansas, on the Durel Johnson farm on November 2, 1971. Ted Phillips was the prime investiga- tor starting on December 3, 1971, however, Frank E. Shrimplin, Valley Falls, KS, a MUFON state section director, produced color photographs of the scene on the morning of November 3, 1971. Walt Andrus continued the investigation until 1987, revealing among other rare events, the growth of mushrooms on the outside edge of the eight foot diameter ring that was about one foot in width. The author was given samples of the small brown mushrooms and photographs depicting their growth and configuration. When Durel Johnson was asked if mushrooms had ever been observed any- where on his property, he replied in the negative. William Hurtig, a Methodist min- ister, accompanied Frank Shrimplin to the site on November 3, 1971. He advised Walt that his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Alfred Hurtig, had lived on this same farm (where Rev. Hurtig had grown up) from 1942 until July 1958, and they had no memory of see- ing mushrooms on the farm. In the Delphos, Kansas UFO landing trace case, the analysis of the soil was the most significant factor as it related to the possible power source of the UFO. Ronnie Johnson and his dog, Snowball, witnessed a UFO hovering close to the ground only ten feet away when he stepped out of the sheep shed. Since there are spores that breed mushrooms in most soil that is not cultivated for long periods of time, it re- quires a triggering action of the proper amount of moisture and temperature to cause them to grow and literally pop through the soil. Apparently, just the right amount of moisture was present in the sheep lot, coupled with the heat and possi- ble microwave radiation from the UFO. This caused the mushrooms to sprout through the soil just outside of the baked and dehydrated soil in the eight-foot ring. On May 5, 1997,1 received a telephone call from Mr. Hugh Fairly of Martindale, Texas, advising me that a 46 foot diameter ring, two feet wide with large white mush- rooms growing in the ring, was found on a friend's farm/ranch northwest of San Marcos, Texas, on May 4th. He had made photographs of the scene when the owner and close friend had called him. They seemed to have all the characteristics of a \"fairy ring.\" Knowing what I had learned at Delphos, Kansas, however, the prospect of a UFO landing had possibilities. On the afternoon of May 6th, I met with Mr. and Mrs. Fairly and Mr. and Mrs. Williams to view and investigate the unique ring in the Williams' pasture (a meadow one mile long surrounded by hills and trees). The grass, a mixture of bermuda, \"KR\" (King Ranch) and others, had turned to a brown/purple color in the ring. There were 18 white-colored mushrooms varying in size from nine inches in diameter down to two inches (five were in the 6 1/2 to 7-inch diameter range). To determine if radiation existed in the ring, a Radiological Survey Meter OCDM Item No. CD V700, Model 5, manufactured by Anton Electronic Laboratories, Inc., Brooklyn, NY, was used by the author. There was no indication, whatsoever, of radiation at the site. After taking appropriate measurements, photographing the site, and bagging a sam- ple mushroom, soil samples were taken of the soil in the ring and both outside and in- side of the ring. In the ring sample, about one inch below the grass roots, the soil had an organic substance that was a bright blue or blue/grey in color. Samples taken out- side and inside of the ring were a normal black moist soil. White or beige-colored fungus strings were imbedded in the blue soil. Soil samples were taken in three dif- ferent areas of the ring in an equilateral tri- angle pattern. All showed the same blue fungus substance. On May 12, 1997, thir- teen fresh mushrooms appeared in the ring. The original large mushrooms dried up and formed \"brown puff balls\" or powder. There is no evidence that a UFO could have hovered over the cattle pasture. The Williams' home sits three-eighths of a mile away on a hill within a grove of trees, pre- venting them from observing this pasture either day or night."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL One of the questions on the MUFON Field Investigator's Examination is: \"Often mistaken as a UFO landing trace, the dis- tinctive feature of a fairy ring is a roughly circular configuration of fungi growth.\" So, what is a fairy ring and how is it cre- ated? I n order to learn more about fairy rings, I started by calling the Guadalupe County Extension Agent in Seguin, TX, where they accept soil samples from farmers to determine what elements and minerals are needed to improve the soil's growing prop- erties. I then contacted Cassandra McDonough, a MUFON Research Specialist, at Texas A&M University for assistance and recommendations since she had previously been active in crop circle research. After speaking to several profes- sors and heads of laboratories at Texas A&M, I was referred to Larry Barnes, Professor and Extension Plant Pathologist, who heads up the Disease Diagnostic Laboratory. Every person contacted was not only very friendly, but very coopera- tive when we discussed fairy rings. Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary defines a fairy ring as a \"ring of mushrooms produced at the periphery of a body of mycelium which has grown cen- trifugally from an initial growth point.\" The key word here is mycelium, which is defined as: \"the mass of interwoven fila- mentous hyphae that forms especially the vegetative portion of the thallus of a fun- gus and is often submerged in another body (as of soil or organic matter or the tissue of a host).\" Fungus, per the diction- ary, is \"Any of the major group (fungi) of saprophytic and parasite lower plants that lack of chlorophyll and include molds, rusts, mildews, smuts, mushrooms, and yeasts.\" Mr. Barnes pointed out that the original spore started in the middle of the circle and gradually moved outward in all directions forming a ring of decomposing organic matter as a natural environmental event to cleanse the soil. The triggering of mush- room sprouting is a very complicated process, but hinges upon the correct mois- ture and heat occurring at the same time. Texas has had more than average rainfall this spring and the temperatures have reached 90 degrees. The farm/ranch owner told me that he had never seen fairy rings in the 51 years that he has lived there. The conditions now must be very conducive for fairy ring pro- duction, since a new ring was found on May 19th that is elliptical in shape, mea- suring 31 by 36 feet. Thirteen large mush- rooms, up to 12 inches in diameter, and five small ones, have appeared in the same pasture as the original, about 800-900 feet to the northwest. The same blue soil is pre- dominate in the ring area, which further confirms that these are fairy rings and not UFO landing sites. This article is being published to supple- ment the information in the fourth edition of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual as a means of identifying fairy rings. Of course, the species of mushroom that appears will be native to your own lo- cality. The large white variety is native to south central Texas and is called amanita (death angel), being highly toxic. Samples of mushrooms with Mrs. Williams on left and Mrs. Fairly on right.

In 1949, Scully was approached by two veteran con- fidence men, Silas Newton and Leo GeBauer, posing respectively as a Texas oil man and a U.S. government scientist and authority on magnetics. Inspired by news- paper accounts of a publicity hoax perpe- trated by the producer of the 1949 science- fiction film The Flying Saucer, Newton and GeBauer—\"Dr. Gee\" in Scully's book— told the credulous Variety columnist a saucer had crashed near Aztec, New Mexico, in March 1948, killing the 16 \"little men\" aboard. Soon after, they claimed, two more saucers crashed in Arizona, also killing their hapless crews. Newton and GeBauer said the craft and bodies were recovered and spirited away by the U.S. Air Force, which was working to uncover and exploit the secrets of the alien technology. GeBauer, who claimed to have participated in the recovery operations, told Scully the saucers had no engines or fuel such as we know them, and \"probably flew on magnetic lines of force.\" Their crews subsisted on heavy water and \"little wafers,\" though the smallest of the three ships had no food or water stores and lacked the sleeping and toilet facilities of the larger two. When the Air Force carted the saucers away, GeBauer retained some parts of the craft for research, \"a tubeless radio, some gears, some small disks, and other items that could be carried in one's pocket.\" Scully was shown these materials, and wrote, \"More than 150 tests had failed to break down the metal of the gears,\" which were \"of a ratio unfamiliar to engineers on this earth\" and \"had no play, no lubrica- tion.\" One of the early fruits of GeBauer's work on these extraterrestrial goodies was a \"doo- dlebug,\" an oil-detection gadget, the heart of which was an alien magnetic device. When Newton and GeBauer's tale was told in Scully's bestseller, touting them as hav- ing access to literally out of this world tech- nology and the highest of official secrets, their credibility soared with potential in- vestors in their phony oil-finder. Donald Keyhoe, investigating flying saucers for True magazine and his book The Flying Saucers Are Real, looked into the yarn, quickly concluding it was a hoax. Two years later, J. P. Cahn conducted an in- depth investigation, unmasking Dr. Gee as GeBauer, revealing the doodlebug scheme, and exposing Newton's and GeBauer's long criminal histories (True, September 1952). Yet today there are those who still take the story seriously—not to mention various transmutations of it. The Day After Roswell is Behind the Flying Saucers audaciously tricked out in X-Files finery. In this case, however, the flimflam artist has eliminated the middle man and, with a little help, written the book himself. And there's no doodlebug being peddled, just books, a reported 80,000-copy first printing. Before considering Corso's claims, it is important to note that, despite his pub- lisher's unsubstantiated hype about \"docu- ments newly declassified through the Freedom of Information Act,\" other than re- ferring to some of the real and bogus docu- ments long known to UFO researchers, he provides absolutely nothing to back up his claims about crashed saucers and alien tech- nologies .

How could a guy like me be lying?\" A review of Corso's records confirms he retired from the U.S. Army in 1963 as a lieutenant colonel after 21 years' service, principally as an intelligence and artillery (anti-aircraft missiles) officer. He seems to have served about four years on the National Security Council staff during the Eisenhower administration and was on General Mac Arthur's staff in Japan during the Korean War. He has testified before Congress concerning Korean and Vietnam war POWs and other Americans believed still to be held in Russia, Korea, China, and Vietnam. From 1961 until his retirement, he served in and was at least for a few months chief of the Foreign Technology Division of army research and development in the Pentagon, reporting directly to the legendary Lt. Gen. Arthur Trudeau, chief of R&D and former head of army intelligence. It is Corso's alleged adventures during this latter assignment which are the focus of the book. C orso plays upon '90s paranoia about government cover-ups. A la Newton and GeBauer, he is inspired by and exploits not only all of the various versions of the Roswell non-crash-retrieval (a laughably garbled conglomeration of which begins the book), but also virtually every UFO-related theme and notion, old and new: cattle muti- lations, the Robertson Panel, harvesting of humans and human genetic material, Nikola Tesla, abductions. Star Wars as an anti-UFO defense, alien invasion by infiltration, Project Blue Book as a public-relations front and \"Moon Dust\" and \"Blue Fly\" as the real UFO projects, Paul Biefeld and Townsend Brown, the Santilli alien autopsy film, aliens as genetically engineered artifi- cial life-forms (our old friends the EBEs, extraterrestrial biological entities), Robert Sarbacher and Wilbert Smith, MJ-12, etc., even alien collaboration with the Nazis— presenting a veritable unified field theory of practically everything \"ufological.\" While on army R&D's foreign technol- ogy desk, Corso claims, he was responsible for the army's \"Roswell Files\" and seeding into American industry the alien technolo- gies they contained. However, it was many years earlier—to be exact, on the night July 6, 1947—that Corso says he got his first inkling of Roswell. As he made his rounds as the post duty officer at Fort Riley, Kansas, an enlisted bowling buddy \"pis- sted\" him into the fort's old veterinary building to look at the cargo of a truck con- voy headed from Roswell to Wright Field, Ohio. Corso forced open a crate and saw an alien being floating in a large glass con- tainer. Somehow he knew it was from outer space. His mind reeling, he tells us, the young Corso continued his rounds, desper- ately forcing from his mind this chance pre- saging of his FTD assignment decades later. In 1961, as Corso was taking up his FTD duties of analyzing and evaluating foreign military technologies, Gen. Trudeau handed him a far more important job. He was en- trusted with a locked file cabinet containing not only reports on the crashed engine-less, fuel-less, food-bed-toilet-less, magnetic- field-riding Roswell saucer and medical evaluations of the ship's dead genetically engineered crew, but also actual fragments of fabulous technologies from another world. It seems these wonders had not been exploited for various bureaucratic and secu- rity reasons, and Gen. Trudeau was deter- mined to push things forward. Corso's job was to insinuate these technologies into government and industrial R&D through ex- isting defense contracts and programs, al- lowing them to be absorbed and developed while knowledge of their true origins dis- solved like the morning dew. Corso tells us he set about his mission ea- gerly. He worked long into many Pentagon nights writing reports for Trudeau, setting out his evaluations of the alien technologies and his brilliant insights into their workings and potential applications, something for While on army R&D's foreign tech- nology desk, Corso claims, he was re- sponsible for the army's \"Roswell Files\" and seeding into American in- dustry the alien tech- nologies they contained.

If Corso's egoistic fever dreams are taken as fact, he is responsible for nothing short of making possible the cornerstones of the technological revolution of the second half of the twentieth century—the integrated- circuit chip, lasers (a hand-held cow-slicer was found at Roswell), fiber optics—plus many other militarily and scientifically im- portant capabilities—night-vision systems (a \"two-piece set of dark elliptical eyepieces as thin as skin\" was in Corso's file cabinet; see the Santilli film), Kevlar armor, stealth, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI, or Star Wars), high-speed, nap-of-the-earth night flying. And on and on and on. His work made it possible for the West to win the Cold War while keeping our kids enter- tained with video games. But wait, that's not all. Corso also per- sonally and privately briefed Attorney General Robert Kennedy on the strategic significance of space. He did not tell Kennedy about the alien threat, but he knew the president's brother understood there was more to the story than merely thwarting Soviet designs. Corso is certain this led to President John F. Kennedy's commitment to put a man on the moon before the sixties were out. Oh, yes, and Corso's musings on the need for. mankind to train and adapt for spaceflight, inspired by his knowledge of the Roswell aliens, led to the establishment of NASA's Space Camp for kids. B ut wait, there's more! Not only did the technological revolution, notably SDI, spawned by Corso's secret labors win the Cold War, it won the far more sinister war with the aliens, turning their own technolo- gies against them. For some reason the shadowy aliens, who lurk menacingly around the fringes of Corso's narrative to be invoked when he needs them to pump up the drama, did not press their advantage for 14 years. Then, with Corso on the job, it was too late. But wait, there's even more! You see, the naughty CIA was actually in cahoots with the Soviet KGB and worked diligently to thwart Corso's efforts and learn the secrets of Roswell. But Corso stood up to them: \"The CIA had a tail on me all throughout my four-year tenure at the White House.... Then, when I came back to Washington in 1961 to work for General Trudeau, they put the tail back on and I led him down every back alley and rough neighborhood in D.C. that I could. He wouldn't shake. So the next day,...I led my faceless pursuer right to Langley, Virginia [CIA headquarters], past a sputtering secretary, and straight into the of- fice of my old adversary, the director of covert operations Frank Wiesner, one of the best friends the KGB ever had. I told Wiesner to his face that yesterday was the last day I would walk around Washington without a handgun. And I put my .45 auto- matic on his desk. I said if I saw his tail to- morrow, they'd find him in the Potomac the next day, with two bloody holes for eyes; that is, if they bothered to look for him.\" What a guy! Of course, what else could we expect from someone who tells us he numbered J. Edgar Hoover among his best friends and, in a career-ending move, tipped off U.S. Senator Kenneth Keating (\"one of my friends\") to Soviet intermediate-range ballistic missiles in Cuba (this may be one of the few true exploits in this unintention- ally very funny book). The litany of Corso's earth-and mankind- saving works goes on and on, but more telling are the many things he gets wrong. A few examples: • He claims he and Gen. Trudeau played a major role in developing and launching Corona, the world's first spy-satellite pro- gram, because they wanted a means to de- tect UFO landings in the Soviet Union. He says they \"slipped the Corona photo-sur- veillance payload directly into the ongoing Discoverer program, reverse-engineering Discoverer to make the payload fit,\" and identifies Discoverer as a NASA project. He also tells us of the \"jubilation at the Pentagon\" when the photos from the first Corona mission were developed. Corona was a 100% CIA-Air Force pro- ject; NASA and the army had nothing to do with it, not even to provide cover. It began in 1958, three years before Corso was as- signed to the Pentagon. It was a \"black\" program hidden inside the Air Force's Discoverer space-medicine research project, expressly created as a cover for Corona. The first mission, launched on February 28,"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL 1959, more than two years before Corso went to work for Trudeau, failed and didn't even have a camera aboard. The first pho- tography was provided by the fourteenth mission, Discoverer 14, code named \"Limber Leg\" and launched on August 18, 1960, almost a year before Corso joined army R&D. • He claims such advanced, Corso- seeded Star Wars technologies as missile- launched high-energy lasers and directed- particle-beam weapons have been deployed, thwarting the evil aliens' designs on earth, which Corso tells us was the secret purpose of SDI. No such deployments have taken place. • A retired army officer, Corso at least twice misidentifies the Wac-Corporal, an old army research rocket, as a navy system, saying it was the rocket that blew up on the pad in an attempt to put the first U.S. space satellite in orbit in December 1957. Actually, this was Vanguard, a navy-devel- oped system. • He says the B-2 stealth bomber was spawned by Lockheed. It is a Northrop cre- ation. This is a notably odd slip-up, as else- where in the book Corso hints broadly that an earlier U.S. flying-wing bomber, the Northrop YB-49, was a product of Air Force exploitation of Roswell technology: 'The YB-49's quadruple vertical tail [sic] fins were so uncannily reminiscent of the head-on Roswell craft sketches in our files that it was hard not to make a connection between the spacecraft and the bomber.\" (By the way, for those who were wondering, Corso reveals the Air Force ultimately stashed and studied the Roswell saucer and some of the bodies at Norton Air Force Base, California. Another saucer, which Corso claims was forced down by an army missile in Germany in 1974, went to Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, where no doubt it is secreted at Area 51.) • He claims the F-117 stealth fighter is \"almost crescent shaped...uncannily like the space vehicle that crashed into the arroyo outside of Roswell\" (hint, hint). The F-117 is arrowhead shaped and employs rather mundane and obsolescent technologies to work its stealthy wonders. • He says Willy Ley, the late science writer and spaceflight enthusiast, was a German rocket scientist and part of Wernher von Braun's team at AlamogordoAVhite Sands in 1947. He was neither. • Corso claims the \"Backfire,\" a super- sonic Soviet swing-wing jet bomber was operational in the 1950s, and his Nike mis- sile battalion in Germany (1957-58) and others like it were there to defend against this threat. The Backfire, the Soviet equiva- lent of our B-l, was not deployed until the 1980s. One would think a military technology and intelligence whiz like Corso, who re- members precisely and at length the text of memos and the details and nuances of con- versations 35 and more years after the fact, could get such simple things straight. But these lapses pale beside his greatest failing, one of honor. I was flabbergasted when I discovered Senator Strom Thurmond, president pro tempore of the U.S. Senate, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, longest serving U.S. senator, retired army reserve major general, D-Day paratrooper, American political legend and icon had written a brief foreword to Corso's book, praising Corso as a patriot and commend- ing him for his service to his country, but including not a word about the book s con- tent. My surprise grew when I read Corso's account of an alleged 1960s-vintage conver- sation in which, according to Corso's telling, Senator Thurmond winkingly sig- nals his knowledge of the intrepid colonel's work with alien technology. I called the senator's press secretary and learned Corso, who had put in two short stints on Thurmond's staff in the 1960s and 1970s, had asked the senator to write a fore- word to his memoirs, / Walked with Giants: My Career in Military Intelligence, not a book about his Roswell-related exploits and U.S. government cover-up of a UFO crash. Quoting Senator Thurmond from his June 5 press release on the matter: \"The outline of 'I Walk[ed] with Giants' provided to me by Mr. Corso indicated he was writing a book of his recollections and observations on top- ics such as World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnamese Conflict, intelligence, espi- onage, and counter-espionage operations. There was absolutely no mention, sugges- tion, or indication that any of the chapters and subjects listed dealt with Unidentified Flying Objects and government conspira- cies to cover-up the existence of such a space vehicle.\" (Emphasis in original.) As Corso says Willy Ley, the late science writer and spaceflight enthusiast, was a German rocket scien- tist and part of Wernher von Braun's team at Alamogordo/ White Sands in 1947. He was neither.

A writer and UFO researcher, he is the author of Roswell in Perspective (Fund for UFO Research. 1994). In January 1994 he spent several hours with Lt. Col.

Hence all the re- peats—the alien with each of the candidates, and then, after the election, taking Clinton for a spin in space — though everyone would grumble that the followups never sold as well as the original did. From all of this I emerged with the definite notion of an operation con- ducted with an eye—sometimes a worried eye — firmly on the bottom line. If CIA money is being funneled in, it's happening at a level higher than the Enquirer's chief finan- cial guy. Besides, you'd think an intellgence opera- tion would do a better job. I went through the photo files one day, and found the outtakes from the alien/president photo shoots. What a pathetic alien — you could see, in half the shots, flagrant cracks in the papier mache. Similarly, I doubt that intelligence agencies influence the paper's content. They'd hardly have to: as I've said, on a good day, the staff has an uproarious time thinking these things up. Besides, if the stories in the News are subtly shaded by government agencies, someone forgot to tell the FBI. Such luxury? To take an hour out of a busy day to tell stories about the Weekly World News. And there's more...the piles and piles of mail from people who thought they'd seen Elvis, heartlessly destroyed when they should have been donated to a folklore archive...the soldier who wrote to the two- headed woman with the two-headed baby, quite seriously proposing marriage...someone could write a book about this stuff. But until that book appears, I hope that I've shed some light on a matter of at least minor importance to ufology.

August 1997 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Venus (magnitude -4.0) is low in the W at dusk, setting about 9 PM in mid-August. It is near the lunar crescent on the 5th and 6th. The southern states get a higher and better view of the brilliant planet. Mars (1.0). in Virgo, is also low in the WSW at twilight, now setting soon after 10 PM in midmonth. The red planet stands 2° above the star Spica on August 2. Jupiter (-2.8), in Capricornus, reaches a point opposite the Sun on the 9th, therefore remaining visible all night. The conspicuous giant rises in the ESE near sunset and moves eastward to due S at midnight. Saturn (0.4), in Pisces, rises in the E about 10 PM in mid- August and then continues across the SE sky. The world with rings begins retrograde motion on the 2nd. It can be found near the gibbous Moon on August 21. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Jupiter advances across the SW heavens, finally setting in the WSW near sunrise. Saturn moves to a point high in the S at dawn. Meteor Shower After the quarter Moon sets about midnight on the night of August 11-12, the Perseid meteors achieve maximum num- bers of between 50 and 100 per hour toward dawn. This re- liable annual display produces very fast and bright meteors, a third of them leaving behind smoky wakes which may persist several seconds before fading. The shower continues in lesser numbers from late July to late August. Moon Phases: New moon—August 3 First quarter—August 11 Full moon—August 18 Last quarter—August 24 C o 3 The Stars: This month it is well worth the effort to find a dark open site away from city light pollution in order to glimpse the subtle beauty of the Milky Way. This vast river of starlight—the edge-on view we have of our wheel-shaped home galaxy—arches across the sky from N to S. Along its path at 10 PM lie (from N to S) the constellations Perseus, Cassiopeia, Cygnus, Aquila, Sagittarius, and Scorpius. The center or hub of this gigantic wheel of stars is in the direc- tion of Sagittarius, where the Milky Way brightens and broadens considerably.
