All Rights Reserved. As 2007 comes to a close, I am excited about the prospects of 2008. In this special issue of the MUFON Journal you will find a roadmap of where MUFON is headed and a list of new initiatives that will keep the hard working volunteers at MUFON very busy in the new year. 2007 was a banner year for Ufology, from worldwide coverage of the O’Hare incident to the international press conference that is this month’s cover story. UFOs are back in the news and the public consciousness. This is good news for MUFON, but it also means that we need your help more than ever to assist MUFON in meeting its mission and goals. I ask that you take the time to read about the important changes that are coming and not only embrace them but to actively parti- cipate in whatever capacity you can. From investigations to research to educating the public, you can make a difference by putting MUFON’s mission in practice. Thank you for being part of the MUFON family. From all of us at MUFON headquarters, I wish you and your loved ones a happy holiday and a joyous new year!"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"      3 MUFON UFO Journal December 2007 Continued on page 22 Military and government officials, scientists and research- ers from nine countries gathered at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. on November 12 to recount their personal UFO testimonies and to call for establishment of an investiga- tive UFO agency in the United States. The stated goals of the event were: ! Presenting official data on unidentified aerial phenomena. ! Promoting international cooperation among governments and the military in investigating UFOs. The group created an International Declaration to the United State Government (see pages 4 and 5), calling for an international dialogue with other governments which have already set up their own investigative agencies. Currently, niether the FAA or any other governmental body investigate reports of unidentified flying objects in the United States. The countries represented by the panel participants were: Belgium, Canada, Chile, France, Iran, Peru, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Former Arizona governor Fife Symington II, who moder- ated the event, told about his UFO sighting in 1977 during his second term as governor: “I saw something that defied logic and challenged my reality. I witnessed a massive delta-shaped craft that silently navigated over the Squaw Peak area in north Phoenix in the evening and it was truly breathtaking. To my astonishment, it appeared to be a solid structure; it was huge; it had a very distinctive leading edge with huge embedded lights in it; and was traveling quietly through the Arizona night sky. I still don’t know what it was. As a pilot and a former air force officer, I can definitively say that this craft did not resemble any manmade object that I’ve ever seen. It was certainly not high altitude flares as put out by Luke Air Force Base, because I’ve never seen International Press Conference on UFOs held at National Press Club in Washington D.C. By Sally Petersen I am Dr. Anthony Choy, founding member of the Office of Investigations of Anomaluos Aereal Phenomena (OIFAA), and an investigator for this office. This agency was established by the Peruvian Air Force in December 2001. I am the author of “Project 33,” the first Integral study on the UFO phenomenon in Peru. I traveled all over my country for about three years, speaking with witnesses, obtaining audio-visual information such as photographs and videos, and collecting data for this study. Photo by Bernard Thouanel UK pilot Ray Bowyer presents his statement at the National Press Club in Washington D.C. Anthony Choy describes Chulucanas Peru Incident at Press Conference flares fly in formation. The incident was witnessed by hundreds, if not thousands, of people in Maricopa County and in sourthern Arizona. I was never happy with the silly explanation.There might very well have been military flares in the sky that evening, but that certainly wasn’t what I or my fellow citizens saw.” The event was organized and sponsored by James Fox, who was the executive producer of the UFO investigative movie Out of the Blue, and by journalist Leslie Kean, who recently won a FOIA lawsuit against NASA to release the 1965 Kecksbery UFO related document (see page 5). For complete transcripts of all the testimonies, go to http://www.freedomofinfo.org/national_press.htm The statement of one speaker, Dr. Anthony Choy, is presented below. On October 13, 2001, in the northern city of Chulucanas, and before hundreds of people, eight spheres of light, of an intense red-orange color, were recorded on video. We were the first ones to obtain this video and we gave it to the air force. These objects were suspended in the air for over five hours, moving in an apparently intelligent manner, and in absolute silence until they disap- peared. A few days later, on October 25th, the luminous tear-shaped object of some 25 meters diameter (approx. 80"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"December 2007 4 MUFON UFO Journal Preamble: We, the signatories below, with backgrounds and careers in government, aviation, or the military, hereby present this dec- laration as a result of our common experience and purpose. While on active duty, each of us has either been a witness to an incident involving an unidentified flying object or has con- ducted an official investigation into UFO cases relevant to avia- tion safety, national security, or for the benefit of science. We use the term “unidentified flying objects” (UFOs) simply to mean any airborne phenomena that cannot be identified or explained, a definition first used by the U.S. Air Force in the 1950s. We make no claim as to the nature or origin of these objects. While most UFO sightings can be explained as misidentifications of known objects or natural phenomena, those governments that have studied them, including some with which these signatories have been on staff, have consistently found that a small percentage of sightings defy conventional explanation. Reports of these incidents often involve credible witnesses such as police officers, military personnel, pilots and air traffic controllers, and include solid, official docu- mentation. Therefore: We believe that for reasons of both national security and flight safety, every country should make an effort to identify any object in its airspace. Especially after the attacks of 9/11 it is no longer satisfactory to ignore radar returns for which no transponder data are available and/or which cannot be associ- ated with performances of existing aircraft and helicopters. While civil aviation radars and air traffic controllers mainly rely on secondary radar, military air defense radars should be configured such as to detect and track any object in the air, even when static or operating at very slow or very high speeds. In this regard, we refer to the incident that occurred at O’Hare International Airport in November, 2006 when a metallic disc was observed hovering over the United Airlines terminal for several minutes. Since it was not detected on radar, the Fed- eral Aviation Administration declined to investigate. The FAA also did not accept the many corroborating reports from United Airlines pilots and other personnel at face value, dismissing the sighting as “weather.” We suggest that prejudice against the term ‘UFO’ and against reports of unknowns could lead officials to dismiss sightings that involve unconventional air- craft or unmanned aerial vehicles engaged in espionage or ter- rorist activity, especially when radar returns are not available. However, important sightings have also been ignored when ra- dar is not a factor. Even though hundreds of citizens witnessed a massive triangular object traveling over Arizona in 1997, the International Declaration to the United States Government Facilitated by the Coalition for Freedom of Information November 12, 2007 U.S. government ignored inquiries from state officials about the incident, and never offered the public any explanation about this invasion of US airspace by a strange, unknown flying ma- chine. We believe this kind of disengagement represents both a missed opportunity and a potential risk. We maintain that a restive, concerned public has the right to be informed of the facts about UFO incidents that are well- documented and involve multiple witnesses. In addition, sci- ence lacks potentially important knowledge that may be gained by the study of these events involving objects demonstrating speeds, maneuvers or other characteristics that challenge our current scientific paradigm. Call-to-Action: We, the undersigned, ask the United States to join in coopera- tion with those governments which, recognizing the reality of unidentified flying objects and related aviation safety concerns, have already set up their own investigative agencies. Follow- ing in the footsteps of its now defunct Project Blue Book, we propose that the United States Air Force reopen its research effort, or that the National Aeronautics and Space Administra- tion initiate such a research effort, to address the international concerns stated herein, provide needed reassurance and in- crease scientific understanding. We call on the United States of America to engage with us and with currently active officials around the world to address this problem in an ongoing dialogue, beginning with the gathering of some of the signatories below in Washington, DC on this 12 th of November, 2007.

This announce- ment comes after CFi’s careful review of 36 pages released by NASA hours after SCI FI Channel announced its unprecedented support for legal action against the government agency. “The documents released shed little light on the incident, but are indicative of how hard NASA is trying to prevent the public from finding out what really happened on December 9, 1965,” said CFi attorney, Lee Helfrich with the Washing- ton, DC firm of Lobel, Novins, and Lamont. In another development, last week the National Archives notified researchers for CFi and SCI FI that the U.S. Air Force had declassified some of the records requested. “Our researchers are now poring through these 2800 pages to determine if any are relevant to the Kecksburg incident,” said Ed Rothschild, Director for the Coalition for Freedom of Information. According to Helfrich, “The day after CFi’s press conference (October 21) and on the eve of the airing of SCI FI’s Kecksburg documentary (October 24), a NASA official contacted me to say the agency was forwarding 36 pages of documents responsive to our FOIA request and apologized somewhat too profusely that it had ‘overlooked’ sending out the results of its research at an earlier date.” “CFi was determined to give NASA the benefit of the doubt and to assume that the agency conducted a reasonable, good faith search—especially given that NASA itself had decided back in June that its initial response to CFi’s FOIA request was woefully inadequate,” continued Helfrich. “But our trust in NASA’s reliability proved to be far too generous. It is difficult not to conclude that NASA’s response was simply a ploy to undercut the force of CFi’s press confer- ence and the audience for its documentary on Kecksburg.” “NASA’s stonewalling leaves us no choice,” said Rothschild. “We intend to file a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Dis- trict of Columbia in the coming weeks – as soon as our attor- neys tell us that we have officially exhausted all administrative procedures so as to comply with the requirements of the court.” SCI FI Channel’s Hammer also announced that on Friday, November 21 at 9-11 PM (ET/PT), SCI FI will broadcast “Kecksburg UFO: New Evidence,” a new special on the Kecksburg UFO incident with updates on the lawsuit, as well as new information and interviews that shed more light on the mysterious 1965 crash. NASA continues to stonewall on Kecksburg: Newly released documents raise more questions, say Sci Fi and CFi In new development, 2800 pages of declassified Air Force records are released to CFi and SCI FI from US archives International Declaration to the United States Government Continued from page 4 Editor’s Note: For a complete discussion of the Kecksburg case, see Leslie Kean’s article for the Inter- national UFO Reporter, “Forty Years of Secrecy: NASA, the Military, and the 1965 Kecksburg Crash, ” at http://www.jerrypippin.com/kecksburg%20(2).pdf"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"December 2007 6 MUFON UFO Journal MUFON 2008 MUFON has a long illustrious history that goes back almost forty years. Founded in 1969 by Walt Andrus and John Schuessler, MUFON has grown into the premier UFO investigative organization in the United States today. Over 2500 members strong, with a team of 800 plus field investigators and 100 plus consultants and research specialists, MUFON is still on the cutting edge of UFO investigations and research. Looking forward to 2008, MUFON will be implementing a number of new initiatives that will only enhance its capabilities and status in Ufology. These dynamic improvements have been alluded to in past Journal issues, but they are laid out in detail in this special holiday edition. By James Carrion, International Director Walt Andrus John Schuessler James Carrion MUFON Leadership When many think of MUFON’s leadership, what comes to mind is the International Director—from Allan Utke, to Walt Andrus, to John Schuessler, to myself. What you may not realize is that MUFON is governed by a Board of Directors that works behind the scenes to ensure MUFON’s viability as an organization. The majority of the board members serve on their own time and at their own expense, as the only paid salaries in MUFON are those of the International Director, the MUFON Business Manager and Four of the nine current MUFON Board Members: From left: John Schuessler, Jan Harzan, Bob Wood and Clifford Clift. the Journal editor. Board members attend face-to-face board meetings twice a year, paying their own travel costs. Why do they do this? The answer is simple—they wholeheartedly believe in MUFON’s mission and goals and work diligently to make sure that MUFON is properly governed through long term strategic planning. The MUFON board consists of nine members: James Carrion (International Director), Tom Whitmore (Corporate Treasurer), Tom Deuley (Corporate Secretary), John Schuessler (International Director Emeritus), Clifford Clift, Jan Harzan, Judy Orsatti, Rob Swiatek and Bob Wood. Complementing the board and ensuring MUFON meets its operational goals are the three MUFON Functional Directors: Chuck Reever, Director of Investigations, Robert Powell, Director of Research, and Alejandro Rojas, Director of Public Education. Please read in this issue of the Journal the initiatives and projects that these directors are diligently working on. At the State level, MUFON would not exist if not for the volunteer efforts of our State and Assistant State Directors and State Section Directors. These individuals volunteer their time to host public meetings, recruit new members, meet with the press and manage local MUFON investigations, all on a nonpaid volunteer basis. (See page 21 for a list of all State Directors.) Complementing the state leadership are the members of MUFON’s investigative network, the Chief Investigators and Field Investigators who are our eyes and ears in the field. It is through their volunteer efforts that MUFON continues to collect quality report data that is then used in MUFON’s research efforts. MUFON investigators have not only invested their time and money in becoming certified as an investigator but also continue to conduct investigations on their own time and at their own expense."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"      7 MUFON UFO Journal December 2007 MUFON 2008 New MUFON Headquarters We are pleased to announce that MUFON has put on a professional face and is now operating out of a formal office complex. The new address is 155 E. Boardwalk Dr., Suite 300, Fort Collins, CO 80525. The new phone number— which will always be answered by a live receptionist—is 970-232-3110. You can still call the 888-817-2220 toll free number and connect to headquarters when inquiring about membership, merchandise or other questions. MUFON Headquarter’s business hours are Monday through Friday, 9AM to 5PM Mountain time. The new MUFON office is located at 155 E. Boardwalk Drive in Fort Collins, Colorado. New Business Manager MUFON has recently hired a new business manager, Lori Steele. Lori has worked for other nonprofit organizations in the past. She brings her extensive office management and excellent customer service skills to MUFON. Lori is excited about working for MUFON as UFOs are her passion. You can always reach Lori by phone at 970- 232-3110, or by email at lori@mufon.com. Lori Steele MUFON mission:Investigate Chuck Reever says, “Being the Direc- tor of Investigations gives me the opportu- nity and pleasure to talk with our state directors, field investigators and other volunteers to determine how MUFON can best be of service to them. My day is a success if I can help a state director or field investigator better understand MUFON’s Case Management System and MUFON objectives. It is most important for me to inform our volunteers and others that MUFON cares about them and their role in our mission. There is a great amount of satisfac- tion in supporting in any way possible the state director and their staff and help enable them to do the best job they can.” Deputy Directors of Investigation MUFON now has two Deputy Directors of Investi- gations: Jim DeManche, who is responsible for managing all unaffiliated MUFON Field Investigators (in states that do not have a MUFON State Director), and our Deputy Director of Investigations for the STAR Team who will remain anonymous (see STOV team, next page). Chuck Reever Director of Investigations Continued on page 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"December 2007 8 MUFON UFO Journal MUFON mission:InvestigatE STOV Team MUFON has also formed the Special Team Operations–Veritas (STOV) to conduct special investigations at the request of the MUFON International Director. Veritas is the Latin word for truth and the STOV team’s job is to get at the truth as quickly as possible so that we can answer questions from the public. The STOV team will conduct investigations into high profile allega- tions that surface on the Internet or elsewhere in the UFO community. You may remember the bogus allegations last year that the 1953 Kinross jet and the UFO it was chasing had been found at the bottom of Lake Superior. It was only through hundreds of hours of investigation that MUFON was able to be the first to declare these allegations false. Another example would be the recent California Drone photos and videos that were reported to MUFON and the related CARET reverse engineering claims. STOV team members will work virtually from their homes and coordinate their activities through email and the Internet. STOV team members will consult with MUFON consultants and research specialists as needed. One of the key differences between the STOV and the STAR teams is that STOV team members will operate anonymously, and will be known only to select individuals in MUFON. This anonymity will allow them to conduct their special investigations without fear of harassment. STAR Team MUFON’s new Strike Team for Area Research (STAR) is our rapid response force— a small contingent of MUFON members who can be called on a moment’s notice to deploy to the scene of a significant UFO event, to collect immediate primary data from witnesses and from the scene. The STAR team will travel with its own complement of high tech modern equipment such as a Geiger counter, laser range finder, magnetometer, Gen-1 night vision binocu- lars, etc. Coordinated by the International Director and deployed under his command, the STAR team will be MUFON’s boots on the ground if a Roswell-type event, for example, were to occur. If you have the available time and the investigative background to be part of the STAR team, email your qualifications for consideration to hq@mufon.com. Forensic Investigations Field Investigator’s Manual 5.0 – Chuck was tasked with creating a new version of the MUFON Field Investigator’s Manual that focused more on the forensic nature of investigations. In the past, MUFON collected primary data from witnesses and corroborative data from other sources to come to a plausible explanation for what was witnessed. MUFON will continue to do so, but the investigative process will be of a forensic nature where each sighting is treated like a crime scene. MUFON investigators will learn new techniques such as scene preservation for collecting physical evidence, chain of custody handling of evidence, and witness profiling techniques. As a scientific research organization, MUFON has an obligation to collect quality data that withstand scrutiny by both the public as well as the scientific community. The new Field Investigators Manual will be available in late spring 2008 and investigator training using the new manual will be conducted at the MUFON 2008 Symposium. CMS Enhancements MUFON’s Case Management System (CMS) continues to undergo improvements thanks primarily to coordinator Jan Harzan and CMS developer Tomas Karlsson. Tomas is our volunteer of the month for December 2007 and is featured in this issue of the Journal . An important change that will be made this year is programming CMS to implement MUFON’s new three tiered sighting categories.

The key word in our mission statement is “scientific,” as our investigative techniques and research projects strive to adhere to scientific standards. One of my personal goals has always been to bridge the gap between Ufology and mainstream science. A Meeting of the Minds workshop was held in March 2007 to explore ways of engaging mainstream scientists in the study of UFOs. Director of Research Robert Powell: “I have been the MUFON Director of Research since May of 2006. I accepted this responsibility with a willingness to do my best to improve MUFON’s research capabilities in the area of Ufology and MUFON’s stature within the scientific community. Although MUFON is a non-profit organization, I treat my role and responsibili- ties like any of my previous jobs in the semiconductor and chemistry fields. My responsibilities include many of the mundane tasks that occur in any job such as developing projects and goals, maintaining deadlines, writing reports, attending MUFON business meetings, etc. But the opportu- nity to contribute in an area of scientific study which has always interested me, and to meet and work with experts in the field, is my true reward. We have launched the UFO History Project Team and held the first meeting of the team. We are also in the process of identifying team members for the UFO Abduction Team. Both of these teams will be examining their respective area of Ufology using objectivity and scientific principles. There will be more developments in the area of research in the months to come. Please feel free to email me with any questions, ideas, or concerns. My email address is powell@mufon.com. I look forward to working with all of you.” MUFON also has a new Deputy Director of Research, Ron Regehr, who is assisting Robert in forming the MUFON Abduction Team. MUFON Consultants and Research Specialists MUFON has an extensive network of consultants and research specialists who assist MUFON in its research efforts. A MUFON Consultant must have a doctoral level degree whereas a Research Specialist must have a master’s level degree. MUFON History Team MUFON has recently formed the MUFON History Team to research the phenomenon from its earliest days. Robert Powell pulled the team together and the team is headed up by Franklin Woodruff. The team will review the historical role of official government involvement in UFO investigations. The team goals are to: I. Provide a general overview of what is known regarding official UFO investigations. II. Identify, obtain, analyze and publish important historical information. The team will be identifying government archives that may contain relevant declassified documentation and will assign personnel to spend research time in these archives. In addition, the team will be looking at the official documentation stored in MUFON’s own archives that were recently electronically archived as part of the MUFON Pandora Project. The team had its initial meeting in Dallas, Texas on November 3, 2007 and From left: History Team members Richard Thieme, Mike Swords, Jan Aldrich, Tom Tulien, Franklin Woodruff, S teve Purcell, Robert Powell, Erik Kubik (not pictured) Robert Powell Continued on page 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"December 2007 10 MUFON UFO Journal MUFON mission: educate The public clamors for information on the UFO phenom- enon and looks to MUFON to provide answers to their questions.

MUFON acts as a beacon of light in this sea of misin- formation to help the public navigate through these muddied waters. Educating the Public MUFON has embraced the digital world. In addition to our informative website at www .mufon.com, expertly managed by our webmaster Pamela Cisneros. MUFON also has an online presence at the MUFON Message Boards at http:// mufonmembers.proboards55.com. Since its inception in January 2007, the message boards have amassed over 2,500 members and 12,500 posted messages! MUFON member Patty Donahue graciously volunteers her time to moder- ate the message boards. MUFON also now has an online presence at Yahoo NewsGroups at http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ MUFON/ . This group is managed by MUFON’s Director of Public Education, Alejandro Rojas.

Sally Petersen writes: “Since I became Editor of the MUFON UFO Journal in January, I’ve become im- pressed by the dedication of many researchers, experiencers and interested persons who have volunteer their time and efforts for disseminating information and furthering the scientific study of UFOs. My goals for the Journal have been to create and maintain a professional look, to impecca- bly edit the many submissions, to encourage contributions, and to provide up-to-date and pertinent UFO information. Our goal is to be able to send the Journal out early enough that you will receive it at the beginning of each month, and we are looking at printing options that would allow the Journal to be in a sleeve or envelope so that it reaches you in prime condition. Thank you to those who have submitted articles and book reviews this past year. If you would like to submit something for consideration in the Journal , please contact me at Editor@mufon.com for a copy of the Writer’s Guidelines.” Alejandro Rojas Sally Petersen will be working diligently until their next face-to-face work session at the MUFON Symposium in July, 2008.

No, I don’t mean the American rock band. Rather, I’m talking about the mysterious balls of light that were reported by nervous Allied pilots toward the end of World War II. These small, glowing spheres would zoom up from the ground and tag along with our planes. Their presence spooked our fliers, of course, but they seemed otherwise harmless. By the end of the war, they stopped showing up. While this got quite a bit of press at the time, the phenomena more or dwindled to nothing, becoming just one more mystery. End of story. Well... not quite. Some sixty years later, a number of researchers are telling us our govern- ment and their allies were less than candid with the public. (I know that comes as a shock to everyone.) It seems there was more to the Foo Fighter story than we were told. Let’s examine just what the airmen saw. Strange lights dog our pilots One typical report of balls of light came from the crew of a B-29 bomber belonging to the 415 th Night Fighter Squadron, based at Dijon, France. On November 23, 1944, lieutenants Ed Schlueter, pilot; Donald J. Meiers, radar observer; and Fred Ringwald, intelli- gence officer, saw what looked to be stars, but these stars soon became orange balls of light. “There were eight to ten moving through the air at a great speed.” These objects could not be picked up by radar, either ground-based or from the plane. The lights then dis- appeared, only to reappear further off. 1 While pilots in the Pacific also saw these strange light balls, it was the European campaign which got most of the attention. The common mythology has it that American fliers named these things ‘Foo Fighters’ based upon a pre- war comic strip character named Smokey Stover, who frequently quipped, “Where there’s foo, there’s fire.” It could have been an adulteration of the French word for fire, feu . 2 Other pilots used the term kraut balls instead. One B-17 pilot, a veteran of more than fifty missions, remembered encountering the Foo Fighters on many occasions. “Suddenly, they’d be on our wing, six or eight of them, flying in perfect formation. You turn and bank, they turn and bank; you climb, they climb; you dive, they dive. You just couldn’t shake them. Little, dirty-grey aluminum things, ten or twelve feet in diameter, shaped just like saucers—no cockpits, no windows, no sign of life. When the things finally got sick of the game, they would just take off into space and disappear, flying at the most incredible speeds.” 3 Pilots saw these objects in daylight and at night. Hundreds of reports were made Between April 1944 and August 1945, hundreds of reports like these flooded Allied headquarters. The common assumption was that Ger- many had managed to launch one of their super weapons , yet the question remained, why didn’t they attack? Interestingly, after the war, allied forces learned that German pilots had experi- enced the same kind of flying light balls, and they assumed it was a new American device. Many writers on the topic of UFOs will declare that the modern era of UFOs can be traced to the Foo Fighters of World War II. Others cite Kenneth Arnold’s sighting in 1947. As the world eagerly transitioned from war to peace, interest in the Foo Fighters waned. Through a combination of government secrecy, the absence of new Foo Fighter sightings, and the passage of time, most people came to view these apparently benign fire balls as evidence of extraterrestrial visitors. However, it didn’t start out that way. Were the Foo Fighters German? Throughout the later part of the war, Hitler and his top aides had promised to unleash an arsenal of technologically advanced new weapons which would turn the tide and destroy their enemies. For example, in Novem- ber 1944, Herman Goring himself, in describing one of the long promised new weapons, in this case an air defense, announced to the neutral press that, “...their bombers will drop by the dozens, like sparrows under the hunter’s gun. Our fighter pilots will only have to press the trigger.” 4 The German public believed, at least at first, that if they were patient, all would be well. Apparently, Allied commanders believed that super weapons were imminent as well. The invasion of Europe by America and its allies and the subsequent push to reach Germany itself were matters of great urgency. Time, it seemed, was critical. But with the Nazis in retreat, their command structure fractured, and their supplies and resources critically short, one has to wonder; what was the big rush? There is good reason to believe Allied commanders feared German super weapons, as the Nazi SS seemed almost ready to put several of these systems into operation. Despite strong, even ground-breaking security mea- sures, information kept leaking out of Germany. Reliable intelligence reports had for years kept the allies, especially the British, aware of Germany’s exotic weapons research. And it was indeed exotic. German scientists were working on various death rays, laser weapons, electric or rail guns, magne- tic waves to stop engines, atomic devices, advanced rockets beyond the Foo Fighters Revisited By John B.

I have no doubt that German scientists worked on a wide range of futuristic weapons. Many historians believe that if the Nazis could have held out a few more months, the war might have turned out differently. As it is, they ran out of time, and the super weapons were never effectively used. For this reason alone, German technology seems an unlikely explanation for the whole of the Foo Fighter phenome- non—which was experienced far beyond the boundaries of German interests. Let’s consider something less well known. Two detailed and different accounts The following mission report was submitted to Headquarters VII Bomber Command (Pacific Theatre) on May 2, 1944. Observations: The crew of plane #616 over FALA ISLAND, TRUK ATOLL, at 021802Z observed 2 air- borne objects at their 11,000 altitude changing from a cherry red to an orange, and to a white light which would die out and then become cherry red again. These objects were out on either wing and not within range of caliber .50 machine guns. Both followed the B-24 through all types of evasive action. A B-24 took a course for GUAM, and one of the pursuers dropped off at 021900Z after accom- panying the B-24 for an hour. The other continued to follow, never approaching closer than 1000 yards and speeding up when the B-24 went thru clouds to emerge on the other side ahead of the B-24. In daylight, it was seen to be bright silver in color. As the B-24 let down at GUAM, the pursuer took a course of 330 degrees at 15,000 feet to 20,000 feet altitude at 022130Z. One B-24 encountered eight intense flames light green in color, one of which burst and hung at 5,000 feet at 021013Z. There was no trail or warning until the actual burst. A B-24 reported 9 to 10 red tracer type trails of fire up to 5,000 feet. They came in pairs and one pair came within 50 to 100 yards of the tail of the B-24 at 021010Z. Source of each pair was at a different location . 5 Not all sightings during World War II were by pilots, and not all occurred in that last year. The following account is a less typical Foo Fighter story, as told by Stephen J. Brickner, a sergeant with the 1 st Marine Division. He was in bivouac with his squad in the southern Solomon Islands, west of Guadalcanal, on August 12, 1942. It was a bright, tropical morning, with high banks of white, fleecy clouds. I was cleaning my rifle on the edge of my foxhole, when suddenly the air raid warning was sounded. I immediately slid into my foxhole, with my back to the ground and my face turned up to the sky. I heard the formation before I saw it. Even then, I was puzzled by the sound. It was a mighty roar that seemed to echo in the heavens. It didn’t sound at all like the ‘sewing-machine’ drone of the Jap formations. A few seconds later, I saw the formation of silvery objects directly overhead. It was quite easy to mistake any- thing in the air for Jap planes, which is what I thought these objects were. They were flying very high above the clouds, too high for a bombing run on our little island. Someone shouted in a nearby foxhole that they were Jap planes searching for our fleet. I accepted this explanation, but with a few reserva- tions. First, the formation was huge. I would say over 150 objects were in it. Instead of the usual tight ‘V’ of 25 planes, this formation was in straight lines of 10 or 12 objects, one behind the other. The speed was a little faster than Jap planes, and they were soon out of sight. A few other things puzzled me; I couldn’t make out any wings or tails. They seemed to wobble slightly, and every time they wobbled, they would shimmer brightly from the sun. Their color was like highly polished silver. No bombs dropped, of course. All in all, it was the most awe-inspiring and yet frightening spectacle I have seen in my life . 6 So, what do we know? It seems, based upon a variety of sources, that several observations can be put forward with reasonable certainty: 1. Virtually all Foo Fighter encounters caused no harm to the humans involved. 2. While reports from the European theatre during 1944 and 1945 received the lion’s share of publicity, UFO reports came from all war fronts and from all war years. 3. German technology was incredi- bly innovative and very dangerous. However, the Nazis ran out of time to make most of this technology opera- tional, and many UFO reports came from the other side of the world, beyond German interests. 4. During the entire period of World War II, there seems to be no reports of Foo Fighters or their ilk observed on the ground and no reports of contact with UFO occupants 5. The descriptions of the flight characteristics of Foo Fighters and their ability and propensity to play cat and mouse games with our pilots sound much like UFO reports from later decades. 6. When intelligence reports regar- ding the bizarre Foo Fighters reached American and British commanders, their first priority was to assess the threat. Both apparently decided there was no threat. We see this ‘threat assessment’ approach in the decades to follow. In summary, there is no valid reason to separate the Foo Fighter phenomena from other reports of UFO activity, before or after the war.

Germans may have used some of their exotic weapons toward the end of the war, but no mater how generously we regard their technological progress, they can’t have caused all that was reported. Over and over in these reports, the inescapable conclusion is that some- thing was watching us closely as we engaged in global combat. They even showed up over the invasion of Normandy to observe the fighting. Foo Fighters are a chapter in a book that is still being written. Bibliography 1. Story, Ronald D.

But the location of the impact site itself, where the greater portion of the craft came to ground, has always been very much in dispute. My purpose here is not, unfortu- nately, to settle exactly where the impact site is, but rather to show, by way of a little elementary mathematical physics, what is feasible and what is not, in terms of distance from the debris field and in terms of some working assumptions about the object’s initial air speed and altitude that are not inconsistent with witness accounts. A good many theories have been put forward about the impact site. As a professional mathematician I feel compelled to point out that, whatever the merits of this or that theory, some good solid scientific thinking can be brought to bear on the matter. After all, trajectory feasibility is fundamentally a matter of the physics of objects moving in a gravitational field. If in “dead fall” how far can it go? The central question is a straight- forward one that lends itself quite readily to analysis: if the Roswell object indeed lost self-propulsion at the moment of trauma over the debris field, becoming a ‘dead’ missile propelled only by its own forward momentum subject to gravitational deceleration, how far down-range could it have fallen? We will denote this down-range distance (measured in feet, for consis- tency of units) by x . It is a matter of simple science that x (aside from the effects of atmospheric friction, which for purposes of simplicity we will take to be relatively inconsequential) is a function of the initial altitude (which we will call h , measured in feet) and of the initial The Roswell Object: How Far Down-Range? by Donald R. Burleson, Ph.D. velocity at the moment of trauma (which we will call v , measured in feet per second). The full equation of motion for the parabolic arc that such an object would typically follow is shown in Figure 1, where y denotes the momentary altitude of the object when it is at a distance x down-range. This equation applies to any ‘dead’ object propelled forward, like a cannonball shot out of a cannon that is tilted at an angle A . However, we may greatly reduce this equation by making the simplifying assumption that the initial flight angle was zero (level flight—there is certainly no other equally natural assumption about the angle) and by putting y = 0 for the moment of impact. The symbol g is a gravitational constant approximately equal to 32 ft/sec/sec. The equation then simplifies algebraically to the statement h = v (SQRT h)/4, where for typographic expedience ‘ SQRT h ’ means the square root of h . (Note that, naturally enough, the higher the air speed and the higher the altitude, the greater the down-country ‘drop distance’ x .) Thus given an initial velocity (air speed) v and initial altitude h , one may obtain a serviceably good approximation to the distance an object could fall down-range, by hypothesizing some value of v and some value of h , and then multiplying v by the square root of h and dividing by 4. Obviously, in doing such computations, we should prefer to use hypothetical values of v and h that are reasonable in terms of consistency with what witnesses saw, the actual v and h of course being unknown. (At least unknown to private citizens; there may have been radar tracks, which if so are still classified.) For example, it can be shown that a hypothetical air speed of 1,700 miles per hour at an altitude, say, of 4,000 feet would take the pre-trauma object all the way across the sky in about five seconds, a scenario not out of keeping with witness experiences. By contrast, one would not hypothesize an air speed like 8,500 miles per hour, because this (at the same altitude) would take the object across the sky in less than a Continued on page 13"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"      15 MUFON UFO Journal December 2007 second, so that a person who blinked would probably miss seeing it at all. But people did see it. The same concern applies to altitude; the object that people saw might well have had an altitude of 4,000 feet but almost certainly not an altitude like 35,000 or 40,000 feet. That is to say, there are (roughly) feasible ranges of values one might realistically assume for air speed and altitude, and correspondingly one may compute feasible intervals describing the distance down-country the object would most likely have fallen. For example, suppose we estimate, hypothetically, that the initial air speed ( v ) might well have been between 1,700 and 3,500 miles per hour, i.e. (to use the units necessary here) between 2493.33 and 5133.33 feet per second. Likewise, suppose we estimate that the initial altitude ( h ) might have been between 2,500 feet and 6,500 feet. These values may sound a bit arbitrary, but they are not wholly so because, again, one must try to be consistent, or at least not inconsistent, with witness observations. At the low end of these air speed and altitude intervals, we may put v = 2493.33 ft/sec ( = 1,700 mph) and h = 2,500 ft in the above simplified formula to obtain a down-range drop distance of x = 31166.63 feet, or about 5.9 miles. At the high end of the air speed and altitude intervals, we may likewise put v = 5133.33 ft/sec ( = 3,500 mph) and h = 6,500 ft to obtain a drop distance of x = 103465.57 feet, or about 19.6 miles. The implied band of feasibility Thus, roughly speaking, under the assumed initial ranges of values for air speed and altitude, the implied band of feasibility for the down-country drop range works out to be between 6 and 20 miles. The details of this band of feasibility depend, of course, on the hypotheses one entertains about the air speed and altitude, so that the more realistic those assumptions are, the more reliable a band of feasibility one obtains for the probable impact site. And all of this assumes the premise that the object lost its own propulsion at the moment of trauma over the debris field and became a dead-fall missile. We may certainly use these physical principles to determine, at least, that some scenarios are more probable than others, and that indeed some scenarios are for all practical purposes not possible at all, in terms of the combina- tions of assumptions (about altitude and velocity) involved. Some UFO investigators have enter- tained theories to the effect that the impact site may actually have been at locations some 40 miles (211,200 feet) distant from the debris field. The difficulty with this—at least if one supposes that the object lost its own propulsion—is that if one proposes realistic values for the initial air speed, then (with a drop distance of 40 feet) one gets an unrealistic initial altitude, and vice versa. For example, if one assumes an initial velocity of 3,000 mph = 4400 ft/ sec, then for the drop distance to have been 40 miles down-range, the object would have needed an initial altitude of about 36,900 feet, which is not consistent with witness accounts. (At slower speeds the inconsistency is worse. At v = 2,500 mph = 3666.67 ft/ sec, for example, a drop distance of 40 miles would require an initial altitude of h = 53,100 feet.) Conversely, if one assumes, for example, an initial altitude of 4,000 feet, a drop distance of 40 miles would require an initial air speed of about 13357.46 ft/sec = 9,100 mph approximately, and the trouble with that air speed is that it would take the object (at that altitude) only about 94 hun- dredths of a second to cross the sky from horizon to horizon, so that an observer might well not even have seen it. Again, this is inconsistent with witness experiences. Does all this mean that the drop distance could absolutely not have been 40 miles? No, but it does mean that if we somehow knew that the object did fall to earth that far from the debris field, then (again assuming air speed and altitude to have been something consistent with witness accounts) in that scenario we could reasonably assume that it must not have lost self- propulsion altogether, but rather continued to move at least in part under its own power, not just by forward momentum. What is more or less likely Clearly, these observations do not tell us exactly what happened, but they tell us combinations of things that could not have happened, or are much less likely than other combinations. For example, the object absolutely could not have encountered its fatal trauma at the debris field at an air speed of 1,800 miles per hour at an altitude of 5,000 feet and lost its own propulsion and yet managed to drop to earth 40 miles away. (If we do complicate our mathe- matical model by taking atmospheric friction into account, a drop distance like 40 miles becomes even more infeasible.) With this reasoning, we arrive not at a unique understanding of precisely what happened, but at an enhanced understanding of what things are more or less likely to have happened. Some hypotheses account for the known facts better than others do; this is the way science teaches us to think. The laws of physics are what they are, and they do apply. ogether with witness accounts, these principles constitute our best strategy. In general, in the field of UFO studies no less than in any other field, hard science is what we need to do if we want to find out the truth. Dr. Donald R.

Friedman Stanton Friedman By Stan Friedman Over the past several months I have done a host of radio interviews mostly because of the outstanding efforts of the PR company (Warwick Associates) helping to promote the new book Captured! The Betty and Barney Hill UFO Experience by myself and Kathleen Marden, Betty’s niece. One recent show was a bad experience as two hosts were attacking me at the same time. Neither had read the scientific literature, but both seemed to have been briefed by Noisy Negati- vists Incorporated, dredging up every false argument about abductions, inter- stellar travel, alien behavior, government cover-ups, ad nauseum . Often their arguments took on a probabilistic tone: Isn’t it improbable that aliens would be humanoid in form? Isn’t it very unlikely that sophisticated alien vehicles coming here from many light years away would crash? How likely is it that the govern- ment would keep secret proof of the existence of another civilization? Wouldn’t it be impossible that such a secret could be kept by thousands of people? You get the idea. The two hosts were constantly interrupting with false claims. The experience reminded me of how often such false arguments are made. With regard to crashes we have no informa- tion on how often they occur since the government, with its systems such as satellites and radar for detecting them, isn’t telling us. In addition, all the reports I have heard seem to involve small Earth Excursion modules which seem to spend their time near the planet, rather than the very large mother ships coming from other solar systems. Normally to estimate probability one must have facts and data. Gamblers are well aware of the likelihood of tossing a pair of dice to get a particular number. The possibilities are obviously limited to a number between 2 and 12. One is much more likely to toss a 7 than a 12. Blackjack players know there are only so many face cards in a deck. We take for granted that many very unlikely events will indeed take place. Lightning bolts have struck in the same place more than once. Some people have won the lottery more than once. It is very unlikely that a sperm will unite with a particular ovum, but 4 million babies will be born in the United States this year. Very often we fail to recognize the difference between random events and events having a common cause. For example, only one in 10,000 males has hemophilia. One might think that the probability of two brothers both having hemophilia is 1 in 100 million (1/10,000 times 1/10,000). Wrong. It is a gene- tically transmitted disease; so on average half of the sons of a carrier would have the disease. Many families have more than one hemophiliac. Why are Aliens Humanoid? The question of the possibility of alien visitors being humanoid is an interesting one. If we had both a catalog of types of alien beings and travel schedules for their interstellar vehicles, we could, in theory, calculate the probability that the next alien visitor would be 3 or 7 feet tall, would have 1, 3, or 5 arms, and so on. Unfortunately, we have no such catalogs. We do have some data that might be useful in esti- mating probability. We know, for example, that just about all mammals have four limbs—not three or five. Note that tiny mice and huge elephants have four limbs, one tail, two eyes, two ears, one nose. We notice that the sense organs seem to be grouped at one end and not randomly distributed. We note that all these critters seem to have a variety of organs on the inside of skin rather than on the outside. It would appear that certain arrangements are almost universally in place. The denier would say, “But how could anybody out there where presum-ably, evolution is different, also wind up being humanoid?” One possibility is that they are humanoid because the advantages are universal. The laws of physics and chemistry certainly seem to be similar, based on near and far observations. The same elements and isotopes appear everywhere, judging by measurements made of star characteristics both near and far, from tens of light years away to billions. They don’t seem to be randomly distributed at all. Did Aliens Colonize Earth? Of course there is another possi- bility. Perhaps ancient civilizations have colonized the neighborhood and we are the result of colonization and migration millions or billions of years ago. The families of most Americans migrated here certainly within the past thousand years from a host of different countries. There were many different reasons for migrating. The different ancestors could all interbreed. Consid- Ufology and Improbability"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"      17 MUFON UFO Journal December 2007 Ufology and Improbability Continued from page 14 ering that the earth was a suitable place for colonization by beings roughly similar to us—air breathers not ammonia breathers, ingesters of protein and carbohydrates etc.—for well over a billion years, there may have been many different colonies here, perhaps some destroyed by natural disasters, by wars or other causes about which we know nothing. Theories based on Bishop Usher’s chronology involving creation of the planet and its life forms on October 23, 4004 BC, wouldn’t allow for such past migrations or for devasta- tions like nuclear winter, an asteroid collision or other unknowns. How can a debunker say it is unlikely secrets can be kept when we have so many examples in which black programs were conducted in secret for a long period of time and involving thousands of people and billions of dollars? Think the Poppy and Corona spy Satellite programs—each kept secret for decades and each involving loads of people and dollars. We hear about the secrets that eventually are released, not those which haven’t been released. Based on the past it seems very likely that eventually we will find out about many more huge highly clas- sified programs. Daniel Ellsberg released the Pentagon papers. How many other whistleblowers do we know of who have released many classified documents? Very few. Deniers have said that surely it is unlikely that beings from different places (little guys, reptilians, and so on) would all come to this place out in the boondocks at the same time. Native Americans would certainly note that within a few hundred years, “alien visitors” deluged North and South America, coming from Spain, Portugal, England, France, Holland, Italy, Norway, Sweden and other countries. There are many different motiva- tions for the visitors. For all we know there is some sort of local galactic federation (an advanced form of the United Nations) that lets all the civili- zations in the neighborhood “know” that Earth has moved very rapidly with the development of weapons of mass destruction and methods for delivering them, therefore standard measures must be taken to assure that civiliza- tions in the neighborhood are not threatened by this primitive society whose major activity is tribal warfare. I personally believe that all civilizations are concerned about their own survival and security and are probably very much aware that societies like ours in the past have been a threat to the good folks nearby. I think the local galactic federation library probably maintains records of other civilizations that have been a threat to their neighbors. We Earthlings can hardly claim that we are really just nice guys. In the absence of travel schedules, it may well be that we are the least visited place in the neighborhood. Probablity of Visitation Once on a radio show a gentleman with a PhD in physics called in to say that the probability of a visitor coming here from elsewhere varies inversely with the square of the distance—from four times as far away it would be six times less likely. This is as absurd and silly as saying that the probability of a plane flying to Chicago from San Francisco is only 1/100 th of the proba- bility of flying from San Francisco to Fresno because Chicago is 10 times farther away. Airlines don’t fly at random. It is not equally likely that they will fly in any direction. The pattern of settlement in a country is NOT equally likely for each square mile. Consider how many cities were located near rivers and ports. Consider that the USA, China and Canada all have about the same land area. But Canada has 35 million people, the USA has 300 million people and China has 1.3 billion. Hardly a uniform distribution. A false argument against alien visitors half a century ago was based on the notion that planets result from near collisions between stars. There-fore, the conclusion was that there would be very few planets because stars are so far apart and we must have the only civilization. Now we know that planets seem to be very common, judging by the more than 200 that have been detected so far. It is not reasonable to conclude that all must have intelligent life since temperatures, gravitational forces and other factors may not be at all appropriate for the development of civilization. The press sometimes tries to claim that these discoveries make it more likely that there is life out there. This is silly. Either there is life out there or there isn’t. Detecting more planets helps us understand that our solar system seems not to be unique. It tells us nothing about who is where. An important probabilistic pro-UFO argument can be made in terms of the outstanding research by Marjorie Fish with regard to the Star map observed by Betty Hill as described in Captured . The pattern stars all turned out to be sun-like stars. But only about 5% of the local stars fill those criteria. In addition, all the sun-like stars in the well-defined region of space taken up by the map are part of the pattern. The probability that all the sun-like stars are part of the map and that all the pattern stars are sun-like seems very small considering that there are about 250 stars in the volume of the map—chances are less than 1 in 10,000 that this is a coincidence. Furthermore, it would seem very unlikely that all the pattern stars would be in a plane, but they are. In short, be wary when a denier proclaims some thing is impos-sible or unlikely. Flight in airplanes, in rockets, to orbit, to the moon were all proclaimed as improbable by noisy negativists who were flat out wrong. fsphys@rogers.com www.stantonfriedman.com"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"December 2007 18 MUFON UFO Journal Filer’s Files Filer’s Files Filer’s Files Filer’s Files Filer’s Files By George Filer Director, MUFON Eastern Region Note: These reports are presented in order to keep readers informed of some of the vast number of sightings being reported.

Holmes Comet Erupting (Nov. 7) Astronomers in Japan and Europe report that Comet 17P/Holmes is undergoing a spectacular eruption. The 17th-magnitude comet has brightened by a factor of five hundred thousand or more over the last week becoming a naked eye object in the evening sky. This may signify a breakup of the comet’s core or a rich vein of ice suddenly exposed to sunlight— no one knows. Look for a yellow 2.5th- magnitude fuzzball in the constellation Perseus after sunset. (“2.5th magnitude” means a little dimmer than the stars of the Big Dipper.) At present the comet looks more like a star than a comet; it does not have a discernable tail, but it might grow one as the outburst continues. Visit http://spaceweather.com. NASA scientists also report they discovered a fifth planet orbiting 55 Cancri, a star outside our own solar system and say the discovery suggests there are many solar systems that are, just like our own, packed with planets. The new planet is much bigger than Earth, but is a similar distance away from its sun. Michigan Flying Triangle and Disc Photos JACKSON – Marilyn Ruben writes, “On Wednesday, October 24, 2007, I was driving home from work, when I was compelled to take photos of the pretty autumn trees with my Motorola cell phone camera. Today while downloading the pictures, I was surprised to see seven pictures containing an unidentified object in the sky. In the first picture, the object is partially obscured by trees to the right of the highway. In the second photo, the object is over the road. I was driving north on Interstate I- 27 after 5 PM, when the object crossed the highway flying west. There are 5 more similar photos, where the object continued showing up in the pictures.

An image taken 15 minutes later when the webcam updated the UFO was gone which seems to eliminate camera flares. I have seen this type of UFO before in this area on the web cam as many other types. You yourself can see them too they are here every night. CAMELBACK MT. – On November 23, at 6:15 PM, a close up photo was taken of the tower with a UFO hovering to the left.This image [taken November 24] at 7:45 PM, one hour and thirty minutes later [after an 6:15 webcam shot] shows the unidentified flying objects holding their position while the Moon has moved [out of the frame]. The Earth rotates at 15 degrees per hour, all celestial bodies therefore appear to move, but these objects hovered over Phoenix from 6:30 to 7:45 PM. Flares held up by parachutes would soon land. Based on the web cam photos, even helicopters would have difficulty holding position for over an hour, thus we have UFOs hovering over Phoenix.

Had a dark mass with no visible wing or tail structures other than pronounced light visible under and forward of the object. I could have hit the underside of the object with a baseball if I had one in my hand at the time. The object could not be heard until it was almost directly overhead approaching me from the south and there was no detectable sound when it got about 100 to 150 feet to the North of me. The object moved very slow over the rooftops of our block and straight towards the Superstition Mountain range.” Continued on page 19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"      19 MUFON UFO Journal December 2007 Filer’s Files Continued from page 18 Connecticut a Strange UFO Sighting TORRINGTON – At 4:30 AM on Novem- ber 17, while at work, I looked out the window from our seventh floor unit and noticed a bright light. I thought it was a helicopter because the hospital often has patients picked up via Life Star out of Hartford CT. It wasn’t moving and it ap- peared to be swaying slightly side to side. I immediately called my co-workers to take a look and the security guard too. We couldn’t tell the shape but it was a bright light which actually dimmed and slowly went out a few times but came on again. My co-workers reported red and green lights at its base and even report seeing a laser like spot moving along the mountain side. We didn't see this laser directly from the object but it covered such a large area on the mountain so quickly that it had to come from something of distance. This object just sat there for 1 1/2 hours. It appeared to move higher as it got closer to morning and I didn’t have time to watch where it went because I had to get back to work. I’ve never seen anything like that before and wow do I now believe. Thanks to Brian Vike - Director of HBCC UFO Research, http://www.hbccufo.org/ Florida SAINT AUGUSTINE – On November 22, 2007, around 8 PM, my wife and I were driving home when we both saw the same George Filer Interacting Galaxies APR 87. Thanks to Hubble Telescope/NASA and http://www.stsci.edu/institute/ Copyright large white formation flying above us. It was so large that the lights covered both sides of SR 16. We followed it but it was gone. I went outside after we parked at home, and about ten minutes later three Air Force planes flew low and slow over our house. The airplanes were coming from the north, this was the same direction the lights were coming from. Thanks to Brian Vike - Director of HBCC UFO Research, http://www.hbccufo.org New Jersey Bright Light Shining on My House JERSEY CITY – While I was sleeping at 2 AM, on November 23, 2007, a very bright oval light was directed at our house. It was positioned in such a way that I saw it as soon as I opened my eyes, shin- ing down on me through the window. The light filled up the whole room and re- mained there for about two hours. The minute I saw the light I was sure it was directed at me, but I did not feel threat- ened, and fell back asleep immediately. I only remember thinking, “I have to check if there is a streetlight that could cause this?” But at the same time, I knew al- ready that it wasn't a streetlight as it was too bright. I woke up about two hours later, and the same oval object was still present, shining down on me. I fell back asleep and woke up at 5:30 AM, when it was gone. I checked for lamps, streetlights, or any object that could have caused the light but could see nothing but the open sky. The object was situ- ated above the treetops, or above our neighbor’s house. It didn’t move. It seemed to be investigat- ing or searching some- thing. Thanks to MUFON CMS. Investigation: I spoke with the witness on November 24, 2007. She is very interested in UFOs and apparently conditions were right for the misidentification of a natural phenomenon. The sky was ex- ceptionally clear and the moon was almost full and very bright. It just happened to be in position to shine in her bedroom win- dow lighting up the entire room. Oregon Diamond Shape Object EAGLE POINT – I was at my girlfriend Brittney’s house and we decided to go out and watch the stars so we went out and laid down on a blanket. We watched a big object moving down and across the sky. At first, we thought it was just an air- plane, but as it got closer and we could see it was a big diamond shaped craft with glowing lights that appeared to be hover- ing like it was taking in information about what it was looking at. I felt so afraid I started crying because I seriously thought it was aliens or something but then it started going away. Thanks to MUFON CMS Pennsylvania Formation of Craft PHILADELPHIA – I was looking out of my living room window observing the stars with my Celestron binoculars when movement caught my eye. I focused on a ‘V’ formation of seven craft with three more in a circular formation to left, and one on the right flank. They looked like lightly glowing whitish gray ovals almost translucent like a jellyfish. I said to my wife, “They are flying in formation, look there.” They were moving towards us in a straight line about twice as fast as a commercial jetliner from the NE to SW, I observed them for about seven seconds as they flew over our house. I ran out back with my binoculars to try and track them but I lost them in the bright moon- light. They made no noise, and seven or more human aircraft would have made some kind of noise. I have lived here for twelve years only a few miles from the Continued on page 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"December 2007 20 MUFON UFO Journal Philadelphia Airport and have never seen any planes take that flight path. Commer- cial aircraft do not travel in formation and there were no blinking lights or beacons, and they traveling too fast for birds. Thanks to MUFON CMS Texas Video of UFO HOUSTON – I was turning the pool filter on when I noticed a bright blinking light like a star. Upon further investigation with high power binoculars I saw many lights revolving around a craft. The craft changed shapes frequently and darted and dashed around the sky. At one point it was joined by two more. I signaled the craft with my pool light and then with a laser pointer at which point something flew about twelve feet directly over my head so quickly that had I blinked I would have missed it. I watched it for nearly two hours when they just blinked and disappeared. This sighting was also witnessed by my friend at my home. I also called my friend across town who then went outside and observed the same craft. I felt very excited but also a sense of peace from this sighting. As I watch the video over and over it gives me peace. Thanks to MUFON CMS Argentina Thirty Meter Round UFOs MACACHÍN – Ufologist Fabian Romano, member of the Centro de Estudios UFO en La Pampa (CEUFO) furnished details these cases. At 21:00 hours on Novem- ber 7, 2007, Juan Bautista Menna, a chi- ropractic surgeon arriving in Macachin visibly excited, contacted CEUFO’s local representative. Menna, states, “My vehicle Filer’s Files Continued from page 19 experienced a power outage while driving on Provincial Route 18, so I pulled over to the roadside and tried to get out of my car, and saw a powerful light above me.” Menna stated, “It was over my head, 30 meters in diameter, round, and gave off intense heat. The object flew over a lagoon and headed north, decreased in luminous intensity and engaged in a ‘light show” with horizontal and vertical swinging movements.” The object flew behind a hill, but a strong glow remained when two cone-shape ob- jects with bases appeared, issuing intense, intermittent flashes lighting up the entire field. These UFOs headed northwest toward Santa Rosa. Menna started his car again and resumed his journey and noticed a light be- hind him that made a strange maneuver. He made a U-turn, and noticed an intermittent light with a glow that lasted some 40 min- utes. At that time, two truckers who worked for the Gutierrez silo factory reached the site, and also witnessed the UFO. Two police officers answering calls from the Doblas Rural Patrol arrived, and also saw the luminous phenomenon. The next day, November 8, about 10 PM, a couple from Macachin had an in- tense light approach the road from the right, that rose into the air in front of them, “made two pirouettes” (two circles) and vanished. They were still stunned by this when two minutes later they witnessed a similar UFO: a cone with a rounded base. (Translation (c) 2007, S. Corrales, IHU.

At a certain moment the plane was hit by something which damaged the right wing and cockpit jeopardizing the safety of the pilot. The pilot succeeds to land the plane. The initial investigation could not deter- mine what hit the plane, initially they thought that it was a bird, but at 21,325 feet MUFON Members Message Board mufonmembers.proboards55.com Password: Hynek1947 (case sensitive) this hypothesis was excluded. The plane was flying over 800 Km/Hour which makes that the images that were captured during the flight to be fuzzy. Still you can notice four unidentified flying objects. The pilot cannot explain what hit him and his unit commander will ask the se- cret service to help them understand what happened since they have the technology to analyze the footage taken by the on board equipment. The pilot says that it could not be a bird because if that was the case he could see that. His commander says that we got hit by a flying object that could not be identified. Pretty much the whole dialog in the movie is a reiteration of what is written in the article. Thanks to Chris Barton Filer’s Files is copyrighted 2007 by George A. Filer, all rights reserved.

Con- gratulations to Cheryl Ann Gilmore (South Carolina) , Jim King (Iowa), Steven Purcell (Tennessee), for being 1st, 2nd and 3rd respectively in the month of November. The top 10 State Directors are highlighted. The report is based on our two measures of UFO Investigation effectiveness: assigning reports within 72 hours of receipt, and completing all investigations within 90 days of being assigned. The “Assigned” column is a six- month running average of the number of cases assigned within 72 hours divided by the total number of cases received in that six month period. The “Completed” column is the number of cases completed beginning sixty-two (62) days back and going back six months from there (for a total of eight months back) divided by the total number of cases reported in the same period. The “Weighted Rank” is just the average of the two columns expressed as a percent. State Directors can improve their scores by being sure to assign all cases within 72 hours, and to follow up with their Field Investigators to ensure all reports are completed within 90 days. To be considered complete, a report must have been investigated and placed in one of the three com- pleted status codes (Unknown, Hoax or IFO) by the State Director.

The climax occurred on August 6 of 2004 when, in collaboration with the American television channel Univision, we were able to record for 55 minutes a distant object of unknown nature and origin, moving at great velocity in the sky, going up and down, and right and left.
