[{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"UFO OBSERVED AT CWE RANGE IN MO. By Ted Phillips, Jr. At 7 am Feb. 14, 1968, an object of un- known origin was observed on the ground in a very rugged area of south-central Missouri. The following report is taken from a taped interview with the writer on Feb. 17, and a copy has been sent to Dr. J. Allen mek, Air Force Scientific Consultant on UFO's. It was 7 em and the sky was quite clear and bright; no stars were visible. The observer was walking towards a large barn located some 100 feet east of his house, when he noticed one of his cows looking out into a field behind the barn. He then observed the UFO on the ground some 335 feet from h:m. At this point he uas l~oEr! through several scattered trees. He moved to the ~ortheast corner of the bm andP up to this point, he thought the object was a parachute. On moving a few feet further, he saw several small \"objects\" moving under the UFO which was 285 feet from him. The observer said the \"cbjects\" rere movlr? qdte repidly; they seemed to have arms, also moving at a high rate of speed. It was the observer's opinion these small objects were mt human. They seemed to be about the same color as the UFO, with novisible neck, head, or legs; however, he was some distance may and the objects seemed to be about two and a half feet tall. The UFO was setting on a sheft only slightly taller than the objects. The observer started through the first fence, at this point 210 feet from the UFO the mall objects started moving around behind the shaft and entering it on the side may from him. \"As I came through the first gate, I picked up two rocks, pretty good size, one of them was. I got up there to about 30 feet *om it and it was setting there, kind of rocking slightly. The wind was blowing out of the east, and I thought, 'Boy, here goes, I'm going to knock a hole in that thing and see what the hell it is!'

What was the curious formless hulk tht glowed like a reflector? Reeidente of Veshon Island pondered theae questions yesterday in the aftermath of an icy \"flying saucer'' incfdent. Setting for the eerie tale wes a gravel pit on the island. At .2 am Sunday morning a group of is- land teenagers noticed a flash of llght near the pit. Going to investigate, the boys saw an object \"about the size of ti cm,\" tb-ah ita form was indescribable. The \"thing\" sent off a bean aboct the size of a car's headlight. Frightened, they sought out a Kifig County deputy sheriff, and brought him to the gravel pit. It had vanished when they returned. Biit the water in the grm-el pik, &out 50 feet from edge to edge, was covered with two inches of ice. Yet other bodies of water near the pond had no ice in them. lest this tale sound like a lark, instead of a flying saucer report, it is supported by King County sheriff's deputy Don Holke, whom the boys had summoned. Holke said the ice still waa thick enough to walk on Sunday afternoon. And he added another brief thought: \"The ice was clear, and a funny thing; it had no water on top of it although it was rain- ing all day.\" NMT MONTH Scientists receiving signals from outer space.

RUSSIAN SCIENTISl! SPEAKS OUT Part I1 (continued fhm ~pril) From February issue SOVTET LIFE The belief that UFOs are real is also born out in the fact that these enigmatic objects me not only visible to the naked eye, but have distinct imsges on photogra- phic plates and are recorded by such impar- tial \"witnesses\" as radar screens Air Force Major Eaidukov, on a night mis+ sion above the Odessa Region on April 4, 1966, noticed on the screen of his plane's radar a strange object which was also spot- ted by ground-based radar units. Within 15 uinutes &he object dropped from 31 to 18 mileei and in the next quarter of an hour to 11 miles, The UFO remained unidentified. Maneuver and pursuit'. The well-known - SovLet pilot, chief navigator of Soviet polar aviation Valentin Akkuratov, describes one of his encounters with flying discs: \"In 1956, engaged in strategic ice recon' naissance in a TU-4 plane in the area of Cage Jesup reen en land), we dropped down from the clouds to fair weather and suddenly no- ticed an unknown craft moving on our port- side parallel to our course. It looked very much like a large pearl-colored lens wi.th wavy pulsating edges. At first we thought it was an American aircraft of an unknown des:Lgn, and since we did not want to en- counter it we went into the clouds again. After we had flown for 40 minutes toward Betxr Island, the cloud cover ended abrupt- ly; it cleared ahead and on our portside we saw once again that same unknown craft. Wing up our minds to see it at close quarters, we changed our couse abruptly and began the approach movement, informing our base at Amderma of %he maneuver. When we changed our course, the unknown flying machine followed suit and moved parallel I at our speed. \"After 15 to 18 minutes of flight the unknown crafi sharply altered its course, sped ahead of us and rose quickly until it disappeared in the blue sky. We spot;l.ed no aerials, super-structure, wings or porthcYLes on that disc. Nor did we see- an exhaust gas or condensation trail. It flew at what seemed to us an impossible speed.\" :No Pre'judices'. Until recently no sci- entific study of UFO3 has been made in the Soviet union; More tha that, the prevail- ing and, in my opinion, .mistaken view was that UFOs are common optical phenomena in the Earth's atmosphere.

MORE MEN BELIEnJE IN SAUCERS' According to a recent issue of the TULSA DAILY WORLD, a survey conducted by a Tulane University political science professor sbwr that more men than women believe in flying saucers from outer space. D-r. David R. Deener, who conducted the survey as a part of his class in space law, says that over q$ of Tulane's engineering students believe in flying saucers and are 100% in support of the U.S. space program and believe the United States should spend the money necessary to beat Russia in get- ting a man on the moon. A freshman class at Wesleyan University in Wddletown, Conn., is conducting a study of the UFO phenomena under the leadership of Prof. Thornton L. Page who was a member of the Robinson Investigating Committee on UFO's, 1952. The class has served as a prototype for newly established courses at other univer- sities. The students have heard talks by Dr. J. Allen Wek, Dr. James. McDonald and other UFO inves-clgators and have appeared on local TV discussion program. So much interest is being show in the course, some students have already decided to go in further research after college. ( Credit: FLYIlVG SAIJCER OBSERVER) . ADVERTISE IN SKYIX)OK, SEE PAGE FIVE!!!

The next rock I thought I would throw on top of it and it just hit something and bounced.\" I (the writer) then asked the observer if he could hew any sound. He said he could not. He said that he could see no se& or rivets. \"It just looked like a big shell, a gra,yish-green looking outfit, and under- neath it were these oblong holes where the lights were combg out. They were so bright you couldn't see when you got up there. I thought I was going right up to it. Igot up to about here\" (about 15 feet from the UFO) \"and there it was--I just walked up against a wall! I couldn't see it at all, there was jut a pressure. \" \"When it took off, .it just rocked back and moved real fast to the left of that ridge. It made no sound at all and disappeared in seconds. The shaft was pulled up into it as it took off. The growid was real muddy, but it didn't leave any marks at all.\" \"How long did you see the object?\" I asked. \"It was about five minutes.\" \"Did the object look like it was metal?\" \"I never seen anything like it, it look- ed like a shiny silk or something, 1 never seen anything like it before. It shined, sort of, like silk or something, I couldn't tell. I was going to tell though if I could have hit it with that rcck.\" I then asked him about the lights. \"They were underneath the rim of it, there were several, they were changing colors so fast you couldn't tell har many there were. They were 6 or 8 inches long and about a foot a;part, they were all the colors of the rain- bow. \" Ed's note: This is one of the most inter- esting sightings reported in our state, to our knowledge. Ted Phillips visited the scene of the sighting, walking over the fields with the farmer, who wants no publi- city, and measuring and photographing the area.

In 156e the Nauka Publishing House of the -1SS.R Academy of Sciences is scheduled to bring out a book titled POPUUTED OUTER SPACE, edited by *****. The anthology will have a special sec- tion devoted to the UFO problem, with contri~utions from American scientists Joseph Hynek, James McDonald, Jack Valley and Frank Salisbury, ssticles by Soviet writers and UFO observations made in the Soviet Union. Soviet observations of UFOs, like those I cited earlier, were not taken from a sys- tematic collection of information of this kind; they were spontmeous responses to zy article in SMENA. This fact wasrants'the conclusion that there have been many more WO observations in the USSR. We have alreadj collected some dozens of well-documented reports and accowits. In MR~ 1967 a sponsoring group of sci- ent,ists, the military, writers and public figures met to form an unofficial body whose purpose it would be to conduct a preliminary scientific investigation of . UFOs. **-H* The organization set up October 1967, is called the UFO section of the All-Union Cosmonautics Committee, with headquarters at the Central House of Aviation and Cosrnonauti.cs in tbscow. Air Force Major General Porfri Stolyarov was elected chairman of the section. Those of us who are participating in this new and exciting program have an am- bitious program of work ahead. The first step will be to organize the collection of reliable informaklon of UFOs. That will be done at the outset by^ the existing systema of astronomical, meteorological and geo- physical observatories, satellite and space- rocket tracking stations and the radar in- stallations of civilian airports and the hydrometeorological service. All these or- ganizations can make UFO observations with equipment now available. In the design stage are special devices for photographing UFOs and record:Lng the radiation and magnetic disturbances which they may be responsible for. Guest from Other Worlds? The recorded - -.- observations 1.~i.11 serve to check hypotheses. These hypothese should not, in my opinion,, attempt, -to explain the nature of UFOs in terms of familiar phenomena. Judging by other surprises, nature has some in store n)r ua here too, and we must be ready for per- haps a radical \"reassessment of values.\" The hypothesis that UFO8 originate in other worlds, that they are flying craft from planets other than Earth, merits the most serious examination. Observations show that UFOs behave \"sensi- bly.\" In a group formation flight they main- tain a pattern. They are most often spotted over airfields, atomic stations and other very new engineering installations. On en- ccuntering aircraft they always maneuver so as to avoid direct contact. A considerable list of these seemingly intelligent actions give the impression that UFO8 are investi- gaking, perhaps even reconnoitering. Curioasly enough, the number of UFOs observations increases as Mars approaches the earth. Is that pure coincidence? Some people think that UFOs have appeared In the Earzh's atmosphere only during the past two decades. This is not the case. The UFO phenomenon has been observed throughout the history of mankind, there are medieval and ancient reports strikingly similar to ours. Among the earlier UFO reports, as an ex- ample, may be the well-documented observations of a large saucer in 1882 ad a \"procession of bolides\" in 1913. These reports still a- wait investigation. The mosz remarkable UFO phenomenon is the famous \"Tungusky meteorite.\" In recent years Soviet scientists have established that the Tu~?gusky explosion had every parameter of an air nuclear blast. The USSR Academy of Sci- ences Reports (volume 172, Nos. 4 and 5, 1967) have studies by Alexei Zolotov to prove that the Tungusky body could not be a meteorite or a comet. In the Sumner of 1967 the Joint Institute of Nuclear Research at Dubna published a study by Vladimir Mekhedov, who concludes that the Tungusky blast left considerable residual radioactivity , Finally, as recently as 1966, after analyzing the sum total of observations on the Tungusky body's flight, this writer showed that before the blast the Tungusky body described in the atmosphere a tremendous arc of about 375 miles in extent (in azimuth), that is, carried out a manuever. All these new results warrant the conclu- sion that the Tungusky body seems to have been an artificial flying craft from another planet. Sould this be finally confirmed by investi- gations now in progress, the significance of the Tungusky diaster would be inestimable.

FROM PAGE FOUR But this, incidentally, will pose new problems, If we are indeed being studied by creatures from other planets, what is their purpose? Why are they so stuiously avoiding any direct contact? Is their un- sociability the result of so high a level of development that they study us from that \"height\" just as we look upon and study ants? Or is there still the possibility of common understanding since we are born in the same Universe and obey the same laws of nature ? Yes, there are many questions, but all are in the distant fbture. Our study of UFOs may lead to quite different conclu- sions and present mankind with q~jite differ- ent problems. The important thing now is for us to dis- card any preconceived notions about UFOs and to organize on a global scale a calm, sensation-free and strictly scientific study of this strange phenomenon. The subject and aims of the investigation are so serious that they justify any efforts. It goes with- out mying that international cooperation \"is vital,. - UFO's IN NEW JERSEY On the night of March 25, some 25 pepaons, including four policemen and a minister, re- ported seeing two unidentified flying objects hovering over Metuchen, New Jersey, and the police followed the objects for about a mile before they disappeared, According to a story in the ARKANSAS GAZETTE, March 27, the Rev.
