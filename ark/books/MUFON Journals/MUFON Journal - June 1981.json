FROM THE EDITOR We had hoped to have this issue published before the 1981 Boston MUFON UFO Symposium, but most people will receive it after the meeting is history. Printing delays and vacation schedules intervened. Coverage of the Symposium will be included in the August or September issue. As an example of cooperation among UFO groups, we intro- duce this month the first of a series of quaterly plotting maps for U.S. sightings. We congratulate Gayle McBride of the Tarheel UFO Study Group, North Carolina, who persuaded the represented parties to share sighting data for this purpose.

Friedman, and arch saucer critic, Philip J. Mass on February %l, 1981. Nearly 400 people attended the debate in Trinity's Laurie Auditorium sponsored by the Trinity Students Activity Committee and Professor of Astronomy, Dr. Michael Hart. Hart also chaired last year's University of Maryland astronomer's conference on the question of extraterrestrial life, \"Where Are They?\" Friedman was the evening's first speaker and led off by arguing that the evidence that some UFOs were indeed spacecraft of an extraterrest- rial origin and manufacture was now overwhelming. Various parties, Friedman charged, including U.S. government and military intelligence agencies, were actively involved in a Cosmic Watergate, an on-going coverup designed to keep secret the knowledge that UFOs exist in phys- ical reality. Friedman, a nuclear physicist with 14 years research experience in various government and industrial highly classified projects, is prob- ably the country's foremost pro- ponent of the theory of extraterrest- rial UFO origin. He claims he is the only known space scientist devoting full time research to the UFO phenomenon. His opponent was Philip J. Klass, senior avionics editor of Aviation Week and Space Technology journal. He is also an original UFO panel member of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP), a panel which also includes well-known UFO skeptics, Robert Sheaffer and James Oberg. Klass is the author of two flying saucer books, UFOs - Explained and UFOs - Identified, and also serves as an editor for the Committee's quarterly journal, \"The Skeptical Inquirer.\" Klass 1 maintained that there has yet to be a UFO reported that, when. subjected to close enough scrutiny, does not fail to have behind it a prosaic, if admittedly sometimes ex- ceedingly rare, source or stimulus. According to Klass, UFOs can be anything from meteors to more exotic meteorological phenomena like \"sundogs\" and atmospheric plasma, or ball lightning. They can be hallucinations or misapprehen- sions of untrained witnesses. They can be temperature inversions on a radar screen or common celestial objects seen under unusual condi- tions. They can even be outright fabrications and hoaxes, said Klass. In fact, they can be just about any- thing at all except convincing proof that the planet is being surveyed or visited by extraterrestrial intelli- gence capable of interstellar travel. As a classic example of how even the best of high-strangeness UFO reports can turn out to have a mun- dane explanation, Klass spent the first 30 minutes of his time analyzing the famous near collision between'a cigar-shaped, redly glowing UFO and an Army Reserve helicopter piloted by then Captain Lawrence J. Coyne the night of October 18,1973, near Cleveland, Ohio. A Blue Ribbon Panel of \"The National Enquirer\" newspaper later awarded the heli- copter crew $5,000 as a prize for \"the most scientifically valuable UFO re- port of 1973.\" Klass admitted that, on the sur- face, the circumstances seemed to be strange enough. The October night in question, Captain Coyne had been at the controls of a Bell UH-1H (Huey) helicopter on a routine flight from Columbus, Ohio, to the crew's home base in Cleveland. Three other crewman were also aboard. The chopper was traveling at a speed of 90 knots, 2500 feet above sea level. 1200 feet above the actual ground surface below.. At 11 pm, one of the crewman noticed a curious red light off to the east. Coyne told him to \"keep an eye on it.\" Thirty seconds later, the red light shot straight for the helicopter on a collision course. Its speed was estimated at 600 knots, or about 700 miles per hour. Coyne tightened his grip on the controls and urged the helicopter into an abrupt dive. Now the red light had stopped directly above them and the entire crew looked up through the helicopter's roof panel windows in wonder. The thing remained motionless for 10 or 12 seconds. One of the crew said it looked like the \"hull of a dark submarine\" as its oblong form blot- ted out the easily visible stars. All aboard could see the red light at the nose of the odd object, and several other attached lights reflecting off its dark surface. Suddenly, a pyramidal, or tri- angular-shaped beam of green light shone down on the helicopter, light- ing up the interior. Coyne now not- iced that his chopper, instead of descending, was rising, at almost a thousand feet a minute! Whatever the thing was, it abruptly shot off to the west and disappeared from view, having been in continuous sight for a period of 4 to 5 minutes. And what it might have been, of course, depends on which side of the UFO debate the individual inter- preter happens to fall. To Philip Klass, not unexpectedly, the explan- ation was obvious. Coyne and his crew had seen a particularly brilliant and sustained fireball emanating from the annual Orionid meteor shower which generally occurs on (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Debate, Continued the nights of October 21 st and 22nd. And it is entirely understandable, Klass continued, that the helicopter crew should react in alarm and con- fusion to the startling sight, so much so that they obviously misinterpret- ed the subsequent events and time factors involved. The green light flooding the cabin of the helicopter, for example, was caused not by a beam of light of that color, but be- cause the flash of the fireball itself was filtered through the rooftop window panels which are them- selves tinted green! Klass also focused on several other discrepancies he said he de- tected in the crew's account of the frightening encounter after a pas- sage of two and a half years. Coyne, in particular, later said that the heli- copter's magnetic compass had be- gun to spin wildly in the course of the near collision and had to be replaced. Another crewman said the compass had not been affected dur- ing the event. The chopper's radio- man had also tried to contact one of several nearby military installations at the time of the sighting and had failed to raise a response. Nothing overly, mysterious about that, either, Klass noted; the onboard radio unit had a short range and simply could not cope with the distances involved. encounter, a fact that Klass \"conven- iently\" failed to mention. Rather than engaging in a lenghty rebuttal of Klass' explanation, how- ever, Friedman quickly moved onto material he considered more urgent, including a review of numerous law suits undertaken by individuals and saucers groups alike under the Freedom of Information act. One such suit currently under way seeks the recovery of 135 classified docu- ments in the archives of the National Security Agency (NSA). Govern- ment attorneys have already admitt- ed that the documents do exist, but have taken strenuous steps to see that they are not released to the general public. A 21-page summary of the documents was shown to the presiding judge in a closed-door session. Friedman, of course, alleges Friedman was courteous and succinct in his rejoinder. Since his UFO encounter, it was pointed out, Coyne had been promoted to Lieu- tenant-Colonel, hardly the kind of recognition the Army Reserves would bestow upon a helicopter pilot guilty of the errors of observa- tion and judgment with which Klass charged him. Friedman also noted that several independent ground observers had confirmed the UFO sighting at the time of the Coyne that the legal manuevers are, the latest in a series of on-going cover- ups conducted by the government to withhold conclusive evidence of the physical existence of UFOs. In his own rebuttal, Klass would reply that the NSA was the govern- ment intelligence agency charged with the translation of classified communications intercepted from (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"AIR FORCE \"MODEL\" UFO By Don Berliner The first major study of a large collection of UFO reports was the puzzling \"Special Report 14,\" which covered more than 3,000 reports received by the U.S. Air Force in the first 5 years of its Projects Sign, Grudge and Blue Book — 1947-52. The data used in the re- ports were the Air Force's, but the conclusions were those of Battelle Memorial Institute, a private scienti- fic research organization in Colum- bus, Ohio, which performed the study on a $100,000 Air Force contract. When it was released to the pub- lic in 1955, Special Report 14 attract- ed little attention, as the press chose to base its stories on the report's very conservative conclusions and summary, rather than on the intrigu- ing but hard-to-read tables, graphs, and charts. As a result, few people realized at the time that almost one- quarter of the 3,201 sightings had been declared \"Unknown\" by the Battelle scientists. Instead, the public had little choice but to accept the conclusions of the accompanying Air Force press release which im- plied that only 3% of all the sightings had not been explained as conven- tional phenomena or illusions. One of the more interesting ideas explored in the report was the at- tempt to construct a model of a UFO, using the descriptions of what they felt were the \"Best Unknowns\" a- mong the hundreds they had deter- mined were unexplainable. The Battelle conclusion was that it was impossible to derive a model of a \"flying saucer\" that fit all the re- quirements of consistency. The im- plication was that this reduced the chances of there being a category of real, unknown devices responsible for a significant number of reports. The validity of the effort can be called into question on several ac- counts, any one of which causes one to wonder if the study was truly objective. The statement that \"suffi- (Continued on next page) Debate, Continued Soviet, Chinese and other foreign powers. To reveal their contents, he charged, would show the public not so nearly much about flying saucers as about America's intelligence gathering capabilities. Klass then showed slides of numerous already de-classified documents from var- ious security agencies which indi- cated that if a saucer conspiracy were indeed in effect, individual agencies such as the CIA and the Department of Defense were as ig- norant of its existence as everyone else. Klass also said that it would be a physical impossibility to maintain a secret of such magnitude as the sup- posed fact that the U.S. government has in its possession a crashed saucer or retrieved alien corpses. Friedman also stated that the famous Barney and Betty Hill ab- duction case offered convincing proof that an extraterrestrial intel- ligence was engaged in biological experiments involving human spec- imens. The single most convincing element of the case, Friedman re- iterated, was Betty's ability, two and one half years after her frightening abduction experience, to redraw an alleged star map she had seen while on board the alien spacecraft. The map was sketched out while Betty was under the influence of a post-hypno- tic suggestion. Astronomer Marjorie Fish later constructed hundreds of three-dimensional star maps of our near-neighbor suns using recently corrected star distance data before she arrived at a controversial verifi- cation of Betty's map. Fish's work indicated that the aliens were from either Zeta One or Two Reticuli, two sun : like stars separated by a gap of only 3 light weeks. Friedman con- tended that such a situation of rela- tive proximity between one solar system and another would be highly conducive to the development of space travel technology by an intel- ligent life form inhabiting a planet in either system. After Friedman had finished speaking, Mass scored one of the more dramatic points in the debate by approaching Friedman's table with his own \"star map.\" If Betty Hill could accurately recreate a map from memory two and one half years after the alleged incident, would Friedman be willing to sub- ject his own memory to_a small scientific test? Would he kindly glance at the drawing Klass held up to the audience, study it for 30 se- conds, and then recreate it from memory? Friedman declined, of course, after noting that Betty Hill had re- drawn her map while under the care of Dr. Benjamin Simon, a prominent New England psychologist and trained hypnotist. The fact of the map's existence spoke for itself, Friedman concluded. So who really won the \"inside\" debate? Probably no one. As no less an authority on the subject of UFOs than Dr. J. Allen Hynek once said: \"I was trained as a scientist, not as a lawyer, and in any case I don't see how a difficult scientific question can be properly addressed within the limitations of the debate format, . which reduces everything to a sim- plistic either-or position and makes no allowances for the real complexi- ties of an issue.\" The only thing that does seem clear at this point is that the UFO debate is bound to continue until a satisfactory resolution is made. It will continue in the front pages of the world's newspapers and in the hallowed halls of academia. And it will continue in the woods and fields of the world whenever people look up and see something strange in the nighttime sky. Something they can't readily identify. D"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"AF Model, Continued ciently detailed descriptions were given in only 12 cases\" makes ab- solutely no sense to anyone who has taken a more than casual glance at the accumulated cases of the first 5 years of the official investigation. There are many scores of reports containing as much, if not more information than the dozen selected for this special study. Just why these were chosen and others ignored cannot be determined at this late date. But even using these cases, a better job could have been done. In fact, there are so many errors in. reporting and drawing the objects from the 12 cases that serious doubt arises as to the capability and sincer- ity of those who prepared the sec- tion entitled; \"The 'Flying Saucer' Model.\" In an effort to show how distort- ed the attempt to derive a model was, we offer comments on each, along with considerably better ident- ification of each case than was pre- sented in Special Report 14. Best Unknowns Case I. July 29,1948; Indianapolis, Ind. Non-Technical witnesses James Toney and Robert Huggins. The two men said the object was propeller- shaped, yet the drawing in Report 14 looks like no known propeller. The witnesses refer to round cups on the object, yet the drawing shows most cups to be clearly oblong. The writ- ten description is of an object 6'-8' long and 2' wide; the dimensions with the drawing say it was lV2'-2' wide. The description is of an object with a radius-to-thickness ratio of 3 or 4:1; the dimensions are of an object witha ratio of 3 to 5:1; and the drawing has a ratio of just over 2y2:l. The final Project Blue Book conclu- sion was: Unknown. Case II. Apr. 20, 1952; Flint, Mich. The prime witness is describ- ed as a Naval aviation student, but the case file says he was a university student who had been a naval aviat- or. The description is of objects \"shaped like conventional aircraft,\" yet the drawing in Report 14 shows an airplane clearly lacking a tail! Despite the shape and the red glow surrounding the many glowing ob- jects, the official USAF conclusion was that the several witnesses had been watching birds. Case III. Jan. 20, 1951; Sioux City, Iowa. The witnesses were Mid- Continent Air Lines Capt. Lawrence Vinther, First Officer James Bach- meier, and control tower operators. The description is of an object \"like an airplane with a cigar-shaped body and straight wings.\" The draw- ing is of a pair of crossed hotdogs, with the \"wings\" shaped exactly like the \"fuselage.\" Despite some rather violent maneuvering, the USAF de- cided the excellent witnesses must have been observing an enormous B-36 airplane. - Case IV. July 19,1952; Madison, Fla. The witness was Ollie Daniel, a former U.S. Navy airplane mechanic. He described two \"cigar-shaped\" objects. The drawing is of an oval with a thickness ratio of just over 3:1, which is pretty fat for a cigar. Even though Daniel said the objects were lighted, had visible exhaust at one end, and maneuvered, the USAF said they were \"possible balloons.\" Case V. July 24, 1948; Mont- gomery, Ala. Witnesses were East- ern Airlines Capt. Clarence Chiles and First Officer J.B. Whitted. Their description was of a rocket-shaped object with two rows of lighted win- dows, and yet the pilot's drawing shows only vertical divisions with no indication of light, as (in his co- pilot's drawing. Even though the object was said to have climbed away steeply, the USAF said it was a meteor, apparently on the urging of the late Dr. Donald Menzel. Case VI. Dec. 22,1952; Banning, Calif. The witness was instrument technician Michael Fajack. This case file is missing from the Project Blue Book collection and so no analysis is possible. Case VII. June 6, 1952; Kimpo AFB, Korea. The witness was an unnamed USAF Flight Sergeant ( a term apparently coined by the au- thors of Report 14). The case file is missing from the Blue Book records, but is listed as \"Unidentified\" on a summary sheet. It was described in Report 14 as a thick disc: The draw- ing shows a thickness ratio of 3.4:1 and mentions proportions of 7:1. referring to dimensions from the observer's drawing, but never stat- ing any specific figures. Case VIII. July 31,1948; Indiana- polis/ Ind. Witnesses Mr. and Mrs. Vernon Swigert. (No notice is taken that it occurred less than 48 hours after Case I and in the same general area.) It is described as \"cymbal\" shaped, which suggests a flat bottom, but the drawing shows an upwardly curved bottom. Using the witnesses' dimensions, the object would have a thickness ratio of between 2.5 and 3.3:1, but the drawing is of a thinner object with a ratio of 3.7:1. The official USAF conclusion is: Unidentified. Case IX. Aug. 13, 1947; Twin Falls, Idaho. The witnesses were A.C. Urie and his sons Kenneth and Billie. The dimensions are of an object having a thickness ratio of 2:1, yet the drawings show ratios of 3.2 and 3.4:1, with no explanation for the variance. The witnesses describ- ed pods on the sides, while the side- view drawing shows loops or hand- les. There is no sign of flames com- ing from the pods, as mentioned by the witnesses. The USAF explana- tion of \"atmospheric eddy\" is credit- ed to Dr. J. Allen Hynek, who subse- quently disowned the idea. Case X. May 24, 1949; Rogue River, Ore. The witnesses were sev- eral employees of the Ames Aero- nautical Laboratories. The object was described as \"like a fifty-cent piece,\" \"pancake-like.. .somewhat thicker in the center,\" \"either com- pletely circular or somewhat oval... thin near the edges and thicker in the center.\" All witnesses described a small triangular fin extending from the middle and getting larger as it approached the rear. The drawing show a fairly thick circular disc with a fin resembling the one described by the witnesses. Estimated dimen- sions ranged from 25' in diameter, to the size of a C-47 transport plane (95' wingspan and 6.4' length); no (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"AN OPEN LETTER TO ROBERT SHEAFFER CONCERNING HIS NEW BOOK, \"THE UFO VERDICT, EXAMINING THE EVIDENCE\" May 4, 1981 Dear Bob, It was a pleasure to meet you and your family last week and I appreci- ate having a copy of your book. Your suspicion that I might not like it was correct. It would take too much time to tick off each item of weakness that I noted, but here are a few general comments: (a) The title and subtitle imply that the book is a comprehensive study of the subject leading to a rational conclusion. It falls far short of that. (b) You start with an unstated, but none the less obvious, promise that UFOs do not exist, then search for the necessary solutions to certain cases. With very strained arguments that ignore essential details you \"ex- plain\" the cases. Therefore, accord- ing to the book, you have proved that UFO's don't exist. We both know that you have an impossible mis- sion, that is, to prove that UFOs do not exist. On the other hand, I may be able to prove that they do. I prefer to hold my cards in this game. (c) Your debunking techniques are the old familiar ones of Blue Book, Condon, and Mass. They don't wash. (d) You treat ufology as a social phenomenon exclusively, whereas its proper thrust is the study of UFOs themselves. (e) The arguments ad hominem are inexcusable. (Perhaps you are merely trying to antagonize people to gain notice.) (f) The single reference to my work concerning Adamski and im- plying that I think there are cities on the back side of the moon is ridicu- lous. It suggests that the scientific theory of the book and the technical details passed over your head. (g) You give great lip service to the scientific method, but fail to apply it. (h) In a number of instances I found the logic to be faulty. Actually, Bob, the book is so bad that I find it easier to believe in flying saucers than that you are serious.

It appeared that the silklike particles 3 were being shot from saucer-shaped 3 crafts in front of the sun. said William F 3 Hummer who lives at 222 Honeymoon St. He said he and about six of his neighbors witnesssed the objects. Two neighbors said they agreed with Hummer's ac- count, but they wouldn't give their names. Hummer said the saucer-type crafts seemed to have round domes on top. He said it looked like the saucers were ex- ploding or \"hatching\" in front of the sun and releasing the smaller particles. The particles seemed to disintegrate as they fell to the ground, he said. AF Model, Continued one estimated the thickness ratio. The descriptions and drawing are therefore in reasonably close agree- ment. The Air Force, in its inimitable fashion, listed this case twice, once explaining it as \"kites\" and once as \"aircraft.\" Case XI. Mar. 20,1950; Stuttgart, Ark. Witnesses were Chicago & Southern Airlines Capt. Jack Adams and First Officer G.W. Ander- son. They described the object as disc-like, but the drawing in Report 14 is of a flat cylinder with sharp edges, like a hockey puck. The des- cription says there was a ring of lights 3/4 of the distance from the center to the edge, but the drawing shows them 9/10 of the way to the edge. The official conclusion: Unidentified. Case XII. Aug. 25/1952; Pittsburg, Kans. The Witness was radio station employee William Squyres. His writ- ten description gives a thickness ratio of 5:1, the drawing dimensions work out to 3 to 3.8:1, and the drawing shows 2.8:1. Squyres described a pair of oval meat platters placed together, but the drawing is of an elongated football with pointed ends. Squyres described several windows* extend- ing from the top to the rear edge; the drawing shows several parallel lines from the center line to the top of the object, but with no color different- iation to suggest windows. Squyres described a series of 6\"-12\" whirling propellers along the outer edge, while the drawing shows them only as small circles. The written descrip- tion plays down Squyres' references to apparently intelligent motion in some windows, though the official conclusion was: Unidentified. With such sloppy work going into the study, is it any wonder that no model of a UFO could be found? - 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"From the Humanold Study Group Archlvos-IV UFO AND OCCUPANT AT SANTA MARIA AIRPORT, AZORES By Ted Bloecher Date of Sighting: Tuesday, Septem- • her 21, 1954. Local Time: 10:45 p.m. (2245 mili- tary time). Locale: Santa Maria Airport, Azores (Portuguese Territory). Primary Witness: Vitorino Lourenco Monteiro, civilian guard at Santa Maria Airport. Duration: From two to three minutes. Closest Proximity: Face-to-face, within arm's length. Investigator: Lt. Henrique da Costa Pessca, Commander of the Portu- guese International Airport of Santa Maria. Hum Cat Classification: Serial #0252, Type B (entity observed getting in and/or out of UFO). Background Among the humanoid cases from the U.S. Air Force UFO files that Richard Hall and I examined at the Air Force Office of History, in Wash- ington, D.C., during the Fall of 1974, was a CEIII case from the Azores. The incident took place on Septem- ber 21, 1954, during the wave of UFO reports that was centered in, but by no means limited to, France. The Air Force concluded that this UFO event was \"Unidentified,\" al- though it was not a U.S. Air Force representative who conducted the investigation. So far as can be determined, there is only one published source for the Azores case: a brief abstract can be found in the Appendix of Jacques Vallee's book, Passport To Magonia (Regnery, 1969, p. 210), where it is misdated as September 20, 1954. Vallee has identified the witness as Vitorino Lourenco Mon- teiro (his name is not included in the Air Force report). The official ver- sion of the case is published here for the first time. i 8 Since the event occurred on Por- tuguese territory, the official inquiry was conducted by a representative of the Portuguese government, Lt. Henrique da Costa Pessca, Com- mander of the Santa Maria Airport facility. The information contained in Lt. Pessca's report was made avail- able to Wing Intelligence Officer Robert D. Gammell, 1st Lieutenant, U.S.A.F., head of the U.S. Intelli- gence Operations at the Azores Air Transport Station in Lajes Field. Lt. Gammell prepared and submitted his report to Air Force Intelligence in accordance with the official UFO reporting format, APR 200-2, the procedure used from 1953 through 1966, when it was revised for use in conjunction with the Condon Com- mittee inquiry.

There was a plexiglass-type section in the forward end, also blue, which con- tained the \"pilot.\" There were four pole-like appendages, two at each end, which supported parallel aerials, and there was an orange light in the nose of the object.

The witness was un- able to see any landing gear. A blond-haired man, 5 feet, 10 inches in height, got out of a door located in the plexiglass section; he approach- ed the witness, but \"attempts to con- verse failed.\" The encounter lasted from 2 to 3 minutes and was termi- nated by the approach of an auto- mobile. After the pilot reboarded and \"belted up,\" the UFO ascended almost vertically and then accele- rated rapidly into the night sky, dis- appearing in the darkness. The weather, according to the witness, was fair, with visibility un- limited. The official weather condi- tions for Terceira Island (142 nautical miles to the northwest of Santa Maria Island) reported the ceiling at 200 feet, with a one/eighth cloud cover at that altitude. The wind direction was 230 degrees at 14 knots, at 6,000 feet. There were no balloon launch- ings in that area at the time. Comments by 1st Lieutenant Gammell The above information was re- lated by Lt. Henrique da Costa Pes- sca, Commander of the Portuguese International Civil Airport at Santa Maria, Azores, during a personal interview with the reporting officer. According to the story reported by Lt. Pessca, the guard saw the strange object land. A blond-haired man, approximately 5' 10\" in height, got out, walked over to him and spoke in a strange language which the guard did not understand. The guard attempted to converse in French, without success. After a min- ute or so of this, the headlights of a car were seen approaching the guard post, which is in the middle of an intersection with roads leading to the only port on the island, the town of Villa do Porto and the airport. The strange man patted the guard on the back of his shoulder in a friendly fashion and got back into his \"flying cigar\" (the term used by Pessca), fastened a safety belt across his middle and some shoulder straps, then seemingly pushed a button. The craft took off with its nose raised a few degrees from the horizontal, traveled a few feet, then levelled off and shot almost straight up. The occupants of the car, whose headlights caused the departure of the strange man, stopped to ask the guard what the strange light was they had seen above his post. The guard related a part of his story to the people in the car. Later, the guard decided he would not report the incident to his superiors for fear of not being believed. However, the persons in the car began spreading the story around the small island of Santa Maria. In view of the stories being circulated, the guard made an offi- cial report of the incident late on the following day. The guard stated he was too scared while the strange man was present to think about arresting him. Lt. Pessca stated (that) he had interrogated the guard three days in a row and received the same story on each occasion. Pessca had a folder full of state- ments and drawings of this incident, which he kept in his safe. He dis- played a rough drawing of the object taken from this file, to the reporting officer. In this drawing, the pilot of the object was seated approximately in the middle of his craft at a slight backward slant from the vertical. The shape of the object was similar to that of a pecan nut or a football except it did not have as pronounced a point at the front and rear. The guard is 25-28 years old and originally from a town near Lisbon. He is reported by the Santa Maria Airport Director to be a good worker with no police record, a steady, reli- able man and not a nervous type. Pessca further stated there was no evidence to indicate the Guard would invent the story for personal publicity. When asked for his personal views on the sighting, Lt. Pessca stated: \"I personally don't believe.\" Then he indicated he had nothing to support this belief except that the guard remembered too many details for a two or three minute period of time. Then he shrugged and said, \"I don't know; maybe it is true. It is very strange indeed.\" A Mr. Correira, a Portuguese national working for Pan American Airways at Santa Maria, told a repre- sentative of the AATS Intelligence Office he had been on the opposite side of.the island at approximately 2230Z the same evening and had seen some strange white lights above the island. Some fishermen coming into the island at approximately the same time also are reported to have seen some strange lights above the field. Mr. Owen Gowman, FAA Direc- tor at Santa Maria Airport, told the reporting officer several of his Ameri- can employees saw strange lights above the airfield during the latter part of September. Additional infor- mation as to time, color, number, dates, etc., has been requested and will be forwarded separately when received. Since the sighting of the \"flying cigar\" was made at a Portuguese civil airport by a Portuguese guard, the reporting officer did not have the opportunity to personally inter- rogate the principal. However, it is my opinion that Lt. Pessca coop- erated to the fullest extent in relating the facts of the case as he knew them. This is not another incident of some- k one thinking he saw something: the guard either saw the object as re-, ported, or he saw nothing and con- cocted the entire story for reasons of his own. In the absence of informa- tion to indicate the latter, the former . seems to be the answer to the facts so far presented. The following article appeared in a local newspaper on this island (Terceira) on October 3,1954, and is reported as additional information on unusual sightings in the Santa Maria area. Santa Maria, Sept. 28: A PAA DC-6B com- manded by Captain Freeman, radioed shortly after leaving Santa Maria Airport that at • approximately 3:20 a.m. (9/28), while flying at 6400 meters altitude with the weather exceptionally clear (no clouds) at 38° 36' W longitude, he sighted above the ocean a large (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"FOGARTY ON KLASS: A COMMENT By Jennie Zeldman (® 1981 by Jennie Zeidman) It is invigorating and satisfying to debate one's peers, to engage in intellectual battle over a problem mutually defined. Sometimes whole new avenues are opened, and solu- tions are shown where before, blind spots clouded the issue. Arguments among ufologists are common—but they are arguments within the bounds of decorum—of respect for the intellect and integrity of one another, of recognition of the re- search and documentation provided by one another, and most important- ly, they are arguments within the rules of logic and rationality. It has become abundantly clear, in written and verbal exchange, that Philip Klass is unwilling (or perhaps unable) to abide by those standards normally considered proper for de- bate. He speaks his own private tongue, while serious ufologists speak the language of logical, ra- tional inquiry. I have yet to see any positive results from these exchanges — although one might note that they have provided \"comic relief\" or amusement from time to time. As Quentin Fogarty has indicated - (No. 157, March 1981) Mass and his ilk feed upon the publicity we, the serious ufologists, provide for them (they do little investigating of their own, but swoop, like vultures, upon cases we have already brought down). The tape transcript cited by Quentin displays what we all know so well: rational, productive dis- course with Klass is impossible. Enough of this waste of time, of giving audience to childish tantrums, attempted diversions, and unscrup- ulous ploys, which have contributed nothing to ufological knowledge. During the 2Vz years I worked on the Coyne helicopter case,* I don't recall ever responding directly to Mass's voluminous attempts at cor- respondence. I would no more attempt disclosure with him than with a tantrum-throwing, hysterical 6-year-old. As with a 6-year-old, I walk away. When negative behavior is not reinforced with recognition, sooner or later it ceases. We all know everything we need to know about Mr. Klass. Now, let's move on to something worthwhile. *\"A Helicopter-UFO Encounter Over Ohio,\" by Jennie Zeidman, Center for UFO Studies, P.O.

Azores, Continued lighted area of abnormal brilliance, a fact for which no explanation was available. At any rate, it didn't seem possible that it could have been a ship. It gave off a greater amount of light than any illuminated ship could possibly have given. The phenomenon was also observed by pas- sengers aboard; who unanimously affirmed that it was a flying saucer (or should be termed a flying saucer). The plane didn't attempt to come any closer to the strange object which, as the plane continued onward, still remained above the water. Diario Insular, 3 Oct. 1954. Mr. Cowman, the FAA Director, personally talked to Captain Free- man on his return trip from Lisbon to the States and, when shown the above article, the Captain stated it was essentially correct except that 10 the altitude of the aircraft was 15,000 feet. Mr. Gowman stated Captain Freeman was positive the 40 to 50 very bright lights he sighted above the water were not ships at sea. He stated that he has flown across the Atlantic many times and has seen hundreds of lighted ships, but these lights were much brighter than any he has ever seen. Comments It is probably unnecessary to add any comments to the above, but I find myself unable to resist men- tioning one aspect of this remark- able report, a feature guaranteed to stick in the craw of most serious UFO researchers—that is the pre- sence of an entirely human UFO L naut. \"Extraterrestrials,\" as all rea- sonable \"ufologists\" know, are not supposed to be human. Unfortun- ately, the guard at Santa Maria Airport didn't know what everyone else knew in 1954. But that airport guard wasn't the only one not paying attention in 1954: on the afternoon of August 20, just one month before the event in the Azores, a similar incident occurred in the Oeydalen Valley of Norway.

Brand, Coordinator of MUFON-Central European Section (MUFON-CES). MUFON-CES con- sists of our German-speaking col- leagues in Austria and Switzerland as well as West Germany. (Membership is by invitation only.) Since the early 1970s a small though dedicated and highly research-oriented group of professional scientists has been working through MUFON-CES to- wards a better understanding and eventual resolution of the UFO phenomenon (perhaps we should say phenomena). This article provides some details of the large volume of German-lan- guage material, published by MUFON-CES, on their investi- gations of UFO reports and consequent research endeavours. MUFON-CES has held an annual congress from 1974 to 1980, inclusive, and the proceedings have been pub- lished in German for the first five of these gatherings. Each year the vol- umes have become successively larger—no doubt due to the success and untiring efforts of Mr. Brand and his associates. The proceedings of their 1979 and 1980 congresses are being prepared for publication. (Mr. Schneider's paper about instru- mental UFO research, presented at the 1979. MUFON-CES conference, is long enough—about 200 pages— for a separate publication.) Unfortunately, English sum- maries or abstracts of the presented papers are contained only in the publication of their 1975 congress, held in Icking, West Germany. To acquaint Journal readers with the nature of the research results and research proposals published by MUFON-CES, this article reviews the 240-page publication of their 1975 congress. The quotations which appear below are from the summary abstracts, in English, of the published papers. Electromagnetic and Gravitational Effects of UFOs In a 70-page article Dipl.-Ing. A. Schneider, another distinguished European UFOlogist, and MUFON's representative in West Germany, presents a detailed non-technical discussion of \"Electromagnetic and Gravitational Effects of Unidentified Flying Objects.\" This paper is con- cerned \"with a few UFO effects that have been observed over and over again,\" including effects which \"have been automatically recorded by instruments.\" \"With the help of selected characteristic examples that often come from numerous inde- pendent witnesses, the author attempts to prove that the electro- magnetic and gravitative interactions must be essentially correlated with the propulsion system of the uniden- tified flying object.\" Mr. Schneider discusses various \"physical second- ary effects\" reported in association with UFOs, also \"primary effects, which are presumably of a gravitative nature,... presented by means of exemplary cases\" (e.g., reports of UFOs which \"hover or accelerate directly over the ground or over water\" causing \"crater or cone-like movement... that cannot be ex- plained by aerodynamic air movement alone.\" He also relates cases of close encounter witnesses who \"sometimes speak of a strange force that hinders their freedom of movement,\" e.g., as in the famous October 1973 case in Pascagoula, Miss., when \"the grav- itative force seemed to have affected the kidnappers as well as their victims.\" The paper's appendix in- cludes \"approximately 350 coded cases\" and a bibliography of about 100 sources. New Theories of Gravity and UFOs The paper \"New Theories of Gravitation and the Qualitative Explanation for Some Physical Effects of UFO's,\" by Dipl. Phys. I. Brand, is the longest (62 pp.) in the publication of the 1975 MUFON- CES congress. This often highly technical and mathematical article, \"directed mainly to theoretical physicists,\" is based on new theories of gravity and \"the attempt is made to support the extraterrestrial hypothesis as the explanation of UFO phenomena. For this purpose, gravitation theories are introduced which predict accompanying electro- magnetic effects that have been observed in the vicinity of UFO's.\" • Mr. Brand discusses \"the de- velopment and the most important characteristics of the theories,... in abbreviated form.\" This provides an \"overview of the main directions of gravitational research\" as a back- ground to enable readers to \"judge the theoretical path and the import- ance of the... unified quantum theory of matter and gravitation by Burkhard Heim.\" (This theory is discussed in the July 1979 issue of the Journal.—Editor.) The detailed abstract concludes with this statement: \"Finally, it will be shown how, according to Heim's theory, it is possible, in principle, for a space ship traveling at less than the speed of light, to reach the mantel of the light cone. The result provides the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH) and a theoretical basis.\" Thirty-six illustrations and photo- graphs (including several well- known to English-speaking UFO (Continued on next page) 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"German, Continued researchers), 22 bibliographical references, and 117 non-UFO- related citations accompany this article. Use of Mathematical Models in UFO Research \"Mathematical Procedure for Analyzing Theoretically Unpredict- able Phenomena\" is the title of a brief article by Dr. Leo Ferrera. Through historical examples he analyzes the problem of \"typical reactions of men to spontaneous phenomena... On the one hand one finds a tendency toward mysticism while on the other hand the factual nature of the phenomena is denied. Because of this, the reception the data receive is scarcely influenced by the objective quality of data and evidence.\" Thus, an essential question to ask is to \"what extent mathematical methods of evaluation can be helpful for an objective judgment.\" Acknowledging that \"from the mathematical viewpoint, spon- taneous phenomena present a series of peculiarities that can make use of these procedures difficult,\" the author proposes \"a practical strategy... to start from a special classification of spontaneous phen- omena. .. based on the presence or absence of an intelligent originator of the phenomena and on the exist- ence and nature of an underlying intention to communicate.\" Dr. Ferrera then outlines \"the appli- cation of probabilities for composite events and cluster analysis/' and briefly sketches two other methods—\"game theory and the theory of fuzzy sets.\" He reviews \"the smoothing and compensation of the observational errors that can be expected from mathematical methods as well as the nature of the interrelations between observation and theory develop- ment.\" The author concludes that mathematical models, assuming that \"the correct choice and application have been made, can not only serve to derive inferences from the mat- erial on hand,\" but also can \"indicate 12 strategies for further research.\" Also, he says, \"the introduction of math- ematical methods for the analysis of spontaneous phenomena is useful, even in a relatively early phase of the research.\" (p.68) This short and comparitively non-technical article should be a prime candidate for translation into English. Other Papers A few other short papers are contained in the 1975 conference proceedings. \"Misinterpretations and Forgeries\" by Ostudrat.a.D. H. Malthaner, > discusses photographs which, \"because of misinterpretation, have been related to UFOs.\" He also analyzes twelve such \"clever forgeries\" which \"show methods of intentional deception that were adopted into the UFO literature as genuine.\" The article concludes with \"criteria... that allow one to test the authenticity of UFO photos.\" (p.33) Luis Schonherr's article analyzes \"the particular phases in the devel- opment of scientific research\" and discusses \"the particularities of UFO data... (for example the problems of sources, reliability, strangeness).\" He also reviews the difficulty in obtaining UFO report information because of \"the complexity of the phenomenon and... the pollution of the information channels.\" He proposes \"a structure of a docu- mentary system\" and data procedures, and briefly sketches \"the problems of automatic -classi- fication\" of UFO data.(p.54) Translation Services Needed! The above information should illustrate the wealth of published German-language UFO material available to the international UFO community. MUFON has a copy of each of the five published pro- ceedings of the MUFON-CES con- gresses. Moreover, we have permis- sion from MUFON-CES to get this voluminous material translated and published (with, of course, an ap- propriate reference to individual copyrights, and acknowledgement —and thariks—to 'MUFON-CES). Therefore, MUFON would like to secure the voluntary translation services of people prepared to tran- slate some of this material from German into English. As we fully \" recognize that language translation is a very difficult and time-consum- ing task, we hope to interest differ- ent people to translate relatively small pieces (i.e., specific articles). Thus, we are not asking anyone to translate a large amount of material. Hopefully, some offers of translation will be forthcoming. We are asking MUFON-CES to recommend which papers they think would be most useful to have tran- slated first. Consideration should be given to articles they might be es- pecially keen to see disseminated to UFO researchers. A priority listing might also suggest early translation of articles about the results of their UFO case investigation. Another approach is that publication of English abstracts of all articles in the published MUFON-CES proceedings would enable potential translators to offer to translate an article of par- ticular interest to them. Can you help in this important task in UFO research? If so, please contact MUFON (108 Oldtowne Road, Seguin, Texas 78155, U.S-A.) Even an offer to translate only one small article would be of enormous benefit. Let us break down the barriers of language which prevent dissemina- tion of scientific UFO research. As UFO reports are essentially the same throughout the world, we are all working towards a resolution of the same puzzling enigma which has baffled mankind in all corners of our planet. VOLUNTEERS NEEDED MUFON has a constant need for foreign language translators, as well as specialists in other fields (science, technology, field investigation, docu- mentation . . .). Members are in- vited to write to Walter H. Andrus, Jr., International Director, 103 Old- towne Rd., Seguin, TX 78155.

Scott Rogo, and in particular the two concluding chap- ters in which the joint authors ex- press differing, but compatible, views about the nature of UFOs. In my opinion, truth is truth. It does not change, but man sees more as he develops. \"Absolute Truth\" will always be \"Absolute Truth.\" If the entire UFO history has shown changes in the patterns of man-UFO interactions, then changes in that pattern (steps : or jumps to keep just ahead of man) 1 is certainly the result of higher direction, even higher than the entities in direct control of the UFOs. The essential nature of the mystery certainly hasn't changed in any way whatsoever. If we had \"absolute proof of the history of the UFOs to 30,000 B.C., as the cave drawings of UFO shapes in southwestern France and Canta- brian Spain indicate, 2 then we could start saying some of our hypotheses are now laws. For an example: if we could photograph all of the UFO- connoted images in these caves, then we could index and digitally analyze by computer for shape, fre- quency, etc. Even those images con- sidered psychosexual should be cata- logued secondarily for an ability to add and subtract the numerical weight to a finding. Monotheism was born long be- fore 6,000 B.C. as an oral history, be- fore man could put his symbols into writing. The first written \"biblical\" books came from the Aramaic cul- ture, into which Jesus Christ was born. We also have hints that the Aramaic culture came from an earlier one that lasted about 15,000 years. The sum total of these two cultures encompasses about 30,000 years, which is the same as the cave draw- ing records. The early oral history was shroud- ed in apochryphal mystery by dedi- cated cults who, it is supposed, named their groups after the phenomena (non) which transmitted the knowledge to man. One such cult's name trans- lated as \"we who descend to the chariots.\" This title was used long before we had chariots in our civiliza- tions. The altered state of reality hypo- thesis, discussed in The Tujunga Can- yon Contacts, is valid to a degree. That is, perhaps a lone individual has the elusive psychic ability that draws out the UFO phenomenon from its own \"Space-time-continuum,\" but others in the vicinity can also clearly see the UFO. That does not mean \"innocent bystanders\" are in an altered state of consciousness/reality to the degree the original operant is. For example, about 3 years ago a very large UFO buzzed a town near Bakersfield, California. It was seen by 'dozens, perhaps hundreds, of people. All of them could not have been' in an altered state.\" ' \" I believe the \"hard\" and \"soft\" evidence' found in UFO research isn't really contradictory. This UFO reality game may, to humanity, seem a game, but something surfaces that smacks of planned alteration. I be- lieve we need not think about how bizarre or how simple the manifesta- tions have been, because that would/ could sidetrack us from the underly- ing principle and drown us in detail. Regarding the \"aspect\" history, as outlined in Druffel's concluding chapter, the physical, psychological, and psychic aspects in the history of the modern UFO wave seem valid. However, Step 4 — the philosophi- cal aspect — began around 1965 or so, in my opinion, and Step 5 — the cosmological aspect — seems to have already begun. Our physicists/ scientists are treading heavily, deeper and deeper, into the truth. The work we see beginning at CERN, our own \"transistor valley,\" and other places demonstrate this. I see a pattern of recent scientific research which con- firms the existence of God. The \"detail reflectivity\" discussed in the same chapter seems to hit some hardcore truth. It might be, however, that this hypothesis is arbi- trary. I don't know, of course, and don't intend to be ambiguous on the subject or to invalidate Druffel's ideas about \"d-r\" (detailed reflectivity). 3 But perhaps \"d-r\" occurs as a by- product of interaction and communi- cation between UFOs and humans, rather than being an essential ele- (Continued on next page) 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Contacts, Continued ment in close encounters and abduc- tions. I feel that Druffel's conclusions regarding the nature of UFOs and their motives for being interested in the human race are proper and merit careful thought and study. I don't think they are presumptuous in any direct way; indeed, they may be soft and innocent in comparison to the hard and cold realities they confront. To the book's joint authors' credit, there is a generous overlap of two points of view. Druffel's viewpoint may be a philosophical one, while D. Scott Rogo's view is statistically de- rived. Both conclusions express be- liefs personal to their private per- sonalities, and as such, the subject (UFOs) itself is seen through their own \"d-r\" senses. The two authors seem to have a distinctive taste of the Absolute Truth. Regarding Rogo's conclusions, whose hypothesis regarding UFOs is that they are the result of an intelligent, but essentially unknown Phenomenon which responds to human psychological needs, I'm not arguing against his conclusion per se, but the Phenomenon does not always mold itself exactly to the vic- tim's predispositions. Referring back to the matter of detail reflect- ivity, which Rogo addresses by another literary term, we can see certain aspects of the Betty Andreas- son case which is rich in this. Mrs. Andreasson tells us that she had a childhood rich in Christian Church ceremony. There is much \"d-r\" especially regarding her religious faith. The entities have their own \"glowing paged\" book, and she meets on her journey an intelligence of such magnitude that she asks if it is Jesus, or God. After Betty's abduc- tion was recalled under hypnotic re- gression, she divorced her husband. Could it be that she was under psychological stress prior to the divorce? Was this solution the best way a Phenomenon could have re- sponded to her needs? A close correlation between the Tujunga Shaw-Whitley case and other classic cases concerns certain 14 furniture, mainly chairs, seen in UFOs. Betty Andreasson was specifi- cally clear about glass chairs and glass covers, and the hoses attached to the chairs/boxes when the top and bottom was united in one assem- bly. Far away in Brazil, Antonio Villa-Boas reported the same thing. His description of identical glass chairs was withheld from the public, according to Raymond Fowler. Betty Andreasson's and AVB's abductions occurred in the same decade, al- though Andreasson did not report her experience until long after the AVB Brazilian case came to light. On page 251 of The Tujunga Can- yon Contacts, Sara Shaw's drawing of the \"conference room\" evokes a curi- ous image echo of Andreasson's drawing of tubes leading down to the glass chairs. Here we have what might be called a rhythm of vision. Were the Shaw-Whitley case and the Andreasson/Boas cases con- ducted by the same intelligence? These similar details neither in- validate Rogo's hypothetical crux or support it to the degree they should. The diversity and complexity of all UFO incidents cannot, in my opinion, be encompassed by a singular hy- pothesis. If there is a real symbiotic link between man and higher UFO intel- ligences, you could paraphrase Bib- lical writ in the Old Testament, wherein God told the Israelites they were an errant race and if undis- posed to heed his threats, they would get a lesson. And, they did receive a lesson. Now, if you jump ahead thousands of years to the present, it is obvious man as a race has gone haywire. There is a pattern in Holy Writ — a pattern which hints that \"the super- mind\" (entities/phenomenon/spirits/ God) is having to employ some bizarre phenomena to illustrate something to a bizarre race of beings. I personally do not think the bizarre nature of some UFO phenomena is haphazard. Considering the detail reflectivity fact in many close en- counters/abductions, would not this account for the sometimes awful ex- periences of the UFO victims? This is the sinister aspect. There exists the benevolent aspect also, but both aspects imply objectified, albeit tem- porarily, UFOs and beings. If some of our contemporary ufologists have truly given up the idea that UFOs are nuts and bolts craft, they could be simplistically viewing very complex craft, for a complex subject such as UFOs would have complex \"machinery\" to carry out their mission, whatever it is. I consider myself a \"nuts and bolts man,\" but only to the extent that the craft are \"physical\" while choosing to manifest and to operate in our environment and before human wit- nesses. We cannot ignore the ex- treme velocities, maneuvers, and the implications of strong and unique applications of EM forces. Despite the fact that many UFO researchers suspect that the UFOs are very real, but only temporarily physical, the ships are very advanced, and as far as we can tell are piloted by very ad- vanced intelligence (s). We have all heard reports of \"mother ships\" and we know that some entities have reportedly talked about enormous carrier craft in orbit above Earth and also stationed mil- lions of miles away. It logically would be more \"cost-effective\" to take one large ship containing several smaller recon/surveillance vehicles. We know that time dilations occur at the speed of light. I mention this because an implication of time dilation is illustrated by UFO his- tory. The last 100 years of UFO history — roughly from 1896 to 1981 — could be just seconds or minutes or days to any intelligence operant at extremely high velocities. In the Hill incident, the beings didn't understand aging. And considering the time span between the Andreas- son Affair, the Tujunga Contacts, and the Brazilian AVB incident, the very obvious geographical distances between all three reports, and men- tioning again the similarity of certain furniture aboard all three craft con- cerned in these three cases, we can suspect that time dilation may be (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Contacts, Continued part of the existence of UFO entities. The \"reinforcement schedule\" by which UFOs seem to be helping mankind think in new and original terms should wash well with our philosophers, psychologists, and perhaps our theologians also. How else could man develop or even hope to survive unless his concepts are updated and rearranged? The last poll on UFO belief places a \"belief threshold\" at about 68-75%. I suspect the remaining 32% have a hidden body of about 15% more believers who are too timid to admit their beliefs to themselves, much less to the poll taker! Perhaps we can guesstimate the UFO mechanism has generated 84% acceptance. If this is so, then we could logically expect such a dynamic to swing/ spin or polarize to a larger mass, for example, 99.99 percent! With this in mind, it isn't illogical to expect a new wave of UFO pheno- mena in the near future. The next wave should be more intense and contain different manifestations. What we should see is that the symbol has undergone social dif- fusion. I think the phenomenon and its social diffusion has reached criti- cality. I agree the \"Phenomenon\" is abusively, and socially, chaotic as well as being psychologically damag- ing to most individuals at various degrees. Mr. Rogo's amalgamation of several theories has a real \"bite\" to it, especially when he mentions that the manifestations have obviously physical qualities. Rogo (and Clark, et al) say. In a nutshell then, we do not think that the UFO mystery is directly produced by our own minds. It is physically, though only tempo- rarily, created by \"The Phenome- non\" in answer to our needs. Then Rogo takes the germinal theory a step further. A nexus per- mits the UFO drama to unfold. UFO abductions/dramas occur when the witness is in a state of psychological need. Once contacted by a human mind in such a state, the supermind creates an experience for the witness, by drawing upon information and preoccupations buried deep within the human mind. Rogo is to be congratulated for bringing this modality/operant mechanism to the attention of the public in that format and regarding the subject of UFOs in particular. I think UFO-CE-Abduction stat- istics tell us that man has an innate ability to think about solutions to his problems — an innate connection via his subconsciousness to tap a supermind that is, while part of him, also external to himself. We should be beginning to comprehend his truly innate ability to tap an incred- ible and nearly incomprehensible source that will help him mature — but seemingly only step by careful step. That the subconscious can leach out to the conscious mind just what if wants known, and that the subcon- sciousness is also linked to an in- finite mind, supermind, or to an \"energy dynamic,\" should be in- creasingly clear. Man has a beautiful instrument — the human brain — that has the capacity for infinite knowledge. I believe mankind approaches a definite change toward a spiritual plane, via an appreciation of his innate spirituality. Overviewing our new physics demonstrates the ex- treme likelihood of subatomics exist- ing and acting at velocities far ex- ceeding the speed of light. I realize my belief is not neces- sarily comprehensible to others who have their own subjective reality structures. I do feel, however, that objective and subjective reality is intermeshed with quantum/quantaic phenomena, and the complexity of \"the phenomenon.\" I haven't reached an affirmed, unshakeable conclu- sion, but I am fearful that whatever we are dealing with appears to desire residency among us. Its hesitancy is caused by what we have done in the past, or what we are doing presently, or will do in the future. Whether or not I am mistaken isn't of conse- quence in the long run. Norms are to be respected and sought after in all phases of life, but I've the cynicism to say — \"nothing happens by accident.\" San Pranolsoo Examiner April 18. 1952 Five Feport Flying Discs Near Nevada Test Region LAS VEGAS (Nev.), April 17. —(INS)—Flying saucers In th« area of the Nevada test site, where Important new atomic tests are In progress, were re- ported today.  i An Air Force technical sergeant and four civilian workers at the Ncllls Air Force Base, near Las Vegas, said they saw eighteen circular objects Hying an easterly course which carried them over or very close to the test site. JIEPOBTED BT FIVE. Tose who reported seeing the objects were T/SgX Orvllle Lew- son, Rudy Toncer, Sheet metal shop foreman, and sheet metal shop workers R, K. Van Houtln, Edward Gregory and, Chrales Ruliffson. The objects went by at 12:05 p. m. Van Houtln saw them first and caled the attention of the others to them. STBEAK EAST. The men watched the saucers for about 30 seconds while they streaked across the sky in an easterly course north of Ia> Vegas and disappeared. The men estimated that the craft were 40,00 let up and fly- ing at a. speed of at least 1,200 miles an hour. The objects flew an Irregular formation with one of. them off to the right, moving with a zig-zag motion. They left no smoke or vapor.

Police of- ficers and others watched the ob- jects for up to 5 hours on December 28. UFO REPORT has switched back to a quarterly schedule, beginning with their third issue of 1981. They will continue publishing an Annual, as well. The new address for the magazine is: Sterling Publications, 355 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10017. Paul Dong's \"UFO Update\" col- umn in the May issue of OMNI is a very interesting summary of UFO activity in China, as well as a report on the UFO research which is now being conducted in that country. Soviet UFO researcher, Valerii I. Sanarov, has ah article on UFOs and folklore in the April issue of CUR- RENT ANTHROPOLOGY. Unfortu- nately, Sanarov concludes his article by saying that \"flying saucers and little green men do not exist in objective reality.\" This is the type of nonsense which is found so often in the UFO literature (or what passes for same) today. THE JOURNAL OF UFO STUD- IES, Vol. II, is now available from the Center for UFO Studies for $7.50 per copy. This issue contains articles by Richard Hall, Thomas M. Olsen, Durk Pearson, Roberto Enrique Banchs, and Richard W. Heiden and several other researchers. To my way of thinking, Durk Pearson's arti- cle on instrumentation for analysis of physical traces left by UFOs is the most interesting of the lot. Some others would be\" helpful for insom- niacs. The bi-annual issues of the JOURNAL are, in my opinion, great- ly overpriced. It has also been a mystery to me why CUFOS does not combine its four periodicals (includ- ing the \"International UFO Reporter\" section of FRONTIERS OF SCIENCE) into one monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly publication. The most ele- mentary logic should suggest that one deadline is easier to meet than four, especially considering that the publications are all dealing with vari- ious aspects of the same overall topic. A new periodical from UFO re- searcher Tom Benson is THE SIXTH QUARK JOURNAL, to be published \"as many times a year as possible.\" The subscription rate for four issues is $10.00 (U.S. and Canada). Single issues may be purchased at $2.50 each. The first issue contains articles by Benson, Kenneth W. Behrendt (on UFO propulsion) and O. Ray, plus news notes, book reviews, etc. More attention to proofreading is needed, as this issue contains a large number of typographical errors. However, the magazine might well develop into a useful periodical in future issues. Subscriptions and orders for individual issues should be sent to the magazine at: P.O. Box 1174, Trenton, NJ 08606. (Director's Message, Continued) servations. It is in this manner that we are able to obtain the raw facts needed that will not only distinguish an IFO from UFO, but hopefully the clues that will aid us in resolving this enigma. James McCampbell, MUFON Director for Research, was asked by Robert Sheaff er, during a recent visit in Jim's home, to evaluate Bob's new book and express an opinion. Jim will share a copy of his letter to Robert Sheaffer for the readers of the Journal. \"Leading Skeptic Inves- tigates the Case for UFOs\" is the headline for the news release and the book is described as \"an incisive UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE The UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE will keep you informed of all the latest United States and World-Wide UFO activity, as it happens! Our service was started in 1969, at which time we contracted with a reputable international newspaper-clipping bureau to obtain for us, those hard to find UFO reports (i.e., little known photographic cases, close encounter and landing reports, occupant cases) and all other UFO reports, many of which are carried only in small town or foreign newspapers. \"Our UFO Newsclipping Service issues are 20-page monthly reports, reproduced by photo-offset, containing the latest United States and Canadian UFO newsclippings, with our foreign section carrying the latest British, Australian, New Zealand and other foreign press reports. Also included is a 3-5 page section of \"Fortean\" clippings (i.e. Bigfoot and other \"monster\" reports). Let us keep you informed of the latest happenings in the UFO and Fortean fields.\" For subscription information and sample pages from our service, write today to: UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE Route 1 — Box 220 Plumerville, Arkansas 72127 analysis of the factual case for UFOs.\" Basically, the book is an insult to the intelligence of any knowledgeable reader who can readily recognize the proverbial \"snowjob\" that Mr. Scheaffer has unleashed in the typical Philip Klass style. 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE by Walt Andrws William L. Moore, coauthor of the two recent books The Philadelphia Experiment and The Roswell Incident' will share the podium .with Stanton T. Friedman at the 1981 MUFON UFO Symposium on July 24, 25, and 26 at M.I.T. in Cam- bridge, Mass. (Boston). Bill is our State Section Director in Prescott, Ariz., for Yavapai County. Lt. Col: Lawrence Coyne has rescinded his committment to speak. This vacancy ' has been filled by the Program Committee by moving Mrs. Cynthia R. Hind, writer/lecturer and MU- FON Representative for Zimbabwe (Rhodesia) in Africa from the Work- shop Sessions. Mrs. Hind was a workshop speaker at the 1978 MU- FON symposium in Dayton, Ohio. ' John F. Schuessler, MUFON Deputy Director for Administration and President of VISIT, will be speaking at the CUFOS UFO Con- ference on September 25,26, and 27 in a Chicago area hotel. John will - relate the investigation into the serious medical effects incurred in the Cash/Landrum close encounter case of December 29, 1980, on the highway between New Caney and Dayton; Texas. His appearance at the CUFQS Conference is a recip- rocating arrangement between MU- FON and CUFOS, since Dr. J. Allen Hynek will be the keynote speaker at M.I.T. on July 25 at the MU- FON UFO Symposium. The 1981 MUFON UFO Sym- posium Proceedings will be avail- able on July 24 in Boston for those attending our 12th annual sympo- sium and immediately thereafter by mail for ten dollars (U.S. Funds) postpaid from MUFON, 103 Old- towne Road, Seguin, Texas 78155, U.S.A. The APRO sponsored \"UFOHIO '81\" on June 5,6, and 7 at the Marriott InnrAirport in Cleve- land, Ohio, will be history by the time most readers receive this issue of the Journal. They did not publish a current list of the speakers in the APRO .Bulletin, therefore we are unable to provide this information. Some very competent and know- ledgeable people in UFOlogy were originally scheduled. Billed as a \"Giant UFO Conven- tion,\" the National UFO Conference will sponsor a June 27 event at the Howard Johnson Motor Lodge, in DePere, Wisconsin. Speakers will include James W. Moseley, co- founder of the National UFO Con- ference, author and researcher; Wil- liam Moore, researcher, lecturer and author; Col. Wendelle C. Stevens (USAF Ret.), noted researcher and author of one of the most contro- versial books of modern times, UFO: Contact from the Pleiades; and Rick Hilberg, author, lecturer, and Chairman of the Ohio UFO Group. Mr. Hilberg publishes the UFO JOURNAL and is co-publisher of the Hilberg-Easley Report. The book of photographs by Wendelle C. Stevens is definitely the most controversial book of modern times. This selection of words does not adequately describe the greatest sham that has been thrust upon the UFO public since the George A- damski photos. The Eduard \"Billy\" Meier photographs are simply sus- pended models placed in front of the camera, both still and motion picture, using various countryside scenes in Switzerland as a back- ground. As a photo researcher, Col. Stevens has destroyed his own personal integrity and credibility by promoting these hoax photos and •book. Your Director can document the veracity of this evaluation, there- fore I challenge the people of Gen- esis III Productions, Ltd. to provide the evidence that these are authentic photographs of UFOs. If this firm should publish Volume II, as they have promised, they are knowingly committing a form of fraud upon the public and making a mockery of scientific UFOlogy. Michael Brein, Ph.D., State Dir- ector for Hawaii, has appointed Paul E. McCarthy, Ph.D. as the Assistant State Director and Research Spe- cialist. Dr. McCarthy resides at 3687 Woodlawn Terrace Place, Honolulu, Hawaii 96822 and may be contacted by telephone at (808) 988-6954.' Paul earned his doctorate in Political Science with a thesis on the late James McDonald. Richard D. Sei- fried, M.A., was selected by Larry Moyers to become the new State Section Director for Montgomery, Preble, and Greene counties in Ohio. Richard may be contacted by writing to 7340 Calmcrest Court, Dayton, OH 45424 or telephoning (513) 233-4055. Robert Grattan III of 107 Howard Street, Ashland VA 23005 has agreed to serve MUFON in a multiple role due to .his many talents. Bob becomes the State Sec- tion Director for Henrico and Han- over counties in Virginia, a French translator, and an active member of our amateur radio net, using the call letters WA4NKZ. It is with regret that we accept the resignation of Dr. Willard P. Armstrong as State Director for Missouri on May 30, 1981, coincid- ing with his retirement from the engineering department of the Noo- ter Corporation in St. Louis. Bill and Carol, founding members of MU- FON and the UFO Study Group of Greater St. Louis, have purchased a retirement home in Tampa, Florida. Bill will continue to be active in the MUFON amateur radio net as WCNC from his new QTH. After becoming settled and acclimated in the Sunshine State, he will resume his activity in a leadership role.
