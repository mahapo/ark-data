INTRODUCTION I f Webster's definition of an unnatural phenomenon is accepted as \"a fact or event of special or unique significance\" that is \"inconsistent with what is natural or expected; going beyond what is normal,\" unidentified flying objects, more popularly known as UFOs, certainly fall within this general definition. Photographs containing images that appear to be UFOs are subject to skepticism because 1) the UFO represents a phenomenon that cannot be fully explained by modern-day science and 2) photographs are known to be easily falsified. The old adage \"the camera never lies\" is no longer accepted as a truism; especially to the UFO skeptic, who is quick to point to any anomaly in a photograph as \"proof of fakery. The true believer on the other hand, is willing to accept the anomaly as an indigenous artifact of the UFO experience by reasoning that anything is possible when dealing with an unnatural phenomena like UFOs, especially when they are thought to be under the control of super- intelligent beings. The analyses reported here were performed on enlarged color photographic reproductions of the original Polaroid prints supplied by Mr. Walter Andrus, Jr. and on photographs reproduced in Gulf Breeze Sightings [1]. The original Polaroid prints, reportedly exposed by Edward and Frances Walters in Gulf Breeze, Florida between November 11, 1987 and May 1, 1988, were not made available for our analysis. All of the photographs contain images of objects of unknown origin reported by the Walters to be unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the various scenes at the times the photographs were exposed. OBJECTIVES The objectives of this study are to describe the conditions under which these images could have been obtained and ex- plain the phenomena depicted, 1) based on detailed scien- tific examination of the photographs and 2) ruled by the limita- tions imposed by the assumptions listed below. ASSUMPTIONS The analyses of the above photographs were performed on the basis of the following assumptions: 1) The original photographs numbered 1 to 24 were recorded on Polacolor Instant Pack Film. The model number of the Polaroid camera used to expose these photographs is unknown (the Model 108 Polaroid camera specified by Edward and Frances Walters as the camera used to record these images [2] is unknown to the Polaroid Corporation [3]). 2) The original photographs numbered 25 to 34 were recorded in a Nimslo camera. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 291 July 1992"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"3) The original photographs numbered 35 and higher were SX-70 Polaroid photographs reportedly recorded in Sun 600 cameras with automatic flash. 4) The color enlargements supplied by Mr. Walter Andrus, Jr. for analysis were reported in writing by him to be faithful reproductions of original and \"light blasted\" [4] Polaroid prints within the practical limits of his equipment and exper- tise as a non-professional photographer in producing them. He further indicated that the original Polaroids were il- luminated by overcast skylight and copied on Kodacolor Gold 200 film using a Canon AE-1 camera and a Canon FD 50 mm 1:1.8 lens fitted with a Vivitar close-up lens attachment. The camera was mounted on a tripod and actuated with a cable release to avoid camera vibration. Reflections from the sur- faces of the original Polaroid prints are evident at the extreme edges of some of the reproduced copies because the original prints were not perfectly flat at the edges during the copying operation [5]. 5) Selected physical measurements recorded and reported by Dr. Bruce Maccabee are assumed to be valid data. With the exception of the above assumptions and limitations, all information reported by the Walters and other investigators have been ignored in performing these analyses. Our con- clusions are based entirely on the analyses of the physical evidence depicted in the photographs under the assumed con- ditions expressed above. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES Numbering system. The following photographs supplied by Mr. Andrus were analyzed using the same numbering system employed by the Walters in their book The Gulf Breeze Sightings [1]: Numbers 1, 2, 5, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 36L, 36R, 37L, 37R, 38L and 38R. Photograph numbers 16 and 17 supplied by Mr. Andrus are numbered 17 and 16 respectively in The Gulf Breeze Sightings [1]. Analytical techniques. Enlarged photographs numbered 1-24 were critically evaluated through microscopic, densitometric and colorimetric analyses. Observations and measurements were made from the 8x10 photographic prints supplied by Mr. Walter Andrus, from an enlarged or digitized image taken from each of those prints and from illustrations reproduced in The Gulf Breeze Sightings [1]. The enlarged photographs reportedly made with a Nimslo camera were of little value to us in the 8x10 print form made available to us for evalua- tion. The stereo photographs reportedly made with a pair of Sun 600 self-referencing stereo (SRS) cameras were of no photogrammetric value to us under the above guidelines because 1) the simultaneity of the two exposures and 2) the distance between the two cameras reported by the Walters [6] could not be verified through direct analyses of the photographic images. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 1. Stripe marks. Vertical stripe marks extending through the UFO-like objects .are apparent in photographs numbered 5, 13, 19 and 21. These could easily be misconstrued as lines of support for UFO models. Although we cannot totally dis- count this theory, our analyses of the images supplied to us suggest that these lines are simply anomalies of film develop-; ment by the Polaroid diffusion-reversal-transfer (DRT) pro- cess, which most often occur in old Polaroid cameras having roller systems that are either encrusted with dried developer gel or out of adjustment. 2. The blue beam. Two scientific explanations apply to the blue beam recorded in photograph number 11. The beam is visible in the photograph because i) the atmosphere enveloped by the beam is rendered luminous (ionization of air molecules, for example) by an energy source of unknown type and origin, or ii) particles in the air are scattering light from a projected beam of light apparently originating from the back side of the UFO-like object. The first explanation is supported by the following observations: i) the ground beneath the beam does not appear to be illuminated as it would be by an in- tense beam of light (unless trees, bushes or other objects in the foreground obscure the lower portion of the beam) and ii) the blue coloration is characteristic of the discharge-tube spectrum of nitrogen, the primary constituent of air. The per- sistent spectral lines for nitrogen are predominantly in the blue and yellow-green regions of the spectrum ranging from 4097 to 4110 and 5676 to 5680 Angstroms. The second ex- planation is suggestive of trick photography 3 in which a beam of light is made visible by introducing particles (blow- ing smoke for example) into the beam. Unfortunately, neither of these explanations can be either proved or disproved on the basis of the images made available to us for analysis. 3. Object luminances. The images representing UFOs (in- cluding the dark rectangular areas in the Walters' UFO draw- ings [7]) in all photographs analyzed are either slightly lighter or no darker than their proximate scenic backgrounds, in- dicating that the objects are either i) self luminous, ii) inter- nally illuminated or iii) externally illuminated from the general direction of the camera position to luminance levels equal to or slightly greater than their proximate backgrounds, or iv) misrepresented through image manipulation 3 . These conclusions were drawn from the computer-generated data derived from the photographs by Dr. James B. Hyzer. The images of the UFO-like objects were digitized to a spatial resolution of 640 (H) by 480 (V) pixels with 256 grey levels per pixel. Linear scans of image density were recorded across the images of the UFO-like objects to show the density pro- files of the proximate background of the object (usually the surrounding sky) and the object itself including the so-called \"portholes\" or other black areas in the object. A typical den- sity profile is shown in Figure 1, which was derived from MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 291 July 1992"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"photograph number 5. A slight spatial variation in apparent sky brightness resulting in a negative density gradient is evi- dent in this plot. The three \"portholes\" that are visible in the image are shown to be brighter than the object's prox- imate background (the sky, in this case) and become suc- cessively darker with nearly the same density gradient as that of the background sky. The \"portholes\" in photograph numbers 1, 2, 5, 9, 11, 13, 19, 21 and 22 were all scanned as described above and in no case was the image density at any \"porthole\" found to be darker than the object's proximate background. 4. Chameleon-like characteristics. The images representing UFOs in all photographs analyzed are of the same colora- tions as their proximate scenic backgrounds, indicating that the objects are either i) semi-transparent, ii) color variable or iii) misrepresented through image manipulation. Objects appearing against a twilight sky (namely numbers 1-9, 11 and 18) are particularly interesting because their images have assumed the same colorations as the surrounding blue sky. The three images recorded in photograph number 18 serve to illustrate this phenomenon when one compares the lower left (LL) object to the lower right (LR) and upper left (UL) objects. The line of sight between the camera and the lower portion of object LL intersects a blue-colored region of the sky in the twilight zone. Camera lines of sight through ob- jects LR, UL and the upper portion of LL all intersect black regions of the sky. The characteristic blue color of the twilight sky is clearly evident between the so-called \"power ring\" and the central body of the LL object. The same areas within ob- jects LR and UR also closely match the color of the surround- ing sky, but in these images the color is dark gray. The cen- tral bodies of all three objects match the gray coloration of the surrounding sky. There is blue sky in photograph number 19, but in this case the object, which appears dark gray in the photograph, is not imaged against the sky, but against trees having the same coloration as the object. The only photographs in which the UFO-like objects are blue are those in which blue sky appears directly behind the objects. This chameleon-like characteristic of the UFO-like objects is evi- dent in all of the photographs analyzed. 5. Partial obscuration. Photograph numbers 1 and 7 are uni- que among those analyzed because the UFO-like objects ap- pear to be partially obscured by tree branches in the foreground. If a chameleon-like ability is accepted as a valid explanation of the phenomenon observed in photograph number 18, it is also reasonable to assume that the objects may not have been behind trees at all, but in front of them. The objects' ability to alter their patterns of luminance and coloration to match their backgrounds along the unique lines of sight of the camera would permit them to create the illu- sion that they are farther away and larger in size than they actually area. The partial obscuration of the UFO-like ob- jects depicted in these photographs could be misinterpreted as proof that multiple-exposure techniques were not employed 250 125 PORTHOLES SKY 30O PIXEL NO. 600 Figure 1: Computer-generated image-density profile across the UFO- like object depicted in photograph number 5.

Multiple-exposure techniques. For the benefit of those readers who are unwilling to accept the UFOs' chameleon- like abilities as scientifically feasible, image manipulation of- fers an alternative explanation. There are several ways this kind of trick photography could have been accomplished in producing photograph numbers 1 and 7, but the simplest, most direct approach is by sequential multiple exposure on the same sheet of peel-apart Polacolor film in which i) a model of a UFO posed against a black background is exposed to a light level just below the exposure threshold-response level of the diffusion-reversal-transfer (DRT) process employed in these films and ii) the horizon scene is exposed normally or somewhat underexposed. The image of the model UFO in the Polaroid print will not be visible to the eye nor detect- able by photometric instruments against anything black in the scene because the combined exposures of the model and the black background are still below the exposure threshold- response level of the DRT process that produces a positive color print from the exposed negative. Essentially, no image of the model is transferred to the print from the negative at exposures below the exposure threshold-response level of the DRT process. Owing to the non-linear exposure-response characteristic of the DRT process however, the model UFO will become visible when the combined exposures of the model and the sky behind it exceed the process's exposure threshold-response level. Exposure of the model added to the exposure of the sky will produce a visible image of the model MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 291 July 1992"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"against the sky background. Image visibility is increased significantly by extending the processing time of Polacolor film to 15 minutes or so before peeling the positive print from the negative. This results in a near doubling of the contrast between the model and its proximate background without any significant change in the exposure threshold-response level (see appendix A). With extended processing, the blacks are blacker and the sky appears bluer. Under optimal conditions, a 20% contrast between the model and its sky background is obtainable with extended processing, which is 10 times the eye's threshold contrast sensitivity level of about 2% and is representative of the contrast evident in photograph numbers 1 and 7. Optimum exposures in the film plane for multiple- exposed images of a model and its sky background range from approximately 0.002 to 0.004 mcs for the model and 0.012 to 0.05 mcs for the sky on Polacolor Instant Pack Film b . All of the techniques described above have been demonstrated in practice. Since they are based upon the use of Polaroid Land instant film, optimum results can be quickly and easi- ly obtained on the spot through simple trial-and-error varia- tions in exposure by rank photographic amateurs. Knowledge of photography is by no means a prerequisite for success in this kind of photographic fakery. A more detailed account accompanied with exemplary photographs is the subject of another article by the author [8]. A similar multiple-exposure technique is applicable to all of the photographic images analyzed for this report, including those recorded on other films, except that the exposures used in photographing models that are not par- tially obscured by foreground objects are far less critical than those employed in photograph numbers 1 and 7. The exposures in these other cases would normally be greater than the ex- posure threshold-response level of the film. In all instances in which this multiple-exposure method is used, all portions of the models will either appear brighter or no darker than their proximate scenic backgrounds and background colora- tions will be evident in the images of the models — two con- ditions that do prevail in all of the photographs analyzed for this report. It is also interesting to note that any spatial varia- tion in intensity of the background will also be evident across the darker areas of the object — a condition that was found to exist in photograph number 5 and quantified in Figure 1. 7. Image blur. Image-edge analysis was precluded as a viable means of verifying the authenticity of the Walters' photographs provided to us for analysis. Ambiguities result from the con- dition that both the UFO-like objects (real or unreal) and the camera are independently subject to motion during exposure. Photograph numbers 1-9 for example, show varying degrees and directions of blur in the images of the UFO-like objects and their scenic backgrounds. Unfortunately, we were not given photograph numbers 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 10 for analysis. Some of these reportedly show blurred backgrounds with relatively sharp images of the UFO-like objects. A blurred stationary background is indicative of camera movement. A blurred UFO image might be caused either by object mo- tion, camera movement or a combination of both. It is possi- ble, as in photograph number 9, to obtain a sharply defined object against a blurred background. This anomaly results i) when the camera is moved in the same direction and angular rate as the object is moving or ii) in executing a double ex- posure in which the camera is fixed in position while photographing a stationary UFO model, but is moved while exposing the scenic background. Another example of a blurred image is photograph number 21, except in this case the image of the UFO-like object is smeared vertically in the photograph as a result of either ob- ject motion, camera movement or a combination of both. The foreground image of a car rack is exposed by the camera's flash and is relatively sharp. The effective exposure time for this foreground object illuminated soley by flash is no longer than the flash duration, or approximately 1/50 second. The effective exposure time for the self-luminous UFO-like ob- ject in the background is determined by the camera shutter speed, which could range from a fraction of a second to a second or more in duration. The above conditions apply to images recorded simultaneously, as in the case of a real UFO, or sequentially, in which case the image was faked by multiple- exposure photography. Image analysis is incapable of solv- ing the ambiguities associated with images of this type from either the half-tone images reproduced in The Gulf Breeze Sightings [1] or the limited selection of photographic copies made available to us for our evaluation. 8. Abnormal road reflections. Estimates vary as to the size and location of the UFO-like object in photograph number 19. Based upon a camera-to-object distance of 185 feet, with the object directly over the pattern of light in the roadway surface, Maccabee in 1988 [9] reported its size to be approx- imately 13 feet in diameter at its widest point and 9 feet high from the bottom of the power ring to the so-called \"dome light.\" The top of the object is tilted between 10° and 12° away from the camera, so that the maximum vertical height of the band of light emitted from the power ring is approximately 4- !/2 feet above the ground. The abnormally \"fat\" shape of the pattern of light on the roadway surface lead some analysts to question the validity of photograph number 19. Consequently, Maccabee in 1990 [10] revised his earlier determinations of object location and size. He recalculated the camera-to-object distance to be 370 feet, which is twice his earlier determination of 185 feet. At two times the distance, the size of the UFO-like object would also be larger by a factor of two. In this latter case, the top of the power ring would be 5 feet above ground level and the pattern of light on the road surface would extend over an area ranging from 64 feet to 127 feet in front of the object. The above change in object size and location was an at- tempt to explain away the abnormally \"fat\" shape of the reflec- tion pattern on the roadway, but it failed to account for the absence of diffuse reflected light from the pavement directly underneath and only two feet away from the highly luminous MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 291 July 1992"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"power ring. Our photometric analysis did not reveal any significant variation in roadway luminances in areas beneath and surrounding the UFO-like object. There should be a pat- tern of increased pavement luminance directly beneath the power ring, but there wasn't. 9. Missing hood reflections. The absence of the reflected im- age of the UFCMike object in the hood of Walters' model 150 XLT Ford truck in photograph number 19 was reported to have been first observed by Mr. Ray Stanford, who also was reported to have noted that the reflected image of the tree line, which appears behind the object, is clearly visible in photograph number 19 and in the daytime photograph recorded at the same location as photograph 19, which we will refer to in this report as number 19A. There are three color plates of photograph number 19, which appear with photograph number 19A on the page proceeding page 129 in The Gulf Breeze Sightings [1]. There are three sources of light produced by the UFO-like object: 1) the crescent-shaped illuminated dome and dome light at the top of the object, 2) the light from the power ring on the underside of the object and 3) the light reflected from the surface of the roadway. A photometric analysis of photograph number 19 has shown that the crescent-shaped luminance pattern directly beneath the dome light on the top surface of the UFO-like object is less luminous than the dome light and slightly brighter than the overcast sky above the tree line. None of these light sources are visible as reflections in the hood of the truck in photograph number 19, although all of them are brighter than the overcast sky in the background, which is visible as a reflection. The mirror-like surface of the truck's hood is apparent in photograph numbers 19 and 19A by comparing features along the skyline with their reflected images. These reflected im- ages are inverted, with foreground features closer to the front of the hood than background features. The truck is not oriented quite the same in the above two photographs, as indicated by the crease line that runs down the center of the hood. The truck is in the proper orientation in photograph number 19 to produce visible reflections from the position occupied by the UFO-like object depicted in that photograph. A series of experiments were performed in cooperation with Mr. Rex Salisberry in an attempt to duplicate the conditions that appear to exist in photograph number 19; namely to place a source of light in front of a Ford 150 XLT truck in such a position that its reflection in the truck's hood can not be seen nor photographed through the windshield. Distances between the light source and the front of the truck were varied from 500 down to 20 feet. The light source was moved laterally from 30 feet left to 30 feet right of centerline and vertically from ground level up to 10 feet above ground in attempting to find a light-source posi- tion where its reflection could not be seen through the truck's windshield from any location on the driver's side of the cab. Light-source reflections were visible for all light-source distances down to 22 feet when the source was held at ground level. At less than about a 22-foot distance, the source and its reflection appeared to merge into a single spot of light. The reflected image of the light source was visible at closer distances when the source was raised above ground level and approached zero distance in front of the truck at hood level. The truck's hood was clean in the first series of tests; then the experiments were repeated with a dust-covered hood. Reflected images of the light sources were clearly visible under all of the above conditions. A typical photograph documenting this series of experiments is shown in Figure 2. Light-reflection experiments reportedly performed on the actual truck that appears in photograph number 19 were described by Bruce Maccabee, who writes: \"By holding a flashlight at various heights above the road and about 200 feet away it was determined that no reflection appeared until the light was seven or more feet above the road\" [11]V He subsequently reduced that seven-foot distance to six feet [12]. The above author further points out in the same article [11] that the front of the hood was bent by a collision, so there was a minimum height above ground level from where a light source would have been seen as a reflection in the truck's hood d . We conclude from Maccabee's statements that reflec- tions would be visible in photograph number 19 from light sources that were six feet or more above ground level at 200 feet away. Based strictly upon the above reflected-light experiments conducted on Walters' truck and the range of Maccabee's estimates of object sizes and locations, neither the light pat- tern on the roadway surface nor the power ring would be visi- ble as hood reflections at the 185-foot camera-to-object distance, because the vertical distance to the top of the power ring would fall l-Vi feet short of the six-foot minimum height required for a reflection to be seen. If the camera-to-object distance is 370 feet, the power-ring elevation would be one foot short of the six-foot minimum. Considering the 2:1 range of estimates of the object location and size, these 1 to l-'/a foot differentials probably fall within the limits of error in measuring the height of the object above ground, in which case the top of the power ring could exceed the six-foot limit. In fact, one way to explain the absence of increased ground luminance beneath the power ring at the 370-foot distance, is to assume that the UFO-like object is more than two feet above the pavement. In any event, the crescent-shaped il- luminated dome and dome light on the UFO-like object are sufficiently high to produce visible reflections at both camera- to-object distances of 185 feet and 370 feet. Both the empirical findings resulting from the above tests and the visible tree reflections in the image were found to be very useful in locating the area in photograph number 19 where the reflections should appear in the hood of the truck. In searching this and surrounding areas in the photograph for a reflected-light pattern that is representative of the crescent- shaped illuminated dome and dome light, consideration was given to the possibility that part of that reflected image might be obscured by one of the circular white \"air bells\" in MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 291 July 1992"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Figure 2: A typical photograph showing reflections in the hood of a Ford 150 XLT truck.

There was no evidence to support this theory. No reflected images associated with the UFO- like object were detected in the truck's hood in photograph number 19. It is this author's professional opinion that the results of this study are conclusive: if the UFO-like object in photograph number 19 had been real, reflections of luminous sources associated with the object, and most certainly the crescent- shaped illuminated dome and dome light at the top of the ob- ject, would have to be visible in the truck's hood; but they are not. CONCLUDING REMARKS The Walters' photographs of the Gulf Breeze sightings ana- lyzed for this report: are they bona fide or bogus? What unknown forces propel these wingless craft and support them as they hover overhead? How do they achieve their amazing chameleon-like abilities to change in brightness and color and blend with the background? And the luminous blue beam that appears to terminate in mid air: what is it? Before we com- pleted our analysis of photograph number 19 we were at a loss to answer these questions on scientific grounds, except to say that the images which depict all of these strange and unnatural phenomena are uniquely characteristic of multiple- exposure photography and could have been easily produced by the simple application of this technique. The missing reflections in the hood of the truck and the abnormal road luminance in photograph number 19 provide the answers to the question of its authenticity. It is this author's professional opinion that there is only one logical explanation for all of the optical anomalies described in this report: photograph number 19 is a fake a produced by multiple-exposure photography. FOOTNOTES a. The terms image manipulation, trick photography and photographic fakery refer to techniques of producing a photographic image which is altered in such a way as to misrepresent the object or scene recorded by the camera. Photographic misrepresentation can be accomplished in a variety of ways: through the use of mirrors, rear-projection methods, multiple-exposure techniques, digital image process- ing, manual image retouching, paste ups, etc. A fake photograph is one that has been reproduced by one of these methods. b. An example of a 0.05 meter-candle-second (mcs) camera exposure is a twilight sky having a luminance of about 4 milli- lamberts exposed at a lens setting of f/9.2 for 1/2 second. c. Light emitted by the UFO-like object's so-called \"power ring\" and the adjacent light pattern referred to as a \"road MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 291 July 1992"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"reflection\" combine to form a bright and rather large source approximately 3-!/2° by 2° in size when viewed from the camera position. The angle subtended at the camera's lens between this source and a point on the truck's hood where its reflection should appear is approximately 10-Vi 0 . By com- parison, a flashlight 200 feet away is essentially a point source having a subtended angle of only 1/10° or so in size. The visibilities of reflected images from the camera position im- prove as both brightnesses and angular sizes of the sources are increased. The angles subtended between the sky line and its reflected image in the truck's hood range from about 18° to 20° at the position of the camera. d. The hood of the truck is a compound convex reflecting surface that will reflect light from a source to the lens of the camera under the condition that a line extending from the camera lens to the source falls above a line extending from the camera lens to a point of tangency on the hood surface. When this condition is met, there is a unique position on the convex surface that fulfills the optical requirement that the angle of reflection to the camera lens relative to a line drawn tangent to the reflecting surface at the point of reflection must equal the angle of incidence relative to the same tangent line. Reflected images are visible in convex surfaces ranging from extremely small to large radii of curvature.

Basiago Was Lockheed consultant an agent of the Cosmic Watergate? F or several years, controversial voices have sounded in UFO circles, telling a terrifying story. The government, these critics say, is perpetrating a cosmic Watergate. Extraterrestrial humanoids are visiting our civilization. Some of these beings have crashed their spaceships on our planet. These crashed saucers have been recovered by special military teams. The saucers — even their occupants — are being studied at a supersecret base in Nevada. At this base, scien- tists are busily endeavoring to \"reverse engineer\" alien flight technology and plumb the complexity of alien anatomy. The base is called \"Dreamland.\" Area 51 is where Dreamland is allegedly located. Area 51, we know, is a real and not a fictional place. The northwestern corner of the vast Nevada Test Range near Nellis Air Force Base, Area 51 is encircled by the austere majesty of the Groom Mountains and unpopulated stretches of surrounding desert. Area 51 is a perfect place for the military-industrial complex to tinker with Space Age toys. In fact, experimental aircraft have streaked across the skies of Area 51 for decades. In the 1950s, Area 51 was where the U-2 spy plane was tested. Here, U-2 pilot Frances Gary Powers, who was shot down and cap- tured in May 1960 while on a spy flight deep inside the USSR, was trained. Area 51 was a testing ground for the spy plane, the SR-71, which allowed the Central Intelligence Agency [CIA] to detect Soviet nuclear missile installations in Cuba in 1962. In recent years, Area 51 was where the Stealth bomber was developed and perfected. Area 51 is secured terrain. Displayed on aeronautical maps, it cannot be overflown by civilian planes. Nor can it be trespassed by unauthorized in- dividuals on the ground. Charges by UFO proponents that the government is engaged in an active program to direct downed extraterrestrial craft to Area 51 for research and development purposes are as impor- tant as they are provocative. If Area 51 has been commissioned as a UFO laboratory, then the government is engaged in a con- spiracy that denies the existence of UFOs while researching their very design. The allegations of a young engineer, Robert Lazar, in 1989, that he witnessed flying saucers being test- flown at Area 51, were compelling and believable. What the UFO community has lacked is a factual nexus linking Area 51 to the agencies that have, as revealed in government documents declassified under the Freedom of Information Act [FOIA], shown keen interest in UFOs — the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency. Missing from the story of Area 51 has been a \"Deep Throat\" from the intelligence community whose story confirms the existence of Dreamland. A good candidate for the role of \"Deep Throat\" of the Cosmic Watergate is Marion Leo Williams — a voice UFO researchers will not hear. Leo Williams died in 1989. But his untold story is a story that should be told, for it links Dreamland to the CIA and provides additional evidence of a UFO study effort. Williams first made his allegations about government con- cealment of extraterrestrial visitations to Earth to a relative in 1976. In 1981, years before similar claims were made by such individuals as Stanton Friedman, William Moore, Jaime Shandera, John Lear and William Cooper, figures on the UFO-circuit, Williams' relative shared his secrets with this reporter. Before succumbing to cancer in 1989, a cancer he linked to the radioactive materials he handled during a long career with the CIA, Williams recounted his career as a government operative, and later, as a Lockheed consultant who visited the \"Top Secret\" UFO research Area 51. The allegations by Williams' relative about his career are worth reporting at some length: Williams entered the clandestine service with the Office of Strategic Services, the CIA's precursor, during World War II. Stationed in Burma, he participated in the operation that flooded the Japanese empire with counterfeit yen in order to cause inflation and foil Japan's dreams of conquest. After graduating from the University of Kansas at Wichita in 1953 with degrees in engineering and history, Williams joined the CIA. Williams worked for the CIA on numerous \"jumps\" for 30 years. As a CIA agent, Williams returned to Burma, where he organized Burmese tribesmen to recover downed low-flying satellites completed reconnaissance missions over China. In another assignment for the agency, he was a member of a secret team that brought pieces of the Chinese atomic bomb out of the People's Republic of China. His assignments for the intelligence agency took Williams to China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam and Thailand. D uring the late 1960s and 1970s, Williams returned to the United States, where he was active in counter- intelligence, primarily in securing United States defense in- telligence bases from being penetrated by KGB agents and their lackeys. This work afforded Williams a security clearance that allowed him access to numerous defense intelligence facilities around the world. Such bases can only be entered after the person seeking access places a thumb against a finger- print identification system or an eye before the lens of a retinal scanner. But even Williams was impressed by what he des- cribed as the \"top, top, top, top, top secret\" UFO research lab that he visited and that has since come to be known as Dreamland. According to Williams' relative, a stable and successful pro- fessional who is deemed highly credible by this writer, Williams developed cataracts in the 1970s, and left the CIA Mr. Basiago is a West Coast investigative reporter and lawyer, and former Contributing Writer for the Cousteau Society's Calypso Log. This is his first article for the Journal, but we hope it will not be his last. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 291 July 1992"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"to go to work for the aerospace firm Lockheed. Williams was told that Lockheed was supplying equipment to a supersecret laboratory in Nevada dedicated to exploiting the technologies of crashed UFOs and studying the bi- ologies of their occupants. Williams' job for Lockheed was to acquire parts from foreign manufacturers to secure and outfit the base.  ^^^^^^^^ Williams recalled that he had been flown to the lab several times as part of his assign- ment for Lockheed. He reported being transported to Dreamland in planes and buses with blacked-out windows so that he re- mained ignorant of the base's location. Much of Dreamland was underground or recessed into the surrounding desert terrain. The large- ly underground elevators and security locks were built with so many advanced control ~\"~~~^~\" systems that it was common knowledge among those who had visited Dreamland that it formed the basis for the virus-control fortress featured in the film The Andromeda Strain. Williams' relative claims that Williams sometimes called Dreamland \"The Ranch,\" which parallels aspects of the MJ-12 literature. The theme of the ailing CIA agent's revelations to his relative was that because he was dying and had no reason to fear retaliation for breaking his secrecy oath, he wanted his relative to know that the Earth is being visited by a non- human intelligent species, that American government re- searchers are busy conducting genetic studies of intact alien corpses recovered from crashed alien spacecraft and that design principles deduced from the saucers have been uti- lized in the Stealth bomber. Williams' story closely mirrors that of the young physicist Lazar. In May 1989, Lazar agreed to be interviewed on a con- fidential basis by reporter George Knapp of Las Vegas televi- sion station KLAS. At that time, Lazar, interviewed in shadows so that his identity would not be revealed, reported that there are nine flying saucers at Dreamland, all of extraterrestrial origin. After his life was threatened by his supervisor at Dreamland, Lazar stepped forward to reveal his identity, and in November 1989 he spoke at length with Knapp on camera, asserting that the publicity would protect him from retaliation. Lazar told Knapp that he was hired to work at Dreamland by the United States Navy, following an interview at the high technology firm E.G.&G. According to Lazar, he was assigned to work in a region of Area 51 described as \"S-4\" on govern- ment maps. Lazar would report for work at a meeting place near E.G.&G. and fly to Groom Lake. There, only a few in- dividuals would board a bus for the final journey to S-4. The windows of the bus were blacked-out so that the passengers could not learn the precise location of Dreamland. The exterior of Dreamland, Lazar said, has a slope of about 30 degrees. The structure in which Dreamland is housed con- sists of two hangar doors textured to look like sand to disguise it from Soviet satellites passing overhead. On his first day at Dreamland, Lazar said, he was informed that he would be conducting research into advanced propul- Then one day Lazar was permitted to look inside one of the craft. If these are being designed for human pilots, he won- dered, why do they have such tiny seats? sion systems, and was asked to read various briefing documents. Rather quickly, as the young physicist read the documents and was introduced to the working of the lab, Lazar was astonished by the level of technological inquiry under- taken at Dreamland. According to Lazar, the propulsion systems he was assigned to study used as their power source ^— anti-matter reactors. The propulsion system consisted of a two-part mechanism that used gravity as a wave with \"wave guides\" almost like microwaves. The craft at Dreamland, Lazar claimed, were propelled by way of gravity amplification. By tremendously amplifying gravitational energy, they bend time and space around them, so that when the gravity amplifier is switched off, the craft has moved a tremendous distance in space, ^^^^\"\"~^ but with virtually no passage of time. The fuel source for this propulsion system, Lazar told Knapp, was Element 115, which cannot be made on Earth, but which the government he said has 500 pounds of. By bom- barding Element 115, anti-matter is produced, which propels the saucers. A kilo of anti-matter would be the most power- ful fuel source ever to be held in human hands, for it represents the energy equivalent of 46 10-megaton bombs. Lazar said that Element 115 could never be manufactured on Earth, where it would have to be assembled by bombarding it one proton at a time, which would take an infinite amount of time and energy to accomplish. Instead, Element 115 has to come from a place where superheavy elements have been produced naturally — such as a binary star system, a supernova or some other cosmic environment where there is an almost in- estimable release of energy. The presence of Element 115 in government stockplies, Lazar posited, points logically to the conclusion that the government has either colluded with aliens to receive it, or has gathered it from downed alien craft. A s days passed at Dreamland, Lazar was introduced to the entire facility. He learned that the nine different disks being studied occupy a series of nine connected hangars separated by huge bay doors. One saucer had apparently been pierced by a projectile. In one demonstration, Lazar was per- mitted to watch a disk rise some 30 feet from the ground. Initially, Lazar chose not to believe that he had been ad- mitted into the inner sanctum of a secret military base where recovered alien spacecraft are being stored, studied and flight- tested. Rather, he chose to entertain the notion that the Dreamland research team was just another group of advanced government scientists exploiting \"flying wing\" technology that emerged after World War II. Then, one day, Lazar told Knapp, he was permitted to look inside one of the craft. If these are being designed for human pilots, he wondered, why do they have such tiny seats? Soon, it clicked. The little fur- niture had been fashioned for the diminutive bodies of nonhuman extraterrestrials. Dreamland was a place not of original research but a place where alien flight technology was reverse-engineered. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 291 July 1992"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Note the similarity between Williams' story and that of Lazar. • Both Williams and Lazar reported having been employed in advanced military research — Williams as a CIA liaison to Lockheed procuring vital defense parts from around the world, Lazar as a research physicist for another defense con- tractor, E.G.&G. • Both men reported having been transported to a base in the Nevada Desert in vehicles with blacked-out windows. • Both reported that the base was partially or substantially underground. • Both reported a supersecret level of security at the base. In addition, Lazar claimed that guards pointed guns at him and threatened his life to make him comply with the secrecy regime. • Both reported having been told that recovered craft of extraterrestrial origin were located at the facility. • Both reported that the base was dedicated to an ongoing investigation to ascertain how the craft worked. • Both reported that their expertise was needed by the UFO study effort. Williams sourced parts from around the world on behalf of the base, whereas Lazar studied the craft's pro- pulsion systems. • Williams claimed to have been told only that the craft were at the facility, whereas Lazar claimed to have actually seen the craft. It is logical, therefore, that Lazar, but not Williams, would be intimidated at gunpoint, for he was al- lowed to see the UFOs and work on the saucer investigation, whereas Williams was only informed of the base's mission. These similarities establish that the confessions of retired CIA agent Williams substantially foretold Lazar's disputed 1989 allegations. What kind of base these men visited remains open to speculation. On the one hand, the base Williams and Lazar visited may be dedicated to military research into recovered UFOs of ex- traterrestrial origin. But that explanation is susceptible to criticism. It is doubtful that the military would provocative- ly down extraterrestrial craft with hostile fire, or even has the technology to do so, given the wealth of data describing UFOs as impervious to human weapon systems. Furthermore, it is doubtful that, somehow, visitors from \"out there\" would be capable of getting \"here\" across the vast reaches of space, only to crash when they got here. On the other hand, the base Williams and Lazar visited may be dedicated to advanced military research of entirely terrestrial origin. Perhaps their military supervisors convinced them the craft were not of this world to achieve some secrecy objective. Reasons an \"extraterrestrial cover story\" would have been placed over a Pentagon research project into alternative flight technologies might include a desire to keep such technology out of the hand of other nations, tort liability associated with flying experimental craft over populated areas or the sensitive origins of such technology (e.g., perhaps the UFOs were developed by some of the 1,500 Nazi scientists the CIA secreted into this country after World War II in \"Operation Paperclip.\") These explanations, of course, are, in turn, susceptible to the criticism that UFO sightings have for decades been a global phenomenon and that the fact that some UFOs are of intelligent extraterrestrial origin is sug- gested by a growing body of close encounter and abduction evidence. In any case, Williams' story provides more tantalizing evidence of a cosmic Watergate. A variety of individuals are reporting that a reality of high strangeness has emerged on a secreted expanse of the Nevada desert. Dreamland may be a real and not a chimerical place. If it is — if the government has evidence proving the existence of life beyond this planet, such information must be disclosed in order that human knowledge of the nature of the universe be advanced. Why such a laboratory of cosmic inquiry has apparently remained only an imaginary Dreamland for humanity at large is a topic to be pursued with diligence and vigor on behalf of the world community that would be enlightened by such information. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 291 July 1992"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"THE UFO PRESS CRASH AT CORONA: The U.S. Military Retrieval and Cover-Up of a UFO By Stanton T. Friedman and Don Berliner Paragon House 90 Fifth Avenue New York, NY 10011 1-800-PARAGON Hardcover, 224 pages, $19.95 Available August 1992 Reviewed by J.R. Johnson F ollowers of the flying saucer mystery have long awaited this book, the hoped-for \"definitive\" volume on the 1947 New Mexico crash event, from the physicist / re- searcher / lecturer Stanton Friedman, who lays claim to \"rediscovering\" in 1978 this, the best-documented and most- likely-to-be-true of the claimed Crash/Retrievals; and the veteran aviation writer Don Berliner of the Fund for UFO Research (FUFOR). Crash at Corona holds no big surprises for those readers of the earlier books on the subject: The Roswell Incident (Charles Berlitz and William Moore, 1980), and last year's UFO Crash at Roswell (Kevin Randle and Donald Schmitt, 1991), but it is a sufficently different work, both in content and viewpoint, that it complements the other two and deserves a place on the researcher's shelf beside them. Crash at Corona seems to be an \"insider's\" book, written more for those who read the specialized literature and attend the lectures than the general public, which was the apparent target audience of UFO Crash at Roswell with its \"docu- drama\" dialog, and the Moore / Berlitz book with its rather sensationalized and questionable chapters on astronaut cases, etc. But I do not wish to leave the impression that Crash at Cor- ona is some kind of dry, formal, technical report; it has some literary merit. One clever idea is the introduction, which presents the 1947 crash event as a newspaper reader of the time would have read about it; the official news release, followed by a flurry of Army Air Forces activity and editorial speculation, followed by General Ramey's pronouncement that it was only a RAWINSONDE balloon, followed by the in- consistent Mac Brazel \"retraction,\" followed by the story just fading into oblivion for thirty or more years. Following that are some chapters best described as \"ye olde historic,\" setting the stage for decades of official silence, press ridicule, and public apathy over the flying saucer issue. In- cluded here are summaries of several Air Force documents that \"would have created shock waves\" and amazed the public had they not been kept secret until the mid-1980s, suggesting a possible extraterrestrial origin of the \"flying disks\" if all other possibilities are eliminated. Included among these is the important intelligence collection memorandum from Generals Schulgen and Twining dated 28 October, 1947 that clearly lists several characteristics of the New Mexico crash debris; things not evident from saucer sighting reports of the time; things that would be evident only from handling and examining actual pieces of one that has landed or crashed. The authors also report the intriguing but so far undocumented story out of Russia that Stalin conferred with his top scien- tists about the flying saucer question following news of the New Mexico crash. It would be interesting to know if the files of the KGB contain anything beyond what their agents gleaned from the press reports of the day. Perhaps copies are for sale. A more modern history follows, that of the slow, piecemeal process of finding and interviewing first and second-hand sources who knew something of the New Mexico crash event or its aftermath, and putting the fragments together to form the still incomplete picture we have today. Friedman takes credit for finding and interviewing three key witnesses (Marcel, Sleppy, Maltais) whose stories converged enough to make him start believing that a crash could have actually happened; a viewpoint decidedly unpopular among resear- chers since the fiasco of Frank Scully and his 1950 publica- tion of claimed saucer crashes where none of the facts of the cases subsequently checked out. D ue credit is given in the book to other people, notably Leonard Stringfield who \"broke the ice\" in the late seven- ties by collecting \"crash / retrieval\" stories from sources he cultivated, organizing them and presenting them through lec- tures and books in such a way that they could no longer be ignored by hoax-wary \"ufologists.\" Credit also to William Moore, who took up the cause when only a few witnesses were known and pursued many others so that the 1980 book and a series of papers published by MUFON in the eighties could provide an ever-growing and more solid body of evidence to eager readers, opening their eyes to the impor- tance of this long-ignored crashed-saucer rumor. Grudging credit even to William Steinman who, even though side-tracked by the old Scully tale, managed to write letters to Dr. Robert Sarbacher while he was alive and to ask the right questions of this scientist who was briefed about recovered craft and their occupants during his work with the Research and Development Board in the 1940s. Names, dates, publications, symposia and organizations are mentioned in this book which will mean a lot more to the student of flying saucers than they will to general readers, but the authors provide a rich bibliography and resource list at the end of the book. Wisely, I think, Friedman and Berliner avoid dwelling on the heated disagreements that have flared over relatively minor points (not the reality or importance of the overall 1947 event) between them and the other two \"teams\" of investigators MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 291 July 1992"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"associated with this case; namely Kevin Randle and Don Schmitt, co-authors of UFO Crash at Roswell, and William Moore and Jaime Shandera (Charles Berlitz now out of the picture). These endless arguments over the desert locations, photographs, number of bodies, and the believability of a recently emerged pre-school-aged \"witness\" have played out in such publications as \"Focus,\" the \"International UFO Reporter\" and the \"MUFON UFO Journal,\" month after month, over several years. Readers of this exchange need not fear that it will be all hashed out again in Crash at Corona. In its place, perhaps, we are offered more meaningful data, such as the verbatim testimony of five civilians who saw and handled pieces of the debris found on the New Mexico ranch (all named, some still living); the testimony of \"F.B.\", an Army Air Forces photographer who photographed bodies in a tent near Corona (not Datil, Corona) who wishes to remain obscure (though it would seem that those most likely to make trouble for him could easily look up his name, rank and serial number!); and the names of many AAF personnel who took part in the recovery effort and aircraft transport of wreckage and bodies. The name of Sheridan Cavitt, the Counter- intelligence Corps officer who would be a key witness if he would allow interviews, or perhaps speak to a Congressional committee (as specifically allowed by U.S.C.18 § 798(c), regardless of whatever secrecy oath he may have taken), ap- pears throughout the book. Cavitt was oddly not mentioned by name in the main text of the Randle and Schmitt book, but referred to as \"the CIC officer,\" despite the fact that those authors admitted contacting him and learning only that he still feels bound to silence. N ot so reluctant to talk is the man who contacted Stanton Friedman following a rather detailed reinactment of the crash event on nationwide television, Gerald Ander- son. Forming the centerpiece of Crash at Corona, the lengthy and amazingly detailed testimony from the man who would have been five years old in July 1947 may well determine how this book is remembered in future years. Without wallowing in details, let me say that the Anderson participation in any crash event is controversial, despite the probability that he did go rock-hunting with his family in certain New Mexico desert locations that he has no trouble finding again decades later. Friedman and Berliner dutifully report much of what Anderson has told them, though they do not make clear which parts, if any, were told before the \"regressive hypnosis\" ses- sions he was subjected to. The authors readily accept Ander- son's identification of an archeologist he met at the saucer crash site as \"Dr. Buskirk,\" who is now discovered to have been a name and face dredged up from much later memories of Anderson's high-school days (see International UFO Reporter, vol. 16 number 6, Nov./Dec. 1991), \"The search for the archeologists\" by Thomas J. Carey, page 4 and front- cover photographs). Should the remainder of Mr. Anderson's memories prove derivative from the Grady Barnett account provided in books, magazines and television programs prior to Anderson's emerg- ence as a \"witness\" to the crash scene, and his supporting documentation fail additional tests of authenticity, then Fried- man and Berliner will take some lumps for not being more neutral in their approach of this data. But the overall story of the recovered wreckage of something highly unusual in 1947 will not go away because it is based upon many more witnesses who clearly were there at the time, and documents both public and official that announced, if only briefly, the historic event. Don Berliner's contributions to the book are most in evidence in chapter 11, which is an expansion of his paper issued through FUFOR on alternative explanations for the wreckage, where he argues forcefully that no mundane ob- ject from 1947 would fit the parameters of what is known about the crash debris; and chapter 13, which speculates how the government organized the study and containment of the crash remains following the initial event. This seems to follow portions of a paper Berliner presented at the MUFON 1989 International UFO Symposium and published in its Pro- ceedings. His savvy as a writer also comes through in the chapter where a modern-day return to the Corona site in a fruitless search for any remaining physical evidence is des- cribed, rather poetically. Berliner and Friedman separate in the interesting Chapter 15, where each speculate upon the effects that full public disclosure of the reality of the discovery of crashed saucers and alien bodies, then and now, might have on society. Though I prefer information to speculation in my flying saucer books, this is informed speculation covering much ground and representing the thoughts of two experts who have lived with the reality of all this for a rather long time, and I respect their ideas. Let me say that neither paints a rosy picture of a future filled with \"spiritual evolvement\" or anything of the sort. Both authors come together in recognizing the public's right to know the truth, and call upon those who may know any more than has already been publicized about the New Mexico crash(es) to come forward and share their knowledge. I have no doubt more will do so.

I have been neither. While it has seemed to me that there's some pretty interesting intra-psychic stuff going on for UFO experiences, I have felt that to dismiss their experiences as nothing but hallucinations and/or delu- sions was very short-sighted. Recently, articles and books have been appearing which offer various alternative explanations which avoid these polarized positions, and I was delighted to read Ken Ring's new book which not only offers some in- teresting theories, but has solid statistical data to back them up. Ring's basic position is that those who have had UFO Ex- periences and those who have had Near-Death Experiences (a group about whom he has previously written at some length) have a number of characteristics in common. Call- ing those individuals who are likely to have experiences of these sorts \"encounter-prone personalities\" or \"psychological sensitives,\" he shows that they have histories of experienc- ing abuse and trauma in childhood, they are likely to utilize dissociation as a psychological defense mechanism, they are already attuned to alternate realities, and they have a strong tendency toward psychological absorption. Insisting that these experiences cannot be explained away as Wilson and Barber have attempted to do in their positing of the \"fantasy-prone personality,\" Ring argues that these ex- periencers are tapping into a realm that in some sense truly exists outside of time and space. Following the lead of Henry Corbin, he labels this realm the imaginal realm and argues that access to it is dependent neither on sensory perception nor on normal waking cognition (including fantasy) but rather is available only through certain altered states of consciousness. The data generated from responses to his \"Life Changes Inventory\" indicate that, among other things, experiences of these phenomena have an increased appreciation of life, a greater self-acceptance, a deeper concern for others, an ex- panded level of spirituality, and a heightened level of con- cern with social / planetary issues. This information leads Ring to assert that these experiences could be marking the beginning stages of a major shift in levels of consciousness that will eventually lead to humanity's being able to live in two worlds at once - the physical and the imaginal - a shift which may be precisely what is necessary for the human race to survive the environmental, political and spiritual crises in which we are currently embroiled. Not only is the book highly informative, it is also delightful- ly fun and easy to read. Ken Ring is one of the few authors I know of who is able to write about countless reams of statistical data in a way that is so folksy and comfortable that it reads like a script for Prairie Home Companion. In addi- tion to recommending it to those who are interested in UFO Experiences and Near-Death Experiences, I also highly recommend it to anyone interested in any of the transpersonal phenomena, dissociation or creativity.

The time was about 11 p.m., when the lookout and some of the passengers noticed a brilliant light approaching rapidly, overtaking the ship and losing altitude as it did so. The light lost speed and descended to within 50 feet of the water. Then it beamed down a brilliant searching light that cast a diminishing circle on the surface of the sea as the object matched its speed with that of the ship. Suddenly the searchlight beam went out ... and then the object itself became visible. All aboard the vessel who saw the thing agreed that it was a gigantic cylindrical craft of some sort, apparently metallic and about five times as long as its diameter. It looked, said the witnesses, like a huge steel cigar with the end clipped. No windows or portholes could be seen. From the ease and precision with which it matched its speed to that of the steamship and from the use of the searchlight, it was quite apparent that the craft was under intelligent con- trol of some sort. The size of the craft was nothing less than gigantic; some witnesses estimated that the thing was three to four times as long as the steamship, which meant that it would have been at least 1600 feet long and about 300 feet thick. After cruising along beside the Llandovery Castle for perhaps a minute, the gigantic structure began to rise silent- ly until it was about 1000 feet above the water, then great orange streamers of flame shot from the rear of the craft and it leapt forward, rising rapidly to lose itself in the night sky. The incident was duly recorded in the ship's log, and prompt- ly forgotten except by those who saw it.

The ob- ject was described as ellipsoidal, whitish, and having sharply- outlined edges. La Paz determined that the object was not less than 20 nor more than 30 miles from his viewing point; that it was 160 feet long and 65 feet thick, if seen at minimum distance, or 245 feet long and 100 feet thick if at maximum. He also observed that the object moved with a wobble, no sound, and left no exhaust or vapor trail. (Life magazine, 4/7/52; Proceedings of the Symposium On UFOs, Committee On Science and Astronautics, U.S. House of Representatives, 7/29/68) * Topographer Jose C. Higgins was working at a location west of the Goio-Bang Colony in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, on the 23rd, when he witnessed the landing of a circular ob- ject in an open field about 150 feet from where he stood. The workers accompanying him, all countrymen, became fright- ened and ran. He said the craft was about 150 feet wide, not including the edges, which were about three feet in width, and the whole object was about 15 feet high. Higgins walked toward the machine just as a door located on the underside of the craft opened, and three occupants came out. They were enclosed in a kind of transparent suit which enveloped their bodies completely, head and all, and inflated like a rubber bag full of compressed air. On their backs was a metal box that seemed to be a part of the suit. Their eyes were large and round, and without eyebrows. They had no beards, and their heads were large and round and almost hairless. The length of their legs was greater in proportion to their bodies than those of a normal being, and their height was about seven feet tall, about a foot taller than Higgins. After about 30 minutes and a careful examination of the surroundings, the occupants got back into their ship which took off with a whistling sound. \"I will never know if they were men or women,\" Higgins said later when he related his story to the press. It was first published on August 8, 1947, in Diario Da Tarde and Correio Do Noroeste, in Bauru, in the state of Sao Paulo. There are two important points to consider in the evalua- tion of the above incident. The Kenneth Arnold sighting of June 1947 received little if any attention in Brazil and, a sketch of the craft seen by Higgins was published in the magazine O Cruzeiro and seems to indicate that it is of the Saturn-shape type or the double washbowl type, neither of which had been established through evaluation and compilation of data at that time. Higgins apparently described something which was to become common to UFO researchers years later. (The A.P.R.O. Bulletin, May 1961) July 1952 • At 9:12 p.m. on the 14th, a Pan American DC-4 approached Norfolk, Virginia on its way to Miami, Florida. At the controls was First Officer W.B. Nash. Second Officer W.H. Fortenberry was acting as copilot. Both men had been flying for more than 10 years, with thousands of hours in airliner cockpits. Cruising at 8000 feet, the DC-4 was a few miles from Newport News when a red glow appeared ahead. The pilots saw six huge, disc-shaped machines racing toward them, but at a lower altitude. The discs, which were flying in the flat position, had a brilliant orange glow like red-hot metal. As the formation approached, in echelon, the leader sud- denly slowed, then flipped up on edge. As if on signal, the five other discs also flipped up edgewise. Almost reversing its course, the leading machine flipped back to the horizon- tal and streaked off to the west. Following through, the others also swiftly changed their direction, then again lined up behind the leader. A second later two more discs shot out from under the DC-4. As they increased their speed to overtake the formation, the pilots saw their color suddenly brighten.

The pilots estimated the size of the discs to be 100 feet in diameter and 15 feet thick. Their estimated speed, 12,000 mph. (Flying Saucers From Outer Space by Major Donald Keyhoe) • On the 30th, Robert L. Farnsworth, president of the U.S. Rocket Society, urged the nation's top defense officials to restrain the Armed Forces from shooting at flying discs. Farns- worth said hostile action might alienate mankind from \"be- ings of far superior powers.\" He said there were unconfirmed rumors that the Armed Forces had been ordered to shoot at any unidentified object in the sky. Farnsworth warned against such tactics in a telegram to President Truman, Secretary of Defense Robert Lovett, Army Secretary Frank Pace Jr., and Navy Secretary Dan Kimball. His telegram said: \"I respect- fully suggest that no offensive action be taken against objects reported as unidentified which have been sighted over our nation. Should they be extraterrestrial, such action might result in the gravest consequences, as well as possibly alienating us from beings of far superior powers. Friendly contact should be sought as long as possible.\" (The News, San Francisco, CA, 7/30/52) July 1957 • Soviet anti-aircraft batteries on the Kuril Islands, north of Japan, opened fire on a large group of UFOs on the 24th. Although all Soviet anti-aircraft batteries on the Islands were in action, no hits were reported. The objects were luminous and moved very fast. We, too, have fired on UFOs. About ten o'clock one morning, a radar site near a fighter base picked up a UFO doing 700 mph. The object then slowed to 100 mph, and two F-86s were scrambled to intercept. Even- tually one F-86 closed on the UFO at about 3000 feet altitude. The object began to accelerate away but the pilot still managed to get within 500 yards of the target for a short period of time. It was definitely disc-shaped. As the pilot pushed the F-86 at top speed, the disc began to pull away. When the range reached 1000 yards, the pilot armed his guns and fired in an attempt to down the object. He failed, and the UFO pulled away rapidly, vanishing in the distance. (Introductory Space Science, Volume U, Department of Physics, United States Air Force Academy) July 1967 • The 18th was an ordinary day at the Soviet Astronomical Station near Kazan, on the Volga River. As the twilight deepened, two of the staff astronomers began mak- ing routine observations. Suddenly a huge flying object ap- peared, moving swiftly across the sky. As it passed above the observatory its orange glow made it easily visible in the dusk. It was an amazing sight, an enormous crescent-shaped craft. The horns of the crescent were pointed backward, emitting jetlike exhausts. Flying at incredible speed, the gigantic ship was out of sight within seconds. The two astronomers were shaken by the experience. At first they made no report, afraid no one would believe them. But confirmation of the giant ship soon came from other astronomers. In February 1968 the in- cident was confirmed at Moscow in an officially sanctioned statement. The most startling disclosures were the calcula- tions by the Kazan astronomers. The diameter of the ship was between 1640 and 1840 feet. The speed was approximately 11,160 mph. (Aliens From Space ...The Real Story of UFOs by Major Donald Keyhoe) July 1972 • On a clear but dark summer evening Mrs. Hilda McAfee and her elderly mother were on their way home by car from Las Cruces, New Mexico, to Deming. Interstate 10 was relatively devoid of traffic. About 23 miles east of Dem- ing the evening was disrupted by a beam of blue light directed at them from what seemed to be a short distance straight ahead, emanating from the same lane in which they were driv- ing. The light was huge and blinding and Mrs. McAfee prepared to swerve around an object on the ground just ahead. As she pulled around the object, the women were within view- ing distance of two beings bathed in a brilliant blue light, but only gathered a quick glance at them. They appeared to be of average height and rather stocky. They were clad in pale blue, bulky quilted coveralls. Mrs. McAfee's mother noted that they were wearing wide belts, which matched the coveralls and gloves. Mrs. McAfee said they were wearing dark boots which reached the mid-calf. Both agreed that the beings were iden- tically dressed and wore helmets similar in appearance to those worn by motorcyclists, with a dark-colored window which concealed the facial features. The figures appeared rigid and not aware of, or if so, unconcerned about, the presence of the two women. One had his back turned to the women and seemed to be working on something connected with the ob- ject located above them, while the other was turned sideways, facing him. Both were standing flat on the pavement, either beside or underneath the presumed object, and the blue light shone down on them from a point somewhere above. At the same time the beam of light which had been focused on the two women was still glaring at them and followed the car as it drove around the beings and object. The entire object was described as being obscure and no sound was heard. It was vaguely discerned as about the size of a truck and sitting off the ground. Mrs. McAfee said she wasn't certain but that they may have passed partially under the object in their attempt to avoid hitting it. Following their -encounter both women suffered a burning, aching pain in their chest and arms, and even their bones seemed to hurt. Both ladies thought the pain was caused by the light which was so brilliant it lit up the floor of the car and was much brighter than daylight. (The A.P.R.O. Bulletin, December 1975) • On the 10th, a South African Airways flight captain radioed the Durban, South Africa Airport control tower that a strange object was flying close to his Boeing 727 airliner. Flight Cap- tain Chester Chandler, 36, said: \"As we were descending toward the airport at 9:50 p.m., going about 300 miles per hour, this bright object flew close to us and kept pace with MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 291 July 1992"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"us right outside our cabin, a few hundred yards away. When we got down to about 9000 feet, it veered off suddenly, to the southwest, at terrific speed. My senior flight officer, Graham Smith and our flight engineer, G.

(National Enquirer, October 15, 1972) FUND FOR UFO RESEARCH Quarterly Report January - March 1992 T he major event during this quarter was a conference co-sponsored by the Fund and the Center for UFO Studies to discuss the reported crash of a UFO on the Plains of San Agustin in New Mexico in early July 1947. The conference was held February 14-15 in Chicago. The purpose of the meeting was to lay out all of the evidence supporting such an event, as well as to examine the contention of some in- vestigators that the event either didn't occur at that location, or didn't occur at all. A report on both sides of the issue will be published by CUFOS and the Fund in June. The Fund's Executive Committee received and approved three grant proposals for continued investigation into govern- ment involvement in UFOs in 1947. The first was from Timothy Cooper, a private investigator in California, who pro- posed to conduct research into the reported landing of an unidentified space craft on or near the White Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico in July 1947. The estimated costs for the project are $560. The second was a proposal submitted by Michael Swords and David Ford to conduct research into personnel stationed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base during the 1947-1948 period, in an effort to locate people who may have been in- volved in receiving the wreckage from the Roswell event. The proposal would involve utilizing the service of a \"skip-tracer\" (a finder of missing persons) and a genealogist. The estimated costs for the project are $500. The Executive Committee also approved a request from Stanton Friedman for $1,000 to support telephone expenses related to his continuing research into the Roswell case through 1992. Funding for these and other proposals was made possible by those who responded to our most recent request for sup- port to continue research into the Roswell UFO crash case. Those who contributed $50 or more to the effort received the new videotape, \"Recollections of Roswell (Part 2),\" a 105-minute presentation consisting of interviews with 28 witnesses. The fund-raising appeal raised more than $10,000 in donations. Partly as a result of this generous support, the Fund was able to donate copies of all of its publications to the Interna- tional UFO Museum recently opened in Roswell, New Mex- ico. We're pleased to report that the Fund is a Sponsor/Foun- ding Member of the museum, whose activities we support whole-heartedly. Also during this period, the Fund recognized outstanding journalism in 1991 through the Donald Keyhoe Journalism Award competition. This year's winners included: • Cindy Horswell for her follow-up article on the Cash- Landrum case, published in the Houston Chronicle; • Linda Moulton Howe for her documentary broadcast on the Fox Network, \"UFO Report: Sightings\"; and • Cathy Wogan, for her article on a college UFO Studies class, in the Defiance (OH) CrescentNews. The three winners shared a $2,000 cash award. The com- petition was open to all journalists employed by a newspaper, magazine, television or radio station whose article or story on some aspect of the UFO phenomenon was published or broadcast during the 1991 calendar year. The Fund also distributed a summary of UFO activities in 1991, entitled \"UFO Year in Review,\" to our expanding list of media contacts. We received responses from a number of outlets, including the Wall Street Journal and Omni magazine (which is preparing several articles about the Fund, including one about the Keyhoe Journalism Award competition).

Learner. The sighting occurred as the witness drove south on county road 450E about 250 feet south of county road 600N. The night was clear and what appeared to be half a dozen meteors were observed prior to the sighting. The object appeared and came toward the young man's car. He said that he had to cover his eyes with his hands, slow the car and take evasive maneuvers. He was aware of a buzzing sound coming from his radio so he \"popped\" the tape out of the tape deck. The sound con- tinued. The \"roundish\" oval object passed over his car at an elevation of less than 10 feet. He said that he took his hands from his eyes and looked over his shoulder as he hit the gas pedal. The object was hovering 35-40 feet off the road, in a field. He pushed hard on the gas pedal and drove away without looking back until he had driven a mile. The object could not be seen and the buzzing sound coming from the radio was gone. The witness estimated that the duration of the event was about 45 seconds. He said the object had two lights on it. They were described as being 4-sided and yellowish/orange in color. Log #04301992C: April 14, 1991, Durant, OK, 10:30 p.m.; investigator Richard D. Seifried, Norman, OK. A young woman who lives with her mother and 10-year-old brother, was in her mother's bedroom about 10:30 p.m., rocking her infant son to sleep. She noticed a red light coming through the curtained window. She hurried out to where her mother was and said, \"What was that?\" The mother was up and clos- ing the blinds because she did not want to know what it was. The young woman went outside to get a better look. There were two objects: one was a \"fireball\" about 18 inches across; it had no definite shape but \"swished\" rapidly along the southern sky, close to the trailer home. Then it \"swooshed\" off to the NW at an upward angle and disappeared. The sec- ond object was very large. It moved slowly along the road- way and then changed course, moved over an adjacent small field and stopped. The object was silver in color with a \"nip- ple\" on top with a red light and antenna. The witness said that there were windows alongside the \"nipple\" and they were square or rectangular. In the middle was a line of blue lights, and a line of red lights at the bottom. The bottom was flat, but a long, likely round, segment protruded below the main hull. This area opened up part way and a white light shot down to the ground. It must have been at an angle because it almost touched the witness. The light seemed to narrow as it came down so that the bottom was smaller than the top. She was frightened, extremely happy and crying. She began jumping and for some reason jumped two jumps to the left. The object changed and it, too, seemed to respond by jerk- ing two \"steps\" to her left. She thought this was wonderful so she jumped two steps to the right and the object responded by moving to the right. This was repeated several times so there was some sort of intelligent contact made. The light went back up into the object and her 10-year-old brother joined her in the yard. She said the light did not go out, but became shorter as it retreated into the object. Log 0101591C: July 1, 1991: 12:00 noon event in Troy, Ohio (Miami County); investigator Franklin B. Reams. A father and his 12-year-old daughter were riding a three-wheeler in a field on their property four miles NE of Troy, Ohio. It was a perfectly clear day and they had been riding a figure eight course for approximately one hour. For no known reason the man made a left turn on the track instead of turning right. As they turned to the west, they saw a large, bright, silvery object 15-20 degrees above the horizon. The object was pen- cil or cigar-shaped and approximately 1/2 to 1 mile away. The witnesses observed a lot of airline traffic in the area, since they are only 12 miles northeast of Dayton Cox Airport. They described the object as four times the length and twice the width of an airliner. They knew immediately that it was ah unusual object. There was no tail,.wings or windows. There were two darker or gray areas on an otherwise smooth shiny surface. It made no sound and if there was any motion, it was very slowly to the south. After sitting and watching the object for a few seconds, they decided to go to the house and get their video camera. The man drove the three-wheeler at idle speed while the daughter watched the object. After hav- ing driven 150 feet the girl said the object disappeared. The man looked all over the sky and was amazed that something that large was gone in an instant. The girl said there was a \"green flash\" and the object was gone. The morning after the sighting, a flight of five green military helicopters came out of the west over the area where the object had been and then right over the man's house. The witnesses had never seen a formation of five helicopters in their area, ever. Log #052792C: Feb. 9, 1992, 9:30 p.m. event eight miles south of Rapid City, SD on Hwy. 79; investigated by Davina Ryszka and Zack Harrison. A family of three (father, mother, teenage daughter) were heading toward Hermosa, SD when they sighted an object they thought was an airliner. Sudden- ly they realized that the object was too large, too slow, and too low to the ground to be an airliner. The man pulled the car to the side of the road, shut off the engine and got out of the car to watch. The woman and daughter stayed in the car but had the windows down. The three witnesses believed the object to be 2,000 feet from them and about 1,000 feet from the ground. There were bright lights along the bottom that were so bright it blocked out the definite shape, and they could not look directly at the object. They also noticed there Continued on page 21 MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 291 July 1992"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"LETTERS UFOs - the Religious Dimension ... As mentioned previously, no other article in recent memory has drawn more reader response, both pro and con, than John White's \"Aliens Among Us — A UFO Conspiracy Hypothesis in a Religious Mode,\" which appeared in the February 1992 issue. Space prohibits us publishing each and every letter received, but the following sample is more or less typical. George D. Fawcett, director of public relations for MUFON of North Carolina, Inc., wrote to say that White's article \"was one of the finest I've ever read in the pages of our Journal. Congratulations are in order! \"This hypothesis by White primarily covers one side of the coin. It contains not only proper bibliographical sketches and footnotes, but more importantly hits the nail on the head in reporting many of the profound spiritual implications I've found to be true in my own investigations and research of UFOs and their occupants over the past almost five decades.\" Eric Lightsey, vice president of the Houston UFO Network, Inc., said \"I must take exception to your review of John White's article. To consider Satan's existence and influence on this planet as 'hypothetical' could be dangerously naive. The Demon oppression and possession phenomenon is just as real as the UFO phenomenon. \"White makes some excellent points. His article may receive as lot of flak because many researchers associated with the UFO field of study attach much ill-conceived baggage to the concept of the Devil, demons and Lucifer/Satan. Some re- searchers either think these entities do not exist or are not a problem, or that they have nothing to do with the study of UFOs. I disagree. There are many reports of UFO occupants exhibiting the same skills or abilities which parallel other reports of phenomena attributed to demonic entities, such as dematerialization, levitation, psychic ability, sadistic treatment of humans, etc. If it ultimately turns out that some UFO oc- cupants (or the ultimate powers that control them) are somehow related to certain powers of darkness and evil that have in- terfered with and deceived mankind for millenia, then many ufologists may be caught with egg on their faces for summarily having denounced such a possibility. \"I'm not saying that all UFO occupants are really demons, or that demons are really UFO aliens, but I firmly believe that there is a connection. If people can stop throwing out all of the data that is uncomfortable or does not fit within their narrow-minded 'reality envelope,' then they just might find the answer to the UFO enigma, and maybe even the answer as to why all this is happening.\" M y brief comments about a hypothetical Satan were not a review of White's article as such. They were meant to address the problem of resolving one mystery — the UFO and abductions — by reference to another — the arguable, and at any rate unproven, existence of a demonic entity known as Lucifer. Interestingly, the Latin word lucifer from which the Prince of Light gets his name refers to Venus as the morning star and literally means \"light-bringing.\" No evil or negative connotation, of course, was originally attached. The same situa- tion applies to the Greek daimon, from whence our demon. Originally, the word referred to an attendant or guiding spirit. Ditto for genius, also Latin, which referred to a tutelary spirit, similar to a Guardian Angel. The Arabs refer to same as a jinn, which we recognize as a genie. In general, genius is still thought of as good, whereas genies are not, at least probably not in a Christian fundamentalist sense. The early Gnostics and Manicheans also had somewhat up- side down ideas as to what was good and bad in terms of in- visible agencies. So how did these original meanings and con- notations get flip-flopped over the course of centuries? (For an interesting fictional treatment of the subject, see Arthur C. Clarke's Childhood's End.) And if we're going to investigate UFOs in a religious light, which religious light do we use: Bud- dhism, Islam, Christianity? Contemporary Christianity itself is divided into numerous interpretations of the Old and New Testa- ment, based on just such nuances of each and every word as those I've outlined above. Which one of those do we go by — White's, mine or yours? It was this vast philosophical problem of fundamental agreement on basic terms, or rather the lack of same, that I was referring to in my \"review\" of White's article. A view similar to that of Fawcett and Lightsey was also ex- pressed by Daniel Eden of Jacksonville, Arkansas. \"Let me urge all ufologists, particularly the younger ones,\" he writes, \"to take White's comments very seriously. A few years ago I would have given short shrift to the idea of an intrinsically evil force active in ufology. However, his observations, along with similar ones by John Keel, Gordon Creighton, Ann Druffel, Don Worley and many others may, in fact, represent a tremendously im- portant aspect of the UFO field. \"I myself have come under some sort of powerful 'negative influences' that seem designed to lead me to self destruction. One dear woman, who claims to have the Biblical gift of 'dis- cerning spirits,' has even bluntly told me that I am currently being attacked by a classical 'demon.' \"While I don't feel that her interpretation is necessarily the only one possible, I certainly have experienced a number of psychological, physiological and possibly paranormal forces that seem intrinsically negative in nature. A number of classical fortean phenomena, seemingly unrelated to UFOs, have also intruded most forcefully into my previous 'ivory tower' research. \"In fact, that ivory tower of emotional indifference to the various phenomena that I have researched over the years has begun to crumble like Edgar Allan Poe's House of Usher. I find myself trying to recall Robert J. Durant's deep thought: 'Are we not all, researchers and abductees alike, victims?\" Address additional comments to ...

In the recent article, \"Return to Roswell\" by Anne MacFie, there are a few areas that need to be clarified. Glenn Dennis, after his last meeting with the nurse in Roswell in July 1947 wrote to her once or twice. The last letter he sent was returned marked, \"Deceased.\" Talking to other nurses at the base, he was told that she had been killed in an aircraft accident in England shortly after her transfer there. In our investigation, we could find no evidence of that ac- cident. We checked the London Times and The New York Times index, finding no reference to an aircraft accident in Great Britain or Europe in which Army nurses had been kill- ed. The National Transportation and Safety Board's records do not cover military accidents that far back, and the Army records we've searched list no training accidents killing five nurses. In other words, we have not been able to confirm the story that had been given to Dennis. In discussing this with him, we learned that his nurse had been very devout and had, in fact, talked of becoming a nun. We began to speculate, wondering if the Army, in it's attempt to cover up, might have given the nurse the option to get out of the Army on the condition she would enter a convent. Eigh- teen months ago we began a quiet effort to find out if that might have been the case. With no documentation about the aircraft accident, it made some sense. Unlike Ms. MacFie suggested, we had been trying to follow that lead ... quietly. In an investigation of this nature, we cer- tainly didn't want to telegraph our moves. Often, the way to learn something is to keep quiet, ask questions, and see what happens. Once too much is learned about the investigation, the doors are closed. Unfortunately, doors that had been opened, are now shut. The important thing to remember here is that Glenn Den- nis is not changing his story, as it would appear at first blush. The information about the nurse entering the convent is speculation, pure and simple. The story is that she was killed in a plane crash in late 1947. The information about the convent came about as we tried to learn the truth. This really isn't much of a discrepancy, but those who don't know the whole story, those in the skeptical community, could take the information from the article and use it as proof that Dennis was changing his tune. If they understand how the new information was developed and that it is speculation, not by Dennis but by Don Schmitt and me, then we have not ac- cidentally undermined Dennis' credibility. Thank you for the opportunity to set the record straight. I hope this will answer a few of the questions that might have been raised. - Kevin D. Handle Cedar Rapids, IA Dear Editor: While \"Return to Roswell\" (April 1992) remains fresh in the mind, I would like to comment on one feature of Ms. MacFie's interview. A reliable witness viewed the physical remains of some humanlike creatures, yet only a short paragraph or so was devoted to describing what she saw. What about skin, hair, the feet? Was there a tongue? What about internal organs? When I was interviewed by a MUFON representative con- cerning my recent UFO sighting, he made fully inquiry of every aspect relative to my observation. But here we have what could be an unusually important subject - life from outer space - devoted largely to a long story about bickering. - James J. Smith Brockport, NY Dear Editor: I am not a bit surprised to learn, from Dan Wright's \"Ab- ductions: Our Dirty Secret,\" that MUFON possesses pretty well nothing on the vital matter of abductions. I'd say that situation is normal! Neither Donald Keyhoe nor anybody else at NICAP — so far as I was able to see, being a NICAP member myself — would accept any evidence whatsoever for alien critters. And the Brazilian text of the story of Antonio Villas Boas had lain for months in the files of Flying Saucers Review, our then editor, Waveney Girvan, having refused to take it seriously or give it any thought. It was I who translated it into English. When Charles Bowen took over (Girvan having developed a fulminating cancer and died in just a few days — just like so many other UFO researchers), I was able to persuade him to publish it in FSR Volume XI, No. 1, January/February 1965. \"History\" has of course been \"re-written\" since then, and neither FSR nor I had anything else to do with the affair of Antonio Villas Boas. — Gordon Creighton Editor, FSR CASE LOG, Continued were three parallel, separate, long, narrow, pink colored lights that ran the length of the object, estimating the distance be- tween each pink line at 10 feet. The man estimated that the object was three stories tall and 100 feet in length. They watched the silent object until it moved slowly from west to east ... like a hot air balloon. It crossed Hwy. 79, in front of them. The witnesses are very reluctant to talk about the experience because it disturbed them greatly.

Webb August 1992 • Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Venus (magnitude -3.9) and Jupiter (-1.7), the two brightest planets, narrow the gap between each other this month. But both are very low in the W after sunset, setting within 45 minutes and an hour of the Sun, respectively, in mid- August. Jupiter is 5° to the upper left of Venus on the 17th. The gap narrows at the rate of 1° per day until conjunction on the 22nd. Look for the pair above an unobstructed W horizon half an hour after sunset. Saturn, in Capricornus, is opposite the Sun on August 7. Shining then at magnitude 0.2, the ringed planet rises in the ESE at sunset and moves across the southern sky dur- ing the night. The full moon lies nearby on the 12th. • Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars (0.7), in Taurus between the Pleiades and Aldebaran, rises in the NE about 12:30 AM and stands high in the ESE at dawn. On the llth the ruddy planet passes 5° above orange Aldebaran. Compare their colors. Their brightnesses are nearly the same this month. Saturn is low in the WSW at dawn. • Meteor Shower: Last year the Perseid meteors surprised observers in Japan and Arizona with intense displays of 450 and 120 per hour, respectively. Since normal hourly rates average around 50 or so at maximum, some speculate that the shower's parent comet, Swift-Tuttle, may be approaching Earth's vicinity. Unfortunately, a full moon this year will severely wash out many of the Perseids on the peak morning of August 12. Try looking for the meteors on the previous two mornings during a \"window\" between moonset and the start of morning twilight. Moon Phases: First quarter — August 5 Full moon — August 13 Last quarter — August 21 New Moon — August 27 C O 3 The Stars: August evenings bring the Summer Triangle high overhead. Just to the W of the bright stellar trio lie the dim sprawl- ing constellations of Hercules and Ophiuchus! Look for the Keystone, the four-sided waist of the upside-down kneel- ing Hercules. Ophiuchus (the Serpent Bearer) is shaped like an Arab tent and is located S of the prior constellation. To the E of the Triangle, find another upside-down figure, the Flying Horse Pegasus. (The Great Square marks its body.) The bright yellowish \"star\" in otherwise faint Capricor- nus the Sea Goat (shaped like a diaper or bikini) is the planet Saturn. Its tilted ring system can be perceived even in high- powered binoculars. The Bennewitz Affair: An Update In the February 1992 issue of the Journal we an- nounced the publication of a new book by William Moore: The Scientist, the Government and UFOs: Personal Recollections of the Paul Bennewitz Affair. Several of our members have since called or written to complain that they sent Mr. Moore a check but have yet to see the book or receive even a letter of explanation. MUFON greatly regrets any inconvenience this premature and unfortunate announcement may have caused our members. We have since been in contact with Mr. Moore, who cites personal financial problems for the delay, but advises that the book will be published and that pre-publication orders will be filled. We can only hope this will indeed prove to be the case. In the meantime, MUFON and the Journal have initiated a new policy aimed at avoiding such confusion in the future. No announcement of a forthcoming book to be published by an in- dividual will appear in the Journal until the editors have in hand a hard copy of the adver- tized work. Please send such copies and any accompanying announcement to either Dennis Stacy, Box 12434, San Antonio, TX, 78212, or Walt Andrus, 103 Oldtowne Road, Seguin, TX, 78155-4099. Again, we apologize for any temporary in- convenience we may have caused our members or readers in this matter. — The Editor MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 291 July 1992"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"MESSAGE, Continued Abduction Study Conference On June 13-17, 1992 an Abduction Study Conference was held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, hosted by David E. Pritchard, Ph.D. and John E. Mack, M.D. and entirely independent of M.I.T., except for the facilities. At- tendance was limited to conferees and abductees by invita- tion only, therefore the conference was not listed in the Calen- dar of UFO Conferences in 1992 in the Journal. Very favorable publicity was received in newspapers across the country repor- ting the event. This was a follow-up conference to the first National Con- ference on Anomalous Experiences held at Temple Univer- sity on January 18-20, 1991, organized and hosted by David M. Jacobs, Ph.D. and Budd Hopkins. John F. Schuessler and Walter H. Andrus, Jr. represented MUFON at the very successful and productive first conference. Dan Wright, representing MUFON at M.I.T., made a ma- jor proposal to the conference which was well received and enacted upon by at least eleven of the major abductee resear- chers who have thousands of hours of audio tapes of their hypnosis sessions. Since MUFON has become the prime con- tributor to implementing Mr. Wright's plan, we have taken the liberty of publishing his presentation in the August issue of the Journal for all to review. We received such a favorable response to our invitation for volunteers with stenographic skills to transcribe audio-taped recordings of hypnotic regression sessions in the April 1992 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal, I am again making the same appeal for additional volunteers. The names of the people originally volunteering their skills have all been mailed to Dan Wright, since he will be coordinating this vitally important project. Your International Director will again serve as the collection point for volunteers to help \"solve our dirty secret.\" Crop Circles in U.K. Investigators and Researchers in England have reported that the first uniqued shaped crop circle configurations have started appearing in wheat and barley fields during the second week of June 1992. These are small circles with worm or curly- cue's emanating from the outside edges of the circle. We will be hearing more from the North American Circle group, head- ed by Michael M. Chorost, who will be in England from July 9 - August 19, in the joint effort of CCCS/NAC \"Pro- ject Argus.\" Stay tuned. MUFON was proud to be able to contribute $2,500 toward financial support for the project. MUFON UFO Journal The number of Journals mailed in January 1992 was 3,307, whereas the quantity in June had increased substantially to 3,768, a growth of 461 copies. Comparing June 1991 to June 1992, there was an increase of 701 copies. 3,950 copies of the June 1992 issue were printed to cover new memberships for the month. With the greater popularity of UFOs in the electronic and printed media, we are looking forward to the next milestone of 4,000 subscribers. International UFO Conference in U.K. The Independent UFO Network in England presents \"ET or Not ET, Is that the Question?\" at their International UFO Conference which will take place the weekend of August 15 and 16, 1992 at the Central Library Theater, Sheffield, South Yorkshire. An impressive line-up of speakers will include: William L. Moore, Jenny Randies, Graham Allen, Dr. John Shaw, Robert France, Ralph Noyes, Albert Budden and Kevin McClure.

Hosted by New Mexico- MUFON, Teresa Brito-Asenap and her committee are to be congratulated and given accolades not only for their terrific job, but by making everyone welcome to the \"Land of En- chantment.\" For those of you who were unable to personally attend and enjoy the symposium, the published symposium proceedings (231 pages) are now available from MUFON in Seguin, Texas for $20 plus $1.50 for postage and handling in U.S. funds. (Foreign orders should be made by international postal money order.) We regret that published papers are not included for Budd Hopkins, due to kidney surgery, and Philippe Piet van Putten because of mail delay problems from Brazil. On the positive side, an additional published paper by Pavel Popovich, President of the UFO Centre in Moscow, Russia titled \"Ufology in the Commonwealth of Independent States: Organizational Problems\" is included. Annual MUFON Award Linda Moulton Howe was the recipient of the prestigious 1991-1992 MUFON award plaque and monetary prize of $500, honoring the person deemed most instrumental in advancing the science of ufology by her colleagues through a ballot enclosed with the May 1992 issue of the Journal. The award was presented in Albuquerque on July llth. Ms. Howe re- ceived twice as many votes as the nearest contender. She of- fered her sincere thanks to the many people who expressed their confidence in her dedicated work and accomplishments. The MUFON Board of Directors appreciated the very substan- tial number of members who cast their ballots attesting to the significance of the award. New Officers For MUFON to continue to be the world leader in Ufology it is essential that enthusiastic and effective leadership be a prime requisite of our grassroots organizational structure. Elaine Douglass (Washington, DC) has been appointed State Director for the District of Columbia, replacing David W. Schwartzman, Ph.D. Dr. Schwartzman, a member since 1974, will continue to serve as a Consultant in Geo Chemistry. Miss Douglass has demonstrated the motivational attributes to inspire our members in the nation's capital. John C. Kasher, Ph.D. (Omaha, NE) was promoted from Assistant to State Director for Nebraska replacing Stephen Johnson. Davina M. Ryszka, State Director for South Dakota, has selected two new State Section Directors as another positive step in building her state investigative team. They are Jeff W. Goodrich (Rapid City, SD) for Meade and Pennington Counties and Donald C. Nelson, Ph.D. (Custer, SD) for Custer County. Dr. Nelson was previously made a Consul- tant in Horticulture. The following people were appointed State Section Directors by their respective State Directors: Gerald D. Fossett (Section, AL) for De Kalb and Jackson Counties; Walter A. Fydryck (Chicago, IL) for Cook and Lake Coun- ties: Deborah M. Smith (Ormond Beach, FL) for Volusia County; Roland B. Lee (Midland, TX) for Midland, Ector and Andrews Counties; Beth K.

MUFONET-BBS The interest and popularity in the computer MUFONET- BBS operated by John Komar in Memphis, TN was dramat- ically recognized on June 2, 1992 when the automatic call- ing recorder marked 10,000 calls to the network since its founding just a few years ago. MUFONET-BBS is a com- puter network operated for and by MUFON members. John Komar, system operator and Tennessee State Director, has done an outstanding job managing and operating the network.
