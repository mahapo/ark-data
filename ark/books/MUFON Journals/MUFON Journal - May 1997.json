Hamilton Field Investigator for MUFON I arch 13th started like any other day. I had an incoming message in my e-mail box. The message was from Joe Trainor in the U.K. He had been retreiv- ing messages from a man named Steve who lives in Awahatukee, Arizona just south of Phoenix and behind South Mountain. Steve reported that starting on March 10th, he and his family had noticed and were videotaping strange orange lights over the Gila River Indian Reservation. After I made contact with Steve and obtained directions to his house I met with Tom King according to a prior arrangement and asked him to join me that night. When we arrived at Steve's house we saw at least a dozen of Steve's neighbors traipsing in and out of the house, Steve met us cordially at the door and introduced us to his wife and children. The first words after that were \"you're too late, they were here and gone again.\" He proceeded to show us video segments he had taken that night and from previous nights. We asked him to show us his observation point which was a second-floor balcony off the master bed- room facing south. All of us went up the stairway and out to the balcony. Steve had reported that he had been seeing the lights between 9 and 10 P.M. That night we went up to the balcony at about 9:30 P.M. Steve and his neighbors pointed to the southwest in the direction of the Estrella Mountains on the reservation where they had most of their sightings, Shortly before 10 P.M. one of these brilliant lights just turned on. Within a minute we saw six globes or orbs of yellow- orange lights appearing near and in front of the Estrellas. They were extremely bright and formed a straight line at a slight slant. The light on the left of the formation was divided into two parts (or orbs). I personally observed these lights through a Celestron 500mm spotting scope. My videocam bat- tery failed, but Tom King managed to tape over four minutes as we watched these orbs gradually extinguish one by one in the re- verse sequence which was from right to left. Little did we know at that time that a pri- mary object was sighted earlier that evening from various cities in the state, that, accord- ing to the time sequence of the sightings, moved from north to south down the state. A man in Paulden, Arizona, called the Daily Courier and said he saw five dia- mond-shaped objects with wispy tails. That was around 8 P.M. Shortly after, calls poured into the National UFO Reporting Center from Prescott, Prescott Valley, and Dewey before reaching the Phoenix metro- politan area around 8:23 P.M. that night. The witnesses described the object as \"huge,\" sporting five or six lights in a trian- gular formation and traveling at \"blimp speed\" according to several witnesses. This triangular formation was seen to accelerate and slow to a hover on several occasions and passed very low over the cities of Scottsdale, Tempe, and Chandler where wit- nesses observed some structure to the trian- gular object. Around 8:45 P.M. the object was sighted in the Tucson area. One of the lights attached to the front of the object would detach from the object and fly off and return. Some mysterious military source sug- gested that the strange lights over Phoenix were explained as an anti-aircraft experi- ment in a military operating area over 50 miles from Phoenix. This experiment in- volved flares descending on parachutes. We are not sure how the flare story got started, but two witnesses we interviewed were de- molition experts for the military and they stated that what they saw were not flares. As we started collecting reports as they poured into MUFON Arizona field investi- gators, we learned that the \"orb\" lights were seen as early as March 7th. One of our MU- FON members, Herb Moran, reported he had a sighting between 9:10 P.M. and 9:30 P.M. on March 7th on a road which runs parallel to the Goodyear Airport. He ob- served at some distance directly ahead of him a large light the color of an amber sodium vapor lamp but with the intensity of landing lights on a heavy jet aircraft. The light was on a line of sight which would have placed it approximately five to eight miles south of the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station which is 45 miles west at 250 degrees from Phoenix Sky Harbor A man in Paulden, Arizona, called the Daily Courier and said he saw five dia- mond-shaped objects with wispy tails. Shortly after, calls poured into the National UFO Reporting Center from Prescott, Prescott Valley, and Dewey before reaching the Phoenix met- ropolitan area.

May 1997 Number 349 Page 4 Airport. Puzzled by this light, different from any Herb had seen after 48 years as a pri- vate pilot and an aviation industry worker, he began to scan the sky just as the light blinked out. Unknown to Herb and the rest of us was the fact that a young man named Scott Montgomery was videotaping these strange lights in the same location and he and his wife came forth with some of their video on the Channel 10 local news after the reports of the March 13th sightings. At about 8:35 P.M. a resident of Phoenix was walking near 42nd Street and Ray Road when he glanced towards the northern skies and was surprised to see a group of lights in a triangular pattern. He estimated the num- ber of lights as between five and seven. At first, he thought this was a solid triangular object much like a flying wing. He was nearly underneath' the flight path which was from north to south. As he looked closely he saw relative movement between the lights as if moving toward and away from each other. The object(s) emitted no noise what- soever. As it flew ahead, the lights appeared to get dimmer and dimmer. Strangely, these lights would disappear one by one until all the lights disappeared. As it Hew above this witness, he could barely distinguish a trian- gular layout. Another witness, Bruce Gerboth, re- ported from Ahwatukee near the SE corner of South Mountain (a prominent mountain in Phoenix topped by television transmis- sion towers). He had gone for a walk into the park at about 7:15 P.M. He walked to the foot of the hills which are closely aligned with Elliot and 40th street. That night at about 8:30 he saw something in the night sky he had never seen before. Cruising at high altitude were five amber lights in a triangular formation. He had the feeling that the lights were connected to a single structure. He observed those lights until they disappeared over the Gila River Indian Reservation. This places the primary object in the vicinity of the secondary ob- jects that Tom and I viewed later. Bruce goes on to say that he stayed in the park un- til 9:30. As he walked home he observed seven bright amber lights (we could see six and others saw more depending on their un- obstructed view) appear in the west-south- west. They were in an almost diagonal line and appeared to slowly set behind the Estrella Mountains near the sailport at the south foot of the mountains. He felt these were the same lights he had observed ear- lier. Another witness reported seeing five lights in a V formation moving south along route 51 and a little to the east of it. They seemed to be moving in a straight line to- ward South Mountain which places them in"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL the position that Bruce saw them a little later. A nother man, named Kelley, and his wife witnessed the sighting from the west end of the valley in the city of Glendale. At about 8:15 P.M, they were driving north on 67th Avenue. Kelley's wife saw the lights first and called his attention to them. They saw a perfect V-shaped formation of seven lights, a lead light with three trailing lights on each side of the V formation. He pulled the car off of 67th and shut off his motor so that they could exit the car and watch the formation more closely. It was difficult for Kelley to determine whether they were watching one object or a flight of smaller objects. They watched the event for several minutes. Kelley and his wife are both ex- Air Force and were well acquainted with aircraft and their characteristics. There were no navigation lights visible and no engine sounds detectable. He \"guesstimated\" this V to be no greater than five thousand feet, and no less than two thousand feet in altitude. This accords well with other witnesses' esti- mates. He described the V as moving at \"blimp\" speed. As they continued to view the objects the third light back on the right broke formation and moved toward the lead light briefly. This is when they concluded that it wasn't a single large object. Kelley's is one of the reports that I have used to con- struct my four-event scenario that I will de- scribe in summing up. While they were watching, the formation began to turn to- ward the east and then faded out as if it were climbing into some overcast. Kelley had heard the so-called \"flare\" explanation and dismissed it. He also stated that he was a former skeptic. One of the triangles seemed to be ap- proaching Phoenix from the north on the eastern side and heading directly south to- ward South Mountain at around 8:30 P.M. This object returned at close to 10 P.M. that night and deployed \"orbs\" in the vicinity of the Estrella Mountains or appeared as an object in a wide configuration that from a distance of 25 miles had the appearance of an arc of ten lights spanning a mile across. The object moving southeast passed low over Scottsdale and was seen by a young woman, Ozma, and her friend in the mili- tary reserve, Willie. As the object de- scended to a low altitude it looked as if it were going to stop. Their description of the object as huge, three to four times the size of a Boeing 747, and silent, was consistent with other witnesses who had viewed the primary object. Just west of Ozma's position in Scottsdale, Pete Fournier was coming home from a Neighborhood Association meeting a little after 8 P.M., walking west on Edgemont from 42nd Street in Phoenix when he observed five bright lights to his right as he looked between the houses. They appeared to be over Squaw Peak. The five lights appeared to be in a single row and hovering. As he walked he determined that the lights were moving to the southeast. As he arrived at his house, he called out to his wife and grabbed binoculars. The V-shaped formation passed over to the west of his home. The unit of lights was not making a sound. He continued to watch this formation move to the southeast when the light on the eastern leg of the triangle shifted slightly out of formation. There was no noise from rotors. Peter was familiar with aircraft and was definite that these were not part of a typical aircraft and all the lights appeared bright white. There were no conventional red and green running lights and no strobe lights. This object crossed the approach and de- parture flight path of Phoenix Skyharbor Airport. Channel 15 local news reported that a pilot on takeoff from Skyharbor spot- ted the lights above him and called the tower operators to ask them if they picked up anything on radar above him. The tower operator reported that they had nothing on radar. Tom King has started the wheels rolling on attempting to get a record of tower communications or radar records for the night of the 13th. One woman in Chandler just southeast of Phoenix reported that she did not see the lights that night, but that her 9-year old daughter reported that a traveling beam of light had moved through her bedroom and through the birdcage in her bedroom. This woman had neighbors who had a very good view of the primary object as it passed over their heads at a very low altitude. These neighbors drew sketches of what they saw at between 8:50 P.M. and 9:10 P.M. The neighbor, Don, and his wife, Grace, could observe structure on the triangular ob- ject. Don and Grace both observed gray panels on the underside of this structure with seven orange lights on the forward sec- tion of the triangular structure. One of the orange lights detached and went out to the Their de- scription of the object as huge,three to four times the size of a Boeing 747, and silent, was consis- tent with other wit- nesses who had viewed the primary object.

May 1997 Number 349 Page 6 right and then returned and redocked with the primary object. Could this detached or- ange light be one of the \"orbs\" deployed into the environment and seen later? W e do not know, but other reports that have come in from California indicate that these orbs have been seen leaving and re-merging with some primary object or light. Both Don and Grace reported hearing no sound from the triangle. They also saw a brilliant white ball of light followed by a red glow trail behind the object. Witness Mike Fortson seems to have seen a different object that I identify with Event 1, the V-shaped formation of lights. Mike observed these from his Chandler home and was impressed by the sheer size of this object. He believes that what he saw was a massive singular object that had a translucent surface which passed between him and the moon. When it did so, he said, the moon turned from white to yellow. He could also make out a kind of \"distortion field\" around the object and between him and the lights that seemed to \"ripple\" like waves traveling through water. Another wit- ness named Tim Ley also noticed this ripple effect. The object Mike saw passed his posi- tion going south down Alma School Road around 8:30 P.M. A later witness, a truck driver named Bill Greiner gave one of the most impressive testimonies, but viewed a different event that I have labeled Event 4. He witnessed two orange lights for two hours while he was driving his truck south on Interstate 17 from Verde Valley to a cement/gravel plant near Luke AFB. When he arrived at his des- tination in the west valley, he witnessed three jets scramble from Luke to intercept the nearest of the two now seen hovering 1- 2 miles away to the southwest while the other object hung at a position in the north- west. He described the objects as looking like toy tops or hot-air balloons without the gondolas, glowing a yellow-orange from within and.engirdled with a pulsating red- glowing ring of light. As the jets ap- proached the near object, the object shot straight up and disappeared with the jets passing through the spot where the object had been hovering. A call to Luke AFB by Tom King received the answer that all jets had been bedded down for the night by 7 P.M. The witness has volunteered to take a lie-detector test as he said that despite the Air Force denials, he knows what he saw. A report received from Tucson's MU- FON Section Director, June Scherrer, re- veals that a witness saw a diamond forma- tion of slow-moving golden yellow lights at around 8:45 P.M. in Saddlebrook, north of Tucson and flying southward toward Tucson. It is difficult to determine whether the formation in Tucson was the same for- mation seen earlier over Phoenix. Shortly after these reports started coming in, I went on a local radio station and re- quested more witnesses to come forward and have been doing so every Saturday night since the March 13 sighting. There was an additional report that was forwarded from Tucson of a sighting on March 22 of a formation of thirty lights seen at 5 A.M. moving northward. Isolated reports have been coming in up to April 14th when a smaller version of the Phoenix sightings took place over the cities of Chandler and Coolidge. The sightings on March 13th were re- markable due to the wide range of sightings on that night, the sheer number of people calling in reports to local police and news stations, and the calls received by Peter Davenport of the National UFO Reporting Center, and the number of witnesses who recorded video images of their sighting. I have been able to discern in the Phoenix sightings four or five separate events. Event 1 is generally described as a large V-formation of six or seven lights. Event 2 is generally described as a huge, dark black triangle with structural details. Event 3 is generally described as intensely glowing spheres or orbs of golden-yellow light. Event 4 is the description given by Bill Greiner of the large orbs hovering near Luke AFB. There may have been more than four events on that night, but there are at least four definitive ones. Spokesmen from Luke AFB said: 1) They received no calls ftom residents about the strange lights on March 13. Peter Davenport reports that some of his callers obtained his hot line number by calling the desk out at Luke. 2) They report that they bedded the jets down at 7 P.M. on that night and generally do not fly jets at night. Witnesses have reported to me that they have seen jets fly out of Luke at night, and Bill Greiner stands by his testimony that he saw three jets sent out at 10 P.M. on March 13 on intercept of the UFOs he had under Continued on Page 14"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Netscape [HigherSource.org[ -Window Help ' ' ~| WhaCs New 1 I What': Cool' I Handbook | Net Seaich | Mel Dneclon> | Sotlwaie ! \"\"^v^rJi'^. 'i\":^'!*-! !'ss The Second Conning of Marshall Applewhite Dr. Barry H. Downing One of several mirror sites for the Hea- ven's Gate Web page. This one is at higher source, org/ T wo decades ago I published an article in the MUFON UFO Journal dealing with a religious cult called \"The Two\" headed by Marshall Applewhite and Bonnie Lu Trusdale Nettles. This man and woman had put together a UFO/Christian cult in which their task was to lead their followers to a higher state of consciousness, preparing for their exit from planet Earth to heaven. Then the cult disap- peared from the media screen, only to emerge with graphic force during Holy Week 1997. We have witnessed the Second Coming of Marshall Applewhite, who was the leader of the Rancho Santa Fe, California, cult that ended its life on earth with 39 sui- cides, including that of Applewhite. Applewhite's cult began as \"The Two,\" and ended as \"Heaven's Gate.\" suicide being the chosen means to pass through the gate. Missing was Bonnie Lu Trusdale Nettles, who had died in 1985. The fact that Ms. Nettles died in 1985 undoubtedly caused a revision in the origi- nal theology of the cult of \"The Two.\" for the original story was that Applewhite and Nettles were \"The Two\" prophets spoken of in Revelation 11:3, \"And I will grant my two witnesses power to prophesy for one thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.\" The prophecy was that The Two would prophesy together, and then die together. When Ms. Nettles died in 1985, while Applewhite lived on, I am sure some kind of theological revision was re- quired. Groups that prophesy the end of the world have always been adept at \"adjust- ing\" to a failed prophecy. Some modern forms of religion, such as the Jehovah's Witnesses, are an example of adjustment made to failed prophecy. Christianity as a whole, at the beginning, expected Jesus to return very soon, and when that did not happen, religious leaders by and large put the Second Coming off to an indefinite fu- ture. Conservative Protestants have always had millennial fever, and with the year 2000 approaching, we can expect that fever May 1997 Number 349 Page?"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Although the hi-tech UFO cult called Heaven's Gate seems strange to the world, its basic mes- sage—we are trying to im- prove our- selves morally, so that the God/Force will take us to heaven—is little different from tradi- tional Judeo- Christian faith. May 1997 Number 349 Pages to heighten. They will be looking for \"signs\" that the end is near. For the Heaven's Gate cult, the comet Hale-Bopp was the sign that it was time for them to leave Earth and join their UFO salvation in the sky. (Also, leader Applewhite may have figured his prophetic time was running out.) Likewise the Jewish faith, based on Malachi 4:5, had expected the Second Coming of Elijah, who had ascended into the sky in a chariot of fire (2 Kings 2:11). Ithough circumstances forced lewhite to revise his logo from \"The Two\" to \"Heaven's Gate,\" as I watch the film of the dead bodies in the suicide mansion, broadcast by CNN and all the net- works, the words from Revelation are inter- esting, for the beast is to to rise up and kill The Two, and then \"For three days and a half men from the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations gaze at their dead bod- ies and refuse to let them be placed in a tomb, and those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them and make merry and ex- change presents, because these two prophets had been a torment to those who dwell on the earth.\" (Rev. 11:9-10) Applewhite and other UFO cult leaders have also \"been a torment\" to the scientific study of UFOs of the type that MUFON has been carrying out for nearly three decades, The Heaven's Gate cult is similar to other cults, like those involving Jim Jones and David Koresh, in that all used the book of Revelation to justify their own position as a special chosen prophet, all had male leaders that expected some kind of \"end of the world\" crisis to come soon. When that end did not come as prophesied, then each leader pushed the cult into death, either through confrontation with authorities, as with David Koresh, or through suicide, as with Jones and Applewhite. The Heaven's Gate cult impacts MU- FON because this is a UFO cult. Religion has always been a \"wart\" on what MUFON hoped was a scientific UFO hog, as I ex- plained in my article \"The God Hypothesis\" (Journal, October 1988). Cults like that of Applewhite help discredit the scientific search for UFO truth, but the reli- gious dimension of UFOs will not go away. What we need to do is handle the reli- gious dimension of UFOs as scientifically and objectively as we do the \"hard core\" UFO information, not an easy task, but a necessary one. Cults like that of Applewhite can thrive because 1) we live in a culture in which we expect government leaders to lie regularly, and they do, and so when they make public statements about UFOs, they are not be- lieved (and shouldn't be). It is this conspir- acy world view that makes a program like \"The X-Files\" so believable. 2) UFO cults thrive in our culture because as the cover story of the March 24, 1997 issue of Time magazine (\"Does Heaven Exist?\") makes clear, people still hunger to know what hap- pens after we die. But traditional religious leaders, Jewish and Christian, by and large no longer deal with the issue of heaven, and life after death (except at funerals). When traditional religious leaders will not answer the question: What happens when we die?, then cult groups move in to fill the void. Although the hi-tech UFO cult called Heaven's Gate seems strange to the world, its basic message—we are trying to im- prove ourselves morally, so that the God/Force will take us to heaven—is little different from traditional Judeo-Christian faith, which believes in a Sky God that will save us. whether at Passover, or at Easter. This is what I believe. I believe UFOs are real, some kind of intelligent force not of this world. If they can abduct humans, evade military planes, and all the other things a scientific analysis of UFOs seem to indicate, then we are dealing with a very powerful force, one that can shape the de- velopment of human culture, as Jacques Vallee has stated so well in Dimensions. In any other generation, a force like this would have been called God. The religion issue will not soon go away from UFO studies.

I had been reading a few books on UFOs and found myself capti- vated by the subject—and also a little un- nerved by it. In an effort to find out more, I had decided to find others who were in- terested in UFOs and try to pick their brains. But I was somewhat hesitant when 1 walked into the meeting room. Everyone looked normal enough (whew!). Many of those present seemed to know each other already. Clearly there was a core commu- nity of believers here. But I was a stranger—and I thought that I might want to remain that way. I kept to myself. There were a number of displays of UFO photos and articles around the periph- ery of the room, so I pretended that I was an anthropologist in an exotic new village and I wandered around looking at things and getting a feel for this new environ- ment. On one low table against the back wall there was a framed picture of Betty and Barney Hill. \"A shrine,\" I thought to myself. On the table next to the podium at the front of the room there were a couple of busts of what I immediately recognized were aliens. \"Weird.\" Then the meeting began. I sat safely in the back of the room. While not exactly run according to Robert's Rules of Order, it was business-like and, to a pretend an- thropologist, fascinating. Someone talked about a recent sighting investigation they had just finished. Someone else gave a talk on the history of UFOs and science. There was normal group administrative business to be conducted. And then there was the time when those who had seen UFOs or had other types of alien encoun- ters could get up and tell their stories. Some people described sightings. One person described an abduction experience. Very fascinating. Very weird. Who are these people. I wondered. Four years later I had decided that they—that we—were basically sane, nor- mal people who had daily lives as mun- dane and as exciting as the next person. We had children, paid taxes, celebrated an- niversaries, struggled with jobs and fami- lies, shopped, changed the oil in the car, were active in the theater scene or in the environmental movement.... The local MUFON chapter seemed to consist of fairly bright, well-educated people, and I understood that this was the norm in UFO circles. But we also seemed unique in some ways: more attuned to developments in the world of science, more sensitive to governmental actions, more metaphysi- cally inclined. By this time I had become the historian for the state MUFON chapter and had re- ceived permission to write my doctoral dis- sertation on the UFO abduction phenome- non in society. I was also a minor assistant in North Carolina's sponsorship of the International MUFON Symposium in 1996. With the kind permission of Walt Andrus and the local symposium organiz- ers, I was able to circulate a survey at that conference in order to test some of my sub- jective observations about people in the UFO community. I found some of the re- sults rather surprising. [1] The average MUFON Symposium par- ticipant in 1996 was a married white male (83% of us were white; 68% of us, male) between 46 and 60 years of age who had a bachelor's degree (21% of us) and earned between $36-50 thousand per year (19%). By way of comparison, the average level of educational attainment nationally is a high school diploma and the median in- come for individuals with that degree is $30,000 a year. [2] Our typical MUFON conference-goer was a Protestant Christian (45% of us) who attended his church on major holidays and for other special occa- sions (as do 13% of us), but not on an oth- erwise regular basis. On survey questions designed to mea- sure social alienation the average confer- ence participant came out about normal— or even slightly more optimistic—when compared to the rest of the U.S. popula- tion. He was not sure that the condition of the average person is getting worse (50% of conference-goers thought it was getting worse, compared to 66% of respondents to the same question on a national survey), and he was only somewhat more inclined to think that officials have no interest in the average person's problems (56% com- pared to 76% nationally). [3] 1 The following information on MUFON confer- ence partici- pants is based on 161 surveys. 2 See General Social Surveys, 1972-1993: Cumulative Codebook of the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, August 1993, and the Statistical Abstract of the United States: 1996, 116th ed.

Statistics are available for the amount of campaign funds that come from individual dona- tions, but almost no one seems to have any idea what percentage of the popula- tion it is that makes those contributions. The only figure I have been able to locate so far states that less than 1% of the population made contributions in the 1992 con- gressional elec- tions.

Although he seldom actively cam- paigned for or donated money to political candidates (only 9% of us do campaign work, and only 29% of us make campaign contributions [4]), he was likely to support them by voting (87% of us vote, compared to anywhere between 36% and 55% nation- ally [5]). Charities and volunteer organiza- tions were more likely to get his financial contributions (85% of us give, compared to 73% nationally [6]), but once again, they were less likely to get his time (only 34% of us do volunteer work, compared with 48% nationally [7]). If one had to boil down MUFON sym- posium participants into a single person, that is who he would be. The picture of conference-goers as a group, however, is more diverse. For instance, the general age of the crowd tended to be older rather than younger (only 36% of attendees were under 45 years of age). And as other stud- ies have indicated, people in the UFO com- munity are generally well-educated. Fully 63% of us who attended the MUFON con- ference have at least a bachelor's degree, and 11% of us have gone on to get a doc- toral degree of some kind. (In the U.S. population as a whole, these figures are 16% and 1.5%, respectively. [8]) In terms of political affiliation, the make-up of the UFO community is generally in keeping with the national average: we are Demo- crats (31%), Republicans (27%) and Independents (25%). Although most of us are Protestant, a surprising number—27% of us—consider ourselves to be \"Other\" re- ligiously, a category that includes anything from Quaker to neo-pagan to Hindu to sim- ply \"spiritually evolving.\" Perhaps be- cause of our non-mainstream religious identification, many of us report that we seldom participate in the communal life of a religious group. Almost 35% were in this category. Another factor contributing to the low rates of participation in orga- nized religious life may be that 14% of us claimed to be agnostics/atheists (compared to 9% nationally [9]). While on the average we tend to be less pessimistic about society than the average American, the distribution of responses on t the two survey questions measuring social alienation shows that, like many others, we do feel that conditions are getting worse and that officials are not really very inter-"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL ested in the growing problems faced by the average person. We hold these opinions with varying degrees of firmness. Asked whether the condition of the average per- son was getting worse, 35% of us re- sponded positively, and another 14% of us responded strongly positively. Asked whether officials care about the problems of the average person, only 30% of us re- sponded with a simple positive, whereas a whopping 26% of us strongly agreed with the statement. T he relevance of these figures lies in their ability to shed light upon the common wisdom which holds that people who are interested in UFOs are harboring a deep-seated anomie and feel impelled to look for solutions to our social problems from \"out there.\" In fact, when compared to the average citizen, members of the UFO community (as represented by MU- FON Symposium participants) appear to be no more—and even somewhat less—so- cially alienated than the norm. One area of deviation from the demographic norm that has been revealed by this survey data is in the area of religious identity and participa- tion. However, that deviation may have less to do with the survey respondents as individuals interested in UFOs and more to do with the age of the respondents. Fully 41 % of us were between the ages of 46 and 60, i.e., Baby Boomers, who have been no- torious for their individualistic religious pursuits. [10J The same generational fac- tor may account at least in part for the somewhat greater tendency to view public officials as uninterested in the problems of the common person. If peoples' interest in UFOs does not seem to be strongly marked by such a pes- simistic outlook on society that they might begin to search for an otherworldly answer to social ills, then what does motivate their interest? The data collected does not di- rectly answer that question, but does sug- gest that personally having a UFO-related experience is not a pre-requisite for inter- est in the subject. Forty percent of us re- port having had a sighting of a UFO, while 53% say that they have never had their own sighting. Broken down further, most people (44%) had not had their own sight- ing but knew someone else who had had one, but a few (9%) said that not only had they never had a sighting of their own, but they did not know anyone else who had had one, either. It is not clear from the data whether those who have not had their own sighting, but know others who have, are referring to \"others\" within the UFO community, or whether the \"others\" are friends and family (initially) outside the UFO community. What is clear is that some people are not waiting for UFOs to find them; 7% of us have at some point ac- tively attempted to contact UFOs. Perhaps they will succeed: of those who have had their own UFO sightings, 73% of them say they had a prior interest in the subject. Only 11 % of conference participants claim that before their sightings they had no par- ticular interest. Although 40% of us report having had a \"simple\" UFO sighting, far fewer of us have experienced any of the effects often associated with such incidents. Eight per- cent of us indicated that we found physical traces after having a sighting, 8% saw UFO occupants, 9% felt that the surround- ing reality had been altered somehow dur- ing the sighting, but only 4% sustained physical effects on their persons. It is not clear that all of these figures necessarily represent sighting-related events, however. Marginal comments on the survey forms indicated that some respondents had expe- rienced the associated effects (e.g., sight- ing occupants) without a prior UFO sight- ing, but nevertheless considered the experi- ences to be UFO-related. H aving developed an interest in UFOs, MUFON conference participants were asked how they nurtured their interest. Most of us—90%—do so by reading. (By way of comparison, the cumulative re- sponse for this survey question at all con- ferences and meetings where it has been circulated is only 58%.) Almost as many reported getting information from watch- ing television shows and movies on UFO- related topics (88%) and from attending UFO conferences (85%). What is surpris- ing is the fact that only 65% said they at- tend local UFO meetings or study groups in order to further their knowledge. It might be interesting to speculate on the reasons for this relative lack of local par- ticipation and the ways in which it affects the development of ufology. Whatever our collective habits as re- gards the study of UFO topics, our efforts have led us to have a certain amount of trust that the mystery of UFOs will be 5 See the Statistical Abstract of the United States: 1996, Table 459. 6 Giving USA: The Annual Report on Philanthropy for the Year 1994 (American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel, 1995), 46. 7 See the Statistical Abstract of the United States: 1996, Table 608. 8 See the General Social Surveys for 1993 or the Statistical Abstract of the United States: 1996, Table 720, from which I de- rived the figure for doctoral de- grees. 9 See the General Social Surveys for 1993. 10 See Wade Clark Roof, A Generation of Seekers (New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 1993). 11 On this item, N=60.

Thirty percent expressed uncertainty on the question, but fully 50% of us said they were reasonably sure or absolutely sure that there was a discoverable answer and that we could find it. (The average date for this dis- covery, when one was suggested, was 2030. [11]) The means by which we will find the answer is, however, another matter. In keeping with the emphasis placed by the UFO community on ufology as a scientific discipline, most of us had relatively high levels of confidence in the ability of science to provide us with answers about the enigma. Fifty-three percent of us thought it likely or very likely that science would pro- vide the key that would open the door to fuller understanding. Nevertheless, a signif- icant number of us—29%—were more equivocal about science's potential contri- butions, and 16% of us were decidedly skeptical. The greatest measure of skepti- cism, however, was reserved for politics and religion as sources of ufological knowledge. Sixty-four percent said that they had little or no confidence that political revelations would produce any significant understand- ing about UFOs, and 76% expressed the same reservations about religion. Conversely—and interestingly, given the fact that so many conference partici- pants are not, themselves, UFO experi- encers in any sense of the word—73% of respondents indicated they thought it likely or very likely that we would ultimately learn more about UFOs through personal experience. The survey did not provide a way for respondents to indicate what \"per- sonal experience\" meant to them. It might indicate a belief that an individual en- counter with a UFO is the only thing that would be capable of satisfying anyone's curiosity about them. Or, it might indicate a belief that some kind of mass landing or UFO overflight, which would provide si- multaneous personal experience to masses of people, is really the only way we can ever hope to know more. W ith such a strong belief in the effi- cacy of personal experience as a means of knowing, and given the level of interest in abductions in recent years, it is interesting to note that the average confer- ence participant did not believe it was likely that he or she was an abductee. It is equally interesting to note that a significant minority of individuals could not \"just say • no\" to the idea, either. Although 65% of"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL us responded clearly and unambiguously that we were not abductees. 2% thought it unlikely but possible, 12% were uncertain either way, 3% were uncertain but thought it probable, and 15% were quite convinced of it. Men were more likely to flatly deny that they were abductees—72% of all men said \"no\" compared to only 55% of all women. In fact, the data indicates a posi- tive correlation between being an abductee and being female (r = .159). Nevertheless, of those who responded \"yes\" to the ab- ductee question, 58% were men. The posi- tive correlation between gender and ab- ductee status was expressed in this group by a higher mid-range distribution of women's responses to the abduction ques- tion. Eighteen percent of women respon- dents chose a simple \"maybe\" as their an- swer. Given the nature of their experiences, one might suppose that abductees (those flatly answering \"yes\" to the abduction question) are a unique group within the UFO community in other ways as well, but this does not seem to be the case. Like the average MUFON symposium participant, the average abductee at the conference had an income in the $36-50,000 a year range and a bachelor's degree. Fully 61% of ab- ductees had at least a bachelor's degree; 35% had master's degrees and 9% had doctoral degrees. Interestingly, those with the highest rates of negative response to the abduction question were individuals without a high school diploma (80% of whom responded \"no\"), those with only a high school diploma (86%). and those with a bachelor's degree (88%). More of those with some college education but no degree were likely to countenance the possibility of being an abductee (an average of only 60% saying \"no\"), as were those having taken degrees beyond the bachelor's level (an average of 56% saying \"no\"). Socially, abductees were no more likely to struggle with alienation than the average conference-goer. Half agreed that officials don't really care about the problems of the average person, compared to 56% of con- ference-goers as a whole and 76% of a na- tional sample. But they were more likely to equivocate: While 22% of conference- goers flatly disagreed with the statement, only 13% of abductees did, and a signifi- cant minority—37%—said they were un- sure whether it was true or not. An even larger percentage of abductees—58%— were unsure that the lot of the average per- son is getting worse. Few conference-go- ers (only 17%) and even fewer Americans in the general population (only 4%) re- sponded similarly. In the same vein, only 25% of abductees agreed that conditions are getting worse, while 50% of the confer- ence sample agreed and 66% of the U.S. population agreed. The most surprising single characteristic of abductees was the fact that the more strongly one identified as an abductee, the more likely it was that one would also value religion as a source of knowledge about UFOs (r = .219). Fourteen percent of probable or certain abductees thought it was \"most likely\" that we would learn more about UFOs from religion, compared to only 4% of conference participants in general. Yet levels of participation in reli- gious communities was as low among ab- ductees as it was among others at the con- ference. A key to this odd juxtaposition of confidence in and distance from religion may lie in abductees' extreme confidence in personal experience as a source of ufo- logical knowledge. While 93% of proba- ble or certain abductees saw personal expe- rience as a very good source of knowledge (r = .294), only 52% of the conference par- ticipants felt the same. It seems reasonable to suggest that for many abductees their personal experiences have affected them at profound levels of existence normally associated with reli- gious experience. The personal and the re- ligious thus become the most logical sources from which to expect further un- derstanding...though not the only sources. Abductees also expressed confidence in science as a source of understanding about UFOs at roughly the same rates as did con- ference participants as a whole (24% of ab- ductees responding in the highest confi- dence category compared to 28% of all re- spondents). So what is to be said about all this? I have begun a more elaborate survey pro- ject specifically targeting abductees in or- der to test and further refine the informa- tion I have acquired to date. (Abductees who would be willing to participate in that project are invited to contact me.) In fact, considered as a whole, the picture the data paints of MUFON symposium participants is a fairly positive one—abductees and all. If one wanted to say that abductions are phenomena that arise through negatively- \"If one wanted to say that ab- ductions are phenomena that arise through negatively-val- ued internal states and processes (such as anomie) exac- erbated by the sociological con- ditions of the ex- periencer (such as lack of edu- cation or lower socio-economic status), one would have a difficult time making that case based on this set of data.\" May 1997 Number 349 Page 13"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL May 1997 Number 349 Page 14 valued internal states and processes (such as anomie) exacerbated by the sociological conditions of the experiencer (such as lack of education or lower socio-economic sta- tus), one would have a difficult time mak- ing that case based on this set of data. U nfortunately, everything I have pre- sented in this paper must be set in a context that necessarily takes some of the luster off the bright picture I have painted. The most important point to keep in mind when it comes to this data is that it is based on a relatively small number of surveys. Although each and every symposium par- ticipant received a survey, only 161 indi- viduals returned them. Such a small num- ber of responses does not invalidate the data gathered from them, but it does make it important to recognize that the results may not be truly representative of the larger MUFON—much less UFO commu- nity—population. The second caveat re- garding this data is that the very population from which it was taken is a privileged group: those with enough financial re- sources (which suggests those with more education) to be able to afford to attend such conferences. This may skew educa- tion and income results toward the higher end of the scales. In addition, people with the level of affluence and freedom that en- ables them to travel may tend to be older, hence the larger numbers of attendees who were in the 46-60 age group. Although this particular survey group may not be totally representative of the larger UFO community, it certainly estab- lishes one thing: Early-on in my UFO studies I found a cartoon with two little aliens in the bubble top of a UFO flying away from Earth. One alien turned to the other and said, \"It's weird, Zork. We've been visiting that planet for years and the only ones who believe in us are the poor white trash!\" I think not.

It seems like the official state- ments made to members of the press and public by those representing our Air Force are, to put it delicately, on a course devia- tion from the truth. The Governor of the state had no com- ment to make about these sightings. The Arizona Republic published an article a full five days after the sightings took place. The mayor of Phoenix made a statement to one of the staff of Strange Universe when queried that no UFOs hovered above Phoenix. Even though we were told by news stations of reports made by pilots, the FAA was not forthcoming with any official word about the sightings, or foreign flying objects crossing air traffic lanes, or any other encouraging or discouraging word. Conventional explanations that were proffered included flares or a formation of airplanes, however, when all witness testi- mony is taken into account, such conven- tional explanations do not seem consonant with the facts. Even though this summary report consti- tutes a fraction of witness testimony for the night of March 13, it conveys a fair idea of the remarkable series of mass sightings that have occurred over Arizona and further re- ports could be made at some future date. Meantime, we are continuing to collect re- ports and keep an ever-vigilant eye on those crowded skies.

Beth thought. \"Nothing in [my] conscious mem- ory remotely compared to this imagined ex- perience. For surely that is what it was; a flight of fancy, some outlandish trick of the mind, a flaw in the subconscious. I was, God forbid, having a nervous breakdown!\" Her fear changed to a grim hope, though; even a mental breakdown would be preferable to accepting that some inscrutable reality lay behind such bizarre happenings. Happenings such as missing time episodes, for example. Co-written by two women who now be- lieve they are UFO abduction experiences, Connections portrays a formidable profusion of the bizarre and incredible. Beth Collings, the pragmatic rationalist, and Anna Jamerson, more open to speculative con- cepts, have written in parallel, alternating section by section throughout the book. Having met them at a book signing, I found it easy to visualize their individual personali- ties and narrative styles as I read their ac- counts. Both seem entirely sensible, grounded, forthright and earnest in person and in print. This view is seconded by Budd Hopkins, who devoted an appendix in his re- cent book, Witnessed, to them. Writing more or less chronologically — not in the order of hidden events' occur- rences but as they came to light — Beth and Anna carry us through a convoluted process of multiple revelations. As their individual explorations unfolded, they came in time to confront and grudgingly accept that they had shared common abduction experiences, even during girlhood years when they lived on different continents. It is interesting to com- pare their perceptions from their differing viewpoints as these common elements emerge. With considerable help, the details came to light slowly. The search began after Beth had an inexplicable time loss while driving home one night. Anna, who had read some of the classic UFO literature, thought Beth may have had an abduction, but Beth, the re- alist, would have none of such nonsense. Yet she continued to feel an undefined unease, fearing she was verging on some sort of mental breakdown. Persistently seeking to help her, it was Anna — utterly oblivious at the time to her own abduction history — who finally coaxed Beth to join her in meet- ing with Richard Hall of the Fund for UFO Research (FUFOR). Through such familiar UFO researchers as Hall, Rob Swiatek and Don Berliner, they met others with similar experiences. Later they also met Budd Hopkins and participated in the 1992 Abduction Study Conference at MIT. Connections contains upwards of 100 pages of literal transcripts of their hypnosis ses- sions conducted by Hopkins and others. Seasoned ufologists will find few unique occurrences in this book, but for the new- comer to the field, it affords perhaps the widest range of abduction experiences to be found in a single volume. Between them, Beth's and Anna's recollections cover virtu- ally the whole spectrum of reported UFO-re- lated experiences. In fact, if anything threat- ens the book's seeming verity, it's the sweeping variety, and their frequency, of phenomena visited on just two experiencers. There were forcible abductions by \"typi- cal\" alien grays from open fields, automo- biles, and bedrooms; medical examinations; mysterious lesions on various body parts; unexplained bleeding from ears and nose; early pregnancy symptoms experienced by both (even though Beth had had a hysterec- tomy!), followed by sudden returns to a non- pregnant state. B oth women underwent clinical gyneco- logical procedures resembling those widely reported by others, with various in- struments probing navels and genitalia. Anna also recalled at least one forced sexual coupling with an unwilling but helpless hu- man male. Another aspect that surfaces in many ac- counts is multigenerational abductions within the same family. As their search pro- gressed, Beth came to suspect that not only Seasoned ufologists will find few unique oc- currences in this book, but for the new- comer to the field, it af- fords perhaps the widest range of ab- duction expe- riences to be found in a single volume.

The fact that she seems powerless to forestall further intrusions continues to gall' her. B y her own admission, Anna suffers from a phobic fear/hate reaction to babies and small children, long a puzzle to her. Then, in the course of her hypnotic regressions, she recalled being taken into the presence of hy- brid children, some with sparse blond hair, and was repulsed by her captors' expectation that she pick them up and caress and com- fort them. During this session she told Budd, \"I hate [those] babies! They're not human! They don't look right.\" Besides the usual \"grays,\" other alien forms populated the women's experiences. Anna described one with reptilian skin as having pointed and tufted \"Spock-ears.\" During one altered-consciousness episode Beth was confronted by \"security enforcers\" appearing as very tall and brusque humans. And even the grays came in differing heights, with the taller ones clearly being in charge of the proceedings. Both women, in separate sessions, re- called having been indoctrinated in psychi- cally levitating and controlling physical ob- jects, evidently for either training or testing their mental powers. There were, of course, the missing time episodes that triggered their search. Both women experienced being levitated into hovering vehicles, and stepping or floating through closed doors and windows. Anna said the feeling, when going through a closed window, was \"Kinda tingly. It feels kinda good, like itching on the inside.\" There were the standard-issue warnings and projected scenes of purported impending cataclysmic catastrophes to devastate the earth. Also there were the usual electrical ef- fects: cars stalled at secluded places, one once suffering severe electrical system dam- age; sporadic extinguishment of street lights; mysterious phone calls, both with and with- out an originating voice; and failures of recorders and computers. Too, almost as im- possible to reconcile with our physics as is floating through solid windows and walls, is the coming on or staying on of electrical ap- pliances even when not plugged into an out- let! Yet this is an anomaly seriously reported by other experiences (as mentioned by John Carpenter in his \"Abduction Notes\" in the April '97 UFO Journal), and Beth, too, once found herself turning off a lighted lamp that was not plugged in. There were power outages localized to in- dividual bedrooms during visitations. Bob Huff of FUFOR installed a series of elec- tronic alarms designed to alert the women in the event of intrusion, but they failed to do so. Of course, when alien technology can so easily induce selective power failures and other electrical malfunctions, it's not surpris- ing that Huff's efforts were in vain. Beth's father once was questioned about her by two men in Air Force uniforms, and unmarked helicopters and planes flew over Anna's farm in apparent reconnaissance. Beth consciously recalled having one night approached a brightly illuminated roadblock manned by [human] police and unidentifi- able others, and having subsequently been waved on to continue her journey. Only dur- ing later hypnosis did she recall that at the roadblock she had been taken blindfolded to an unknown place, tied to a chair, and given an injection. Then, still blindfolded, she un- derwent a medical examination of some sort before she was returned to her car and sent on. Perhaps the most daunting aspect of this book is the persistence and frequency with which the inscrutable visitors seem to have intruded into these women's lives (and they still may be). Even if genetic experimenta- tion is the objective, intrusions more or less weekly would scarcely seem necessary. Whatever, Beth and Anna agree, \"Some- thing is certainly going on...\" And, unlike some abductees, they entertain no belief that the aliens are in the least altruistic. They're not here, they strongly feel, to help or to save us. A CATALOG OF UFO-RELATED PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS by John F.

I would, however, argue that he spent too little time addressing the really interesting question and too much time speculating about an infinitely less in- teresting aspect of the inquiry. Particularly, Mr. Prouty concentrated on the possible criminal liability by analogy to homicide and animal cruelty statutes. While this may be interesting, I'm certain Mr. Prouty knows that even in common law ju- risdictions, the criminal law is statutory. This fact demands that the relevant question to be posed is. \"Will the state legislatures or the federal congress enact a law which criminalizes the killing of an alien?\" The answer to that question depends upon sev- eral variables, the foremost being: 1) Do aliens exist and do they visit the earth? 2) If they exist will the government ever admit to it? 3) Are they in any way comparable to mankind? 4) Are their intentions hostile? 5) Do they require protection? The more interesting question then, is whether our courts would recognize a cause of action brought by either the \"survivors\" (usually family members) or estate of an alien who (which?) had been killed through the tortious act of a human. Most states al- low, either at common law or by statute, this sort of recovery in the case of the death of a human being caused by the tortuous act of another. While this cause of action would obviously be foreclosed in those states which recognize wrongful death and sur- vivor's actions by statute, it would be fasci- nating to see argument before a court as to the applicability of the common law causes of action to alien beings. It is most likely that the courts would'de- fer to the legislatures, claiming an inability to make a reasoned determination. However, there is always the possibility that this sort of case would force the courts to determine what it means to be \"a person.\" Does personhood require that one share 99.9% of the genetic material of the rest of humanity? Does it mean that one must be a member of the species Homo sapiens and therefore be able to procreate with other members of the species? Does it simply re- quire a threshold of intelligence and self- awareness and if so, what does this suggest about the rights of human beings with se- vere cognitive impairment? What I am driving at is that it is not very interesting what a bunch of legislators would decide as to the potential criminal penalties for killing an alien. What is inter- esting is what the common law courts would decide faced with such a bizarre set of unique circumstances. —Jon Andrew Bierman St. Louis, MO Mormonism In his April 1997 article called \"The God Hypothesis: A Review,\" Barry H. Downing wrote that we may believe \"UFOs are real, intelligent, and highly technological... have a spiritual and psychic dimension... carrying out a god-like role in our world...\" Many readers may be surprised to find out that a most astonishing and god-like close en- counter of the third kind happened in upper New York State during the early spring of 1820. Orson Pratt was a close friend of Joseph Smith. In his 1975 book. The Orson Pratt Journals, author Elden J. Watson reported that a 14-year-old youth named Joseph Smith visited a wooded clearing near his farm home in Manchester, New York. The date was the early spring of 1820. While praying, young Joseph saw a brilliant and glorious light in the clear sky that gradually descended towards him. As it drew nearer, the object increased in brightness and illu- minated the nearby trees and tops but did not consume the leaves and boughs. The ob- ject descended slowly and came to rest on the earth. A brilliant light engulfed the young man. Joseph said he was enwrapped in a heavenly vision and saw two glorious Many readers may be sur- prised to find out that a most astoni- shing and god-like close en- counter of the third kind happened in upper New York State during the early spring of 1820.

The two beings gave Joseph a religious message and departed. Joseph experienced a sense of well-being and relief and went home to describe the experience to his par- ents, brothers, and sisters. Over the years between 1820 and 1827, an angel named Moroni visited Joseph and gave him ad- vanced information about future events and of a religious nature. Moroni told Joseph about a book of engraved metal plates con- cealed within a stone box in the ground. Joseph said he recovered the buried plates, translated them with a translating instru- ment found in the stone box, and published the complete record as The Book of Mormon in 1830. Recorded in his own handwriting, these striking events seem to substantiate Downing's statement that the UFOs may have influenced the religious traditions of the nations of the world. —Kenneth Larson Los Angeles, CA Multiple Entity Abuse (MEA) I have been following the ongoing debate in the Forum regarding Helmut Lammar's MILAB story and Victoria Alexander's comments. Unlike Victoria, I admire the courage of such women as Leah Haley, Debbie Jordon, Linda Cortile, Katharina Wilson and the late Dr. Karla Turner, for coming forward with their personal stories. I know that there are hundreds (maybe thou- sands) of women who could tell similar sto- ries. I have spoken to many of them. As well as relating interfaces with other-dimen- sional entities, there has been obvious inter- ference in their lives from government sur- veillance, and even physical abduction. Unlike rape or abuse victims, these women do not have the luxury of appeal. And un- like rape victims (who can face and accuse their attackers), the abuse that women like Debbie Jordon experienced often takes place in a drugged state. Having experienced many of the same ordeals as Leah, Debbie, Linda, Katharina and Karla, I can understand their reticence in coming forward to legal authorities. Despite assurances that the crimes commit- ted against them will be addressed, all that has been received by them is ridicule, disbe- lief and loss of credibility. You will find that women, who have a life history of both alien and human inter- ference in their lives, may strive to make sense of their experiences by writing, either through published works or keeping jour- nals — I have 19 such journals. Unlike other abuse victims, whose lives fall apart, victims of Multiple Entity Abuse (MEA — my definition and which includes humans), often strive to excel in their fields, whether it be home-making, service to others, the arts, the sciences or humanities. The indi- vidual and combined strengths of these women is astounding. I would be interested in hearing from women with similar experi- ences with a view to telling their stories. —Angela Thompson Las Vegas, NV Remote Viewing I thought you did a fine job on the review of Jim Schnabel's book about remote view- ing. Loved the intro quotes from Fort! As you probably know. Schnabel and I were trained by [Ingo] Swann, simultane- ously. This stuff really works, but for places and structures here and now. Both JS and I were very successful in doing this during our training. Whether it can be used for predicting the future is altogether another thing. I doubt it, and Swann can't do it. When it comes to us- ing RV to communicate with aliens, Jesus, and so on, per Courtney Brown, I have more than just doubts. Ed Dames made sev- eral great leaps in this \"technology\" but without any proof that he was doing more than indulging in wild flights of imagina- tion. Brown learned at the feet of Dames, and since these two have done all the public talking about RV, their version of what RV is and can do has become the publicly re- ceived picture of remote viewing. The \"real\" remote viewers, including Swann, have refused to speak out, but in private are mortified. Remote viewers live and die by \"feed- back,\" meaning data that checks the results of the viewing. Swann has gone so far as to say that without feedback, the process should not be called remote viewing. This applies especially to remote viewing topics where there is no possibility of feedback, such as almost all of the work of Dames and Brown."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Over the past two years I've gotten to know a number of the RV insiders, mainly those who did it nine to five for the U.S. government, and they seem unanimous in saying that they were never officially tasked with a UFO related target. On the other hand, they all seem to take the existence of alien craft and aliens for granted, with a to- tally unemotional \"doesn't everybody know that?\" approach. This conclusion seems based on private remote viewing of UFO in- cidents. About six months ago the archives of the various government operational remote viewing projects were collected for the pur- pose of declassification. Names of individu- als will be deleted, as will other sensitive data, such as the names of embassies of \"friendly\" nations, and that sort of thing. We expect the sanitized records to be made public by the end of the year. The remote viewers are eagerly awaiting this, and be- lieve that when the real record of what they did is scrutinized, they will be vindicated. Schnabel's book is very well done. This amazed me, given his track record. I do think his publisher wanted something less snide and demeaning than his previous of- ferings on anomalies, and that may have re- sulted in the even-handed reporting job he finally turned in. The question for the UFO crowd is, can we use RV to learn anything useful about saucers? I think the answer is yes, but the technique must be used with great care, and even then we can only use the results as speculative and tentative. —Robert Durant Pennington, NJ Harrisburg \"Flap\" Joseph W. Ritrovata. in \"The Importance of UFO Waves and a Cyclic Connection with Some Curious Links\" (June, 1996, MUFON UFO Journal), cited the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) for a Harrisburg \"UFO flap\" in Feb. 1995. He also credited the *U* UFO Database for the information in the article. Ritrovata was identified as a researcher for a major daily newspaper. A public observatory and a public mu- seum's planetarium with which I am associ- ated had received no UFO reports for Feb. 1995, nor had I heard of sightings via the media or from other sources. I wrote to the state and section MUFON directors and Larry Hatch, who maintains the *U* UFO Database. The local MUFON director did not respond, but the others were unable to provide any information and were not aware of any reports from Harrisburg during the period. I also sent two letters to NUFORC, but because of a family emer- gency, the director of that project could not respond at that time. So, I had reached a dead-end. Recently, I came across the NUFORC Web page and noticed that for 2/27/95 there was an entry that a \"Mennonite College in- structor reports UFO flap is in progress in that area [Harrisburg] of PN.\" Although there are Mennonite people living in this area, I have never heard of an institution with that name. I checked with the State Department of Education and they con- firmed that no such institution existed in the state, but that there is an Eastern Mennonite University in Harrisonburg, VA. I suspected that perhaps voice-mail may have resulted in a garbled report, and wrote again to NUFORC with my suspicions as to what had happened. Peter Davenport kindly checked his records and confirmed (March 28, 1997 letter) that the caller's telephone area code was 703 and his address was in Harrisonburg, Va. Mr. Davenport agreed that a mistake had been made and that the entry on their Web page would be corrected. I believe it can be assumed that there is no evidence of a sighting \"flap\" at Harrisburg, PA, during February 1995. —Robert R. Young Harrisburg, PA Anniversaries on the Horizon...

She was in- strumental in building the Washington State organiza- tion as Assistant Director with Marilyn and Larry Childs, Co-State Directors, and Bob Gribble, Regional Director, from February 16, 1991 until 1994 when she became State Director. She was State Director until November 1994. She did extensive research and reading in ufology. She also belonged to CUFOS and CAUS. She fol- lowed the UFO topic for over thirty years. Her work (job related) was in psychiatric nursing. She held an R.N. degree. The highlight of her caring for others was the summer of 1996 when she volunteered her time to Carl Sagan and family when he was in Seattle undergoing treatment before he passed away. Judy worked tirelessly doing research in ufology even dur- ing her own difficult health challenges. She will be missed by family and friends.

FIELD INVESTIGATOR'S EXAM Anyone who has purchased and studied the 4th edi- tion of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual is eli- gible to take the exam via mail when they feel quali- fied. The 100-question test may be secured from MU- FON headquarters in Seguin and returned to Kathleen F. Marden, 103 Willow Road. East Kingston, NH 03827, for grading. In localities where field investiga- tor training classes are conducted, the instructor may order sufficient quantities of the test and administer the exam at the conclusion of the training classes. However, the majority of people will study the manual like a correspondence course before taking the exam. It is an open book test and other references may be utilized to broaden the scope of your knowledge. A passing grade is 75%. A few individuals have re- quested that they want to know which questions they missed. To supply the correct answers would make it possible for them to possess every answer to the test. Obviously, we would not like for them to share their answers with colleagues, therefore we have been re- luctant to do so. A study is being conducted, based upon questions consistently answered incorrectly, to revise the exam. Some of the True-False questions need rewording or eliminated as an example. A few questions are a mea- sure of the overall knowledge of Ufology of the exam- inee, based upon reading the literature. These answers are obviously not in the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual. For current members, the new manual may be purchased for $25.00 plus $3.50 for postage and handling from MUFON in Seguin. Congratulations to the people who have recently taken the Field Investigator's Exam and received a passing grade. Kathleen Marden now grades the ex- ams and forwards the name and score to MUFON headquarters, where Phyllis Hutson records the grade on your membership application, revises the applica- tion, and mails the new Field Investigator their new l.D. card.
