We want to express our thanks and gratitude to all of our members for your hard work and support, making 2005 a very successful year, and for helping MUFON to continue to be the world's largest UFO in- vestigative or- ganization. UFO sight- ings continued unabated. At John Schuessler times there were more sightings than we had in- vestigators to assign to all of the cases. Fortunately, however, as this message goes to press. 51 of our 830 Field In- vestigator Trainees completed their studies and passed the Field Investiga- tor Exam this year. We hope this trend will continue. Our Field Investigators are the people on the front line, getting the treasure trove of information buried in the cases\"\" that are reported to MUFON. Field Investigators-we thank you. New Case Management System We implemented the new Case Man- agement System (CMS) as a tool for State and Assistant State Directors to use to assign new cases for investiga- tions by Field Investigators. Those investigators now have access to the system to enter the results of their investigations. Case statistics may be viewed at www.mufon.com. Addi- tional enhancements to the CMS are in progress, and are aimed at making record keeping easier in the future.

Cao Gong reports that at approxi- mately midnight he suddenly heard a whirring noise moving towards him from the aluminum alloy glass windows at the north side of his bed. He sat up and saw a man and a woman dressed in strange attire stand- ing by the side of his bed. His first re- sponse was that they were thieves, and he became extremely frightened. The male visitor was approximately 5 1/2 feet tall, and the female was slightly shorter. Their eyes were in the shape of circles, and their mouths were empty round holes. Their heads were relatively large, and their bodies were fairly frail. Their stomachs were com- paratively thin, and their faces were fair-skinned without any color The pair were wearing silvery white tight-fitting clothes, similar to tinfoil, and they had their heads bound so that it was difficult to see clearly whether or not they had hair or ears. As he was studying them up and down, Cao Gong heard the woman say to her companion: \"He is the one who can cure illnesses. Let's take him!\" (Cao Gong possessed medical skills). Having said these words, the two Editor's Note This is an ongoing case, and some elements are not clear at this point, due to translation difficulties, and are subject to change. Bill Chalker, who recently returned from China, and who assisted with this article, is conducting additional research through his interpreters. It is antici- pated that he will be doing a follow- up article for the Journal. In addition to Chalker, we thank Flying Saucer Review for allowing us to use material. This drawing of a 1979-80 case in Vlaardingen, Netherlands, shows a shape similar to that described by Cao Gong in his 1999 abduction in China. The Vlaardingen case, not publicly reported until recently, involved a sight- ing of a \"big round dish with a long bar attached to it...maybe as large as a ship or airplane.\" The object was witnessed by a woman and her eight- year-old son. It is the son, now in his thirties, who reported the case, but he is not sure of the date. He says the sighting took place about 7:30 PM. December 2005 visitors moved through the wall at the north side of the bedroom, and Cao Gong's body became light and sprang up from the bed like a rubber ball, fol- lowing the pair through the wall. Cao Gong said that as he crossed through the wall he had the same feel- ing as pushing through the cotton cur- tain doors used in the countryside. Because he did not have time to put more clothes on, he felt extremely cold and muttered to himself: \"It's a little cold.\" It was as if the woman could read Cao Gong's mind, as there was the re- ply, \"You will warm up very soon.\" Sure enough, as soon as she had spo- ken those words, Cao Gong did not feel MUFON UFO Journal cold, but his head still had the sensa- tion of wind blowing past. According to what he remembered later, when they came out of the bed- room they flew in a southeasterly di- rection, with him being drawn along in flight. As they flew past several towns and cities, Cao Gong heard in his mind the two entities telling him specifically the places that were below him. Thus he knew that first of all he moved over the town of Liangxiang southeast towards Gu'an county. He then flew to the city of Bazhou, and then turned to fly in an eastwardly direction. Having flown past the city of Tianjin, he then flew north. Then the two told him that below"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"was the city of Qinhuang Dao. Then he flew north, and when he had travelled 50 or 60 miles distance, he started to float down to an uninhabited hilly re- gion. Cao Gong thought that the en- tire journey took only seven or eight minutes. After they had landed, Cao Gong saw a giant unidentified object shaped like a ping pong (table tennis) paddle. The section that corresponded to the handle of the paddle was the size of a basketball court; the section that corre- sponded to the face of the paddle was roughly the size of a football field. The two entities then took Cao Gong directly into the handle section of the object, and he experienced once again the same feeling of passing through a wall. Along with his two escorts, he ended up in a small room similar to a labora- tory. This small room seemed to be positioned in a medium-sized room, which in turn was connected to a large-sized room by means of a door. In the small room they had entered, there was no seating, and the lighting was soft. At this point, the male entity nodded in a friendly manner towards Cao Gong and calmed him down, saying that the reason he had been invited onto the craft was that they wanted to carry out an experiment using cosmic energy to cure an Earthling of illness. Thereupon, the woman asked her companion and Cao Gong to wait there while she walked towards the large room. When she entered the door of the large room, Cao Gong heard from in- side the room the sounds of machine equipment. He also heard the cries of pigs, dogs, oxen, sheep, and various other animals. The cries of these animals were wretched, as if they were being dis- sected or injected. The female entity returned with a 16 or 17-year-old Chinese girl by her side. The girl appeared to be seriously ill. The female entity made the girl stand where there was a symbol on the floor. Then the male entity strongly patted Cao Gong on the da zhui acupoint (be- tween the seventh cervical and first tho- racic vertebra). At once Cao Gong felt a burst of , Bopeh Province Famous 1942 photo of possible UFO. warmth flowing and surging around in his body. It was extremely comfortable, and from his elbows down to the palms of his hands and fingers he felt pins and needles like an electric discharge. The male entity signaled to Cao Gong to use the same method that he had just demonstrated in order to treat the girl. At this point, the female entity took some sort of instrument, five or six small metal bottles, and an object that resembled a black flashlight from a case on the floor. She placed the instrument and the small metal bottles in front of the legs of the seriously ill girl. She placed the object that resembled a black flashlight on top of the girl's head and pushed downwards. From inside the contraption came an air-tight object that had the appearance of a transparent raincoat. It smoothly began to cover the girl and the small metal bottles, sticking tightly to the floor. The male entity signaled for Cao Gong to start the experiment. Using his hands and strength Cao Gong began patting the da zhui acupoints of the sickly girl, feeling some kind of heat flow from his hands into the girl's back. When Cao Gong wanted to move his arms away from the girl, a kind of gi- MUFON UFO Journal ant absorbing force prevented him from doing so. The entire process lasted approxi- mately five minutes, during which his arms became numb, and the sensation of an electric charge came out from his palms and fingers, flowing into the girl's back. The girl's body resembled something like a leather bag, all shaking and twisted. Cao Gong was shocked by the fact that the transparent cover which shrouded the girl was now full of what appeared to be filthy gas. The girl now seemed to be full of vim and vigor, hardly resembling the person she was before. When the two entities saw that the experiment had been successful, they let out peals of laughter. They then invited Cao Gong to ob- serve their large laboratory, but he was extremely frightened because he con- tinued to hear the wretched cries of ani- mals. The two entities seemed able to sense his feelings, so they decided to return Cao Gong to his home. They ar- ranged their clothes and then leaned their bodies slightly forward. Cao Gong was drawn up, flying into the sky. The two entities flew in front of him, draw- ing Cao Gong towards Beijing. They flew to the south side of Cao December 2005"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Gong's home, moving through the wall as before, but this time they were not in Cao Gong's room, but in the room where his wife, 9-yer-ol son, and 11- year-old daughter were sleeping. Cao Gong's son, Cao Xing, turned over in his sleep, and Cao Gong said to the two entities, \"This is my son Cao Xing.\" The male entity said, \"Let him sleep, do not disturb him.\" At this point, his son suddenly sat up and shouted, \"How did these people get in?\" The son also reportedly said, \"What happened to that nerve in my brain in charge of sleeping?\" Cao was puzzled how his son could say such words at such a young age. As Cao Xing reportedly said these words, the two entities took Cao Gong into his own bedroom. For a long time after returning home, Cao Gong was unable to calm down. He thought deeply about his bizarre journey, and at about 4 AM he hurriedly told his experience to aufologist, Miss Ma Linghuan. Ma Linghuan, a member of the Beijing UFO Research Association, in 1998 investigated Meng Zhaoguo's contact with aliens. Consequently, she urged Cao Gong to quickly record the entire event so as not to forget anything, and he did this. Cao Gong made the four following con- clusions: 1. Aliens have the ability to read people's thoughts. 2. Aliens can float and move at fast speeds. 3. When aliens speak, Earthlings do not understand them, but when Earth- lings speak aliens understand and can speak our language. 4. This is all true. Professor Sun Shili, the renowned director of the Beijing UFO Research Association, made the following com- ments: \"As for Cao Gong, the figure at the center of this incident, we first checked his personality traits and discovered that he is a man dedicated to public wel- fare. \"Those that know him all admit that he is a respectable man of upright be- havior, thus ruling out personality traits where he would wilfully fabricate lies.\" Mr. Zhang Jingping of the World Chinese UFO United Association car- ried out practical examinations regard- ing this incident and told journalists: \"At that time we invited the Beijing Police Psychology Investigation Group to carry out regression hypnosis and psychological tests, namely polygraph tests in order to prove the validity of Cao Gong's account. \"During Cao Gong's regression hyp- nosis, he drew portraits of two aliens and a rough sketch of a huge unidenti- fied object. \"The polygraph tests proved that during the incident: \"Cao Gong saw a flying saucer, aliens, and a girl; \"the incident was real and not a dream or a fabrication; \"Cao Gong narrated the story with- out making anything up, without exag- geration, without any special reason or motive; \"the accounts from Cao Gong's son as well as Miss Ma provide strong col- lateral evidence; \"and finally, at the site of the inci- dent the girl involved was found.\" The girl was reportedly located and \"confirmed\" via locals, the police identikit picture, by meeting with Cao, and \"body marks.\" The \"body marks\" were not de- scribed. She reportedly is a simple country girl with limited mental capac- ity. Retired Chinese official suggests that ETs may be living among us Considering the recent rash of UFO sightings over China, it is worth noting the opinion of Sun Shili. a retired for- eign ministry official who is now presi- dent of the Beijing UFO Research So- ciety-he believes waixingren (extrater- restrials) are living among us. Sun says his first close encounter oc- curred in 1971, when he was sent to the remote countryside during the \"cul- tural revolution\" (1966-76) to perform the grueling task of rice planting. One day while toiling in the field, his attention was diverted to a bright ob- ject in the sky, which rose and fell re- peatedly. At first, Sun assumed the spectacle was some sort of monitoring device, a reasonable deduction consid- ering the times Years later, after reading foreign materials on UFO sightings, he knew he had experienced a close encounter. Today, Sun does not rule out any pos- sibility, including aliens living and working in Chinese society, a position difficult to refute. And Sun is not the only expert in the country taking these sightings seriously. According to the highly-accredited Shen Shituan, a real rocket scientist, president of Beijing Aerospace Univer- sity, and honorary director of the China UFO Research Association, every re- port of an alien encounter is worth in- vestigating. Shen doesn't dismiss any story as too absurd, including the claims of one worker that aliens entered his Beijing home while his wife and children were present, and whisked him 265 kilometres east and back in only a few hours [the Cao Gong abduction]. But what do these aliens want? Why visit China? One media pundit has pointed to the interesting parallels be- tween America's close encounters of the 1950s and the spate of recent visi- tations to China. In the 1950s, with the US set to dominate world affairs, observers from other worlds may have wanted to learn more about the growing superpower. Following this logic, China's extraor- dinary development could be attracting the attention of alien visitors. -Rosanne Lin, Shanghai Star December 2005 MUFON UFO Journal"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Father and daughter experience mysterious teleportation on Michigan highway By Bill Konkolesky State Director, Michigan MUFON At just after 1 AM on the morning of Aug. 27, 2004, 43-year-old John Stephens (witness names are pseud- onyms) was driving from Imlay City, MI, to his home in Leonard with his 14-year-old daughter Rose in the pas- senger seat.He had picked her up from a visit to Rose's mother. Suddenly something very peculiar occurred. They instantly found them- selves more than 6 miles away, head- ing in a different direction, on a road they didn't recognize-still traveling at the same rate of speed. As Stephens recalls, at the onset of their experience the two of them were southbound on S. Lake Pleasant Road, just 15 minutes from their home, dis- cussing the start of Rose's upcoming school year. Stephens specifically recalls the time 1:09 AM on the dashboard clock, and the thought that they would easily be home before 1:30 AM on this very fa- miliar route. Then suddenly, says Stephens, the road ahead instantly \"fogged,\" and then immediately \"pixilated\"back into clar- ity. In an instant, John and Rose had both suddenly stopped their animated dis- cussion as though they had actually completed it sometime earlier in the evening. They then looked at each other and commented on the strangeness of what had just happened. Then, a few seconds later, things got much stranger for them as they both realized that their sur- roundings were now unknown to them. Somehow, impossible as it appeared to them to be, they were no longer on Pleasant Lake Road. Stephens recalls looking at the dash- board clock at this point and noting the time as 1:14 AM. The clock supported their impressions that, even with the caveats of the sudden different environ- ment and their seemingly abrupt stop in conversation, no time had passed for which could not be accounted. Also, the radio was not on for them to notice a skip in a song that might have otherwise been playing or any other similar indicator. In addition, there was no noticeable depletion in gas or any adverse effects on their vehicle, a 2003 Ford Explorer Sport-Trac. And, although this may just be an interesting coincidence-adding to their feeling of disorientation-the witnesses noticed that at their new location there was a surprisingly high concentration of deer, accompanied by small animals, including a skunk and raccoon directly alongside, as well as crossing, the road. Although Stephens and his daugh- ter were completely unaware of where they were after the momentary appear- ance of the fog, they felt it safest to con- tinue on the route on which they found themselves. All they knew was that, according to the vehicle's compass, they were driving west at this time when they had been driving south. Within minutes, they discovered that they were somehow on E. Newark Rd, on a stretch of road unfamiliar to them. As they drove forward, they arrived shortly at M24, a road they readily rec- ognized. As they got onto M24 and saw a sign, indicating the city of Metamora was just south of them, they realized that they had mysteriously \"teleported\" several miles northeast of their original loca- tion. This would turn out to be a distance of approximately 6 miles, as the crow flies, that they had immediately, seamlessly, and most mysteriously jumped. When they arrived home, both be- gan to feel the onset of an unexplained mild tingling sensation throughout their entire bodies, with a touch of nausea. This lasted until they fell asleep, and was not present when they awoke. They were so shaken that Rose did not get to MUFON UFO Journal sleep until 4 AM, and John not until 9 AM!. No other seemingly-related adverse or unusual sensations were felt by the witnesses at the time of the event or after. At this time, there is no speculative cause of what happened to them with any firm degree of evidence to support it, including no direct evidence of UFO involvement. Interestingly, Mr. Stephens has a his- tory of seemingly unrelated anomalous events, including being visited by balls of light and experiencing astral projec- tion. However, there was nothing that would seem to tie in directly with what happened in the early morning hours of Aug. 27. There are some details worth men- tioning in support of witness credibil- ity. Mr. Stephens is a test-driver for Ford Motor Company, having a profes- sional knowledge of driving. Both John and Rose have excellent vision and do not wear corrective lenses. According to the witnesses, there were neither intoxicants nor illicit substances involved. This investigation is ongoing. Any of you who may know the identity of these individuals are encouraged to please maintain their anonymity.

An integral WWVB receiver provides day of year, hour, and minute informa- tion in a binary format, allowing very accurate correlation of all sensor data with Universal lime. Some of the special features of the magnetometer are: continuous operation when desired, with optional mode for automatic triggering by either magnetic phenomena or external trigger inputs; an output for triggering of external equip- ment; an integral battery charger/elimi- nator; auditory monitoring of magnetom- eter operation; automatic shut-off after 60 seconds if triggering stimulus does not recur (conserving battery and tape); ad- justable system-trigger sensitivity; and a noise-filter capacity. Because the GCN-A51 was designed for automatic detection and recording of electromagnetic \"signatures\" reportedly associated with some UFOs, it was de- cided that the unit providing the best prob- ability of recording magnetic profiles rec- ognizable as being anomalistic would be one with a low false alarm rate.

It is not well known in UFO circles that Michigan, particularly southeast Michigan, had a run of UFO sightings during the spring and fall of that year. Lisa and Katina, two high school stu- dents of mine, each had a close encoun- ter with a saucer-shaped object and made drawings. These sightings occurred in Romulus, MI, just outside the confines of Detroit Metro Airport. Lisa de- scribed the object \"as white with big lights,\" and estimated it to be about 100 feet in length. It's encouraging to me to see near duplicate encounters reported by indi- viduals who live thousands of miles MUFON UFO Journal apart, with sightings coming so many years apart.

Researchers found that an additional 1.5 percent of the human DNA coding was not found in chimps, and 1.5 per- cent of the chimp coding was missing in humans-bringing the total difference between the two genomes to 4 percent. Even more intriguingly, the other 4 percent appears to contain clues to how we became different from our closest relatives in the animal kingdom, they said. In comparison, the genetic codes of two typical humans are only 0.1 per- cent different. On the other hand, the difference is 10 percent for mice vs. rats, and 60 percent for humans vs. mice. As expected, of the coding that was common to both human and chimp ge- nomes, 99 percent was identical. \"We're really looking at an individual evolutionary event, and this is spectacu- lar,\" said University of Washington ge- neticist Robert Waterston, senior author of a study in the journal Nature pre- senting the draft of the chimpanzee ge- nome. Darwin's claim confirmed Researchers said the chimp/human comparison served as the most dra- matic confirmation yet of Charles Darwin's claim in 1871 that humans and chimpanzees had a common ances- tor. \"I couldn't imagine Darwin hoping for a stronger confirmation of his ideas than when we see the comparison of the human and chimpanzee genome,\" Waterston told reporters during a Wash- ington news conference. The researchers also used the chimp genome as a new reference point for judging how rapidly various areas of genetic code have changed: Waterston said it appeared that genes 8 linked to the wiring of the nervous sys- tem and the perception of sound changed particularly quickly in pri- mates, compared with other mammals. As for genetic changes that are pe- culiar to humans, the \"most intriguing\" one involves transcription factors, the proteins responsible for controlling the expression of other genes, Waterston said. Scientists believe that tweaks in tran- scription factors may spark rapid evo- lutionary change, even though the genes they control are relatively unchanged- just as the same classical melody can sound dramatically different when given a jazz interpretation. The achievement should lead to dis- coveries with implications for human health, including new approaches to treating age-old diseases, said Francis Collins, director of the National Human Genome Research Institute. \"As we build upon the foundation laid by the Human Genome Project, it has become clear that comparing the human genome with the genomes of other organisms is an enormously pow- erful tool for understanding our own bi- ology,\" he said in a written statement. The chimpanzee genetic blueprint is the result of a multimillion-dollar ef- fort involving 67 researchers from the United States, Israel, Italy, Germany, and Spain. MUFON UFO Journal In addition to that blueprint, more than a dozen other related reports have recently been published in Nature and two other scientific journals. Science and Genome Research. Small but crucial differences The researchers said the results con- firmed the common evolutionary ori- gin of humans and chimpanzees. Out of the 3 billion base pairs in the DNA coding for chimps and humans, about 35 million show single-base dif- ferences, and another 5 million DNA sites are different because of insertions or deletions of genetic code. Waterston estimated that 1 million of those coding changes are responsible for the functional differences between humans and chimps-thus defining our humanness. Six new genetic frontiers Scientists identified six regions of our DNA that appear to have evolved dramatically over the past 250,000 years-including a \"gene desert\" that may play a role in nervous system de- velopment, and also has been linked to obesity. They said a seventh region that showed notable change contains the FOXP2 gene, which already has been linked to speech in humans. Brain genes key A comparison of gene expression in various tissues indicated that most of the genetic changes occurring during the evolution of chimps and humans had neither a positive nor a negative effect. However, the testes in the males of both species showed strong evidence of a positive effect. Also, genes active in the brain showed much more accu- mulated change in humans than in chimps-suggesting that those genes played a special role in human evolu- tion. Primates' risky business Scientists compared the chimp and human genomes with those of mice and rats, and found that both primates car- December 2005"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"ried a greater amount of potentially harmful genetic coding. They speculated that such coding may have made primates more prone to genetic diseases, but also more adaptable to environmental changes. Clues to diseases The genomes contained hints that the chimpanzee genetic code has been at- tacked more frequently than humans by retroviral elements-such as those present in the HIV virus. Scientists also noted key differences between the genomes that may affect susceptibility to viruses, the workings of the immune system, and the progres- sion of diabetes and Alzheimer's dis- ease in humans. The researchers emphasized that the studies raised more questions than an- swers, and that it would take years to decipher the meaning behind differ- ences in genetic coding. For example, although six new re- gions of rapid evolutionary change have been identified, \"we don't know what natural selection in these regions acted upon,\" said Tarjei Mikkelsen, a gradu- ate student at the Massachusetts Insti- tute of Technology, who was the first listed author for the chimp genome study. But Waterston said the \"really big picture\" is that geneticists can now fo- cus on the small percentage of DNA coding that is peculiar to humans, and figure out how that coding works. \"We're probably down to a million or so changes in the human genome that are even candidates for being the changes that have made us human,\" he told MSNBC.com. \"So it's fun and exciting to be looking at nature's lab notebook like this.\" How has the brain changed? A separate study, published by Sci- ence, looked at how genes were ex- pressed in the brain, heart, liver, kid- ney and testes of chimpanzees and hu- mans. That study found that the brain showed the least differences between species, while the liver showed the most. Those findings may seem to go against the idea that brain development was crucial to the emergence of mod- ern humans But the senior author behind that study, Svante Paabo of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany, told MSNBC.com that the results were in line with evolutionary theory. He said the coding for the brain is complex and highly constrained-mean- ing that too much change would impair brain activity-while the coding for a \"simple\" organ such as the liver could vary more without having a negative impact. \"However, even given these con- straints, we see that something special has gone on with the function of the brain in human ancestors,\" Paabo said in an e-mail message, \"since if we com- pare how much change occurred in human ancestors versus in chimp an- cestors, more change happened in our ancestors than in the ancestors of the chimps in genes expressed in the brain.\" Paabo is well-known for his study of the FOXP2 gene, the \"language gene,\" and he said that further analy- ses of the chimpanzee genome were likely to turn up additional genes that are responsible for characteristics pe- culiar to humans. Broader perspectives For his part, Waterston said the ge- nome analysis brought a broader per- spective to the question of what makes us so different from chimpanzees. \"You have to think about it the other way: Are we really as different from chimps as we think? And I think the basic conclusion has to be that we are not,\" he told MSNBC.com. \"What we see as profound differ- ences are actually somewhat superfi- cial: We walk upright, and they don't. We have less hair, and they have more. We have more complicated brains. These are fine tuning.... The challenge will be to figure out what the critical differences are.\" -Alan Boyle, science editor © 2005 MSNBC Interactive aripi rrj Planned giving can be beneficial to both MUFON and to your own tax and estate situation.

Could the introduction of human cells into primate brains make them more \"humanlike\"? How would one tell? Where should the line be drawn? To answer such questions, Johns Hopkins University assembled a group of 22 philosophers, neuroscientists, pri- matologists, stem cell researchers, and other experts, including Stanford Uni- versity law professor Hank Greely. \"We can't say that it is impossible that putting human stem cells into non- human primates will lead to some as- pect of humanlike, although it is highly unlikely,\" said Greely, \"and no one is trying to do that.\" Because future therapies may re- quire testing in primates, the panel sought to create responsible research guidelines. \"We may want animal tests before we use treatments in humans,\" said Greely. \"The closer to humans you get, the better your model-but the better your model, the more you worry about 'hu- manizing' the animal you put the cells into,\" he said. Six factors should be considered before attempting such research, their report concluded. They include: the number of human cells injected, the age of the animal, the species, the size of the animal's brain, the site of injection, and whether the animal's brain was injured or diseased. -Appeal Democrat, Marysville, CA -Thanks to Kathlyn Bunyard Within days of reading \"DNA and the future of ufology\" in the July MUFON UFO Journal, the above ar- ticle appeared in our local newspaper.

The purpose of the planned collision was to ascertain the true makeup of such a primordial comet by observing and analyzing the impact and debris. The successful collision was ob- served from the spacecraft and a vari- ety of Earth-placed and Earth-orbiting instruments. A major puzzle As the reports of what had been ob- served begin to trickle out, it becomes evident that the scientific community is facing a major puzzle. The blast, instead of confirming the comet as a celestial body formed in the solar system's deep-frozen outer fringes, \"set loose key ingredients of Earth\" (according to the headline in the San Francisco Chronicle of 9/9/05). Among the perplexing emerging findings are these: •Comets are described as \"frozen balls of dirty ice.\" The findings from Tempel-1 indicate that it is made of broken up rocks that contain clays and carbonates-the minerals of limestones and seashells that are formed only in liquid water. \"How do clays and carbonates form in frozen comets where there isn't liq- uid water?\" asked Dr. C.M. Lisse, a Mission scientist, according to the New York Times of Sept. 7, 2005; \"Nobody expected this.\" •The Spitzer space telescope also detected in Tempel-1 crystalline sili- cates-a form of the mineral that re- quires at least 1300 degrees Fahrenheit temperatures to form. \"How do you put that stuff into a comet that forms out by Pluto?\" asked the puzzled Dr. Lisse. How, indeed, do you get mineral-melting temperatures in a region of absolute cold? Life's chemicals too Reporting some of the initial puz- zling findings at a scientific meeting at Cambridge University in England on Sept. 7-8, 2005, Dr. Lisse (of John Hopkins University), Dr. Michael 10 A'Hearn (University of Maryland), and other scientists expanded the list of Earthlike components discovered in the comet to include chemicals associated with living organisms. They listed (in addition to clays and silicates) carbonates, iron sulfides, alu- mina, and compounds called PAHs \"which are among many organic chemi- cals that show up in living organisms on Earth.\" Another reported surprise: \"The team has detected an unexpectedly high concentration of methyl cyanide. Biolo- gists say methyl cyanide is a key player in reactions that form DNA\" (Chris- tian Science Monitor). A comet in the wrong place? Comet Tempel-1 is not a new comet. It was discovered in 1867 by Ernst W. L Tempel of Marseille, France, and its very short period of less than six (Earth) years was determined that same year by C. Bruhns of Leipzig, Germany. It was thereafter observed on and off until it and its slightly changed orbit were re-determined in 1963 by the American astronomer E.G. Marsden. \"Comets form way out in the frigid edges of the solar system, and their nuclei remain deeply frozen during most of their passage through the inner solar system,\" said Dr. Lisse in point- ing out the problems astronomers and astrophysicists now face. Yet it is beyond doubt that the comet has been orbiting the Sun in a relatively limited and nearby part of the solar sys- tem, between Mars and Jupiter. How then explain this \"wrong place\" of comet Tempel-1? Dr. Lisse rejected speculation that the comet \"migrated to the warmer inner solar system within the last 10,000 years.\" Indeed, were it ever formed out there in the deep freeze, it would not be so Earthlike in all the other respects enu- merated above. The Sumerian solution In fact, there seems to be only one simple solution to the host of enigmas now puzzling the scientists: •Comet Tempel-1 is where it is be- cause it was \"born\" there, between Mars and Jupiter; MUFON UFO Journal •It is Earthlike in its components because it and the Earth were \"born\" of the same planetary \"mother.\" Readers of my books will hardly need reminding that that planetary mother was called Tiamat in the Sumerian Epic of Creation. This is a text deemed by scholars to be an allegory, a myth, a religious text- but treated by me in The 12th Planet and Genesis Revisited as a sophisti- cated cosmogony dealing with the cre- ation of our Solar System and the fate of Tiamat. Tiamat was a watery planet that had existed in the space between Mars and Jupiter and was destroyed in a celes- tial collision with an invader-planet (Nibiru). As a result of the collision: •Half of Tiamat was smashed to bits and pieces to become the asteroids and short-term comets that orbit between Mars and Jupiter; •The other half was thrust closer to the Sun to become planet Earth; •The leading large satellite of Tiamat (\"Kingu\") was carried along to become Earth's Moon; •Tiamat's other ten satellites were broken up to become comets, especially those with retrograde orbits. Sumerian texts dealing with Nibiru explicitly state that during the collision the life-bearing Nibiru transferred the \"seed of life\"-what we now call DNA and the \"chemicals of life\"-to the van- quished Tiamat, and thus to Earth and, we can now realize, to an asteroid called Tempel-1. The Sumerian texts, as I expounded them, answer all the puzzles flowing from the Tempel-1 collision. Now that science has caught up Even before this more detailed (but not yet full) extent of the discoveries that puzzle astronomers and astrophysi- cists was publicized, keen-eyed fans of mine have sent to me congratulatory messages: Your 12th Planet theories have just been proved!

The human-dog relationship greatly increases the chances of a dog being present and their behavior noted during a UFO event. Canine reac- tions to UFO events were classified as follows: 1. Alarm behaviors, which include becoming alert, becom- ing rigid with attention directed o u t - ward, barking, and barking and excite- ment. On a continuum of behavior this is the earliest point of uncertain behav- ior that can lead to fearful behavior (30 sightings). 2. Fearful behaviors, which cover the anxiety through fear section of the be- havior continuum. In fear situations, the dog may drop or clamp its tail down, tremble, freeze, try to hide, try to es- cape, become frantic, cling to a human companion, or cry out (27 sightings). 3. Calm behaviors,which describe dogs aware of the UFO who appear as calm, oddly calm, interested, and, rarely but interestingly, behaving as if mes- merized (10 sightings). 4. Unaware, indifferent. These ani- mals do not seem to notice the UFO (10 sightings). 5. Howling. Many of these sightings are also in the Alarm section, but wit- nesses describe \"barking and howling.\" Initially I thought that the \"howling\" descriptions were careless wording. Then some sightings were found that clearly reporting howling dogs, some- times in situations where one would not expect a dog to howl. So this category was created for further investigation (11 sightings). Abilities Sense of smell and hearing is phe- nomenal in dogs. They live in a world of smells that we humans cannot imag- ine. Their hearing is far superior to ours, extending to much higher frequencies. It is the outstanding senses of smell and hearing that make dogs excellent early-warning, alarm raising watch- dogs. They are very sensitive to high-pitched sounds (such as the silent dog whistle), and at times dogs appear to suffer pain when exposed to some high-pitched sounds. Many dogs are supersensitive to common sounds and exhibit mild to extreme fear reactions to sounds that other dogs do not appear to notice or care about. Frequently with age, this \"irrational\" fear becomes greater. Two examples are fear of a distant gunshot that a human can barely hear, and fear of electrical transformer noises-very different types of sound, but each terrifying to some dogs. The vision of dogs is generally of less importance to them than are smell and hearing. Their visual acuity is less than half human's, but they are very sensitive to movement. Dogs are not particularly sensitive to touch, although this varies between individuals. Dogs are highly variable as individu- Editor's Note This article, Part Three in a se- ries, is abridged from Ms. Woodward's full presentation, in- cluding charts, case descriptions, and other material, which is included in the MUFON booklet Animal Re- actions to UFOs. The full report is also included in the 2005 MUFON Symposium Proceedings. (See UFO Marketplace, page 23.) About the Author Ms. Woodward worked with the Na- tional Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) in the 1960's, assisting with the original UFO Evidence (1964). She returned to ufology in 1996 as a field investigator for MUFON and the Fund for UFO. Re- search after retiring from the U.S. Geo- logical Survey as a research technician. She assisted Richard Hall in devel- oping an index of James E. McDonald's correspondence in the Donald E. Keyhoe Archives, and worked on data compi- lation for Hall's Alien Invasion or Hu- man Fantasy? Ms. Woodward later took over the animal reactions section of Francis Ridge's special evidence section of the NICAP web site. She also has exten- sive experience with both domestic and wild animals. als. They range from painfully shy to bold and aggressive, with most some- where in the middle. UFO altitudes and distances The range of UFO altitudes in sightings with dogs present is similar, no matter how the dogs reacted. The lowest altitude reported was landed or near landed, and the greatest was 2,000 feet. Most common were altitudes of 200 feet or less. Likewise, distances were also simi- lar no matter how the dogs reacted, ranging from overhead to 1/4 to 1/2 mile estimates. The most common dis- tances of the UFOs were from over- head to 500 feet away. I predicted that sightings with fear- ful dogs would be closer encounters than sightings with alert-alarm dogs, but the prediction remains questionable. Based on 23 sightings with alarm-raising dogs with estimated dis- tances, the distances of the UFOs were distributed fairly evenly from overhead (30 percent) to 200 feet away (26 per- cent) to 500 feet away (30 percent). Only 16 sightings with fearful dogs had estimated distances, and the equivalent distances to the UFOs were December 2005 MUFON UFO Journal 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"38 percent, 19 percent, and 25 percent. Closer encounters and fearful dogs remain an open question, and one that may be complicated by other factors, such as the dog's temperament, hear- ing, and fear sensitivities-and possibly other secondary effects of the UFOs that may be present. A very interesting study of dog re- actions relative to distance from the UFO is reported in AR 12, a 1965 Ev- erglades case. The witness, James Flynn, had a long history of working with dogs, which gives his canine observations extra weight. This event took place after mid- night as Flynn was searching for some lost dogs. The dog of interest was in a dog crate on board a swamp buggy driven by Flynn. Flynn observed a light, and be- gan driving toward it. When about 1/4 mile away from the light, he stopped to look at it through binoculars. He could hear a \"diesel generator\" sound (which I understand is a deep sound), and he noticed his crated dog seemed bothered by the sound. Flynn drove closer, now stopping his swamp buggy about 600 feet from the object. At this point his dog was howl- ing and trying to escape from its crate, and the sound from the UFO was now loud and high-pitched. Flynn attributed the dog's behavior as a reaction to this sound. At this point Flynn proceeded on foot and walked up to the hemispheric object, where he was knocked out. From the point of view of the dog reaction, mild distress at 1/4 mile turned into severe distress at 600 feet. Generally, howling is not compatible with escape behavior. This is a very odd combination of dog behaviors, and will be addressed later. In this sighting, Flynn attributed the dog's reactions to the sound emanating from the UFO, and the dog's fear level did increase as distance to the UFO decreased. Sound and dog reactions Not only do dogs hear over a wider range of frequencies than humans do, but also their ears are great sound-collecting mechanisms with muscles for swiveling the ear in the di- rection of the sound. For a given sound, the dog can hear it at three or four times UFO which upset Flynn's dog, as drawn by Richard Hall, based on a report by the Aerial Phenomena Reserch Organization (APRO). the distance that a human can hear the same sound. In sightings where dogs seem un- aware of the UFO, sound is reported in only two sightings. One was AR41, where a dog slept undisturbed through a sighting with a grinding, buzzing UFO, although a cat was frightened and ran. No information was given on the dog's health or age. Similarly, the second sighting is AR78, where a blind dog did not no- tice as a boomerang making a low hum- ming sound moved overhead. No men- tion was made of the dog's ability to hear. When dogs were calm or interested in the UFO, sound was reported 50 percent of the time and described as follows: AR19-UFO silent when investi- gated by dog, but after the dog left the area there was an electric hum, high-pitched, low-pitched, and air sound. AR40-Rumbling through sighting, then high pitched sound on take-off. AR42-Wind sound and trees seen moving. AR72-Knocking, thudding. Some of the dogs in the calm cat- egory may be under other influences. For instance, AR40, the Delphos trace case, the dog is described as standing still and quiet with hackles NOT up. Note the sound did not be- come high-pitched until take off. The witness reported feeling immobilized. Was the dog immobilized? The description of the dog's behav- ior is similar to other sightings where witnesses did not feel immobilized. For instance, in AR26 the dog was sitting quietly, looking up. In AR42, normally alarm-raising dogs were quiet and still. In AR72, the dog was curious, fixed, standing alert. In AR79, the dog became still and quiet as the object approached. Sound is reported in roughly 50 per- cent of the sightings for both alert/alarm and fearful, but there is a difference in the quality of sound reported. The interesting point about the de- scriptions of UFO sounds is that of 16 sightings with sound and with dogs in alarm mode, only one sound was de- scribed specifically as high pitched, and that description came from an indepen- dent witness who was not with the dog. In contrast, among the 12 sightings reporting sound and fearful dogs, sound was specifically described as high pitched seven times. Sound and pain Individual dogs differ greatly in their response to sound. For instance, pricked-eared dogs are more sensitive to sound. The temperament of the dog also has influence. At my house, a loud, unusual sound brings our Jack Russell Terrier ripping in to investigate, while our Rat Terrier flattens herself to the ground until she looks the situation over. The Rat Terrier loves to howl with me if I use a high, long note imitating a wolf howl, whereas the Jack Russell is totally unimpressed. But the Jack Russell is slightly sound sensitive (i.e., shows fear) to thunder, and the Rat Ter- rier is oblivious to thunder. One rule will not fit all, but some sightings strongly suggest that high-pitched sounds are potentially 12 MUFON UFO Journal December 2005"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"painful to at least some dogs. In AR32, a domed disc 8 feet in di- ameter moved about a barnyard area at an altitude of 20 feet or less for 20 minutes during mid-day. The witness reported a penetrating high-pitched whine of such intensity that she felt it like a mild electric shock. Her dog was outdoors, cowering in the snow and trying to \"cover its ears with its paws,\" or possibly pawing at its ears because of discomfort. In AR33 a German Shepherd con- fined in the garage whined and whim- pered as though something was hurt- ing her as a dome-shaped object 20 feet in diameter moved about near the ground for over two hours with a high-pitched hum. Upon departure, its sound became much louder, and the Shepherd cried loudly. In AR44 the witness' dog ran \"yelp- ing\" to the house. The UFO, which then remained over the witness' head as he ran to the house, emitted a very high-pitched sound. The witness thought the dog reacted as it did be- cause the sound hurt its ears. \"Yelp- ing\" could indicate severe fear or pain, or both. In AR48 a dome-shaped UFO was observed one night, and strange high-pitched notes were heard. The next morning one of the witnesses was walking with her dog when she saw what appeared to be the same object (no comment on sound in the morning), and her dog yelped, pawed at its ears, would not move, and had to be carried back to the house. The description of this dog's behav- ior is compatible with sound causing pain and/or extreme fear. In contrast is AR50 where the dog was reacting to sound not reported as high-pitched, this dog was alert and in alarm mjode, but was not described as fearful. The family and a small pet dog were awakened in the night by an in- creasingly loud humming sound that became so loud it hurt human ears. This dog interspersed barking and howling with staring at the wall, but did not seem to be in discomfort. The wall staring is a typical attitude for a dog that is totally focused on listening.

Bramley looks at the UFO-like de- scriptions of key events in both the old and new testaments and sees the possi- bility that \"ancient astronauts\" played an important role. Others, such as MUFON consultant and author Barry Downing, have made simi- lar observations. But Bramley, who is also the author of The Gods of Eden, goes a step far- ther and makes use throughout the book of not only the old and new testaments, but also other documents that may pro- vide additional insights. In addition, he does not end the dis- cussion with the death of Christ, but continues with material on Christ's mother, Mary. The title of this book is somewhat unfortunate, as it suggests a non-schol- arly approach, and this is not the case. The tide comes from the manner in which the book is constructed. Each chapter is preceded by part of a continuing story in which it is imagined that Christ has returned to Earth in 2005, and is being questioned by media people to test his authenticity. This does serve to add interest, and is used to provide a reason for discussing the many theories regarding Christ. For example, the media person's 14 questions preceding the \"ancient astro- naut\" chapter is, \"Are we the only planet with intelligent life? Are we being vis- ited by aliens? If you're the son of God, then you would know.\" The modern day Christ answers, \"Do you think these questions are important to my mission?\" The media person says, \"I don't know. Maybe.\" Other chapters include\"A Man Who Never Was,\" \"Son of God & Savior,\" \"Apollonius of Tyana,\" \"The Mush- room,\" \"The Knowledge Giver,\" \"Aman Buried Beneath Myth,\" \"The Jew,\" \"The Essene,\" \"Egyptian Front Man,\" \"The Cynic,\" \"The Buddhist,\" \"The Druid,\" \"The Black Man,\" \"The Redhead,\" \"The Gay Man,\" \"Husband and Father,\" \"A Man of Uncertain Death,\" and \"The Con Artist.\" Brumley thus surveys all of the major alternative theories about Christ, and provides the pros and cons of each theory, utilizing specific evidence. He says he wrote the book \"because religion is a force for both good and bad that is having an enormous impact on our world right now.

It went i out of sight on the easterly horizon and made no noise. It took 15-20 seconds to cross my field of view, and did not look like a satellite, space station, or plane.\" Peter Davenport spoke at length with the witness, and we believe he prob- ably is quite credible. China dragon photo JILIN—At about 6 PM on Aug. 6, two students walked out of their library at Jilin University. A female student, Xiaobin, shouted, \"Look, a flying dragon is in the sky!\" Her boyfriend, Li, captured an im- age of the dragon on his picture phone, providing the second instance of photo documentation of a dragon flying over China so far this summer. In the middle of the photo is a distant dragon-shaped object, complete with four limbs and a tail. The dragon was a bright, gigantic animal-shaped object flying in the sky, heading southeast. It was incredibly dazzling, just like a dragon, according to the witnesses. -Skywatch International Crimea, Ukraine bright object SIMFEROPOL—On the evening of Sept. 8, 2005, Victor Alexandrovich Zdorov reportedly saw a UFO at 20:55 \\ December 2005 MUFON UFO Journal 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"hours while walking his dog near the center of Simferopol.

Anfalov Huge disc, strangeness in Nevada FALLON—The witness and his sis- ter were returning to their car at dusk on the east side of Lake Laotian in April of 2003 when they saw a huge object with red pulsating red lights on its side and a large red light on its top. It was flying across the desert at a very slow rate of speed, and no sound could be heard. \"This was a huge disk,\" said the wit- ness, \"less than an eighth of a mile from us. \"It could be clearly seen as it moved slowly just above the high voltage tow- ers that ran along the dirt road where we were parked. \"We watched it move across the tops of the few houses for about five min- utes. I'm not sure what happened to it, but it seems to have just gone into the mountain, or perhaps into the lake it- self, I'm not sure. \"This whole sighting lasted about 30 minutes, and we waited for about an- other half hour to see if it would ap- pear again. \"A week later we went out to the same place, hoping to see it again. There was no UFO, but we watched a car driving from house to house, park- ing around the backs of nine houses for a few minutes, then going on to the next place. \"When he got to the tenth and last house he set up a bright green light, and placed it in the front yard of the last house. It lit up the entke place, and I could not for the life of me figure out what the heck he was doing or what the light was. \"He left the light in this front yard and got back into his car and drove over to the last house on the right, which is where the UFO seemed to disappear, and he got out of his car and produced 16 a huge red light which glowed so bright I at first thought he had set fire to the house. \"Both lights glowed for about 1/2 hour or so and then went out. We left soon after the lights went out and never saw anything more. \"To this day I still wonder if I really did see what I thought I saw. If you go out to this same place today you will find it all but deserted, and the houses empty, like a ghost town. \"I would like to know what hap- pened to all the people, but another part of me doesn't really want to know.\" Thanks to ToniR. Elvis Presley's UFO encounter According to Michael Luckman, \"The home where Elvis was born in Tupelo, MS, was visited by a strange blue light when the King of Rock & Roll entered this world. \"Elvis told his friends, 'I'm not of this world.' He had several UFO sightings that he describes. \"Elvis reported, 'We were away from the campfire (in the desert), and we saw this light in the sky moving weird, you know, not like a plane or anything like it. '\"And it was different looking than a plane. It got brighter, and was com- ing closer. Hell, it was way up there, but we could see it on account of the moon and the way it was lit up. '\"It was cigar-shaped, oblong and rounded, and had some window port- holes on one end, and had lights along the bottom, but the damn thing had no wings, no means of being up there at all that we could see.' \"Elvis continued, 'Well we were watching it and the guys at camp started hollering because they all saw it too. And then we all ran to each other and got quiet when we heard the sound it made. '\"It was like electricity buzzing and a metallic sound, not like any engine we ever heard, and then it got kinda over us, still high, mind you, but up there over us. '\"Our hair began to prickle.

Large rectangle in Tennessee GREEN COUNTY—Three wit- nesses who are well-educated and life- long astronomers report that on the night of Sept. 5, 2005, they witnessed a large rectangular object hovering near Interstate 81. The primary witness reported that he, his wife, and a college friend were stargazing. They were equipped with a reflector telescope and a pair of bin- oculars. The witness stated that as he scanned the low horizon to his south, he real- ized he was seeing a very dark rectan- gular object with a small greenish blue luminescence being emitted from each corner of the object from underneath. He could not see a light as the object hovered horizontally and occasionally would wobble and rotate slowly. The shape was nearly rectangular and very thin, 25-1, flat. The object was likely hundreds of feet in diameter, filling 1/4 of the field of view in the binoculars.

McClelland, former ScO, Space Shuttle Fleet, Kennedy Space Center, FL (1958-1992), writes, \"Ev- ery generation has the obligation to free men's minds for a look at new worlds, and to look out from a higher plateau than the last generation. \"Astronaut Lt. Col. Ellison Onizuka, USAF, who died in the fateful launch of the space shuttle Challenger on Jan. 28,1986, was one of several members of the crew that I had the honor and pleasure of sharing conversations with. \"During one of the many pre-mis- sion preps for the Challenger mission, I came upon Lt. Col. Onizuka in the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) at launch complex 39. \"Many astronauts at the KSC knew of my interest in the study of possible ET intelligence. Another evening, while off-site, I once again accidentally came upon Ellison. He asked if I could give him an opinion regarding a topic that was sparking his curiosity. \"Ellison had a great interest in ET life, and asked me my belief concern- ing aliens, and if I believed they have been here on Earth. His question caught me by surprise. \"As we walked slowly, I briefly re- lated what I knew regarding the Roswellcase. Onizuka asked me if my surname had any connection with McClellan Air Force Base in Califor- nia? I said not as far as I was aware. I asked him why he asked. \"He said he had a surprising experi- ence, along with other USAF pilots, while on military training duty at McClellan, about eight or nine years prior to his astronaut training. \"He and this group were at this base for specialized training when they were directed to report to a viewing room. As they were seated, the room dark- ened and a movie began without the usual official introduction by a USAF officer. \"They were all startled when a view December 2005 of a facility similar to a medical exami- nation room appeared on the screen, and small bodies were observed lying on slabs. He heard several excited com- ments by the other officers seated near him. \"The small, strange-looking crea- tures were humanoid in shape, and ap- peared similar to those described by alleged witnesses at the well-known Roswell site in 1947. They all had large heads, large eyes, slight torsos, arms, and legs. They did not appear to be of earthly origin. \"Ellison then said, 'Clark, my God, these highly trained officers and I were shocked by what we saw. We were not made privy to what we would see until it happened. We were all caught off guard. Perhaps it was a test of our psyche to determine our overall reac- tion. Well, we were all caught by sur- prise.'\" Thanks to Clark C. McClelland and Sky watch International. Note: Several Air Force officers have told me they also saw this movie.

We thought there might be two objects. \"We left and noticed it was moving behind the trees. Then, after a few min- utes, the object flew over the trees right behind us, moving left and right as it disappeared. \"It was blinking red the last time we saw it.

MUFON UFO Journal Noisy UFO reported over British city A noisy UFO woke Birch Hill, UK, residents in the early hours of Oct. 10 when it zoomed over the sleeping sub- urb. The craft spent half-an-hour hover- ing above houses in Jevington before zipping towards South Hill Park, ac- cording to witnesses. \"Susan Mallia, who called The Mid- week to see if anyone else reported the strange sight, said, \"I have never seen anything like that before. It looked like a pile of scaffolding with lights-red, blue, and orange ones. \"It also had a big spotlight that was moving around. I don't think it was a helicopter because it sounded like a vacuum cleaner or a generator. \"It was very noisy, and it would have awakened everyone in the area. It woke me at 2:30 AM, and my husband and I watched it for half an hour. Just as he went to get his camera, it headed off to South Hill Park and was out of sight, but we could still hear it.\" This report is one of many over the past few weeks, with sightings coming from the Coppid Beech Hotel (July 7), Birch Hill (July 14), Crown Wood (July 19), Binfield and College Town (July 28) and another in Binfield (Aug. 30).

Irizarry wants the facility to be built with private funds to attract tourists. A green sign in southwestern Puerto Rico already proudly displays a silhou- ette of a flying saucer and two words: \"Extraterrestrial Route,\" for Route 303. \"It's a very mysterious place,\" said Irizarry, who claims he once saw red lights zigzagging above the hills.

Friedman Sir Martin Rees Sir Martin Rees (1942—) is one of the world's foremost authorities on many different aspects of astrophysics: black holes, quasars, gamma ray bursts, the formation of galaxies, etc. The universe is his beat. He is the Astronomer Royal of England, and Royal Society Research Professor at Cambridge University. This year he was elected president of the Royal So- ciety. He has published over 500 papers, written several books, and done much communication on subjects of interest to the public. Unfortunately, as with a number of other astronomers, he has also spoken out about UFOs and the search for aliens, despite his obvious ignorance of such matters. He contributed a guest column to the Times newspaper of London on Oct. 15, 2005. The title was a catchy \"Earth to Aliens: We haven't had a Signal Yet, Could you try Again?\" . He begins by reviewing the efforts to be made with new spacecraft to find some kind of life on Mars or beneath the ice on Europa. \"Could some of the planets orbiting other stars have life forms far more in- teresting and exotic than anything we might find on Mars? Could they even be inhabited by intelligent beings?\" So far so good. He went on: \"The claims that ad- vanced life is widespread must confront the question posed by Enrico Fermi, the great Italian physicist: if intelligent aliens were common, shouldn't they have visited us already? \"Why aren't they or their artifacts staring us in the face? Shouldn't we have seen so many UFOs that there's absolutely no doubt about them?\" (For those who examine the evi- dence, we Earthlings have indeed seen so many, and there is no doubt). Funny, we didn't believe that An- cient Troy had even existed until less than 150 years ago when Heinrich Stan Friedman Schliemann (1822-1890) discovered remnants down 75 feet in Turkey. The historians had said that stories about Troy were all Homeric myths and there had been no Troy. Schliemann used the \"myths\" to de- termine where to dig. The evidence was hardly staring us in the face. Very little of the surface of the Earth, especially under water, has been explored down 75 feet, and Troy existed just a few thousand years ago. Check out Yonagoni, under water near Japan; quite obvi- ously there had been a major city there a very long time ago. I switched to the University of Chi- cago in 1953 partly because Enrico Fermi was there. He had left Italy in 1938. Unfortunately he died in 1954. He was famous for using questions as teaching tools. The more accurate version of the so-called Fermi Paradox is that he and colleagues at Los Alamos Lab in New Mexico had a lunch dis- cussion in 1950 They agreed that it would take only a few million years to colonize the whole galaxy, once the technology started rolling. As they left, he asked the provocative question \"So where is everybody?\" Possible answers Whole books have been written about possible answers. These include: there is nobody else in the galaxy; they are all over, but we are being quaran- tined; they have bases here, on the other side of the moon, on a satellite of Jupi- ter or Saturn, in the asteroid belt, un- der the oceans here, etc. How about. \"We are a colony that was established millions of years ago and has ebbed and flowed. They have been visiting and the government knows all about it, but won't tell the public because of various military and political considerations. They are re- sponsible for those truly unexplainable UFO sightings.\" Rees goes on: \"But the fact that we haven't been visited doesn't imply that aliens don't exist. It would be far harder to traverse the mind-boggling distances of interstellar space than to transmit a signal. That's perhaps how aliens would reveal themselves first.\" Since when, in view of the over- whelming evidence to the contrary, is it a \"fact\" that we haven't been visited? I call that research by proclamation. Within a mere 55 light years of here there are 1,000 stars, of which about 46 are similar to the Sun. The galaxy is about 100,000 light years across, and the universe about 13.3 billio'n light years across. Not so mind-boggling What is mind-boggling about a mere 55 light years? Just down the street or around the corner. How much effort do we make to \"reveal\" ourselves to primi- tive societies here on earth, except for priests trying to proselytize and miners trying to plunder resources? Rees goes on: \"If we found such a signal, could we build up communica- tion? Intelligent aliens would probably be hundreds of light years away, or more. Can we communicate with be- ings whose messages may take hun- dreds, thousands, or even millions of years to reach us? There is no scope for snappy repartee.\" This is really silly. To discuss prob- ability one would need some notion of the distribution of ET civilizations. We have no data. Noting the relatively uniform distri- bution of stars in our local neighbor- hood, a sphere 550 light years in ra- dius instead of 55 should have about 20 MUFON UFO Journal December 2005"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"1,000 times as many stars, or about a million. Therefore, at least 50,000 would be suitable for planets and life. So by this kind of ludicrous thinking, we would be the only advanced civilization within that volume. And astrophysicists would be at the top of the heap, wouldn't they, because of their great knowledge of the universe. This, of course, ignores the simple fact that we have had advanced communi- cation technologies for only about 100 years. Either behind or ahead Everybody else in the neighborhood is either behind us, in which case they aren't emitting any signals, or at least 100 years ahead of us, in which case they are communicating using tech- niques about which we know nothing. The fact is that technological progress comes from doing things dif- ferently in an unpredictable fashion. We no longer use slide rules for comput- ing, or smoke signals for long distance communication. The most powerful signals we pro- duce that leave the earth are from mili- tary radar and a welter of TV and radio stations. Very soon our emissions will be enormously reduced because we will be sending much weaker signals up to satellites which will transmit them down to receivers on earth. We will go dark. Astronomers know nothing about aeronautics or astronautics or the be- havior of societies or the development of advanced technologies. Those who do know are the tinkerers and engineers who built our airplanes and rockets despite the advice of astronomers. As a matter of fact, another Astrono- mer Royal, Sir Richard van der Riet Wooley, in January, 1956, stated, \"Space travel is utter bilge,\" less than two years before Sputnik. He had been as negative 20 years earlier when reviewing P.E. Cleator's Rockets in Space when he, in Nature (March 14,1936), stated, \"The whole procedure [of snooting rockets into space] presents difficulties of so fun- damental a nature that we are forced to dismiss the notion as essentially im- practicable, in spite of the author's in- sistent appeal to put aside prejudice and to recollect the supposed impossibility of heavier-than-air flight before it was actually accomplished.\" Apparently all those V-2 rockets blasting England during WW 2 made no impression. In a conversation with Carl Sagan, I had noted that a majority of engineers and scientists involved in Research and Development activities accept UFO re- ality. His response was, \"Well, engi- neers will believe anything.\" Wooley or Rees (or Sagan, for that matter) are hardly the ones to talk about impracticability. It is interesting to note that Rees, in a BBC News article May 31,2002, said he believed that aliens could exist, pos- sibly as balloon-like creatures floating in dense atmospheres.\" He said that at- tempts to find them had suffered from \"flakey associations with UFOs.\" Methinks the astronomers are the flakes in this instance. To illustrate, he said, \"We should stop transmitting messages to outer space, and instead, listen for signals from super intelligent computers in the forms of strings of prime numbers or digits.\" Sure. Turn off all the radio and TV stations and radar antennas. Obviously Rees would be an expert on alien com- puters. Rees was then more ready to accept nearby aliens as he said, \"You might find intelligent life so far away that signals take maybe 10 or 20 years [to get here].\" In three years they have moved 10-20 times as far away!! The SETI nonsense I have written before about the non- sense espoused by the Silly Effort To Investigate (SETT) community. Here is a useful comment from H. Bauer, the editor of the Journal of the Society for Scientific Exploration: \"It is not uncommon for engineers to accept the reality of phenomena that are not yet understood, as it is very com- mon for physicists to disbelieve the re- ality of phenomena that seem to con- tradict contemporary beliefs of phys- ics.\" From a more philosophical, but very relevant, viewpoint I am very im- pressed by this comment by Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910): \"I know that most men, including those at ease with problems of the great- est complexity, can seldom accept even the simplest and most obvious truth if it be such as would oblige them to ad- mit the falsity of conclusions which they have delighted in explaining to col- leagues, which they have proudly taught to others, and which they have woven, thread by thread, into the fab- ric of their lives.\" In simpler terms, I also appreciate this comment by the great jazz musi- cian, Louis Armstrong (1901-1971): \"There are some people that if they don't know, you can't tell them.\" He must have known a few astro- physicists. fsphys@rogers.com www.stantonfriedman.com Ex-Canadian official says UFOs important On Sept. 25, Paul Hellyer, former Canadian Deputy Prime Minister un- der Trudeau, and former Canadian Minister for National Defense, gave a speech in Toronto at an event titled: \"Exopolitics Toronto.\" Hellyer discussed what he called \"some of the most profoundly impor- tant policy questions that must be ad- dressed,\" suggesting that governments should be dealing more effectively with UFOs. He described his time as Minister for Defense from 1963-1967 when the oc- casional UFO sighting report crossed his desk. He said that at that time he never have had time for what he con- sidered to be a \"flight of fancy,\" but nevertheless retained an interest in the UFO phenomenon. He described a personal UFO sight- ing he had with family and guests, but again attributed it to a \"flight of fancy.\" Hellyer's position on UFOs dramati- cally changed after watching the late Peter Jennings documentary special, \"Seeing is Believing\" in February, read- ing Col. Philip Corso's The Day After Roswell, and meeting with a retired United States Air Force general who reportedly verified Corso's claims. (For Hellyer's speech go to: www.checktheevidence.com/video/). December 2005 MUFON UFO Journal 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Director's Message (Continued from page 2) The main thrust of the Pandora Project is the conversion of paper cop- ies of UFO reports into an electronic database that will be archived for data mining and analysis. Each report must be prepared for the process and assigned a case number so computers can find it again wherever it is located in the data base. Then the reports are scanned and indexed and quality assurance performed. More than 4,000 cases, consisting of 42,000 pages, have been completed. That may sound like a lot of material, but we have only begun the process. MUFON Journal We continue to produce a high qual- ity monthly MUFON UFO Journal that is sent on-schedule to all MUFON members each month. While other publications are disappearing from the market at an ever increasing rate, our Journal just gets better and better. Special research report For the first time in several years, MUFON was able to publish a special research report. It documents the valu- able research work with animals done by Joan Woodward. It is entitled: Animal Reactions to UFOs: A Preliminary Investigation from the Animal's Perspective, and is available from MUFON Headquarters (see page 23). We plan to publish more special reports of this nature. MUFON & the Internet The MUFON website located at www.mufon.com is receiving a lot of hits, and the MUFON store is quite popular. The distribution for the free MUFON E-news bulletin has reached more than 3,000 addresses per issue, so we are now looking at increasing the number of issues per year. International Symposium MUFON has held an International UFO Symposium and published the proceedings of the event every year since 1971. The 2005 symposium held in Denver in July was an exciting, in- teresting, and successful event. We are already working on the next symposium, featuring \"The Best Evi- dence.\" It will be held at the Marriott Tech Center Hotel in Denver on July 14-16, 2006. Lifetime Members growing Our cadre of lifetime members con- tinues to grow. By becoming lifetime members they demonstrate their confi- dence in MUFON. Entertainment & media support MUFON has received valuable help from our members working in the en- tertainment and media fields. Rang- ing from radio and TV show produc- ers and hosts to television and movie entertainers, MUFON is proud that they are willing to speak out about UFOs and the importance of the work done by MUFON. We appreciate their support. Our Directors We especially want to thank our dedicated cadre of State Directors, Assistant State Directors, State Section Directors, Regional and National Di- rectors, and Foreign Representatives for their excellent valuable work. They oversee the collection and in- vestigation of UFO reports, recruit new members, conduct field investigator training sessions, sponsor public meet- ings, and act as the local interface with newspapers, radio/TV stations, educa- tional institutions, and the public.

McLeod January 2006 Moon Phases Last Quarter: Jan. 3 New Moon: Jan. 10 First Quarter: Jan. 17 Full Moon: Jan. 25 Bright Planets (Evening Sky) Mercury (magnitude -0.8): Moving from Sagittarius into Capricornus. For observers in both hemispheres. Mer- cury will be visible low in the west just before sunset, but will become lost in the glare of the Sun as the month progresses Venus (magnitude -4.0): In Sagit- tarius. Venus will be shining brightly low in the west-southwest before sun- set on New Years Day. Venus will be- come lost to sight as it drops into the glare of the Sun around the 9 th or 10 lh of the month. Venus will reemerge before sunrise around the 21 st of the month, and will rise higher and higher in the sky as the month progresses. For southern hemisphere observers Venus will become'visible by the 19 th in the early morning twilight. Mars (magnitude -0.6 to 1.3): In Aries. Mars will be shining brightly high in the southeast after dusk. Mars will slowly fade as the Earth leaves it behind. For southern hemisphere observers, Mars will stand about 45 degrees high on the meridian at the end of evening twilight and will set near 2 AM in the west-northwest. Saturn: (magnitude -0.6): In Can- cer. Saturn will be low in the east in the early evening after sunset. As the month of January passes, Saturn will rise higher in the sky. Saturn will be brighter than usual this month as it will be at its closest point to the earth. Saturn and its rings will be a spectacular object with telescopes or binoculars. For southern hemisphere observers Saturn will rise near 8:30 p.m. in the east-northeast and will stand approxi- mately 25 degrees high at the begin- ning of morning twilight. Bright Planets (Morning Sky Jupiter (magnitude -2.0 to -2.1): In Libra. On New Years morning Jupiter will rise in the east near 3 AM, and around 1 AM by month's end. By the time dawn breaks, Jupiter will be shining brightly high in the south- east. For southern hemisphere observers, Jupiter will rise near 1:45 AM in the east-northeast and will stand more than 53 degrees high in the east at the be- ginning of morning twilight Other Celestial Phenomena Meteor Showers: Quadrantids The Quadrantids are an above aver- age shower, with up to 40 meteors per hours at their peak. The shower will peak this year on Jan. 3, but some me- teors will be visible Dec. 28-Jan. 7. Best viewing will be from a dark lo- cation after midnight on the morning of the 4th. Look to the northeast just after midnight to 1 AM. The crescent moon will set early, en- suring a dark sky for an optimal per- formance! Predicted Rate: 45 and 200 faint meteors per hour. Where To Look: east of Polaris (the North Star) and below Ursa Major (the big dipper). Planetary Conjunction Before dawn on Jan. 15, the Moon and Saturn will present a spectacular sight in the predawn sky. Planetary conjunctions, especially when the brighter planets and/ or stars are involved, can be a source of sightings reports as observers unfamil- iar with the night sky notice the group- ing of bright lights in the sky. Conjunctions and Occultations: Jan. 8: Mars 1.3 degrees south of the Moon. Jan. 15: Saturn 4.0 degrees south of the Moon. 24 MUFON UFO Journal December 2005"}]
