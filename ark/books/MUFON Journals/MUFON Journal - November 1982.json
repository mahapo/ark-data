FROM THE EDITOR As another year draws to an end it is questionable whether we are any nearer to a solution to the UFO mystery; indeed, the \"strangeness\" of reports continues to increase, and no simple or neat theory has surfaced to draw all the threads together. Clearly IFOs (as Oberg, Hendry, and many of us before them have demonstrated) confuse the issue. \"UFOlogy,\" in general, is chaotic and disorganized, lacking the resources and full-time talent to do the subject justice. On the positive side, 1982 has seen a spirit of growing cooperation and sharing of resources, nationally and internationally. More and more well-qualified people from a wide range of scientific and professional backgrounds have become activists in MUFON or other leading groups, and some worthwhile investigations and •original research has resulted. Better organization, more resources (including talent), a more critical and analytical attitude....all of these are needed if we hope to make progress in 1983.

Schuessler A report on \"Pentagonal UFOs\" was published in the October 1981 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal, covering an accumulation of cases from across the country; but stimulated by the reports of two pentagonal-shaped objects seen near the city of Houston, Texas. I have received additional material from other researchers since the origninal material was published. That material will be summarized in this report. In the October 1979 issue of the New England UFO Newsletter, Joe Nyman described a pentagonal object observed by two newsmen in Bristol County, Massachusetts. The event occurred at 7:25 p.m. on March 23, 1979. The two witnesses were Gerald Lopes.and Steve Sbracci. They first observed the object as .a light that would hover and then move ahead. When they finally parked their car and got out, the object moved directly. overhead at approximately 1000 feet. They said it was shaped like home plate at a ball park, with a white light on the front, a red light on either side, and a series of smaller lights on the rear. The object was the size of a standard car and solid — it blocked out the.stars as it passed overhead. They said the bottom of the object was brownish-black. The witnesses contacted the FAA at Logan Airport and the South Weymouth Air Base. Neither facility could give a clue as to the identity of the object. Mr. Nyman verified that the advertising airplanes were not flying in the area at that time. The October 1979 issue of the Tarheel UFO Study Group Newsletter described the sighting of a hexagonal object near Charlotte on March 5,1979 at 11:45 p.m. The object was seen by two women and one of the women's 15- year-old son. The following is a quotation from the newsletter. \"They noticed what at first appeared to be an airplane heading toward them in a southeasterly direction. At first two bright white lights were visible, but as it suddenly turned toward them and descended as it approached they could see several white lights. It passed from left to right over the car. Curious, they stopped the car. They looked behind them to see the UFO hovering over a substation a few hundred feet away. Lattice runs and tank-like structures were visible along a metallic hexagonal center. They estimated the object to be longer than a 747 jet.\" The Northfield, Minn., News reported the sighting of a hexagonal object in the August 20, 1981 issue of the newspaper. The report described the . sighting at 3:30 a.m. Monday, August 10, by Russel Matson. He first observed the object as two lights about 1,000 feet away. He stopped the car and got out as the object was 400 to 500 feet away and about 1,000 feet in altitude. Then, he claimed the object turned and came directly overhead. He said \"it was a perfect image. It was nothing I've ever seen before.\" He described the object as having a hexagon shape with a span of 60 to 90 feet and about 15 feet thick. He described the small sound as whooshing like gas escaping a propane tank. The object had two green lights on one side and two red lights on the other. It had white lights close together on the front and back. The speed of the object was 10 to 15 mph. Matson viewed the object for 40 to 50 seconds. Tom Benson (The Sixth Quark Journal) provided two octagonal UFO cases from the pages of the Flying Saucer Review. At 9:00 p.m. on May 31, 1975, Mrs. Fry and her husband were driving through London. They stopped the car and got out to watch an octagonal object with two silver lights on a crossbar cross the area. It was completely silent. They said it was moving very slowly when it went out and vanished completely. (Flying Saucer Review, Vol. 22, No. 4, 1976). At 6:10 p.m. on January 23, 1976, Shelley Barnes was returning home RED -> LIGHT X<> WHITE LIGHT RED LIGHT SMALLER WHITE LIGHTS Mar. 23, 1979; Bristol County, Mass. WHITE LIGHTS WHITE LIGHTS Aug. 10, 1981; IMorthfield, Minn. May 31,1975; London, England near the Rumsworth Lodge Reservoir in Bolton, England, when she became aware of a light over the reservoir. At first it was just a red light, then it streaked toward her and hovered just about roof-top level. The object was octagonal, with two large lights on the front. One was a steady amber and the other a flashing red. She said the object began to rotate on its axis and she felt her teeth begin to vibrate as if some ultrasonic sound was emanating from the object. (Flying Saucer Review, Vol. 22, No. 1, 1976). The January 21, 1981 issue of the Kent Evening Post, Maidstone, England, reported the sighting of an (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Unusual UFOs, Continued octagonal-shaped object on January 2, 1981 at Petworth, England. The witness, Peter Langridge, is a television scriptwriter. He and his 15-year-old son said \"the thing was dark, but a deeper dark than the night and it had lights around it — they were yellow and created a haze rather than a beam, rather like disco lights.\" The object appeared to be reverberating. The word he used to describe the effect was \"purring,\" but there was no audible sound. Heather Chinigo and Judy Gudaitis experienced a close encounter near Killingly, Conn., on August 25, 1981, at 9:15 p.m. They first noticed two bright lights. They said the lights were square and in the glimmer of the light they could see an object that was shaped like a lopsided stop sign. They said the object followed them when they turned and drove different directions (Norwich, Conn., Bulletin, August 27, 1981). Theresa Schmidt and her three children saw an octagonal-shaped object about 10:00 p.m. on August 18, 1981. They said it hovered about 100 feet over the driveway. It was the size of two cars. It appeared to be 20-25 feet in diameter, with red and green flashing lights. No sound was detected (Sandstone, Minn., Pine County Courier, September 3, 1981). Square objects are being reported also. Ellida Dempeter of Bromley, England reported a square object about 9:00 p.m. on May 21, 1981. She said: \"I looked to my left and saw a great white, bright light. It seemed like a cluster of lights, but it came over as one big light. It was above the house and looked square.\" (Kent, England, Bromley Times, May 28, 1981). A Westerfield, Ind., couple spotted what they called \"a square-like object, whitish in appearance, with red and green lights shining upward, forming a crescent-like shape.\" It was September 25, 1981, when the couple saw the object 300 feet above the ground just below the clouds. They said it hovered and then moved slowly, like drifitng, to the north, where it finally disappeared over a wooded area. (Westerfield, Ind., Enterprise, Sept. 30, 1981). 4 Tracy Schey and Dennis Bailey NEW ZEALAND ENTITY REPORTS By Keith Basterfield While much has been written on Australian entity cases, little has been heard of similar events in New Zealand. Although several excellent publications have come out of that country over the years, for some reason entity reports have not featured very prominently in world-wide UFO journals.. New Zealand lies between 33-53° South, about 1600 km East of Australia and has a population of about 3.2 million people spead over 270,000 square km (about the same size as the British Isles). My research to date has uncovered 18 entity cases for the whole country. These figures might best be compared with our fairly thoroughly researched 87 Australian cases from a- population of some 15 million over 7,700,000 square km or with the number of recorded global entity accounts which have reached 2,100. In order to rectify the lack of information around, I present a brief summary of the cases I located. The references shown following each abstract are the most original one which I can locate. Further references are available from the author of those interested in pursuing the matter further. 30 July 1909, Gore, OSOOhrs: Two mail dredgehands viewed an \"airship\" at close range. The ship lowered through mist and circled around. Two figures were plainly visible sitting on board. It was carrying lights at both ends. Finally it shot upwards and left to the southeast. (Auckland Weekly News, Aug. 5, 1909) Later than July 1909, Port Molyneux: An airship is said to have alighted and occupants who looked \"Japanese\" emerged and engaged a male onlooker in conversation. (Unknown 1909 issue of Olutha Free Press) 3 Aug. 1909, Waipawa, Night: A (continued on next page) observed a square-shaped UFO over Olympia, Wash., on June 15, 1982. They were in their car when they saw some lights in front and above them. Bailey told his step-brother, \"UFO at 10 o'clock.\" He said it was cruising along, going due east. The object had two large lights, one on top, the other on the bottom, but there were many more small flashing lights. The size was larger than a 747 jumbo jet. The huge square- shaped thing flew at an altitude of 1,000 to 2,000 feet. Bailey said it reminded him of a \"lighted oil derrick.\" A \"flying cheese wedge\" was sighted over Mt. Washington, N.H. about 9:00 p.m. on March 22,1982. The details of the incident are sparce, but the witnesses are described as credible. Unusual shapes are puzzling, but continue to be reported. Some of the witnesses are people with flying experience; others work for the media and are well versed in investigative techniques. The repeated reports of two lights on the objects force the investigator to consider, the possibility that aircraft landing lights are Mar. 22,1982; Mt. Washington, IM.H. responsible; however in many of the cases airport and FAA personnel have verified the absence of aircraft traffic. The repeated reports of red and green lights resemble the running lights on aircraft; but the witnesses are often directly below the low-flying objects and have a clear view of the shape — definitely not that of an aircraft as we know it. It would be easy to pass these sightings off as misidentified aircraft; but this would be giving an answer for the sake of having an answer to close out the file. I'd rather have a positive identification in each case; otherwise it is better to leave it open to speculation. (Additional reports should be sent to John F. Schuessler, P.O.

Then 4-6 tall figures \"floated\" down some nearby sandhills and approached them. They were clothed from top to bottom in black, with no visible face, arms or feet. A large dense-grey balloon (1.2 m diameter) with a flat bottom suddenly appeared only some 1 m away, at eye level. They turned and ran.

One lady (B) was hypnotized and recounted waking at 1 a.m. to find a light shining in her eyes. A disc with dome was hovering nearby. Two of them were drawn along the beam of light to the object while the third lay asleep. B next recalled being inside a small, round room. A humanoid was present of average height, dressed in off-white overalls and white boots. A non-verbal conversation ensued. The ladies were then returned by the beam. The object left at speed.

Two humanoids were carrying off one of his dogs. They were 143 cm tall wearing close-fitting metallic silver overalls, and white opaque helmets. - The overalls were gathered at the ankles with elastic cuffs which extended over red glowing boots. On their hands were large silver gauntlets with flared arm coverings extending halfway up the forearms. The farmer fired a shot and apparently winged one of the entities. The craft took off at speed. Footprints were reportedly found. (Xeno/og, issue unknown) 8 Dec. 1977, Waimata Valley: A man reported seeing an entity standing by the side of the road.

Oberg, all rights reserved) It would be strange if nobody at all in the West noticed the connection between the Soviet FOBS spacecraft tests and UFOs. In fact, many classified intelligence analysts (with the CIA, DIA, or NSA) probably did make the connection, and thus were able to extract valuable technical intelligence data about FOBS weapon performance from \"UFO reports\" published so innocently by Zigel and other Soviet flying saucer buffs of the brief 1967-68 UFO wave. Such top secret analyses were even more useful insofar as Soviet military counterintelligence agencies were unaware of them — the old spy's trick of \"We know, but they don't know we know, and we know that they don't know we know....\" (And if the Soviets found out, they would cut off any further flows of similarly useful information.) This plausible scenario provides one reasonable explanation of why the U.S. government really should be interested in UFO reports, precisely because they are not \"true UFOs\" but instead are something else of much greater interest to the agencies in question. Furthermore, the results of these \"UFO studies\" would necessarily have to remain highly classified. Thus, no \"true UFOs\" need to be involved to explain government secrecy about some UFO reports it has been interested in. That interpretation is supported by a remarkable NSA document obtained by UFO researchers via the Freedom of Information Act. Written in 1968, the anonymous document discusses various angles of the UFO problem and possible hypotheses to explain it. \"Many responsible military officers have developed a mental 'blind spot' to objects which appear to have the characteristics of UFOs,\" the paper perceptively warned (such a 'blind spot' is precisely the thing which the Soviets hoped to exploit by painting their space tests as UFOs). One of five explanations for UFOs was that \"Some UFOs are secret Earth projects,\" and in that case,- \"Undoubtedly, all UFOs should be carefully scrutinized to ferret out such enemy projects.\" Analysts who followed this valuable advice may well have been able to \"ferret out\" the secrets behind the 1967 Soviet UFO wave, but if they did, no such records have yet been declassified. (Meanwhile, this particular NSA document has been identified as a totally unofficial study paper written unsolicited, by an NSA employee with a private interest in UFOs — and hence it evidently had absolutely no influence on NSA policy towards the UFO question.) Did Gindilis know the truth behind the bulk of his raw UFO data from Zigel (data which, by the way, have been shown to be quite accurate due to their high correlation with confirmable visual stimuli such as the FOBS entries)? That question remains unanswered but there are several arguments for both points of view, innocence or deception. In December 1981 a group of. American astronomers went to Tallinn, Estonia, in the Soviet Union, for a major conference on SETI (despite the lack of (continued on next page) N.Z. Entity, Continued shaped, silver in color and glowing. A doorway opened and a tall figure stood there, apparently 2 to 2.3 m in height. The witness waved to the entity, who waved back. The door then closed and the object rose and left. (Rodney & Waitemata Times, Feb. 1, 1978) 2 Apr. 1978, East Coast Bays Road, 2030 hrs: Ms. Robinson was riding a motorcycle when she noticed a wedge_shape with lights on it. It stopped about 200 m away. There were two figures clearly visible peering at her. These were visible from the waist up and seemed to be wearing dark robes. A car appeared after several minutes and the object moved away. (Auckland Star, Apr. 3, 1978) 11 July 1981, Dunedin, 1815 hrs: An 82-year-old woman reported seeing a football-shaped object in an adjacent paddock. It glowed and pulsated, had a light on its lower half which was as bright as a searchlight. Two entities were clearly visible within it. One appeared to be piloting from a clear glass cabin in the nose while the other was .standing in a central glass tube which extended beyond the top of the object. Both were dressed in grey coveralls, had white skin and no hair. The lady called her son who also watched for a while. (John Knapman, Christchurch) Looking over the events unearthed, it is surprising, or perhaps not, that four cases come from the early part of the century. Readers will probably recall the large number of \"airships\" reported over New Zealand in 1909, and like U.S. counterparts of earlier years, that entities were part of the scene. The spectacular 1959 Blenheim observation came just 16 days after the well known Papua sightings of Rev Gill et al, and it is as interesting as any of our Australian events. Then followed a range of reports from those of entities walking along side roads to a possible abduction (more than we've had in Australia up until now). Although in general, cases are similar to Australian ones, the odd one of a farmer shooting \"dognappers\" might just be a little difficult for some researchers to swallow. If any of our New Zealand readers know of other cases I would appreciate hearing of them. (Author's address: 3 Park Lake Drive, Wynn Vale, South Australia 5127.)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"N.Z.

A humanoid was present of average height, dressed in off-white overalls and white boots. A non-verbal conversation ensued. The ladies were then returned by the beam. The object left at speed. The second lady refused to be hypnotized. (Strangers in Our Skies, Dykes, INL Print, Wellington 1981, pp. 46-49) 2 Dec. 1977, Waimata, 0300 hrs: Awakened by his dogs a farmer investigated, to find a \"saucer\" on the ground. Two humanoids were carrying off one of his dogs. They were 143 cm tall wearing close-fitting metallic silver overalls, and white opaque helmets. The overalls were gathered at the ankles with elastic cuffs which extended over red glowing boots. On their hands were large silver gauntlets with flared arm coverings extending halfway up the forearms. The farmer fired a shot and apparently winged one of the entities. The craft took off at speed. Footprints were reportedly found. (Xenolog, issue unknown) 8 Dec. 1977, Waimata Valley: A man reported seeing an entity standing by the side of the road. The entity was 145 cm tall in a silver suit with no helmet, and bright red boots.

Oberg, all rights reserved) It would be strange if nobody at all in the West noticed the connection between the Soviet FOBS spacecraft tests and UFOs. In fact, many classified intelligence analysts (with the CIA, DIA, or NSA) probably did make the connection, and thus were able to extract valuable technical intelligence data about FOBS weapon performance from \"UFO reports\" published so innocently by Zigel and other Soviet flying saucer buffs of the brief 1967-68 UFO wave. Such top secret analyses were even more useful insofar as Soviet military counterintelligence agencies were unaware of them — the old spy's trick of \"We know, but they don't know we know, and we know that they don't know we know....\" (And if the Soviets found out, they would cut off any further flows of similarly useful information.) This plausible scenario provides one reasonable explanation of why the U.S. government really should be interested in UFO reports, precisely because they are not \"true UFOs\" but instead are something else of much greater interest to the agencies in question. Furthermore, the results of these \"UFO studies\" would necessarily have to remain highly classified. Thus, no \"true UFOs\" need to be involved to explain government secrecy about some UFO reports it has been interested in. That interpretation is supported by a remarkable NSA document obtained by UFO researchers via the Freedom of Information Act. Written in 1968, the anonymous document discusses various angles of the UFO problem and possible hypotheses to explain it. \"Many responsible military officers have developed a mental 'blind spot' to objects which appear to have the characteristics of UFOs,\" the paper perceptively warned (such a 'blind spot' is precisely the thing which the Soviets hoped to exploit by painting their space tests as UFOs). One of five explanations for UFOs was that \"Some UFOs are secret Earth projects,\" and in that case, \"Undoubtedly, all UFOs should be carefully scrutinized to ferret out such enemy projects.\" Analysts who followed this valuable advice may well have been able to \"ferret out\" the secrets behind the 1967 Soviet UFO wave, but if they did,' no. such records have yet been declassified. (Meanwhile, this particular NSA document has been identified as a totally unofficial study paper written unsolicited, by an NSA employee with a private interest in UFOs — and hence it evidently had absolutely no influence on NSA policy towards the UFO question.) Did Gindilis know the truth behind the bulk of his raw UFO data from Zigel (data which, by the way, have been shown to be quite accurate due to their high correlation .with confirmable visual stimuli such as the FOBS entries)? That question remains unanswered but there are several arguments for both points of view, innocence or deception. In December 1981 a group of American astronomers went to Tallinn, Estonia, in the Soviet Union, for a major conference on SETI (despite the lack of (continued on next page) N.Z. Entity, Continued shaped, silver in color and glowing. A doorway opened and a tall figure stood there, apparently 2 to 2.3 m in height. The witness waved to the entity, who waved back. The door then closed'and the object rose and left. (Rodney & Waitemata Times, Feb. 1, 1978) 2 Apr. 1978, East Coast Bays Road, 2030 hrs: Ms. Robinson was riding a motorcycle when she noticed a wedge shape with lights on it. It stopped about 200 m away. There were two figures clearly visible peering at her. These were visible from the waist up and seemed to be .wearing dark robes. A car appeared after several minutes and the object moved away. (Auckland Star, Apr. 3, 1978) 11 July 1981, Dunedin, 1815 hrs: An 82-year-old woman reported seeing a football-shaped object in an adjacent paddock. It glowed and pulsated, had a light on its lower half which was as bright as a searchlight. Two entities were clearly visible within it. One appeared to be piloting from a clear glass cabin in the nose while the other was standing in a central glass tube which extended beyond the top of the object. Both were dressed in grey coveralls, had white skin and no hair. The lady called her son who also watched for a while. (John Knapman, Christchurch) Looking over the events unearthed, it is surprising, or perhaps not, that four cases come from the early part of the century. Readers will probably recall the large number of \"airships\" reported over New Zealand in 1909, and like U.S. counterparts of earlier years, that entities were part of the scene. The spectacular 1959 Blenheim observation came just 16 days after the well known Papua sightings of Rev Gill et al, and it is as interesting as any of our Australian events. Then followed a range of reports from those of entities walking along side roads to a possible abduction (more than we've had in Australia up until now). Although in general, cases are similar to Australian ones, the odd one of a farmer shooting \"dognappers\" might just be a little difficult for some researchers to swallow. If any of our New Zealand readers know of other cases I would appreciate hearing of them.

There, the Americans were surprised and dismayed to see how popular the UFO topic was among major Soviet scientific workers. \"The Tallinn conference was plagued with them,\" noted one attendee privately. \"It was interesting,\" he went on (off the record), \"that the senior Soviet scientists seemed to accept this as a normal occurrence at such a meeting. In fact, some of the papers from serious scientists referred to UFOs in quite an accepting way...There is no official attempt to suppress reports of UFOs.\" Referring to the infamous \"Petrozavodsk Jellyfish UFO\" of September 20, 1977 (.shown conclusively by my research to have been caused by a pre-dawn launching of the space spy satellite Cosmos-955 from the secret Plesetsk space center), the American continued: \"Several of the UFO fans approached us to discuss this event. It is clearly known widely and is clearly in the minds of Soviet UFO buffs the 'smoking gun' which proves the reality of UFOs.\" This must be entirely to the liking of Moscow's military security' specialists and news censors, who wish to hide the very existence of the Plesetsk rocket center — and the popular notion that the apparition was a \"flying saucer\" obviously takes the heat off the true explanation, that it was a secret military space launch (which Moscow claims it never carries out). (This Petrozavodsk UFO of 1977, a decade after the FOBS blitz, marked a new phase in soviet UFO consciousness. Ten years after the isolated first sighting of a Plesetsk launching, it was the start of a series of twilight satellite launchings from Plesetsk which were widely observed in Moscow and surrounding densely- populated regions of central Russia — and were misperceived as giant flying saucers. Other similar events occurred on June 14,1980 and May 15,1981. But it was the popular and widely publicized Petrozavodsk case alone which probably instigated both the Gindilis Report and a wider Soviet public awareness which prepared the way for subsequent \"UFO attacks\" set off GLOBAL VIEW OF SOVIET SPACE AND MISSILE ACTIVITY RESPONSIBLE FOR PSEUDO-UFO WAVES IN THE USSR, 1957-1981 (Left) (A) Tyuratam Space Center (a.k.a. \"Baikonur\"), launch site of FOBS warheads in 1966-1970 (B) Re-entry path of flame-shrouded FOBS warheads (always in Twilight), misperceived as \"current UFOs\".(pseudo-UFOs) (C) Plesetsk secret military space center, opened in 1966 (D) Trajectory of Plesetsk spy-satellite Cosmos-194, seen and misperceived as \"Kamennyy UFO\" (Dec. 3, 1967) (Right) (A) -Tyuratam Missile Center (B) Kamchatka impact range for ICBM tests, July-August 1957 (C) Retrograde polar orbit launchings over Iran, 1976-1980 (D) Plesetsk twilight launchings, 1977-1982 merely by sunlit rocket contrails in the sky.) As to Gindilis, those who know him classify him as \"obviously a very slick operator\" with important political functions. He is reportedly a very astute and shrewd careerist scientific bureaucrat, these same Western observers believe. On the other hand, the treatment of the 1967 UFO cases in the Gindilis Report (in sections written by Menkov) has all the appearance of genuine bafflement over their unique characteristics — and a deliberate coverup might be expected to gloss over these unique features, not highlight them. For example, Menkov wrote that \"In 1967, there was increased activity\" in the Northern Caucasus Donbass, and the Rostov region\" — and those areas are right along the groundtrack of returning FOBS warheads. \"The 1967 distribution is clearly asymmetrical,\" he continued. \"Movement in an easterly direction is prevalent.\" Additionally, \"A considerable fraction of the usually extremely rare crescent-like objects should be noted; this is associated with the peculiarities of 1967, which makes the main contribution to the sample under consideration,\" noted Menkov. \"Crescent-shaped objects ...usually move quite rapidly through the sky,\" Menkov continued. \"They frequently are accompanied by one or more starlike objects (burning fragments of the retro-rocket package)...In the summer of 1967, they were observed quite frequently over the southern parts of European USSR....(and) these objects represent an appreciable fraction of the study sample.\" But with all these obvious (in hindsight) clues staring them in the face, neither the Gindilis team nor any Western UFO experts followed up on them. It should be obvious by now that this \"crescent\" UFO apparition is a tip- off that such \"UFOs\" are almost certainly the shock waves associated with Soviet space vehicles, ones which the government does not want its citizens or the world to recognize. Menkov also tried to explain why there were so many cases in the data base from 1967 alone. \"The sharp increase in number evidently is associated with a Central Television appearance, in which the UFO phenomenon was discussed and (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Soviet Cover-Up, Continued reporting observations of similar phenomena was suggested. Similarly, a sharp drop in the number of reports after 1968 evidently is associated with critical statements in the central press (Pravda, 29 February 1968), in which the UFO problem was classified as unscientific.\" Actually, of course, the 1967 wave began and ended with the FOBS flurry. After eight launches that spring, summer, and fall, the program was cut way back; after October 28, there were no new flights until the following April (and that was a rare pre-dawn test), then an evening flight in October, then one a year later in September 1969, and finally two more in 1970. One may speculate that the dusk/dawn re-entry times for the FOBS test were designed to allow optical tracking of the warhead descent trajectories. Probably no consideration was given to the consequence that hundreds of thousands of people would also see the fireballs, and that the tests would give birth to the greatest UFO flap in Russian history — a UFO flap which would still be resounding 15 years later with the official blessing of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Admittedly, the notion that the Soviet government is deliberately manipulating public UFO enthusiasm in order to • cover up certain types of military space activity is a bizarre one. It also may credit Moscow propagandists with more finesse than they have demonstrated in the past. But such a tactic is not unprecedented. A good example of how the official Soviet press blatantly exploits the popular appeal of pseudo-scientific topics is the case of the \"ancient astronauts.\" This is the theory, once popular in the West but subsequently discredited, that visitors from other planets formerly meddled in the development of ancient civilizations on Earth and taught early societies many of the secrets of agriculture, medicine, astronomy, and technology. That theory continues to retain respectability and official sanction in the government-controlled Soviet media, as renowned scientists and authors speculate on the significance of ancient rock carvings, prehistoric Janpanese 'spacesuit' statues, Chinese myths, and miscellaneous artifacts. The utility of this belief in the official anti-religious crusade should be obvious: the notion that ancient religions were founded on ignorant misperceptions of extraterrestrial cosmonauts can be (and is) widely used to discredit church activity today. The fact that most scientists reject such theories as absurd, distorted, or even fabricated does not hinder their usefulness to cynical pro-atheism propagandists in the Soviet news industry. Whatever the manipulation being attempted in Moscow, a separate problem concerns Western UFO experts left holding the bag of the discredited Gindilis Report. Might something usable be salvaged from the wreckage of this hoax? It may be argued that the Gindilis Report can be \"rescued\" simply by eliminating all of the 1967 cases, thus purging the remaining data of the FOBS contamination. In fact, this tactic was used in the report itself when the west- to-east directionality so overwhelmed the motion statistics that the authors did separate studies for \"all cases\" and \"all non-1967 cases\" (which turned out to have a purely random directionality without the FOBS cases). But this hope is futile. The FOBS contamination is symptomatic of a worse flaw which permeates the report: all manner of technological activity, (aircraft operations, balloons, space missions in general) will successfully masquerade as UFOs in the USSR. They cannot do so as easily in the U.S.- because . information is generally available (as CUFOS investigations have shown); they cannot avoid doing so in the USSR because required information is routinely embargoed. A good example of this problem is a non-FOBS \"UFO\" seen from a Soviet astronomical observatory in the Caucasus Mountains (the description is from Zigel's article in \"Soviet Life\"): \"...a strange formation (was seen) against a clear starry sky at 2:50 a.m. A white cloud appeared in the northeast at an elevation of about 20 degrees. Its diameter was twice as long as that of the moon but its nose was several times less bright. The cloud itself had a dense milky-white color, with a rosy-red nucleus clearly discernible near its northern end. The cloud expanded and grew paler. A few minutes later the white cloud dispersed completely, but the reddish nucleus remained.\" This is obviously consistent with a view of a distant missile launching. In fact, the witness was looking directly toward the Kapustin Yar rocket range; if the UFO had been right over the range, at the given angular elevation it would have been about a hundred miles up, an entirely reasonable value for vertical rocket probes frequently launched from Kapustin Yar. But here is the rub: Soviet missile launching information is generally never published, so confirmation of the hypothesis is congenially impossible. A simple phone call would have identified the IFO in the US; the lack of such data in the USSR should not be considered sufficient evidence to prove the true UFO nature of this and similar accounts. Another example of the inherent impossibility of adequately investigating all Soviet UFO reports is the Kamchatka incident of July 25, 1957. Reportedly, air defense units'opened fire with anti-aircraft guns at a fleet of fast-moving UFOs. This case has been widely published in the West and even appeared in a book reportedly used at the Air Force Academy. The summer of 1957 was marked by the first flight tests of Russian SS-6 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) from the Tyuratam rocket center east of the Aral Sea. It is known that the flight path was aimed right toward the Kamchatka peninsula, with planned warhead splashdown in the Pacific just offshore. A major missile tracking site was built at Petropavlovsk. Range from Tyuratam was 4,100 miles. Initial launch attempts are known to have been made in mid-June and there were some failures. But by August 17, Moscow was able to announce this successful testing of an ICBM. A reasonable hypothesis for the Kamchatka UFOs is that they were caused by the reentry of one of the test warheads and associated booster (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Soviet Cover-Up, Continued fragments. The witnesses were certainly in the right spot to witness such a phenomenon that summer. Yet without official records of such a test occurring on July 25 (assuming that the date is accurate) a positive identification will never be possible. Soviet records are presumably inaccessible forever; U.S. records are probably incomplete and'are still mired in security regulations anyway. Under these circumstances, can the Kamchatka incident really be considered a \"true UFO\"? Obviously not. A reasonable approach would be to realize that the location, general date, and eyewitness descriptions are entirely consistent with the ICBM explanation. Further, to establish the \"true UFO\" nature of the event, a UFO proponent should be required to demonstrate why it could not have been an ICBM reentry — clearly an impossible task. Therefore, UFO skeptics could be entirely justified in assigning a \"probable ICBM reentry\" solution to this case even without precise records. It most definitely cannot be considered a \"true UFO\" when the burden of proof is properly allocated. The most ironic part of this fraud — and perhaps it someday will be recognized as the \"Piltdown Hoax\" of UFOlogy — is the eagerness with which Western UFO enthusiasts embraced the official Soviet conclusion: that UFOs were real and by implication FOBS flights and the military Plesetsk space center were not real! This is exactly what the Earl of Clancarty told the British House of Lords during a UFO debate on January 18, 1979: \"In July, August, September and October 1967, giant space ships were seen over various parts of the USSR by astronomers and other witnesses\" — but the spaceships, claimed the long- time UFO enthusiast (better known as Brinsley LePoer Trench), were not Soviet but extraterrestrial. Leading UFOlogist Dr. James McDonald, a much more respected and diligent researcher, also told a congressional symposium in 1968, while describing one of the 1967 FOBS entries, \"Clearly, satellites and meteors can be ruled out. The astronomers' observation cannot be readily explained in any conventional terms\" (it did indeed have a conventional explanation: it was Cosmos-171, a satellite, reentering the atmosphere like a meteor — but McDonald may be forgiven since that explanation was not \"readily\" available unless someone compared all the FOBS missions to all the Soviet 1967 \"crescent UFOs,\" which nobody, not even the ace aerospace sleuths at Aviation Week, ever did). The Moscow coverup had gone a long way to achieve such a blessing in the United States House of Representatives and in Britain's House of Lords! In light of these findings about the true nature of the Gindilis report, it may be instructive to review how the document was originally described by other leading Western UFOlogists when it was first published in 1980. The May 1980 CUFOS Associate Newsletter (Volume 1 Number 1) carried an article.by Dr. Hynek entitled \"Yes, Virginia, There Are UFOs in Russia.\" Therein he inaccurately described the document as a \"a study of 256 UFO reports from which the IFOs (Identified Flying Objects) have been eliminated\" — which is pure wishful thinking, unsupported even by claims in the Soviet text. A few months later, Hynek modified his assertion to read, \"The objects in the Soviet data were carefully selected with presumably most of the IFOs excluded....These had presumably been eliminated before the study proper began.\" Hynek's presumption in this regard was totally unjustified. In his own introduction to the pirated English-language edition published by CUFOS, Dr. Richard Haines particularly stressed the importance of the Soviet study: \"h should prove to become a standard reference on the library shelves of those who seek to identify the core identity of the anomalous atmospheric phenomena\" — but in the two years following its publication, there is no evidence that even a single Western UFOlogist was ever really interested in finding the \"core identity\" (instead, they concentrated on the more attractive \"statistical results\"). The UFOs in the Soviet study were nearly all genuine, Haines insisted: there was a \"lack of evidence for the reports being based on hallucinations or other misperceptions...The reports represent currently unknown phenomena, being completely different in nature in an 'overwhelming majority of cases' from known atmospheric optics effects or technical experiments in the atmosphere.\" As for the proportion of IFOs (such as hallucinations or false reports), \"their percentage is small, so that they have little effect on the statistical properties of the sample under consideration.\" But as has been shown, these \"false reports\" actually must comprise an absolute majority of the cases and they thus clearly overwhelm the parameters of any \"true UFO\" residue. Haines had absolutely no justification for making the sanguine assertions which he placed in his foreword. Hynek in turn again enthusiasti- cally embraced the report at the Smithsonian UFO Symposium in Washington, D.C., in September 1980, where he stressed the qualifications and scientific credentials of the witnesses: \"Forty two percent were made by scientific workers and engineers, and an amazing seven and a half percent were made by astronomers....It becomes very much harder, in fact from my personal viewpoint, impossible, to find a trivial solution for all UFO reports, which of course is the contention of the skeptics, if one weighs and considers the caliber of some of the witnesses.\" In light of the realization that the most spectacular misperceptions of the FOBS pseudo-UFOs came from astronomers at the Kazan and Kislovodsk Observatories, Hynek's assertion is exposed as unjustified at best and self-delusion at worst. \"Impossible\" is what Hynek considered it to be for the Gindilis data to have trivial solutions — but most of it did so have. (This point is worth pursuing a bit farther since it apparently is one of Hynek's most controversial and questionable attitudes towards UFOs. Later he said, \"It was actually the nature and character of many of the (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Soviet Cover-Up, Continued witnesses I personally worked with over many years that finally caused me to change my mind about UFOs. As a scientist I resisted the evidence and felt impelled to seek a normal explanation at all costs.\" But with the Gindilis data, Hynek evidently concluded that the qualifications of the witnesses — fellow astronomers in particular! — relieved him of the resoonsibility to seek just such normal explanations (that is, to be a scientist). It was \"impossible\" for them to be mistaken — but they were, and he was, too. He did not have to wax so enthusiastic over the unverified cases, but he did, and now must face the consequences.) An article jointly authored by Hynek and Haines appeared in the Journal of UFO Studies, volume II (1980). It stressed the \"similarity of results\" of the Soviet statistical study with other Western studies. Despite the concentration of 1967 .cases (i.e., mostly IFOs!), \"The essential agreement of the Soviet study with those made in other countries shows that his does not seem to have introduced a temporal bias.\" However, it turns out that this conclusion proved exactly the opposite of what Hynek and Haines throught it proved, to wit, that a statistically manipulated collection of IFO cases (which actually comprise the heart of the Gindilis Report) gives numerical results absolutely indistinguishable from similar manipulations of allegedly true-UFO cases. Ergo, the class of UFOs and the class of IFOs are really statistically indistinguishable, a conclusion which skeptics (and Allan Hendry) have been asserting all along. Naively, Hynek and Haines interpret the significance of the Soviet study as proving mathematically that UFOs are real, or that \"A heretofore unrecognized (by science) pheno- menon exists and is worthy of serious study,\" in their own words. \"The conclusions of the Condon Report,\" they continued, \" are thus totally reversed and the UFO phenomenon at one stroke becomes a legitimate subject for serious scientific attention. It is a great blow to the bastion of ridicule which has heretofore been so 10 effective a barrier to the exercise of proper scientific curiosity in this area.\" Brave words indeed — and as we have seen, once the true nature of the Gindilis Report is revealed, absolutely baseless words as well. Sadly, the only truly ridiculous aspect of this whole affair is the touchingly naive but tragically misplaced trust exhibited by Hynek and Haines in the faulty keystone assumption that the Soviet data had been carefully and honestly \"scrubbed,\" an assumption which conveniently relieved them of any responsibility to critically examine the data themselves (they clearly did not, nor did anyone else in the UFOlogical community). \"It seems incredible that the curiosity of the scientific fraternity has . not been aroused,\" they complain, in a closing paragraph bordering dangerously on satire — since after all, they themselves exhibited no such curiosity about the true nature of even the meager raw data presented in the paper, but chose instead to innocently misrepresent it for what it was not. Their unintentionally ironic closing quotation was from LaPlace: \"The harder .it is to acknowledge the existence of phenomena, the more we are obligated to investigate them with increasing care.\" This is an obligation at which Hynek and Haines, together with the rest of the Western UFOlogical fraternity, have themselves miserably failed in regard to the Gindilis Report. Once again the intuitive skepticism of \"Establishment Science\" toward the scientific validity of UFO studies has proven entirely justified; once again, the self-styled UFOlogists have proven to be their own worst enemies in their struggle to validate their long-sought scientific credentials. Meanwhile in Moscow the coverup continues with each new Plesetsk launch seen (but not recognized) by thousands of ordinary citizens. This coverup is aided unwittingly by UFO buffs around the world who have accepted the masquerade (provided both by private UFOlogists such as Zigel, by official publications such as the Gindilis Report, and by the endorsements of such data by Keyhoe, McDonald, Clancarty, Hynek, Haines, Moore, and other leading Western UFO experts) that these great Russian UFO cases cannot be explained in terms of any terrestrial activities — especially not in terms of Soviet military space activities. The sordid truth is that all of the greatest Russian UFO stories of the past two decades really can be confidently explained by documented Soviet military space shots. Conveniently for Moscow's high- pitched propaganda campaign against American military space activities, public awareness of its own far-busier activities has been safely sidetracked. UFOs from outer space over Russia? Soviet propagandists in Moscow smile encouragingly, \"Sure, that's what they must be — space vehicles from some other civilization, but certainly not ours.\" And .the greatest UFO coverup in history goes on. NOVA RESPONSE Following are excerpts from letters by MUFON personnel to the producers of the October P.B.S. NOVA program, \"The Case of the UFOs.\" We hope to publish additional comments in ensuing issues. \"I have enclosed a critique of the program on a case by case basis. Omissions, distortions, errors, and biases appeared throughout the production....Either the name of the program should have been \"Debunking UFOs,\" or some recognized scientists such as Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Dr. Willy Smith, Dr. Richard Haines, or others should have been given an opportunity to present the other viewpoint.\" John F. Schuessler, MUFON Deputy Director. \"This is anything but a balanced, fair, objective presentation, instead conveying the impression that nothing truly puzzling has ever been reliably reported.

Included in this definition are cases which involve claims of mental communications, poltergeists, apparitions, healings, ghostlights, and time lapses/ \"abductions\". Since my first paper on PSIUFO phenomena was published (Moravec, 1980), I have been engaged in collating and analyzing the relevant reports which have occurred in Australia. The results of this research has recently been published by the Australian Centre for UFO Studies in a 137-page document titled, PSIUFO Phenomena: A Study of UFOs and the Paranormal (Moravec, 1981b). The aim of this article is to briefly outline the types of cases studied and the main findings of the project. The cases studied can be classified in six categories, as follows: 1. MENTAL COMMUNI- CATIONS: A person claims to have received communications from a source usually identified as a UFO entity. The communication may be received through a variety of modes including telepathy, automatic writing, trance states, or visions. 2. POLTERGEISTS: Usually involves the unexplained movement of objects. Either selective poltergeist-like effects are observed to occur during a UFO experience, or a UFO experience is preceded or followed by a classic object-throwing poltergeist. 3. APPARITIONS: Hallucinatory experience of the visual kind, usually involving a human figure. Percipient may see apparitions prior to, during, or after his UFO experience. .4. HEALINGS: Rapid or instantaneous healings of physiological wounds, where such healings are not achievable by present medical techniques under the circumstances described. In the UFO context, a physiological wound may be found to be \"healed\" immediately following a UFO experience. 5. GHOSTLIGHTS: Small lights which usually occur close to ground level and tend to reappear in the same location. May become associated with a local folklore of tragic death. 6. TIME LAPSES/ABDUCT- IONS: Percipient is unable to consciously recall the events which occurred during a certain period of time. During hypnotic regression, percipient may recount a bizarre tale of \"abduction\" by UFO entities. One of the aims of the project was to seek out and catalogue all known existing Australian cases of PSIUFO phenomena. Eventually 88 cases were located, most falling under the categories of ghostlights, mental communications, and apparitions. At the opposite extreme, only one case of alleged paranormal healing was located. Examination of the annual distribution of reports revealed that, ghostlights have been steadily reported since at least the 1830's. Reports of mental communications and apparitions largely surfaced from the mid-1950's onwards. But it was not until the beginning of the 1970's that cases of all categories were regularly reported. This greater frequency of cases in recent years is to be expected, given the relatively modern development of a network of UFO investigators. Looking at the number of percipients, almost half of the cases (43 out of 88) involved multiple percipients. Here, the type of case is important. For example, cases featuring mental communications were frequently single-percipient cases whereas ghostlights frequently involved more than one percipient. These simple statistical analyses can be informative. For example, we have the facts that ghostlights have been steadily reported since the 1830's and often involve multiple percipients, whereas mental communications (in the UFO context) have only been reported in more recent times and most frequently involve only one percipient. Could it be that ghostlights are constantly occurring physical phenomena whereas mental communication cases are psycho- logical phenomena increasingly reported during a favorable social climate of belief? The reliability of individual cases (a factor usually ignored in most catalogues of reports) was rated according to levels of documentation, time lapse before investigation, witness credibility, supportive physical evidence, and strangeness. This analysis revealed a wide range of case reliability. Some cases, especially the historical ones, were merely anecdotes or unconfirmed media acounts. Other cases had been thoroughly documented at the site of the occurrences by qualified UFO investigators. The most striking patterns appeared in connection with the \"time lapse before investigation\" and \"physical evidence\"' scales. Few cases had been investigated within one week of the occurrences, and few cases featured supportive physical evidence. Despite the above limitations, there was a residue of provocative, high merit cases which are deserving of further study. One of the study's conclusions is that a large proportion of PSIUFO cases can be explained as due to psychological .processes. This is particularly true for the mental communication, apparition, and time lapse cases, where the \"messages\" come from the percipient's own unconscious rather than from any external intelligence. Such psychological processes as hypnopompic/hypnagogic imagery, psychotic hallucinations, and fugue states all appear to play a role in various cases. This situation can be (continued on next page) 11"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Percipient Studies Group By Mark Moravec In early 1982, the Percipient Studies Group (PSG) was formed with the aim of researching the human factors involved in anomalous experiences. The group will examine the psychological, sociological, physiological, and alleged para- psychological aspects of UFO experiences and related phenomena. The aims are to increase our understanding of: (1) UFOs and other anomalous phenomena; and (2) human experience and behavior in general. To achieve this, the Percipient Studies Group plans to involve behavioral scientists and other interested researchers in the in-depth study of individual percipients to anomalous experiences, the comparison of groups of percipients and nonpercipients, and any other studies deemed relevant. As an initial project, the PSG would like to set up an Australian capability for the in-depth psychologigal and physiological study of . UFO percipients. It is hoped to establish a set of standardized psychological and medical testing procedures which will produce useful data of the ' least ambiguous nature. It is envisaged that the application of these techniques would be especially relevant to UFO cases involving pronounced psychological reactions, \"repeater\" percipients, and PSIUFO phenomena. The involvement of psychologists, PSIUFO, Continued summarized by the ASC-UFO Hypothesis: \"Predisposed individuals, in certain situations, undergo an altered state of consciousness during which vivid, subjective sensations are experienced and interpreted in a personally meaningful (UFO) context.\" (ASC = altered state of consciousness. See also Moravec, 1981a, for a further discussion of this hypothesis.) In other cases, particularly those involving ghostlights, natural physical phenomena (such as ignited marsh gas, clusters of luminous insects, light refraction effects, and ball lightning) appear to explain some cases. Yet, despite the above explanations, there remains a puzzling and significant residue of high-merit cases which may involve paranormal and/or extra- ordinary physical factors in their causation. A major part of the study concentrates on extensive discussion of the possible explanations for PSIUFO phenomena; the important issues facing the investigator; and the implications of the phenomena for our understanding of UFOs, psi, and the world at large. The report also includes complete details on the evaluation/ rating system used to determine case 12 reliability, and specialized question- naires designed to aid the investigator of PSIUFO cases. I refer interested readers to the complete report for further information and discussion. Whether PSIUFO phenomena can be satisfactorily explained in terms of psychological processes and natural phenomena, or whether other more exotic explanations are also necessary, the continued study of such cases is certainly worthwhile. It promises to further our understanding of the nature of anomalous experiences, the workings of the human mind, and the nature of the reality\" surrounding us.

Between 3:30 and 4:15 p.m., color photographs and 8 mm movie film were taken of a brilliant, needle-like white object, also observed by 20-30 witnesses in a 2-block area. The phenomenon was first seen in the southern sky, inclined 10-20 degrees from the horizontal, then \"...moved quickly toward the SE and was noted to drop considerably in elevation where it was observed by witnesses for 45 minutes.\" Finally, \"...it rolled up into a ball, darting about the sky before it went straight up as if shot from a slingshot.\" (Detailed investigation report by Walt Greenawald, MUFON Field Investigator, 20709 Collins St., Woodland Hills, CA 91367).

About 12:30 a.m., three rangers and a . maintenance man observed an object with white, red, and green/blue body lights, variously sketched as arrowhead- or fish-shaped, first illuminating the ocean offshore and emitting a humming sound. The UFO moved slowly, rising and then flying overhead and out of sight. (Detailed investigation report, including transcripts of witness interviews, by Wayne E. Scott.) Aug. 30, 1981; El Cajon, Calif. En route home along a dark rural road about 10:35 p.m., a computer engineer suddenly saw in his headlight beams an object that he first thought was a low- hovering helicopter. As a collision seemed imminent, the car stopped without brakes being applied. The interior of the car was illuminated. The door and windows could not be opened, and the witness was frightened to the verge of panic. \"He (then) felt a feeling of having left the car and of having been touched or handled...then...of being back in the car.\" As he drove away, a light followed and circled the car. Witness pulled out a gun that he carried in the car, firing six shots out the window. He fled at high speed, arriving home about 11:00 a.m. in a highly agitated state. Some of the details emerged under later hypnosis. His digital watch malfunctioned after the event, and he noticed red dots like puncture marks on his wrists.

About 10:00 p.m. a baker/cook (who also is an Army Reservist) was returning home when he observed a disc-like object hovering off to his left, and he stopped to watch. \"The object seemed, to have a dome of some sort...near the base of the object were red, green, blue, and white lights that blinked in rotation...He heard a low humming noise...observed the object hover for approximately 15 minutes and after that...the object rose rapidly upwards and started leaving, smoothly, in a circular path.\" (Investigation by George Parsons, Jr., MUFON State Section Director and Director of UFO Investigative Researchers, Ashland, Ky.)

If and when the existence of crashed and retrieved spacecraft ever becomes an accepted scientific fact, much of the credit for blasting this out of the solid rock of government secrecy wjll have to go to Len Stringfield. His tireless efforts to unearth and track down scores of vague leads to witnesses to various events in this highly puzzling matter are detailed (to the extent that his pledges of confidentially will permit) in his latest publication. To the average man or woman, almost any detailed report of UFO activity will appear very strange, while to the veteran UFO student, most have a loud ring of familiarity. But it would be hard to imagine even the most jaded of UFO specialists failing to gasp at some of the reports in this latest Stringfield monograph. While the reliability of most of the anecdotes is certainly open to question, their strangeness ratings threaten to break through the roof: 12 first-person reports, 15 second-hand reports, and another dozen that could hold some water, but for one reason or another must be given a lower rating. In addition, there is material covering alleged highly secret government operations, publications, and inside informants which, due to their -obviously sensitive nature, can only be hinted at. Two pages are devoted to an analysis of reported physical characteristics, and one to a bibliography of appropriate reading materials for the devotee of crash/retrieval stories. This booklet is the third step, in Len's publication program which began with a condensed version of a talk he gave at the 1978 MUFON Symposium, in Dayton, Ohio, which was published in the July and August, 1978, issues of the MUFON UFO Journal. The second step was his 37-page UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome. Status Report II: New Sources, New Data, published in 1980 by MUFON. Clearly, he means this third report to be just one more collection of information, leads, and rumors, rather than a completed work. The organization resembles that of original source material, more than a smooth, logical narrative. And it is full of initials in place of names, one result of his almost annoyingly consistent dedication to preserving the anonymity of his touchy sources. But his aim is to learn more, rather than to trumpet that which he has already learned. Len is clearly more aware than even the reader, that his material consists of little more than indistinct pieces of a puzzle whose over-all dimensions remain a total mystery. If you want \"answers,\" read the National Enquirer] If you want an honest view of the situation, then by all means plow through Stringfield's often disconnected collection of fascinating bits of information. Not only does the reader learn much of what Stringfield has learned, but he also experiences the plodding leg-work and the frustration of one who has taken upon himself a monumental task. As yet, not a single one of his many sources has developed to the point of public usefulness. But one gets a feeling, after re-reading the first two status reports, that progress is definitely being made. As literature — even UFO literature — this is not one of the most imposing tomes ever written. As a coherent account of the mysterious crash/retrieval story, it leaves a lot to be desired. But as a collection of information about what could yet become the most exciting and important aspect of the entire UFO mystery, it is far beyond anything previously done by anyone. — Don Berliner (Ed.

In every case in the book, I found at least one major dubious aspect, often several. Six of the cases were developed under hypnosis, and were subject to the almost inevitable distortion even with a careful professional hypnotist. At least two of these six struck me as clearly \"made up\" stories that seemed to have only marginal relevance to the UFO event that triggered the investigation. At least two of the ten subjects appeared to be suffering some sort of medical/psychological problem that could well influence what they think they saw. At least two of the cases were of the \"low stimulation\" type: people driving long hours, usually late at night, on a lonely tiring boring road, and without realizing it drifting off into an altered.state of consciousness, from a combination of their physical tiredness and the lack of stimulation from the environment, in which they begin to \"see things.\" The book's editor D. Scott Rogo has written some commentaries thoughout. In his concluding chapter, he seeks to find a way that would lead to an explanation of the \"abduction\" process. He compares it to the dreaming we all do every night. I thought for a moment that he was about to reach the simple, sensible conclusion that there's a considerable similarity 'between the stories we develop when hypnotized and asked to tell a story, and the stories we develop in our dreams during sleep. And Rogo does indeed suggest the \"abduction\" experience is a \"dream.\" But he quickly dances away from that and invents a complex \"explanation\": The \"dream,\" he says, is \"extracted from the unconscious mind of the UFO witness\" 16 by something he calls \"The Phenomenon,\" and this \"dream\" is then \"beamed back to him in the form of a UFO abduction!\" (exclamation mark in the original!) Rogo does offer one suggestion that I can heartily endorse. He says \"we should stop focusing our attention on the UFO events surrounding the abduction experience,\" and seek out more detailed psychological information about the people involved. Good idea. Unfortunately, this psychological background of the \"abductee\" is generally missing from the cases collected in this book. \"The Amazing Case of Antonio Villas Boas\" by Gordon Creighton is about a young Brazillian. farmer who said he was \"kidnapped\" while operating. his tractor late at night, and then aboard the UFO had a sexual encounter with a beautiful nude young \"alien\" woman. Most of the article is translation of a deposition made by the \"victim,\" with little information given on the sort of psychological background Rogo calls for. I note that Villas Boas was described as \"visibly discouraged\" when told \"that the major Brazilian publication O Cruzeiro would not publish the story since it was so lacking in proof. From the fact that Villas Boas was working at night, I suspect he had little social life; the content of his story suggests a problem more sexual than extraterrestrial. \"The Ultimate Alien Encounter\" by Jerome Clark is about as \"ultimate\" as the previous case was \"amazing.\" This describes an automobile trip made by a young couple from Minnesota headed for Los Angeles. Bill and Nora apparently drove virtually straight through into Utah, except for stopping by the side of the road for a few hours the first night. The stress of this long drive was heightened by Bill \"habitually\" driving at 90 miles per hour; Nora might well have become tense also at such speeding, particularly with her 2-year-old son in the back seat. At one point the \"steering wheel refused to turn,\" for some time there was a \"light in the sky\" which followed them, and once they were \"unable\" to get the speed of the car above 55. Trying to get away from -the UFO \"following\" them, they pulled in to a camping area, where Bill saw something like a \"snowman\" which Nora couldn't see and which he couldn't see either when they turned the headlights back on. Soon after, back on the road, they passed a camper truck where the occupants, they believe, \"didn't have heads.\" Their hypnotism experience, some time later, failed to explain the random \"strange events\" they had noted, and appeared to be the typical melange of what they thought happened on the trip with what was already in their heads (what a Lawsonian would term birth trauma material). Ann Druffel, the longtime southern California UFO investigator, is my favorite UFO writer. I admire the way she maintains a straight face while spinning the most bizarre tale, and I admire her chutzpah (although I don't approve of it) in occasionally omitting or at least delaying vital bits of information. \"Encounter on Dapple Gray Lane\" is vintage Druffel. Two young men spend a long evening at a friend's place, and at 2 a.m. they get into the car to go home, and turn on the headlights. They see one — or maybe two — mysterious \"objects\" a few feet ahead of them: \"the shape of brains....filmy bluish....something red....It could have been anything.\" Whatever, they were frightened, and quickly drove away.

When people spend a long evening with friends, beverages are often served, and these beverages sometimes affect perception. Ms. Druffel does not mention whether any beverages were imbibed, although she does tell us Hodges was a chain smoker (heavy smoking and heavy drinking often go together). After many pages of descripton of the sessions with a hypnotist, Ms. Druffel finally gets around to telling us that Hodges believes a \"gray-skinned humanoid\" had arranged a \"beam of light\" which \"implanted\" a \"translater\" in his brain. This sort of \"those forces out there are controlling my brain\" is, of course, the hallmark of the schizophenric; what little belief I had in this story evaporated at that point. Ms. Druffel, straight-faced as ever, assures us she will try to get Hodges a brain scan, despite its expense, in an attempt to verify his claim about the implanted translater. She also passes along several statements and predictions Hodges made about international events, including one that no atomic bomb fell on Hiroshima. The Hodges version of world history is that U.S. bombers dropped magnesium thermite to \"create a blinding flash,\" and scattered fissionable material to pretend a nuclear blast had occurred, but the destruction there was caused by \"natural earthquakes\" which appeared to come at the same time. Ms. Druffel checked this and other claims with a \"MUFON physics consultant\" and determined that there was no need to rewrite the history books — his claim about Hiroshima, she concedes, is \"erroneous.\" If these cases are the best that \"abduction theorists can come up with — or even if they are just your typical average \"abduction\" case — it looks to me that the \"abuduction\" theory is in Big Trouble. But the Rogovian suggestion for delving into the psychological background of witnesses would help clear up the matter. The next time Rogo puts together an anthology, I hope he will take his own excellent advice. Open Letter Response Dear Robert: Dick Hall, our friend and colleague, gave me the chance to repond to your comments and also gave me a choice of ignoring them. I was tempted to take the latter choice, as criticism is plentiful and time is precious, and my garden calls on this sunny Saturday. May I respond briefly. First, I don't omit or delay information on cases. I am, perhaps, noted for including seemingly stray bits of information which surface during the investigation of a case, even though some will offend purists, annoy colleagues, and startle newcomers. My philosophy of UFO investigation is that whatever the witness thinks happened and suspects is pertinent to the UFO experience is worth reporting. The witness is the only UFO \"expert\" because they are the only ones who experience the phenomena first hand. I.did not \"delay\" the information that John Hodges in the Dapple Gray Lane case believes the \"gray-skinned humanoids\" implanted a \"translater\" in his brain. According to Hodges, this specific information was not \"given\" to him until a very, long time after the original encounter and many months after the first article on the case appeared in FSR. You indicate I believe everything I hear and write about. This is not the case. I try to accurately report what the witnesses state. But I carefully select the cases (particularly the CE III and IV cases) I write about. Only about one out of five cases meet my criteria for lengthy investigation. Most alleged CE III and IV witnesses are so emotionally damaged that their statements cannot add anything valuable to UFO research. I select the best I can find, and repeat what the most rational, productive, and seemingly honest persons state so that other researchers who .wish to specialize in CE III and IV cases can have added material to work from. I personally belieue nothing (as far as UFO cases go) that I have not personally experienced. But, as you say, Abductions Abound! Truer words were never spoken. These cases are proliferating like ants on a picnic cake. What are we to do with hundreds of these stories beseiging us on all sides? You recommend that each CE case be accompanied with psychological examinations. I'd be delighted to be able to do this, but where is the funding for this? California psychologists, at least, do not work for free. Many of us have spent thousands of hours actively chasing down reports of UFO sightings. I don't mean just close encounters, but everything — NLs, DDs, and IFOs so multiplex as to stagger the imagination. Many of us spend hours in the middle of the night (instead of sleeping), trying to put together reasonably condensed articles for research journals, often working from two-inch thick files. Details do get passed over at times; journal space is limited. All reasonable, objective researchers try their best to publish the few wheat kernels found in the mountainous chaff of \"reports.\" Researchers are supposed to be colleagues. We seldom agree with each other; each differs a little in philosophy and theory. But most of us respect each other as fellow humans and searchers for elusive truth. We try to substitute friendly discussion for destructive criticism. May I suggest that you go out and investigate CE III and IV cases for a few years and be subjected to the stresses and strains of separating signal from noise. Such experience will strengthen the soul and soften the tongue. We all try to do our best, but we are humans researching something which, as yet, humans cannot understand.

Fowler, has reached the final stages of preparation. In order to stay abreast of the state-of- the-art in UFOlogy investigative techniques, we are adding the following new material or sections: (1) Computer enhancement of UFO photographs; (2) Hypnosis as an investigative aid; (3) Evaluation of UFO-related • medical injuries; (4) Updated investigation of alleged UFO landing sites; (5) Current bright planet location chart; (6) New sighting questionnaires for residual radiation (Form 10) and aerial sightings (Form 11); and new computer input (Form 2). The manual was delayed due to printing cost considerations occurring simultaneously with publishing the Thirteenth Annual MUFON UFO Symposium Proceedings, however that problem has now been resolved. Considering the amount of work still to be done and the time to print the manual, it will not be available until March of 1983. The exact date will be announced, in the Journal. We have been receiving many requests for the new manual, especially from newly organized groups for training programs, Field Investigator Trainees, and State Section Directors preparing for new Field Investigator instruction courses. Even though the manual is not available, we have been given the opportunity to provide an outstanding book to all of our members to supplement our present and new manuals. \"Observing UFOs\" by Richard F. Haines, published by Nelson-Hall in Chicago, is highly recommended for the serious UFO investigator by J. Allen Hynek. Written as an investigative handbook, the scope and depth of the investigative techniques exceed that-of MUFON's basic Field Investigator's Manual in some areas, making it an ideal supplementary handbook for the serious researcher and investigator. Dr. Haines, a NASA research scientist specializing in the problems of human perception since 1967, had this specific goal clearly in mind when he detailed more sophisticated methods to obtain more reliable information and data. The hardcover edition of this book sold for $14.95. The paperback version retails for $10.95. It is not the conventional small size paperback but what is known as the trade size. The pages are identical in size to the hardback version. Through special arrangements with the author and his publisher (Nelson-Hall), MUFON has purchased a limited number of paperback copies which are available from MUFON for $5.00 plus $1.50 for postage and handling in U.S. funds. This is a rare opportunity to obtain such an outstanding book for this price. DATA MART Earth Theories I wish to share ideas relating to \"earth-bound\" theories of UFOs, such as possible locations of UFO bases on earth, \"histories\" of UFO bases or activities in the past, etc. I have some interesting ideas on these topics.

Versions of this particular story have circulated for years and the latest one appears in the October 19 issue of NATIONAL ENQUIRER. British UFO researcher Lord Clancarty (Brinsley Le Poer Trench) claims to have been told of the top-level meeting by a former U.S. test pilot who was present when the aliens demonstrated their highly-advanced technology. An article in the November 2 ENQUIRER claims that six Soviet merchant seamen were abducted from a freighter in the Black Sea by a UFO resting on the surface of the water. A UFO which dropped two \"light bombs\" was reported by two police officers in the town of Monmouth, Wales, according to the ENQUIRER for November 9. THE STAR for October 19 gives details of Betty Andreasson Luca's claims of further contact with alien beings, as reported in Raymond Fowler's recent book THE ANDREASSON AFFAIR: PHASE TWO. James Oberg, not content with \"explaining\" Soviet UFO reports of the 1970's, has now gone back to 1967, claiming that sightings from that year were also due to secret Soviet rocket tests. The details of his argument appear in the \"Anti-Matter/UFO Update\" section of November OMNI. (Also in the October and November issues of this Journal-Ed.) An interesting letter/article in the December issue of FATE is an account by admitted UFO skeptic Robert Schadewald of a UFO which he and a companion observed. Schadewald's conclusions about what he saw are as informative as the description of the UFO itself. A correction for an error appearing in my review of Herbert J. Strentz's A SURVEY OF PRESS COVERAGE OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS, 1947-1966, appearing in the August 1982 issue of the JOURNAL.

John Mansfield, Executive Producer, was deluged with letters expressing the viewer's displeasure with the negative slant and obvious \"debunking\" of the phenomenon by the participants. Many of the people were disenchanted in the integrity of P.B.S. and the NOVA series to use such a poor quality program. An open letter was mailed to all State Directors and Board of Directors prior to the program suggesting how they should respond to the program. My letter was published in the September 1982 edition of the MUFON UFO Journal. The following people shared copies of their letters to John Mansfield with your Director: Robert H. Bletchman, Peter Rank, M.D., Walter N. Webb, John F. Schuessler, William H. Banks, Mrs. Marge Christensen, Mike Jarmus (WCTC Radio), Leland Bechtel, Dr. Willy Smith,, and Donald J. Long. Some State Directors relayed my letter to all State Section Directors as suggested. They were Paul Cerny, Robert Engberg, Joe Santangelo, and Mrs. Mildred Biesele. Since the program was aired simultaneously with the first game of the World Series, I am confident that the P.B.S. viewing audience was small, which may have been a \"blessing in disguise.\" The people who voiced their objections to John Mansfield through their letters all received the same answer. Following is a copy of his response letter: Thank you for your letter about our NOVA, \"The Case of the UFO's.\" As you challenge the validity and objective balance of the film, I am passing your letter to the producer who made it for his detailed replay. As this was a co-production with the BBC in London, I hope you will forgive the inevitable delay necessitated by sending your letter across the Atlantic. As executive producer of NOVA I should however add that, although I was not involved in the detailed research of this program, I have no reason to doubt the quality, honesty, or objectivity of the producer involved. Yours sincerely, /s/ John Mansfield, Executive Producer NOVA, JM/qa. 19"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE w Newsletter No. 2 for the North American UFO Federation Steering Committee was distributed on October 21, 1982 by John Schuessler, Chairman. In a questionnaire mailed to all committee members as an action item for October 5th, the replies were all affirmative. The points resolved were the following: (1) The action item form will be used as submitted. (2) Committee members will pay their own postage (within reason). (3) The newsletter will be used to advise committee members on the results of all votes/issues. (4) The newsletter will be available to anyone for the fee of 10 cents per page plus postage. A $5.00 deposit is requested from anyone wishing to receive committee information. Committee members will receive all material free of charge. We will not advertise/solicit subscriptions, but will provide the material as a courtesy. Organizational (CUFOS, MUFON, SBI, etc.) newsletters may carry the results as they desire. (5) A simple majority of the membership is required to carry the vote on any issue. (6) The work of the committee is expected to be completed by July 1983. As Chairman of the steering committee, Mr. Schuessler has received detailed inputs on federation purpose, scope, authority, structure, etc. from Peter Mazzola, Charles Wilhelm, Rick Hillberg, and Henry McKay. On the other hand, he has received unsolicited inputs from UFOlogists from the nonparticipating sectors expressing concern that the federation committee is structuring an organization to \"take over.\" John personally feels that this may be a suspicion that will be leveled at any attempt to change the status quo. This factor is worth considering when we are attempting to structure a federation that can serve and support most of the people working in this field. Our actions must show that we are endeavoring to foster unity, not division. It has been suggested that the format submitted by Pete Mazzola of SBI be used as the starting place and building on his input, because of the 1 way it is organized. Your International Director would like to commend Mr. Mazzola for his outstanding input that not only asks questions why we should form a federation, but provides detailed answers to these pertinent questions. It is refreshing to be associated and involved with a person having such a positive attitude as Peter Mazzola. (This is in direct contrast to articles appearing in recent issues of the APRO Bulletin.) A teleconference of steering committee members to discuss the vital issues in a structured agenda has been targeted for mid-December if all of the arrangements can be made, including financing. Another example of enthusiastic leadership is evident in the organizational work being performed by Dan Wright, State Director for Michigan (1502 Marquette, Lansing, MI 48906) in his announcement of State Section Director assignments. Joe Stewart will now be responsible for Clinton, Eaton, Ingham, Jackson, and Shiawassee Counties. Jim Ferritto has expanded to include Saginaw, Bay, and Midland Counties. William M.
