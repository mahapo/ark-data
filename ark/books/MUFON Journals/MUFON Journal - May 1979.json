FROM THE EDITOR As Bruce Maccabee's \"report in this issue indicates, the December 1978 New Zealand movie film and associated radar-visual sightings appear to be of extraordinary importance — contrary to the premature opinions of many \"scientific\" non-investigators. Philip Klass, whose skeptical views were publicized as authoritative on national television and in the New Zealand press, deserves to be criticized for his unscientific attitude. Indeed, if he and the numerous scientists remote from the scene who pontificated without investigation controlled UFO investigations, we wouldn't have Jo, bother investigating because we would know the answers in. advance. Such blatant pre-judgment is supposed to be a cardinal sin in science. More objective \"ufologists\" are not so cock-sure and prefer to gather and analyze more complete evidence before passing judgement. Dr. Maccabee is a credit to the scientific profession; the \"skeptics\" (a term misapplied to consistent debunkers) are not. In this issue MISSOURI LANDING-TRACE CASE   .3 By Donald L.

Koch (Edited by Walt Andrus) Sunday, October 8, 1978, was to be an exciting day for the Marlett Sturgell family as dawn illuminated their 500-acre farm in rural Barry County in southwestern Missouri. Having their daughter, son-in-law, and grandson home for the weekend from Kansas City was the first big event. From the window of their farmhome at 7:00 AM C.D.S.T., Mrs. Marlett Sturgell and her grandson were scanning the pasture below them in the bend of Flat Creek for coyotes which frequently appear at this time of the morning. The grandson was thrilled when they spotted one coyote in the early morning light about 250 yards from the home. In addition to the coyote, a cow and calf were also standing in a group near what appeared to Mrs. Sturgell as a white cow lying in the green fescue grass pasture. Having seen the coyote, Mrs. Sturgell and her daughter Mrs. Raymond L. Morgan (Frances) started . preparing a big breakfast for the men who were now getting up and starting their farm chores. After a leisurely breakfast and the usual family visiting, the subject turned to the coyote and the white cow in the pasture. When Marlett Sturgell advised his wife that they didn't have any white cows, he went to the window to try to identify what she had observed. The time was now 9:00 AM. The coyote was now \"hunched down,\" the cow and calf were still peering at the object, but the \"white cow\" in the bright sunlight looked more like a tarpaulin covering something. After further scrutiny from that distance, he was sure that it was something that had fallen off an airplane, since it was metallic and aluminum in color. The Sturgell's adult son Norman had gone back to the bam to continue his morning chores, when Mr. Sturgell, his sonrin-law, Raymond L. Morgan, and grandson went outside to try to identify what looked like a piece of sheet metal in the pasture. Seeing his father come outside, Norman called to him to ask him drive their tractor from the house to the barn. Ray Morgan arid his son started walking down toward the pasture as Mr. Sturgell pulled up to the barn and cut the engine. At this moment, to the amazement of the witnesses, the metal \"thing\" in the field started rising and went over a nearby walnut tree, moving at an angle toward the west. Mr. Sturgell said that it was an aluminum color and very shiny. The object continued to climb at an angle into the western sky that was dotted with white clouds. There was no appreciable wind. As the group of six people watched the ascending object diminish in size with distance, their eyes were drawn to a second object that they at first thought was an airplane. \"It looked like a big aircraft — it was long—just laying there motionless in the sky\" is the way Marlett Sturgell described the second object. The \"thing\" that had taken off from the pasture flew directly toward the hovering craft high in the blue sky. As the witnesses followed the small object, it either flew under the \"airplane\" or went directly up to it. As the two objects converged, the family was shocked when both simply disappeared in the clear blue sky. No sound was heard at any time. When Mr. Sturgell was interviewed and quizzed about the shape and size of the landed UFO, the stated it was about 4 feet thick, but he couldn't figure out how wide it was due to the angle at which he viewed it at takeoff. He said it could have had a rounded or flat top, he wasn't sure, because as it got up to tree-top level, he could only see the bottom side. He felt it was egg shaped. The group estimated that the elapsed time for the UFO to fly from the pasture to the second hovering object in the sky was 5 to 10 minutes before both instantly vanished from the sky. Mr. Sturgell initially assumed that the long, dark-colored, log-shaped object in the sky was an airplane, but no wings, motors, tail, or vertical fin were visible to identify it as a conventional aircraft. Even though he had a good view of the bottom of the UFO, Marlett Sturgell could not see any legs or landing gear. Mr. Sturgell is 71 years of age, has good eyesight, and was wearing corrective lens glasses during his observation from near the barn. He noted a vertical dark streak on the side of the UFO closest to them, contrasted to the aluminum color. He had driven the tractor from the house to the barn, as he continued to glance toward the unknown object restingin the field. The tractor performed normally. He had just cut the ignition switch off, when the object started its ascent. During subsequent 'conversations with friends, he had been asked \"if he was afraid to go down to the pasture to investigate at close range?,\" or \"why he didn't go down to it and kick it over?,\" and \"why he didn't get his gun and shoot a hole in it?\" He said \"it never dawned on him to do either, and he definitely wouldn't have shot at it — a silly thing to do.\" Mrs. Marlett (Dora) Sturgell was interviewed on two occasions, the second simply a follow-up on the landing site pasture conditions. Only Mrs. Sturgell's observations that differed from that of her husband, or additional information, will be related in this report. She confirmed that the long object in the sky .had no visible wings, tail, or motor. She described the \"airplane\" as a \"long grey-white board or something, laying up there.\" Her son-in-law, Raymond L. Morgan, also reiterated this detail. She only noted one white cloud in that portion of the (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"(Missouri Landing, Continued) western sky and the object wasn't close to the cloud. As for the small object in the pasture, she stated that it had slanted sides that reflected the sunlight from its brilliant surfaces. She also described a round dome shape that slanted away and had a dark streak on the lower side. Considering the length of the observation time (ascension was 5 to 10 minutes), she said that they had time to phone their neighbors to observe the objects, but \"they all wanted to see what it was going to do.\" She didn't even think about UFOs at this time. It must be noted that Mrs. Sturgell first observed the object in the pasture at 7:00 AM and it didn't take off until 9:00 AM when the family went out in the yard to investigate. She estimated the length of the \"airplane\" as the width of her two thumbs placed side by side at arms length. Mrs. Raymond L. (Frances) Morgan, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Sturgell, was interviewed by telephone in Kansas City, Mo., and offered the following additional comments. She also went to the window at about 7:00 .AM to see the coyote that her mother had pointed out to Mrs. Morgan's teen- aged son. In the dawn light, Frances thought the object in the pasture looked like a \"big white feed sack made of plastic or something, sort of standing or hanging up on the weeds.\" She also noted that the cows seemed to be observing the object and a coyote was sitting nearby. She observed the \"lift off\" from the window at the front porch of the Sturgell home. Frances gopher best view when the object rose to fence- post height. She said that it went straight up to tree-top level and then angled off to the right (west). Mrs. Morgan observed that the object was very \"shiny,\" and had a black strip on it, and it seemed to float upward during the lift off. She then rushed outside to get a better view as it climbed, joining her husband, mother, and son down by the front gate where their cars were parked. She described the small object as \"looking like a big wash tub —. a big round thing.\" When it was sitting in the pasture, she couldn't detect any curvature and it looked white in color, *• -?-• .f*i Investigators at scene, I to r, Deputy Sheriff Steve Breeden, Tom Yapp, and George Koch fPhoto by Donald L. Seneker) however, after it took off and got up into the bright sunlight it was very shiny — like aluminum. When she was asked about the black stripe, she said it was wider than the pin stripe on an automobile and ran the length of the egg-shaped object. Mrs. Morgan also observed the \"airplane pretty high in the sky\" and stated that the width of her thumb at arms length would just cover the object's length. She couldn't see any wings on the \"airplane.\" It was Mrs. Morgan's telephone call to the Barry County Sheriff's Office in Cassville, Mo., at about 11:30 PM, against her father's wishes, that touched off this sighting investigation. She personally felt it should be reported and was curious to know if anyone else had observed anything. Norman Sturgell, the grown son of Marlett and Dora Sturgell who lives at home, was at the barn and viewed the UFO from the same vantage point as his father. The teenage son of Mr. and Mrs. Morgan picked his own observation point in the yard when part of the family started down to the pasture to identify the object. Of the many photographs taken of the landing site, Raymond Lassiter, their neighbor across the road, took the first set about 10:30 AM. The initial investigation by Deputy Sheriff Steve Breeden that afternoon probably produced the best detailed description of the landing site. While working at the Sheriffs Office on Sunday morning, October 8th, Steve received a telephone call at 11:00 AM from Mrs. Frances Morgan asking who one should contact when you spot a UFO. This whetted his appetite and immediate interest. She stated that she and her family had spotted one near Jenkins, Mo., where her parents live on Flat Creek. Since Deputy Sheriff Breeden was on duty at the office, he could not leave until 3:30 PM to investigate. Accompanied by his father- in-law, they drove to the Marlett Sturgell farm, which is about one and one half miles east of Cato, Mo. Upon arriving, he found that Frances Morgan, her husband Raymond and son, had already left to return to Kansas City. Mr. Breeden immediately took a statement of,the episode from Marlett Sturgell for his official report. He was taken to the landing site where he obtained soil and grass samples and made Polaroid color photographs. When examining the area, his first impression was that a tripod had been resting inside the 4- foot-diameter circle of scorched grass."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Pasture at Marlett Sturgell farm; Ref. 1 - start of pasture; Ref. 2 - position of Sturgell during lift-off of object (Photo by Donald L. Seneker) The three 6 to 8 inch diameter circles were spaced in nearly an equilateral triangle, however, the two closest to each other were spaced about 2 feet apart at their edges and were both 2 l / 2 to 3 feet away from the third on the north side. The outer edges of each tripod circle had the fescue grass removed exposing the bare soil, while the inner part of each circle \"had the burnt grass twisted as if it was caught in some kind of an auger or looked like someone had set an eggbeater down there and just twisted the .grass in a clockwise rotation.\" The fescue grass was entirely removed in a doughnut shape about 3 inches wide on the outer edge of each tripod circle. (The grass was twisted or swirled. within the hole of each doughnut-shaped area.) The fescue grass in the remainder of the 4-foot- diameter circle had turned a dark purple-black color, not exactly burned, but very dried out. The remainder of the pasture was a lush green, since this was prior to the first frost of the season. Pplaroid color photographs taken by the Deputy Sheriff at 4:15 PM on 'October 8th show the areas of bare vegetation and the purple color of the fescue grass within the large circle. When we conducted our first interview with Mr. and Mrs. Sturgell on October 29, 1978, they found that even though the frost had caused the grass in the pasture to start turning brown, a ring of bright fresh green fescue grass now appeared outside of the original discolored and dehydrated area, just as if it had been fertilized. Steve Breeden observed the site on October 8th and again after the frost, so he could testify to the changes that had transpired as it related to the bright green ring of grass. We took photographs that confirm this unusual transformation. The apparent green enriched area is 10 to 12 inches in width surrounding the 3% to 4 foot diameter brown and dried circle. When Deputy Sheriff Breeden was asked for his impression and reputation of Marlett Sturgell in the community, he stated that \"he had known him all his life and had never known Marlett to do anything in this sense that would make him question his word. He seemed to be a very honest man, raised an honest family and has better things to do on his farm than to make up or dream up something like this if it wasn't true.\" When questioned about his personal thoughts on this investigation, Steve Breeden had this to say. \"In the course of my business we work with evidence. The evidence that 1 have compiled at the Sturgell farm leads me to believe that there has definitely got to be something — I don't know what — I'm not that smart — I can't answer that. I wish I could, but I do know there has got to be something that these people are seeing.\" Steve made a drawing of the landing site showing the large circle and the three smaller doughnut ringed circles that were in a tripod configuration, including the measurements. This case was first reported to the Center for UFO Studies on October 8, 1978, by the Sheriff of Barry County on the hotline number. Two different people from CUFOS responded by telephone the same evening and asked that \"the case be kept under wraps until an investigator could be dispatched to the scene.\" Mr. Sturgell literally cooperated to the degree that he spread a large tarp over the area to preserve it. Ted Phillips, a member of MUFON's Board of Directors from Sedalia, Mo., and a recognized authority on UFO landing trace cases, was directed by CUFOS to conduct an investigation as soon as conveniently possible. Ted visited the scene and conducted a very thorough one-day investigation on October 14th. MUFON's State Section Director and Assistant State Section Director for southwest Missouri were alerted to the case when it was reported in The Jop/in Globe newsletter on Tuesday, October. 24th. We responded on October 29th and performed an in-depth study that required several weekends for interviews and investigations, hereby being reported in the MUFON Journal. The.Barry Counfy Advertiser featured an article about the case and Ted Phillip's visit in their October 18th edition, with photographs. The vital specifics, details, and laboratory analysis follows.

An extensive set of black and white photographs were made at the site by Don Seneker with 8 x 10 enlargements. (Some of these photographs appear with this article.) Copies of the color Polaroid pictures by Deputy Sheriff Steve Breeden on October 8th are also on file for comparison purposes. George Koch obtained a large number of 35 mm color slides of the landing site in the pasture and the Sturgell home in relation to it. A 360-degree panorama photographic view of the entire area taken from the pasture in black and white was assembled, identifying the directions of the compass and depicting the ascension of the UFO and the 30 to 40 degree angle flight to the object 'hovering in the western sky (255 to 2% degrees azimuth). We meticulously obtained soil samples, fescue grass samples, cow feces, and bone samples from the site, plus samples of grass and soil outside of the circle for control purposes and comparison.

Plastic bags of grass samples were placed in a deep freeze at the home of George Koch to preserve them pending detailed examination. Radiation measurements were made at the site on October 28, 1978, using a Detectron Model DG-2 with the meter setting of 0.2 multiplier for full scale. The sample rate was set at fast. An extensive set of readings was made and tabulated within the landing site circle and extending out 44 feet in each direction. All measurements were made in milliroentgen per hour (MR- HR). The roentgen is the international unit of x-radiation or gamma radiation. Statistical average of the readings, sigma, and three sigma values were computed, and upper and lower control limits established. Based upon the individual readings and computations made, no significant radiation was „ detected within the 88-foot-diameter circle compared to the 4-foot-diameter area. Ted Phillips found no radiation in his measurements on October 14,1978. A synopsis of the grass samples collected at the site of the reported UFO landing is taken from the investigators report. Petri dish sample #2 was taken within the 3-foot- diameter dead grass area and petri dish #3 was collected .south of the dead area in the \"green\" area designated in this report (outer 10-12 inch ring). No unusual material was observed on the samples under a microscope, however, the green samples were about twice as large as the grass samples from the dead area, indicating dying or shrinking of the \"dead\" grasses. A lOx and 20x power binocular microscope was used and photographs made. (Laboratory detail is available from MUFON or the prime investigators.) The conclusion from the microscopic examinations is as follows: Samples were taken from the field on October 28, 1978 (20 days after the incident). They appeared visually normal except that the sample removed from the site had shrunk to approximately one-half their normal size and turned brown (dated November 1, 1978 by Donald L. Seneker). A preliminary physical evidence report on the soil samples completed on December 4,1978, from the Sturgell farm reports the following: (1) A preliminary report from Melvyn W. Mosher, Ph.D., Associate Director of the Regional Criminalistics Lab at Missouri Southern State College indicates no unusual substances or differences between the comparative samples submitted. (2) There are no volatile compounds present. (3) There are no microscopic differences of note. (4) Testing is not complete. A soil culture is being prepared along with other tests. (5) Reports will follow as completed. (George Koch is conducting his own tests of comparative growth of seeds in the control soil versus the circle soil).

George Koch placed a telephone call to Lonnie Nine of the National Weather Service in Monett, Mo., to check for balloon launchings from that location, since it is the closest such launching point to Jenkins, Mo. He was advised that their launch time is 6:00 AM C.D.S.T. and the balloon is normally in the air for 90 minutes or 110 minutes at the most. They ascend at a rate of 1,000 feet per minute and are normally visible up to 10,000 feet altitude. The balloon is made of Deer- Rex, an artificial rubber product that expands to about the size of four average rooms before bursting and dropping the red paper parachute with its instrument package. (A few years before, Mr. Sturgell had observed a balloon caught in the trees.) Further discussion tentatively eliminated other balloon launches by the military or other government agencies known to the National Weather Service. As part of this thorough investigation, Donald Seneker conducted a background and community reputation on Marlett Sturgell, an attitude, personality, and .habit evaluation plus an analysis of why he didn't see more details concerning the object in the pasture. In order to get a better idea of the shape of the object in the field, Mrs. Sturgell was asked to form a modeling clay replica of what she saw, since it was very difficult for her to sketch the unique shape. This technique proved valuable, since sketches and photographs were made from her model. (This very fine and well- documented report has been condensed so that it could be covered in its entirety in one issue of the MUFON UFO Journal. Don Seneker and George Koch are to be commended for the throughness of their investigation and the professional manner in which it was conducted.

MUFON"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"r Cosmic Search: A Review , \"Cosmic SEARCH, The first magazine about the Search for Extra-terrestrial Intelligence,\" (SETI), Volume 1, Number 1, January 1979. It is unusual to be reviewing an entire magazine, but in this case I feel sufficient reason exists to bend the reviewing rules, particularly since this publication is so close to home, and because I am reviewing the first issue of a publication which is bound to bring both praise and-ridicule from our varied UFO readership. This will be \"that first impression.\" This first issue cover depicts a portion of the metric scale with a pointer at 21 centimeters (the \"waterhole\") overlaid on the photograph of a galaxy and with a dashed line connecting the pointer with a particularly bright star. The editorial board includes some names that are familiar to the UFO reader. Under the table of contents is a statement to the effect that the publication intends to present all aspects of the Search for ETI in a responsible yet popular manner. The magazine is edited by Robert S. Dixon and John Kraus. In their first editorial they explain, in brief terms, what SETI is all about and that their intent is to provide interesting articles involving the many aspects of SETI. A second editorial is included by Richard Berendzen, a member of the editorial board. This editorial is probably the low point of the entire publication in that it takes pot-shots at those in the UFO community who prefer to search for ETI through the study and investigation of UFO reports. The first and second articles are historical in tone: the first is a reprint of the original article, by Guiseppe Cocconi and Phillip Morrison, \"Searching for Interstellar Communications,\" which appeared in NATURE in 1959. The second article is by Morrison and is titled \"Twenty years after. .' .\". He reminisces how the first came about and goes on to support the need for further work in this fascinating field. The third article, \"A Reminiscence of Project Ozma,\" by Frank D. Drake, 8 again adds historical perspective to the SETI. Five pages are devoted to a feature, \"The SEnTInel,\" which consists of highlights and up-to-date articles on today's discoveries and thinking. One item of particular interest is \"Protection of SETI 'Frequency Bands in Jeopardy\" wherein the reader is requested to write to the FCC or their elected representative in support of reserving SETI frequency bands. I thoroughly agree and feel the UFO com- munity should support such a stand. John Kraus, one of the editors, has included an educational feature, \"ABCs of SETI,\" which might be the beginning of an encyclopedia for certain aspects of UFO research. His four short discussions on \"The Galactic Perspective,\" \"The Cosmic Perspective,\" \"Numbers and the SETI,\" and \"The Wavelength Picture (The 'Waterhole')\" are bits of information that should come to the attention of every UFO enthusiast in order to keep our study in perspective. Walter Sullivan offers his article in the form of a question, \"What if we Succeed?.\" He embraces both the positive and negative philosophies of SETI, from Nobel-Prize-winning biologist George Walds' view that he \".. can conceive of no nightmare so terrifying. . .,\" to the opinion of a theologian that, \"... some of them (SETI) may be nearer to the divine mind than we are.\" If there are any political implications at all, it is that this magazine will be used as a lever before Congress to show how far this community of SETI researchers are separated from the UFO community. They resent our encroachment on their territory to the extent that their subtitle, \"The first magazine about the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence,\" makes a claim that I am sure many UFO publishers would dispute, showing their intention to ignore our existence. • This group, that is the majority of it, intend to avoid facing up to the question of the UFO, and those who study the UFO, except to attribute to us the capability of our work to detract from their congressionally appropri- ated funds. They fail to understand or give any hope to our aspirations of becoming a scientific endeavor, presently and historically with no public funding, while they are busy touting themselves as super-scientists who shall see us safely into the future, saving all manfind. They shall, as they have in this issue, continue to refer to us as the \"pseudo-science\" or \"those espousing disreputable UFO accounts.\" They present no evidence of having any real idea of what we are doing or what we are about, and fail to realize that our paths will surely cross, even though it is becoming more apparent that astronomy may have no association with UFOs. We should keep in mind that should we make any breakthrough in the study of UFOs that would lend any credence to an ETI-UFO connection, this is the same group of scientists who will demand that they alone be allowed to explore the implications of such a connection. They shall be the first to steal our smoke and our fire; and not even complain about burning their hands. It is well within their capability to. back-peddle into our work, with no apologies, no begging of our pardon, or any recognition of our existence. They view us as an unnecessary evil to be eliminated ' and shall attempt to intimidate us out of existence. Should they, list \"UFO\" in their glossary, I would think that the definition would not come near that of Dr. Hynek, but would in some way be a put-down to all we have worked toward. I would prefer that they stay off of our backs, but I doubt that will happen. Rather, I see that finally there' is a fraternity for Phil Klass to Join. (No doubt we will see his articles in this magazine.) Further, Cosmic SEARCH is a minor declaration of war on our efforts. Though it may not mean our doom, it may well set back our efforts of recognition. With this declaration we can but force ourselves to a new second wind, and to a cleaning up of our own act. We must thoroughly investigate (continued on page 17)"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"NEW ZEALAND FILM REPORT By Bruce Maccabee (Note: Dr. Maccabee travelled to New Zealand and Australia at the end of January to investigate the UFO film at the expense of Channel O in New Zealand. He has kindly provided a draft of his investigation report to MUFON for publication. Dr. Maccabee is Maryland State Director for MUFON, a Board Member of the Center for UFO Studies, and a Consultant to NICAP. He is a physicist specializing in optics for the U.S. Navy.--Editor) March 26, 1979, Press Release, New York City The investigation was conducted on behalf of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) by Dr. Bruce Maccabee, a Navy physicist. He spent ten days in New Zealand and a week in Australia interviewing the witnesses and analyzing the film. He subsequently presented his findings to several groups of scientists in the U.S. Not one of the scientists was able to explain the radar- visual-photographic sightings in conventional terms.... Dr. Hynek stated his opinion that the New Zealand evidence clearly suggests some phenomenon that cannot be explained in ordinary terms. He criticized those in responsible scientific positions who had publicly stated that the New Zealand film showed Venus, Jupiter, meteors, etc., without even bothering to talk to the witnesses, or to find out at what times and in which directions the various portions of the film were shot. Some of the other scientists joining Dr. Maccabee and Dr. Hynek in the opinion that the film shows something unusual are Dr. Peter Sturrock, a plasma physicist, Dr. Richard Haines, an optical physiologist, D r - Gilbert Levin, a biophysicist, and Neil Davis, an electronics specialist. Other scientists, most notably several government and industry radar specialists, requested that their names not be used because of their sensitive positions. Channel 0 of Melbourne intends to produce a documentary of the UFO sighting and the analysis of the film and radar detections. Channel O reporter, Quentin Fogarty, was aboard the plane when the UFO sightings took place. Mr. Fogarty was there with a film crew at the request of Channel 0 to obtain a story about previous early morning radar-visual UFO sightings that had taken place on the 21st of December, 1978. These sightings involved pilots who were flying between Wellington and Christchurch and also the Wellington Air Traffic Control radar. Wellington radar had picked up many anomalous targets east of the Clarence River and along the Kaikoura coast of the South Island of New Zealand. The pilots saw lights in the directions suggested by Wellington and at least in one case picked up a very rapidly moving object on the airplane radar at the same time they saw a flashing light fly past them. These sightings made front page headlines in New Zealand and Australia. Mr. Fogarty was on vacation in New Zealand when Channel 0 decided to assign the news coverage oh the previous UFO sightings. Mr. Fogarty contacted a cameraman, David Crockett, whose wife, Ngaire Crockett, operated the recording equipment. The Crocketts were unknown to Fogarty before this initial contact. Fogarty and the Crocketts interviewed and filmed the Wellington Air Traffic Control radar operators and one of the pilots involved in the previous sightings. By prearrangement, they boarded a similar newspaper flight to obtain background footage of takeoffs, landings, • etc., for use in the news coverage for Channel 0. Fogarty and the Crocketts did not know the pilot, Captain Bill Startup, nor did they know the copilot, Robert Guard, before the flight. The crew and passengers were in the four engine -turboprop Argosy aircraft flying south from Wellington with a full load of newspapers when the flight crew first noticed unusual lights in the direction of the Kaikour^ peninsula. The flight crew contacted Wellington radar and was told by the operator, Geoffrey Causer, that he had seen unusual targets in the direction the flight crew was looking. The flight crew pointed out the unusual lights to Fogarty and the Crocketts. David Crockett obtained a short segment of film footage of the lights seen on the way south. Wellington tower observed targets around the airplane, and, for a period of time, reported that there were targets behind, and beside, the airplane. For a period of several minutes the passengers saw a flashing light on the right side of the aircraft at about the same time that Wellington radar told them that some object was flying along with them. The plane landed at Christchurch at 1:00 a.m. local Daylight Savings Time about 50 minutes after the unusual lights were first seen. After the newspapers had been unloaded the airplane took off again to fly to Blenheim, New Zealand. On this flight a reporter from Christchurch, Dennis Grant, who was a friend of Fogarty, took the place of Ngaire Crockett, who didn't want to fly back through the area of the previous sightings. (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"(New Zealand, Continued) The original plan had been for Fogarty and the Crocketts to leave the plane at Christchurch, having obtained sufficient footage for the news coverage on the previous sightings. However, because of the incidents on the flight south, Fogarty and David Crockett decided to fly back to obtain better film of the unusual lights. The plane took off from Christchurch at 2:16 a.m. D.S.T. and climbed up through a low layer of clouds. As they broke through the clouds about 3 minutes after takeoff they saw a very bright light ahead and to the right. The captain, who compared it with a featureless full moon, turned on the airplane radar in the mapping mode. Several minutes later, when the radar warmed up and the plane was about 15 nautical miles (n.mi) out of Christchurch, the radar detected a strong target at about 20 n.m. in the direction of the bright light. As the plane flew northeast, the object remained to the right of the plane and the radar distance decreased to about 10 n.m. A considerable amount of film footage was obtained by Crockett during this portion of the flight. When the plane reached 13,000 feet, about 37 miles out of Christchurch, the pilot turned toward the object. After a 90 degree turn, however, the object was still not directly ahead, appearing to have moved to the right as the plane turned. The plane flew southeast for a minute or so, during which time the object appeared to be at a lower altitude and appeared to move to the right of the aircraft. When the pilot turned to the left to regain his original flight path put of Christchurch he was surprised to see the bright object, which had been on the right side of the plane, appear ahead of him. He thinks the plane then flew over it. They did not see the bright object again after they regained the original flight path. ! When the plane was east of Kaikoura, Wellington radar again said that there were targets around the plane. Several of these were apparently seen by the passengers and crew, and one brightly flashing light was filmed. 10 The film shows a light which oscillates rapidly from very bright white or yellow- white to dim red and orange. The plane landed about 3:15 a.m. Dr. Maccabee states that the film shot when the plane was 10 to 40 miles northeast of Christchurch shows a light that has various shapes including nearly round, sort of triangular, and \"bell- shaped.\" The bell-shaped image, obtained with a 240mm lens, has a bright bottom and a less bright top, in agreement with a description given at the time by the cameraman. Many of the images are over- exposed, suggesting a very bright yellowish-white light. An estimate of the brightness of the source,,if it were 10 n.m. away from the plane, shows that it could have been as powerful as several hundred thousand candlepower. Candlepower is a measure of the amount of visible light given off by a source of light. For comparison, a 100,000 watt incandescent bulb, radiating in all directions would have about 200,000 candlepower. Dr. Maccabee also stated that the sizes of the images on the film suggest a source which, if it were 10 n.m. away, would be about 100 feet wide. The scientists hope to be able to continue working on the film to determine further characteristics of the UFO. The Investigation Before summarizing the events and presenting certain analysis completed thus far, I would like to summarize the investigation and my part in it. When I first heard of the New Zealand film via ABC news on January 2,1 didn't think much of it. Then it was shown on CBS (Walter Cronkite took up about 5 minutes of Evening News time). Explanations were rampant and information was, as with most media- reported UFO cases, lacking. I took pictures of the TV screen so that I would have something to look at after the news show. (Little did I know that less than a week later I would have complete access to the original.) What was shown on TV looked interesting, but there was something wrong. The reporter's commentary did not seem to agree with the film, and the images would alternately be big and small. And, of course, there was a large amount of image motion (unlike Phil Klass, I immediately assumed that during the short times that images stood still they were showing single \"stopped\" frames). Although I didn't really think the film showed anything very conclusive (after all, as pointed out by Klass at the end of the CBS news segment, Venus was in the sky in the morning — no one knew what time the film had been shot). I did think the case was interesting, especially with the Wellington radar involved and the .on-the-spot recordings by the news reporter, so I said to myself \"Some lucky person at the other end of the earth — New Zealand — will get to look at the film, and, who knows. . . .maybe he'll find something.\" That was on Tuesday, January 2, 1979. On Thursday I got a phone call from Jack Acuff, former president of NICAP: \"An Australian news team is bringing the New Zealand film here for NICAP to investigate. Would you be willing to look at it?\" Within a second or less I had responded \"Yes,\" or words to that effect. I still wasn't that impressed with the case, especially because a day after this film had been obtained a New Zealand news crew had set up a camera on the bank of the Clarence River and had photographed a \"UFO\" for several hours. (That UFO was definitely VENUS!) Nevertheless, I didn't have anything to lose and besides, how often does one get to analyze an internationally famous UFO movie. I told Jack to suggest to the Australians that they wait a week so that I could get some photo interpretation equipment together (and so I could complete my practicing for a piano concert I was going to give the following weekend.) The next day Jack called and said \"They're on their way... .they'll be here Sunday.\" I saw the complete original film for the first time on January 8. It took me almost four microseconds to realize that I wasn't looking at Venus, or mating mutton birds, or light reflected from a cabbage patch. However, there were many hours of work on a copy of the film still ahead of me before I could rul out every source of light known to be in the area. In order to reach such a conclusion I had to talk to the"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"witnesses. By the end of January I had done about everything I could do on the film but I still hadn't talked to all the witnesses. I had talked to the pilot, cameraman, and Wellington Air Traffic controller by phone during the second week of January. The interview^ were arranged by Leonard Lee, the TV producer who had brought, the film from Melbourne, Australia where he worked for Channel \"O\" (as in O'Hare\" ... please avoid the term 'zero' \"). Channel O had commissioned the news reporter, Quentin Fogarty, to do a news story on a previous set of radar- visual sightings, and it was during his attempts to obtain background footage for his news story that \"the New Zealand film\" was obtained. . By the end of the third week in January I had decided that the film really did show something unusual, and I told Leonard confidentially that on a scale of 1-10 the probability that he had a \"UFO\" (something that.couldn't be identified) was about 11. By this time he was convinced that in order to reach a firm conclusion on this case it would be necessary to have me fly to New Zealand to interview the witnesses and possibly to refly the flight. He went back to Melbourne with this intent, but the TV station at first balked at the expense. Also during'the third week I showed the film copy to Robert Sheaffer, who agreed that whatever it was, it wasn't astronomical. It was quite amusing during those weeks in January to read of the rather positive identifications offered by the armchair experts. Venus was, of course, high on the list. One astronomer stated on the day after the sighting that he was 99% sure that the film showed Venus. Then after he saw the portion shown on TV he was \"99% sure it was Jupiter.\" Of course, by the end of the second week of January I knew that a major portion of the film had been taken about 30-45 minutes before Venus was due to rise (rise time was calculated by Brad Sparks of APRO). I also knew that the images were too large and too bright to be Jupiter. \"Meteors\" (Sir Bernard Lovell) were out of the question: the unusual lights were seen for many minutes. Mating mutton birds (flocks of birds that fly around the coast of New Zealand in the early morning) reflecting fishing boat lights? Light reflected from a cabbage patch? Comets? Balloons? Other Aircraft? Ground Lights? I was sure that the film showed none of these. Secret Military Maneuvers? Hoax? I didn't think so, but I couldn't prove it.. yet! During the last week in January I prepared for a trip that I only half believed would ever happen (even though Leonard was convinced it would happen). I had decided that I would pay my own way to Wellington — I could barely afford it — but I could not afford to go to Australia to interview the reporter himself. Then on January 26 the word came: the TV station will pay for everything! Two days later I was on a plane to California, where I had some image enhancements made and where I briefed Peter Sturrock and Richard Haines, and then off to New Zealand. Very briefly, I was in New Zealand for 10 days, during which time I interviewed 7 of the total of 8 witnesses involved. The taped interviews lasted anywhere from 4 to 8 hours at a session. The witnesses were all very friendly and helpful. I also talked to the RNZAF officer who directed the official government investigation into the sightings. He was convinced that they all resulted from misidentifications and highly unusual atmospheric conditions. He ruled out -the \"secret military maneuvers\" hypothesis and suggested that I talk to the scientists at the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR). These scientist had done the actual investigation, so I went to visit them. I took along the cameraman, David Crockett, because they had never talked to him. It turned out that even though the government report says that they talked to all the \"important witnesses,\" they in fact only talked to three people (pilot, copilot, ATC controller). Also, they had never seen the film that Crockett made. When I showed them my copy they were immediately interested. I went back to see them again before I left New Zealand, at their invitation. They told me about some unusual radar target properties that they had observed several nights after the film was made when they had an Air Force Orion aircraft available to look for \"UFOs.\" They told me about several apparently \"solid\" targets which disappeared from the radar scope seconds before the Orion arrived at the positions of the targets (note: the altitudes were not known, only the directions and distances)! What did the Orion find? Turbulence. (Did something depart suddenly?) From interviewing the witnesses I decided that the UFO film was not part of a hoax. Most of the witnesses had not know each other before the flight of the aircraft, and the government operated radar was involved. I was able to obtain a complete tape of the. ATC-airplane conversations. Unfortunately because of adverse publicity and \"fear\" of the RNZAF, the company which owned the aircraft would not allow me to refly the flight, even though the witnesses were willing to do so. After. New Zealand I flew to Australia where I interviewed Quentin Fogarty. .and did some work with the original film. I also collected the evidence together and wrote a history of the flight. By the time I left Australia I was sure that all the public explanations for the case were wrong. However, I did not publicize my conclusions. Instead, I presented the evidence to interested scientists in the U.S., including, Dr. Richard Haines, Dr. Peter Sturrock, Dr. James Harder, Neil Davis, Brad Sparks, Stan Friedman, and others at a meeting at Stanford University; Dr. J. Allen Hynek and Allan Hendry at CUFOS; Dr. Gilbert Levin of Biospherics in Rockville, Md., and about 10 government-related scientists (experts in optics and radar) who must remain unnamed because of the \"ridicule factor.\" No one offered a solution or even a combination of solutions that could fit the details. The results of the investigation were announced publicly on March 26 at a news conference in New York City that was organized by Channel O. At the conference Acuff, .Hynek, and I spoke for a total of about two hours. The bulk of the time was taken up by a recitation by myself of the history of the New Zealand film and the surrounding circumstances. The story made the science section.of the New York Times and some other papers scattered (continued on next page) 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"(New Zealand, Continued) throughout the U.S., but there was no big reaction. Unfortunately it was a bad day for news conferences because it was the same day that President Carter completed his \"cash for peace\" agreements with Israel and Egypt. Then, if that wasn't enough news for one week, two days later prospects for nuclear power nearly fizzled as the Three Rivers Plant spouted and the U.S. was confronted with an \"atomic terror\" for the next week and a half. Sources of Information The primary sources of information are the memories of the eight witnesses who were involved. These memories contain a wealth of information which, nevertheless, is \"soft information.\" However, this case is unique for the amount of hard information which was available after the events were over. The hard information includes a tape recording of the conversations between the Wellington ATC Center and the aircraft. This recording establishes an irrefutable time line for the events. Then there is the tape made on the aircraft by Quentin Fogarty (how many UFO sightings have information recorded in sifu?). Although this tape cannot be exactly synchronized with the Wellington tape, the approximate times of Fogarty's statements can be determined from the content (he occasionally repeated what Wellington had told the plane). Then there were scribbled pencil notes by Dennis Grant, the Christchurch, New Zealand, reporter. (He took the place of the cameraman's wife, Ngaire Crockett, on the trip north.) He was apparently the only one who actually wrote anything down during the sightings. And finally, there is the film, which is a veritable tour de force of UFO images. The film contains pictures of airport lights (landings and takeoffs), pictures of the airplane cockpit, pictures of Quentin Fogarty at Christchurch Airport, and pictures of.. . . UFOs. The landing light sequences and the cockpit sequences serve to establish that the film was taken from inside the aircraft. A study of the edge numbers of the original film (edge numbers are put on by the manufacturer) shows that they are continuous, except for a change in film at Christchurch (they needed a new roll for the journey north). Thus the film is not a hoax. The landing light sequences ' provide color and brightness information which can be used to calibrate the film and the optical quality of the airplane window. All of this hard information (acoustic and optical) is supplemented by the memories of five witnesses on the aircraft at any time and one or two witnesses at the Wellington ATC (two witnesses for part of the trip south; one witness at all other times). As the interviews proceeded I found that the statements of the various witnesses tended to complement rather than contradict one another. There were some variations in descriptions of events, etc., as might be expected from different observers after a time lapse of over a month, but I found no outright contradictions. To my surprise (and delight) almost every new \"bit\" of information I learned supported rather than contradicted the previous \"bits.\" From this wealth of information I have abstracted a summary of the events which, when read in conjunction with the \"Event Descriptions and Map Legend,\" will give the reader an overview of the New Zealand radar- visual UFO case. The associated maps, Figures 1 and 2, show the overall path of the aircraft as a dashed line. The T- shaped symbols represent the aircraft at various points along the path and the numbers refer to events in the \"Event\" sheet. The events are primarily those associated with radar targets referred to by Wellington ATC. Specifically, the location of the airplane each time Wellington referred to a target (or targets) is shown on the map. The locations are believed to be accurate to within 1 or 2 miles. The specific radar target(s) associated with a specific position of the airplane is (are) connected to the airplane symbol by a line(s). The events that occurred as the plane flew away from Christchurch (21- 27) are reconstructed from the witness ' statements about what they saw and what the airplane radar screen showed. The path of the plane from Event #25 to Event #27 is approximate and is subject to further revision. The path of the object was estimated from witness statements, airplane radar data, and from the image sizes on the film. The film image sizes (except when defocussed) are never larger than several milliradians in angular size. Assuming that the object was of a fixed size, this means that it never was closer than some minimum distance, probably about 10 miles, during the time it was being filmed. On the other hand Fogarty remembers looking almost straight down on the object out the right window (his last view of it), and the captain is quite certain that the plane passed over it. At these times the cameraman was not able to film it because it was moving rapidly with respect to the plane and because the film magazine and the overall size of his camera made it difficult to shoot at large downward angles (for example, the top of the film magazine could have bumped some of the overhead switches in the cockpit). The remainder of the airplane path (everything except 25-27) is reconstructed from the standard flight plans and from the memory of the Wellington Air Traffic Controller, Geoffrey Causer. To obtain a good impression of the bewildering number of unusual occurrences during those early morning flights I suggest that the reader read the summary first and then read the \"Event\" sheet, paying rather careful attention to the details of the events. Summary of Events (NOTE: all miles are nautical and times are local D.S.T.) FLIGHT SOUTH At 11:46 pm on December 30, 1978, a four-engine turbo prop Argosy freighter left Wellington, New Zealand, on a standard Saturday evening- Sunday morning newspaper delivery run, from Blenheim, New Zealand, to Wellington to Christchurch, and then back to Blenheim. Aboard the aircraft were the pilot, Captain Bill Startup, the co-pilot, Robert Guard, the Australian news reporter, Quentin Fogarty, and a film crew which consisted of a cameraman, David Crockett, and his wife, Ngaire, who operated the tape recorder. The reporter and film crew had been commissioned by a 12"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Melbourne TV station to fly tc Christchurch to obtain film footage for use in a news story about a previous UFO sighting that had been made by pilots on a similar aircraft flight. During the flight south the pilot and co : pilot observed lights that were first seen in the direction of Kaikoura, from a point just southeast of Cape Campbell (see map and Event Sheet). Coincidentally, Wellington radar picked up and reported targets which were in the vicinity of the plane. It appears that at least two, and perhaps several, of these anomalous radar targets were observed by the passengers on the plane. The cameraman obtained 16 mm color film footage of the inside of the plane, the lights of Kaikoura, and of anomalous bright objects that were seen occasionally in the 12:00 to 3:00 (front to. rightside) quadrant with respect to the direction of travel. The reporter recorded on-the-spot comments and descriptions and occasionally referred to statements made by Wellington Air Traffic Control (ATC). The anomalous lights seen on the trip south were observed to be mainly in the direction of Kaikoura or ahead of the plane, except for one, which was seen off the right wing after the plane was south of Kaikoura. Radar targets that were reported to the plane by the Wellington ATC within about 20 miles of the plane as it travelled from a point just south of Cape Campbell to a point about 57 miles northeast of Christchurch: The airplane radar was not used on the flight south. One particularly interesting sequence of events involving Wellington ATC occurred just after the plane had turned toward Christchurch at a non-geographic reporting point called \"Kaikoura East\" (see map). The plane had shifted to the Christchurch communication frequency when Wellington saw a target appear behind the plane about one or two miles (Event Sheet #12). ~ Wellington told' : the Christchurch controller, who asked the plane to shift back to the Wellington frequency. Wellington then told the plane that the target was about four miles behind, them. About half a minute later Wellington said there was a further target about four miles to the right of the plane. About 45 seconds after that Wellington told the plane that something was flying in formation with it. The plane and the unidentified target flew side by side for at least half a minute, after which the radar target reduced to that of the plane alone (Event Sheet # 15 and 16). About a minute later the plane contacted Wellington and reported a \"target,\" which was a flashing light, at the right of and falling behind the airplane (Event Sheet #17). Wellington agreed that there was a target at the right of the plane that was drifting behind as the plane moved forward. The plane landed at Christchurch, N.Z., at 1:01 a.m., December 31. While newspapers were being unloaded the crew discussed the sightings with the Christchurch radar operator, who described to the crew an anomalous target that was hot particularly impressive to him. In order to obtain more film footage, Crockett and Fogarty decided to fly back to Blenheim. One of the passengers, the wife of the cameraman, decided not to make the return flight and her place was taken by a reporter from Christchurch, Dennis Grant, a personal friend of the Australian reporter (the only person involved that the Australian reporter had known before the flight). FLIGHT NORTH The plane left Christchurch on its flight north to Blenheim at 2:16 a.m. About 3 minutes later, as the plane climbed through a low cloud cover, the pilot, co-pilot, and cameraman, who were all in the cockpit at the time, observed a bright yellow/white/orange light apparently at about their level, which would appear and disappear through the tops of the clouds. It was between 10 and 30 degrees to the right of the aircraft, which was flying northeast. This light was pointed out to the two reporters who arrived in the cockpit several minutes after the takeoff. The captain obtained a strong return from , his radar which was operated in its \"mapping mode.\" The size of the radar \"blip\" was estimated by the flight crew to have been 3 to 5 times larger than the blip from a large fishing boat. The flight crew and the Christchurch reporter, who had a good view of the radar display and of the object, repeatedly compared the direction of the bright light with that of the target as indicated by the azimuth markers on the radar screen. They assured themselves that the radar target and the bright light were in the same direction. The radar distance was initially 18-20 miles. As the plane proceeded along a straight northeasterly path and climbed to its cruising altitude, the distance to the bright light gradually decreased, as indicated by the radar,\" and the sighting line tended to move around to the right. By the time the plane was about 11 minutes (32 miles) out of Christchurch at an altitude of 11,500 ft. the bright light was about 70 to 90 degrees to the right of the aircraft (southeast of the aircraft) and about 12 miles away and no longer on the plane radar. All observers agreed that the object appeared to be at a lower altitude than the aircraft, with depression angles below horizontal estimated to be between 5 degrees and 30 degrees. The radar in the map mode could only pick up targets with depression angles between about 3° and 15° below the centerline of the aircraft. The cameraman obtained several minutes of film out the far right- hand cockpit window during this period. Images on the film range from yellowish white elliptical shapes with reddish fringes to overexposed, nearly triangular and circular shapes. Typical angular sizes were on the order of 1-2 milliradians.* He also obtained several feet of film showing a cockpit meter just below the image of the bright light. At about 12-13 minutes (35-38 miles) out of Christchurch the plane reached 13,000 feet and a speed of 215 knots. At this time the flight crew decided to turn to the right toward the bright light. As the plane turned, the sighting line to the object moved toward the front of the aircraft, but even after a turn of about 90 degrees, the object was not directly ahead of the aircraft, as if the object had moved to the right. The captain *Divide the distance to the object by 1000 and multiply by the number of milliradians to find the size. For example, an angular size of 1 milliradian corresponds to an object size of 1 foot at 1000 feet:.(1000 feet/1000)x(l millirad.) = 1 ft. (continued on next page,) 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"(New Zealand, Continued) proceeded in a straight line along a southeast heading and again the sighting line to the object moved from nearly directly ahead toward 90 degrees to the right as the plane flew. The depression angle below horizontal was apparently very noticable at this time. The object was not picked up on radar after the turn, even though the object was nearly ahead of the aircraft immediately after the turn, which suggests that the depression angle was greater than 15 degrees. After travelling on this new heading for 1 or 2 minutes, the captain began a turn to the left back toward his original flight path, at which time the light was observed to move quickly to the left-front and above the aircraft and then to the left and down and apparently below the aircraft. The object was not seen again after the plane completed its left turn. During the time that this object was seen by the plane passengers, it was not seen on the Christchurch or Wellington radars. This may have been because it was too low to be picked up by either radar and/or because it was a weak target for 50 cm radar. After the aircraft gained its original course and approached a point southeast of Kaikoura, Wellington control tower again began to call the attention of the flight crew to anomalous targets which were within 20 miles of the plane as it travelled toward Cape Campbell. Occasionally, unusual bright lights were visible in the directions indicated by the Wellington control, and in at least one instance the plane radar picked up a target that appeared to the captain to be in the same position as that indicated by Wellington control. There were also apparently temporal coincidences between appearances and disappear- ances of visual and radar objects. One particularly bright object that was seen as the plane approached Cape Campbell was photographed by the cameraman. The film shows a bright light which alternates in a regular, cyclic manner from bright white to dim red and orange. It apparently travelled in a series of loops, described as \"rolling and tumbling\" by the reporter (see Event #33).

Price: $8.95 One of the most fascinating— and quite probably important—books on the UFO subject to appear recently is \"The Andreasson Affair,\" and the author is the veteran UFO investigator Raymond E. Fowler, MUFON's Director of Investigations. The introduction is by Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Director of the Center for UFO Studies. This book is the culmination of more than a year's intensive inquiries by the author and his associates, among whom is my colleague, David Webb, co-chairman of MUFON's Humanoid Study Group. It is the extraordinary story of Betty Andreasson, much of which emerged through numerous hypnotic regression sessions conducted by Dr. Harold J. Edelstein, Director of the New England Institute of Hypnosis. It describes her confrontation in 1967 with a group of bizarre entities in her South Ashburnham, Massachusetts, home; her subsequent experiences on board the beings' vehicle; and her incredible trip to some Magonian realm with its climactic encounter which can only be described as an ecstatic religious experience. Betty Andreasson seems to be, according to exhaustive background checks, an honest and straightforward person; moreover, she is blessed with keen observational acuity and artistic ability, and the book contains numerous examples of her illustrations. Let the unwary reader be forewarned: this is very special stuff. We are fortunate in having Mr. Fowler to present such controversial material, for his reputation as one of America's most competent and knowledgeable UFO investigators gives the Andreasson story authority and credibility that less expert hands could not manage. Even so, the story assails our credulity. There is no abduction report or onboard experience that quite equals the Andreasson affair in all its breadth and scope, its detail and complexity. Comparisons will be made, of course, to the Hill case, and to Travis Walton's abduction in 1975. There are similarities in each case but, jut as important, there are differences. Still, none has been so exhaustively examined and so thoroughly documented as has the Andreasson case, and certainly none has produced the rich expanse of detail and nuance that we find in Mr. Fowler's engrossing book. heavy going for readers not reasonably well-grounded in the subtleties of high- strangeness UFO case material. In all fairness, its contents do confound reason. The book will most certainly send the professional skeptics scurrying madly off to their respective editors and publishers in their efforts to reduce it to an absurdity. This is understandable, for if the Andreasson story is authentic, the implications of this fact are staggering. What if, for example, there are thousands of other Betty Andreassons around the country, the world, just waiting, like so many time bombs, to \"go off?\" Information in the files of the Humanoid Study Group suggests that this possibility — at least in part — may not be so farfetched as some of us would like to believe. High strangeness cases like Andreasson's tend to contain the elements of their own protective invisibility by the very outrageousness of their contents. Even so, in my own work with regressive hypnosis, my colleagues and I have discovered that \"on-board\" experiences are not all that rare. What is really going on in such cases, of course, remains to be determined. Mr. Fowler's book, however, provides the reader with the definitive example of the genre, in all its most perplexing detail. The book is not without some flaws. A good portion of it is composed of parts of taped transcripts of the hypnotic sessions. Excerpted, these segments tend to be too fragmentary to sustain the effect of the complete testimony. I have heard nearly all of the taped regressions and they are tremendously compelling; I have also had a copy of Mr. Fowler's massive, three-volume report, the impact of which, by sheer weight alone, is undeniably impressive. It would be impractical,'of course, to expect such a gargantuan product in a commercial publication. .But like some of Eugene O'Neill's good, later plays, we are overwhelmed not so much by the parts as by the accumulated force of the whole work. The published version of Mr. Fowler's report simply lacks the power and muscle of the original. This is, naturally, nit-picking by the specialist. Most readers of the book will not have the benefit of the comparison, and the published account is nevertheless quite sinewy and stunning in its own right. The reasonable reader will come away persuaded that something quite mysterious is going on here. Whether the source of the mystery is actually extraterrestrial intervention (whatever that condition might entail), as it literally appears, or whether something else is really going on, it matters little. Mr. Fowler's account of the Andreasson affair convincingly demonstrates that there is a particular phenomenology in operation here; that it is typical in many ways of many other similar experiences; and that it is time for responsible professional people to begin making inquires into what it is that is going on. Mr. Fowler only briefly mentions the extended period that elapsed from the time that Betty Andreasson wrote her letter to the Center .for UFO Studies to the actual commencement of the investigation 17 months later. It would be useful to get the facts of the situation into the record. Betty wrote her letter to the Center on August 20, 1975, where it remained until early in 1976 when Margo Metegrano, who was then the Center's \"-administrative assistant, sent me the original. I took one look at it and put it away in my \"unfinished business\" file; it had been sufficiently off-putting for me to let it repose there until the following August. At that time I received a letter from David Webb in which he remarked that there was a new MUFON investigator (Jules Vaillancourt) in Ashburnham, Massachusetts. The name of the town rang a bell and sent me back to my files, where I found Betty's letter.

Webb told me later that he had been reluctant to refer the case to the investigator as his first assignment. Betty's letter is not even reprinted in the book—a serious oversight. It is unlikely that Mr. Fowler would have omitted it from his submitted text, as it is a most important document. Can it 16 be that the editors at Prentice-Hall suffer from the same myopic bias that afflicts Hynek, Bloecher, and Webb? How many other letters like this might there be stuffed away in various personal and organizational files around the country? The world? Mea cu/pa: I have just re-examined my own faithful repository for \"unfinished business\" and I confess that there are at least a half-dozen unattended letters right here.

BOOK REVIEW A Helicopter-UFO Encounter Over Ohio, by Jennie Zeidman (Center for UFO Studies, 1609 Sherman Ave., Rm. 207, Evanston, IL 60201) 122 pages, $9.00 including postage & handling. During the Fall 1973 UFO wave a structured UFO \"buzzed\" the helicopter commanded by Captain (now Lt. Col.) Lawrence J. Coyne of the Army Reserve and shone a green light into the cockpit. In this well-written and well-organized report, the author has done an admirable job of assembling the testimony, analyzing the. appearance and behavior of the UFO, studying the anomalies that occurred during the sighting,, and comparing the case with others that are somewhat similar. The report is amply illustrated with photographs, diagrams, maps, and charts that supply technical data about the helicopter and other explanatory iMarkR.Herbstritt Astronomy Notes THE SKY FOR MAY 1979 Mercury — Early in the month, it can be seen with very great difficulty, low in the east at sunrise, but by the 29th, it is in superior conjunction.

One perplexing omission in this regard is a photograph or diagram of the front window arrangement that might help to evaluate the significance of Lt. Jezzi's discrepant testimony. Nowhere is this question confronted directly, except for the inadequate suggestion that his view was \"obstructed.\" Why, and by what? Lt. Jezzi failed to observe the two salient features of the UFO as reported by the others: its distinct structure and the green beam of light. Yet he was in the left front seat looking out of a large windshield panel (see Figure 3). Sgt. Yanacsek, who was seated to the right rear (behind Coyne) said the object \"...easily filled up the entire windshield. If I had been sitting in the front seat I probably wouldn't have been able to see anything but the aircraft, or whatever it was.\" (p. 27). Sgt. Healey, seated to the left rear (behind Jezzi) and looking down the aisle between pilot and co-pilot, said \"...it appeared to take up the entire—both—front windows.\" (p. 24). Nothing in Figure 3 explains why Jezzi should not have been able to clearly see an object so large and so apparently close once it hovered in front of the helicopter, nor especially why he failed to see the green beam of light. His view to the right was obstructed during the object's approach, but unless he closed his eyes (continued on next page) 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"(Director's Message, Continued) reporting the Lawrence Coyne helicopter case in this 122 page paperback (8% x 11) book. Richard Hall has reviewed the report for the Journal. Warren Nicholson, State Sectipn Director for the Columbus, Ohio area and William E. Jones, Field Investigator, were instrumental in locating and interviewing ground witnesses. It was my privilege to have shared the podium with Jennie at the 9th Annual MUFON UFO Symposium in Dayton, Ohio, when she related this significant case. Ann Druffel's column \"California Report\" in the November-December 1978 issue of the Journal is a book review of the Etherean Invasion by John de Herrera. At least four subscribers have written to.MUFON reporting that their checks had been returned and a form letter was enclosed stating \"Thank you for your order. Due to difficulties beyond our control, the book is not presently available for sale.\" (signed Hwong Publishing Company, 10353 Los Alamitos Blvd., Los Alamitos, CA 90720.) Your Director has written to Mrs. Druffel to inquire about the problem and if the book is available elsewhere. On Friday, April 20,1979, Senator Harrison H. (Jack) Schmitt (R.-New . Mexico) and a former astronaut chaired a panel of inquiry into the cattle mutilation cases currently disrupting rural areas of northern New Mexico. It was convened at the Public Library in Albuquerque, N.M. with the following MUFON people' planning to attend: Tom Adams, State Section Director, from Paris, Tex.; Richard B. Caudell, Acting State Director for New Mexico, from Albuquerque; Thomas P. Deuley, former State Section Director from North Carolina and now living in Ft. Meade, Md.; and David L. Perkins, State Section Director for Colorado from Farisita. This very important meeting may disclose whether UFOs are involved in some cattle mutilation cases. A round silent aircraft with a searchlight aimed at the ground, hovering only 50 feet above the terrain, was observed by police officers on April 9, 1979, near where animals were later found mutilated. Tests made on live animals by Gabe Valdez, State Police Officer in charge of the investigation, using ultraviolet light, disclosed that some animals had a powder substance on their hides that was composed of two rare earth elements and one\" transitional metal. According to the Schoenfeld Research Labs in Albuquerque, N.M., this powder was identical to the substance deposited upon a pickup truck by a hovering UFO. MUFON has amassed a large file by state on these mysterious events in an effort to determine if they are UFO .related. A report by one or more of the attendees to the April 20th meeting will be .published in the MUFON UFO Journal. Another phenomenon that might be related to UFOs is the appearance of the Bigfoot or Sasquatch creature throughout the world. For further information on this specialized aspect, we suggest that you write to Bigfoot- Sasquatch Information, P.O. Box 3035, Seattle, WA 98114, who publish a monthly newsletter. The MUFON Journal has been receiving the NASA News, which consists of a series of news releases concerning the activities, announce- ments, contracts, and technical advances of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Excerpts from this publication will be published whenever the subject matter is applicable. You will note from the cover of this issue, Number 135-May 1979, that the Journal is now current. This has been accomplished through the aid of three double-monthly issues, Numbers 132, 133, and 134, and the wonderful patience of our members and subscribers. Everyone will still receive twelve issue numbers for their annual • subscription as previously announced. The National Enquirer UFO Blue Ribbon Panel and the Mini-Panel met in 'a combined meeting in Mexico City on March 13, 1979, to select their outstanding UFO case for 1978. First prize went to two Charlotte, N.C. police officers Ron Arey, pilot, and Howard Dellinger, officer, and F.A.A: Control Tower Operator Ray Bader for their radar-visual case involving a police helicopter. This case was submitted by MUFON, reported by investigators P. Wayne Laporte, Henry Morton, Jr., David Oldham, and George D. Fawcett, and edited by Walt Andrus in the December 1977 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal, Number 121. A second award was presented to police officers in Semi Valley, Calif., for their sighting experience. (Helicopter, Continued) at the moment of presumed collision, it would seem that he should have seen the UFO as the others did at its closest point. This discrepancy does not seriously detract from the consistent testimony by the others but it does remain a puzzle. Another bothersome point is in Appendix C where it is stated that Coyne received a phone call from the Army Surgeon General's Office from a \"metaphysician\" who inquired about Coyne's dreams. Coyne did report having unusual dreams, including one about an out-of-body experience. So did Sgt. Healey, it turns out, except that he attributes multiple phone calls to \"the Pentagon\" and states that Coyne sent periodic written reports about the after-effects to the Pentagon. Since when is \"metaphysics\" a legitimate medical discipline, and how do we know that the caller was authentic? To whom did Coyne mail written reports as alleged by Healey? The reader is left, dangling about this intriguing turn of events and the many unanswered questions it raises. The case itself is clearly established as a highly significant one by the overwhelming weight of evidence; the testimony by ground witnesses literally adds a new and important dimension to the sighting. There can be little doubt that a \"real\" UFO was present, and that its explanation as a conventional aircraft or as a meteor (a strained hypothesis to begin with) is untenable, as the author notes. A thorough review of these hypotheses is presented in Chapter II. The report is an outstanding contribution to the literature and could serve as a model for badly needed compilations and analyses of evidence in numerous other important cases.
