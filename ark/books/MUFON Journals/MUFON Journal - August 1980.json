FROM THE EPITOR The contributions in this issue from Australia, Japan, and other countries around the globe help to demonstrate that UFOs are an international matter of concern. Also, we have it on reliable authority that the People's Republic of China is organizing a UFO conference for exchange of information tentatively scheduled for late 1980. The Center for UFO Studies has just published a statistical analysis of UFOs in Russia prepared by the Soviet Academy of Sciences (see Lou Parish's column). And, the official French government group, GEPAN, sent a representative to the Houston, Texas, MUFON Symposium in June. During July, Quentin Fogarty — head of the news media crew involved in filming objects also seen visually and detected on radar in New Zealand late in 1978 — visited in Washington, D.C., and met most of the MUFON personnel in the area. Considering all the UFO events \"down under\" in recent years, and the high quality of investigation and reporting emanating from that quarter, we dedicate this issue to our antipodal colleagues, and to the hope of a truly international pursuit of the truth.

The writer is a scientific consultant for the Australian Co- ordination Section for the Center for UFO Studies and Director of UFOR (NSW), Lane Cove, NSW, Australia.) Interactions with the UFO phenomenon have occurred at many levels. The most compelling for science are those that are readily amenable to traditional scientific method. The areas of physical evidence and traces are one case in point 1 , however other types of accounts seem to be opening up new vistas. One such area of enquiry is where the percipient of the UFO experience does not have a total recall of events. The oversea experience has noted this loss of total recall or memory loss in several types of UFO events. These have been mainly in the contact and so-called abduction genre. Their validity has been a subject of considerable debate, but this is a theme I will return to later. Until recently it has been noted, that upon first inspection, \"we appear to have a complete absence of time loss, 'abduction' contact cases. Keith Basterfield, myself and others have demonstrated that Australia does have a considerable body of entity accounts, and yet none of them demonstratively show 'contact' aspects about them. It can be shown that Australia has a large body of evidental cases of the peripheral 'contact* type. Here I am referring to the situation where a witness encounters a UFO, an entity or some kindred manifestation, and then some manner of interaction takes place, either in an objective or subective way.\" 2 - 3 I indicated only 2 years ago that: \"While we lack contemporary cases which demonstratively show among other things the elements of abduction, contact and time lapse, Australia, unbeknown to most researchers enjoyed a rich indigenous tradition of similar accounts. Here I refer primarily to the tribal initiation accounts of aboriginal medicine men — men of \"high degree\" as A. P. Elkin aptly puts it.* These aboriginal \"shaman\" have a powerful and consistent tradition of ritualistic initiation, the elements of which bare amazing similarities to many modem day UFO abduction and contact accounts.\" 4 \"Thus while a hidden body of data of the contact, abduction and time- lapse variety may exist in Australia today, we really only have a few cases which in certain aspect reflect these factors as well as remarkable aboriginal tradition of such cases. The latter because of their mystical shamanistic framework really eludes definitive correlations with the contemporary UFO contact tradition.\" 5 In a manner often disconcertingly characteristic of the UFO subject, our enquiries exhumed a number of antipodean cases of the \"interrupted journey\" genre. By way of an interesting synchronicity, the first of these (1971 - Gladstone) came to my notice at the time I was highlighting the apparent absence of such cases 6 and early in the following year (1978) I was caught up in an extended and ongoing investigation of another (1978 - Bakers Creek Falls). Since then a small but fascinating body of \"interrupted journeys\" has surfaced. The presence of such stimuli as the film \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" and the burgeoning literature on the theme cannot be clearly viewed as a •It is with much sad ness that I note the passing of Professor Eton this year. While he is no longer with us his extraordinary work on indigenous folklore and Australian aboriginal culture, will no doubt, be timeless. cause for the appearance of these cases. Two of the cases to be presented occurred before the publicity that accompanied the advent of \"CE3K.\" What follows is a sampling of the \"interrupted journeys\" that have appeared. Part I will describe these case and Part II will try and make some sense out of them. PART I: AUSTRALIAN \"INTERRUPTED JOURNEYS\" CASE ONE: Gladstone- Rockhampton, Queensland, 1971. 7 After finding out about this case in 1977 (I and others had heard many rumors of a \"teleportation\" or \"Hill\" type case in the Gladstone area for a number of years previous to this), two years of investigation took my enquiries from Queensland to Western Australia, than as far afield as Finland and Sweden, to finally return to Queensland. I finally managed to catch up with the original witnesses and although my enquiries are still continuing, I am confident that what follows is an accurate representation of what happened. On the night of August 1, 1971, a Finnish couple, Ben and Helen K.*, were returning home after visiting friends. The couple left Gladstone soon after 11:35 p.m., having found no petrol stations opened. They were very low on petrol, but decided to risk the trip to Rockhampton, hoping to find an open petrol station in one of the small centers on the way, before they ran out of fuel. The night was foggy and dark. By midnight they had arrived at Calliope River. After passing over the bridge and beginning to travel along the straight stretch of road that followed, they were next aware of seeing a Caltex station on the left side of the road, north of Mount Larcom, some 20 miles beyond the *Names and address on file (not for publication)."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"(Australia, Continued) Calliope River bridge! The station was closed, but after driving some 50 yards past it, Ben K. became aware that he could see \"a green light at the level of the treetops\" in the rear view mirror. His wife confirmed the presence of 2 green lights. Then Ben K. said: \"Suddenly we had a feeling that we had been driving straight forward all the time. The road seemed straight, foggy, and surrounded by trees (in this area the roads are usually winding). And we had a feeling that we were repeating the same words over and over again. We thought we should have been arriving at Mount Larcom.\" Suddenly the couple saw a light to their left and above them a circle of lights similar to the lights on a merry-go- round or carousel. The next thing they saw was the Port Alma road sign, some 40 miles north of Calliope River. Immediately after this observation, the couple found themselves at a railroad crossing outside Rockhampton, about 20 miles from Mount Morgan. Ben K. indicated: \"We wondered how we had managed to get so far and why we had not seen any villages on the way. We should have seen at least four of them. We felt that something strange had happened to us. We were afraid. I took a rifle out of the trunk and loaded it. We drove to Rockhampton with the rifle on my knees. Our dog Candy who usually sleeps on the back seat was afraid and wanted to come to the front seat.\" In the middle of Rockhampton, the couple found an open petrol station. It was there that the bizarre nature of the trip really struck home. They were shocked to find that the time was only 15 minutes past midnight! Only 40 minutes had passed since they had left Gladstone. At the average speed the couple estimated they were driving, some 35 to 40 mph, the trip time would have been in excess of an hour, probably closer to 2 hours. It seemed that the couple covered the distance in almost half the required time and on top of that had no conscious recollection of passing through any villages. They only remembered the Caltex station and the Port Alma road sign. The service station attendant in Rockhampton became very interested at that. Then peculiar things were discoverd on the car. The couple's car (1971 Valiant sedan) was covered with a very thin film of odorless oil. The attendant could not identify it but suggested it would be used on \"very fine machinery unknown to him.\" In the corners of the oil covered bonnet (hood - Ed.), 4 round marks, two in each rear corner, were noticed. All were identical, being one eighth of an inch wide and 9 inches in diameter. In the middle of each circle there was a spot — a one inch solid circle. Oil traces ran in 2 stripes from the circles towards the nose of the car. A defect in the duco, described as being burnt, was found on the right hand side front of the bonnet (viewing site from in front of the car) above the headlight. The mystery deepened as the number of people gathering around the car in curiosity, grew. Ben K. said: \"After a while another driver came to the station. He said he had passed us before the Calliope River. He couldn't understand how we could have arrived at Rockhampton before him.\" \"Finally we went to the police station and told our story. But the young officer said (after examining the oil and marks on the bonnet): 'All I can say is that I have often fallen asleep at the steering wheel and waken up after a 200-300 mile'.\" Beware of somnambulistic police officers in the Rockhampton area! The couple wanted to contact the local newspaper but at that hour it was closed. They drove around Rockhampton for a while, with their car drawing stares whenever they stopped. In an effort to reconcile in their own mind what happened, Ben K. states: \"Slowly it dawned on us what happened. As we were so concerned about the petrol situation, UFOs lifted us from Calliope River past Mount Larcom to the Caltex Service Station, and from there during a second lift via Port Alma Junction to the railway crossing a couple of miles from Rockhampton.\" (That's an excellent solution to the petrol crisis today.) \"We continued our trip around 3 o'clock and had 300 miles of foggy driving ahead of us. We were wishing that UFOs would have come and help us again, but that didn't eventuate. During the following day we did inspect our car more carefully and thought that the paint work had burned, lifting off in flakes. This wan't the case; as the oil mixed with dust had started to dry up it produced this flaking. We tried and found out the mixture of 'oil and dust' was water soluble. ...\" The experience on the night of August 1 - 2,1971 changed the couple's life to a degree. They subsequently saw a number of UFOs and Helen K. had several possibly related experiences of telepathy (one in relation to a UFO event 8 and precognition. An analysis was done on the \"burnt\" spot on the bonnet by Finnish UFO researchers and it was concluded that the site came in contact with extreme heat. Hypnotic regression was also attempted on the couple, however, nothing further was elicited. Each time induction and recall of that evening was attempted, they would begin to shake violently. The hypnotist gave up the attempt. 9 CASE TWO: Moonie, Queens- land, 1977. 10 The \"Balonne Beacon\" newspaper of St. George, Queensland, described the following odd events in its March 17,1977 edition. The details may be germane to our enquiries. The incident took place in a very isolated locale, with only scattered homesteads: 'Two travellers from Brisbane report an unnerving experience when they came under the attention of a UFO near Moonie last night. Jennifer Hands and Michael Noonan had pulled up about 10:30 for an hour's sleep a few miles this side of the township. Jennifer woke to find the lights of their vehicle on, and asked Michael to switch them off. About 12:30 the lights were on again, but the battery was flat. Both people reported a weird sensation: on awakening they felt they should not open their eyes, and are convinced they could not have done so anyway, as some force was holding them immobile. The weird electrifying sensation can't be described,' they said. Eventually, when they did open their eyes, a strange object with flashing lights was hovering some distance away. This rose and also moved sideways before zooming off on the approach of a truck, which clutch-started their vehicle, which from there to St. George ran very (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"(Australia, continued) erratically. \"The generator and lights would stop working and then come good again, the temperature gauge would rise high and then fall back to cold. Michael said it was hard to control at times, as though a sideways force was being exerted on it. There were also unexplained noises in the back (its a covered ute) and in the panel work. On arrival at St. George, they parked on a service station forecourt and Jennifer wrote a letter to her mother telling of the experience. As a joke, they looked up, and high overhead they could see several UFOs among the stars. Michael said near where they saw the hovering UFO there was a very acrid smell, similar to that when a number of car batteries are being charged in a confined area. They also found a strange piece of material under the bonnet. This has been given to the police, to whom they have reported their experience.\" Apparently several local residents also saw strange objects in the sky shortly before midnight. It is perhaps only coincidental that the truckdriver who assisted the young couple, with a push-start, apparently indicated that his truck \"did not behave as well\" after the incident. 11 It is of interest that the St. George area has long been a center of UFO activity and came into prominence more recently with the \"shoot-out\" incident. 12 CASE THREE: Bakers Creek Falls, NSW, 1978.« I described the strange experience of Gary P.* on the Old Grafton Armidale road, during January 1978, in detail in UFO Research (NSW)'s publication, \"Australian UFO Newsletter\" 14 , thus only a summary will suffice here. During the early hours of January 10, 1978, Gary P. observed two UFOs about 10 miles out of Grafton, along the Old Armidale Road. One of the objects approached and seemed to be slowly moving down the side of a mountain side. It seemed to periodically issue a \"shower of sparks.\" This sighting apparently lasted for about 20 minutes. It is the interim journey, that follows, that is of interest here. Gary P. found himself in his Kombi stopped on *Narne and address on file (not for publication). the road, at about 5 a.m. To his left was an incredibly bright object, hovering some distance away in the direction of Bakers Creek Falls. How is it, that he found himself in this position. I quote from my report: \"Mr. P.'s perception of time from leaving Grafton, up until he finds himself at Bakers Creek Falls — a distance of about a hundred miles — is certainly not clear. He thought the first sighting out of Grafton occurred a long time out of Grafton, but apparently after retracing his route he is certain that it occurred only about 10 minutes out of the town. He thought it was only a few minutes after leaving the first UFO sighting behind that he saw \"a group of hunters\" gathered around a fire beside the road, but his reconstruction upon returning along that road, places these \"hunters\" a good % hour in time after this. Then he felt it was 10 or 15 minutes before he finds himself at Bakers Creek Falls. His second trip along that road put it at about an hour and a half. In fact he cannot even recollect driving the distance between seeing the \"hunters\" and turning up at Bakers Creek Falls. Although it is common for people to drive long distances without recollection of the trip, this particular road would seemingly preclude it. For much of its distance it is dirt gravel surface, which winds its way up into plateau country. The road twists and turns and even when it finally gives way to a bitumen surface, it still requires complete attention to travel it safely. Having driven up and down this road many times myself, I find it astonishing that someone, not having travelled it before, would not have a vivid memory of a fairly bad road. In fact without recall to total faculties, I would expect that a weary traveller would instead find himself parting company with the road in many places....\" Mr. P's recollection of the hunters and the surrounding locality may place it at Tyringham — a small community about halfway between Grafton and Armidale. Here in 1973, I investigated what appears to have been one of the most intensive UFO flaps ever experienced in Australia 15 . Mr. P. did not stop and share his adventure with the \"hunters\" as he felt he may have been ridiculed and the hour may not have been amenable to safe roadside meetings with strangers. Shortly after this he recollects seeing \"the same thing again — these yellow objects out in a paddock,\" but he was not certain. He continued on without any recall of what happened until just outside Armidale, at Bakers Creek Falls. My interview with Mr. P. tells what happened: \"What happens was, next recollection was that I'm stopped on the side of the road, and I'm looking out to the left this time, and what I'm looking at is an incredibly bright...what I thought was a chicken farm... And I'm looking at this thing and I was watching it for a good 10 minutes and there was nothing happening....! just couldn't believe it, just how bright this thing was....and I was about to take off....I actually lined this — the chicken coop — (this thing) what I actually saw, was that the chicken coop moved!\" After a lengthy diversion with an uncooperative \"witness,\" Gary P. set off into the paddock to get closer to the extraordinary object he was seeing. However as he got nearer, the object seemed to retreat into the extensive fog that surrounded it. Gary P. eventually found his way to the Falls area and saw the fog retreating out of the ravine. Suddenly the fog stopped and P. was shocked to then see that the fog was now returning along its original path towards him. It quickly enveloped him reducing visibility to less than 10 feet. The return of the fog was accompanied by a sound similar to that of a vacuum cleaner. A column through the mist could be made out above him where he could see the sky. The fog then quickly dissipated along with the sound, leaving P. alone at the falls. He waited until morning then returned to the car. Standing at the car P. noticed what he described as 2 \"shockwaves\" one minute apart, which was like the whole area was suddenly shaken. Then normality; 7:05 a.m. and morning. For further details on Gary P.'s experience I direct you to my report. 16 . CASE FOUR: Balodonia, Western Australia, 1978. 17 A 30-year-old male truck driver experienced the following events, while driving east of Baladonia, (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"(Australia, Continued) at about 4 a.m., February 5, 1978: \"While driving west approximately 20-30 miles east from Baladonia, I observed a large spotlight coming towards me, coming from the west going east. I thought it was another vehicle, so I put my high beam on and off several times, but the other light did not change. Then I could see a large diamond-shaped light coming towards me (No. 1). It had red, blue, green and yellow lights reflecting off the road directly below it. The white light momentarily blinded me, so I don't know whether it went directly overhead or veered to one side of me. Then I stopped the truck and got out. But couldn't see anything. After a couple of minutes I started driving again. I started looking around when I noticed a round dull white light (No. 2) or object on my right hand side which was approximately 2-3 inches in diameter, also travelling the same speed as my truck. I then stopped and the object stopped. I started driving again, then the object moved again. Then it disappeared when I drove into Baladonia. About five minutes, it reappeared on my left hand side. I stopped, then another truck stopped which was coming from the west to see if I was alright. I asked if he could see anything, but the object had disappeared. \"I started driving, then it reappeared left again. I switched my truck headlights off (while driving) then the object went from a round shape to an elongated shape (No. 3) which was approximately 17 inches by 8 inches high. It was a dull white colour with black segments (windows?). About one or two minutes later I switched my headlights on again, then the object disappeared. About '/ 4 to '/ 2 an hour later, it reappeared on my right hand side as a round shape again. About 4:30 a.m. as the sky grew brighter, the object disappeared.\" This account is fairly interesting from a number of points, but we also find that the driver experienced \"a lapse of memory\" for approximatley 3 - 3'/ 2 hours, immediately preceding the UFO event. There are some gaps in this account due to illegible parts of the original account \"When I left Boarder Village I was fully clothed. When I drove past through Nidura, but I coun't remember anything between and  miles east of Baladonia, except for, I remember talking to somebody about inventing something (somebody wanted me to take credit for their invention, but I wouldn't agree) also I remember speaking with 2 voices. Next thing I remember was 4 miles east of Baladonia, where I stopped my truck to refuel it, when I noticed that I still had on my tee-shirt and Amco jacket and only my jockets, but my shorts were elsewhere in the truck cab. I didn't pick up any hitch hikers or have anybody else with me on the trip from east to west.\" CASE FIVE: Lawitta, Tasmania, 1979. 18 A young man was driving through Lawitta, near New Norfolk, at about 9:50 p.m., on February 5, 1979, when the bonnet of his car was lit up by an intense white light from overhead. The car radio went dead, the lights went out and the engine stopped. Later that night the man was found by police in a Hobart city street. They went to speak to him because he had no lights on his car. The man did not know who he was, where he had come from, or where he lived. The police searched him, found his address on personal papers and took him home. The man boarded with friends who took him to Royal Hobart Hospital, where he was said to be suffering from shock. He had a high pulse rate. When doctors shone a light into his eyes, the young man started to recall what had happened at Lawitta. he stated that after the car stalled he spent 10 to 15 minutes trying to get it started. He could not recall driving to Hobart. The man declined to get involved in any further investigations. PART II: \"INTERRUPTED JOURNEYS\" - THE TRADITION, THE PRE- SENT, AND THE FUTURE The Australian events described in Part I and others 19 seem to relfect a variation of the far better documented close encounter cases. Some of them hint at being the stuff of \"abduction\" stories and such purported \"alien interactions\" seem to hold considerable prominence, particularly in the Americas. The stature that such accounts hold can be directly attributed to the famous Hill case 20 , which largely established the \"abduction\" precedent, in contemporary times. Considerable and diverting work has been carried out on historical antecedents of worldwide folklore. 21 . The story told by the Hills incorporates a close encounter, a period of \"time-loss\" and an attendant mystery. The nature of the events that had befallen the New Hampshire couple during this time period is pivotal in significance to this aspect of the UFO mystery. Under hypnotic regression Betty and Barney Hill told a story of being abducted, taken on board a UFO and examined. The validity of this interpretation on these events and the many others that followed is the subject of this part. What follows is of considerable relevance for under- standing and assessing the \"interrupted journey\" genre. John Fuller indicated: \"A dual identical psychosis (a folie a deux) is substantially excluded by the absence of other characteristics of this rare psychosis, nor was there any other evidence of psychosis. A joint fabrication is also substantially excluded. The two remaining possiblities would appear to be: (1) A totally real and true experience (2) An experience which had been so affected by the accompany- ing emotional state as to produce some perceptive and illusory misinterpretations — as embodied in the dream hypothesis.\" Dr. Benjamin Simon who carried out the Hill regressions stated: 22 \"I was ultimately left with the conclusion that the most tenable explanation that the series of dreams experienced by Mrs. Hill, as the aftermath of some type of experience with an Unidentified Flying Object or some similar phenomenon, assumed the quality of a fantasied experience. But the whole thing could not be settled in an absolute sense. The case could be safely left as it stood, especially in view of their improvement. We would remain in contact, and time might eventually bring out a more (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"(Australia, Continued) complete picture.\" Since the Hill case entered the public domain, numerous other cases of the \"interrupted journey\" and \"abduction\" genre have appeared. 23 Much of the alleged physical evidence indicated to be supportive of these accounts is hotly debated 24 . For example, the \"star map\" featured in the Hill story is seen from two extremes. Some see it as extraordinary evidence. Others deem it as largely spurious. In fact, even Jacques Vallee recently went on record to criticise the correlation of the \"star map\" with the Zeta Reticuli system. He somewhat unkindly referred to it as \"Zeta Ridiculous\" 25 . The controversy can be largely resolved into 3 camps: (1) The experiences are possibly objectively real. The strongest proponents of this hypothesis are the Lorenzens and their organization APRO. It is to their credit that they have gathered an extraordinary body of data and attempted to confirm the legitimacy of the accounts beyond hynotic regression with \"lie detector\" tests and psychological evaluations. Leo Sprinkle and James Harder have done most of the work in this area. 26 (2) The accounts are hoaxes or misinterpretations. The main proponents of this hypothesis are Phillip Klass and the late Dr. Donald Menzel. Their arguments, particularly those of the former, largely revolve around the \"weapon\" of character assasination 27 . (3) The experiences are largely of a psychological nature. This hypothesis received its strongest lift from the fascinating work of McCall and Lawson with \"imaginery abductees.\" In conjunction with other studies 28 this type of work has effectively provided an excellent calibration of \"regression\" information. The correspondence of \"imaginary\" and \"real\" abudction and \"interrupted journey\" type experiences are impressive and indeed the similarities with other types of \"journeys\" and experiences (\"out of the body experiences,\" \"pseudo death\" accounts, etc. 29 ) are food for thought. Psychological phenomena such as \"time-gap,\" hypnagogic and hypnapompic imagery 30 are now being offered as possible explanations. The work of Targ and Puthoff on brain hemisphere duality as an explanation of the extremes of information from \"standard\" to \"exotic\" in these types of situations is particularly illuminating 31 . The perspectives given by the wide-ranging arguments for and against the validity of these types of cases, requires the researcher to exercise considerable care in the retrieval of information. The researcher should — (a) approach these types of cases with an open mind and at first attempt to gain as much information as possible on that part of the experience which is extant in conscious recall. We could do no better to gain a good perspective of these types of cases by familiarising ourselves with the available literature. Fuller 32 , Lorenzen 33 and Fowler 34 are recommended for \"testing the water.\" (b) If a \"time loss\" is highlighted care should be undertaken in the way in which we approach it. Sprinkle 35 has provided an excellent starting point for those who are considering hypnosis and similar methods of \"memory\" retrieval. The quality of technique is of paramount importance here. An experienced practitioner, who should be qualified, accompanied by an experienced investigator well steeped in the shortcomings of the hypnotic regression technique and a qualified psychologist are desired. Interpretation of the information gained under such investigations should be cautious and well considered. (c) Harold Cahn of APRO has provided an interesting method of discriminating between \"true\" and \"false\" hypnotic regression cases, which involve monitoring the bodily direct current potential. He indicates that the DC potential curve correlates with trance induction. This will assist the investigator in assessing whether the subject is validly in a deep trance during a hypnotic session 36 . (d) These types of investigations should be supplemented with as much supportive information as possible. Sprinkle again indicates certain things that can be undertaken (\"lie-detection\" through polygraph testing and psychological assessment) 37 . The controversial use of psychological stress evaluation (PSE) has also been suggested as worth trying. It can be seen that while \"interrupted journey\" accounts may offer some opportunities of assessing the extremes of interactions with the UFO phenomenon, sorties by investigators into this \"murky field\" should be only undertaken if they are fully aware of the total picture. This area of information retrieval brings us into the domain of the human mind's ability to articulate interactions with apparent inexplicable manifestations. It is the experienced UFO researcher well-versed in this field who will be best able to evaluate the type of information gained through this type of information retrieval. Only time will tell whether it will give us more insights into the human mind or into the UFO phenomenon. Could it be that it will do both?

NEW VIEW OF PLEIADES By Richard Hall MUFON has received new information from reliable sources in Switzerland who have studied the Billy Meier photographs and other material (now in the book \"UFO...Contact From the Pleiades\") since 1976. When viewed in 1976, before publication, \"Some of the UFOs (photos) had a somewhat ragged edge, as if they had been cut out and superimposed upon the background. Several showed a UFO in front of a tree with Lake Pfaffikon in the background. Mr located the exact spot from which the photo was taken, but there was no tree. When confronted with this inexplicable fact Mr. Meier claimed that the tree had been dematerialized after the picture was taken!\" Other discrepancies noted by the Swiss investigators: One of the pictures allegedly shows the Horsehead Nebula in Orion as Meier flew past it in space; \"Since it has a diameter of several light years the absurdity of such a claim is obvious. Moreover, the picture coincides exactly, including the foreground stars, with terrestrial photos of that nebula.\" One of the out-pf-focus pictures used by Meier was traced to its original source, a drawing of the interior of a futuristic space station published in a magazine. Examined side by side, the two pictures were identical. The \"Talmud Immanuel,\" claimed by Meier to be the true New Testament hidden until recently, proved to be Luther's version of the New Testament with added passages exhibiting the same style as the Semjase manuscript (Meier's alleged space \"source\") and \"exactly the same stylistic errors characteristic of Mr. Meier's German.\" \"Mr. Meier's photo No. B 212 purports to show the passage way from one universe into another. Actually, it is a reproduction of a picture in the Smithsonian (magazine), Feb. 1976, p. 62-69.\" One of the investigators, a scientist, observes that, \"No contactee can refrain for long from making some remarks about topics in astronomy, cosmology, and astrophysics...in the assumption that one can discuss these subjects without any familiarity with science. Mr. Meier is no exception.\" Among the naive statements cited as examples were Meier's claim that the earth is 646 million years old and that the moon originated \"near the Milky Way.\" The report also notes that \"one of the most grotesque episodes\" involves Meier being transported back in time to meet Jesus, with Jesus playing the role of an admirer of Meier's intelligence and other outstanding qualities. \"Mr. Meier,\" it is concluded, \"evidently has a pathological need for recognition.\" 8"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"UFO ABDUCTION CASES: A MINI-SYMPOSIUM By Richard Hall Earlier this year a survey was conducted among a small group of professionals in medical, psychological, and behavioral science fields to determine current thinking about UFO witnesses who have reported being abducted by seemingly alien humanoid beings. The respondents, mostly members or consultants of the Mutual UFO Network or the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization, were: Richard F. Haines, PhD, Experimental Psychology/Physiology Barbara D. Peter, Assistant Professor of Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing Peter Rank, M.D., Medicine/ Radiology R. Leo Sprinkle, PhD, Psychology/ Counseling & Testing Ron Westrum, PhD, Sociology Grey Woodman, M.D., Psychiatry All believed that the reported experiences were at least partly \"real,\" in the sense of describing an actual shocking experience, but most thought that the witness might be unconsciously fabricating part of the story. They were asked to choose which of the following four hypotheses they felt was most applicable, or to suggest alternatives: (a) basically true experiences, in some cases emerging only under hypnosis because they are repressed due to shock (or deliberate memory blocks induced by the aliens) (b) some real shocking experience, perhaps an encounter with humanoid beings, but story/message content is unconscious fabrication, combining \"raw materials\" already existing in that person's mind, incomprehension, projected fears, etc., in an attempt to rationalize the experience. (c) wholly fantasy experiences, with content drawn basically from that person's personal or social awareness of UFO reports (d) conscious fabrications for one — or a mix — of motives such as money, notoriety, and attention- seeking All chose either hypnothesis (a) or (b). Two (Sprinkle and Woodman) chose (a) \"basically true experiences.\" Three (Haines, Rank, and Westrum) chose (b) some real experience combined with unconscious fabrication. Rank added that hypothesis (a) \"is attractive in a few instances.\" One (Peter) said \"(a) or (b) are possibilities.\" (Some alternative interpretations are quoted below). Question 2 proposed that transcripts of hypnotic regression sessions seemed to indicate occasional prompting of the subjects by the investigator or the hypnotist. They were asked to comment on this, and on the efficacy of hypnosis as an investigative tool in abduction cases. Most expressed severe cautions about the use of hypnosis, but felt it could be of value if properly applied. HAINES: Basically I agree that a great majority of past hypnotic regression reports involving people claiming UFO entity contact/abduction/etc, are so plagued by inept, poorly planned sessions and carried out by persons of highly questionable motives that they are almost worthless as reliable \"data.\" Their chief effect may only have been to greatly raise the noise level, making it that much harder to extract a real signal...if there is one. I believe that hypnosis is a very valuable tool when its practitioner is clinically trained and sensitive to its limitations. PETER: If an individual has repressed an experience because the conscious memory would be too painful, then hypnosis is an excellent way to relieve the power of repression. It is a respected modality in the field of psychiatry, if used as a fact-finding, not a prodding modality. The individual is highly suggestive and he might use suggestions from the hypnotist to fill in gaps from the memory of his experience that aren't necessarily true. RANK: It is well known that hypnotic subjects will fabricate stories in order to please the hypnotist, and this fact clouds hypnosis as a tool for the recovery of memory. On the other hand, it is also known that real events can be recalled under hypnosis with chilling and precise accuracy...(for example, by law enforcement agencies in criminal investigations)...! think hypnotic regression might continue to be used and the data interpreted very cautiously. SPRINKLE: I believe that hypnotic time regression procedures are useful in exploring the UFO abduction memories, or impressions. I doubt that the forthcoming information can be used as evidence to conclude that a physical abduction and examination occurred; however, the effects of hypnotherapeutic procedures can be evaluated in terms of the relief, acceptance, and certainty on the part of the abductee that the experience was \"real.\" The change in the lives of the abductees is a meaningful criterion, along with background investigation, psychiatric evaluation, polygraph examination, and interview procedures. WESTRUM: I think prompting witnesses in such cases is inexcusable unless it is absolutely necessary for their mental health in the minds of competent professionals. I much prefer cases like the Andreasson case where the hypnotist is not a UFOIogist. I know from Harder and Maack that the Kentucky case (January 1976) was completely ruined because of leading questions. (Editor's note: the Kentucky case had been cited in the question as an example of prompting primarily because Len Stringfield showed one of the witness' drawings of humanoids as reported by others before she had \"recalled\" seeing any such thing.) WOODMAN: I think hypnosis is a useful tool but the individual has to be evaluated as a total personality with attention paid to his pre-incident personality and experiences as well as the immediate post-incident functioning. Unfortunately people under hypnosis are very suggestible and thus it is a double-edged sword, and if a good story is expected by the hypnotist the subject may pick this up consciously or even telepathically and oblige. Question 3 asked whether the concept of \"folie a deux\" is relevant in shared abduction cases, and what evidence would tend to rule it out in a given case. (\"Folie a deux\" is a label given to psychotic symptoms or paranoid delusions shared by two or more persons who have close (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"(Abductions, Continued) emotional ties, typically a parent/child, two siblings, or husband/wife. The theory is that the dominant member of the pair induces the same symptoms in the relatively passive or submissive partner.) HAINES: Shared abduction experiences very probably evoke highly common sociocultural responses as are found in the same family. One possible \"test\" that this is not so would seem to call for independent verification of all the events involved.... PETER: To establish folie a deux, there is need for evidence of dependency before the incident and a need for evidence of dominance by one individual over another. One should also examine whether there is consistency in the story after the individuals are separated for any length of time. The absence of these factors would tend to rule out folie a deux as the cause. RANK: Folie a deux may certainly explain certain kinds of psychopathology in which two individuals develop their delusions around the UFO phenomenon. This is of course obviously true. It also points the way to a larger generalization, specifically that already established psychiatric and psychological mechanism will be observed in off individuals whether or not they have a close encounter or abduction experience. (Dr. Rank goes on to note that psychiatrists, in general, have no firm grasp of the UFO problem and will tend to come up with psychological mechanisms for the behavior and information obtained in psychiatric interviews, as well as in non-UFO situations where the precipitating event has been very real — Editor.) SPRINKLE: (Noting that he is not trained in psychiatry, Dr. Sprinkle observed only that) I have found no indication of folie a deux in my investigations of 5 pairs and 2 trios of abductees. WESTRUM: This certainly can occur in some cases, although in others (like the Minot, N.D. case — see The Edge of Reality, \"The Night an Occupant Was Shot\") it just doesn't seem to hold up. One must consider that a person who has a genuine amnesia and no repressed memory will try to fill the gap — and \"significant others\" may be very important in doing this. (See Podolsky in Bibliography.) WOODMAN: A folie a deux fantasy develops over a period of time — it is really an hysterical delusion, which evaporates when the two people concerned are separated over a period of a week or two. As one would expect, it is usually mother and daughter — in which the mother is psychotic (and stays psychotic) and the daughter has the induced delusion, which evaporates on separation. Question 4 mentioned the physical after-effects exhibited by abduction claimants (bum marks, skin lesions, weakness, headaches...) 10 characterizing them as \"stigmata.\"- How can these be evaluated, and what is the known range of parallel psychogenic effects? HAINES: I believe that \"stigmata\" are a phenomenon as old as mankind, indeed, modem man may have lost a good deal of his ability to self • generate such signs. Sometimes I think such physiological symptoms (clinically verified) lie along the same continuum as our unconscious, i.e., that they may simply reflect another form of human communication from being to being. If it is true that we have only the ability to communicate verbally about SO to 75% of our total communication ability I ask, what are the other forms? And why are there others? A silent physiognomy change (e.g., stigmata) might well serve this purpose. And, if UFO entities exist and try to communicate with us, perhaps they are merely using an age-old means...which we have long since forgotten or, more properly, voluntarily let go of in favor of rapid verbal patterns. PETER: The influence of the mind over the physical body is limitless. Diagnosis of the organ — and emotional diagnosis — are needed to determine the psycho-physiological pathology. RANK: All of the physical after-effects about which I have read can either be self induced, faked, or psychologically induced in a very profound way, such as \"stigmata.\" Therefore, none of these alleged physical after-effects is conclusive. SPRINKLE: I am not trained in medical procedures; my only comment is that UFO investigators can record these claims; encourage participants to seek medical attention; encourage some medical practitioners to become UFO investigators! WESTRUM: Some of this may be the result of injuries, etc., suffered during the amnesic period; some of it may be due to hysterical symptoms, which can be quite impressive. All of it could be explained by ordinary medical principles, but the content of the memories from case to case is remarkably similar. On the other hand, considering the enormous fear which the memories seem to generate, their origin may be psychogenic, but related to the original stimulus — i.e., encounter with something scary. As for \"burn marks,\" I don't think these could be psychogenic. WOODMAN: Presumably these are the somatic equivalent of anxiety, although some may actually be the result of some force field applied to the individual — bum marks and skin lesions may be examples of the latter. It would be fascinating to administer psychological test instruments (projective) if any such abductee had previously been evaluated by such. Question 5 asked for \"the most essential and basic methods that should be applied for proper analysis of abduction reports.\" There was considerable overlap in the responses, so the following is a generalized list of recommendations. Guidelines 1. Isolate, protect, and emotionally support the subject (S). Determine his or her mood and outlook. 2. Try to involve professionally trained psychologists or psychiatrists early in the investigation. 3. Carefully plan a systematic and gentle probing into the alleged experience. 4. Establish the basic facts of the story as soon as possible without inducing strain on S. Have S write down or tape record all conscious memories prior to hypnosis. 5. With professional help, investigate and record both the physical and emotional history of S before and after the incident. 6. Note secondary \"gains\" or benefits accruing to S as a result of telling the story, or not. 7. Determine S's interpretation of the meaning of the event. 8. Keep careful records of all communications to and from S. 9. suggested investigative tools: a. Objective hypnosis avoiding leading or suggestive questions b. psychiatric evaluation and/or psychotherapy c. polygraph d. EEG and general neurological examination e. psychological stress evaluation (PSE) f. biofeedback using autonomic nervous system reponses to evaluate S's progress in self- awareness Other Ways of Looking At It The question requesting alternative explanations for abduction reports elicited some interesting answers, and insights: HAINES: (Not having been personnally abducted and lacking an adequate pseudo-materialistic explanation) I am largely left with my own search for an intuitive grasp of what may cause this highly"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"personal experience which is known as the \"UFO abduction.\" It stiQ seems beyond our reason. While I do not want to accept the fantastic stories by others I have no a priori reason for not accepting at least some of them. We 0) must maintain as strategically flexible a position as possible..thus my current choice of hypothesis(b). PETER: Reports of abduction can follow a traumatic experience or can be a product of the individual's break from reality in which he/she describes being controlled by other people (a characteristic of psychosis) — symbolic of the individual's lack of control. But why the individual uses the UFO experience is an unknown. RANK: The essence of most abduction experiences is identical, even if the abductee's interpretation is in some ways very personal. There is no sensible reason to assume that most people...have fabricated this information because, in a psychological sense, there is no substantial secondary gain. Indeed, in many instances there is distinct loss of real assets to individuals after they reported such an encounter. v SPRINKLE: (Although I favor the \"basically true experiences\" hypothesis) I recognize the possibility that some abduction reports may be due to other conditions, e.g., \"shocking experiences,\" \"fantasy experiences,\" and \"conscious fabrications.\" However, in my work with approximately 50 persons, using hypnotic time regression procedures, I have found no indication of hoax, lie, fantasy production, neurotic or psychotic reaction, etc., or other \"known\" condition, which might account for aO aspects of the abduction experiences. WESTRUM: My alternative — In most abduction cases, we know only two things: that there was an amnesic period under hypnosis, associated with a UFO sighting and that there are memories which can be elicited in relation to this amnesic period under hypnosis. In some other cases there are in addition feelings of fear or physical symptoms. Two things must be explained: (1) where did the amnesia, often for a whole carload of people, originate and (2) where did the content of the memories come from? I think part of the answer to (2) rests with the witness and his/her social environment. I think it is quite possible, however, that there is a core of events which might be due to alien intelligences; these same intelligences might also explain the amnesia. It is the amnesia, however, which is the most difficult to explain, since the witness can continue driving the car or whatever. Nothing advanced so far to explain this amnesia is convincing to me. What we really need to do is investigate cases like the Minot, N.D., case more thoroughly — where you have four unrelated adults, who all become amnesic at the same time and who (apparently) have similar memory contents regarding the incident. (See Hynek & Vallee, 1975, in Bibliography, chapter 5.) Question 6 asked for references in the psychological/psychiatric literature that would be helpful to abduction case investigators. The responses are compiled here into a Bibliography which, with the guidelines, provides useful research material. BIBLIOGRAPHY Some Books and Articles Reporting UFO Abduction Cases Barry, Bill.

The pages of the Journal are open for further discussion. Two questions occurred to me: (1) Couldn't sodium pentothal (\"truth serum\") be usefully applied — perhaps more reliably than hypnosis — in seeking the truth of an abduction story? Nitrous oxide? (2) Is there a significant — perhaps crucial — difference in the methodology of hypnosis as commonly practiced by therapists, as opposed to criminal investigators? Therapists are trying to help then- patients cope with personally disturbing problems. Perhaps prompting the patient might even be desirable in certain circumstances, wherein the ultimate \"truth\" of some experience is not the central issue. In UFO applications, the desirable style of hypnosis may be more akin to that practiced in criminal investigations in which the central purpose is to obtain more accurate detail from repressed factual information. Could it be that hypnotherapists are (quite naturally) more oriented toward \"helping\" than \"truth-seeking?\" If so, this would be an important consideration. Note that Dr. Benjamin Simon (Hill case hypnotherapist) stresses the words \"patients\" and \"therapeutic 12 THE NIGHT THE STARS CHANGED PLACES (Remembrances of L.R. Lindblad as recorded by his daughter, Norma) The world is so different from what it was when I was bom July 21,1903, in Texarkana, Arkansas. Growing up in a border town in a rural area during that time was hard work and a lot of fun. We made our fun. Hunting and fishing took up a lot of time. Tracking, catching, and caring for a variety of wild animals provided us boys with excitement and kept us out of doors. A good wolf or fox hunt could easily last three or four days. As the years went by our greatest pleasure continued to be to lay out on a hill under the stars talking and listening to the dogs trail. In the early fall about the year 1936 the circus came to town. Our wives and children were pleasantly occupied so six of us slipped away for a good fox hunt. It was a clear chilly night and the sky looked full of stars. They looked large like the evening star — bright, and close. We were about 12 miles west of the city in Bowie County, Texas, and it was getting on towards midnight when we settled down to listen to the music of the chase. Suddenly we noticed something we had never seen before. In a huge circle just above our heads the stars were changing place. One star would dart over across the sky and stop suddenly. Then another would go another direction and stop. We watched this for 30 or 40 minutes and it looked like all the stars in the circle changed places one at a time. Then suddenly it was over. Nowadays people spend their time indoors looking at TV and talking about weird things like Bigfoot, people from outer space, and UFOs. I just can't believe in things like that. I would have to see one before I would believe it. procedure\" while observing that hypnosis only provides a pathway to the patient's subjective truth. It seems crystal clear from his statements that the central issue to him was \"helping,\" not \"truth-seeking.\" How important is this distinction in the outcome of hypnosis applied to abduction cases? BOOK REVIEW Strangers Among Us, by Ruth Montgomery (New York: Coward, McCann & Geoghegan, 1979), $9.95 UFO information from psychic sources may or may not be your saucer of tea. If it is, you'll certainly want to read Chapter 10 entitled \"Extrater- restrials\" in this intriguing book. And even if it's not, the chapter is introduced with a well-reported and previously unpublished CE I observed in 1951 by Richard and Helen Byrd of a prominent Virginia family. By automatic typing, her guides told this popular prognosticator that the UFO was real, and not of Planet Earth. From other areas of the galaxy they travel by means of vibratory energies beyond our present comprehension, and are re-assembled in the earth's atmosphere. The sentient beings who operate these vehicles on scientific missions are in a totally different stage of advancement, we learn. Although they intend no harm, UFOs are sometimes lethal in their activities when too near to humans. The Air Force is aware of these visitors, stated the guides, and is \"less than open in its reports.\" While a few extraterrestrials have occupied earth bodies for a widening of understanding, they are not bent on conquest. During the next two decades, the earth will be studied by increasing numbers of UFOs, we are told. It lies within the powers of man to prevent World War III, but not a cataclysmic shift in the earth's axis of rotation which is to occur around the turn of the century. This last prophecy runs like a thread throughout the book. How accurate is Ruth Mont- gomery's information? Time will tell, but we don't have to wait for the apocalypse. Should the 1980 presidential election turn out in the surprising manner her sources predict, perhaps we should give them some serious consideration indeed. Meanwhile, Strangers Among Us will be intriguing, thought-provoking, and no doubt best-selling.— David L.

Moravec (Presented at UFOCON 4, Artarmon, Sydney, N.S.W., Australia, October 14, 1979. ©1979 by Mark L. Moravec.) \"...in Ufology the rule is to think of everything and to believe nothing.\" — Aime Michel, 1969. Over recent years, many UFO researchers have increasingly focused their attention on what I term \"psiufological\" phenomena: those cases where UFO and paranormal events apparently overlap. Some claim that this type of case holds the key to unlock the UFO mystery. Others claim that such cases are unreliable and distract us from proving the physical reality of UFOs. The only way to determine what viewpoint is correct is by thoroughly investigating and researching reports of psiufological events. The aim of this paper is to present an overview of psiufological phenomena, hypotheses thay may explain such events, and some implications for investigation. Psiufological phenomena can be split up into a number of categories: 1. MENTAL COMMUNI- CATIONS. In these cases, a person claims to have received mental communications from a source that is usually identified as a UFO entity. The communication may be received before, during, or after a UFO encounter and through a variety of modes including apparent telepathy, automatic writing, trance-states, or visions. In the simplest case, a witness may report that \"something\" made him look up, and there above him was a UFO. A number of hypotheses may explain this reaction: (1) It is just a coincidence that the witness happened to look up at the time the UFO was present. (2) The witness's own, natural ESP made him aware of the UFO's presence. (3) The UFO intelligence deliberately made its presence known to the witness by means of a telepathically- transmitted signal. In more complex cases, the witness may receive a communication predicting future events or a communication consisting of heavy, philosophical cum spiritual concepts. An example of mental communication in the UFO context is the Frankston, Victoria, case of 25 July, 1972. Mrs. M. Puddy observed a blue, disc-shaped object while driving along the Mooraduc Road. She lost control of her car which slowed to a halt by itself. She became aware of an inaudible \"voice\" in her mind which said: \"All your tests will be negative. Tell the media we mean no harm. You now have control.\" The witness experienced apparitions of alleged UFO entities in the following year (Basterfield, 1977: Magee, 1972). In this type of case, the \"communication\" may be explicable as: (1) An unconscious fantasy incorporating previous knowledge of UFO cases (cf, hypnotic regression cases). (2) A \"symptom\" of psycho- pathological behaviour (cf, paranoid schizophrenia) triggered by a personal crisis unrelated to the UFO experience. (3) A \"symptom\" of psycho- pathological behaviour triggered by a traumatic UFO experience. (4) A telepathic communication to the witness from the UFO intelligence. Hypotheses (1) and (2) may be less likely if it can be shown that objective, physical UFO events have occurred. Our present level of knowledge may be inadequate to enable us to differentiate between hypotheses (3) and (4). However, perhaps the content of the communication may give us a lead. 2. POLTERGEISTS. Poltergeists (literally \"noisy spirits\") usually involve the unexplained movements of objects. Most parapsychologists hold the view that poltergeists center around a person who unconsciously uses his powers of psychokinesis (mind over matter) to take out his frustrations on the physical environment. Poltergeists may interact with UFOs in several ways. A UFO witness may have had a history of poltergeist disturbances prior to his UFO sighting, or he may find that his residence is suddenly \"invaded\" by a poltergeist subsequent to his UFO experience. At the flap level, UFOs and poltergeists may be witnessed in the same geographical area over a short time-span. UFO cases involving the \"levitation\" of the witness or his vehicle could conceivably also involve poltergeist effects. An example of an apparent UFO-poltergeist interaction is the Wooler, Ontario, Canada, case of 2 July, 1968. Fred and Wayne Coulthard observed an object with rotating red lights which agitated the family's horses and cats. Less than 2 hours later, poltergeist disturbances began in the house and continued for several days. A window shattered; cards, spoons, and a glass were thrown around; and a strong odor of roses was detected in the kitchen (Greystone, 1969). Assuming hoaxes have been ruled out, the following hypotheses might explain the UFO-poltergeist type of (Continued on next page) 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"(Paranormal, Continued) (1) At the flap level, if the mass media are giving wide coverage of one unusual phenomenon (UFOs), they will also tend to report other unusual phenomena (poltergeists), thus, creating a spurious correlation. (2) The close encounter UFO experience triggers or amplifies psi abilities such as psychokinesis which is manifested unconsciously as a poltergeist. (3) Both poltergeists and UFOs are temporary, physical manifestations unconsciously produced by paranormal means by the central witness. (4) Both UFOs and poltergeists are manifestations of an intelligence external to man. (5) A witness with poltergeist disturbances is psychic and psychic people are more likely to see a UFO existing beyond the normal sensory range. Hypothesis (3) implies an internal, person-centered cause; hypothesis (4) implies an external cause; and hypotheses (2) and (5) imply an inter- action between internal and external causes. Since poltergeists involve objective, physical events, UFO- poltergeist cases are potentially of high evidential value. 3. APPARITIONS. Apparitions are hallucinatory experiences of the visual kind involving the human figure. Apparitions gain significance when they exhibit correspondences with external events or with the experiences of other percipients. Most parapsychologists believe that apparitions are communications received via ESP which become conscious through a hallucinated experience. Apparitions and UFOs may interact in much the similar way as poltergeists and UFOs, except that in apparition cases we are apparently dealing with subjective experiences. The UFO witness may have seen apparitions prior, during, or after his UFO experience. UFOs and apparitions may also be seen in the same locality. An example of a possible 14 UFO-apparition interaction is the March 1975 events at a highland farm in Tasmania. A man observed two soundless, flashing lights, beneath which was a yellow glow dimly illuminating the ground. The lights speeded upwards at a steep angle. In the same month, two shooters observed an apparition on the same farm. One described it as a woman in the dress of the last century and which glided up steps; the other described it as an area of oval light which pulsed until it faded away to nothing. There were other sightings of apparitions and nocturnal lights at the same locale (TUFOIC, 1977). Possible explanations for UFO- apparition cases are: (1) At the flap level, a spurious media correlation. (2) Hypnopompic (intermediate state between sleep and wakefulness) or hypnagogic (between wakefulness and sleep) imagery. (3) A \"symptom\" of psycho- pathological behaviour triggered either by a personal crisis or a traumatic UFO experience. (4) A telepathic communication manifesting as a visual hallucination) from the UFO intelligence. (5) Amplification of psi abilities (manifesting visually) by a UFO experience. (6) A witness of apparitions is psychic and psychic people are more likely to see a UFO existing beyond the normal sensory range. 4. PARANORMAL HEALINGS. In some cases, paranormal healings appear to be directly associated with UFOs. An example is the case of Dr. \"X\" which began on 2 November, 1968, in southeastern France. Dr. \"X\", a biologist, observed the approach of two red and silver, luminescent, disc- shaped objects. The two objects merged into one, and shone a white spotlight on the witness. The object then \"dematerialized\" with a \"bang.\" Afterwards, the witness realized that both a painful, three-day-old axe wound (from chopping wood) and a 10-year- old Algerian War wound had completely healed. The witness also experienced premonitions, mental communications, and poltergeist disturbances subsequent to his sighting (Michel, 1969). There appear to be three main alternatives to explain UFO-associated healings: (1) In some cases, the complaint itself was psychosomatic and was \"cured\" by suggestion after the UFO event. (2) Healings of short-term wounds may have been speeded up by electromagnetic radiation from the UFO. (3) A paranormal healing was carried out by the UFO intelligence. 5. GHOSTLIGHTS. \"Ghostlights\" are small lights which usually occur close to ground level and tend to reappear in the same location. I have included ghostlights as a type of psiufologjcal phenomenon since they appear to fit both the classifications of a UFO (unidentified, airborne light) and a haunting (recurrent, localized manifestation). Australia's most famous ghostlight is undoubtedly the Min-Min Light which reportedly frequents the Boulia district of western Queensland. It has been described as a glary, green ball of light which moves 5-10 feet above the ground at an estimated 10 mph (Lamond, 1937; Cusack, 1975). Ghostlights may be: (1) Misidentiftcations of natural phenomena such as wind- blown mists; phosphorescence in marshes; perceptual alterations in a non-illuminated visual field (\"cerebral grey\"); clusters of luminescent insects; light refraction effects; ball lightning or other electrical discharge. (2) Psychokinetic or poltergeist effects unconsciously produced by an individual. (3) Non-physical apparitions/ ghosts. (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"(4) Small, physical UFOs (\"remote-control probes\"). Implications for Investigation I have looked at five categories of psiufological phenomena and hypotheses which may explain such cases. Some of these relatively bizarre cases may emanate from psychological- ly disturbed people, so it is certainly desirable to have the participation of specialists in psychology and psychiatry where possible. Some case studies may also be aided by the application of hypnotic regression techniques by competent hypno- therapists. Meaningful research requires an adequate base of thoroughly investigated and documented psiufological cases. The properly- equipped investigator needs to know how to investigate paranormal experiences as well as \"down-to-earth\" UFO events. To this end, I have designed a detailed questionnaire to supplement the standard UFO report form. The questionnaire for UFO/ Paranormal cases covers the paranormal phenomena dealt with in this paper as well as general psychological and physiological reactions and witness background. Recommended guides to investigating paranormal events are SPR (1968) and Green (1976). Probably the most important factors which the investigator of psiufological cases needs to pay attention to, are: 1. The witness's prior knowledge of UFO and paranormal phenomena. This is a critical factor in determining hoaxes, the influence of overactive imaginations or potential raw material for hallucinations. 2. The witness's previous and subsequent paranormal experiences, if any. This is an important factor in evaluating the apparent connections between UFOs and paranormal events. 3. Whether or not any objective, physical manifestations have taken place. If objective, physical events have taken place, we can be reasonably certain that the reported experiences are not solely psychopathological or hallucinatory in origin. Finally, I would be interested in hearing about any psiufological cases that other investigators come across, for possible inclusion in a projected Australian catalogue of such cases.

Many years ago while residing in an apartment in Washington, D.C., I was taking a nap during a Sunday afternoon. As I started to wake up I perceived — or thought I did — small animated figures not unlike the popular conception of fairies dancing on the wall adjacent to my bed. I was quite startled, and my heart beat fast as I \"popped\" awake to investigate. Within a few seconds I was able to discover the stimulus, and the real (i.e., correct) interpretation of what I was perceiving: dancing spots of sunlight filtered through tree branches outside my window. Perhaps not enough has been said about the tendency for the human mind to try to organize stimuli of unknown origin into familiar or recognizable patterns, especially when in a soporific state. Exactly why I \"chose\" miniature humanoid forms is unclear to me, but I did. — Richard Hall. HENRY CO. LOCAL, New Cutl«, R - March 20, 1980 U.F.O/s Sighted In New Castle Mrs. Anna Ricketts, New Castle. reported to the Local Monday that on Sunday. March 9, at about 9 p.m., she was 'disturbed by barking dogs and when she looked out the back of her house she saw in her yard, about fifty feet from the house, a strange, very bright object hovering motionless about twenty feet from the ground. Because of the brightness of the object, the best she could tell of the shape was that it looked like a piper cub without wings. Protruding from the bottom of the craft were at least three antenna-looking slicks, slight- ly at an angle, pointing toward the ground. At one time, Mrs. Rickelts went into the backyard to get a closer look. She awakened her husband. Wilson, who accompanied her to the back porch, but by then the object had moved in a northwesterly direc- tion toward Sulphur Road, shooting straight up, then down, and at irregular angles, before disappear- ing from sight. At no time did they see this object touch the ground. While still on the porch, waiting to see what would happen next. another object, which could have been sitting on the ground or close la it toward Sulphur Road, was sighted. This object appeared, to be much smaller and had various colored lights showing. Mrs. Ricketts called the State Police but the objects were gone by the time an officer arrived. She has been reluctant to mention this phenomenon before now.

The witnesses, Miroslaw Goralski and Krzysztof Kobus of Sztum, Poland, contacted Ms. Popik on September 21, aware of some articles she had written about UFOs. She put them in two separate rooms and interrogated them separately. On the previous day Goralski had asked his friend Kobus to help him spade his garden, and they finished about 9:00 p.m. Goralski went to a water tap to rinse off the shovels and Kobus had entered the summer house and lit a cigarette. Goralski suddenly spotted a silver delta-shaped thing that seemed about to crash and explode, so he yelled to his friend and dropped to the ground, covering his head with a shovel. Kobus heard the yell and came out to see what was happening. Above the flower bed within the fenced garden plot he saw a \"ring\" with thick white \"flames\" around it, like a dense light, except that the sky and clouds were visible through it. Goralski was lying on the ground. The ring was slpwly descending. Goralski, looking from a different angle, saw it as an object like \"two silver deltas connected by a cross.\" Both men experienced a squeaking or \"high frequency\" sound in their heads; Goralski termed the sound \"unbearable.\" Together, they walked closer to investigate. They suddenly found themselves engulfed by a dense, white \"fog\" and illuminated by bright light. Goralski had been carrying a 16 Emilia Popik is an editor in Gdansk, Poland. Her interests include Biblical exegesis, myths, and parapsychology shovel, but now he noticed that it was gone. They described their next impressions separately. Kobus: Feeling \"totally petrified,\" he propped himself against one of three prism-like objects; it was soft and comfortable like an armchair, he noticed that Goralski's face was distorted and his knees bent, as if he were experiencing gravity effects. Goralski: Feeling euphoric rather than frightened, he felt a force pressing on him and briefly had the impression of an elevator going up at high speed. Then it stopped. He began asking questions of what he supposed were unseen entities, but there was no answer. Each time the sound ceased for a moment. When he asked what they knew about integrated circuits or transistors, there was an answer: \"Nothing.\" \"What is matter?,\" he persisted. An answer came: \"The most important attribute of matter is its ability to pervade through other matter.\" Kobus: Still seated in the \"armchair,\" he saw a flood of colors — red, black, blue, yellow — then after changing to gray the display stopped. His head was like a computer; thoughts and ideas were flowing into his brain as if from an external source. He saw Goralski turn and lean out of the \"fog\" at a steep angle, as if leaning out a window watching something. When he looked down at his \"armchair\" again, it was gone. He was sitting on nothing, but he did not fall. He, too, began asking questions and experienced a visual display like a time channel, with people in costumes of bygone days. Goralski: When he leaned over he found himself looking down on his town, with a clear view of familiar lakes, the main street and lights along it. Then he was abruptly deposited back in his garden, falling or jumping from a height of about 30 cm. Kobus felt as if a chair had been pulled out from under him and he fell on his bottom and rolled onto his back in the garden. Nothing looked different in the garden. The summer house was open, and the missing shovel was lying on the ground. Goralski ran home, arriving about 9:30 p.m., and searched for the key to the garden gate and cottage; it it were there, it would mean the events were unreal. But the key was still in the cottage door back in the garden. The two men, perplexed, stayed at the cottage talking until early the following morning. When they tried to tell their friends what had happened, they were laughed at. So they decided to contact Ms. Popik. After thorough interrogation, Ms. Popik arranged for psychological testing at the local university on March 1 and 2. Only Kobus showed up, and he underwent several hours of tests by an eminent psychologist who devised special tests for the occasion. A final report is pending. Earlier, soon after the event, both men had taken standard psychological tests, which revealed normal personalities with no inclination to lie.D"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"A FAINT ECHO OF THE TRUTH By Lucius Farish James E. Obcrg's paper, \"Quality Control of the UFO Data Base: Some Suggested Techniques,\" in the 1980 MUFON UFO SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS, refers (p. 125) to what is called \"a typical UFO report involving •' the Echo satellite.\" The sighting, by yours truly and another witness (\"B.M.\"), occurred on the evening of May 20, 1965. A sighting report was submitted to both NICAP and APRO at the time. By omitting pertinent details of the observation, Oberg \"concludes\" that the object was actually Echo n in its #6380 orbit. He states that the figures for this particular orbit \"fit the UFO position and direction quite nicely.\" I find it significant that he does not mention the time of the sighting in his attempt to pass off the report as just one more erroneous observation which was thought to be a UFO. As I stated in my initial report, I had observed the Echo II satellite (as well as numerous others) on several occasions and was > thoroughly familiar with its appearance. The object which \"B.M.\" and I saw some 15 years ago, was decidedly not Echo D or any other man- made satellite, whatever else it may have been. The object definitely stopped its movement entirely at one point while I was observing it (easily determined by observing the star field through which it was passing) and, according 'to \"B.M.\", it had halted at intervals during the time he watched it (approximately 10 minutes) before he arrived at my home to tell me about the object. Agreed, the sighting is not a spectacular one, by any means, and probably does not deserve the space devoted to it by either Oberg or myself. It is, at best, merely one more \"nocturnal light\" report.

Fawcett MUFON of North Carolina held its fourth annual training conference in Winston Salem on Saturday, June 21 and Sunday, June 22,1980. This year's conference, hosted again by officers and members of the Tar Heel UFO Study Group of Winston Salem, was chaired by Mrs. Gayle C. McBride, assistant MUFON-NC state director from Germanton. All four major UFO groups in U.S.A. were represented: Dr. Willy Smith a physicist from CUFOS in Norcross, Georgia; W.E. Bing Garthright, head of an analytical studies group from NICAP in Washington, D.C.; Thomas P. Deuley, an APRO and MUFON investigator from Ft. Meade, Maryland; and Henry H. McKay, a MUFON provincial director from Ontario, Canada. Other out of state UFO representatives came from Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Georgia. Over 60 investigators, researchers, members and guests of MUFON-NC were present from 20 towns and cities in North Carolina. Henry H. Morton of Wadesboro served as Master-of-Ceremonies. The speakers and subjects included — Joseph N. Eubanks, a MUFON Field Investigator and State Section Director, on \"The First Alleged Abduction in North Carolina\", an abduction of a housewife in rural Raleigh, N.C. that occurred on April 24, 1979. \"Diamagnetism,\" a theory to explain the propulsion systems of UFOs, presented by Henry H. Morton, an electronic researcher and a MUFON Field Investigator from Wadesboro. Morton described how his theory of diamagnetism would explain the maneuvers, electro-magnetic frequencies, lights, sounds, odors, and radiation residue and effects found in UFO encounters. 18 Wayne Laporte, a facilities industrial engineer and MUFON State Section Director, gave a slide presentation titled \"UFO Occupants\", which covered the appearance of various occupants and their interaction with UFO witnesses worldwide, many of whom have become \"silent contactees\" over the years. George D. Fawcett, MUFON-NC State Director, gave a report on \"Human Re-Actions to UFOs\" based on a two-year study of such reactions from UFO eyewitnesses in over 30 countries and all 50 states. The re- actions ranged from serenity and calm to fear and blind panic and from personality changes to deaths attributed to various UFO encounters, etc. Jim Ingle, a chief criminal prosecutor and deputy sheriff of the Lincoln County Sheriff Department, recounted his \"CE III Experience\" that occurred in 1957, when he served with the U.S. Air Force at Georges Air Sculpted head of humanoid by Gayle McBride fphoto: Dennis Beck) Force Base near Victorville, California. At 9 p.m. a circular UFO with windows dropped down from the sky at a rapid speed and then hovered near his mobile home. Ingle noted a silhouetted bust of a \"small occupant\" looking down at him through one of the windows. The UFO during the encounter cast \"a circle of bluish light\" on the ground around the witness, before it lifted up and moved away at a rapid speed. Ingle was badly frightened by his experience. Wayne LaPorte, another slide presentation, \"Anatomy of a UFO Window-the Seismic Connection.\" Don Roberts, a MUFON Field Investigator from Columbia, South Carolina, a report titled \"Retrievals of the Third Kind\", which covered the recovery of crashed UFOs and their dead humanoid occupants. Roberts also covered some of the recent CIA- UFO links uncovered by members of the Ground Saucer Watch in Phoenix, Arizona, through their recent Freedom of Information lawsuit against the CIA. Dan J. Duke, a MUFON Contributing Subscriber and a Psychology Professor at Appalachian State University in Boone, a presentation on \"Psychology of Human Testimony Under Hypnosis\". Duke pointed out that hypnotically aided recall may produce either accurate memories or at times may facilitate the creation of pseudo memories or fantasies that are accepted as real by UFO witnesses and the hypnotist alike. He emphasized that there is no known way of distinguishing with certainty between actual recall and pseudo memories except by independent verification. Duke told how \"demand characteristics\" and \"authorative figures\" play both a conscious and unconscious role in UFO investigations under hypnosis and must be guarded against.

According to Sprinkle, abductees often believe they have been given a mission by the UFO occupants. A Soviet scientist's report on UFOs is detailed in the July 15 issue of THE STAR. Radio astronomer L.M. Gindilis, in a study prepared for the Soviet Academy of Sciences, suggests that the unexplained UFO sightings represent \"spacecraft entering our system from universes beyond.\" A copy of the Soviet report was leaked to Stanton Friedman and has been published by the Center for UFO Studies. James Oberg's \"UFO Update\" column in the July issue of OMNI is largely devoted to \"sensational claims\" about UFOs which have originated with various Soviet researchers and which have been publicized in this country by the NATIONAL ENQUIRER. Oberg also mentions the research of Dr. Richard F. Haines on visual perception, as it applies to UFO reports. The August issue of FATE has an interesting article by Richard Toronto on his efforts to reproduce the \"skycreatures\" photos which have been the focal point of Trevor James Constable's three books on \"living UFOs.\" The infra-red photos taken by Toronto, Constable and others are extremely intersting and certainly appear to show somefhing of an unexplained nature in the sky.

Snyder includes material on humanoid reports, abductions, CIA involvement with UFOs, the alleged sightings by astronauts, the scientific approach to UFO investigation, and other \"standard\" topics.

Dimitri Ossipov, a MUFON translator living in Bellerose) N.Y., recently attended \"The 1980 National UFO Conference\" in New York City sponsored by James W. Moseley. He had this brief evaluation of the speakers: Rick Hilberg \"History of UFOs\" (with slides) was clear and to the point. The lecture by John Keel was lacking in depth, since he touched on so many subjects in a limited time. The debate between Stanton Friedman and Bob Sheaffer was lively and interesting. Stan was very articulate and convincing, whereas Sheaffer was simply repeating the old Phil Klass refrain, without adding anything new. Betty Hill displayed slides of recent UFOs taken by her in New Hampshire. With all due respect to Mrs. Hill, her slides were not convincing. They could have been anything from Times Square by night to lightning or fireworks. When Betty related her personal abduction case, Mr. Ossipov found this very interesting and it sounded authentic. Stan Friedman advised that there were about 300 people in attendance. Dimitri, as a MUFON translator, would like to become of greater service in utilizing his linguistic talent in the following languages: French, German, Yugoslav or Serbo-Croation, Russian and Spanish.
