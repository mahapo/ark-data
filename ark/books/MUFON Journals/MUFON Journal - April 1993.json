By Raymond E. Fowler MUFON Director of Investigations Charlie Foltz can see his three naked friends waiting on a bench. Drawing by C. Foltz. O n Friday night, August 20, 1976, four young art students in their early twenties left Boston, Massachusetts for a canoe and camping trip in a wilderness area of Northern Maine along the Allagash River. The group consisted of identical twins, Jack and Jim Weiner, Charlie Foltz and Chuck Rak. Upon arrival at a staging point, they hired a pontoon airplane which flew them and their canoes to TeTos Lake on the Allagash Waterway. During the next several days they canoed and camped along the Waterway. On the evening of Thursday, August 26, they reached Eagle Lake, set up camp and decided to go night fishing for trout. The pitch darkness of the area necessitated the building of a huge bonfire to mark their campsite so that they could find their way back to it. Shortly after be- ginning to fish, Chuck became aware of a feeling of be- ing watched. He told us that: \"I turned toward the direction from where I felt this and saw a large bright sphere of colored light hovering motionless and soundless about 200-300 feet above the southeastern rim of the cove.\" Chuck yelled for the others to look behind them. There, rising above the trees was a huge oval glowing object. As their eyes became adapted to its intense brightness, a gyroscopic motion was noted, as if there were pathways : of energy flowing equatorially and longitudinally from pole to pole. This divided the sphere into four oscillating quadrants of bright colored light. The color changes were very liquid and envelop- ing, as if the entire object had a plasmatic motion to it, like a thick sauce does as it starts a rolling boil. Charlie grabbed a flashlight and blinked it at the ob- ject. Instantly, the huge rising glowing object came to an abrupt halt and began to slowly approach the canoe. Simultaneously, a tube-shaped beam of light erupted from the object and hit the water. A glowing ring with a dark center reflected on the water's surface, indicating that the beam was hollow. The object and its beam of light began moving toward the canoe. Terrified, the APRIL 1993 NUMBER 300 PAGE 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL The tube-like light seemed to hold the ca- noe steady as each man was put back In his original seating position. campers began paddling frantically toward their bonfire and camp as the beam swept across the lake directly at them and engulfed them. It was from this point on that the conscious memories of the four differed according to each witness' vantage point. The next thing Charlie remembered was pad- dling for shore and standing at the campsite with the others, watching the object move away. Chuck Rak remembers staying in the canoe after the others had piled out in panic onto the shore. Transfixed, still holding his idle paddle, he could not take his eyes off the object. Jack and Jim were able to consciously remember a bit more. Jack said that \"It was just behind us and I could see that we were never going to outrun the Beam. It was advancing too fast and I remember thinking, 'Holy shit! This is it! We'll never get away.' The next thing I knew, we were on the shore getting out of the canoe looking di- rectly at the object which was now about 20 or 30 feet above the water. The beam was coming out of the bot- tom of it like the object was sitting on the beam. It hov- ered there, right in front of us, completely silent for what seemed like four or five minutes. \"Suddenly the beam was pointing up towards the sky. The object began to move up and away from us to- wards the southwestern sky and then shot into the stars and was gone in just a second.\" Jim Weiner said that \"There was no mistake that it was coming directly to us. Then I remember standing on the lakeshore watching the object hovering above the lake 50 to 75 yards in front of us ... Then the search beam went upward into the sky and we saw it moving away at a tremendous speed. \"We all seemed to be in a state of shock . . . We just stood there unable to move or talk.\" W hen the strange anesthetizing effect wore off, Chuck got out of the canoe and joined the others as they trudged dreamily up the beach to their camp. Even in this state, they were dumbfounded when they re- alized what had happened to the huge bonfire that had just been blazing several minutes ago. \"When we left to go fishing,\" said Jim, \"we set very large logs on the fire to burn for a good 2 to 3 hours. The entire experience seemed to last, at the most, 15 or 20 minutes. Yet the fire was completely burned down to red coals.\" At that time, they had no memory of what happened during the time it took for their huge bonfire to burn down. This would remain a puzzle to them for years. A few years later, Jim suffered a head injury which caused tempero-limbic epilepsy. During treatment, Jim's doctors asked him to report any unusual experiences that might be symptomatic of his condition. Jim de- scribed strange experiences that he and his friends had experienced since the UFO encounter. These included awaking at night to see strange creatures, levitation from bed, and temporary paralysis while something was done to the genitals. He also described their encounter with a UFO and the period of missing time. Jim's doc- tors advised him to contact a UFO researcher as they felt that Jim and his friends may have been involved in a UFO abduction experience. Jim contacted me during one of my UFO lectures in the Boston area. In January of 1989,1 initiated a formal investigation with MUFON Investigator and CEIII/IV specialist, David Webb (Solar Physicist) and with MUFON Consultant, Anthony (Tony) Constantino (Professional Hypnotist). It was conducted in a careful and meticulous manner over a period of 24 months. It was obvious to us that the period of missing time had to be sandwiched between sighting the object and reaching shore. The beam of light hitting the canoe seemed to be the dividing point between memory and amnesia. During the first of a long series of hypnosis sessions, it was decided to concentrate on this segment of the terrifying encounter. Under hypnosis, all four witnesses relived detailed and traumatic UFO abduction experiences during the pe- riod of missing time. All were transferred from their ca- noe into the UFO by the hollow tube-like beam of light. On board, they encountered strange humanoid crea- tures that exerted some kind of mind control over them so that they could not resist their demands. A ll were made to undress and sit on a plastic-like bench in an area illuminated by diffuse white light. After looking at their eyes and in their mouths with a pencil-sized rod with a light on its tip, the aliens placed them in a harness and flexed their arms and legs. Then, one by one they were made to lie on a table where each was examined by a number of strange hand-held and larger machine-like instruments that were lowered over their bodies. During this segment of the examination, the alien entities removed samples of saliva, skin scrap- ings, blood, feces, urine and sperm from each of the ab- ductees. After the examinations, the abductees were made to dress and enter another room which had a round portal in one of its walls. They were lined up and made to walk into the portal. Strange sensations surged through their bodies as they found themselves floating down the hol- low beam of light into their canoe which was now in shallow water near their campsite. The tube-like light seemed to hold the canoe steady as each was placed in it in the same seating positions they were in prior to the abduction. As the hypnosis sessions continued, much detail was recovered about their on board experience. Also, it was PAGE 4 NUMBER 300 APRIL 1993"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL discovered that the twins had had bedtime visitations by alien creatures and abduction experiences since early childhood. These experiences were relived in vivid de- tail under hypnosis. During the course of the investigation an extraordi- nary event occurred. Jack and his wife Mary were ab- ducted from their remote mountain home in Townshend,Vermont. During the night of May 20, 1988, Jack's dog woke him up when he scratched at the door wanting to go out to relieve itself. When Jack got up to put him out, he was shocked to see a blue light shining through the kitchen window. He went out to look and saw a glowing object hovering over the field adjoining his house. He decided to bring the dog back in. In the morning, he thought he had dreamed about the whole thing. However, under hypnosis, he relived a shared abduction experience with his wife in minute detail. Mary only remembered dream- ing about deer with big eyes coming to their bedside. She did not respond to hypnosis. The following is an ex- cerpt from Jack's hypnosis sessions. \"It's blue. A blue light. And I think, 'That's funny. That's not the moon.' And then I go to the window and I look out the window and what I see is amazing. I see a big, bright light and it's right over the truck in the field outside the house. And I'm thinking, 'Oh my God! I can't believe that!' And so I say, 'Mary, get up. Get up and look!' And I run to the door and I go out the door and I'm running towards the light up in the field . . . Then I see the dog running alongside me ... And so I pick him up and I run back to the house. . . The light is still there and it's moving . . . And then I put the dog back in bed and I'm thinking, 'I don't want to do this. I don't want to do this now!' I don't want to look at the light... So I'm going back to bed ... And I'm thinking, 'I don't want to deal with this now. Why are they here now?' And I'm scared ... so I pull the covers over my head . . . and Mary's next to me. And then I know, I know that something's in the house. I just know that they're there and I'm under the covers and I think, 'Oh God, oh God! Why are they here now? I don't want this to happen.' (Gasps) And then the covers move and I feel something on the cover . . . And then the covers are down and I'm looking there and I was right. They're right there! Oh God! They're right there, right next to my bed ... It has big eyes and a big head and it's dark and there's light behind it coming in the door. And it's just taking the covers away and I don't want to look at it ... And I look at Mary ... There's another one there and it's next to Mary. And I wish that I could do something but I can't. I have to do what they want. And the light is out there and they want me to go out there . . . They're lifting me. Mary's standing and they're making us move towards light . . . And the dog isn't doing anything. We're through the door . . . We walk up the lawn and I feel like I'm floating ... our feet are on the ground, but my feet are not doing what I want them to.\" Jack and Mary were brought to stand in front of a huge house-sized glowing object sitting on a blue light that enveloped its underside. The glow around the object itself was changing colors from white to yellow to or- ange and purple and back to white. No noise emanated from the object, but the air was filled with the acrid smell of ozone. Then, Jack and Mary were made to walk into the blue light under the object. Instantaneously they were transferred inside of the glowing object. Mary was separated from Jack, who was made to undergo examinations similar to the one that he and his friends had experienced twelve years earlier. After the exami- nation, Mary rejoined Jack and they were literally floated across the lawn from the craft to their house, through the unopened front door and to their bedroom, where they went back to bed in a strange lethargic state of mind. This experience left physical evidence behind in the form of burns on the bottom of Jack's feet. Jack also re- ceived a biopsy-like scoop mark above his ankle during still another abduction. The scoopmark was located just above a scar left behind during an operation for an anomalous lump that had appeared overnight on Jack's leg several years prior. Jack's local doctor thought it was a cyst, but was unable to drain it so referred Jack to a surgeon who removed it. Jack was told that local pathologists did not know what it was and that it had been sent to the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia, for further analysis. However, when we checked Jack's medical records, we found that it was sent to military pathologists in Washington, D.C.. where it was examined by a United States Air Force Colonel. Attempts for further informa- tion about the anomalous lump were thwarted as the sur- geon would not cooperate with our enquiry. D uring the course of the investigation we conducted witness background checks, examined medical records and diaries, cross-checked witness testimony, co- ordinated witness psychological profile tests, correlated witness accounts with other reports and conducted fif- teen hypnosis sessions over a period of 14 months. The final 10-volume report numbered over 700 pages. It was made available to UFO researchers and became the basis of a book on UFO abductions to be published by Time-Life. In summation, this UFO abduction case is unique in a number of ways. It involved four credible persons who all consciously shared the same close-encounter with a UFO in 1976 during a canoe trip along the Allagash Waterway in Northern Maine. All percipients experienced missing time and relived traumatic com- plementary UFO abduction experiences under hypnosis. Two of the abductees are identical twins, which was of great interest to their alien abductors. Our enquiry re- vealed that each of the witnesses exhibited the typical benchmarks characteristic of other abductees. Lastly, APRIL 1993 NUMBER 300 PAGES"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL all of the witnesses are artists and were able to provide detailed sketches of different aspects of their experi- ences. This has provided the UFO research community some excellent impressions relating to the appearance of alien beings, their instruments and their craft. The many-faceted and intriguing elements of The Allagash Abductions also provided a catalyst for a de- tailed correlation of the witnesses' experiences with benchmarks exhibited in other abduction reports being investigated and studied. Such were derived from an ex- haustive survey of 270 reported UFO abductions in the United States and abroad compiled by Dr. Thomas E. Bullard of the University of Indiana. Some major simi- larities noted were: alien interest in the reproduction system and the extraction of sperm from each of the wit- nesses; a series of UFO and related paranormal experi- ences that dated back to early childhood; physical marks on the percipients' bodies typical of those on the bodies of other UFO abductees; and, the overnight appearance of a lump above the tibia of one of the twins. In addition, all witnesses were subjected to detailed interrogations, rigorous character reference checks, 12 recorded/transcribed hypnotic regression sessions and a battery of psychological profile tests. We also examined a number of alternate theories advanced to explain UFO abductions: hoaxes, fantasy-prone personalities, psy- choses, birth trauma memories and archetypical images from the collective unconscious. Each of these theo- ries was critiqued and eliminated in the light of the ev- idence collected during our investigation. The investigation concluded that the moral character of the witnesses, the graphic reliving of their experiences under hypnosis and the extraordinary correlations be- tween their experience and that of others provided over- whelming evidence that their experiences were objective in nature. Such evidence combined with typical physical effects on the witnesses' bodies prompted me to evalu- ate this case in the great significance category.

LETTERS - Continued from Page 19 INTER/INTRADIMENSIONAL Various persons have inquired, through letters to the Journal and in person, for clarification of my term \"in- tradimensional\" as used in my March 1992 \"Resisting Alien Abductions\" article. One reader inquired if I re- ferred to 1) a spatial dimension; or 2) hidden dimensions such as in H. P. Lovecraft's books; or 3) the \"astral plane,\" where psychic phenomena (astral projection, telepathy, etc.) are supposed to take place. Lovecraft's writings are fiction, and have nothing to do with ufology. The term \"astral plane\" as used by my inquiring reader, is imprecise. Although many \"abductees\" report that they seem to be \"out-of-body\" during abductions, not enough is known about the OBE altered state to link it directly to the interdimen- sional hypothesis. Other psychic phenomena such as telepathy, clairvoyance, clairaudience, precognitive dreams, etc. seem to be widespread human talents which may or may not be \"interdimensional.\" My own experience with remote-viewing under laboratory conditions seems to indicate that it works within our physical universe, but this is a purely subjective observation. Parapsychologists, although they have been trying for over a century, have not yet deter- mined the source or nature of psychic phenomena. The \"intradimensional hypothesis,\" as used by me, refers to the hypothesis that there are other dimensions besides our four-dimensional physical world (three space dimensions and one time dimension). For example, Theodor Franz Kaluza's 1919 proposal to Einstein of a five-dimensional theory of gravity interested Einstein be- cause a fifth spatial dimension provided enough \"room\" to fit the electromagnetic force into Einstein's theory of gravity, a problem which Einstein had been unable to solve. Mathematicians of the present day continue study into the multidimensional theory. The implication for ufology, of course, is that other dimensions might be peopled by intelligent, non-hu- man creatures. Following out this assumption, it is hy- pothesized that abducting entities interpenetrate from their own dimension into our own space-time, work their mischief, and disappear back into their own di- mension, leaving little or no verifiable traces. As Jacques Vallee has described in his book Dimensions, writing about incubi, faerie folk, etc. and as Gordon Creighton has so elegantly written about the jinns of the Muslim world in FSR (Flying Saucer Review), there seems little doubt that the human race has been harassed for thousands of years by non-physical in- telligences whose true nature and motives remain a mystery. The \"abducting entities\" currently being stud- ied avidly by ufology, in my opinion, might have noth- ing at all to do with physical UFOs, but are simply an old human problem, currently posing as \"UFO ex- traterrestrials.\" The situation cries out for continued study by objective minds. —Ann Druffel Pasadena, CA Address letters to the editor, Dennis Stacy, Box 12434, San Antonio, TX 78212.

Webb O n October 9, 1992, about 7:50 p.m. EOT, hundreds of people from Kentucky to the District of Columbia were awed by a green- to-orange fireball that moved slowly across the sky on a flat southwest-to-northeast trajectory before break- ing up over southeastern New York state. The fiery object dropped a 27-pound stony meteorite through the trunk of Michelle Knapp's parked 1980 Chevy Malibu in Peekskill, New York. Because it was a Friday night in autumn, many of the witnesses happened to be attending high school football games, resulting in at least two dozen videos of the aer- ial event. (As we all know, camcorders have become in- creasingly important tools in capturing elusive aerial objects.) Recently Bernard Haugen, a MUFON State Section Director in North Carolina (Oxford), asked me if I would review one of the videos of the object which was shown on Durham's WTVD. Subsequently, Field Investigator trainee Joe Moore of Butner forwarded the tape to me. The video was shot by television cameraman Brad Loch, who was covering a football contest in Fayetteville. His equipment caught about seven seconds of the me- teor's nearly horizontal path as it passed over the bleach- ers. The object appeared in the sky as a teardrop shape with a short wiggling tail. Complicating matters was a false report on the WTVD newscast that the object \"had fallen to the ground\" east of Morgantown, West Virginia, \"is still glowing,\" and \"police have cordoned off the area.\" (At my request Haugen attempted to track down this rumor. It may have been spawned in part by the ap- parent proximity of the fireball as it passed over the lo- cal horizon. It is a common illusion that bright meteors seem much closer than they really are, appearing to fall or land \"in the next field\" or \"just over the hill.\") I have investigated many slow-fireball sightings, and I can state unequivocally that the Fayetteville object was indeed a fireball. The colors, long duration, and nearly level path are not particularly unusual fea- tures of large meteors. Their variable colors are due to a mix of glowing atmospheric gases surrounding the meteoroid, the object's own stripped-off elements, and decelerating velocities as the object plunges through denser layers of air. The October 9 fireball exceeded 17 seconds on some videotapes and may have approached half a minute in to- tal duration. \"The Great Northeast Fireball\" of March 6, 1991, was visible in broad daylight for some 30 seconds. It followed a similar flat trajectory and covered at least 600 miles, like the October object. (One widely quoted airline pilot called the '91 fireball \"the mother of all me- teors\"!) Perhaps the most famous long-lived meteor of recent times was the one seen and photographed from the Western U.S. on August 10, 1972. This bright day- time fireball plodded along for up to a full minute or more! It was generally believed to have been an asteroid that was temporarily captured in Earth orbit before es- caping back into space. It is a myth that all meteors must \"fall,\" that is, follow steep downward arcs. The path depends upon the mete- oroid's entry angle into the atmosphere. Four of the five spectacular fireballs which I investigated in recent years had nearly horizontal trajectories. For ufologists the supposed anomalousness of green meteors flying horizontally stretches back to the green fireball (GFB) furor of the late 1940s and early '50s. The green hue is actually quite common in many fireballs. The color can come from either atmospheric oxygen glowing around the meteoroid (the same ele- ment associated with the production of the green auro- ra borealis) or from magnesium which is abundant in stony meteorites. Yet another source of this spectral color may be frozen nitrogen present in glowing icy meteoroids, the leftovers of old comets. In fact, most meteors, including many large fireballs, are of cometary origin — ice and dust conglomerations that vaporize completely in the atmosphere, disappearing before striking the Earth's surface. (Dare I say that this might account for the famed GFBs?) No question that some fireballs do appear anomalous to first-time observers. The New England fireball of June 14,1990, produced a number of UFO reports. This object flashed bluish-white bursts of light bright enough to cast moving shadows on the ground and was fol- lowed by a delayed sonic boom after it disappeared. One excited woman thought she was being visited by a UFO. She reported the bluish-white light shining through her bedroom window and then felt a \"vibrating and pulsating ... It was like the ground was shaking un- derneath me.\" In this article I have used several related terms — me- teor, meteoroid and meteorite. A meteor refers to the vis- ible light surrounding an incoming space particle or mass — a meteoroid. A meteoroid that survives its fiery journey through the atmosphere and lands on the Earth's surface is called a meteorite. Incidentally, I owe a debt of gratitude to MUFON in- vestigators in my region who have often contacted me with sighting reports following the passage of an unusual fireball. Not only have I received these reports voluntarily from MUFON State Directors and other UFO investi- gators in New England, but I have also availed myself of this valuable resource by actively seeking fireball reports from these same individuals.

By Walter H. Andrus, Jr. Beginning in January of this year, authors Joseph Stefula, Richard Butler and George Hansen began cir- culating a 25-page document titled \"A Critique of Budd Hopkins' Case of the UFO Abduction of Linda Napolitano.\" Stefula is a former Special Agent for the U. S. Army Criminal Investigations Command and a former MUFON State Director for New Jersey. Richard Butler is a former law enforcement and secu- rity police specialist for the U. S. Air Force, now researching abductions and government cover-up. George Hansen is an author and parapsychologist liv- ing in New Jersey. The document has been published whole or in part in several UFO newsletters, including the HUFON Report, and on various electronic bulletin boards. As we go to press, we understand that it is also scheduled to be printed, in whole or in part, in the March/April issue of the International UFO Reporter, edited by Jerry Clark and published by the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies. C lark invited several of the people denigrated in the \"critique\" by Stefula, Butler and Hansen to write a rejoinder to be published concurrently with their rambling article in IUR. After heading up the Mutual UFO Network for 22 years, I have firmly es- tablished my personal integrity and credibility in the field of Ufology, therefore feel it is unnecessary to re- spond to implied character assassination or to defend the stature of MUFON to three publicity-seeking agitators. The following narrative, then, is basically an update to the two articles published in the MUFON UFO Journal by Budd Hopkins about the \"Linda Cortile\" case for the benefit of UFO researchers. As a participant in the October 3, 1992 meeting at Budd Hopkins' apart- ment in New York City, I welcome the opportunity to share with readers what actually occurred at the called meeting. In previous correspondence with Budd Hopkins, Stefula, Butler and Hansen asked for a hearing of their charges that the case was a hoax perpetrated by Linda. Mr. Hopkins made a wise decision by giving them a tribunal to present their evidence to a panel of qualified and vitally interested researchers, including those of us who are now responding to their accusations. LINDA ON TRIAL Linda, her husband and two sons related their indi- vidual experiences in an environment reminiscent of a courtroom trial. Rich Butler, acting on behalf of the claimants, represented them as a proverbial antagonis- tic prosecuting attorney, working from a prepared list of charges. Linda was literally on trial. After several hours of crossrexamining Linda and presenting their own testimony, Butler and Stefula reluctantly admitted that there was insufficient evidence to support their hoax theory. They conceded that there were a few inconsistencies in the statements made to them by Linda, in a private interview, versus what she had told Budd Hopkins. Even though Butler and Stefula were embarrassed by their lack of evidence to prove their hoax claim, they have continued to write articles for potential publication, probably encouraged by George Hansen. However, based upon their knowledge of the case, they felt that Linda should file charges to prosecute the two security men, identified previously as \"Rich\" and \"Dan,\" for kidnapping and physical assault. Since we have been unable to positively identify the security agency employing Rich and Dan, going to the New York City Police Department and filing charges for such an unusual event might have made Linda's pre- posterous story look like a joke in the eyes of police of- ficials. Linda was also reluctant to file charges because she felt that if Rich and Dan were government agents, they were only acting in behalf of national security. It was the considered opinion of several of us present that under the circumstances this would have been a futile and non-productive method to secure restitution from Rich and Dan. It would have meant attempting to sue an unknown security agency through a mailing of letters to all possible such organizations within the U.S. Government. This case has ramifications far more im- portant than suing Rich and Dan. MORE WITNESSES Since there were many more witnesses to the event on the Brooklyn Bridge, and an unknown number of po- tential witnesses in automobiles also stalled near the security vehicle manned by Richard and Dan, it was considered prudent to refrain from filing any court suits that might squelch potential volunteer witnesses from coming forward to testify. It is still imperative that Rich and Dan reveal their last names and agree to testify publicly or in confidence as witnesses. If the identity of the \"third man\" could definitely be confirmed and if he would agree to share his experiences, this would literally \"blow the lid\" off the reality of the UFO abduction sce- nario. Strong speculation exists that the visual abduction of Linda was staged for the dignitary's benefit, because he experienced the \"full treatment,\" so to speak. PAGES NUMBER 300 APRIL 1993"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Based upon the significant importance of such dis- closures by the dignitary and additional witnesses, Jerry Clark and I made an appeal to the team of Stefula, Butler and Hansen to refrain from making a formal re- quest for a federal investigation of the government agents responsible for the alleged felonies for at least six months This would allow time for other witnesses to come forward and permit present witnesses to testify pub- licly. On October 3, 1992, Joe Stefula was MUFON's New Jersey State Director, whereas Rich Butler and George Hansen had no MUFON affiliation. After mak- ing a sincere appeal to these three men, both Joe Stefula and Richard Butler consented to the proposal to \"buy valuable time.\" Hansen, on the other hand, became very belligerent, refusing to concede to the six-month de- lay, and flatly stated that he was personally going to file charges as a citizen of the U.S.A. The meeting effectively adjourned, since it was apparent that as an outsider. Hansen had decided to disregard any recommendations and to take things into his own hands, irrespective of how it might hurt Linda and her immediate family. Mr. Hansen has no connections whatsoever with the UFO community and apparently feels that by denigrat- ing the major personalities in UFO and abduction re- search, he could thus elevate his own questionable stature. After two somewhat threatening calls to Walt Andrus, George proceeded to forge ahead on his own. The January 8, 1993 article, \"A Critique of Budd Hopkins' Case of the UFO Abduction of Linda Napolitano,\" was spitefully written, apparently in hopes that someone would publish it. W hile I have no intention of responding to the claims, falsehoods and implied innuendos that are so prevalent in the article, obviously written by George Hansen, but also signed and supported by Joe Stefula and Richard Butler, I do feel that it is imperative to mention one item which the trio has proposed to ex- plain their suspicions that Linda orchestrated the story. They selected passages, names of characters and events from the science fiction novel Night Eyes by Garfield Reeves-Stevens, published in Canada in April 1989, a few months before Linda revealed her abduction expe- rience to Budd Hopkins. In order to make these claims sound legitimate, it was necessary to change names and events throughout the book to find similarities between Night Eyes and the Linda case. They imply that Linda read the science fiction book and then proceeded to or- chestrate the entire event, witnesses and all. Is this sci- entific research or simply, a \"shot in the dark\" by three disgruntled individuals? Again, I have no intention of debating or refuting point by point 25 pages of typed single-spaced accusa- tions, references to diverse publications, a science fiction book and even fantasy role-playing in the game \"Dungeons and Dragons.\" What does the latter game have to do with scientific UFO research? George A. Filer, III, who replaced Joe Stefula as New Jersey State Director, was also present and lis- tened attentively at the October 3rd meeting. Mr. Filer offered me an insight into what may have prompted Mr. Stefula to become a party to this debunking exercise. Having been trained in police investigative techniques, Joe has difficulty accepting evidence in his own mind that is not purely black or white. He has also admitted to Mr. Filer that he really does not believe in the reality of UFOs, therefore, like Philip Klass, he may have been searching for an alternative explanation to the abduction scenario. Richard Butler professes to be an abductee and was attending Budd Hopkins' abduction support group sessions where he met Linda. Butler brought Joe Stefula as a guest to two sessions, where he interro- gated two females present until they were in tears. As a distinct outsider, George Hansen injected himself into the Linda case by volunteering his writing ability, ap- parently hoping to gain some degree of recognition in the UFO field, regardless of whether it was positive or negative. CASE OF THE CENTURY? Both Stefula and Butler totally disregard the eyewit- ness testimony of Rich, Dan, the dignitary and the lady on the bridge, and then deny that such people really exist. If they are actually trained in police investigative techniques, as they profess, they must be cognizant that eyewitness testimony is acceptable in a court of law. It is difficult for me to understand that on one hand, the wit- nesses do not exist, and in the next breath they want to sue them for alleged felonies. George Hansen has written to several government departments demanding that they conduct an investiga- tion into their agents' atrocities. The U.S. Secret Service contacted Linda and scheduled an interview with her which was also attended by Budd Hopkins. After hear- ing their testimony, the two special agents made an of- ficial report for their records and thanked Linda and Budd for their cooperation. They advised Linda that if any other agency should contact her, she should simply refer them to the Secret Service special agents who conducted the interview for further information. Apparently, they did not take Hansen's claims seriously, treating him as another eccentric or \"crank writer.\" In conclusion, after nearly 30 years in the UFO field, I have developed a sensitivity to recognizing witnesses who are prevaricating or fabricating a story. I am con- vinced that Linda is telling the truth as she knows it. She is mentally and physically incapable of planning and im- plementing a hoax scenario of this magnitude. I predict that continued investigation of reports from additional witnesses and public disclosures by the known wit- nesses will confirm that the Linda case is indeed \"The Case of the Century.\" APRIL 1993 NUMBER 300 PAGE 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL \"REPTILIANS AND OTHER UNMENTIONABLES\" A ny individual who enters this field of research brings with him a set of beliefs with boundaries for acceptance or rejection. This is naturally based on the in- dividual's level of comfort and openness with accepting any of the weird information dumped into his naive hands. UFO researchers have been fairly willing to ac- cept a generous portion of this bizarre data but always retain a personal, often private, preference for the amount of \"weird stuff' they are willing to accept as credible. I am constantly amused at the notion that a re- searcher of incredible abductions by aliens in UFOs could label anything as \"too weird\"! Yet, as human be- ings, it is our nature to \"draw the line\" somewhere based on our need to provide a sense of comfortable or- der to the chaotic and bizarre influx of strange informa- tion. It seems to take a great deal of personal maturity, security and ego-strength to publicly acknowledge and willingly support some of the data which others label as \"too crazy.\" Our boundaries do shift and expand over time as we become more at ease. History provides an important perspective on the shifting boundaries of belief and disbelief. Decades ago the first hurdle surpassed was the basic acceptance that UFOs might actually exist in our earthly skies. But to believe that they could contact the soil or land under in- telligent control was absurd, at least until enough odd soil samples and credible witness reports forced an ac- ceptance of this possibility. Then it became unthink- able that people could claim seeing little beings in con- junction with,a landed craft. Even crazier of course would be the idea that such beings would overpower hu- mans with paralysis and float them aboard for exams! But look at how our collective boundaries of accep- tance have stretched over the decades of research into this endless jungle of weirdness. This is basically due to the endless flow of new cases which, when researched carefully and methodically, are today considered as more reliable, credible, acceptable, and also supportive of data patterns from previous decades. On the horizon are issues of genetic manipulation, spirituality, chan- neling, multiple dimensions and paranormal correla- tions. Most of these areas of interest are presently viewed as \"too weird\" or \"without scientific founda- tion,\" which is what James Pringle, a prestigious British scientist, claimed about reports of meteorites in 1759, until a wealth of data forced acceptance of \"rocks falling from the sky\" within the next 100 years! There is a fairly large gray basket to which other alien types are presently relegated. Why? They are judged either \"too weird,\" \"too unlikely,\" or \"too few to be significant.\" After all, the little gray humanoids have acquired enough notoriety in the media to become the publicly-accepted image of how an alien is supposed to appear. Now that the public is beginning to accept the \"little grays,\" why confuse them with stranger or less be- lievable alien types? Laughter would certainly greet the notion of a seven-foot-tall lizard that likes sex with our women. I believe many researchers have \"drawn the line\" as an effort to not lose ground in the war for cred- ibility; so we keep the lizards, tall blondes and praying mantises under a quiet lid in that bulging gray basket. (Can we hide them any longer?) However, as researchers began to share some of the oddities in their gray baskets, they began to find amaz- ing matches and similarities, not only among physical traits, but also in behavior and purpose. In my own caseload I found a woman reporting (much to her own amazement) at least one experience each with little grays, a reptilian and tall blondes, having never read or heard of the latter two types. Her details and drawings impressed Jenny Randies of England at the Abduction Study Conference held at M.I.T. in Boston during 1992. Jenny responded that the characteristics, presence, man- ner, and behavior of the tall blonde were nearly the same word-for-word descriptions as in many of her ab- duction cases in England—a clear majority of which are the \"tall blondes\" rather than the little grays! Here then are those details for your own consumption and study: TALL BLONDES OR NORDICS 1. Height: 6-8 feet tall in general 2. Human in features: well-developed, muscular 3. Hair: shoulder-length, blonde, straight, fine or thin 4. Facial characteristics: \"very handsome\" by report 5. \"Perfect features\" like those of a model 6. Manner: paternal, watchful, protective, kind 7. Effect: subjects report an overwhelming sense of safety, warmth, almost entrancement by a power- fully positive presence 8. Eyes: blue, kind and loving — not cold 9. Facial expression: pleasant, smiling, joyful, positive 10. Clothes: human style, form-fitting jumpsuit or uni- form 11. Communication: usually telepathic despite human appearance 12. Misc: \"seems psychic, wise, all-knowing\" T he public generally expects aliens to appear different — not like a Hollywood hunk; \"these cannot be true aliens!\" It would be difficult to prove in psychological circles that these images are not projec- tions of one's wish fulfillment for a fatherly, handsome protector to rescue one from worldly troubles or a boring marriage. Others say that these encounters are with \"guardian angels\" rather than aliens. Because these be- ings have also been seen aboard UFOs with little grays, PAGE 10 NUMBER 300 APRIL 1993"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL some researchers believe that they are either hybrids or holographic images for distraction, trickery, calming or reassurance. A few researchers believe the tall blondes might actually be supervising the little grays and that the grays may just be computerized androids, or- ganic robots or a cloned subservient race of workers. In the 1975 case of Travis Walton, he disrupts the \"standard\" procedure of the little grays who then leave the room. A tall blonde then enters and seems more in charge. Trusting these more human-appearing entities, he is recaptured. Even in the files of Leonard Stringfield's crash/retrieval accounts is one allegedly retrieved body of unknown origin which is seven feet tall, with human features and shoulder-length blonde hair. Whatever or whoever they are, they keep surfacing worldwide in abduction cases with striking similarity. As charming and kind as the tall blondes seem, the Reptilian brand of alien life form is a hideous, rude and aggressive type. It is difficult to imagine a higher-func- tioning seven-foot-tall lizard strolling into your bed- room (The Japanese might like this breed due to their cinema craze over Godzilla!). I have close to ten of these odd cases; none of those subjects had ever heard of such a type. Yet there are again many similarities in description and behavior: REPTILIANS 1. Height: 6-8 feet tall, upright always 2. Features: lizard-like scales, smooth texture 3. Color: greenish to brownish 4. Hands: four-finger claw with brown webbing 5. Face: cross between human and snake 6. Head: central ridge coming down from top of head to snout 7. Chest: external \"ribbing\" may be visible 8. Eyes: cat-like with vertical slit, gold iris 9. Effect: repulsive, grotesque, disgusting 10. Manner: intrusive, forceful, insensitive 11. Behavior: intrudes and rapes 12. Physical effect: large claw marks photographed 13. Communication: none reported! M ore psychological projections? Symbolic confabulations of evil or sin — as initially im- plied in the Biblical account of the Garden of Eden? Cannot anyone imagine a \"nice snake?\" Is there always a sinister or deceptive manner about these creatures? Why do they seem to occur more frequently in certain geographic areas despite being reported independently? Where would the public have been able to read about these basically unpublished scoundrels? One of my cases sheepishly admits to having an incredible orgasm while being totally repulsed by the intruder's grotesque appearance. Within two months a second female from the same town reported independently the same type of Not all aliens are little grays as It turns out. Aside from the tall charming Nordic types, rude and aggressive Lizards have been reported, too. Will other aliens soon be coming out of the closet as well? Reptilian intruder, with the same surprising and em- barrassing orgasmic response! No crafts are typically seen; no communication oc- curs. The same scenario occurs over and over through- out my cases and those of other researchers — especially in Oklahoma and California. And researchers do not like talking about them publicly; nobody can even pic- ture how a seven-foot-tall lizard could have sex with a human female! (This weird stuff gets crammed into our gray baskets and buried!) But something is going on here that needs to be boldly studied more openly and publicly — especially among researchers. Patterns of similarity from sane humans are emerging despite our gray basket rituals of stuffing them away. Then there is the insectoid/grasshopper/praying man- tis type that seems to also oversee or direct activity in a supervisory role. Why would anyone imagine a large bug directing an abduction experience? Is this something we would hope for or desire to see? Subjects sense a higher level of wisdom and functioning in this type of entity. Whatever its purpose or origin, we certainly need further study. I encourage those of you who have either experienced such oddities or have researched these types, to begin dumping out your gray baskets and shar- ing this bizarre data. Only in response to this column or in sharing the data openly with each other can we begin to get a better grasp on these unusual types of beings and how they may fit into the larger puzzle of the abduction phenomenon.

By Don Worley T wenty years ago the rural folk of South Tennessee experienced a startling series of strange encoun- ters with UFOs, entities and the elusive Men in Black. Some of these occurrences are now almost com- monplace, others aren't. They included periods of miss- ing time, abduction and examination aboard a UFO, voices heard in the head, so-called ''screen memories,\" large, black American sedans — both Cadillacs and Lincoln Continentals were reported — with mysterious \"oriental-looking\" types inside and much more. The central focus of these events, which took place between 1973 and 1977, appeared to be one Stanley Ingram, from whom I had many personal communica- tions over the years. A cattle farmer, Stanley had been a city judge and manager, and also wrote a local newspa- per column for The Pulaski Citizen. The sequence of en- counters started when he and his daughter Becky, then 14, began to look for UFOs from a fire watchtower on the county line. One night the two sat in the home of a man named David Swanner, who had earlier experienced \"voices-in- the-head\" and an apparent abduction. For some reason the jumbled voice suddenly zeroed in on Becky. While at school the following week, the voice became clearer and repeatedly urged her to go to the football field for a ride. Stanley urged her to keep the appointment since he believed the Ufonauts were friendly and hoped he might be contacted, too. After some reluctance on Becky's part, the encounter finally took place. Inside the apparent craft, Becky met two beings with stick-on suits and pointed chins who mentally assured her that no harm would come to her. \"Alton\" and \"Tombo\" were short, with dark eyes, small features and thin necks, and claimed to be from the planet Plantos. The room into which they led her was colored black and white; at one end was a console with flashing lights and several swivel chairs. Becky wound up flat on her back on a hospital-like bed. One little being moved a glove-like device on the end of its graceful woman-like hand over her legs and then further up. After she was let out of the craft, she had to sit down for a few minutes from weakness. Back home, Becky was frightened and confused. She felt weak and sleepy for several weeks and often nodded off in school. At home she slept for hours on the family couch and complained of having to urinate frequently. Medical help was sought, but it was some six weeks be- fore she fully recovered. Over the next few years both Becky and Swanner would be abducted after the \"voice\" called each to iso- Becky was frightened and confused. She felt weak and often nodded off in school. At home she slept for hours on the family couch and complained of having to urinate frequently. lated spots; on most occasions they would remember lit- tle or nothing of what happened. They did have vague recall of being flown over a large city and Swanner once thought he was taken to Hawaii; Becky was given a tour of the engine room. In all probability these were what we now know as \"screen memories,\" cover stories for various alien activities. Needless to say, these ac- counts left everyone with raised eyebrows with the ex- ception of Stanley. After Swanner's first trip his watch stopped, leaving a brown patch of skin underneath. He bought another watch, but it stopped, too. Then he borrowed Stanley's, which also quit working. (Curiously, these watches would deflect a compass needle). About a week or so later the aliens told Swanner that Stanley's watch was now working fine. He retrieved it from the drawer where he had put it and found this to be the case. It continued to run thereafter. In fact, Swanner often got messages from the aliens directed to Stanley personally. But trying to follow them up only succeeded in making Stanley look like a fool. On one occasion the Ufonauts showed Swanner a chart of earthquake zones and times, information seemingly corroborated by the \"dreams\" of four other people in the community. Stanley duly published the predictions in his column—and nothing happened. A similar incident in- volved an alleged perpetual motion machine. Not sur- prisingly, Stanley's original hope and trust now began to shift toward distrust and frustration. T he next incident proved even more revealing. While aboard the UFO, Swanner was finally allowed to copy down the formula for a UFO propul- sion system, which Stanley promptly locked in his safe. In June of 1974, while on his way home from work, Swanner was passed by a large black sedan with California license plates. The passengers inside flashed an open attache case, stuffed with money. On June 27th, Swanner was stopped in an alley and asked to accept $500,000 for the \"formula.\" Frightened and suspicious, he refused, and his interlocutors sped away in a cloud of dust.

All ap- peared to be 30-40 years of age, heavy-set, with round dark faces and piercing eyes slanted upward on the out- side edges, giving an oriental appearance. They wore black suits, white shirts and black ties, and spoke in low, unexcited voices that sounded \"Chinese.\" Sometime in September they approached both Swanner and Becky, but again backed off. Then on February 5, 1975, at twilight, a big auto cut Becky off on a rural road. Four MIB jumped out, re- volvers in hand, drug Becky from her car, and demanded \"Where is the formula?\" (In all probability they knew where the formula was.) At any rate, Becky was struck with several blows. Incensed, her father summoned the sheriff and several armed neighbors, but that evening's search turned up nothing. Nor was anyone ever able to capture the car's long license plate number. This re- mains one of the rare instances in which MIB were re- ported to have used brute force. Although Stanley was never allowed to participate personally in the same way that his daughter Becky and Swanner were, it was apparent that he was the real target of these activities. In the face of repeated disap- pointment (and outside ridicule of both him and his daughter), he waged an unbelievably incredible struggle to understand what was going on and why. I can't help but think that his valiant efforts greatly contributed to his subsequent death by heart attack in late December of 1982. Don Worley is a MUFON state section director for Indiana.

The Winter 1993 issue of the MUFON-NYC Newsletter continues to show steady improvement under editor Greenfield and the art direction of Sal Amendola, who also contributes articles. As far as layout goes, my only complaint is that my ever aging eyes have problems with some of the finer print. The newsletter is 12 pages long and is published four times a year.

Certainly worth checking out if you live in the New York area. STRANGE MAGAZINE Editor/publisher Mark Chorvinsky has definitely carved out a niche for himself with this consistently entertain- ing, informative and article-packed publication, a spiri- tual off-shoot of England's Fortean Times. Whereas FT has recently gone glitzy, Strange still exudes a deter- mined homemade folksiness that welcomes everyone into its pages and makes those involved, readers, writers and reviewers alike, feel like active participants in the on-going exploration of the odd and unusual. This is kitchen-counter publishing at its finest. As mentioned, each 64-page issue is jam-packed with fully footnoted feature articles, columns, letters and a slew of book, video and movie reviews, along with shorter items. Chorvinsky himself frequently contributes articles and doesn't mind in the least exposing a hoax when he finds one. The writing overall is generally top- notch. The topics covered include the whole panoply of fortean phenomena, from UFOs to the Loch Ness Monster, examples which hardly do the contents justice. Issues centering on a specific theme are not un- usual, and in fact, Strange Number 10 focuses on Humanoids of all sorts and persuasion, featuring es- says by Jerome Clark, John Keel, Nigel Watson and others, making it must-reading for any self-respecting ufologist. Columnists this time around include Loren Coleman (cryptozoology), Douglas Chapman (general forteana) and Rick Gregory (books). Number 10 also in- cludes Chorvinsky's 6th annual \"Ten Strangest List,\" the top ten strange stories of the year. (Marian Visions beat out the Manila Vampire and Mystery Hums.)

I believe it to be a landmark case which involved the complete cooperation of several agencies in Canada, including the Department of National Defense. DND has participated actively in the investigation to the extent of providing an alert team ready to respond to any continued helicopter harass- ment activity at the site and nearby witness residences. Although we have interviewed several witnesses to this helicopter activity, we have yet to identify the perpetra- tors in spite of several photographs taken at times of in- trusion. Transport Canada has been quite cooperative in pro- viding classified radar data at the site location. The National Research Council has been receptive to my investigation of Guardian's claims and classified heli- copter research activity and has provided access to CSIS, the Canadian Secret Intelligence Service. Energy, Mines and Resources have provided aerial photogra- phy for the research area. Canadian UFO author Arthur Bray and researcher Graham Lightfoot have added in- valuable assistance in the investigation. CUFORN, the Canadian UFO Research Network has been helpful in providing me with a background on Guardian's prior UFO report for 1989 and original materials they re- ceived from Guardian, including photographs and video tape. Broadcasts of the investigation by network televi- sion on NBC-TV's \"Unsolved Mysteries\" and the Fox Network's \"Sightings\" program clearly validate Guardian's forecast of widespread exposure of alien UFO activity in the Ottawa Valley area. Television at- tention of this caliber should give significant credit to the investigation and open the door for those reluctant to come forward for fear of ridicule. These broadcasts provide the first international exposure for this case, which centers around the events, instead of on the anonymous Guardian who videotaped the extraordinary landing event. Guardian began reporting UFO incidents in the area where the landing occurred as far back as November of 1989. The landing was videotaped without the knowl- edge of other witnesses to the event on August 18, 1991. We discovered the landing site and witnesses on May 10, 1992 and began an investigation based on con- tamination evidence suggesting an extraordinary event which affected the site. I have testimony from several experts in diversified scientific fields which strongly argues against human technological involvement in the event. The size of the craft was approximately 20-25 feet in diameter as determined by correlating field tests. The flares or pyrotechnic activity at the site have been de- termined to be of unknown origin, not compatible with any universally known compounds. The craft depicted in the video apparently left residue elements identified as not being indigenous to the site. Acoustics analysis of the video tape correlates with the geography and par- ticular topography of the investigated field site. A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) from a Digital Audio Tape (DAT) taken from an original Guardian-supplied copy of the video detailed no evidence of electrical fields, re- peating pulses or oscillations within the detection fre- quency range of the recording equipment used, yet all ambient sounds typical to the scenario depicted in the video, including the distant sounds of barking dogs, wind noise, insects, camera operator breathing and walk- ing, as well as camera equipment noise in close prox- imity to the microphone were all identifiable. No uniden- tified sound spikes could be attributed to the object or the pyrotechnics depicted in the video. NBC invested in excess of $115,000 unsuccessfully attempting to duplicate the effects in the Guardian video and concluded that to fake what was observed in the video would have taken a sizeable investment and would have been virtually impossible to pull off without the co- operation of the residents in the neighborhood, some of whom have agreed to polygraph examination in order to refute that possibility. Even NASA's JPL was unable to find evidence of hoaxing the event depicted in the video. After five research and investigation trips to Canada, the task is not yet complete. The final conclusions re- garding Guardian's various claims of alien operations will have to wait until the investigation evolves into a dia- logue with Guardian. The single most important question that remains to be answered is: \"How did Guardian know that the craft was going to land at that time and place?\" Local geography at the site negates the possibility that Guardian could have just stumbled onto the event, while the quality of camcorder used exceeds that which the average individual might carry around in his auto- mobile. My remaining efforts will be focused on estab- lishing a dialogue with Guardian. His decision to remain anonymous is, in my opinion, prudent. Removing pub- lic anonymity can only put the focus on his credibility and integrity instead of the incredible event itself. My ob- jective will be to encourage his cooperation.

Ritchie Benedict M any years ago in Scotland, there used to be a third verdict in legal cases. Besides guilty and not guilty, you had \"not proven.\" Another way of saying that for every definite yes or no, there is an equally definite maybe. This describes perfectly the UFO phenomena. In this book by two British UFO experts, there is an attempt to examine every salient issue—from outright hoaxing to extremely reliable evidence. They begin by examining how science-fiction has shaped our attitudes to the possibility of life beyond the stars. Sci-fi writer Bob Shaw makes the point that we are projecting our hopes and expectations upon any potential aliens. Such crea- tures may have their own agenda and be quite oblivi- ous to our wishes. Perhaps, this may be one of the rea- sons why accounts of abductions make us so thor- oughly uncomfortable: real aliens, as opposed to the fictional variety many people are so fascinated with, may not be quite so accommodating to our wishes (although not necessarily the complete horrors imag- ined by some, either). A hoax by a British physicist writing as David Langford now has a minor place in flying saucer lore. In a slim 96-page volume with the unwieldly title of \"Account of a Meeting With Denizens of Another World,\" Langford presents a fictional account of a man named William Loosley making alien contact way back in 1871. This story was even used by Whitley Strieber in his novel \"Majestic.\" Having laid the foundation, the authors next turn to the question of whether we are being visited by gen- uine aliens. There are chapters on SETI (The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence), the controversial contactee George Adamski, the purported sightings by U.S. astronauts, the Von Daniken~claims of visi- tors in prehistory, the 1991 landings in the U.S.S.R., the issue of Roswell and crashed spaceships, the Face on Mars, channelling and the psychic element, and finally the implications for humanity if final proof does come. The strongest evidence is also the oddest. A mes- sage of fluctuating tones received in Arizona on Valentine's Day 1976, bears no resemblance to human speech. An attempt to translate it into musical notation produced results that \"looked more like an expression- istic drawing than a piece of music.\" Two photographs of what appear to be aliens, one in 1964 and the other in 1987, are still unexplained despite attempts to rationalize them. The Templeton photo shows a white \"space-suited\" figure on a hillside behind the photographer's small daughter, Elizabeth. Jim Templeton noticed nothing when the photo was taken. Subsequently, he was visited by two men dressed in dark suits, driving an expensive Jaguar car and asking a lot of odd questions concerning weather and the be- havior of animals and birds. The second photo was taken by a retired police officer named Philip Spencer when he set out on the morning of December 1st, 1987, to walk across Ilkley Moor in Yorkshire. Intending to take a picture of the town, he instead captured a small creature that scuttled towards a bluff. Rounding a comer, Spencer was startled to see a hovering silver disc which shot up into the clouds. Spencer has refused any money for his claim and was reluctant to disclose his identity at first, finally consenting to the use of an assumed name, as he holds a senior management position with an American com- pany in Britain. If the \"creature\" was a four-foot-tall dummy, it would have taken a considerable amount of work to haul it into position on the moors. In the fall of 1986, the authors made contact with a man who called himself John. \"John\" had supposedly come into contact with some highly secret UFO files while in the British army. After an aborted meeting, Randies and Hough concluded the whole affair was just another red herring. However, eleven days later, the man arranged a second meeting, saying he'd had to cancel the first one for fear of exposure. A later check of the licence number of John's car proved that it was reg- istered in the month when he said he left the military. Although the story was undeniably interesting, no shred of material evidence was offered. It is more than possi- ble than the informant was a plant by the government in- tended to discredit the investigators. Such is the ambi- guity in the UFO field. One bizarre aspect of the 1991 landings in Voronezh, USSR, involved a curious symbol noted on the side of one of the UFOs. This symbol also appeared in Spain in 1965, as part of a proven hoax. Few in Russia could have known about this symbol as little UFO-oriented lit- erature leaked into the Soviet Union during the hard-line Brezhnev period. A study by American researcher Ray Boeche shows that most of us are not ready for contact with ETs. His survey revealed that fully 65% of the respondents believed alien contact would produce financial chaos, shattered religious beliefs and altered political alle- giances. In short, it might be best for all concerned if contact never occurs during our lifetimes. Of course, if there is life out there, sooner or later it is going to happen whether we like it or not.

Strong stuff and well worth reading! \"AREA 51\" VIEWER'S GUIDE BY GLENN CAMPBELL $15, SELF-PUBLISHED, ILLUS., APPROX. 85 PAGES Reviewed by Dennis Stacy T he computer, laser printer and personal copier have made writers and publishers out of a lot of people who might otherwise have spent their time (and ours) doing something constructive, like mowing the lawn. Happily, they also converge on rare occasion to produce a little gem like this one from Glenn Campbell, which could easily double as a how- to manual in self-publishing and amateur ufology. And of course, it helps if you can write as well as Campbell. Who would have thought that a guide book to viewing \"flying saucers\" (or at least nocturnal lights) in the Nevada desert would actually be entertaining as well as highly informative? Not me, for sure, even though Campbell claims he got the idea from my own similar but much more modest treatment of the west Texas Marfa Lights. If true, the pupil has far outstripped the \"master.\" Anyone even remotely contemplating a trip to the so- called Black Mailbox on Highway 375 near Rachel. Nevada, northeast of Groom Lake, Dreamland and Area 51 needs this viewer's guide, almost as much as they'll need a spare tire and a pair of binoculars. About the only thing Campbell doesn't do is pick you up at your front door and drop you off at the mailbox or the fabled Little Ale'Inn in person. Virtually all the information you'll need to plan and execute a UFO expedition is here in clear, practical detail, from the weather and what to wear, to what to say when the Sheriff pulls you over and asks just what the hell do you think you're doing out here in the middle of nowhere, anyway? (The safest course is to 'fess up and tell him you're looking for flying saucers, which puts you at least one rung up the ladder from would-be drug smugglers.) There is even a cheapskate's guide to Las Vegas, full of plums of data about where to stay and eat on the average ufologist's tight budget. Naturally, Campbell provides an overall background briefing into the secret saucer lore surrounding Area-51 as a whole, including Bob Lazar's claims of having seen nine alien aircraft at nearby Papoose Lake, all of it balanced both by good common sense and a sense of hu- mor almost as sere as the surrounding landscape. The heart of the book is a mile-by-mile log of what to expect along the 100 miles of Highway 375 between the Las Vegas turn-off on US 93 and Warm Springs on US 6, as informative about where not to go as it is about where to go. Campbell also describes what you can expect to see by day and night, from the so-called \"golden globes\" (most probably military flares) to red dots and maybe the near-mythical Aurora. Some maps are included, along with specifics about how to purchase government topo- graphic maps and even satellite images of the immediate area. The author even provides a ready-to-use order form for U. S. Geological Survey maps! Saucer hunting doesn't get much easier than this. But even if you don't plan on going to Nevada in person, you should still pick up a copy of this viewer's guide and enjoy it from the safety and comfort of your very own armchair. This is amateur (or is it professional?) ufology at its finest. And anyone seriously contemplat- ing self-publishing their own manuscript owes it to themselves and their readers to see how it's done. Kudos all around, Mr. Campbell. For ordering information, see the Readers' Classified section in this issue. JUST CAUSE It doesn't say on the masthead, but I believe this typically eight-page newsletter is published four times a year by CAUS, Citizens Against UFO Secrecy, Box 218, Conventry, CT 06238. At any rate, annual subscrip- tions are $15 US and $20 foreign. Publisher Larry Fawcett and editor Barry Greenwood are of course the authors of Clear Intent, a document-heavy criticism of government UFO cover-up, and for the most part that emphasis on documentation extends to the newsletter. The current issue, No. 34, Dec. 1992, has articles on FOIA \"dirty tricks\" and the involvement of the late Dr. Anthony Mirarchi with Project Twinkle, an early 50's ef- fort by the Air Force to investigate the so-called \"Green Fireballs\" that plagued the American Southwest a few years earlier, and some caustic commentary of the \"Roswell\" testimony of one Gerald Anderson. At least two recent issues dealt in detail with FOIA documents and other historical papers treating with the \"Foo Fighter\" phenomenon at the end of WW II. Recommended for anyone who wants to keep track of the UFO paper trail - and an open-mind as to the nature of the phenomenon itself.

Unless noted, no sound, vibration or odor was detected. All times are local. Prepared by Donald Ware (E) Eastern Regional Director and George Coyne (C) Central Region Director. • Log #910705E: On June 30, 1990, at 7:00 p.m., a 23- year-old office worker, his sister and grandmother ob- served a pyramid-shaped UFO for 20 minutes near Wilmington, DE: investigator, Hugh B. Horning. A black cylindrical protrusion extended vertically from the horizontal triangular base. The sides were yellow, bordered in orange with a small orange triangle in the center of each. When closest, the object appeared the size of a dime at arm's length and was thought to be larger than a standard car. From the grandmother's 14th floor balcony on Pennsylvania Avenue, they watched it spin clockwise as it ascended in a straight line, from about 300 feet above the ground in the NE, until it went out of sight at 25° elevation in the north. • Log #930201E: In August 1992, at 12:30 a.m., an electronic/computer technician saw an oval object about 50 feet long with a red light above and below, strobing, one then the other, near Havelock, NC; investigator. John W. Patterson. An intense,-\"concentrated\" horizon- tal slab of light, about 22'x20'xl', was immediately be- low the object. It crossed about 200 feet over Lake Road, heading east and appeared to land behind the trees near a lake about 150 feet from the road. It made a roaring sound \"like blowing in a bottle.\" He went to his home about l/8th of a mile away; as he called his friend in the neighborhood, it came up and headed south. Both heard the noise this time. At 2:30 a.m. that night his friend saw the object two blocks away from his house for about five minutes. It did not have the intense slab of white light below it, but he saw three rectangular white lighted areas centered along the side of the oval. No landing traces were found. • Log # 930202E: On 4 December, 1992, at 8:05 a.m., a 28-year-old waitress and her 7-year-old daughter saw a dark gray, circular UFO with a hump on the top, four round protrusions on the bottom, and red and white lights on the edge in Winston Salem, NC; investigator, Barbara W. Thompson. The mother looked out the back window to watch her daughter walk to the next street on her way to the bus stop when she saw the UFO 10 feet above the ground, just beyond the nearest houses on the next street. It made a humming sound. She was filled with \"wonderment\" as it went up and hovered a few inches above the neighbor's house. Then she became hysterical when she saw her daughter standing near it, looking up. By the time she got outside, the object was gone and so was her daughter. The mother ran through the yard screaming for her about six times, with no an- swer. The next time she called, from behind her, the daughter said, \"What, momma?\" in a normal voice. She was not frightened at all. When the daughter asked what she wanted, she was told to go on to the bus stop. After school, the daughter described seeing what her mother saw, but she also saw purple lights. Eleven days later, the mother and older daughter saw a different, silent UFO. • Log #930301E: January 21, 1993, at 5:30 p.m., a 47- year-old part-time secretary and her son observed a UFO emit highly strange balls of yellow light for 30 min- utes in Shalimar, FL; investigator, Robert F. Mosley. The object looked like a helicopter with no rotor. The craft ap- peared the size of a dime at arm's length, and it moved slowly west. A bright yellow ball of light, larger than the object, came out of the back and then exploded into four identical balls in a diamond pattern. They lasted 2 or 3. seconds before fading out. The mother and son followed it in the car, and it repeated this performance two more times. The last time they were closer. The ob- ject was 200 to 300 feet above the water tower, and the balls appeared the size of a half-dollar at arm's length. An Eglin AFB spokesman denied any flare use in the area. • Log #021293C: January 27, 1993, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, incident investigated by Lori Theis. In a suburban area near NW Expressway and Council Road, on the morning of January 27, at 12:37 a.m., a man stepped onto his third-story balcony to retrieve his cat when he discovered what he said \"sent a cold shiver through my body.\" Directly across the street to the west, was a light in the shape of a crescent or \"half frisbee,\" that was 150 to 200 feet in length. It was gliding silently over the Harvest Hills housing project, lighting up roof tops as it moved along. The huge yellow-orange light was within 500 feet of the witness at an altitude of ap- proximately 180 feet. The light/object was moving away from him in a due west path at a speed of 20-30 miles per hour. It never changed altitude, speed or direction, until it was 3 to 4 blocks away, at which point it disap- peared \"like a light being turned off. \" • Log #021193C: Lake LeAnn, Jerome, MI, Hillsdale County, December 15, 1992; Investigator Shirley Coyne. At 5:20 p.m. an elderly lady was watching television in her living room when her attention was drawn to a pair of bright \"headlights\" in the sky. She thought it was an airplane but knew that planes were not supposed to fly so low. The object was flying toward her house, which sits on a hill overlooking the lake. She noticed that it was just a little bit higher than the tops of trees in the area. \"It wasn't in any hurry, it moved really slow and was mak- ing this vibrating humming sound, not even an engine or APRIL 1993 NUMBER 300 PAGE 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL plane sound.\" As the object approached and passed over her at an altitude of 75 feet, she was able to see two rows of windows, one located above the headlights, the other located below the headlights. She said \"The row of windows above the headlights were dimly lit but the bottom row was dark.\" The object appeared very strange to the witness. It looked like two inverted plates with a square box sandwiched in the center of them. It was a dull, grayish-black color. She lost sight of the object when it flew over her house, going to the northeast. A man who lives in the neighborhood also witnessed the event. Lake LeAnn is located on Baker Readjust off Highway US 12. • Log #010893C: Lansing, MI, August 10, 1992, 8:26 p.m. Investigator, Rex Schrader, aided by Jim Lieb and Ron Wilson. At 8:11 p.m. two young mothers and four children entered the Meijer Store on S. Pennsylvania Avenue in Lansing. They went directly to the video center, made their purchase and left the store at 8:26 pm. They were walking in the parking lot, heading for their car, when one of the women noticed that a strange object was flying over the southeast area of the parking lot. The object was solid black and had a dull finish. It was as large as her car, with two large spheres at the top, each attached at an angle on either side. The main base ap- peared to be round, about 30 feet in diameter, with an oblong black shape descending from its center. When first observed, the object was at an altitude of 8-900 feet and rapidly ascended to 1400 feet in four seconds. The object quickly changed its heading without a turning ra- dius. The witnesses' got into the car and followed the object driving east on Hwy IH-96, south on US-27, north on Cedar, keeping the object in sight for 18 min- utes. During this chase the CB radio would not transmit. It was okay after the sighting. The primary witness said that the object looked \"like a pair of Mickey Mouse ears attached to a smaller skullcap.\" She knows all about aircraft, being an aiiframe/powerplant mechanic. • Log #011493C: 5:30 a.m., December 21, 1991, Stockbridge, MI, Jackson County. Investigator, Michael Talbot, Parma, MI. Mr.\"S\" went outdoors to warm up his car before leaving for work. He noticed a bright starlike object to the southwest moving erratically, up and down, back and forth. It was also changing colors as it moved. It was larger than the stars in the same area. He went inside and woke his wife. She got out of bed and watched from the living room picture window on the south side of the house. Mr. \"S\" left for work at 5:45 a.m., but Mrs. \"S\" continued to watch. The object began to move in an easterly direction at a slow constant rate of speed until it went out of her view. She remained in the living room for several more minutes before she ob- served the object traveling back from east to west. She noticed that when it was to the southwest of her that it appeared to move to the north, until it was once again out of her view. She went to her young son's bedroom, which is at the west end of the house. She could see that the object was due west of her home and now much closer. After watching for several minutes she decided to take some pictures with a video camera. It was now 6:25, and she focused on the object for 3 minutes and 47 seconds. One of her small children began to cry, so she turned the camera off and went to attend him. When she went back a while later the object was gone. • Log #013193C: October 1973, Gulfport, MS, Harrison County. Investigator, J.R. Gillis of Gulfport. A woman was driving west on Highway U.S. 90, returning home from work, when she looked to her left and saw an object hovering out over the Gulf. She drove into a parking bay so that she could observe the object better. It appeared to be about 500 feet above the water, and she thought it may have been about 6 miles out. The object was disk-shaped with a dome on top. The dome ap- peared to be 8 feet high. There were red, yellow and white lights around the craft that were blinking on and off. She said that it was about the same size as the moon. Time of sighting was 8 o'clock in the evening. She did not tell anyone about the sighting because she did not want people to think she was crazy. The witness does not remember if the sighting was before or after the Pascagoula, MS case which occurred on October 11, 1973, to Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker. • Log #013093C: 1976, Cobb County, near the town of Smyrna, Georgia, investigated by J.R. Gillis. A young woman reported that when she was six years old, she had gotten out of bed about 2:00 a.m. and went to the kitchen for a drink of water or coke. She looked out of the big picture window and saw a large cigar-shaped craft hovering just above the ground, not more than 30 yards from the house. It appeared to be larger than a house and it had lights all along the side of it. The lights were very white. She believes that she watched the ob- ject for 10-15 minutes. The next thing she recalled was waking up in the morning and going to school. She talked to a boy at school who claimed to have seen the same thing in his neighborhood. She did not wake her parents, nor did she tell them about the sighting. She has been living near Gulfport,. MS for the .past five_years. She contacted the Mississippi State Director, Jim Scarborough, after seeing him on a TV program. • Log #930303E: September 30, 1992, at 10:30 p.m. an 81-year-old woman observed strange white lights 100 feet from her bedroom window near the Katahdin Iron Works, ME; investigator, Arnold Dunning. The center light was steady, and it appeared twice the size of the moon. It had about a dozen dimmer white lights in an eight-foot circle around it that blinked on and off. They were just above eye level, between the witness and a tree. After 15 minutes they blinked off.

This was more than amply demonstrated by the circle-making contest held at West Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, the night of 11-12 July, sponsored by The Cereologist, the Centre for Crop Circle Studies and others, which awarded three cash prizes based on performance. I suggest that a similar contest be held in England again this spring or summer, along with similar compe- titions in the United States and Canada. But to up the ante, so to speak, I propose that the contest be held this time in crops of oilseed rape (canola) so as to separate the men from the boys. Unlike wheat, oats, rye and barley, which have proved more malleable or \"work- able\" than most cereologists first suspected, rape is an extremely delicate and brittle plant in that it consists mainly of a hollow stalk with semi-rigid walls. I submit that no human can convincingly flatten rape in circular spirals without obviously snapping the stems. If the contests prove this out, then at least those circles re- ported in rape (admittedly fewer in number and simpler in formation than most crop circles) would have to be considered authentic in lieu of contrary evidence. This would also suggest that at least some of the circles ap- pearing in the main cereal crops can be considered gen- uine. In other words, it would help define and delimit what humans can and can't do in terms of imitating the crop circle phenomenon.

Last night, February 24th, I attended a preview screen- ing of \"Fire In the Sky,\" based on the Travis Walton ex- perience. Several other members of MUFON, as well as investigators and abductees were also present. We were appalled by some of the fictional elements in the story. First, the portrayal of a UFO investigator from the fic- tional UFO organization A.F.A.R. left our audience with a negative impression of UFO investigators. The character in the movie is portrayed as one who barges in on a hot abduction scene and bullies his way into an in- terview with the tired, haggard and distraught Travis Walton. This does nothing but reinforce a negative im- age of field investigators. Second, the abduction episode itself was a radical departure from Walton's recounting of it in his book. Bizarre elements, evidently meant to be loaded with o \"horror\" and \"fear\" characterized the entire abduction episode. While the original story depicted Walton's ini- tial fear of the little white-skinned, fetal-looking crea- tures who captured him, other details, such as his expe- rience in the navigator chair, were absolutely fascinating and engaging enough for any motion picture audi- ence.Those who read the book may not think the movie was based on a true story. The negative images may arouse fear and doubts in the viewing public. The movie is not without its redeeming elements as the drama plays out with Mike Rogers and crew. However, it is Mike Rogers that takes center stage, and not Travis. Let us hope that future films on the subject of UFO ab- ductions are done with better faith. Television's \"Intruders\" was far more faithful to the reality of events. The movie \"Communion\" was a disaster, and hopes were riding high on \"Fire in the Sky,\" but they were dashed when the lights came on in the screening room. Ann Druffel leaned over to me and said, \"Bill, what have they done to this story?\" That was a question I could not answer. —Bill Hamilton MUFON LA Dir. of Investigations \"MISSING\" EMBRYOS/FETUSES In recent years numerous female abductees have re- lated that alien humanoids have intervened in the re- moval of an existing pregnancy, or have inseminated fe- males either directly or artificially: the so-called missing embryo/fetus syndrome. However, my research has yet to reveal one documented or verified case that would in- dicate such events are occurring. In putting out this memo to UFO researchers and in- vestigators alike, as well as to female abductees, I would like for them to submit the following information: Doctor's verification of pregnancy, medical records with ultrasound scan, D & C's etc., to document that this has occurred. All information will be reviewed by a Blue Ribbon Panel Committee. I am offering $500 to any case that shows without a reasonable doubt that a female ab- ductee has had a missing pregnancy.

UNITED NATIONS VIDEO On October 2, L992, a UFO presentation was made to the Parapsychology Society and interested UN of- ficials in the Dag Hammarskjold Auditorium at the United Nations in New York City to reopen Decision GA33/426 previously enacted by the General Assembly on December 18, 1978. MUFON has pro- duced a video tape depicting the most significant as- pects of this important meeting. The two-hour VHS video tape is composed of the opening and closing remarks of Mohammad A. Ramadan (Egypt), \"The Cosmic Watergate: Basic Facts\" by Stanton T. Friedman, M.S., \"Medical and Scientific Evidence\" by John F. Schuessler, M.S., and \"An Open Letter to the Secretary-General and the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space\" by Robert H. Bletchman, J.D. The latter three speakers are all members of MUFON's Board of Directors. MUFON has initially ordered 500 copies of this monumental UN presentation to be made available im- mediately.

The red planet passes through the edge of the Beehive cluster on the 11th and 12th. Use optical aid to view the planet in the field of this beautiful wedge-shaped cluster. Jupiter (-2.3), in Virgo, is in the SSE at dusk and moves westward during the night. • (Morning Sky): Venus rises about 3:30 a.m. daylight time in mid- May and is low in the E at dawn. Our neighbor world achieves greatest brilliancy on the 7th at mag- nitude -4.5, although it is almost as bright through- out the month. Mars sets in the NW soon after 1 a.m. in midmonth. Jupiter advances across the southern heavens, setting in the W about 3:30 a.m. in mid-May. Saturn (0.9), in Aquarius, rises about 2 a.m. in mid- month and lies low in the SE at dawn. • Partial Solar Eclipse: The Moon hides part of the Sun after sunrise on May 21 for those of us in the central and western states and Alaska. The southern limit for this eclipse falls along a curve extending through W and N Texas, southern Oklahoma, NW Arkansas, SE Missouri, southern Illinois and NW Ohio. Local starting times and max- imum percentages of the Sun's diameter covered for selected cities: Seattle, 5:26 a.m., 41%; San Francisco (in progress at sunrise), 26.5%; Salt Lake City, 6:19, 24%; Denver, 6:20, 17%; Chicago, 7:34, 6%.

For safety, project the Sun's image through a pinhole. in a card (or through a tele- scope eye-piece) onto a white surface. • Meteor Shower: The full moon hampers viewing of the May Aquarids on the morning of the 4th. Nevertheless, an observer might see occasional bright yellow meteors streaking swiftly out of Aquarius in the E in the predawn sky. • Moon Phases: Full moon — May 5 Last quarter — May 13 New Moon — May 21 First quarter — May 28 • The Stars: After evening twilight fades, let the Big Dipper guide you to the prominent stars and patterns of the season. This saucepan of 7 stars is now inverted high in the N. The two western stars of the dipper's bowl point to Polaris the North Star; the two eastern bowl stars point to Regulus, the heart of Leo the Lion; and the bent handle, if extended, curves to bright orange Arcturus in kite-shaped Bootes and then continues an equal distance to bluish-white Spica in Virgo.

APRIL 1993 NUMBER 300 PAGE 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL MESSAGE - Continued from Page 23 a second term. His wife, Shirley, has confirmed this diagnosis of his overall health. A second candidate has allowed his name to be submitted for nomination. He is Walter L. \"Barney\" Garner, Jr. (Baton Rouge), Louisiana State Director. Mr. Garner retired from the USAF in 1972 as a Lt. Colonel and from the faculty of Louisiana State University in 1988. Since becoming State Director in 1989, Barney has organized the state investigative team through Parish State Section Directors and three geographically located Assistant State Directors. He publishes a very professional state newsletter. A third candidate has been nominated by Jean Waller-Seifried, Oklahoma State Director. She is Jean E. Byrne, B.S. and R.N., living in Norman, Oklahoma. Jean will receive her Masters in Human Relations in May 1993 and is enrolled in graduate work toward state licensure as a Licensed Professional Therapist. Mrs. Byrne has been involved in Ufology since 1987 as a consulting hypnotherapist and co-investigator. She was a speaker at the Ozark UFO Conference in 1992 and presented two papers at the prestigious UFO Abduction Study Conference held at M.I.T., also in 1992. She is participating in the MUFON abduction transcription project headed by Dan Wright and John Carpenter. After 20 years of management in the nursing field, Jean would like to apply the aforementioned skills toward making cre- ative changes in the cohesiveness of MUFON as the Central Regional Director. The fourth candidate, William E. \"Bill\" Jones, J.D. (Columbus) has withdrawn his name from the election due to his recent promotion to Ohio State Director, which will require his maximum attention and effort. He offers his support to George Coyne. Due to the inconvenience and poor appearance of a ballot stapled within each Journal mailed to every mem- ber in the central region of states and a postage savings to members, a new procedure will be initiated on an ex- perimental basis for this election. It will also have an- other advantage where family subscriptions are involved and only one ballot was previously enclosed. To make this election both legal and convenient the following steps have been taken. For individual members please mail a 19-cent postcard specifying your vote for Jean E. Byrne, George R. Coyne or Walter L. Gamer for Central Regional Director. Sign your name, date and mail to MUFON in Seguin, Texas, before May 31, 1993. If a family membership exists, the same procedure applies except that each must sign their own name on the same postcard for convenience sake. If they vote for different people this must be clearly indicated. We feel that this revised procedure is superior to inserting a ballot or the necessity for cutting a printed ballot out of the Journal, thus damaging your copy and using valuable space. Due to MUFON's growth, we must streamline our procedures for effectiveness. Please vote now while it is fresh in your memory. If successful, a similar pro- cedure may be adopted for MUFON's annual award. EXPLORING UNEXPLAINED PHENOMENA CONFER- ENCE The Fortean Research Center is presenting its fifth conference on the unexplained April 30 to May 2, 1993, at the Nebraska Center for Continuing Education at 33rd and Holdredge Streets, Lincoln, NE 68583-0901.

Salter, Kevin Randle, Stanton Friedman, Harry Jordan, Dr. John Kasher, Linda Moulton Howe, Budd Hopkins, Rosemary Ellen Guiley, John S. Carpenter and Raymond Boeche. Registration is $45 for the conference speaking schedule. A block of rooms has been reserved at the Nebraska Center Hotel which adjoins the conference site. Please make your room reservations directly with the hotel by calling (402) 472-3435. For further infor- mation call Scott Colborn at (402) 421-1701 from 1 to 7 p.m. CST. EARL NEFF Cleveland's \"Dean of Ufology\" and veteran ufolo- gist, Earl Neff, 90, died March 12, 1993, after suffer- ing a brain hemorrhage two years ago. Throughout his ufological career, he founded the Cleveland Ufology Project in 1958 and was a member of NICAP, APRO and MUFON. At the MUFON 1974 UFO Symposium in Akron, Ohio, Earl entertained the banquet attendees with a humorous after-dinner speech. Mary Ann Hawk, the current director of CUP, has shared Mr. Neff's obituary with Journal readers.

Please promptly submit the name of your candidate, since this is a personal thank you and a vote of appreciation for their accomplishments in advancing the study of the new science of ufology. OPERATION RIGHT TO KNOW To clarify any misunderstanding, the Mutual UFO Network, as an organization, does not approve or sup- port the planned demonstration in front of the White House in Washington, DC, scheduled for July 5, 1993, by a group known as \"Operation Right to Know.\" Even though some of the demonstrators may also be MUFON members, this in no way implies endorse- ment of their march. MUFON feels that there are more expedient and effective methods of lobbying our congressional representatives about the necessity for disclosure of UFO information than public demon- strations. However, we do support the work being done and current proposals by the Fund for UFO Research in their \"behind the scenes\" approach being made directly with members of the U.S. Congress. MUFON 1993 SYMPOSIUM The theme for the MUFON 1993 International UFO Symposium is \"UFOLOGY: The Emergence of a New Science.\" Hosted by MUFON Virginia, the conference will take place the weekend of July 2, 3 and 4, 1993, at the Hyatt Richmond Hotel, 6624 West Broad Street, Richmond, Virginia 23230.

The latter, first published in September of 1967, began as a small mimeographed newsletter edited by the late Mrs. Norma A. Short. Today, the Journal has grown into a 24-page magazine with glossy covers and a profes- sional format. Now edited by Dennis Stacy, it is dis- tributed to 4.500 subscribers worldwide. Obviously, we are very proud of the progress made in the intervening years. Editor Emeritus recognition and appreciation is hereby extended to past editors Dwignt Connelly, Dennis William Hauck, Richard H. Hall and Robert \"Bob\" Pratt, all of whom volun- teered their services at one time or another. Walt Andrus has served as interim editor on several occa- sions and as associate editor for many years. This is a remarkable achievement in a field where organizations and newsletters come and go. In fact, no other UFO magazine has approached even one-half of the 30U consecutive monthly issues published by the MUFON UFO Journal and Skylook. We owe a debt of gratitude to the hundreds of people who have con- tributed articles to the Journal over the past 25 years, and especially to our loyal readers during that time. It has been an honor to have the Journal, our official publication, represent the Mutual UFO Network, the world's largest UFO investigative organization. The revised name on the cover further exemplifies and identifies this relationship. NEW OFFICERS \"Jeff\" Ballard, Alabama State Director has appointed Duncan R. Crow, J.D. (Semmes) to the position of Assistant State Director for southern Alabama. Duncan is a former state section director. Ohio State director, William E. \"Bill\" Jones, J.D.
