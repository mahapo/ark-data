Although this mission statement may sound simple, it is full of meaning and as an active member of MUFON you should take the time to reflect on what that simple statement means to you. For me personally, it all hinges on the phrase “for the benefit of hu- manity”, that is I hope that when all is said and done, pursuing the truth be- hind the mystery of UFOs will lead to breakthrough discoveries that will im- prove the plight of human civilization. The next logical question I am then asked is what benefits would accrue to humanity by solving the UFO mystery? Since UFOs behavior appears to rep- resent advanced travel technology, so- ciety could be revolutionized if that same technology became widely avail- able and replaced traditional fossil fuel based modes of transport. If UFO technology for example, were to be incorporated in the family auto- mobile, I could travel to Paris over my lunch hour and take a walk on the Great Wall of China after dinner. Sound crazy? Yes it does, but if you could have told Copernicus that one day humans would set foot on the moon, despite his re- nown open mindedness, he may have still thought you quite out there on the lunatic fringe. This leads us to the final question - whose technology is it? Trying to an- swer this question has landed more than one ufologist in hot water with both the scientific and ufological communities. After all, we are only human and equally capable of being biased in our beliefs and perceptions. Is it secret human tech- nology hidden from the public by power groups?

Paul spent an enormous amount of time traveling and re- searching this case and his NICAP/MUFON case file on the Cisco Grove Bow and Arrow case is about the thickness of a New York City telephone book. Donald Shrum spoke publicly for the first time at a 2005 MUFON chapter meeting in San Jose, California on his 1964 Cisco Grove encounter with alien beings in what has also become known as the “Bow and Arrow” case. Preston Dennett, author of UFOs over Topanga Canyon , and UFOs Over California refers to Shrum as “Donald Smythe” in his book’s account of the Cisco Grove case. This Journal story is the first published article I know of that uses their real names. The Shrum family gave up their anonymity after 41 years so that the accurate story could be told. Donald Shrum attended the meeting with his wife Judy Shrum and MUFON investigator Ms. Kathlyn Bunyard. Mr. Shrum seemed in good health for 67 years old, but he still appeared uncom- fortable relating his experience. Shrum corrected some errors that had been previously reported. In some accounts, he supposedly climbed into the tree because he was frightened. (See Case Study) This was not true. Shrum had become separated from his hunt- ing party and it is a common practice not to search after dark for your base camp, but instead climb into a high tree and wait till first light, in order to be safe from animal predators. At one point during the night, Shrum threw his water canteen at the aliens at the base of the tree. The aliens picked up the canteen, quickly examined it, and then dropped it on the ground. Trying everything he could to avoid being cap- tured, he also threw coins at the being. Although not interested in the canteen, the beings quickly snapped up and kept the coins. Continued on page 4 Shrum had an ample supply of matches in his pocket, and he spent all night tossing down burning scraps of paper and torn up pieces of cloth from his jacket. Finally he broke off pine branches, lit them on fire and tossed them down. (The photo of the tree shows that the top branches are miss- ing.) The aliens were definitely afraid of fire, Shrum said. Each time the aliens approached the tree in the pitch black darkness, Shrum would shake the tree, and each time the aliens would retreat 25 yards. Shrum could see other aliens gathering some- thing, perhaps plant samples from the surrounding area. The aliens wore strange tight-fitting garments with hoods - their eyes were large and black, but their noses were difficult to see and appeared small and low in relation to the eyes. The robot looked metallic, and judging from the illustrations had bright orange eyes and what I would describe as “Gort-like” jaw facial features. (I use the term “Gort- like,” because Paul Cerny’s superb color illustrations remind me of the facial structure of the robot from the 1951 movie The Day the Earth Stood Still! ) The beings were not taller than 5 feet and the robots slightly shorter. Near the end of this siege, another robot appeared and both robots moved near to the tree. Strange sparks were exchanged between the robots as they closely faced each other. They began emitting a larger volume of mysterious gas, causing Shrum to pass out for an undetermined length of time but his belt tied around the tree trunk prevented him from falling. By the time Shrum awoke the aliens had already departed. At sunrise he climbed down from the tree and re- turned to the base camp where he met up with his two friends. One of Shrum’s companions had noticed very"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" April 2007 4 MUFON UFO Journal September 4, 1964* Synopsis by Richard Hall Donald Shrum, 28,** and his friends were bow and arrow hunting in an isolated area of Placer County, California, and Shrum had become separated from his companions. At sunset he decided to sleep in a tree for the night. Later he saw a white light zigzagging at low altitude and, thinking it was a helicopter, he jumped out of the tree and lit fires to attract its attention. The light turned toward him and stopped about 50–60 yards away. The object’s strange appearance frightened Shrum, so he climbed back up into the tree.*** After a while two humanoid beings and a robot-like creature approached the tree. From then on, Shrum was in a state of siege as the beings tried to dislodge him from the tree. At one point a white vapor emanated from the robot’s mouth and Shrum blacked out, but woke up again nauseous. He began lighting matches and throwing them down to frighten the beings away and they backed away. Finally he shot an arrow at the robot. When it hit there was an arc flash and the robot was knocked back- wards. This was repeated twice more, and the humanoids scattered each time. A second robot then appeared and a vapor again rendered Shrum unconscious. When he awoke, he discovered that the two humanoids were climbing up the tree toward him, so he shook the tree and threw things down at them to ward them off. The same actions were repeated all night. Near dawn more beings approached. “Large volumes of smoke” drifted up and he blacked out. He awoke, secured to the tree by his belt and the creatures were gone. Later when reunited with his companions, Shrum found that one of the other hunters—who also had gotten lost and separated from their camp—had also seen the UFO.

Case Directory: Cisco Grove, California Donald Shrum holding the 60 lb. bow and canteen used the night of his experience, September 11, 1964. odd lights during the night and had in- dependently interpreted those lights as a UFO. The length of time Shrum was in the tree is not exactly known but he estimated he was there from just after midnight until dawn. I asked Shrum if the gas emitted by the first robot had any particular odor or smell. He said he could see the gas, but it was odorless and just one whiff would cause him to suddenly start gasp- ing for air. At one point he thought of committing suicide—one side of the lone tree overhung a cliff—but the desire to see his 19-year-old wife and their 1-year- old daughter again kept him from do- ing so. Shrum said he had never be- lieved in UFOs before that night. Artifacts of the siege Donald and Judy Shrum displayed the 60 lb. bow and the water canteen used that night. The canteen was typi- cal Army WWII surplus in a cloth pouch with belt hook. Shrum had re- paired the metal canteen after it had punctured striking a rock and a metal patch could be seen on the side. Shrum also displayed an arrowhead similar to those used the night of the encounter. Shrum had three arrows with him that night and shot two of them at the aliens. One of the arrowheads struck the robot’s chest area from a range of 8 feet (the force of a rifle shot at point blank range), knocking the robot on its proverbial “metal ass.” The aliens did not attempt to fire back in return as they did not appear to be carrying any sort of weapon. Four weeks after the encounter, Shrum returned to the encounter scene with his younger brother Bill and friends Bill McAdams and Vince Alvarez. Vince Alverez (now deceased) had been one of Shrum’s hunting buddies that fateful night. They noticed that the site had been meticulously picked clean and there were rake marks everywhere on the ground. Cigarette butts and a single cigar butt were scattered about. Shrum took photographs of the site and the original prints are dated October 1964. Shrum was able at this time to retrieve the two arrows he shot. Bill Shrum confirmed the visit and the people present. He said that the scene was exactly as Don had de- scribed: burned spots (from the burn- ing tree branches thrown down), ciga- rette butts and discarded cigarette packs along with a cigar butt. Shrum stated that one arrow tip was turned over to a U.S. Air Force Cap- tain and a Sergeant at a 1964 McClellan Air Force Base interview. A September 9, 1968 U.S. Air Force letter to Ted Bloecher (NICAP) stated that the Air Force had not conducted any labora- tory analysis on the arrowhead and this arrowhead is still likely in the posses- sion of the U.S. Air Force. The Bow and Arrow Encounter Continued from page 3"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"      5 MUFON UFO Journal April 2007 The second arrow tip that struck the alien robot was handed over to Paul Cerny, chief investigator on the case (at that time he was with NICAP but later joined MUFON). This arrow tip was sent to a metallurgist for laboratory analysis and was part of the Condon Report’s physical evidence cases. Later this arrowhead became the property of Dr. Allen Hynek and after Dr. Hynek passed away, the arrow tip (which the Shrums insist still belongs to them) was donated to Arizona State University. The third arrow tip remained in Shrum’s possession for years, but was lost, possibly while moving. Investigation of the event In 1964 Judy Shrum’s mother con- tacted Professor Killick, Professor of Astronomy at Sacramento State Univer- sity. The Shrum family—Don, Judy, Judy’s mother, and Don’s younger brother—met with Professor Killick at his Sacramento home. The MUFON file on this case includes Professor Killick’s written report of this initial interview. Shortly after the Shrum interview, Pro- fessor Killick contacted the U.S. Air Force. Only Don and Judy were interviewed by the Air Force, and the declassified Blue Book documents detail that they were interviewed by a Captain McCloud, USAF, and a Sergeant Ma- jor R. Barnes. At this interview, Shrum gave Captain McCloud and Sergeant Major Barnes an exact detailed map of the area where the incident took place. After-effects of the encounter Judy Shrum said that Don had ter- rible nightmares for many years and suffered from what we now call post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). He never went deer hunting again. Several times he was frightened by an unusual “buzzing” in his ear and be- lieved the aliens were after him once again. Extensive hypnosis sessions re- assured Shrum that he had not been abducted and that he had never had an implant. Judy Shrum, in a November 1973 let- ter to Paul Cerny related an experience that happened that year during a camp- ing trip: “We were sitting around our campfire around 8 or 9 PM with our backs to a ridge of mountains when we noticed Don had gotten quiet and had turned around and was looking behind him at this ridge. We didn’t know until later that his ears had started “buzzing.” Anyway, this big light came high over the ridge pretty fast and was followed a few seconds later by a smaller light in the exact di- rection and path of the first one. These two lights seemed to be very high and traveling pretty fast. It was strange be- cause Don had turned around and was looking at the ridge before those lights came over. It was his reaction to those lights that scared me. After those lights disappeared we sat around and talked about it. “After we went to bed I noticed Don had gotten his gun, checked to make sure it was loaded and slept with the gun beside him. Sometime during the night something was walking around our tent. Also a deer ran into our tent later that night. It scared us so, that the next morning we ate breakfast, packed up and came home.” Re-telling the story In an episode of the 1977-78 NBC TV program Project Blue Book (pro- duced by Jack Webb) the Cisco Grove story was re-enacted without the Shrum’s permission or involvement. Judy stated that “the story was done poorly. Of course names were not used and things were changed in the story, probably to avoid a lawsuit. Every time this is done in books or articles by UFO researchers they change Don’s experi- ence which makes it appear as if he is the liar when in actuality the writer is covering their own butt at his expense. I know this sounds harsh but it has been our experience. Paul Cerny and Rich- ard Hall did the best and closest-to-the- truth story.” The Shrums never met Cerny or Hall in person. Another aspect of this case is how it relates to UFO/Alien encounters re- ported after 1964. I wondered that if the alien motive in this case was abduc- tion, why did this one apparently fail? Is there a “learning curve” for alien ab- ductors?

The Bow and Arrow Encounter Continued from page 5 Meeting of the Minds From March 10 – 12, 2007 a panel of ufologists and academics met in Fort Collins, Colorado in a “Meeting of the Minds” to discuss how to stimulate in- tellectual curiosity in the scientific com- munity on the subject of UFOs. MUFON was well rep- resented by Board Mem- bers John Schuessler, Robert Wood, Jan Harzan, Clifford Clift, and James Carrion. Stanton Friedman, Bruce Maccabee and Rich- ard Dolan, and Paul Sperry were also present. Al Harrison, Professor of Psychology at University of California Davis at- tended as an interested observer. The panel has become known as the “Armstrong Panel”, named after the the historic Armstrong Hotel in old town Fort Collins where the workshop was held. The results of that workshop will be published in a future proceedings pa- per. Currently a call to action letter is being drafted and will be distributed to the scientific community. Workshop Discussions MUFON has been investigating and studying the mystery of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) for 38 years, taking over where the U.S. Air Force left off when it terminated Project Blue Book in 1970. The hypothesis that these strange ob- jects represent a visiting non-human in- telligence is called the Extraterrestrial Hypothesis or ETH. Unfortunately, ETH has not been explored by the sci- entific community because it is not sub- ject to the tenet of hypothesis falsifi- ability, which states that a hypothesis that cannot be disproved is not consid- ered a viable hypothesis. A hypothesis that can be explored is the Human Manufacture hypothesis or HM. The HM hypothesis states that those objects of apparent technologi- cal manufacture that cannot be prosai- cally explained are being manufactured by one or more world governments or by covert elements thereof. These power groups are testing these objects in public airspace, and are not publicly disclosed because they are be- ing kept in strategic reserve for national security reasons. These power groups conveniently use the popular media and cul- tural view that UFOs are extraterrestrial craft as cover for these co- vert projects. That the U.S. Government has been implicated in this practice is a matter of national record. HM however cannot explain all of the UFO cases that MUFON has investigated, many of which fall in a category deemed “highly strange”. These are cases where the observed objects temporarily immo- bilize witness vehicles and even the wit- nesses themselves (temporary paraly- sis), emit rays of light that abruptly end in the atmosphere, or bend light rays around objects. In the same highly strange category, non-human occupants emerge from these objects and some- times interact with witnesses (sometimes using telepathic communication). The objects observed in these close encounters are of a physical nature as evidenced by the physical traces left in the environment (burned vegetation, imprints in the soil, etc.) These highly strange cases could be evidence of ETH or could be related to another hypoth- esis not yet formulated. It is a travesty that the scientific com- munity has not adequately addressed the UFO phenomenon, but instead has rel- egated it to the status of Pseudoscience. In this vacuum of intellectual curiosity, MUFON has operated for the last 38 years, assisted by a small group of in- terested academics who form an “in- visible college”. We hope that the Meet- ing of the Minds workshop call to ac- tion will stimulate others in the academic community to join this invisible college. Redrarn Witness Map"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"      7 MUFON UFO Journal April 2007 By John B. Ringer Historical Anomalist Few aspects of modern life are more iconic than the airplane. From its humble beginning on the fields of Kitty Hawk, heavier-than-air flight has captured both our imaginations and our loyalty—despite the escalating hassles of airport security. Manned flight in recent history The Wright brothers made their historic first flight in 1903. Others, such as Samuel Pierpont Langley, were experimen- ting with airplanes as early as 1896, but Langley couldn’t get his device off the ground. Humans had flown in lighter- than-air vehicles before the Wright brothers. In 1900, German inventor Ferdinand von Zeppelin launched the first flight in which a gondola capable of holding a human being was suspended beneath a “powered” hydrogen-filled bag. Dirigibles proved to be too vulnerable to fire or storms, however, and they passed from use prior to World War II. 1 In 1853, English engineer George Cayley was the first to build and fly a glider capable of carrying a man through the air. Rather than climbing aboard himself, however, Cayley ordered his servant to make the flight. Luckily for the coachman, it worked. Even earlier, two Frenchmen were the first humans to fly through the air in a human-made device when they launched their unpowered hot- air balloon 120 years before the Wrights. 1 More ancient flying machines There is, however, more to the story of human flight. Most of us are familiar with tales of flying carpets, skyward chariots, and even Biblical figures such as Ezekiel and Solomon, who “flew” from place to place. The ancient Greeks told of men creating artificial wings in an attempt to fly. Closer to our own time, even Leonardo da Vinci made realistic drawings of flying machines. It’s easy for us to take this in with a knowing smile—the stuff of fantasy. But we can also read about something quite different—a very early aircraft called the vimana. These sophisticated flying machines date back to the earliest civilizations, primarily in India. Vimanas were nothing like our own humble begin- nings with flight, but were sleek, fast, maneuverable, and capable of mysterious behavior. Many have likened them to the UFO sightings of our own times. Let’s consider one culture which claims to have seen and used them. The Vedic society of ancient India left detailed records of their activities and experiences. The Vedic texts were originally part of an oral tradition, typical of the time. Scholars have recently determined that oral histories tended to be passed on through the generations with surprising fidelity. Even after writing had become widespread in India, it was prohibited to write down the Vedas, a ban that was in force until about 1,000 years ago, the date of the earliest surviving written versions. 4 Ancient texts tell of flying machines Vedic writing was recorded on parch- ment, palm leaves or another vulnerable medium, so the originals have not survived nearly as well as the clay tablets of Sumer. To the natural ravages of the millennia, we also must add the deliberate destruction of ancient documents, although India experienced less of this than most places. What we do have for study are copies, or more likely, copies of copies which have surfaced over the years. There is always the problem of provenance, as well as the difficulties surrounding translation and interpretation. And there is the matter of separating fact from fiction. Some historians are skeptical of claims that certain documents have been “hidden” in various underground caves or in remote temples. But given the human penchant for burning and looting over the centuries, who could blame those who valued ancient wisdom for being secretive? Travel to other worlds, other planes In Vedic society, it was accepted that one could travel to other worlds, other star systems and even other dimensions. They also thought it possible to leave the material worlds altogether and travel in higher planes. More pragmatically, these same people understood that the physical Earth is a globe, and they knew its diameter correctly. They also measured the apparent movement of the sun around the Earth and referred to this as the “flat disk of Earth.” 3 The Puranas speak of 400,000 humanlike races living on the various planets and of 8,000,000 other life forms, including plants and lower animals. Earth- bound humans were said to be among the least powerful of the humanoid types. 3 Quite a few documents claim the people of ancient India built (or were given) and flew aircraft with advanced (even by our standards) capabilities. Just what do they say? Description of the Vimanas The Samarangana Sutradhara says that Vimanas are made of light material, with a strong, well-shaped body. Iron, copper, mercury and lead were used in their construction. Strong and durable must the body be made, like a great flying bird, of light material. Inside it, one must place the Mercury-engine, with its iron heating apparatus beneath. By means of the power latent in the mercury, which sets the driving whirlwind in motion, a man sitting inside may travel a great dis- tance in the sky in the most marvelous manner. Similarly, by using the prescribed process, one can build a vimana as large as the temple of the God-in-motion. Four strong mercury containers must be built into the interior structure. When these have been heated by controlled fire from iron containers, the vimana develops thunder-power through the mercury. And at once it becomes a pearl in the sky. 2 The Ramayana, another ancient text, describes a vimana as a double-deck, circular or cylindrical aircraft with portholes and a dome. It flew with the “speed of the wind” and gave forth a “melodious sound.” 2 Vimanas, The Flying Craft of Ancient India Continued on page 10"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" April 2007 8 MUFON UFO Journal How Math may Explain Unidentified Objects in the Twilight Sky Figure 1, top. Figure 2, bottom. By Donald R. Burleson, Ph.D. UFO investigators may find it useful to be aware of some circum- stances that can arise with regard to sightings that take place during the first few minutes after sunset or during the last few minutes before sunrise. We all know that under certain lighting conditions, any number of essentially stationary aerial objects, cer- tainly including some types of clouds, can take on so striking an appearance that people report them as UFOs. I have found that with a little elementary mathematics and the help of a scientific calculator, it is possible to think in a very specific way about such sightings, in terms of the amount of time after sunset (or before sunrise) when these sightings occur, and in terms of the altitude of the object seen. This is because at these times of day, objects aloft can reflect sunlight during mathematically describable periods, even though the sun is below the horizon to the observer. Everything depends on the angular rate of rotation of the earth, which is 360 degrees every 24 hours (approxi- mately). Dividing 360 degrees by 24 hours gives a rotation rate of 15 degrees per hour, or, more convenient- ly, 15/60 = 0.25 degrees per minute. The radius of the earth at the equator is approximately 3963.189 miles on average. Now imagine, for example, the parallel of 40 degrees north latitude as a band encircling the earth. (This band would pass near Indianapolis.) It will be necessary to find the average radius of this latitudinal circle; see Figure 1. This smaller radius can easily be computed by multiplying the equatorial radius of the earth by the cosine of the latitudinal angle 40 degrees, producing 3963.189 ° (cos 40 degrees) = 3963.189 ° 0.766044443 = 3035.979 miles. Now imagine looking down at this 40-degrees-latitude circle from an aerial position above the North Pole; see the ground, R denotes the radius of the latitudinal circle, Y denotes its center, and A denotes the angle through which the earth has rotated the observer away from the sun since sunset. (Cirrus clouds often do occur at altitudes around 40,000 feet, and since they are ice-crystal clouds, they can reflect sunlight with almost metallic intensity.) Strictly speaking, in Figure 2, the cloud does not quite lie in the plane of the latitudinal circle (unless one is at the equator), but little error is generated by assuming that it does, since such a cloud’s altitude is less than two thou- sandths of the radius of the earth. For simplicity’s sake we shall treat the cloud as if it did lie in the plane of the circle. Under that assumption the approxi- mate distance from the latitudinal circle’s center to our hypothetical cirrus cloud is R + h, or 3035.979 + 7.576 = 3043.555 miles. If you divide R by R + h, getting 3035.979/3043.555 = 0.997510806, you have the cosine of the angle A; see triangle YTC in the diagram. Now hit the “inverse cosine” key (be sure your scientific calculator is in degree mode, not radian mode, when you do this), and the result is that the angle of rotation A is 4.043497363 degrees. Since the earth rotates through ¼ of a degree (0.25 degrees) per minute, it will take four times the obtained rotation angle, or about 16.174 minutes to rotate through the angle A, which makes about 16 minutes and 10 seconds. The earth has rotated the earth- bound observer away from the sun, so that from observer X’s point of view the sun is below the horizon, but from the position of the cloud the sun would still be visible for a while, not yet having been “rotated out of sight” of the sun’s rays. In a short amount of time, though, the further rotation of the earth will of course take the sun’s apparent position below the horizon even from the point of view of the cloud, but there are a few minutes during which the light still strikes the cloud, and during this interval the cloud’s reflectivity may be quite remarkable to the earthbound observer. In this case, the interval of time has turned out, by the above calculations, to be about 16 minutes and 10 seconds. Our cirrus cloud, at 40 degrees of latitude and at an altitude of 40,000 feet, will continue to reflect sunlight for about the indicated length of time. This then is a critical time interval under the circumstances. Clearly, with regard to clouds or other essentially stationary objects (e.g., some balloons) at whatever altitude, Figure 2. Imagine, also, a cloud 40,000 feet (or 40,000/5280 = 7.576 miles) above the surface of the earth, observed at 40 degrees north latitude a short time after sunset. In Figure 2, C denotes the cloud, h denotes its height or altitude, X denotes an observer on"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"      9 MUFON UFO Journal April 2007 Twilight Sightings Continued from page 8 these intervals of time are periods in which such things in the sky can assume a highly suggestive appearance, especially against a backdrop of partially darkened sky, and it is little wonder that they often get reported as anomalous objects. One notices, with the given calcu- lations, that the period of “twilight reflectivity” depends, at least by our somewhat simplified mathematical model, only upon the height of the object and the latitude (north or south) at which the sighting occurs. By plugging in various other altitudes in place of the 40,000 feet, I have also calculated the approximate time intervals for these other altitudes, all assumed to apply to sightings made at 40 degrees of latitude, as shown in the table. Needless to say, these time intervals are indeed approximate, mostly because the simple mathematical model here does not factor in seasonal shifts due to the tilt of the earth’s axis; however, the approximations are reasonably close for practical purposes. One may want to round them to the nearest half-minute, say, to avoid claiming too much precision. Look at the table entry for an alti- tude of 15,000 feet. This was computed for 40 degrees latitude, but one may of course go through the same procedure for other latitudes, simply using the cosine of whatever latitude angle applies. For example, for an altitude again of 15,000 feet but at an observer position of 35 degrees north latitude this time (the parallel of latitude at Albuquerque), the latitudinal radius turns out to be 3246.300 miles, and the reflectivity time works out to be about 9 minutes and 35 seconds, or about 20 seconds less than what happened at 40 degrees latitude. Similarly, for 45 degrees north latitude (e.g. in Minneapolis/St. Paul) the latitudinal radius is 2802.264 miles, and the reflectivity interval comes out to about 10 minutes and 19 seconds, or 24 seconds longer than what happened at 40 degrees latitude. As one moves further away from the equator, an aerial object at a given altitude reflects below-the-horizon sunlight longer, but in mid-latitudes, a difference of a few degrees’ latitude makes only a few seconds’ difference in reflectivity time, as one would expect. The fact that high stationary objects can only reflect sunlight for a short and approximately computable amount of time after sunset (or before sunrise) means, among other things, that some objects cannot readily be accounted for in those terms. If such an object is seen, say, an hour after sunset at typical latitudes, it cannot be a cloud or balloon reflecting below-the-horizon sunlight unless the altitude is improbably high. Conversely, for a stationary object, one may mathematically invert the above procedure. If one has observed how long an object has continued to reflect sunlight after sunset, one may compute a good estimate of the object’s altitude. An example will illustrate the “inverse” procedure without dwelling on all the mathematical theory. Suppose, at 40 degrees north latitude, we observe that a stationary object has continued to reflect sunlight for 13 minutes and 25 seconds, or 13.417 minutes. First as before we find the “latitudinal radius” (sometimes called the “cosine-corrected radius”) by finding the cosine of 40 degrees and multiplying by the earth’s equatorial radius: 3963.189 ° cos 40 = 3035.979. Save this result. Now take the elapsed time of 13.417 minutes and divide it by 4 to produce 3.35425. Find the cosine of this (be sure the calculator is in degree mode): cos (3.35425 degrees) = 0.998286865. Press the 1/x key to find the reciprocal: 1.001716075. Subtract 1 from this to produce 0.001716075. Finally, multiply by the latitudinal radius: 0.001716075 ° 3035.979 = 5.21 miles, or 5.21 ° 5280 = 27,500 feet approximately. This is a good estimate of the object’s altitude. In summary, solely due to the earth’s angular rate of rotation, there is an accessible, approximate relation (at any given latitude) between the altitude of a stationary object and the length of time it reflects sunlight from an “already set” TABLE 1. (for 40 deg. N or S latitude) Approx.

For the mathematically inclined, the formulas are shown in Figure 3. It should be clear from these observations that the first few minutes after sunset or before sunrise, while a problematical time for witnesses, can be an exceedingly interesting time for UFO investigators.

This document describes in great detail how to build a vimana, and, more surprisingly, just how to fly them. However, G.R. Josyer, in his translation of the book , points out that it was written by a psychic process known as “chan- neling.” So, while unquestionably an interesting read, it can’t be counted in the same league as genuine Vedic texts. 3 The Ramayana , or “Rama’s Way” is one of India’s great epics handed down over thousands of years to the present. The Ramayana is some 25,000 verses long, and tells the story of romantic courtly intrigue, heroic renunciation, fierce battles and the triumph of good over evil. The hero, Prince Rama of Ayodhya, after being bilked out of his claim to the throne, leaves the city to roam the wilds. He engages the evil demon king Ravana of Ceylon in combat, and both sides use powerful weapons which are hurled from flying machines. These weapons destroy whole cities and disintegrate whole armies. 2 The story of Rama is fairly typical of these tales of olden India. While the technology of the demigods is wonderful, even awesome, the destruction which comes from their numerous wars is truly awful! From the Mahabharata : Gurkha, flying a swift and powerful vimana, hurled a single projectile charged with all the power of the Universe. An incandescent column of smoke and flame, as bright as ten thousand suns, rose with all its splendor. It was an unknown weapon, an iron thunderbolt, a gigantic messenger of death, which reduced to ashes the entire race of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas. The corpses were so burned as to be unrecognizable. Hair and nails fell out; pottery broke without apparent cause, and the birds turned white. There is more, but you get the idea. Vimanas then common as airplanes now Richard L. Thompson, scientist and Vedic researcher, points out that vimanas in ancient India seemed as commonplace as airplanes are to us today. 3 Accounts of these flying machines pop up in stories in an almost casual way. One tale involves the sage Kardama Muni, who is describing the beauty of his future wife, Devahuti, to her father: I have heard that Visavasu, his mind stupefied with infatuation, fell from his airplane after seeing your daughter playing with a ball on the roof of the palace, for she was indeed beautiful with her twinkling ankle bells and her eyes moving to and fro. 3 (Obviously, he wasn’t wearing his seatbelt.) Built by humans or demigods? From both fables and historic tales, we learn that vimanas could be quite small, housing just one person. They could also be the size of mansions or small cities. Some resemble our own aircraft in size and shape, but most were circular, cylindrical, or even irregular in shape. There are good indications that, while humans could and did build simple vimanas, the more advanced kind were built and controlled by non-standard human beings. On occasion, these technically superior craft might be given to a regular human for his personal use. From a variety of Vedic sources, here are some characteristics of vimanas: * They could cloak themselves or become invisible. * They were described as brilliant, glowing, or fiery in the sky. * Vimanas could produce a paralyzing force which incapacitated other vimana. * Their flight was often erratic or zigzag. * These craft could change shapes. * Pilots could use a viewing device to see within another craft. * Vimanas could travel beyond Earth. * They could be large enough to carry troops or weapons. * An engine which used mercury propelled at least some of the craft. * Either vimanas or some other device could create a tempest, and this was often used as a defensive weapon. (Alexander the Great is even reported to have been foiled by this kind of fierce wind.) So, what do we know for sure? Well, certainty is not a state usually associated with anomalies. We know there were people in ancient India (how far back they existed is debatable) and that they produced countless, varied documents in Sanskrit. They tell stories of Gods, demigods, humans and animals, all of whom coexisted on Earth. The demigods (and occasionally mere humans) were said to fly the heavens in fantastic vehicles, and all too often, these beings waged war on one another or upon hapless humans. We have very little physical evidence of such goings on, but then it was a long time ago. It doesn’t seem we have made much of an effort to look either, even when the artifacts are as obvious as cities under water just off the coast of India. 4 After all, they are just stories and myths.

The Society for Scientific Exploration Dear Editor: I was surprised to see an article by Uriarte and Reichmuth in the March 2007 issue of the MUFON UFO Jour- nal on a number of videos taken in Mexico where the image filmed was human-shaped. The authors thought of a possible explanation in the implausible tests of rocket belt technology over ur- ban areas, which they show themselves not to be applicable. Aslo, it is well known the Mexican culture of balloons with a huge diversity of them in shapes, sizes, colors, etc. In the specific cases of videos taken in the state of Cuernavaca and in Mexico City in the year 2000 (and further), I would refer to the reader to the entry of April 19, 2006, in my personal FOTOCAT blog http:// fotocat.blogspot.com/ 2006_04_19_archive.html, where these videos were identified as balloons shaped like the Buzz Light Year charac- ter! There, one of those video clips can be downloaded for inspection and ob- vious concurrence. In Mexico, today, every well-versed mainstream ufologists, except those commercially-biased, agree with this explanation. I hope to have clarified this issue.

The UFOCrawler, found online at www .ufocrawler .com was developed to make it easier to conduct advanced research and tap information and knowledge sources worldwide on topics such as UFO sightings, time travel, conspiracy theories and anoma- lies. Powered by IBM OmniFind Yahoo! Edition enterprise search software, UFOCrawler helps users precisely target and gather information from relevant sources, including thousands of documents and files collected in the vast Anomalies Network archive, as well as multiple global resources across the Web on topics such as such as ghosts, con- spiracy theories and extraterrestrials. Previously, using a conventional Web search engine—doing a search on “Area 51,” for example—would return thousands of irrelevant and inaccurate results. UFOCrawler helps users more clearly define and target their search to a particular topic, for instance to search for information about an aurora sighted over Area 51. UFOCrawler is tuned to search for and deliver the specific information requested or refine an area of interest. “Only through raw information can people form their own opinions about what is happening out there,” said Olav Phillips, founder, the Anomalies Network. “The questions about the paranormal are some of the most fundamental questions of humanity. People can’t draw conclusions, make a decision or form an opinion based on a single sighting or event. UFOCrawler is designed to give users a more holistic view of all the informa- tion sources they need to decide for themselves.” In addition to launching UFOCrawler today, The Anomalies Network is also introducing numerous site enhancements to enable better collaboration among users as well as major performance enhancements to the site. The site enhancements includes all new content and features to enable more users to contribute, collaborate and dynamically share information based on their interests. A new user- driven search and RSS subscriptions as well as account access also enable users to customize and view only information of interest to them. “With the connectivity improve- ments we are making thanks to Silicon Valley Web Hosting, coupled with the advanced global caching platform offered by Netli we will be seeing a massive increase in performance. Both services are best of breed and will allow us to offer even more advanced services to our visitors in the future,” Phillips added. “The web, especially web 2.0 is about speed and reliability. The combination of Netli’s global caching and Silicon Valley Web Hosting’s state of the art datacenter provide the best possible environment for our evolution as a site and service to our visitors.” In existence for more than 10 years, the Anomalies Network is the world’s largest online UFO and paranormal community with over a million pageviews per month. The site is designed to serve as a super archive to make the location of related information easier. Built almost entirely on open source software, the Anomalies Network uses the CentOS Linux distribution, Apache, Tomcat, MySQL and PHP in addition to IBM OmniFind Yahoo! Edition. IBM OmniFind Yahoo! Edition is a no-cost, entry level enterprise search product with Web search services powered by Yahoo! that enables departments and businesses of all sizes to quickly and easily find, access and capitalize on information stored within organizations and across the Web.

How- ever, these cases have not been officially investigated, unless noted. George Filer Arizona Unknown Object Filmed APACHE JUNCTION— A friend and I were traveling along Highway 60 by Gold Canyon on January 28, 2007. Robert was driving, while I was observing the skies and saw a suspicious looking cloud hanging along Superstition Mountains. I felt intuitively something was going to appear around that cloud. As Robert drove, I began clicking many shots with my Digital Panasonic Lumix (Mega D.I.S. 5.0) camera as quickly as I could. We were traveling 70 mph on the freeway, so it was a bit tricky with all the trees passing us by. Just as I was able to get a clear shot of the mountain and this strange cloud, I shot the photo when suddenly appearing in the photo was this UFO. I know this may sound strange to some folks, but it was like the UFO was “just waiting” to jump into the shot when I could photograph with a clear view. Very exciting!! I share this because I was feeling so strongly the presence of something showing up, and it did. Many of you reading these reports may have feelings like this. I recommend, “Go with your gut feeling, because you will usually capture a UFO.” I believe there is a telepathic communication which takes place when I film, and I know many other investigators and even novice photog- raphers experience this. Robert did the photo study on the UFO using different filters and plug-ins used on the object. He used Photoshop’s Emboss, Photoshop Find- Edges, and Flaming Pear’s Lacquer. You can see the energy field on a couple of them. Report by Victoria Liljenquist, Phoenix, AZ www.victoriaslight.com Sighting from Highway 60, Arizona, USA California Air Force Reserve Videotapes UFO RIVERSIDE— The witness re- ported he sighted an object on March 3, 2007, about 2:30 PM. Twenty minutes after the first sighting he saw a second object. He was outside playing with his kids and noticed a black triangular shaped object with “white glowing tips” moving to the south. He immediately grabbed his Sony DVD Camcorder and began taping. He said, “The object changed into an orb and then eventually into a disc that wobbled.” He lost sight of the object as it approached the sun. The witness then went to converse with a neighbor about his sighting and then noticed a second object towards the east. He again grabbed his video camera and began taping. This object was triangular shaped and moved towards the south, but it displayed a rapid side to side movement. This object was pulsating. The witness zoomed into both objects with his camcorder. The witness stated that he saw military aircraft in the area probably from March Air Reserve Base. Investigator’s Notes: T his sighting was reported by a highly credible witness, an Air Reservist (Aircraft Structural Maintenance Worker). Obviously the witness is familiar with “state-of-the-art” military aircraft. He plainly stated that this “was not ours.” The fact that the witness noticed that the first object changed shapes is most unusual.

She pointed up to the sky and we saw then what looked like a silver ball floating down from the sky like a leaf. She ran inside to get binoculars and the ship turned over. With the binoculars we could see so much of this equipment. The metal was very shiny and smooth as if molded. We could see what looked like 5 or 6 engines all spinning in different directions. Inside those tubes were more tubes spinning in the opposite direction as the big tube. Instead of fire coming out of these it looked more like lava or coals being sucked into these tubes. The engines seemed to stop spinning from the inside tube first then the outside one would stop. It then again appeared to turn and you could see the saucer shape. It fell behind two mountains. The smoke trail was gone within 10 minutes... Thanks to Peter Davenport Director www.ufocenter.com Washington, DC Saucer The witness reports seeing a hovering saucer-shaped object near tree-top level, with yellow flashing lights making no sound on March 5, 2007, at 7 PM. The saucer was then approached by a second triangular or “flying wing” shaped object that was also silent. It was not well lit, and was bronze colored. The triangle hovered nearby and seemed to fade slowly from view, possibly obscured by a cloud. The witness watched for ten minutes, then had to leave. The first object was still in view at that time.

I opened my eyes to look up to see a shooting star as it shot across the sky in one direction and quickly disap-peared. I was thinking I should make a wish, when it reappeared moving in different directions at incredible speed. It had white, red, orange and blue lights and the size of an average star. After five minutes of watching, I woke up my boyfriend to tell him to look at the star but he said, “Nah it’s because the boat is moving.” It reappeared, brighter, and this time he was quiet trying to focus and saw it swerve in a zigzag motion. My boyfriend let out “Wow.” I looked back at the object and he informed me that it just made a spectacular circular motion and he started recording on his camcorder. We noticed an aeroplane moving towards us and we compared them, deciding that there is no way that UFO is a plane. Then we watched the UFO move towards the west until it faded. We arrived at the shores in complete awe. It was one of the most memorable moments in my life and I will probably never come across a UFO again. Thanks to Peter Davenport http://www.nuforc.com. United Kingdom—Strange Lights SOMERSET COUNTY —Laura Thorpe reports, “Strange lights in the night sky have prompted readers of the Somerset County Gazette to question the existence of UFOs.” At about 10 PM on Monday night, March 13, 2007, a sighting of a strange glow in the sky was reported by Fay Boyd of Kingston St. Mary, Richard Fowle of Cheddon Road in Taunton, and his son Edward. Mrs. Boyd told the County Gazette: “There was a long vertical light, it was not a star but I have no explanation for it. As far as I can tell it didn’t stay there very long, I don’t normally believe in the paranormal but it was very strange.” The object was seen as a “vertical shaft of light” by witnesses. The photo was taken by Richard Fowle. Stargazer Fowles of Taunton states, “This fascinating occurrence could be the rare phenomenon known as the Zodiacal Light, a ghostly cone of illumination caused by the reflection of the Sun’s light from millions of tiny particles in the plane of the Earth’s and Venus’ orbits. It’s visible just after twilight, a vast faint triangular glow rising from Venus upward into the constellation of Aries. If it is the Zodiacal Light it’ll be visible until about March 20 towards the west.” Thanks to Reporter : laura.thorpe@countygazette.co.uk UFO or Zodiacal Light?"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" April 2007 16 MUFON UFO Journal Early last November, twenty United Airlines employees witnessed what could be noted as an UFO hovering several minutes above one of the passenger terminals at O’Hare Airport in Chicago. It rocketed through the clouds, creating a hole in the cloud deck 1900 feet above the airport. FAA officials, in the agency’s attempt to attack the credibility of these otherwise trusted airline employees, asserted that its radar network never painted nor tracked this so-called anomaly. (This sighting was reported in the February 2007 MUFON UFO Journal .) No military explanation One, the military would never conduct any stunt such as this in the form of a training flight over one of the busiest—if not the busiest—civilian airports in North America. Two, the military doesn’t have any aircraft like this in its inventory that can remain sus- pended, stationary, and rotating like a frisbee. Three, mankind has produced nothing in the way of a flying machine which would shoot straight upward making a prodigious hole in an overcast cloud deck. Four, so-called weather balloons such as the one in Roswell, New Mexico, back in 1947 just don’t fly the way this thing did as it left O’Hare airspace. Five, despite what the FAA would have us to believe, these United Airlines employees are not idiots.

We positioned the height finder radar toward the direction of Grand Marais and saw a positive radar presentation at an altitude of 1000 feet. The Operations Officer in charge of this midnight watch was called to the radar room. He in turn contacted Air Defense Sector Headquarters in Duluth to scramble four F-106 aircraft— at that time, the best fighter interceptor in American air defense inventory. Both height and search radar contin- ued to paint the radar returns of this thing as it came toward the radar site at minimum speed. Halfway towards Grand Marais airspace 60 miles northeast, the four jets intercepted it. The spaceship started playing cat and mouse with these jets, as the pilots screamed over the air- to-ground communication system how this craft was able to abruptly change speed and direction in mid-flight. Tracked at 28,000 mph As they chased it out over Lake Superior, the silent disc ascended to an altitude of 20,000 feet leaving the fly- boys behind screaming [expletive deleted] comments into their headsets. Ten minutes later, it returned to an altitude just above water level with the jets again in hot pursuit. It took off again, this time to the northeast beyond radar coverage, leaving the jets farther in its wake. Over the next 45 minutes, things began to quiet down. By this time, everyone at the entire radar site was up at this 4:00 AM hour. The jets had returned to base. But suddenly, here it came again, this time from due east as radar painted its position 130 miles away. Several minutes later someone screamed, “Here it comes!” Looking east, I saw this colossal disc quietly slicing through the air coming right at us 100 feet above the radar towers. It appeared to be dark silver and was windowless. The GIs cheered. This Herculean craft passed above us on a course heading northwest. In the far distance, we could see it hovering above an area known to have high voltage power lines, remaining there for several minutes. Suddenly, the disc launched from this hovering position. Radar tracked it going 200 miles from an altitude of 1000 feet to 85,000 feet in 12 seconds which translates to 28,000 mph. The invader left, never to return that night nor anytime thereafter. Once the furor was over, everyone went back to barracks. Two days later, brass from the North American Air Defense Command, Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado, visited the site. They took depositions from the Commander, Operations Officer, First Sergeant, and various other site illuminaries. The three NORAD colonels left the site, and to this day, all the data and relevant information relating to this event remains buried with NORAD. We know what we saw My fellow airmen and I know what we saw that early morning in 1966 on a Minnesotan mountain ridge housing a radar site from which official air defense operations were conducted 24/7/365. These United Airlines employees saw what they saw this past November, all in clear and sober states-of-mind, and without question, what was seen certainly isn’t from around here. Earl Beal was stationed at Finland AFS in Finland, Minnesota as a radar technician from August 1965 through September 1966. He remembers the area quite well. earlbeal@yahoo.com O’Hare witnesses probably credible; Airman relates spaceship sighting observed by many in Minnesota By Earl Beal"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"      17 MUFON UFO Journal April 2007 Field Investigator’s Corner MUFON Field Investigators Manual The official Mutual UFO Network guidelines for in-depth UFO investigation Price includes shipping/handling: Member U.S. or Canada: $28.50 Non-Member U.S. or Canada $38.50 Member Foreign: $49.50 Non-Member Foreign: $59.50 Order online at: www.mufon.com/invmanual.htm by Chuck Reever MUFON Director of Investigations Each month we publish the CMS Ranking Report for all State Directors. Congratulations to Kenneth E. Cherry (Texas), Bland Pugh (Florida), Donald R. Burleson (New Mexico) for being 1st, 2nd and 3rd respectively in the month of March. The report is based on our two measures of UFO Investigation effectiveness: assigning reports within 48 hours of receipt, and completing all investigations within 60 days of being assigned. The Assigned column is a six-month running average of the number of cases assigned within 48 hours divided by the total number of cases received in that six-month period. The Completed column is the number of cases completed beginning sixty-two (62) days back and going back six months from there (for a total of eight months back) divided by the total number of cases reported in the same period. The Weighted Rank is the average of the two columns expressed as a percent. State Directors can improve their scores by being sure to assign all cases within 48 hours, and following up with their Field Investigators to ensure all reports are completed within 60 days. To be considered complete, a report must have been investigated and placed in one of the three com- pleted status codes (Unknown, Hoax or IFO) by the State Director. If you have any questions or need help with your investigations please contact Churck Reever at 530-414- 4341 or 530-582-8339 or via e-mail at wizard@telis.org.

Friedman When Photographs Lie and When they Tell the Truth Recently someone on the UFO Updates list asked when others thought that cameras would be so ubiquitous that photographic proof of flying saucers would be achieved. Many responded that photographs would never be convincing to debunkers. After all, with today’s computer software, almost any- thing can be faked. Con- sider how good Hollywood has become at creating genuine-appearing but false sequences. Others pointed out that while cell phone cameras are every- where, the photos they produce are hardly high quality. A good analysis of a photo’s veracity should address all factors including not only the camera, but the photographer, details of the location, and so forth. There have been long discussions about even classic photos such as those of the Rex Heflin case, the Trinidade case, the McMinnville case, and others. One reason I use older photos in my lecture is that at least we can be sure that they were not made by a home computer expert having fun. One must indeed be wary, considering the capabilities of today’s software. Twelve-year-olds can create UFO pictures these days. Not Always What They Seem I am often asked to review stills and videos that have impressed the photographer, but leave me cold. A light sitting still for many minutes in the sky at night with nothing else in the frame to provide scale or distance comparison is just not very useful. It might depict an alien spacecraft, but no definitive evidence is provided. Also I am wary of most pix of which the photographer says, “I didn’t see anything (at the time), but look at this small dot on the print.” Others ask me if what they show me isn’t the best UFO picture I have ever seen. I try to gently say that frankly there are many much better UFO pictures which I use in my lectures. Most of today’s 3.5 or 6 mega- pixel digital cameras have much poorer resolution than the film used in “old fashioned” 35mm film cameras. It seems ironic that if the pictures of the replacement radar reflector balloon material taken in General Ramey’s Fort Worth office on July 8, 1947, had been taken with a typical digital camera instead of a speed graphic, they could not have been read by Dr. David Rudiak.* The recent 10 th anniversary of the Phoenix lights sighting reminds us of other camera-related controversies. This sighting—the flyover of a huge triangle slowly and silently from Prescott south to Phoenix and then to Tucson—was observed by literally thousands of people around 8 PM on March 13, 1997. Around 10 PM many also observed very bright lights slowly drifting down and seemingly being turned off. Later investigation estab- lished that these lights could be ex- plained as military battlefield illumina- tion flares dropped via parachutes from air national guard planes. They moved slowly because they were at a great distance and they went behind unseen mountain ranges. The press and some UFO investigators such as Dr. Lynn Kitie combined reports of these flares with the reports of the big triangle seen earlier that same evening. Bruce Maccabee determined the sight lines of photographers at two different loca- tions who filmed the flares. Where the sight lines crossed was many miles further than either photographer had thought. Photos the Public Never Sees It is unfortunately true that some of the best photographic instruments produce data that the public never gets to see. Think of military aircraft with gun cameras. Back in 1952 when military aircraft were instructed to shoot down UFOs, there must have been plenty of film taken. Since Major General Roger Ramey noted that hundreds of aircraft had been scrambled to chase UFOs, undoubt- edly film was shot. But gun camera film is not handled by the pilots, nor is it processed at the local drug store. Many years ago after my lecture at Indiana University, Indianapolis, I asked my usual question of the audi- ence: how many had experienced UFO sightings as I had defined the term at the beginning of my lecture? I counted the usual 10%. I asked how many had reported what they had seen 90% of the hands came down. When I asked how many of those remaining had been in the military at the time of their sighting, one hand remained up. I asked if he would tell us about it as I get some very interesting reports that way. He said: “They took my pic- tures,” and nothing more. I said I wouldn’t ask for his name, but I was Stanton Friedman"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"      19 MUFON UFO Journal April 2007 sure the audience would like to hear the story. He told us that he had been flying an Air Force plane over the Pacific when another plane, 20 miles ahead, radioed that there was a saucer heading his way. Gun cameras were used to take pictures as it approached. The pilot radioed the base to which they were headed. Upon arrival the film was taken from the gun cameras, the crew was debriefed and told to never say anything about it. I should stress that the pilot didn’t get a chance to see the footage. He had “no need to know.” A similar situation exists for footage taken of rocket launches by high performance cameras to assure that problems are noted, but which also have on occasion recorded saucers near the rocket. This data is born classified. The film taken by spy satellites is also born classified as is footage taken by cameras recording military radar screens. Yes, we do have cameras capable of reading license plates on cars in the parking lot of the Kremlin. That film is obviously off limits. It’s Bird, It’s a Plane, It’s a UFO What about all those astronomers using fancy telescopes? People seem to think that astronomers at an obser- vatory are walking around looking for something to observe with their telescopes. In truth, essentially all telescopes have their viewing preplanned and controlled by comput- ers. Rarely do astronomers look through telescopes. Film and CCDs (charge-coupled devices, a type of image sensor) are used. It’s important to understand that telescopes are normally focused on objects such as planets, stars and galaxies at a great distance, and are not focused at points within the atmosphere. Obviously the field of view of a telescope is very small and the time during which a flying object, plane, bird, or UFO would be within view is very brief. When I lived in Pittsburgh, Penn- sylvania, 40 years ago, I was told that of 100,000 pictures taken of the sky by the Allegheny Observatory, only five gave an indication of a bird or plane, despite the probable large number of birds and planes flying by. People are often quite surprised when I point out that an aspirin tablet held at arm’s length can cover the moon. They often guess it would take a quarter or half dollar. The moon seems large but how many of us have observed a plane flying across the face of the moon? The field of view is actually small and crossing time is very short. It’s Human Nature to Watch Another problem standing in the way of getting good pictures is human nature. I talked to a California police officer who had been standing next to his patrol car when a UFO went over. It was only after it was gone that he remembered that he had a camera in the car. An engineer told me he was on the sidewalk in front of his house when he spotted a saucer in the sky. He stood there gawking at it, not thinking to call a neighbor down the street who always had a loaded camera. Curiosity and the desire to observe as much as he could pre- vented him from seeking another witness, even one with a camera. Furthermore, I would bet that there are lots of pictures that have never seen the light of day because the photographer did not want any attention or may have been concerned about ridicule or notoriety. It is inter- esting that Fife Symington, the Arizona governor during the 1997 Phoenix Lights sightings, ridiculed the reports and the efforts of City Councilman Francis Barwood to find out more. Ten years later, Symington admitted that he had seen the triangle that night. He was also a pilot and generally familiar with the sky. At the time he had legal problems and didn’t want the attention a positive report would have brought him. One must also remember General Bolender’s 1969 comment that reports of UFOs which could affect national security were not part of the Blue Book system. One wonders whether the files of the French government’s UFO investigations (recently placed on the internet) include reports of aircraft chasing UFOs or being attacked by them.

My good friends Robert Lesniakiewicz and Dr. Milos Jesensky have alerted me to artifacts located west of the Moonshaft area. Devilish Balls The villagers call one area the Place of Devilish Rocks and Balls. It is located some 60 miles from the Moonshaft site, near the Slovakian-Czech border in the Javorniky Mountains. The stone balls found there measures from 1.0 meter to 3.05 meters in diameter. Lesniakiewicz reports: “They are from the Tertiary period, but nobody knows how these balls originated. Other strange artifacts called the “spherical negatives” are empty spaces in the rock bodies with a very regular ball shape. Dr. Jesensky and I presented our favor- ite theory, that these balls are remnants of an ancient civilization(s), which had ex- isted there for many thousands of years. “The problem of the devilish stones has been researched by Polish ufologists since the 1970s, when they realized that UFOs very often appeared in the vicin- ity of those erratic stones and other megalithic constructions, such as rings of alles stones in the Diry, Wesiory and Grzybnica-Rosnowo villages. They are not so impressive as Stonehenge, but they were erected 6,000 or even 8,000 years ago.” (Alles stones are ring-shaped formations of erratic, unusual stones.) A photograph of one of the balls is presented here. Obviously this area is on my list of places to visit when I return to the Moonshaft area. Wall of the Giants, Fossa Giganteum The stone balls are just 20 miles from the north end of the Wall of the Giants ( Fossa Giganteum ). The wall begins at the hill Sitno in the Stiavince Mountains and runs from the northern to southern borders of Slovakia through the villages Pecenice and Dudince to the River Ipel. Part of the Wall forms a “natural” border be- tween the two counties of Zvolen and Levice, and is clearly recogniz- able today. Another well preserved part of the Wall is in Dudince east from Levice. Stones forming the Wall appear to have been fused together by intense heat. The length of the Wall is 80 km and its width is 8 meters. It is believed the prehistoric Wall is at least 7,000 years old. It is men- tioned as Fossa Giganteum in manu- scripts from the 13 th century. Ancient Edda songs also mention the Wall. Ancient Songs of Edda tell the tale Jan Hurnik has developed a theory about the Ancient Songs of Edda, the oldest known historical records, which came from Iceland. The songs are writ- ten in Old Icelandic, considered to be the remnant of an ancient world language. (The Slovak language is also very simi- lar to this ancient language, perhaps more similar than the Old Icelandic.) Hurnik theorizes that the Edda songs allude to events that occurred in the loca- tion of present Slovakia.

These events must have happened prior to the Neolithic revolution (5000 BC in the Slovakian region), because the Old Icelandic language did not include agronomical terminology. Stonehenge-like Structure On my second trip to Slovakia I was taken by the director of the Kezmarsky Hrad into the underground chambers beneath the castle. I was allowed to see many photographs from World War II which have not been released to the public. In one small chamber were old pho- tographs of a structure very similar to Stonehenge. I was not allowed to copy these images but was told the structure still stands not too far east of the castle. When I return I plan to try to get per- mission to visit this site. Unexplained Walls in the USA Much closer to home I have located two underground walls. When funding is available I plan to investigate these sites personally. The first site is near Hammondsville, Ohio. Writing from Wellsville, Ohio, in 1868, a correspondent of the Cleveland Herald wrote: “Capt. Lacy of Hammondsville, Ohio, had some men engaged in making an entry into his coal bank, when a huge mass of coal fell down, disclosing a large, smooth wall, upon the surface of which were plainly carved several lines of hieroglyphics. No one has yet been able to tell in what lan- guage the words are written. The let- ters are raised; the first line contains 25.” The men discovered this wall about 100 feet below the surface. Consider- ing its location beneath the coal the age must be considerable. The Scientific American for January 14, 1886, carries a report from the Lexington (Kentucky) Weekly Press that tells of the massive wall: “It had every appearance of hav- ing been built by human hands. Above it about ten feet of drift and twenty feet of rock had been removed by the work- men, and on the side exposed the men had advanced fully forty feet from where they first struck rock. Thus it was firmly embedded in a solid limestone quarry which certainly was formed about it since the wall was built.” The second wall, located in south- ern Oklahoma, was discovered deep in a coal mine in 1928. One of the miners present when the wall was found left a signed statement describing the find: “In the year 1928, I, Atlas Almon Mathis, was working in coal mine No. 5 located two miles north of Heavener, Oklahoma. This was a shaft mine and they told us it was two miles deep. The mine was so deep that they let us down into it on an elevator. The elevator was released at the top and fell so fast that I was weightless and my dinner bucket would turn upside down and the bail would hold it to my arm, however, the gallon of water in the bottom of it would not spill out. This elevator would fall at least several seconds at this rate and then they gradually slowed the elevator till it stopped at the bottom. They pumped air down to us, it was so deep. “Tom Davidson was in charge of the mine. Lu Elders, Monti Claiborn, ? Dawes, Bill Gresky, John Raiborn and a young fellow by the name of Mattox were working there also. “One night I shot 4 shots in room 24 of the mine and the next morning there were several concrete blocks laying in the floor.” Atlas A. Mathis Atlas told his grandson the wall was highly polished and that another miner struck this same wall about 100 to 150 Atlas Almon Mathis and family in 1928. Mathis’s statement about what he saw in the coal mine near Heavener, Oklahoma."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" April 2007 22 MUFON UFO Journal (Continued from page 2) Ted Phillips: Physical Traces Continued from page 21 yards from where the first section was found. The coal in the mine was prob- ably Carboniferous, which would mean the wall was at least 286 million years old. The mine was closed shortly after the find and the men were told not to speak about what they had seen. Atlas also said that in the area of the wall the mine would rumble fiercely as though a freight train was passing within a few feet. At such times the rock walls would glow and become transpar- ent. A number of very unusual artifacts were found inside coal veins in this and other mines in the area. These artifacts were of human construction without question. What are the connections? Do the American sites have some connection to the underground structures in Russia and Slovakia? I can only hope that funding will become available and answers found. I see documentaries on the History Channel and National Geo- graphic dealing with the same old tired stories. Perhaps it’s time to take off the blinders and look for something that could change our thinking about things far past. How science can reject such things out of hand has puzzled me for many years. There are enormous dis- coveries around us and beneath our feet if we have the nerve to just look. from outside our planet? Interdimensional technology from a so- ciety that resides a millimeter away? Time travelers from the future? One thing we can all agree on is that the an- ecdotal and physical evidence is over- whelming that there is a UFO reality, although we may disagree on what that reality is. MUFON recently hosted a stellar panel of both ufologists and scientists in a “Meeting of the Minds” workshop in Fort Collins, Colorado to debate this very question – whose technology is it? You can read more about what was discussed at the workshop in a special report in this month’s Journal.
