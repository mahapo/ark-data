By Walter H. Andrus, Jr. This is not going to be an account about the infamous alien autopsy videotape distributed world- wide by Ray Santilli, that was apparently a hoax per- petrated by unknown individuals. Noted paleontolo- gist, the late Bob Slaughter, Professor of Paleontology, and Director of the Shuler Museum at Southern Meth- odist University in Dallas, TX, deserves the recognition for this treatise motivated by his book titled Fossil Re- mains of Mythical Creatures. Please don't let the words \"mythical creatures\" detract from what is to follow in Pro- fessor Slaughter's first chap- ter titled, simply \"Alien.\" My photos of the diminutive human-like skeleton will un- doubtedly attract the attention of ufologists in our search for extraterrestrial alien bodies. Background preceding the discovery During the month of April 1897 numerous UFO sightings were reported in the newspapers from the Great Lakes to the Rio Grande River (more than a hun- dred in Texas alone). By far the most renowned is the described crash of a cigar-shaped airship just outside the town of Aurora, TX. According to S.E. Hayden, reporter and au- thor of an article that appeared in the Dallas Morning News (4/19/1897), early on the morning of April 17, 1897, a cigar-shaped airship flying low over Aurora, and traveling at only ten or twelve miles per hour, was viewed by a number of people. While amazed citizens watched, it crashed into a windmill on the property of Judge J. S. Proctor and exploded, mutilating the pilot and fragmenting the ship. The pilot's remains were buried the same day in the Aurora Cemetery. All that was said about the pilot was that it was a very small person, not of this world. Numerous pieces of an unusual metal have been recovered by MUFON through the aid of metal detec- tors near the destroyed windmill site. In 1973, samples of this metal were submitted by MUFON to a leading aerospace firm for their analysis. Two independent metallurgy laboratories within the same company found that the metal was mostly aluminum with six percent iron. The crystalline Bob Slaughter Professor Bob Slaughter During the 25 years that the late Bob Slaugh- ter was Professor of Paleontology and director of the Shuler Museum at Southern Methodist University, Dallas, he published three books and more than 100 articles and scholarly papers. He was president of the Texas Acad- emy of Science in 1971-72, and received the Award for Out- standing Contributions to Earth Science from the American Fed- eration of Mineralogical Societ- ies in 1983. He was also one of 12 American professors cited by People Magazine for excellence in teaching. Prof. Slaughter lec- tured on more than 50 American campuses, as well as in England, Spain, Lebanon, Egypt, Panama, Mexico, and Canada. His expeditions to Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America were sponsored by the Na- tional Geographic Society, Smithsonian Institution, and the Institute for the Study of Earth and Man at SMU. structure of the metal baffled technicians in both labs. While MUFON was conducting its own investigation of the purported UFO crash, the crude sandstone marker on the grave and suspected metal from the grave site were stolen. I reported details in SKYLOOK, (the former name of the Journal) the same year. When Bob Slaughter and his former wife were having lunch at the Ladonia Emporium (Texas), she introduced Bob to Peter Betters, who had just purchased and was restoring a turn-of-the-century home on Main Street. The house had belonged to Ethel McFarland, who was a relative to a friend of Bob's in Dallas, Mike McFarland. In the ensuing conversation, Peter men- tioned a letter that he had found in the house referring to UFO observations made by Mr. Luther Mallow, a gentleman friend of Ethel McFarland. Mr. Betters re- trieved the letter, which was written in 1925, and they transcribed the part dealing with the airship. Quotation from the Letter \"The night of April 16th, 1897, your family's lawyer, E. M. Roland, Colonel R. N. Burt and I were (on) horseback. I was sort of a guide for a frog gigging expedition to the North Sulfur River north of town. Suddenly we saw some very bright lights on the flood- plain some distance away. These lights were far brighter than any I had ever seen (you must remember that the only portable lights in that day were lanterns). We dis- mounted and approached on foot. When we were close enough, we lay between the cotton rows and observed"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 March 1999 MUFON UFO Journal several small \"people\" moving around two well lit cigar-shaped ships. Two of the \"people\" were going back and forth between the ships, while two others worked in the semi-darkness at the edge of the light. We became frightened when the group stopped work- ing and stared in our direction. When they began work- ing again, we slipped away. Return to the site \"The next day we met and returned to the site on horseback. Aside from the cotton being beaten down, all we found were two places side by side where the ground had been disturbed. It looked like two fresh graves. Roland reported the incident that day, naming me and Burt as fellow witnesses. However, he was so ridiculed that Burt talked me into joining him in deny- ing the event. Miffed, but unflinching, Roland changed the location of the sighting to his own property. I sus- pect to profit in some way or to save the graves for his personal exploitation, but he died shortly thereafter. I thought from time to time that I would excavate the graves myself, but after all these years I can't find the exact location.\" The letter continues: \"It was early that next morning (April 17th) that the airship crashed in Aurora, Texas, less than a hundred miles to the west. It could have been one of the ships seen near Ladonia the night before. That afternoon (April 17th), C. L. Mcllhaney, a farmer, reported sighting a cigar-shaped airship on the ground near the Bosque River three miles from Stephenville, Texas. He fetched the mayor of Stephenville, the district attorney, two judges, two medical doctors, and a group of about fifty returned to the site. The group witnessed two small people scurry- ing about, apparently repairing the ship. This could have been the other ship seen near Ladonia the night be- fore.\" Professor Slaughter's discovery Bob Slaughter picks up the story: \"In 1929, the Corps of Engineers straightened the channel of the North Sulfur River, cutting off its meanders to expe- dite runoff during flooding. One result was that it initi- ated rapid down cutting, and today the straightened channel is quite deep, exposing Cretaceous and Pleis- tocene deposits. These are very fossiliferous and at- tract numerous fossil hunters. As the only paleontolo- gist around Ladonia, I often have fossil hunters stop by with bones for identification. One day an avid col- lector, geologist Richard Wallace, brought me the dis- tal end of a fibia (lower leg bone) that looked sort of like a human, but was hollow, not unlike a bird bone. It was not fossilized, and I thought it might be a small deformed Indian, as there are many archeological sites buried in the floodplain. I asked Richard to show me exactly where he had found the bone, and he took me tM r- • y_. Hand has opposed thumb and three fingers. to Davis Creek, a small, but deep, tributary that cuts across the floodplain on its way to the river just north of Ladonia.\" \"Sure enough, we found fragments of more 'modern' bone eroding down the slope and about three feet from the surface was part of another long bone. Rather than tunnel into the bank, I decided to go topside and mark off a square and dig down, in case some- thing would be found that needed to be documented. The burial was almost intact except for the right tibia Richard had found on the slope and most of the right ankle and foot bones disturbed by the creek's erosion. \"When the skull came into sight, I realized that there was a good chance this was the subject of Mr. Mallow's letter to Ethel McFarland. It matches very closely the faces we've all seen drawn after alleged encounters with extraterrestrial beings. The broncos is relatively large. The nasal opening is exceptionally"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal March 1999 PageS Skull features large eyes and sclerotic rings. small, as are the mouth and teeth. The eyes, on the other hand, are huge, and in the sockets are sets of sclerotic rings, bony skeletons supporting the large eyeballs. Throughout the history of animals, very large eyeballs (some birds, fish, and dinosaurs) have devel- oped these eye skeletons to help keep atmospheric or water pressure from collapsing them. All of the bones are hollow, except for the ribs, hand, and foot bones, which are solid. This creature is clearly not human in the strict sense, even though it can be considered homi- noid.\" Professor Slaughter's Analysis Bob Slaughter produced his standard techni- cal report of the skeleton recovery as he has done for other fossils discovered by him around the world: \"Ladonia wallacia, new genus & species\" \"Diagnosis: LU 63444. Large eyes with sclerotic rings. Small mouth and nasals. Long bones very short for their transverse diameters and hollow. The long, at- tenuated hands have an opposed thumb and three equal length fingers which, like the thumb, have but a single finger joint-humans have two. The feet likewise have but four toes, and the 'big toe' is the longest and slightly opposed, perhaps reflecting arboreal ancestry. \"Type locality: The east bank of Davis Creek, four miles north of Ladonia, Texas, 225 yards west of State Highway 34 and 100 yards from the banks of the old Sulfur River channel. (See the map drawn by Bob Slaughter, page 6.) \"Etymology: Ladonia for the town where the remains were discovered + wallacia named for Rich- ard Wallace, discoverer of the skeleton. \"Discussion: The skeleton is wearing a sort of vest made of a material not unlike woven fibers of extruded glass. Also associated is a \"belt\" of metal \"beads.\" The \"beads\" are a series of cradled \"cups\" of at least three types of metal. Considering the oxidation (patina), two are probably different copper alloys, and the other is something like aluminum. Also associated is a tongue-shaped piece of glass. It is clear with a slight bluish tint. It is harder than most glass, but not particularly well produced for such a high-tech soci- ety. Attached is what could only be considered a handle which is made of a copper alloy and is gold plated. This object seems to be independent, and not a part of something else. Its use is unknown. It seems a poor choice of material for a bludgeon. The other possibili- ties that come to mind are a scepter, or other symbol of status, or a unit for communication (i.e. crystal for ra- dio communication). \"By analogy, the relatively large brain may de- note a high degree of intelligence. The large eyes doubt- less denote an evolutionary need for vision in low light levels. The hollow bones could be interpreted as to lighten the body in a high gravity situation (i.e. large planet). I must admit, however, in the absence of any animals evolving in high gravity with which to com- pare, more sturdy bones might be more appropriate to handle the increased physical stress. Hollow bones could then suggest a low gravity habitat (i.e. small planet) with the limb bones having to deal with less physical stress. Whatever the case, these relatively frag- ile long bones would certainly be a disadvantage for a biped on Earth. \"Although right ulna-radius, wrist, and hand bones are missing, as well as right foot bones and the distal end of the right tibia, these are due to erosion of the burial site. No other bones are broken, in spite of their fragility, and there is no other evidence as to what caused its demise. The fact that there probably were two, plus the crash the following morning of one of the space ships at Aurora and the hasty repair of another near Stephenville suggest that the group was having"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Page 6 March 1999 MUFON UFO Journal The sword and belt. some very serious problems.\" My first information regarding the skeleton A telephone call from Wayne Cox of Chatham, LA, alerted me to the existence of Bob Slaughter's book, which Wayne had purchased in a Dallas book store. Mr. Cox followed with a letter and photocopies of the book chapter titled \"Alien.\" I was so intrigued that I immediately tried to telephone Bob Slaughter in Dallas to get more details. When I reached his home, the telephone was answered by Mrs. Judith Slaughter, his widow. Professor Slaughter had died of cancer on March 24, 1998. En route to Denver for the MUFON 1998 In- ternational UFO Symposium, my wife and I stopped in Dallas to visit Judith, a very lovely lady, and to see the skeleton. After taking measurements of the bones and making a drawing of the skeleton, I took numerous photographs to document the case. In addition to the description given by Bob Slaughter in this article, I noted other items of interest. The vest looks more like metal links that a warrior might use for protection. The belt is actually composed of one-inch diameter rings of various kinds of metals threaded around a metal sup- port. The rings will rotate freely. The sword, for a lack of a better name, has a blade of blue/green glass and a ; 'X\" marks the spot where the skeleton was found."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal March 1999 Page? cast silver-colored handle. A very distinguished em- blem adorns the handle (looking like ancient English or German royalty). The sword is probably symbolic or ceremonial, since it doesn't appear to be an effec- tive weapon. Various photographs illustrate this unique skeleton in this article. (A poster display with photo- graphs and drawings is on view at the MUFON UFO Information Center.) Mrs. Slaughter is going to donate the \"alien\" skeleton to MUFON's museum, since she feels that this would have been her husband's desire, due to his UFO interests. Comparison of a small grey to the skeleton MUFON is making no claims that the skel- eton is an extraterrestrial alien; however, I do want to make some comparisons, as did Bob Slaughter. The total height is 39 5/8 inches. The skull has very large eyes, but the skull is not large in proportion to the body. Previous studies of the small greys imply that they do not have teeth, whereas this skeleton has human-style teeth with a very narrow and pointed chin. People have reported from three to six digits on the hands and feet; however, this example has four. The four floating cir- cular bones within each eye socket is extremely inter- esting. The similarities are sufficient to make it very exciting for future study. Investigation Personal investigation of the skeleton for further au- thenticity has been difficult for the following reasons: (1) Judith Slaughter had been married to Bob for only two years prior to his death; therefore, she was not involved when the skeleton was recovered. (2) Even after inquiry in Ladonia, Mrs. Slaugh- ter has been unable to locate Richard Wallace, who found one of the leg bones. (3) Mike McFarland, the friend of Bob Slaughter's in Dallas, is now deceased. (4) Peter Betters, who found the letter to Ethel McFarland from Luther Mallow, now lives in the re- stored \"purple\" house in Ladonia, TX. Judith was un- able to talk to him on her last visit, but will do so in the near future. Motion picture planned Mrs. Judith Slaughter has signed a contract with Sony Pictures for the rights to Bob's book Fossil Remains of Mythical Creatures, so as to produce a motion picture on Professor Slaughter's life. Jim Hart, the scriptwriter for the film \"Contact,\" starring Jodie Foster, will produce the film under the company name Common Grounds Entertainment. Tentatively, Paul Newman will portray Bob Slaughter in the film. The \"alien\" skeleton, along with all of the other fossils and skeletons that Bob Slaughter has collected from around the world, will be featured in the film. As Judith has said, \"The skeleton will be even more famous for MUFON's museum after the film is released.\" The in- vestigation into the identification and origin of the skel- eton will continue. UFO reportedly videotaped in Northern Ireland On Wednesday, Jan. 20, 1999, at 4:50 p.m., Kenneth Mundell stepped out of his home in Inver, a suburb of Larne, Country Antrim, Northern Ireland, and spotted something strange in the eastern sky. Quickly he grabbed his camcorder. \"I noticed the triangular UFO coming from the east just about 1,000 feet high in the sky,\" Mundell reported. \"It was travelling slowly, perhaps 30 to 40 miles per hour. There was no sound coming from the craft.\" As the UFO approached his house, Mundell began recording its image on 8 millimeter XTR (Extra Resolution) videotape. \"When the UFO was directly over my house, it changed direction, shifting to a more northerly one,\" he reported, adding that the UFO seemed to \"'skid' across the sky, an impossible task for any known air- craft. \"-Thanks to UFO Roundup, Vol. 4, No. 7, Jo- seph Trainor, Editor, and to Kenneth Mundell. Triangular UFOs, videotaping, landing reported in South Africa On Friday, Feb. 5, 1999, eight people in Bloemfontein, a large city in the Oranje Vrystaat re- gion of South Africa, watched as several metallic UFO's flew overhead for eight minutes. Witnesses described the UFOs as \"triangular- shaped, greyish-colored objects with brightly-colored lights at the comers.\" One witness reportedly cap- tured \"a couple of minutes\" of the overflight \"on vid- eotape.\" A local newspaper reported on Sunday, Feb. 7,1999, that a UFO had flown over the town of Graaff- Reinette back in December 1998. The same newspa- per also reported that \"a farmer came upon a UFO that had landed on a gravel road near his farm\" in a rural district near Bloemfontein. \"The engine of his truck just cut out, and he was 'frozen' in the act of getting out of the truck. A farm worker who was standing against the fence also could not move. After the UFO left, everything returned to normal. The farmer drove to the nearest police sta- tion, and the police investigated the site.\" Bloemfontein is located 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of Johannesburg.-Thanks to UFO Roundup, Vol. 4, No. 7, Joseph Trainor, Editor, and Leenta Scott."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PageS March 1999 MUFON UFO Journal Possible Israeli mid-air UFO explosion analyzed By Barry Chamish <chamish@netvision.net.il> In December I reported that I had acquired a video copy of a mid-air UFO explosion over the Is- raeli city of Rosh Haayin. I wrote that my impression was that the video captured a profoundly important moment: the first mid-air UFO collision ever recorded. I requested that experts analyze the film scientifically. Within a day, Dwight Connelly of MUFON commit- ted himself to having the video analyzed. The video is a compilation of two UFO events recorded by Spasso Maximovitch in 1995 and 1996.1 sent Dwight both clips and he passed them on to MUFON's video expert, Jeff Sainio, for computer analysis. The following is his report. I will not com- ment on his conclusions. Jeff has no need of my analy- sis of his analysis. Let's just sum matters up like this: It appears to be the real thing. Added to Israel's list of UFO firsts is the first mid-air explosion between two unexplained aerial craft ever captured on videotape or any other media. Several film and TV producers asked me to release the clip for their programs, but I had to turn them down. I am prevented by a copyright problem from reproducing the film, though I am permitted to display my copy. I am seeking a conference to pre- miere this remarkable event. TEXT OF THE MUFON REPORT: By Jeff Sainio MUFON Staff Photoanalyst <jsainio@execpc.com Videoanalysis Events as reported to me by Barry Chamish: \"On 28/9/95, Spasso Maximovitch noticed an unexplainable object in the skies over Rosh Haayin in central Israel. He grabbed his video camera and cap- tured a silvery, glowing object become two, three, and then four fiery orbs in a near square formation over a wide expanse of the northwestern sky. After this inci- dent, Mr. Maximovitch became a constant skywatcher. His dilgence was rewarded on 24/6/96 when a similar silvery orb appeared in the lower western sky. He trained his video camera on the orb... And then a glowing white oval-shaped object appeared some 20 degrees west of the object and streaked toward it at high speed. Within three seconds it struck the station- ary orb, causing a huge explosion in the sky which must have destroyed both objects. Stunned, Maximovitch stopped filming immediately after cap- turing the explosion.\" The submitted video, which was in PAL for- mat, was converted to NTSC format. It shows several events: a group of lights, one apparently dropped from another; a stationary light which is apparently struck by a moving light; and a triangle of lights. The triangle group of lights is interesting, but I could find no basis for investigating-any form of anomalousness. The tri- angle of lights has no ref- erence objects to indicate what or where it is. The stationary light was much more in- teresting. Various lights, probably streetlights, in the video were used as reference objects, and showed that the light was stationary over some 30 seconds. An approaching airplane's landing lights will appear stationary, al- though mbtionlessness over this length of time seems unusual. A verti- cal tower structure, ap- parently made of girders, is near the light. Some horizontal structure is atop the structure. It was not sufficiently defined for continuous measure- ments to be made from it. Another bright object appears to the left and slightly below the stationary object. In 2.9 seconds, it moves toward the stationary object, apparently hitting and exploding. In 1/4 second, the explosion disappears with no trace of either object. The 4-frame sequence above illustrates the se- quence. The bright object can be seen to move between the girders of the vertical structure. This is useful in determining the relative size of the moving light. (The size of the light as seen on the video, is misleading; it is presumably much smaller than what is seen, due to extreme overexposure and glare.) The light disappears or reappears completely 6 times; in 3, the change is"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal March 1999 Page 9 abrupt; completely bright-to-dark or vice versa. In the other 3, the change is gradual, with a frame showing partial brightness. What can be learned from this? One must re- member that the video is a sequence of 1/50 second time exposures. Assume the light is small, and that the moving object has only one light. If by chance, the disappearance coincides with the period between ex- posures, an abrupt disappearance will be seen. A large light, or several lights horizontally separated, will never disappear abruptly while moving slowly. Since six oc- currences form a useful population of samples, the moving light can reliably be said to be quite small. This probably eliminates the flame from a missile as a source. Although the vertical structure was not a reliable ref- erence object, the two lights' relative position could be measured. More than 500 measurements of the two lights' positions were made. The graph at right shows the dis- tance between the 2 lights. Breaks in the data line are due to unreliable data from camera motion or the mov- ing light going behind the girders. Reference straight lines show constant speed. The slopes of the lines show that the moving light spent about a second at some speed, then sped up about 16% before the collision. The 16% is not due to a zoom change; the tower is sufficiently visible to verify that its size does not appreciably change. Although the graph shows noise and missing data, the acceleration certainly occurred in under a second. No reasonable object I know of is capable of a 16% acceleration in a second. When the two objects apparently collide and explode, the apparent size of the light expands by a factor of roughly 2.5; this does not appear to be due to overexposure, but is the real size of the object. The last two frames of the video are NOT overexposed, but diffuse; since overexposure is not involved, this indicates the actual size of the explosion is shown. The real increase in size of the bright area is certainly much larger than 2.5. In the video the explo- sion moves downward; this is probably due to camera motion of the startled videographer; the reference tower is too smeared to verify this conclusion. The explosion is not due to any conventional method I am familiar with; conventional, large explo- sions require much more than 1/4 second to disappear, and usually generate flaming debris that falls from the explosion. Neither characteristic is seen here. The ac- celeration, light size, and explosion are not explain- able in any conventional way that I know of, and this case remains unidentified. 300 W C € (0 o * 2. 0) CO \\ •time (fields), 3sectotal Filer's Files By George Filer MUFON Eastern Director ILLINOIS CAUS thanks Allan Stagg (Allan.Stagg @ABC.com) for this report; \"I was driving home from my overnight job in Chicago in the predawn hours of Thursday, Dec. 17, 1998. I was northbound on the Edens (1-94) about a mile south of the spur to the Tri- State (1-294). At 5:46 a.m. CSTI observed a light that appeared about the intensity of the landing lights on commercial jetliners I often see circling O'Hare in the evenings as I head into town. It seemed no further than a half-mile up and a half-mile away out my wind- shield heading southeast. \"What caught my attention was a second light, about half the intensity of the first, which seemed to come up in a subtle curve from horizon line in the north- east and headed downward toward the southwest, clearly impacting the first light. The impact caused an initial burst of light fol- lowed by a lengthy stream of white sparks trailing the first light as it continued in a southeasterly direction. The second light appeared to fall practically straight down following the collision. I was shocked at what I saw and began to brake, thinking I had witnessed a midair crash between a smaller and larger aircraft. I even looked around at other cars, early risers heading to work, for a reaction of some sort, but traffic contin- (Continued on Page 16)"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Page 10 March 1999 MUFON UFO Journal MUFON FORUM Letters to Mufon UFO Journal Another 'flying peanut'? Following is a letter to Bruce Maccabee from MUFON investigator John Thompson of Georgia: Just got through reading your article in the January issue on the 'Flying peanut'/double UFO video seems to be authentic.\" I must say that a UFO photo taken by a retired police chief and his family in LaGrange, GA, in February 1997 seems to be the exact same UFO. Indeed if you take the dark somewhat superimposed looking church cross away on page 5 in the MUFON UFO Journal, it could be the same photo! I also noticed that you say that the 7/2/98 Ticonderoga, NY, photo was taken by \"upstanding citi- zens of the community...[and] are employed in law- enforcement.\" Another eerie coincidence. A video of the retired police chief telling of his family's sighting along with the UFO photo taken by his wife was sent to Jeff Sainio, Tom Sheets (MUFON of Georgia's present state director), and George Filer in September of 1997. A copy of the photo and report were also sent to Walt Andrus soon after (but not video). If you will go to www.isur.com, you can see the photo and case copy, complete with Jeff's analysis that has been posted since October of 1997. The angle of the UFO image in the MUFON UFO Journal and shown at isur's website is even the same. Now it is possible that both parties saw an air- plane with the wing showing up in the middle, but not seen by any of the witnesses, but two of the LaGrange witnesses said there were two UFOs to begin with and one of them displayed great motion, at great speeds, ruling out an airplane. Their two UFOs \"met\" in an inverted V fashion before one departed and the remain- ing one was photographed. I would love to see a copy of the video taken in New York, complete with audio. In return I'll be glad to send a copy of my witness' interview and photo. Of course, Jeff Sainio and George Filer and Tom Sheets have this also, and I'm sure would give you a copy. I considered this, by the way, as one of my best cases because of the reputation of the witnesses; a retired police chief with a masters degree; his wife; the photographer and working for the State of Geor- gia; and their grown daughter, a former 911 dispatcher and married presently to a LaGrange police sergeant. Also because they said they had an off-duty FBI photoanalyst who examined the photo and declared it a genuine unknown. I'm sure because of the similari- ties of these photos, that Jeff must have brought this up with you in your consultation with him on the NY UFO video. Proving the MJ-12 documents?

Dear Dr. Wood, If Truman, Bush, Einstein, and others authored the Majestic 12 documents, then the methods of fo- rensic-linguistics will conclusively prove it. Several years ago, Dr. Donald Foster of Vassar College de- vised a brilliant statistical method for determining the authorship of a document that he has since applied in dozens of court cases requiring verification of docu- ment authorship. In 1996, Foster successfully pegged Joe Klein as the anonymous author of Primary Colors, the tell- all White House novel. Also, at the request of the FBI, Dr. Foster conclusively verified that Unabomber sus- pect Ted Kaczynski had indeed authored his invective 'manifesto. Foster first gained prominence by successfully applying his technique to solve an age-old mystery sur- rounding the acting roles of Shakespeare. His break- through-hailed by Elizabethan scholars and computer scientists, alike-was to assume that even Shakespeare was prone to linguistic habits which revealed them- selves through statistical comparison. Clearly, Dr. Wood, if you were to apply Dr. Foster's technique to the MJ-12 documents, you will be a giant step closer to conclusively verifying the au- thorship of these intriguing documents. If you're inter- ested, you can contact him at foster@vassar.edu or call Vassar at extension x5634.

Wood and Ryan S. Wood The hunt for a genuine U.S. Government docu- ment that shows the use of MJ-12 is over. The break- through comes from the FOIA effort of Tim Cooper, shown as Figure 1. This document, released by the CIA, is from the Paperclip files, Record Group 330, JIOA files, released Nov. 7, 1985. It is a memo from Hillenkoetter on 12 April 49 to the Joint Intelligence Ob- jectives Agency (JIOA) and the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) that, while otherwise unclassified, shows file dis- tribution to a CIA Top Secret control file and to MJ-12. This is unambiguous evi- dence that there was such a project. To our knowledge, this is the first and only FOIA-released document designating MJ-12. A censor has lined through the distri- bution block, but did not obliterate it. Provenance of the documents We are dealing with documents from multiple sources. In two instances, we have an original. Skep- tics who casually assert that anyone can fake anything, especially with today's computers, are off base. The simple-minded focus by skeptics on provenance is a huge over-simplification of the problems and tech- niques of authentication process. For example, if you are at an antique show and an old English dresser has provenance (records of possession over the years), that can add to the value. An expert recognizes the dresser for what it is and knows what signs to look for as indi- cation that it is a replica, not genuine, with or without the provenance records. The same thing is true in the examination of questioned documents. We recognize that the provenance is relevant. Documents with the caveat MAJIC, Majestic, or MJ-12 have been around since 1984 with the release of the Eisenhower Briefing Document in 1987 by Bill Moore. Since then, other documents have emerged under dif- ferent circumstances. A summary of their provenance is given in Table 1. There are five different sources for the Majestic documents. Background of document evaluation From time to time Bob Wood corresponded with Stanton Friedman, who was very good about send- ing his research conclusions and passing on leads. Then, towards the end of December 1994, Stan requested permission from Don Berliner to let Bob have a look 12 APR 1949 OQSCTOf, JODIT EJirLLEiSllCB OSJECTTOS iOEiCJ.

Don had circulated SOM among a very limited group with the purpose of determining au- thenticity. In an attempt to read the words more clearly, he carefully keystroked the manual. Later, Don gra- ciously lent his very best copies, and Bob made photo- graphic enlargements of those and continued the repli- cation of this manual. While doing this, Bob analyzed the factors that would determine fake versus genuine. Stan decided to include part of the SOM in his 1996 book, Top Secret/MAJIC. While the publication had the positive aspect of reducing the secrecy of the document, the negative aspect was that the replication by the publisher was done carelessly, and included no discussion of authenticity. Because of this publication, a witness came forward to say that he had shredded both the EBD and SOM 1-01 while working in an admiral's office. The publication also led to Brian Parks finding identical UFOB reporting words in an 'FOIA document. Then Stan sent Bob material that he received from Timothy Cooper, who said he had been receiving new documents in his post office box in Big Bear Lake, CA, beginning in 1992. Timothy already was a highly qualified, innovative UFO researcher, having filed many FOIA requests successfully, and had written a fasci- nating 300-page summary of what happened at White Sands Proving Ground (WSPG) in the summer of 1947. He also was the source of at least two of Len Stringfield's 1991 crash/retrieval reports. Stan Fried- man spent many hours on the phone with Tim Cooper, concluding that several of his document copies prob- ably were authentic in their original forms. Stan then contacted Bob, who lives in Southern California, urg-"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Page 12 March 1999 MUFON UFO Journal ing him to visit with Timothy for closer evaluation. On Sept. 24, 1996, Bob and his wife Charlotte met with Tim Cooper in his home at Big Bear Lake, CA. Tim said that he had communicated with leading people in the UFO field, but said, \"You are the first person who ever took enough interest to come and see me.\" That first meeting was preliminary, and Tim had many things he wanted to say. He showed a copy of his 1947 WSPG piece and some of the source mate- rial. Bob's interest in getting to the source material and getting past Tim's interpretation of what might have happened, even if it were correct, caused us to focus more on the papers obtained in the mailbox from his source, Thomas Cantwheel. Tim shared his reported unsuccessful attempts to learn the real identity of Cantwheel. Stan had sent us part of the Cooper- Cantwheel collection. In subsequent visits Tim provided better cop- ies and hunted through his files and found new docu- ments Stan had not yet seen. Tim's filing system was not well-organized, understandably, given the tens of thousands of pages of FOIA material. In the meantime, Bob's son and partner, Ryan S. Wood, expressed increasing interest in this subject. Ryan had had an independent decade-long interest in UFOs, and took the initiative to suggest that we might have the material and the skill to write a book. We became increasingly confident that the SOM 1-01 in its original form was genuine, having dealt satisfacto- rily and accurately with early objections to its authen- ticity. We became a partnership team, and told both Tim and Stan that was our plan, and sought permission for selective use of the Cooper-Cantwheel collection for a book proposal. As a result, Ryan and Bob visited with Tim three more times, each time with focused questions, and each time leaving with more insight. Fake versus genuine? We had been thoroughly exposed to the au- thentication discussions surrounding the Eisenhower Briefing Documents and the attendant-and often not constructive-criticism the participants piled upon each other. It seemed to us that since all reasonable students have now concluded that there was a covert program by the U.S. to study and exploit UFOs, documentation of such a program is properly assumed to exist. The question is, were we looking at real documents or at faked and disinforming documents? This problem is very analogous to one that Bob worked on during his earlier career with McDonnell Douglas: \"How do you tell the difference between a reentry vehicle (RV) with a real warhead and a decoy designed to fool radar? The details are classified, but the principle was to establish \"discriminants,\" mea- sure their values, and compare the numbers with those expected for RVs and for decoys. Statistically, the an- swer pops out: \"the probability is ten to the minus three that is a real RV.\" To use a technique like this, one rums to docu- ment authentication methods used by professional ques- tioned document examiners. Whether one is trying to authenticate someone's will, the Dead Sea Scrolls, or old UFO records, the techniques and principles are known, proven and applicable. Generally, they are (1) provenance, (2) assessment of original (3) typography and chirography (including signatures), (4) chronol- Table 1.

By anal- ogy, these are five \"discriminants.\" Bob embraced this systematic methodology relative to SOM 1-01. The overwhelming conclusion, based on four years of work, was that this is a com- pletely genuine document published for its stated pur- poses. We have an array of evidence in each of the five categories above that put the conclusion of a fake in a \"wishful thinking\" pile. Clearly genuine The authenticity of SOM 1 -01 could be a topic of another article later. Such an article would clearly show the reasons why this document is clearly genu- ine in its original form. One row of Table 4, to be dis- cussed later, summarizes arguments for SOM 1-01's authenticity. We have dealt in detail with the five main criticisms of the SOM 1-01 in the available videotape and CD-ROM. (Order at 800-845-2151). Table 2 shows thirteen documents of the Cooper-Cantwheel collection to which was also have applied discriminants in particular and the QD exami- nation method in general. Our book, The Majestic Documents, assembles the documents in chronological order and includes leg- ible replicas of the original. In one case (25 Sep 47 Humelsine to Truman) similar language or phrases were available before the date of the document. This has caused naysayers to argue that they were surely faked. This \"favoring fakery\" as a principle of document au- thentication can not work unless one wishes to main- tain a preconceived notion of what the answer should be. A fake document determination is incomplete un- less accompanied by a rationale supporting fakery. Who was the target? What evidence supports a faker's mo- tivation, means, and opportunities? The question of faking Detractors claim that almost anything can be faked with the right software, and that the UFO records include many examples of faked documents. This is unsupportable on two counts: first, software tools would have to be available prior to the arrival of the docu- ment; second, where and what are examples of such faked documents? A careful analysis of the typography, for ex- ample, shows that the famous Truman-Forrestal memo was created with a 1940 Underwood Standard-cer- tainly not a computerized fake. We may suspect that \"The Aquarius Documents\" are fake, but to our knowl- edge they have not undergone a detailed investigation and were never claimed to be anything more than a re-type. We have shown, for example, that the Special Operations Manual includes, amongst other indicators, a few examples of a \"raised z\" that virtually guaran- tees the manual was prepared with a hot lead Monotype printing machine of the period (1954). We always rec- ognize that the faker could recondition an old machine, train an operator for several years to use it, slavishly follow the 1953 Style Manual for format, and voila! we have the fake. Generally, our analyses are oriented not to be absolute and unequivocal, but to show that the faker would have had to have access to equipment, knowledge, and sophistication levels that just become unbelievable. In each of the categories, an examiner looks for discriminants and uses them to assess genuineness vs. fakery. The mere existence of one indicator of fak- ery (for example, a seemingly incorrect classification stamp) should never be enough to swing the conclu- sion, inasmuch as it, for one example among several, is not a discriminant by itself. The skeptics speak Over the years, Ryan and Bob have interacted selectively with other researchers whose goal, like ours, was to determine whether the documents were authen- tic or not. A list of these helpful people is mentioned in our CD-ROM and on our web site. Each usually fo- cused on a specialized aspect of authenticity for a par- ticular document at issue. These colleagues provided about 50 skeptical questions and concerns. Recently, as part of Mr. Joseph Firmage's Project Kairos Website (www.TheWordIsTruth.org) we chose to leverage his efforts and provide our docu- ments in support of his vision. The Internet publica- tion was alive with quick reaction criticisms and com- pliments. A recent critical review is found in a publi- cation edited by Barry Greenwood. After deleting the cynical comment, rhetorical questions, and ad hom- inem arguments, we concluded that there were a few authenticity concerns raised that would interest all. Table 3 summarizes these concerns and provides the necessary clarity. The 1 st Annual Report discusses period issues, including biological warfare. This draft uses the then-coined word \"retro-virus,\" discussed in Table 3. The whole report is a casual draft, not a finished re- port. These drafter education and specialties inclined them to excessive use of hyphenization and word con- ing, typical of bureaucracies. \"Retro-virus\" is but one among many, such as other-world, one-hundred, bio-medical, multi-layers, over-all, stand-by, micro-circuitry, low-power, electro-magnetic, high-temperature, electro- hydrody- namic, super-aerodyne, out-weighed, inter-active, mid-air, rocket-plane, X-plane, body-bag, air-borne, south-westernly, air-sea, near-miss, right-angle, and low-level.

Generally, we think that it is likely that all eight pages of the EBD contain genuine material. Also, the Truman-Forrestal memo included as Attach- ment A appears genuine, given the 1940 Underwood Standard determination and the Truman signature ac- complished by use of a pantograph (a mechanical pen with one master driving several slave pens), thereby explaining the similarity to the Truman-Bush signature a week later. Likewise, there is no reason to suspect the titles of the attachments, since one of them also appears in the Special Operations Manual, and another is thought to be the Preliminary Analytical Report of 19 Sep 47. None of the other attachments were included. There are, however, inconsistencies in content with the new MJ documents. For example, the EBD says we recovered four EBEs, when our other docu- ments say five. It claims that the propulsion unit was completely destroyed in the wreckage, when it is clear that we dissected it in detail, One clear reason and motivation for a fake document might have been to try to mislead the Soviets in 1984 (the date of the leak) into believing that we had not learned anything about how they work; when, in fact, by then we probably had been smashingly successful in the reverse engi- neering process. So we imagine that this CIA disinformation operation would be consistent with try- ing to influence the KGB via the innocent UFO com- munity. We cannot yet prove this, because the other possibility is that the EBD authors decided to not tell Ike the complete story at that time. After all, he wasn't President yet. Conclusions Although not extensively discussed above, the authenticity of the Special Operations Manual (SOM 1-01) in its original form is assured. The rationale for this conclusion is partially discussed on our CD-ROM, and will be more fully stated in our upcoming book. Table 4 identifies subtleties associated with nine docu- ments that strongly favor authenticity of the originals. Detailed discussion of these points is well beyond the scope of this short article, but anyone with the docu- ments, our CD-ROM, or Web site access can be able to follow the logic. Increasing fine determination of authentication is forecast to continue. This is just the beginning of the data for the public. There is mounting evidence that the Majestic program was the real thing, and that these documents show it. We have several additional docu- ments and analyses that we will be presenting in our forthcoming book. Until then, the best available au- thentication discussion is available free on the Web site (www.TheWordIsTruth.org), or by purchasing our CD-ROM at 800-845-2151. Filer's Files...

New Russian stealth fighter uses plasma The Keldysh Research Center in Russia has reportedly developed new technology allowing a dra- matic decrease in an aircraft's radar observability. The Russian approach to low observability (LO) technol- ogy is completely different from the US Stealth, and offers complete surreptitious movement of the protected object at a significantly lower price. An exclusive interview about these technolo- gies was conducted by Nicolai Novichkov, ITAR- TASS, with the director of the Center, Anatoliy Korteev. The American approach to LO (Stealth tech- nology) applied on B-2, F-117A, and the fifth genera- tion fighter F-22 \"Raptor\" is based on designing the airframes and radiation absorbing materuls to mini- mize their radar cross section. The main drawbacks of the Stealth technology are its negative effects on the flight and agility of the stealth aircraft. Russian scientists approach the issue from the other direction. They proposed to create a plasma for- mation around the protected object which prevents ra- (Continued on Page 19)"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal March 1999 Page 17 Update on deciphering Gen. Ramey letter By Donald R. Burleson, Ph.D. Since my last communication I have made con- siderable progress with reading the Ramey letter, and am glad to see from recent issues of the Journal that others are making inroads as well. I have been using four different image-enhancement computer software packages, and I would estimate that I have reached at least tentative readings of around 80 percent of the text at this point. While there is too much detail to go into here (I am giving a detailed presentation on the Ramey let- ter at the International UFO Museum and Research Center here in Roswell on April 10 for anyone inter- ested and able to attend), I wanted to pass along a few points. For one thing, it would seem that very little had been deciphered heretofore of what I call the \"shadowline,\" the first visible (but barely visible) line of type at the horizontal fold near the top of the docu- ment. By using certain image-stretching techniques, I have been able to coax the shadowline into greatly improved visibility. The first grouping, near Gen. Ramey's thumb, seems to start with RECO- (one has to be careful to avoid subjectively jumping to conclu- sions, but the word RECOVERY comes to mind). The next group is evidently some word ending in -ATION; this is difficult, but the word looks most like OPERATION, though in some imagings it nearly appears to end in -VATION or -MATION. The follow- ing short word looks like WITH, and the group after that is ROSWELL. Under high zoom and optimal conditions of contrast, the word following that appears to be DISK (the spacing appears a little irregular). Then follows a three-character group of numerals, apparently either 074 or 274. The group following that, again under im- proved imaging conditions, is a five-character group (with some uncertainty as to possible spacing) clearly starting with MJ and ending with D. The shadowline ends with AT (or AS) THE. As Stanton Friedman has mentioned, the light- ing on the paper is uneven, and in particular I would point out that there is a \"flashbulb zone\" near the top-left, so the farther one goes from this zone, into shadow, the trickier it all gets. I should mention too that in the line below the shadowline, with regard to the word I had trouble with before, looking superficially like MAJ--, under better imaging the M turns out to be W and the fifth letter turns out to be K, and the most likely reading is (FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE) WRECK. I note that Don Schmitt has recently, and independently, arrived at the reading WRECK for this grouping as well. At the end of line 8, the grouping before CREWS turns out to be DENVER, and one may note that in 1947 Lowry Army Air Field in Denver was the mortuary center for the Army Air Force; in fact Gen. Exon once remarked to Kevin Randle that he thought one of the alien bodies had been taken to Denver, so this may be an interesting connection. Following DENVER CREWS, with reference to the printed signature TEMPLE, I am indebted to my ENMU colleague, Dr. Henry Monteith, for informing me that in 1947 there was a Maj. Temple on the staff of Gen. James Doolittle; since Doolittle seems already to have been involved in UFO-related matters by 1946, this seems to suggest yet another interesting connec- tion, at least if this Temple is the same person. There is more, but you can see that the letter is yielding up its secrets at a good pace. What is impor- tant now is that those of us who have made the most intense effort and have had the most success in read- ing the Ramey letter must correlate all our indepen- dent findings to arrive at a clear consensus. I feel that we are close to that already. In any case, it is amusing to revisit the Air Force's July 1994 statement (in the Weaver report) to the effect that there is nothing legible on the paper in the Ramey-DuBose photo. This is baloney, pure and simple. We are on the threshold of announcing that the cover-up is over. Daylight silver disc seen over Toronto On Wednesday, Feb. 3, 1999, at 10:15 a.m., aircraft engineer Garfield Bowser was at the corner of St. George and Bloor Streets in Toronto, the largest city in Canada, when he spied a very large UFO cross- ing the sky. Bowser reported that he \"saw a wingless, noiseless, three-hundred-foot-long, fifty-foot-high ob- ject with a 'nubin' on top. It was over St. Clair Avenue West a little beyond Casa Loma.\" He estimated that the object \"was traveling at about 400 miles per hour. No tail fin. Elevation 15 de- grees from horizontal. Altitude 10,000 feet, descend- ing to 8 degrees from horizontal two-and-a-half miles to the nonh li was very silvery, with pointy-rounded ends and a black horizontal band around it, against a very clear blue sky. \"Having been in the aircraft industry for five years and having an eye and ear for engines, this ob- ject is unlike any craft I have observed heretofore,\" Bowser stated. -Thanks to UFO Roundup, Vol. 4, No. 7, Jo- seph Trainor, Editor, and to Errol Bruce-Knapp."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Page 18 March 1999 MUFON UFO Journal Cynthia Hind The UFO PRESS LiFOs Over Africa by Cynthia Hind, Horus House Press, Inc., Madison, WI, 1997. Reviewed by Dwight Connelly Cynthia Hind is a veteran researcher who has earned the respect of ufologists all over the world. Her first book, UFOs-African En- counters, published in 1982, gave many readers their first look at ufology in the Dark Con- tinent. This latest book broad- ens and updates her research in this exciting pan of the world. Unlike some authors, Cynthia carries out her own research. Not only are the reports more accurate, but they are also more interesting as she adds informa- tion and impressions concern- ing the locales and the people involved. Those seriously interested in a complete pic- ture of ufology would do well to pick up this book, since African cases are somewhat different from those in the U.S. or Europe, due to the differences in cul- tures. Cynthia notes that \"none of the [native Afri- cans] interviewed treated their experiences as particu- larly unusual. It was always something they associ- ated with the spirits of their ancestors, a tribal anomaly which did not surprise or confuse them. Although they were often frightened by it, as the spirits were not al- ways friendly, they could always run away and hide, or make some attempt to avoid contact. But 1 could not say there was overwhelming fear.\" Those who have read Bob Pratt's book, UFO Danger Zone, can appreciate how different Africa is from Brazil, where UFOs have caused widespread in- jury and terror. Even though Africa has become modernized in many ways, Cynthia notes that there is considerable lack of information about UFOs. This, combined with a shortage of investigators and the usual fear of ridi- cule, has limited the number of important cases com- ing out of that continent. Even so, various interesting cases are covered in this latest book, many involving native Africans. One fascinating case, however, involves an instrument en- gineer from Britain. One night near Christmas time in 1951, \"Henry\" was driving near his home not far from Cape Town when he was suddenly surprised by an in- dividual in an off-white lab coat motioning for him to stop. Short in stature and speaking English with a strange accent, this individual said he badly needed a quantity of water. Henry drove him to a stream where they filled a container. On the return trip Henry was directed to drive off the road a bit, coming upon an object about 30-35 feet wide and about 12 feet high. Henry was asked to follow the individual he had assisted, and did so, ap- prehensive, but with a compulsion to accompany him. Entering the object by climbing a short ladder, Henry found that one of the other individuals in the object was either sick or had been hurt. He was told the individual had been injured when a window of the craft had broken when entering the Earth's atmosphere, but Henry saw no broken window. Henry offered to call a doctor, but the offer was refused. He was later able to describe the interior in detail. Henry was told that propulsion was achieved by running liquid through pipes to annul the force of gravity. He left without incident and returned home. At work the next day he was berated by his boss for telling about his experience. African abductions are also described by Cynthia, although she says that she has \"always been ambivalent about abductions. I believe that what the abductees are reporting is the truth; that it is certainly a horrifying reality to them, where their will and their bodies are no longer their own. I also think that it is highly possible that there are creatures visiting us who are subjecting certain people to these often terrifying experiences. What I am worried about is whether it is a physical reality, or an experience taking place in an altered state of consciousness, where only the mind is involved.\" This is a valuable, interesting book by a re- spected researcher who gives a unique African per- spective to the UFO anomaly. UFOs...The Real Story, by Stanton Friedman, CD ROM multi-media. Unity Publishing 1996. $20 pp from Friedman at 79 Pembroke Cresc., Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada, E3B 2VI Reviewed by Dwight Connelly Stanton Friedman, considered by many to be the dean of UFO researchers, has produced an excel- lent multi-media device offering compelling evidence that UFOs are real. As such, it is perhaps more appro- priately directed at the uninitiated, rather than at those who already know the field. There is, however, a great deal of material that should be of interest to even the more experienced ufologists. The editorial thrust-or, some would say, bias- is from Stan's perspective. This is not necessarily a criticism, since few people in the field have done more"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal March 1999 Page 19 £••- research over more aspects of ufology than Friedman. There are basically two main segments to this CD: a general look at the field, including such things as abductions and crashes, and a segment on Santilli's \"alien autopsy\" film. The overall look at UFOs is well done and rea- sonably comprehensive, although Friedman wisely lim- its his coverage to cases that he feels he knows some- thing about. In characteristic fashion, Stan methodically looks at the evidence, care- fully building the case that UFOs are real. The alien autopsy seg- ment considers the claims by Santilli, then discusses each significant question which arises from the film, such as whether the aliens have the correct appearance (based on the testimony of other wit- nesses to alleged crashes), whether the bodies were real Stanton Friedman or created by special effects, the mystery surrounding the alleged cameraman, etc. He concludes that, while it can not be proven that the film was faked, the evi- dence points in that direction. The organization of this CD is very good. Under \"UFOs the Real Story\" are Conclusions, Ob- jections, Who believes?, Technology, Galactic neigh- borhood, Destination Earth, Where are they from?, Crashes, Cover-up, and Have you seen a UFO? There is a handy graphic index to the various topics and sub- topics, making it fairly simple to quickly find what you want. The search feature, however, seemed somewhat poor. I tried searching for Betty Hill, for example, and came up empty, even though there is material concern- ing Betty Hill on the CD. Perhaps one of the more interesting parts of the CD are the video clips, which can be accessed at various points throughout the presentation. These in- clude everything from testing the soil from the Delphos, KS, landing site to Betty Hill telling about her abduc- tion. These alone may be worth the price of the CD. Another feature is the ability to enlarge many of the photos by clicking on them. As an interesting aside, there are some nostalgic clips of present-day research- ers as they worked or were interviewed 20 years or so ago, such as the youthful Ted Phillips at Delphos. (Ted has recently returned to Delphos, by the way.) Overall, the production is excellent. A couple of minor annoyances was the variation in sound level from segment to segment, as well as the necessity to scroll every time a return was made to the lower por- tion of the photo list. There is a section which features references, with comments by Friedman in some cases concern- ing what he thinks about the material referenced. An- other section features specific questions which can be clicked on, resulting in specific video, answers from Stan. A nice final touch is the instruction to report sightings to MUFON This CD has much to recommend it, and MUFON groups might want to consider purchasing it for their lending libraries so more people-especially prospective members-can have access to it. Since it is basically a we 11-researched, non-sensauonal look at ufology, it would also be suitable for placing in public and high school/college libraries. Filer's Files...

An artifi- cially created plasma cloud surrounds the plane and reportedly guarantees a decrease of more than 100 times in its observability. The cloud interacts with electromagnetic waves radiated by enemy radar. First, an absorption of elec- tromagnetic energy occurs in the cloud, since during plasma penetration it interacts with plasma-charged particles, passes onto them a portion of its eneigy, and fades. Second, due to specific physical processes, the electromagnetic wave tends to pass around the plasma cloud. Both of these phenomena result in a dramatic decrease of the reflected signal. Static and flight experiments reportedly proved the effectiveness of this technology. The first genera- tion devices, which produce a plasma field surround- ing the aircraft and decrease the reflected signal, were created in the Center. Later, a method of creating sec- ond generation advanced systems (capable of not only decreasing reflected signal and changing its wavelength, but also producing some false signals) was discovered. Such systems significantly complicate determination of an actual aircraft's speed and location, and leads to development of completely new approaches to LO, unachievable with conventional Stealth technology. Furthermore, the weight of the systems devel- oped in Russia do not exceed 100 kg, and power con- sumption ranges from kilowatts to tens of kilowatts. Advances in development of the third generation are on the new MIG 29. Thanks to: Anatoliy Korteev. 26/ 01/99 (c) ITAR-TASS, Translation by Philip Kaploun.

The \"Phoenix Lights\" revisited by Bruce Maccabee are a good example of this, but so are the \"Case of the Month\" and Beverly Trout's reported abduction experiences. Interpretations of com- plex events can be somewhat subjective; even thorough inves- tigation often can fail to pinpoint a definite answer. So we have to learn lo live with a \"tolerance for ambiguity \" The February issue also illustrates a commendable determination to try to find an- swers. Kudos to Maccabee for his impressively thorough analy- Richard Hall sis, and for his suggestion on how to settle the issue once and for all: conduct an announced flare drop, and let it be thoroughly observed and filmed. If only the authorities would cooperate, this would provide a de- finitive test and no doubt help to demystify at least some of the Phoenix events. But military authorities all too often seem to have a stake in secrecy and mys- tification, rather than cooperating with civilians who want credible answers. They should take a lesson from the French and Belgian governments when it comes to UFOs. An important lesson for MUFON investigators (and readers) to learn is that, in any given location, real UFO sightings often breed proportionally more false sightings in various \"contagious\" ways. This was certainly true of Gulf Breeze, apparently true of Phoe- nix, and there are innumerable precedents in earlier UFO history. People hear about the sightings, rush outdoors to see for themselves, and are astonished to discover funny lights in the sky. Often they do not have a sophisticated knowledge of all the things in the sky that would be visible any time they looked; they just haven't paid attention. So false UFO reports are gen- erated. Weather and lighting conditions also can dis- tort the images of sky lights, making them appear \"too large\" or \"too bright\" to be something familiar. Atmo- spheric distortion can alter the appearance of glowing objects: that is why stars twinkle. A very common er- ror is to assume that because a light is very bright, it must be closer than it really is. This honest error oc- curred in Phoenix, and one false assumption can throw off all your calculations. Maccabee's careful, objec- tive investigation shows how to sift through various types of observations and data and analyze them mean- ingfully. The brightness/nearness illusion occurs all the time with \"fireball\" meteors. I have seen two of them. Aside from being \"too bright\" and \"too long-lasting\" to be a meteor (true for typical \"shooting star\" mete- ors which fit the stereotype, but not of \"fireballs\"), they look just like a plane on fire, crashing in the next field over. But they really are hundreds of miles away. Since \"fireballs\" are relatively uncommon, the average person tends not to be aware of them. Unlike typical meteors (tiny chunks of space debris), \"fire- balls\" are relatively large chunks that burn up spec- tacularly from friction as they enter the atmosphere, and typically have a luminous \"trail\" streaming behind them. Since they are larger, they last longer: on the order of 8 to 15 seconds. IFOs tend to clutter up the data base and to mislead people about \"real\" UFOs, those that perform in distinctly abnormal ways and defy identification even after thorough investigation. Therefore, it is vi- tally important for people to recognize them and weed them out. Carl Feindt sets another good example of how to go about it. These investigations help both to identify false sightings and, importantly in the long run, to establish an ever growing reliable data base of anomalous events that cry out for scientific attention.

This imposing planet lies only 3 degrees below the Pleiades star cluster on the llth and 12th. It is near the crescent Moon on April 18. Also see \"The Stars\" below. Retrograding from Libra into Virgo this month, Mars brightens to magnitude -1.7 at opposition oppo- site the Sun) on the 24th. On that date the red planet rises in the ESE at sunset and remains visible all night. Since its tiny disc is large enough (16\" of arc) at this time for fruitful study, observers with telescopes can discern a small but bright north polar cap against the orange-tinted desert regions. Mars is nearest Earth on May 1 at a distance of 53.8 million miles. The plariet lies near the gibbous Moon on the night of April 2-3. Saturn (0.1), moving from Pisces to Aries, can be glimpsed low in the W at dusk only during the first week of April, setting then about 8 p.m. daylight time. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars shifts westward across the southern sky during the night. During the first half of the month, it stands in the SW at dawn. Later in April the ruddy world sets about sunrise. Meteor Shower: The swiftly moving Lyrids achieve their maxi- mum on the morning of the 22nd, a peak of about 15 per hour toward dawn. Though the quarter Moon in- terferes during the 1st half of the night, after about 2 a.m. the sky is moonless and affords a fine view of this annual meteor display. Some of these bright white meteors can be glimpsed for a few nights before and after the peak.

Look for the constellation's familiar Sickle, which de- fines the lion's head and mane. The bright star in the Sickle's handle is Regulus, the heart of the beast. Far- ther to the E (left) lies Denebola, the lion's tail. With the Big Dipper so favorably placed high in the N, use its pointer system to guide you to other spring star patterns. Dubhe and Merak on the end of the dipper's bowl point downward nearly to Polaris the North Star. Megrez and Phad on the other end of the bowl aim in the opposite direction to Regulus in Leo. The curve of the dipper's handle \"arcs to Arctu- rus,\" the bright orange star in kite-shaped Bootes the Herdsman. If the curve is extended, you can \"speed to Spica\" in Virgo the Maiden.

The cover design should reflect the symposium theme, \"Transcending Politics and Com- fort Zones in Ufology.\" In addition to the theme, it must include the wording \"MUFON 1999 INTERNA- TIONAL UFO SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS,\" the location, \"ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA, and the sym- posium dates, \"July 2-4.\" The contest submissions must be \"camera ready\" and not simply attractive designs, symbols, or artwork. The contest prizewinner will re- ceive $100 in cash plus $100 in MUFON publications or merchandise. Please submit entries to Walt Andrus, the Symposium Proceedings co-editor. The deadline for cover designs is April 1, 1999. LOSS OF STATE SECTION DIRECTOR Corinne A. Elliott, B.A. (Helena, MT) passed away unexpectedly on Dec. 27, 1998. In addition to being a State Section Director and Field Investigator for MUFON, Corinne had diversified talents in the fields of art, music, writing, and raising three daugh- ters. She was recognized in \"Who's Who in American Writers\" and \"Who's Who in American Women.\" Mrs. Elliott joined MUFON in 1993. She will be missed by everyone, but especially by Ronald Penrod, Montana State Director. U. S. NAVAL OBSERVATORY INFORMATION David McManus (Ocean Shores, WA), a Field Investigator, has found a useful website that can be used in investigations and in filing UFO sighting re- ports. A person may obtain the following information: (1) sunrise, sunset, moonrise, moonset and twilight; (2) Moon illumination; (3) eclipses; (4) positions of the Sun and Moon; (5) data for major Solar Systems bodies and bright stars, (6) dates of Earth's seasons; (7) miscellaneous, and (8) DOD Information by con- tacting the website https://aa.usno.navy.mil/AA/data/ GEORGE REYNOLDS GETS MARRIED On the brighter side, we would like to con- gratulate George Reynolds (Elkton, MD), a State Sec- tion Director in Northeast Maryland, who married Elvira \"Elvie\" Dela Torre on Dec. 8, 1998. As George jokingly said, \"I actually did marry an alien!\" Elvie is from the Philippines and was naturalized in 1983, mak- ing her a legal \"alien.\""},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Page 24 March 1999 MUFON UFO Journal DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE *rtf —'J >- ygfliSKMEiiJ\"'iTi.^ja' >mmM S3&f*\" \"Walter Andrus NEWS FROM AROUND THE NETWORK NEW OFFICERS State Director for Kentucky Scott R. Voight (Elizabethtown) has selected Kathie F. Grimes (Morgantown), presently a State Section Director, to also be the Assistant State Director for Southern Ken- tucky. The following six gentlemen were appointed State Section Directors this past month: Stephen J. Badamo (Lido Beach, NY); Russel Williams (Kempton, IN; John C. Serrette (Russellville, AR); Joseph A. Murek, M.A. (Yuma, AZ); Steve A. Hudgeons, Jr. (Fort Worth, TX); and Robert D. Long (Reading Center, NY). NEW FIELD INVESTIGATORS Kathleen Marden recently announced that the following individuals have passed the Field Investigator's exam: Eric Lewis (Scottsdale, AZ) and Michael R. DeGraff (Austin, TX). Congratulations are extended to these gentlemen As a further incentive to our members to study the Field Investigator's Manual, pass the 100-question exam, and upgrade their investigative techniques, an award will be given. Start- ing April 1, 1999, each person passing the exam will receive not only their new I.D. card as a Field Investi- gator (F.I.), but an attractive blue and white MUFON lapel pin. DEPUTY DIRECTOR, INVESTIGATIONS As a reminder to all State/Provincial Directors, all processed UFO sighting reports should be mailed to Dan R. Wright at 3628 Aragon Drive, Lansing, MI 48906 for entry into MUFON's computer data- base file. State Section Directors, Field Investigators, and members will continue to mail their completed sighting reports to their State or Provincial Director for screening, accompanied with back-up data as per the instructions in the Field Investigator's Manual. Dan has joined the Journal Staff, and is writing a column titled \"MUFON Case Investigation of the Month.\" NEW WESTERN REGIONAL DIRECTOR Nominations for candidates to fill the position of Western Regional Director have been sought in this column in several issues of the Journal to fill the va- cancy created with the expiration of the four-year term of Mrs. Marilyn H. Childs, M.S. (Bothell, WA). Mrs. Childs had elected not to run for a second term due to her employment time constraints. Since the deadline for receiving names of can- didates for the MUFON Board of Directors position has passed (Jan. 30, 1999), the only person nominated was Virgil C. Staff, MA. (Berkeley, CA), State Di- rector for Northern California. Mr. Staff was interested in this position four years ago. The necessity for plac- ing ballots in the March 1999 Journal to all members in the western states for the election now becomes mute since there was only one person nominated. Therefore, Mr. Staff automati- cally assumes the position effec- tive Feb. 11, 1999. Virgil has been a State Section Director and Field In- vestigator, and has served as the State Director for Northern ... .. ~ ff Califomia since 1982. Joining Vir §\" Matt MUFON in 1977, he comes highly qualified. An in- structor in American history and government at Balboa High School in San Francisco, Mr. Staff retired in 1989, thereby allowing him more time for his favorite inter- ests-UFOs and historical railroading. Considering his education and leadership talent,' Mr. Staff will be an asset to the MUFON Board of Directors. Mr. Staff has promoted his former Assistant State Director, Ruben J. Uriarte, M.A., to the position of State Director for Northern California, effective im- mediately. Ruben joined MUFON in 1990 and has served as a Field Investigator and State Section Direc- tor. Mr. Uriarte has been employed by Highland Gen- eral Hospital in Oakland as their Health Care Service Officer since 1981. MUFON 1999 UFO SYMPOSIUM Mrs. Susan Swiatek, Coordinator for the MUFON 1999 International UFO Symposium, has pro- vided a current status report for the thirtieth MUFON annual symposium. It will be held at the Hyatt Regency Crystal City, 2799 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arling- ton, VA 22202 near the renamed Ronald Reagan Na- tional Airport on July 2, 3, and 4, 1999. The theme of the '99 Symposium is \"Transcending Politics and Com- fort Zones in Ufology,\" which is quite fitting due to the proximity of Washington, D.C., just across the Potomac (Continued on Page 23)"}]
