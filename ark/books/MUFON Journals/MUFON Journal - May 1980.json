FROM THE EDITOR MUFON has decided to assemble a special publication'on reported abductions of human beings by 'alien' beings. Due to the length and complexity of investigation reports already on hand, the cases do not lend themselves to adequate treatment in the Journal without severe condensation. A number of intriguing cases have been submitted, but most would practically fill an issue of. the Journal if fully reported. Therefore, this is a call for manuscripts — especially investigation reports, but newspaper stories and other references will provide useful supplementary information. We would like to concentrate on 1970's cases and to publish as strong a sample, of them as possible. The publication will provide a handy reference volume for anyone desiring to know the types of events that have been reported, what investigation has been accomplished, and the patterns — if any — that they show. Such a volume could help analysts to evaluate this burgeoning problem and to decide where it stands on the list of investigative priorities. American and other investigators world-wide are requested to submit case histories in a form suitable for publication.

By Keith Basterfield -, '  (MUFON Representative for South Australia) There have been at least six reported UFO observations from observers in aircraft over Australasia within the last 2 years. Two made major headlines around the world, namely the Valentich 1 (Victoria, Oct. 21,1978) and the New Zealand 2 (Dec. 1978) aircraft/ radar/visual/film cases, and I will not review these here. Four other observations have been reported of unusual objects in the sky worthy of bur attention. These reports are Goondiwindi 3 (Queensland, 1977); Kunanurra 4 (Northern Territory, 1977); Port Augusta 5 (South Australia, May 1978); and Whyalla 6 (South Australia, Dec. 1978). Investigations are still continuing into the last named. Goondiwindi The reporter was travelling as a passenger on a B.P.A. trilander flying between Cunnamulla and Brisbane in Queensland, when the incident occurred at about 3 a.m. on Sept. 10, 1977. Mr. H was sitting next to the pilot of the trilander when approaching the Goondiwindi airport; both noticed what they first took to be another aircraft approaching on a similar but opposite course. The pilot confirmed through air traffic control (Brisbane and Sydney) that no other traffic was known to be in the area as they made their final approach to land. As the aircraft and the unknown were on what appeared to be an eventual collision course, the trilander pilot took evasive action and Mr. H on the starboard side saw the unknown approach the airport, pass low over the runway, and move away to a position SW of the runway. They landed, but while refuelling they observed that the object \"hovered\" and \"moved about erratically\" to the SW. Meanwhile Mr. H in discussing the object with waiting passengers found they had seen it pass soundlessly at low altitude over the runway. Half an hour later the B.P.A. flight continued on to Brisbane. Sitting once again by the.pilot, as they ascended, Mr. H watched the unknown move toward the aircraft, then pace it at a similar rate of speed on the starboard side, before it turned away from the plane in a SE direction, disappearing into the distance. Mr. H said that at no time was any shape discernible, only two bright lights positioned above and below (at an angle) what seemed to be a \"thick-body.\" The \"lights\" were not the usual type .fitted to aircraft, being described as • changing color from orange to white in a \"psychedelic\" manner. The incident was apparently not reported to any authority. Kunanurra At 5:30 p.m. on Dec. 9,1977, a Mr. Lindsay McKenzie-Smith and his wife Helen were flying in a light aircraft at a position approximately 100 km east of Kunanurra, Northern Territory (some 370 km SSW of Darwin). The plane was piloted by Mr. McKenzie-Smith who had 750 hours flying experience. On that day they had already made several flights within the NT since Starting at about 9:30 a.m. that morning, and were on their way from Legune to Victoria River Downs (VRD). The terrain in the area is extremely rugged and isolated, and both people were feeling tired after commencing this last leg at about 4:30 p.m. The aircaft, a Cessna 206, was cruising at 1,675 meters, just after passing over the Pinkerton Ranges (300-340 m high), when Helen McKenzie-Smith told her husband that another aircraft was coming towards them. Helen estimated that she first noted the \"object\" when it'was about 5 km distant, flying at a lower altitude below the visible horizon. It was easily picked up against the green-brown background. Both of them logically expected the \"object\" to be a plane but realized it wasn't as it approached. The object passed below and behind the plane at an estimated 1,370 m (making it aboutSOO m below them). In order to observe it further the pilot banked the aircraft approximately 90°, but upon turning, the ^object had apparently disappeared from sight. The plane then continued on its former course and within 5 minutes of the observation attempted to report its position as is normal practice at this stage of the flight. (They also planned to ask if there was'any traffic in the area). Mr. _ McKenzie-Smith tried several times but could not transmit on VHP or HF for the next 20-30 minutes. He eventually raised Darwin (VHF) before approaching and landing at VRD. The object appears to have come no less than 300 m from the aircraft, and Lindsay says that \"the object gave no depth perception, its size and height were hard to estimate\" as he only saw it for some 30-40 seconds. It was an oval or lenticular shape, appearing metallic and at an estimated 300 m seemed to be 9 m long, by 2.75-3 m wide and probably 1 m thick. It had well-defined edges and a dull or non-reflecting surface, similar to anodising (white-grey). Both viewers thought it peculiar that there was no shadow on it — the sun was setting behind them and should have reflected on the leading edge of the object but didn't. The object flew sideways just like an airplane wing. The incident was not officially reported but came to the notice of UFOR(FNQ) who interviewed the (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"(Australasia, Continued) SCALE : J BRISBANE Location of Australasian UFO/Aircraft Incidents, 1977-79 observers. Port Augusta Our third case presents us with somewhat of a mystery. A light aircraft pilot who was flying from Mount Gambler to Adelaide overhead a radio conversation concerning a UFO. It was the evening of May 3, 1978 (although the exact time is not known) when his radio came to life and he heard an aircraft near Port Augusta calling the Adelaide airport, to report a visual sighting of a bright light, which had it seems also been picked up on the plane's radar. The entire story wasn't known as our informant was landing at the time. Investigations were initiated by UFOR(SA) and a check made of the two airlines flying in the area plus the local St. John Air Ambulance Service based near Port Augusta; also the Department of Transport and the Royal Australian Air Force were contacted. There were two planes in the area at the time, neither of which reportedly had observed any unusual phenomena. A search of the airport flight service records revealed a police report of two red flares being sighted 8 n.m. south of Whyalla at 8:58 p.m. but nothing else. An advertisement placed in several local papers failed to solicit any response for visual observations. The RAAF declined to answer our query for any details they might have. Overall we were left with not being able to do much more than record a possible event. Whyalla This case came to the ears of UFOR(FNQ) who forwarded it it UFOR(SA) for investigations, which have not yet been finalized. A man was piloting a light aircraft from Adelaide to Whyalla, South Australia, on Dec. 30, 1978, at about 11 p.m. flying at 2,800 m, speed 220 knots. Over Alford he noticed what to him appeared to be another aircraft flying parallel at an estimated 24 km distance. He checked with Adelaide but was advised that there was no traffic in the area. Looking back to the object he realized that there were no navigation lights on it, it was merely an elongated white light with a blue tinge around the edge. It stayed with him until he turned left in the Whyalla circuit area, and it stopped moving until the plane came on to the downwind leg of the circuit. At this stage it closed in on the plane very quickly, so the pilot landed as fast as he could. The object turned away and disappeared. , ' . . Policy The Goondiwindi, Kunanurra, Port Augusta, and Whyalla incidents have all come to our knowledge privately. None has appeared in the media and only Whyalla can be substantiated from official records. The Department of Transport is the government department responsible for oversight of all aspects of civilian air movements and safety. Its policy is clear. Enquirers are usually referred to the RAAF 7 : The RAAF's policy is that there is no such thing as a genuine UFO 8 ; thus getting official confirmation of a UFO/aircraft incident remains difficult. Two main airlines operate within Australia and their attitude seems to be that individual pilots are free to tajk about such observations they make, unlike the RAAF. Private pilots are under no apparent restrictions, but it would seem that they, make no official report because of the attitude of the Deparment of Transport and RAAF. In summary, some interesting air encounters have occurred over the past two years but a complete investigation is extremely difficult due to official policies. 9 - 10 NOTES 1.

Niemtzow, M.D. and      -•. • John F. Schuessler (Project VISIT, Fricndswood, Texas) Many of the witnesses of close encounters associated with the UFO phenomenon report substantial medical injuries. These injuries may be classified into three categories. The first category is of a temporary nature, dealing with paralysis, 1 dizziness, nausea, vomiting, headache, blindness, perception of odors, and high frequency audio sounds. The second category deals with the more chronic effects usually associated with skin lesions, which may represent direct pathology through unknown mechanisms. These skin lesions, which previously were described as burns 2 produced by ionizing radiation, do not compare clinically, as we know it, to ultraviolet radiation or megavoltage photon or electron skin reactions as described in classical radiotherapy. The third category may involve parapsychological manifestations which may interrupt normal emotional behavior. 3 The untoward effects of UFO , close encounters clearly demonstrates the possible existence of the phenomenon. Because the reports of the selectiveness of the pathological and psychological impact to humans remains' poorly studied and poorly understood an in-depth evaluation is suggested. The purpose of this paper is to recommend to physicians the acquisition of certain data that may be helpful in the clinical setting to evaluate and possibly assess the credibility of an actual close encounter. The following medical tests are suggested (pathophysiology is supplied where appropriate): 1. COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT WITH DIFFERENTIAL. Net increases in the number of white blood cells have been reported resulting from exposure to weightlessness during various manned space missions.\" A reduction in the lymphocyte population will result if exposure to ionizing radiation is encountered. Suppression is also seen under stress situations due to release of glucocorticoids 5 or weightlessness. One can expect an increase in neutrophils and a decrease in monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils in weightlessness. 2. SERUM CORTISOL. Diurnal fluctations are known to exist for serum cortisol, as well as in sodium • and potassium excretion. Cortisol tends to peak near the early morning hours. Rapid displacement from geographical location and time zones may disturb this rhythm. 3. WEIGHT LOSS. All' but one U.S. astronaut has lost weight in space. 4.SERUM AND URINARY POTASSIUM, SODIUM. AND CHLORIDE. Serum arid urinary potassium, sodium, and chloride . retention have occurred in postflight observations .of astronauts, with weightlessness producing an important potassium loss and consequential. abnormal cardiac rhythms. 5. URINE CALCIUM AND PHOSPHORUS. Urine'calcium and phosphorus may be increased. 6. URINARY KETONES. Starvation should cause the formation of urinary ketone bodies. 6 7. SERUM GLUCOSE. This, is a baseline test. 8. CHEST X-RAY. A standard chest x-ray should be taken. 9. BIOPSIES OF SKIN LESIONS. The aforementioned tests are suggested as a baseline for an in-depth study of medical injuries resulting from UFO close, encounters. These simple tests, if administered by qualified physicians, can be in the best interest of the witness (i.e., patient), as well as providing valuable data on the reported Project VISIT symposium hosts: I to r Richard Niemtzow, Alan Holt, John Schuessler, Granvil Pennington, Donald Tucker, Dave Kissinger . incident. Because of the lack of data to date, a number of assumptions must be considered — test to determine if the witness was subjected to prolonged weightlessness, • moved from one geographical location to another, prevented from receiving nourishment, etc. The results of this study should be quite valuable in assessing the credibility of future close encounter reports.

Lighthouses The second significant series of sightings began soon after the aircraft turned towards Christchurch at 0027. At about 0030 the Wellington radar operator advised the aircrew of a target in their 3 o'clock position at about 4 miles range. Soon after this the co-pilot spotted a flashing light that was apparently travelling along just above the wingtip at the right of the aircraft. At about 0032 a passenger recorded, \"It's been following us for quite a while. It's about 4 miles away and it looks like a very faint star but then it emits a very bright white and green light.\" The co-pilot described it as looking like a white light on a small 'plane, but it had a \"greenish fleck or tinge\", the pilot turned off the navigation light, but the other light remained. Just after 0032 the crew advised Wellington, \"Got a target at 3 o'clock just behind us\", and then just after 0035, \"We think we saw that one. It came up at 4 o'clock, I think, about 4 miles away. During this rime, from about 0027 to 0036, the Wellington radar operator had been advising the aircrew of several different targets at various bearings, and at ranges between 1 and 15 miles. The pilot turned the aircraft in a 360° left orbit at about 0036, but no lights were seen corresponding to the radar, echoes. During this orbit the crew pointed out the lights of a \"squid fleet\" to the passengers. It was about 220 km south-east of the aircraft, and from our previous calculation for Christchurch lights it would, in a normal atmosphere in the absence of clouds, have been clearly visible. Thus, only one light was seen; this light \"followed\" the aircraft, \"just off the right wing\" for about 7 minutes, at a bearing described as 3 or 4 o'clock. It was very faint, except when it flashed very brightly with a greenish white light. We note that at 0030 Kaikoura was 22 miles away at \"3 o'clock\" and at 0036 it was 30 miles away at \"twenty-past 4\", yet there is no record of the lights of the town being seen at the same time as the flashing light. The sighting line from the aircraft to Kaikoura at 0033 would be at a depression of about 6°. The windows in the aircraft are forward of, and higher than, the wings, and the view of the wingtip from the cabin may be depressed more than 6° during flight. (The nose of the aircraft is tilted upwards when climbing, and even during level flight, but neyer more than some 15° above horizontal.) So a light which was \"just off the wingtip\" may have come from a source in or near to Kaikoura. Most of the lights of the town, however, would have been hidden behind the hills of the Kaikoura Peninsula, and any which were seen would more than likely have been faint. The Point Keen lighthouse at the easternmost tip of the Kaikoura Peninsula, when seen from the position of the aircraft at 0030-0036, is a very bright flashing white light, with a brightness of 11,000 candelas and a nominal range at sea level of 14 miles. It is on for 2 seconds, off for 1 second, on for 2 seconds, and then off for 10 seconds before repeating the cycle. The lights of Kaikoura were last noted by a passenger during the turn at Kaikoura East at 0027, only 3 minutes earlier. If this series of sightings is to be ascribed to a UFO then the absence of the light from Point Keen and Kaikoura for over 6 minutes must be agreed to by the witnesses. Comment R: Ireland has referred to the series of radar and visual sightings following the turn at Kaikoura East. He has left out the radar target which was detected behind the plane about 30 seconds to one minute after the turn. This target apparently remained stationary for a minute or more as the plane flew along. At a bout 0030 Wellington referred to a \"further\" target at 3:00 (the righthand side of the plane) at 4 (nautical) miles. Ireland referred to the event at 0030, but then ignored the following radar event at about 0030:30 when Wellington called the plane and said \"there's a strong target right in formation with you now, could be left or right. Your target has doubled in size.\" After hearing this message the copilot began to look out the right window. At an undetermined time he observed a little, steady white light, \"like passing a light aircraft at night.\" This light had a greenish fleck or tinge (The reporter gave the description cited above by Ireland.) About 30 seconds later Wellington reported that the plane target had \"reduced to normal size,\" implying that the other target was no longer flying in formation with the plane. About 0032:30 the plane reported the visual sighting of a target \"at 3:00, just behind us.\" Wellington responded (Continued on next page) 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"(New Zealand, Continued)/   ' \"Yes, and going around at 4:00.\" The visual target appeared to drop back or just go out of view, which is consistent with the Wellington radar reports of a target which was at the right side of the plane and dropping back as the plane flew along. The target apparently remained stationary for several more minutes, because at about 0035:30 Wellington reported \"that target is still stationary. It's now 6:00 to you at about 15 (nautical) miles and its been joined by two other targets.\" Within a minute after this statement the three targets behind the plane \"merged\" to make a single blip on the radar scope which was bigger than the blip made by the Argosy aircraft. The captain thought that a target that big might be large enough to see and initiated a 360° orbit, referred to by Ireland, but nothing was seen. In retrospect, one notes that the extra large blip could have been made by relatively small targets that were spaced closely enough so that the radar could not resolve the distance between them — a spacing of about 1 -2 nautical miles at the distance in question. The light off the right wing was seen for an estimated 2-4 minutes. It was seen above and slightly foward of the navigation light (green) on the end of the wing until it dropped back or \"disappeared\" (was no longer seen). According to % xthe copilot the wing hid the Kaikoura town lights. Ireland claims that most of the town lights would have been hidden by the mountains on the Kaikoura Peninsula anyway. He therefore proposes that the Point Kean lighthouse, on the end of the peninsula, was the source of the light. One notes from his description that this light flashes white only twice every 15 seconds. In support of his argument he states that the sighting line over the wing would probably be depressed by about 6° since \"the windows of the aircraft are forward of and above the wings.\" However, Ireland has apparently not consulted dimensioned drawings of the aircraft which show that the centerlineof the wing is only a couple of feet below the centerline of the windows. Moreover, there is an upward bend of the wing from the inner engine outward which could make the wingtip as high as the cockpit windows. An experiment done by the captain with the plane on the ground suggests a depression angle of no more than 2°. However, in the air, under heavy loading, the wing would bend upward, leading one to conclude that a sighting line over the wing might be horizontal or even higher than horizontal, but not 6° downward. Ireland states that, \"If this series of sightings is to be ascribed to a UFO then the absence of the light from Point Kean and Kaikoura for over 6 minutes must be agreed to be the witnesses.\" The copilot had already stated that he could not see the Kaikoura town lights during the sighting. To test the hypothesis that the Point Kean light was seen, the pilot and copilot carefully observed Point Kean during a similar flight after the Ireland report came out. They attest that despite careful observation for many minutes, only about two flashes were seen that could be attributed to the Point Kean light. These observations were made during the trips north and south along the same flight path as the December 30/31 flight. The copilot has explicitly stated that the Point Kean light was not what he saw on the 31st of Dec., 1978. An interesting sequence of sightings began at about 0251 on the northbound trip when two very bright flashing lights appeared directly in front of the aircraft, apparently quite a long way ahead. As with the earlier sightings, those in the aircraft tried to identify these lights with radar echoes being reported by the Wellington Controller, but without success. A passenger likened the display to that seen over the Kaikoura coast on the southbound flight, but then the lights had not flashed so much as they were now doing. COMMENT S: Referring to sightings starting about 0251, Ireland states that the passengers tried to identify the lights with Wellington radar targets, but \"without success.\" However, the transcript reads as follows: (Plane) \"Wellington, do you have (a target) in my 12:00 position probably somewhere near Grassmere or perhaps a little east of Grassmere?\" (Wellington) Affirmative. I have a strong target at 12:00 to you at 20 (nautical) miles and, uh, that's 2 miles off the coast, 10 miles south of Cape Campbell.\" (Plane) Roger. We have that one also, and quite a good visual display at the moment.\" The photographer obtained a film record which showed a light or lights which fluctuated rapidly from bright white to dim red and orange, at a surprisingly constant rate. A complete cycle took 8.85 + 0.15 frames at a nominal shutter speed of 10 frames/second. It is believed that this film sequence shows the same light or lights as seen by the others in the aircraft at that time. A passenger described an extremely bright flashing light with another one just to the left, also flashing (apparently independently). He had the impression of a light which was rolling and turning in a narrow ellipse with the major axis vertical. At one point it appeared to drop at an incredible speed. The direction of this sighting was quite clearly defined by the pilot as \"in the 12 o'clock position probably somewhere near Grassmere, or perhaps a little east of Grassmere\". Cape Campbell is just east of Grassmere. The Cape Campbell lighthouse, towards which the aircraft was heading, is a 1.5 million candela white light which flashes once every 30 seconds. At 0251 the aircraft was about 60 km south of Cape Campbell. Just 4° to the right of Cape Campbell, at a range of about 135 km, was The Brothers lighthouse which flashes once every 10 seconds with a 1 million candela white light. Then, about 25° to the right of Cape Campbell, there were the Baring Head and Pencarrow Head lighthouses, each showing bright white lights in the direction of the aircraft. Baring Head is on for 9 seconds and eclipsed for 6 seconds, with an intensity of 64000 candelas. Pencarrow Head, intensity 6100 candelas, is on for 1 second, off for 1.5 seconds, on for 1 second, off for 1.5 seconds, on for 2 seconds, and then off for 5 seconds before repeating the cycle. 8"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"(New Zealand, Continued) The leading lights at the main entrance to Wellington harbour would have been about 21° east of Cape Campbell. The front light is of interest because it is a \"quick flashing\" white light with an intensity of more than 2400 candelas in the direction of the aircraft. It flashes once per second with approximately l / 2 second on, l / 2 second off. If the movie camera shutter speed was not as reported 10 frames/second, but due to improper adjustment 11.2 frames/second, this light could have been the one photographed. At the time of writing the shutter speed has not been checked. All of the navigation lights mentioned, plus several others, could conceivably have been seen from the aircraft at about 0251 in the absence of clouds. In fact they could have become visible much sooner, along with the lights of Wellington city, when the aircraft reached the reporting point MOTO at 0229. We know that there were scattered clouds below the aircraft at least some of the time, so we cannot be sure that the lights of Wellington were seen. However, it seems extraordinary that on such a beautifully clear starry night, at least the passengers would not have been impressed by the lights of Wellington and remarked upon their sighting. But no mention can be found anywhere of anyone having seen the lights and lighthouses of Wellington. Last, but not least, the planet Jupiter was only 8° east of the aircraft heading, and 27° above the horizon at 0251, yet it too does not appear to have been noteworthy, and it would have been well above any cloud layer, and the brightest celestial body at the time. Vellingco Sector of illumination by 7000 cd quick flashing white source. COMMENT T: Ireland points out that the people on the plane were looking into an area that is populated with flashing lights. The implication is that possibly the crew, but certainly the passengers were confused and thought the flashing lights were \"UFOs.\" However, the air crew had flown this route many times and were not susceptible to such confusion. Ireland has further commented that \"it seems extraordinary\" that on a clear night the passengers and /or crew would not have commented on the stars, Jupiter, Wellington lights (which, according to the captain are not particularly impressive at that distance) and lighthouses. Of course the passengers and crew did talk about such things. In particular, the crew was continually telling the passengers what not to pay attention to or photograph. In this regard, the crew was acting as an instantaneous filter center against non-\"UFOs.\" Ireland tentatively identifies the photographed flashing light as a front light in the entrance to Wellington harbor. The light, according to Ireland, is rated at 2400 cd. Actually the light to which he refers has a section radiating white light to the north with an intensity of 2400 cd., and a section radiating light to the south.with an intensity of 7000 cd. It is the radiation to the south which is of interest. One notes from Figure 2 that, assuming the light radiates according to the published specifications, the illuminated area never intercepts the path of the plane. However, perhaps the light actually radiates farther west than it is supposed to do. Then, to determine whether or not the light suggested by Ireland or any light around Wellington could have made the photographic images, it is necessary to make another brightness comparison. When the photographed light is white, it saturates the film. A useful lower bound estimate on the film exposure is five times the exposure necessary to provide \"good\" exposure. The distance from the plane to the harbor light was about 122 km. A calculation shows that the light would have had to radiate an intensity of about 1.2 x 10 9 candelas, or about 175,000 times the actual radiated intensity to produce the white images. Even if photographed from the closest approach of the plane to Wellington, after the plane passed Cape Campbell but before turning for the final approach into Blenheim, the light would have had to radiate about nine million candelas. One notes that even the Cape Campbell beacon, which is the most powerful beacon in the area, radiates only about 1.5 million candelas. Of course, marine lights such as the Cape Campbell beacon radiate outwards in a horizontal manner, and so from aircraft altitudes the lights may appear weaker than they actually are. (As a matter of interest, one might note that at 0251 the Cape Campbell beacon was about 60 km from the plane, so even it should not have produced highly saturated images had it been photographed.) 3. Squid Fishing Boats The period of the sightings (on and after 20 December 1978) coincided with the arrival in New Zealand waters of a large squid fishing fleet. The positions of the squid boats at specified times are reported to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries by the owners. Those boats fishing on any particular night also report their position, although the precise times during which their lights are \"on\" is not recorded. 45 The lights on these boats are strung around the gunwales some 2 metres above deck level, with or without shades. Each boat has about 50 bulbs, each 3 or 4 kilowatts, and the light produced has an intensity of about 300,000- 400,000 candelas. The main fleet of some 30 boats was fishing on the Memoo Bank, 44°S, 176°E, on the morning of 31 December. Another 20 boats at least were in transit between fishing grounds that night, and several others were fishingoff Karamea, Farewell Spit, and in Tasman Bay. The light from some of these boats was recorded on a photograph taken by a Defense Meteorology satellite at (Continued on next page) 9 Figure 2"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"(New Zealand, Continued) 0030 NZDT on 31 December. 23 Obviously the photograph would not have revealed the positions of those ships which were not fishing with their lights on at the time, but which may have \"lit up\" later in the morning. The main^fleet was seen by those on the aircraft at a distance of 220 km. COMMENT U: According to Ireland squid boats report their locations at specified times and \"those boats fishing on any particular night also report their position\" (sic). According to a Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries representative (private communication to the aircraft captain), properly licensed boats could fish in the Pegasus Bay, the body of water northeast of Christchurch, legally as along as they stayed outside the twelve mile limit. The \"UFO hunt\" of 31 December took a dramatic turn at 0219 on the northbound flight, when a very bright light became visible through the tops of a cloud layer. It did not appear to be appreciably above the height of the aircraft, which was at a height of 0.8 km. The light appeared between 10° and 30° to the right of the aircraft. It was seen by four of the witnesses to be accompanied by a weaker light below; two interpreted the lower light as a reflection in the ocean. About 3 minutes later, when the aircraft had climbed to about 1.6 km, one of the film crew recorded that the brighter light was still above the other, and that it had moved a little further ahead of the other. It then appeared to go behind a cloud and to light up the clouds around it; it disappeared, and then returned, apparently as only one light. By the time the cameraman commenced filming, only one light remained (only one light shows on the film). The aircraft radar was now operating and showed an echo at about 35 km range which was 3 to 5 times stronger than the crew would have expected from a large fishing boat. The half power points of the vertical radar beam are about 3° and 15° below the centreline of the aircraft. At the time of this sighting the aircraft was climbing at 3° and was about 1.6 km above the sea. This suggests that the radar target was below the horizontal, and so below the level of the aircraft. The disappearance of the light behind the clouds at this time suggests that the light was below the cloud tops (about 0.8 km). We also note that an object on the surface of the sea would be only about 1° below horizontal when first seen at an estimated distance of .50 km, and when first observed on the radar at 35 km about 2° below horizontal. The sighting line to the light agreed with the radar target azimuth for the next 3 minutes, as the radar range decreased to 16-20 km and the aircraft climbed to 3 km. The inference is that the light and radar echo came from the same object — a UFO. The radar echo disappeared off the right of the screen because the UFO was too close to be within the radar beam. At this time the bright light was about 50° to the right and 15° below the aircraft. After a further 3 minutes a right turn was made, and the light was filmed at the right of the aircraft, at a distance of the order of 10 km. The aircraft was at a height of 4 km and the light was estimated to be about 30° below. The aircraft then turned left and continued on its flight, the light being last seen below and behind. During the turn the pilot thought it appeared to the left above the aircraft. These observations suggest that the UFO was in fact on the surface of the sea, and we look to the surveillance radar observations to support this view. COMMENT V: Ireland's history of the sighting of a bright light as the plane came out of Christchurch is based on the information supplied in ref. 23. This information, although satisfactory for purposes of initial analysis,'is not complete. Some details were left out and one detail in particular was wrong. Moreover, Ireland has \"distorted\" another detail which was correctly reported in ref. 23. Therefore some corrections and additions to Ireland's recitation of the events is necessary (refer to Figure 3).   ,.. . . ^ ^. . . a '    The plane left the ground at Christchurch at about 0217 and flew up into the cloud cover, reaching the lower level of clouds in about a minute. The direction of flight was within 45° degrees of the bright light source that was observed as the plane broke through the clouds, but no such light was seen, even though such a light, if on the surface, should have been visible as soon as the aircraft reached about 500 ft in altitude. This assumes the light was about 25 nautical miles (46 km) from the aircraft, a location determined by the first radar contact. Thus, if the light was a squid boat, it must have turned it's lights on during the time the plane was in the cloud, i.e., around 0218-0219. The light was first seen as the plane broke through the clouds at a level apparently below the aircraft. The captain thought it was not far above Christchurch Airport o Kaikoura East ^ \\coranent Y Figure 3 This diagram illustrates the flight path of the plane, the radar detections, and the reported sighting directions. Ireland incorrectly indicated a 120° turn to the right. 10 7 r*"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"(New Zealand, Continued) the sea. The reporter noted the reflection of the light in the sea in his first taped messages, but then ignored it in subsequent messages as his attention was drawn to the much more intense light source. The film initially shows a roughly elliptical source with its major axis tilted 45° with the left end higher than the right end. The shape does not appear to be a result of aircraft window distortion, since image shapes of known \"point\" soucres (e.g., aiport landing lights), when not smeared by camera motion, are round. The tilt of the axis is not a result of camera motion. No other light appears to be in the film, suggesting that the reflection was very weak. When the light was first seen the captain turned the radar from standby to on in the mapping mode. He used the mapping mode (rather than weather mode) because he was not looking at a weather phenomenon and also because the object appeared to be slightly below the aircraft. He detected the object on an inner ring of the 50 (nautical) mile scale, and so switched to the 20 mile scale for better resolution. He had a very large return just inside the 20 mile range ring (about 19 n.m. or 35 km). This detection — sighting direction A on Figure 3 — which occurred within 30 seconds or so of first seeing the light, happened about three minutes earlier than reported in ref. 23. Therefore on Ireland's map the first radar detection should be moved back to the location of the first visual sighting. The radar azimuth, according to the captain's memory of the screen, stayed at about a constant value in the neighborhood of 30° to the right while the target moved inward to closer distances for several minutes. The target reached a distance of 8-12 n.m. (15-22 km) and moved around to the right on the scope, going off the scope at the limit of the sweep, 60° (given incorrectly as 50° in ref. 23) — direction B on Figure 3. After the radar target disappeared off the scope the light appeared to travel along with the plane. Unfortunately the exact duration of the radar target is unknown, but estimated to have been 3-5 minutes. Location B corresponds to about a 5 minute duration on the scope. At 0227 — C on Figure 3 — the plane reported its position to Wellington Air Traffic Control as being 32 n.m. (59 km) out of Christchurch and 11,500 ft in altitude. The plane also reported a \"great big target\"at 3:00 (90° to the right and at an estimated distance of 12 n.m. About 3 minutes later the plane reached 13,000ft and the captain, who could not see the object from his seat at the left of the aircraft, decided to turn to the right. The plane turned 92° to the right, as determined from gyrocompass headings (33° magnetic to 125° magnetic; there is a 22° declination to the east). Ireland has incorrectly shown this as a 120° turn. After the turn to the right the object was apparently at a considerable depression angle below horizontal since it was not picked up on radar. Witnesses watching out the right side of the plane reported that during the turn the line of sight to the object moved toward the front of the aircraft — D on Figure 3. However, the captain does not remember actually seeing it appear ahead of him, suggesting that from his seat at the left of the cockpit the line of sight was still somewhat to the right and that the depression angle exceeded about 10°, which is the experimentally determined approximate cutoff angle caused by the nose of the aircraft. The other witnesses, looking out the right side (and two were standing up and able to see \"over\" the hose'of the aircraft) observed the object start to move to the right. The copilot had the impression that the plane moved closer to the object as it turned onto the 125 magnetic heading, but that almost immediately the object started to increase its distance from the plane. As the plane flew along the new heading the sighting line moved continually to the right as indicated by E and F on Figure 3. The cameraman may have photographed during the turn. It is estimated that shortly after the turn he got and installed a larger lens on his camera, an operation that would have taken about two minutes or more. He then proceeded to take the film segment showing large (defocused) images which were emphasized in news media releases. The plane flew along 125° magnetic for about 2 minutes and then turned left. The lighten the right side was apparently seen during the turn because its apparent motions were described by the reporter. It may also have remained at the right after the turn, since apparently the cameraman was still able to film it at locations F, G, and H. The turn back toward the initial heading to Kaikoura East from the southeast heading was done in two stages. The captain initiated the turn while watching the glow from the light out the right side. As he turned he noticed that the glow was not decreasing, as he had expected it would if they were leaving the light behind. It appeared that the glow, if anything, was actually getting brighter. He noticed this increased glow after he had turned about 30° to the left. Then, looking ahead of the plane he was surprised to see what he thought was the same light appear in front of him at a higher altitude — sighting direction I. He was apparently startled by this and stopped the turn allowing the plane to level on a magnetic heading of about 65°. This second light was still above horizontal, but it quickly moved to the left and downwards in a manner which caused the captain to think that he had actually passed over it on the left side — sighting direction J. No other passengers recall a light passing to the left of the airplane, apparently because they were all watching the first light which stayed on the right side (except the copilot, who was busy filling out flight forms). After the second light, described as appearing slightly smaller but just as intense as the light at the right, had passed to the left and below the plane the captain continued the left turn onto a heading which would take the plane to Kaikoura East. , There is no mention of this object being observed by either the Christchurch or Wellington radars. This is not surprising, for either of two reasons. The first is that it was apparently stationary. These radars are normally operated in the moving target mode, in which targets moving at less than some 15 knots are not seen. If the object was airborne, we would expect it to be moving — the witnesses on the aircraft thought it was moving — yet it was not seen on either the Christchurch or Wellington (Continued on next page) H"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"(New Zeland, Continued) surveillance radars, both of which were definitely receiving echoes from the aircraft at this time. Alternatively, consider that the object was below the radar horizon. The Christchurch radar has a minimum elevation for aircraft detection under normal conditions, of approximately 1°, so an object below 1.5 km at the point of \"encounter\" would not normally be detected, even if it were moving. The minimum height for a normal radar sighting from Wellington would be about 1.15 km. There was other evidence that the radar horizon was extended by super-refraction that morning, so a moving target would have to be even lower down than 1.15 km to escape detection. The lack of a radar sighting confirms the previous deduction that the object was below 1.6 km, and raises serious doubt about the UFO being airborne, and its apparent movement. Rather it supports the contention that the UFO could have been a stationary ship. The size and intensity of the light has been estimated from an analysis of the movie film 23 . The photographs which were taken at an estimated range of 18 km showed the light to be consistent with a non-circular, non-uniform source 12 m high and 18 m wide, with an intensity of 260,000 candelas. A source of such intensity would be visible at a distance in excess of 55 km in an atmosphere with 30 km visibility. It is also remarkably near to the estimated luminous intensity of a squid boat (300,000-400,000 candelas). COMMENT W: In the above photograph Ireland refers to the object seen at the right of the aircraft. He correctly points out two alternative explanations for the failure of the Christchurch and Wellington radars to detect the object: object was stationary and/or object was below the radar beams. His claim that the Wellington radar horizon was extended by super-refraction is disputed by the information provided by the Wellington radar technician (no more than the usual amount of coastline seen), so his lower bound of 1.15 km height may be in error. But is is clear that at least to be below the Christchurch radar beam the object would have to be below about 1.5 km. An alternative explanation for the failure of ground radar detection could be that the object had a small radar cross section for 50 cm radar while it had a large cross section for 3 cm weather radar on the plane. Ireland accepts the estimate of the intensity of the light as given in reference 23, and correctly points out that the value is comparable to the luminous intensity of a fishing boat, providing that all the 5000-watt bulbs which are strung around the deck were individually unresolved and instead viewed as one \"big\" bulb. The size of the object, as estimated from the film — 18 m or about 60ft. wide — is, however, small for a squid boat. According to information published by the New Zealand government, squid boats range up to 60 m and have loading capacities up to 300 tons. During the left turn the pilot was surprised to see a light (which he thought was the light from the UFO) appear at the front left above the aircraft. This light must be satisfactorily explained. To consider that it came from the UFO would be inconsistent with all the other information available, which clearly suggests some largish craft significantly below the aircraft and, at the time, to the right rear. It is not inconsistent, however, with an observation made during this encounter by the co-pilot. The co-pilot is reported 46 as seeing Venus out far to the left and the UFO to starboard. He is also reported as saying they were different colours, sizes and shapes, and that the two were definitely there at the same time. This was a remarkable statement, considering that Venus had still not risen; even at 13,000 ft Venus would not have risen until about 0304. So what celestial body did the co-pilot see and mistake for Venus? The obvious choice would be Jupiter, which at 0229 would have been at 26.2° elevation 16.5* east. The aircraft heading prior to the right rum was 55° east, and after the right turn 147° east, so Jupiter would be seen out to the left. When the pilot turned left to regain the route to Kaikoura East he approached the track at an intercept of about 30°. During this manouvre the aircraft heading would be about 25° east, surprisingly near to the sighting line to Jupiter at 16.5° east; Jupiter would appear at the front left above the aircraft and could explain this sighting. COMMENT X: Ireland identifies the light seen ahead and then to the left as the planet Jupiter. He has apparently discounted the claim by the captain, as reported in reference 23 and in Comment V, that the light was seen to drop downwards and possibly pass beneath the plane. In the opinion of this investigator Jupiter could not explain this sighting. Ireland claims that the copilot said he saw Venus at the same time as the bright object. The copilot's \"report\" is a newspaper report correctly paraphrased by Ireland/In a separate detailed interview the copilot stated that he first saw Venus about 25-30 minutes later when the plane was near Cape Campbell, around 0255-0300 at about the expected time for Venus to rise. At that time also he was watching two unidentified lights \"behind Blenheim.\" Since the plane did an orbit near Cape Campbell there would have been a period of time when the plane was heading southwards. For that short time the unidentified lights would have been to the right and Venus to the left of the aircraft. The copilot does not remember seeing Jupiter. The squid boat records did not reveal that a boat was fishing near the position of this UFO sighting on the morning of 31 December. However, this does not mean that no such boat could have been there, considering that if it had been fishing it could well have been doing so illegally. In such circumstances, it does not appear surprising that there is no record of any known boat fishing there at that time. The evidence points strongly to a brightly-lit squid fishing boat as the UFO involved in this encounter. This conclusion is reached without invoking any unusual atmospheric conditions. (continued on next page; 12"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"(New Zealand, Continued) COMMENT Y: Ireland's discovery that no fishing boat was reported near the position of the UFO sighting is significant. He suggests that there actually was a boat there (the unknown/illegal fishing boat) that did not report because it was fishing illegally. As pointed out in Comment U the location would not have been illegal, so the fishing would have been legal unless the boat did not report. • With no independent evidence that a squid boat was in fact in the area of the UFO sighting the investigator must show that the details of the sighting are consistent with the squid boat hypothesis. Ireland has tried to do this by arguing that the available evidence shows that the light was (a) below about 1.5 km (and therefore could be on the surface) and (b) stationary. These two conditions, coupled with the brightness calculation of ref. 23, suggest that the light source could have been a stationary squid boat on the ocean suface. However, in order to show that the object was stationary Ireland had to distort the path of the plane and ignore certain other details of the sighting. The more complete analysis presented in Comment V suggests that the object moved over considerable distances during the sighting, a capability not characteristic of a squid boat. The minimum distance moved can be estimated from the position of the last sighting and from the initial radar detection. The reporter thought that he was the last person to see the light on the right. He pressed his head against the window and looked downward. The maximum depression angle from a side window is about 45° (limited by the structure of the aircraft below the cockpit). At a height of 13,000 ft a depression angle of 45° intersects the surface at a point about 3 n.m. (5.6 km) from a point just below the plane. Thus, if on the surface, the object moved at the very least from the location of its first radar detection, about 45 km from Christchurch, to a point in the close vicinity of the plane when the plane turned left, about 80 km from Christchurch. If the radar detections are \"thrown out\" as anomalous and only the visual sighting directions are accepted, the \"boat\" could be at X in the map (Figure 3). This satisfies the sighting direction requirements from points A, B.....G, but even at the point of closest approach during the left turn of the plane it would be about 25 km away at a depression angle of about 10°, hardly low enough to require the reporter to press his head against the window and look down. Incidentally, a reflective target such as a squid boat at location X would be detected by the aircraft radar continually as the plane flew along the southeast heading.) There was one further sighting on the northbound trip which seems to have been well enough reported for known sources to be suggested. Again, squid boats are thought to be responsible, but at a considerable distance from the aircraft. At about 0255 the pilot reported a bright light behind Woodbourne — to a passenger it was above Blenheim — definitely not in the same place as the earlier sighting at 0251, and it was extremely bright. Another passenger appears to have been watching a small light over Blenheim for about four or five minutes when it was joined at the same height by a similar light. The photographer was preparing to film two bright lights but lost sight of them when the pilot orbited the aircraft to lose height at about 0255. Although Woodbourne aerodrome was obscured by the mountains about 0251 it would have become visible some time before 0255 looking down the Taylor River valley. A possible source for this light, if it was not the Woodbourne beacon, was either of two squid boats known to have been fishing in Tasman Bay that night. The lights from these boats, about 155 km from the aircraft at 0255 could have been seen through a normal atmosphere. COMMENT Z: The sighting of two bright orange lights in the direction of Woodbourne, and apparently moving northward toward Picton, is not as well documented as the previously considered sightings. However, whether or not the people on the plane could have seen the squid boats referred to by Ireland through the 1 /8 cloud cover over Blenheim is debatable. In any case, one notes that the inverse square law and atmospheric extinction effects assuming a 60 km visibility would reduce the apparent intensity of the squid boat lights (155 km away) by a factor of about 500,000 below the apparent intensity of the light seen near Christchurch at a distance of 18 km. At about 0256 the pilot saw upwards of twenty fairly dim lights to starboard. He though they were on the surface and that they came from a large number of small boats. We are reminded that upwards of twenty squid boats were on the move that night, many of them en route from the fishing grounds north of Nelson to the Mernoo Bank east of Christchurch. About this time the co-pilot pointed out Venus rising to the passengers. (Venus would rise at about 0300.) This is remarkable, since he had previously (at 0229) seen \"Venus\" to the north! There is no record of any further interesting or unusual lights being seen during the remainder of the flight, which ended at 0315 when the aircraft landed at Woodbourne. COMMENT AA: The reader is referred to Comment X. CONCLUSION Of the twenty-seven or so sufficiently well documented sightings of nocturnal lights studied in this report, none has been found for which a simple explanation is not possible. The sources proposed were known to be present at the times of the observations, and must be discounted by the witnesses if the sightings are to remain unidentified. In the most widely publicised \"encounter\" nothing unnatural, apart from the impressions of the witnesses, seems to have (continued on next page) 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"(New Zealand, Continued) occurred. This UFO was almost certainly a brightly-lit squid fishing boat caught in the act. It is therefore considered that the acronym UFO should refer to UnFamiliar Observations, rather than to Unidentified Flying Objects. COMMENT AB: One wonders how certain is \"almost certainly.\" Is Ireland 100% sure that the object was a squid boat? 99% sure? 90%? Does it mean anything to say \"almost certainly\" in light of the evidence presented? In the .Christchurch Star on January 2, 1979, the superintendent of the Mt. John Observatory was quoted as saying that he was 99% sure that the film showed Venus. \"It's the only thing we can think of,\" is a quote from the paper. After seeing the (mostly defocussed?) images shown on TV Mabin decided that the film showed Jupiter under poor filming conditions (The Press, Christchurch, Jan. 3, 1979). Apparently there was quite a bit of room for \"unsureness\" in the 1% left over between 99% and 100%. What the reader should understand is that in a case like this which may involve some new phenomenon about which we know little or nothing, we cannot be sure of what the reported phenomenon is. The best we can do is be sure of what it isn't. If, after carefully reviewing all phenomena that are relevant to the sighting, we only have a lot of \"it isn'ts,\" then we may decide that a truly new phenomenon was involved. In view of the comments presented here on Ireland's work it appears that not all of the well-reported sightings have been explained. This still leaves room for UFOs to mean Unidentified Flying Objects. A list of unexplained sightings is presented in an appendix.     . REFERENCES (Ireland) 1. Evening Post, 1978, December 22.   24.

Ten speakers from North Carolina, South Carolina, and Maryland will speak on various facets of the UFO problem; they represent scientific, technical, law enforcement, and other specialized fields. Exhibits, printed materials, a reception, and a picnic are also on the 2-day agenda. For further information call Mrs. Gayle C. McBride, conference chairperson; nights: 919-969-6476; days: 919-725-4268. STAR HERAID, Scott3 Bluff, NE March 8, 1980 Close encounter at SB? Lawmen track down UFO GERING — Tucked away in the yellow report sheets of the Gering Police Department is a simple report that says \"miscellaneous service report, assist other agency,\" but it probably should read, \"UFO, all other.\" Officers from Gering and deputies from the Scotts Bluff County Sheriff's Department had their eyes to the sky Friday night looking for an unidentified flying object. THE INITIAL sighting was made by a Gering woman living on Pacific Boulevard. At 8:20 p.m. she reported that a very bright light was seen hover- Ing over the Scotts Bluff National Mon- ument. The light, then broke Into two large white lights then joined back into one light, she said. HOPING FOR their own close en- counter, a Gering officer and deputy sheriff headed to the monument and contacted a park ranger who said he had observed a low-flying aircraft near the monument at about 7:30 p.m. A call was placed to the Flight Ser- vice at the county airport and it was discovered that a small plane had left a short time earlier on a flight to Torring- ton, Wyo.. but the direction of night should not have been toward the mon- ument. ANOTHER POSSIBILITY, that of a student pilot getting in some night flying and \"having some fun,\" was also considered. According to United Press Interna- tional, the \"evening stars\" this limp of year .ire Voniis. Mars anil Jupiter. The comliination of one of those plan els and a low flying air craft with its landing lights on may be the answer, but the Gering woman is probably still wan4trui|. UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE The UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE will keep you informed of all the latest United States and World-Wide UFO activity, as it happens! Our service was started in 1969, at which time we contracted with a reputable international newspaper-clipping bureau to obtain for us, those hard to find UFO reports (i.e., little known photographic cases, close encounter and landing reports, occupant cases) and all other UFO reports, many of which are carried only in small town or foreign newspapers. \"Our UFO Newsclipping Service issues are 20-page monthly reports, reproduced by photo-offset, containing the latest United States and Canadian UFO newsclippings, with our foreign section carrying the latest British, Australian, New Zealand and other foreign press reports. Also included is a 3-5 page section of \"Fortean\" clippings (i.e. Bigfoot and other \"monster\" reports). Let us keep you informed of the latest happenings in the UFO and Fortean fields.\" For subscription information and sample pages from our service, write today to: UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE Route 1 — Box 220 Plumerville, Arkansas 72127 (N.Z.

The material originally appeared in PROBE Magazine' but is presented here in a more easily comprehended form accompanied by appropriate graphics, which best illustrate the potentially valuable information contained therein.) Science cannot yet explain the inherent nature of UFOs. Assuming that they are manned, or produced, by intelligent alien souces, we still have no clues to their purposes or to the technology behind their power of flight. These two aspects of the UFO problem seem to concern us most; first, we want to know why they are here and second, we want to know how they perform. We cannot haul the phenomenon into our laboratories so that it can be studied at leisure. We must be content, therefore, to observe it in its natural state, so to speak — during its sporadic and short-lived appearances. Faced with the dilemma, we must look iorobjective correlations or internal constants in the appearance and behavior of UFOs. It is only in this way that we will be able to obtain any scientifically valid information. For the past 22 years this writer has studied reports of UFOs in the Southern California area. My main purpose has been to obtain the needed objective correlations or internal constants for an understanding of our local UFOs at least. Luckily, in southern California and particularly in the Los Angeles Basin there is a plentiful and constant supply of UFO reports from credible witnesses. In this area, as in other places around the world, distinct UFO shapes can be recognized from repetitive sightings, 16 ,    .

In fact, many different types of correlations are evident in Los Angeles Basin UFO reports. It is impossible to discuss in limited space all the correlative material which several Southland researchers have found pver the years. This column will, therefore, be confined to the following hypothesis, derived from study of UFO data from this area — fhaf the flight paths and maneuvers of UFOs seem related to' the magnetic anomalies of the earth's terrain over which they appear. The term \"magnetic anomaly\" as used here refers to small closed contours, depicted on aeromagnetic maps, where the intensity of the earth's magnetic field is noted as differing from surrounding terrain. These differences (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"(California Report, Continued) are minor, but definite, and may be either higher or lower relative to the normal magnetic field measured in counts of gamma radiation. In this study the term \"magnetic anomaly\" does not apply to extensive contours which, by reason of their large size, are not shown as \"closed\" on aeromagnetic maps. Figure A is an aeromagnetic map of portions of the Los Angeles Basin. If the reproduction process permits, the \"closed\" magnetic anomalies at issue here may be readily seen. How was the above hypothesis developed? It began with a lengthy study of Southern California flap areas — localized communitites where UFO reports from reliable observers are numerous and repetitive. Two of the localities which this writer has studied in depth are a fairly new section of Yorba Linda in Orange County, about 25 air miles southeast from the Los Angeles Civic Center, and Temple City, a small town about 12 air miles east-northeast of the center of the Los Angeles metropolis. At first glance, there is not much similarity between the two towns. Yorba Linda, backed up to the rugged Santa Ana Mountains, is still a rapidly growing section of Orange County, while Temple City lies right in the midst of the heavily settled Los Angeles complex and is barely distinguishable from the other towns surrounding it. In the early 1970s, at a time when this writer and Mr. Richard Zimmerman, who was then also a MUFON investigator, were conducting joint UFO research, Rich suggested that documented UFO sightings be plotted on aeromagnetic maps to see if any correlation could be made with the magnetic features of our local terrain. While Rick concentrated on a map of the western portion of Los Angeles, I used a map which was published in 1964 by the U.S. Geological Survey in Washington, D.C. Its official number was GP465, and it included eastern Los Angeles and vicinity. 2 Figure A shows part of this map. The map information was compiled in 1959 from an aerial survey flown at 500 feet above the ground level. The scale was 1:48,000. This writer plotted 24 local, well- documented UFO cases at random on this aeromagnetic map, and a surprising feature was revealed. All cases in flap areas occurred well outside enclosed magnetic anomalies. In addition, sporadic cases occurring outside flap areas seemed to avoid, or, in flight, to skirt the edges of, small enclosed magnetic contours. It needs to be emphasized here that all cases plotted on the map could be classified as at least CE-I. That is, the UFO was close enough to the witness(es) so that a reasonably accurate judgment of the true position of the UFO in relationship to the ground terrain could be made. Yorba Linda and Temple City, two of Southern California's flap areas, were within the map's confines. Temple City lies totally within an area where no small closed magnetic contours exist. The perimeter of the survey passes through the eastern edge of Yorba Linda (Refer to Figure A), but the majority of cases studied in that community lie within the surveyed terrain. Here the same situation exists; there are no enclosed magnetic anomalies in the newly-constructed areas of Yorba Linda where the flap occurred. The older part of Yorba Linda, northwest of the flap area, was not concerned in the study; for no UFO reports came from that area of town. In summary, then, in two flap areas of Southern California there are no small, closed magnetic anomalies indicated on aeromagnetic maps. This fact seems more than coincidental, especially when we consider the fact that sporadic CE-I UFO cases also seem to avoid or skirt small closed magnetic anomalies elsewhere in the Los Angeles area. In Part II of this article, we will continue with an in-depth description of some of the cases in Yorba Linda and Temple City. Further verification and interpretation of our hypothesis will also be attempted. NOTES 1.

We appreciate this method of expressing their enthusiasm. MUFON, through your Director, has established a working relationship with the recently organized \"Institute for Extraterrestrial Research\" with head offices nt Via Cavour, 57, Rome 00184, Italy. Through personal meetings with most of their officers, we found them to be the caliber of people having similar goals and objectives to that of MUFON, and therefore an ideal organization to represent MUFON in Italy. Mr. Claudio Gallo, Operations Director, was selected by their Board of Directors with the endorsement of the MUFON International Director, as MUFON's new Liaison Representative for Italy. Mr. Gallo resides at Via Papiria 68/B, Rome 00175, Italy. During a dinner meeting in Rome, in my honor, I had the privilege of meeting personally with Franco Sclano, responsible for Organization and Lojig Range Planning; Mr. Daniele Bedini, Data Processing Manager from Florence, Italy; Miss Daniela Giordano, Foreign Relations; Giulio Perrone, Director of the Institute for Extraterrestrial Research and his lovely wife Anna, who were my personal hosts, plus 30 additional members and their spouses. On another occasion, David W. Davenport and his gracious wife entertained your Director at their apartment in \"Old Rome,\" preceeding a fantastic dinner accompanied by Claudio Gallo, and Mr. and Mrs. Giujio Perrone. David W. Davenport and Ettore Vincenti are the co-authors of the 1979 copyrighted book \"2000 A.C. Distruzione Antomica\" 1 (2000 B.C. Atomic - Destruction) published in Italian and soon to be translated into English - for greater distribution. Mr. Davenport has submitted an article concerning the results of his linguistic/archaeological research into the probability that an atomic type explosion took place in 2000 B.C. in the city of Lanka in what is now northern India. The photographic record was done by Ettore Vincenti. David's article will be published in a future issue of the Journal and will appeal to those people who have specialized in the ancient 18 astronaut culture. Mr. Davenport is a Sanskrit scholar and has access to these writings, plus those he personally possesses. (Your Director had an opportunity to view these individual strips of Sanskrit lettering on parchment that are fastened together so they may be fanned-out for study and reading. David has made drawings of a spacecraft as described in these ancient writings. He expects to learn about the propulsion system as he continues his study into this intriguing material. I advised him that both MUFON and VISIT are anxious to share the results of his work and to scientifically evaluate the power plant described for engineering validity. The Institute for Extraterrestrial Research is composed of people formerly associated with Centre Ufologico Nazionale. We look forward to working closely with Sr. Claudio Gallo, Giulio Perrone, and their very qualified team. Mr. Perrone is an executive with RAI, the Rome radio and television network. Most of the officers of .the Institute speak English, therefore a communications barrier does. not exist. David Davenport, a linguist and archaeologist, was born in India, educated at Cambridge in England, and speaks 12 languages. David played the key roje in all three of the meetings that I had with their group in Rome. Their gracious hospitality made me feel like a visiting dignitary, for which I will be forever grateful. Many of our Journal readers have inquired about the Group I motion picture titled \"UFOs Are Real\" and when it will be released after having had four \"sneak\" previews last November. Stanton Friedman, the scientific consultant for the film, has not been able to determine why it was not released to the motion picture theaters. In March, the Academy of Science and Horror Motion Pictures awarded the film \"the Best Scientific Motion Picture for 1979.\" It is available on a cassette video tape in either Beta or VHS from your Fotomat store for a rental fee of $9.95 or may be purchased for $49.95. Many MUFON people appear in this 110 minute color video tape documentary such as Stanton Friedman, Ted Phillips, Marjorie Fish, Dr. Bruce Maccabee, etc. plus numerous dignitaries in the military and government. This film is a bargain for people who own or have access to video tape equipment. Stanton T. Friedman, a featured speaker for our 1980 MUFON UFO Symposium, has published the papers that he delivered at MUFON's 1977 and 1979 symposiums; his non-winning entry in the Cutty Sark UFO paper competition (June 1979) titled \"Fiction, Facts, and Flying Saucers\"; and a paper he gave in 1975 in Los Angeles to the A.I .A. A. titled \"A Scientific Approach to Flying Saucer Behavior\". This booklet may be purchased for $3.00 by writing to UFORI, P.O.B. 502, Union City, CA 94587. The April 1980 issue of \"73 Magazine for Radio Amateurs\" has an article titled \"Hams on the Trail of UFOs\" by David L. Dobbs K8NQN, of Cincinnati, Ohio. David is an active member of several of MUFON's amateur radio nets. The article concerns the motion picture that was shown to radar specialists in the military during the 1953 era in which a crashed UFO and three small bodies were displayed. Since one of these radar specialists is now a ham operator, David hopes that other hams will advise him if they also saw this film. While we are speaking of \"hams,\" Alfred LaVorgna WA20QJ of Hicksville, N.Y., has designed a QSL card specifically for the MUFON NET, which he calls an \"enigma.\" It depicts two humanoids with the words \"Welcome MUFON Net\" on the front and the QSO specifics on the back in the conventional format. This QSL card may be reproduced in a future issue of the Journal. On April 18, 1980, Doubleday released the hardback book by Hugh Cochrane titled \"Gateway to Oblivion: The Great Lakes Bermuda Triangle,\" priced at $10.00 (183 pages). Mr. Cochrane is not a member of MUFON, however he does quote one case as reported by a MUFON Field Invcstgator in his book. This book would appeal to the people intrigued by the Bermuda Triangle mystery. •."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Lucius Parish In Others' Words Worldwide UFO reports are increasing dramatically, according to Charles Tucker of Indiana's International UFO Investigative Bureau, as reported in the April 1 issue of NATIONAL ENQUIRER. An article in the April 8 issue reports on the UFO study group set up within Britian's House of Lords, largely due to the efforts of Lord Clancarty, otherwise known as UFO author Brinsley Le Poer Trench. A multi-part series on UFO activity in the Soviet Union begins in the April 15 issue, with UFO photos supposedly taken over Moscow and reports of UFO occupants seen in/near their vehicles. The April 22 issue's installment of the series tells of a landed UFO in a remote area of the Caucasus and the reactions of four Soviet scientists who approached the object. The March sightings of UFOs by police officers at Gladstone, Michigan, are the subject of an aricle in the April 8 issue of THE STAR. Criticism of a recent article in THE STAR has come from MUFON UFO Journal columnist Ann Druffel, whose book (written with D. Scott Rogo), THE TUJUNGA CANYON CONTACTS, is now set for June release by Prentice-Hall. The March 18 issue of THE STAR contained an article about the book, which Mrs. Druffel says, \"...contains eight major factual errors (not to mention the typos)....it doesn't even mention the major premise of our book, which is that a ufologist and a parapsychologist have combined their expertise to interpret the same sets of data....they even misidentified Scott's photo as one of the hypnotists who conducted one of the regressions in the cases....the publisher sold the rights for the article to THE STAR; Scott and I had nothing to say about it.\" All of which just goes to point up (again) the necessity to keep your salt shaker at hand when reading the weekly tabloids. In a previous column I reviewed the 2-record set, \"UFO Encounters,\" which is available from Investigative Research Associates, Inc., Suite W, 430 West Diversey Parkway, Chicago, IL 60614. Due to a typesetting error, the price was incorrectly given as $8.95; the correct price is $9.95. I am told that a cassette version is also available from the same address for $11.95. The \"UFO Update\" column in April OMNI contains Harry Lebelson's somewhat-less-than-complimentary opinion of the \"UFO 79\" conference held in San Diego, Calif., in November, 1979. Allan Hendry of CUFOS contributes an article to the May issue of FATE, summarizing the experience of Minnesota Deputy Sheriff Val Johnson and giving results of tests conducted on Johnson's police car which was damaged by a low-flying UFO. The May issue of PROBE is the first \"new\" issue to appear on newstands since PROBE has resumed publication on a regular basis. It is now to be brought out on a bi-monthly basis. Unfortunately, Ufologist Richard Zimmerman is no longer with the magazine, but the May issue has a \"UFO Update\" column, plus an article by Robert B. Klinn on the UFO files amassed by the Condon Committee. Doubleday's massive volume, THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF UFOs, is officially set for release in May. The price for the hardcover edition will be $24.95, with the paperback selling for $12.95. I Mark R.

From all advance indications, the number of attendees will be second only to San Francisco in 1979. John Schuessler and his talented committee have provided all of the ingredients for a high caliber symposium that will appeal to both the space engineer and the interested UFO \"buff\". On the international level, Ilkka Serra, MUFON Representative for Finland; Jean-Francois Gille, MUFON Consultant in Physics, Paris, France; and Dr. Alain Esterle, Head of GEPAN in Toulouse, France, were on the speaking program. Dr. Esterle shared the Saturday evening session with Stanton T. Friedman. The tour of the NASA Johnson Space Center on Sunday afternoon was a memorable experience for many of the participants. All of the members of VISIT, the host organization, are to be commended for their outstanding accomplishments in conducting another successful symposium. It is with regret that we accept the resignation of Bill Pitts as State Director for Arkansas. Bill will continue to give talks on UFOs in his travels and to report sightings in Arkansas to MUFON and CUFOS. As many readers will remember, Mr. Pitts sponsored the very unique and enjoyable \"Ft. Smith UFO Conference\" on October 18 and 19, 1975. Even though Bill will be assuming a secondary role, both Bill Pitts and your Director proudly announce that William D. Leet, formerly a State Section Director, has accepted our invitation to fill the important post of State Director for Arkansas. Mr. Leet has a wide background that extends from a U.S.A.F. combat pilot in World War II and Korea, U.S.A.F. command pilot and Judge Advocate, Hospital Administrator, author, historian; to his present position of Director of Cultural History, Texarkana Historical Museum. Bill earned a Juris Doctor degree. He resides at 1304 East 48th Street, Texarkana, AR 75502. James M. McCampbell, MUFON Director for Research, has welcomed two new members to our Advisory Board of Consultants. Irwin Wieder, Ph.D., a space scientist, will serve as a Consultant in Physics. Dr. Wieder lives at 459 Panchita Way, Los Altos, CA 94022. Also from the west coast, Scott Osborne, Ph.D., a university professor, living at 9517 N.E. 180th, #B307, Bothell, WA 98011 has volunteered to devote his talent as a Consultant in Mathematics. George D. Fawcett, MUFON State Director for North Carolina and Assistant State Director, Mrs. Gayle C. McBride, have announced that the \"4th Annual MUFON of North Carolina UFO Confab\" wOl be held in Winston- Salem on Saturday and Sunday June 21 and 22. See details elsewhere in this issue. Mr. Fawcett and his North Carolina MUFON organization are to be congratulated for the interest they have created in N.C. and the caliber of field investigators that they have developed through their training sessions. George is currently teaching a UFO class at Lincoln County Campus of Gaston College in Dallas, N.C. MUFON North Carolina has over 70 members located in over 45 towns and cities. Since Joe Gumey resigned as MUFON Director of Publications, after editing the 1976 MUFON UFO Symposium Proceedings, this position on the Board of Directors has been vacant. Your Director has been composing and editing the proceedings, starting with the 1977 edition. It is gratifying to have found a competent and talented writer, in nearby San Antonio to share the duties and responsibilities of editing and preparing the layout for our annual symposium proceedings for 1980. Dennis W. Stacey is self-employed and a freelance journalist. He has a B.A. in English Literature from the University of Texas, Austin, and has had several significant articles on UFOs accepted and published by one of the major syndicates. Mr. Stacy has been appointed to the Board of Directors as Director of Publications. He has also consented to become a Staff Writer for the MUFON UFO Journal and is anticipating meeting many of our Journal readers at the symposium in Clear Lake City, Texas, on June 7th and 8th. Marvin Taylor, Assistant State Director for Northern California and a speaker at the 1979 MUFON Symposium in San Francisco, is sponsoring a \"UFO Mini-Symposium\" for Saturday and Sunday, June 14 and 15 at the Tuolumne Fairgrounds Bldg. in Sonora, California. Speakers presently scheduled are Thomas Gates, Paul C. Cerny, and Marvin Taylor. The auditorium will seat 1,000 people, therefore we encourage our enthusiastic MUFON members in California to avail themselves of this opportunity. Please contact Mr. Taylor at 20811 Briarwood Drive, Sonora, CA 95370 or by telephone (209) 532-5216 for additional information. MUFON has more members in Northern California than in any other section of the United States, which was evident at the 1979 MUFON Symposium in San Francisco: The Tarheel UFO Study Group's special issue of their publication for April 1980 included The MUFON UFO Journal subscription form, and an application for Membership form for (Continued on page 18)"}]
