FROM THE EDITOR In this issue we take a brief respite from abduction cases (manuscripts are backlogged) to examine such \"old-fashioned\" matters as scientific evidence of UFOs, government secrecy, and the like. We will unavoidably return to the abduction reports in the next few issues: they continue in the United States, Canada, France, Poland, and Scotland and cannot be ignored. We are currently polling psychological and medical specialists and will soon present a \"mini-symposium\" probing the meaning of abduction cases and proper methods for investigating and evaluating them. Taken at face value, the reports would seem to indicate that beings from elsewhere are forcibly intruding into our lives — examining and testing us for purposes unknown. But can they be taken at face value, or are subtle psychological forces at play that may have a more mundane explanation? Since alleged abductions are dominating ufology, we must clear the air and decide whether they are legitimately the central question or merely a psychological spin-off of some kind that serves only to obscure serious evidence of other kinds.

Anyone desiring additional information may contact the author at 10706 Meadowhill Rd., Silver Spring, Md 20901.) Historical Perspective The New Zealand radar-visual-photographic sightings took place during the morning of December 31, 1978. Subsequent news coverage created enough N.Z. governmental interest so that the Royal N.Z. Air Force conducted its own investigation. Certain physicists of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR), William Ireland among them, were asked to help, After the investigation, the Air Force issued a press release saying that the sightings were results of unusual atmospheric effects off the coast of New Zealand. These atmospheric effects caused Venus to appear above the horizon about 10 minutes early, according to the DSIR scientists. At the request of Channel 0 (now Channel 10) of Melbourne, Australia, I investigated this case and talked to several of the DSIR scientists. Several months later when my report was substantially complete (part of which was published by MUFON in the May and June 1979 issues), I sent the report to DSIR for their comments. I also published a technical analysis of part of the UFO film in a respected physics journal -.Applied Optics (August 1,1979, p. 2527). This prompted the DSIR scientists to further analyze the case and to provide a rebuttal to my claim that an intensive investigation had failed to identify the source of the light. A rebuttal appeared in Applied Optics (December 1, 1979, p. 3889). In addition, William Ireland then published a DSIR technical report (DSIR Report No. 659, December 1979) in which he presented explanations for all of the events of December 31 as well as for the December 21 and early January 1979 sightings. A condensed version of the DSIR report, along with my comments, is presented here to bring MUFON members up to date. Further information will become available later this spring upon publication of a book by Captain Startup, the aircraft pilot during the December 31 sightings, in conjunction with other witnesses of anomalous events in New Zealand during December 1978. (Note: The excerpts from Ireland's paper follow. Remarks by Dr. Maccabee are labelled \"Comments\" and appear in this distinctive typeface. Reference numbers are from Ireland's original text and bibliography.-Editor) INTRODUCTION A \"spate\" of sightings of lights in the night sky (\"UFOs\") in New Zealand (Figure 1) began near midnight on 20 December 1978, when the Flight Service Unit at Woodbourne Airport reported \"several white lights similar to landing lights in the sky\". 1 At 2 a.m. the crew of an in-flight newspaper delivery aircraft were alerted to several anomalous echoes on the 50 cm surveillance radar at Wellington. (Anomalous radar returns are not uncommon on this radar; earlier in the week a number had been observed.) 2 The aircrew saw several unidentified lights, and one unidentified echo on their 3 cm weather radar, during their return flights between Woodbourne and Christchurch. 3 . Ten days later, on the morning of 31 December 1978, the newspaper delivery aircraft carried a TV film crew who intended to obtain film for a news story covering the 21 December sighting. The aircrew and passengers saw, and the cameraman photographed, unidentified lights. The Wellington radar operator was notifed and he verified that the radar was showing anomalous returns. A \"UFO hunt\" developed, and the events included a spectacular \"UFO\" filming on the return flight from Christchurch. The film was shown on TV around the world.\" In addition to the radar and in-flight sightings in the -Wellington-Christchurch area, there were sightings of a light in the eastern sky from many places throughout New Zealand. The most numerous of these took place in the Wairarapa, where the \"Riversdale UFO\" arose predictably shortly after 3 a.m. for over a week. It was extensively photographed. 5 By 2 January sufficient interest had been aroused for the air force to fly a maritime patrol aircraft in the general area of the December sightings. They attempted to obtain in-flight sightings to match the anomalous radar returns being observed on the Wellington and Ghristchurch radars, but no unidentified lights or craft were encountered. 6 An observer from the PEL Environmental Physics Division was stationed at the Wellington Airport Control Centre that night, and witnessed many of the anomalous returns seen on the radar screen after midnight. 7 A TV film crew at Clarence River on the night of 2 January photographed a light which first appeared at about 3.15 a.m. in (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"(New Zealand, Continued)    .    \" the eastern sky, and was still visible at dawn on 3 January. 8 A second TV film crew was sent to Clarence River the following night, accompanied by the PEL observer who had been at Wellington Control Centre the night before. Venus was seen rising at 3:15 a.m. For a few minutes after it first appeared it showed the effects of variable atmospheric refraction, but soon settled down to a normal rising of the planet. 9 The next PEL observations were made on the nights of 5 January and 7 January, when three teams of observers from the Geophysical Observatory, Christchurch, went to the Kaikoura-Clarence River coast to make visual observations, and an observer from the Environmental Physics Division was stationed at Wellington Control Centre. 10 No unidentified lights were seen either night, and nothing unusual appeared on the radar on the first night. On the second night the radar showed many unidentified returns; echoes were also received from Banks Peninsula, normally well over the radar horizon. The radar screen was photographed. The newspaper, television and radio news reporters reflecting the public interest, presented numerous items relating to the sightings and to UFOs generally. They sought comments from those in a position to know about unusual radar, atmospheric, and astronomical phenomena, both at the time and subsequently, and wherever possible published the comments made. Some people still feel that at least one of the sightings has not been adequately explained. 12 Others are convinced that UFOs visited New Zealand last summer. METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS The typical situation in late December 1978 and early January 1979 was one of an anticyclone centred west of Northland. The predominant wind flow across New Zealand was from the west at some 10-15 m/s (20-30 knots), and the surface, wind at Christchurch was often from the east. Daytime temperatures at ground level were of the order of 23°C over much of the country, falling overnight to some 12°C at Christchurch aiiU 15°C at Wellington. The temperature of the sea surface was of the order of 17°C in the Wellington-Christchurch area.   .    . Upper air sounding balloons were released daily from Christchurch, measuring temperature and relative humidity. 22 The pre-midnight flights on the nights of 20 December, 30 December, 3 January, and 7 January showed that conditions were similar — a temperature inversion of about 1°C from the ground up to a height of about 500 metres, then a falling temperature, but falling much more slowly than in a normal atmosphere. .The effect of this temperature distribution would be to make the atmosphere very stable because vertical mixing would.be inhibited. Under these conditions the atmosphere becomes horizontally stratified and sharp boundaries may develop between layers of air of different.history. This effect showed up very clearly in the curves for relative humidity, where the air above 5 km on 20 December, 3 km on 30 December, 7 km on 3 January, and 3 km on 7 January, quickly became very dry.  . . .... - .. ' Using the meteorological data for the night of 30 December as representative of the atmosphere, ray tracing calculations show that the atmosphere as a whole caused little bending over and above that for a standard atmosphere. The modelling also shows that the effects of the sharp boundaries would be noticed only under fairly restrictive conditions, when they would momentarily cause erratic changes in apparent position and size of a light, but the position would soon revert to \"normal\". From a moving platform, such as an aircraft, the effect of the sharp boundaries might be to produce \"pulsations\". The presence of the sharp boundaries could have resulted in most unusual viewing conditions, and strange or unfamiliar effects may have been seen by anyone looking at a planet such as Venus. Such mirage effects would decrease in severity as the planet rose high in the sky. COMMENT A: Note Ireland's conclusion that there would be little bending of optical rays in the atmosphere during the night of December 30. During the same night there is little or no evidence of his hypothesized \"sharp boundaries.\" Even if such boundaries existed they would only have noticeable effects for nearly horizontal lines of sight which lie within, just above, or just below these layers. , .   .  . Radio refractivity profiles calculated by Maccabee from the meteorological balloon soundings made,at Christchurch on 20 December and 30 December show that on both nights the radio refractive index changed abruptly. The changes were sufficient to allow radar rays to follow the curvature of the earth. 23 Super-refraction occurred on the mornings of 21 and.31 December 1978, and also on the mornings of 3 and 8 January 1979. Anomalous echoes from Banks Peninsula and other ground reflections from Canterbury were seen on the 50 cm surveillance, radar at Wellington. COMMENT B: Radar blips do not \"just appear\" on a radar scope. They are caused by reflections of radar radiation from \"something\" that is \"out there.\" Anomalous returns are those which are caused by radar reflectors which are not normally detected, although identifiable when detected, and also by radar reflectors which the operator cannot identify. Since the clear air is ruled out as a relfector (the Wellington radar is not sensitive enough to detect clear air turbulence— \"CAT\"), reflections must come from aircraft or from objects (ships, waves, landforms) at surface level. Under conditions of super-refraction the radar rays are bent downward and hit the ground or ocean surface at large distances from the radar antenna. Under such conditions of anomalous propagation objects like ships can be picked up even though the ships are beyond the radar horizon. This could be considered a \"radar mirage;\" and like optical mirages, the amplitude of the reflected radation would depend upon weather conditions and would be quite changeable with time. A boat reflection might appear and disappear as the weather conditions changed.    :"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Ireland implies here that a super-refractive duct on the night of December 30 could have bent rays down to the surface and thus surface reflectors (waves, boats), observed under these \"mirage\" conditions, could account for the anomalous targets. However, as shown in ref. 23, the weak duct to which Ireland has referred was at about 3400 meters, while the radar antenna was at about 520 m., so rays from the antenna would travel upward through the duct. The duct was only strong enough to \"trap\" rays which might be \"launched\" within the duct or launched at ve/y small angles with respect to the duct layer. For example, a ray from the antenna launched at an angle of Vi° above horizontal would intersect the duct about 330 km from Wellington. It would be bent downward while travelling through the duct by only about 0.14°, certainly not enough to cause it to hit the surface of the earth (flat earth approximation). (Note: Mathematical discussion omitted.—Editor) Thus Ireland should not have referred to this duct as support for his hypothesis that anomalous targets were caused by super-refractive effects. Ireland has implied that anomalous propagation effects on the night of December 30 were so bad that the radar set picked up Banks Peninsula. However, the radar technician specifically looked for the effects of anomalous propagation and reported not seeing an unusual amount of the land around Wellington, or of the coastline of the South Island, and, specifically, he stated that he did not see Banks Peninsula. In other words, he saw no evidence of the super-refraction referred to by Ireland. This test by the radar technician was made within minutes after one of the significant radar contacts in which it appeared to the air traffic controller that something was flying in formation with the Argosy aircraft (incident #15 of ref. 23; at about 0030:45 Dec. 31, 1978). Ireland has implied that the atmospheric conditions during the nights of December 20, December 30, and January 3 and 7, were all basically the same, causing radar refractive ducts. However, the only data to which he has specifically referred are those of December 30, when the duct at 3400 meters was too weak to have a noticeable effect. He has, therefore, failed to prove that ducting actually occurred on the night of December 30. A graph showing the refractive index versus height on the night of December 20, presented in ref. 23, shows that ducting may have occurred on that night.       . THE RADAR OBSERVATIONS The concurrent sighting of nocturnal lights from Woodbourne and from aircraft east of Clarence/Kaikoura, and the appearance of unusual echoes (described as \"weird\") 23 on the Wellington radar, led the witnesses to associate the observations, the existence of a large brightly-illuminated flying object, at the position of each or even some of the numerous randomly- occurring weird echoes, would be a remarkable phenomenon, worthy of serious study. Indeed the classic \"UFO hunt\" is one where ground-based radar echoes are related to airborne visual observations, 28 the witnesses in the aircraft invariably find lights which appear to be in the same directions as the radar \"targets\". The fact that it is not possible to judge the distance of the light from only one aircraft is invariably overlooked. COMMENT C: Witnesses do not \"invariably\" find lights in the direction of radar targets, as Ireland's own research shows in the next paragraph. The only way to be reasonably sure that a visual target is the same as a radar target is to compare dynamics — relative motion — as a function of time. The RNZAF flew a maritime patrol aircraft in the general area of the December sightings, overnight on 2 January, and conducted just such a \"UFO hunt.\" 6 They attempted to obtain in-flight sightings to match the anomalous echoes being observed on the Wellington and Christchurch radars. No unidentified lights were seen, although several of the anomalous echoes seen on the radars were investigated by the aircrew. In some places the aircraft experienced turbulence. COMMENT D: In some cases radar targets disappeared just before the plane arrived at the location and the plane found turbulence. If the radar was picking up turbulence (unlikely for the Wellington radar) why didn't the blips from the plane and unknown merge? ' A PEL observer (the author) was present at Wellington Airport on the night of 7 January. After comparing his observations with those of the PEL observers on the nights of 2 January 7 and 5 January, 29 and after discussions with the radar operators 30 31 , he concluded that the anomalous echoes seen on the 50 cm surveillance radar at Wellington on the mornings of 21,31 December and 3 January were similar to those he observed on the morning of 8 January. The general consensus of those present at the Wellington Control Centre before midnight on 7 January was that there was an \"inversion\" — witness echoes from mountains such as Ruapehu to confirm this. Banks Peninsula, which is normally over the radar horizon, was also returning a strong echo on the morning of 8 January, and several \"raw video\" photographs show it clearly. COMMENT E: As : pointed out in Comment B the radar technician who looked for indications of anomalous propagation in the early morning of December 31 did not see Banks Peninsula. Anomalous returns which the radar operator could not identify were present all the time, especially between about 1 a.m. and 3 a.m., when there may have been a dozen present at a time. They all had the appearance of aircraft echoes when seen on the .      (Continued on next page) 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"(New Zealand, Continued) MTI (moving target display), but they were generally absent when viewing \"raw video.\" No significance was attached to the movement of the anomalous returns, which were generally found to be moving quickly outwards, because the afterglow was often visible at shorter range. Most of the anomalous returns were noticed in the area off the Kaikoura-Cape Campbell coast, but others occurred in Cook Strait and over Marlborough Province. They generally appeared suddenly and lasted for a short time, rarely for more than a few minutes. On the MTI photograph taken at 0219 an echo composed of three spots appears. This was different from all the others seen. It moved northwards and was identified as a ship seen on \"raw video\" photographs later, moving at about 11 knots, passing Cape Campbell at about 0340. Another ship was tracked from the Brothers westwards for an hour at about 17 knots — this was visible on MTI. The most interesting example was seen to be moving radially outwards at 172° at an erratic 100-150 knots for 10-15 minutes. It was 50-60 nautical miles from Wellington. Although not noticed when it first became visible, it disappeared quite quickly at about 0445.    .     ' A group of three echoes stayed stationary at a location about 15 nautical miles north-east of Christchurch for at least l l / 2 hours. These were seen only with \"raw video\" and would be consistent with ships at anchor, or perhaps fishing. Ships in this position would normally be over the radar horizon and not observable from Wellington.  • ' The radar operator at Wellington was in radio contact with the PEL observers on the Kaikoura coast that night. On 18 different occasions he reported the positions of anomalous echoes or groups of echoes to the visual observers. In only two cases did they see anything near the specified bearings, in each case a ship. One group was identified by the radar operator as a rain shower, but no rain was observed on the ground immediately below the nominated position. The Wellington radar was extensively modified about December 1976, 32 and since then has been more sensitive than previously. There are several monitor scopes, each of which may be separately switched to various modes. One person can be watching a scope in the MTI mode, whilst another is watching a scope showing \"raw video.\" The weird returns seen on the morning of 8 January showed up in the MTI mode, but not on the raw video mode at the same time. The simplest explanation for this apparently startling observation is that in the MTI mode the radar is even more sensitive than in the \"raw video\" mode. (Everything which shows up in the MTI mode would normally show up in the \"raw video\" mode unless the sensitivities differed.) An aircraft shows up clearly in the \"raw video\" mode, but the weird echoes did not. If the weird echoes came from solid objects then it would appear that these objects must have been much smaller than normal aircraft. The implication is that they were very weak reflections from apparently moving, apparently small, targets. COMMENT F: Keeping distance constant, the radar return depends upon target reflectivity and size. The return is characterized by \"radar cross section\" which is an effective area that may not be related to the actual area. A small \"perfect\" flat relfector can produce a radar image similar to that of a much larger highly irregular and \"imperfect\" relfector. Thus weak targets imply weak radar returns or a small effective cross-section and not necessarily that the object creating the reflection is small. A radar echo does not always have to come from a solid object. For example, PEL has operated a radar in Southland almost continously since 1957, recording echoes from the upper atmosphere, at distances out to 1000 km, and at a height of about 100 km. The radar \"angels\" often seen when a radar antenna is pointed directly upwards, and appearing on the radar scope as a \"halo\" or \"glory\", come from a height of only a few hundred metres. 33 Again no solid objects are needed for the radar beam to be reflected back. COMMENT G: Only very special, highly sensitive radar sets can consistently detect returns from the clear atmosphere. There is little likelihood that the Wellington search radar could detect clear air turbulence even at realtively close ranges (less than 10 or 20 km), and certainly not at large ranges (100 km or more).     7 The appearance of radar \"angels\", and the anomalous propagation of radar waves, have long been known to be related to the weather. 33 Indeed, as noted earlier, 13 the wartime radar experiences in New Zealand showed unusual propagation was related to anticyclones and fohn winds. With this background, we should have been surprised if unusual radar echoes had not appeared on the Wellington and Christchurch radars on the nights under discussion. Similarly, the lack of unusual echoes on the night of 5 January was not surprising, as the atmosphere that night was more or less \"normal.\" COMMENT H: Ireland should have presented a radar refractivity graph to \"prove\" that the night of January 5 had a \"normal\" atmosphere.   . If we accept the hypothesis that the weird echoes seen on the Wellington radar were related to the atmospheric conditions prevailing, then we have reasonable grounds to expect that the apparent coincidences of the ground radar echoes, and nocturnal lights seen from aircraft, were largely unrelated. On the other hand, echoes seen on the short range weather radar of an aircraft, may often be correctly associated with an illuminated craft seen concurrently from the aircraft. Such sightings did occur during the period, and it appears that in one case the illuminated craft was mistaken for a UFO, when the simple 6"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"assumption that it was a ship was sufficient.  . COMMENT I: Ireland has argued that there were sufficient anomalous radar targets to account for apparent coincidences between Wellington search radar target positions and observed lights. However, most of the radar targets reported on the nights of December 20 and December 30 were in the Clarence River area just off the coast. Had planes flown through these areas, coincidental sightings might be expected. However, in several cases radar targets were reported in close vicinity to the planes while the planes were far from the Clarence River area, so \"coincidences\" were far less likely. Also, there were similarities in dynamics between radar and visual targets which make mere coincidence less likely. Note that Ireland accepts the coincidence between the visual sighting and the short range weather radar detection of one \"illuminated craft.\" The reader will note comments on the \"squid boat\" explanation further on in this paper. EVENT DESCRIPTIONS .• . . .  (a) Possible Planet Sightings; 1. Jupiter . .- At 2350 NZDT on 20 December 1978 the Orderly Officer and the Duty Air Traffic Controller at RNZAF Base Woodbourne saw what they believed to be three lights of a Bristol freighter going towards Wellington. The lights appeared to move upwards and around in a rectangular pattern but at random speed. There appeared to be one large bright orange light and two less intense white lights. At one stage the lights appeared to rush forwards (towards the observers?) but generally they seemed to move northwards and eventually fade. The lights were observed for about 50 minutes at a bearing of about 60° true. The Wellington Control Centre log entry at 0035 NZDT 21 December recorded that \"several white lights similar to landing lights in the sky\" had been seen from Woodbourne....Jupiter is the fourth brightest celestial object, of magnitude -2.1, following the Sun, Moon, and Venus in order of brilliance. It would have risen over the sea, some half-hour before the first sighting, at 232° NZDT, 65° east. By 2350 Jupiter would have been 4.5° above the horizon, 59.9° east, and by 0040, about the time the lights were last observed by the witness, 12.2° above the horizon 50.8° east.... During at least, some of the time of this sighting the Wellington radar was receiving echoes from the vicinity of Clarence, nowhere near the bearing on which the lights were seen from Woodbourne. Whatever the Wellington radar was recording was not therefore the unfamiliar object or objects being seen from Woodbourne. It is suggested that the planet Jupiter was the most likely source of light in this sighting. . COMMENT J: Ireland gave a highly abbreviated version of the initial sightings of the night of December 20/21, explaining one as Jupiter. Later on aircraft were asked to investigate radar targets. The aircraft related sightings are discussed further on in this paper. The descriptions of the unusuallights had the following non-Jupiter characteristics: (a) three lights; (b) motion in a rectangular pattern; (c) one large bright orange and two less intense white. Also the lesser lights moved back and forth, sometimes at rather large angular displacements from the larger light. The bearing of the lights, quoted as about 60° by Ireland (thereby approximating the position of Jupiter), was actually closer to 100-130°, since they were described as moving left and right over the Wither Hills, as seen from Blenheim Airport. Moreover, the angular elevation was greater than-12°, since that is the approximate angle of elevation of the ridgeline, and possibly as great as 20°. Thus it appears that Jupiter was not the source of this sighting.  , Ireland mentions the radar detections of targets near the mouth of the Clarence River, which is about 70 km due south of the Blenheim (bearing of about 180°) and correctly notes that the radar targets were \"nowhere near\" the bearing, as seen from Woodbourne airbase, of the unusual lights. However, Ireland has not mentioned the apparent correlation of motions of the lights, which was checked on a minute by minute basis by direct communications between Woodbourne and the Wellington radar. It appeared that when the lights moved to the right (southwards) the radar targets moved away from Wellington in a southwards direction, and vice versa when the lights moved to the left. 2. Venus Depending upon the observing location and the date, Venus rose within a few minutes of 0308-0336 NZDT in late December 1978 and early January 1979. The rising point at sea level and zero elevation would be about 21° south of east. The planet would climb towards the north against a background of dim stars, reaching an elevation of about 28° some 4° north of east at sunrise at about 0550 NZDT. ,         : The moon was new in late December; it passed Venus on 26 December and disappeared from the night sky on 29 December. It did not appear again in the morning sky until 7 January, passing Venus on 25 January. So for the period 29 December-8 January Venus was the brightest object in the heavens between 3:10 a.m. and sunrise. Given a clear sky a person with reasonable eyesight would have noticed Venus as the most conspicuous \"star\" at some 8° elevation in the eastern sky at about 4 a.m.,     .  . . There were many observations between 21 December and 10 January of a bright light in the eastern morning sky. Reports came from places at least as far apart as Whangarei and Invercargill, and the time when given accurately was always later than (Continued on next page) - •   ••   7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"(New Zealand, Continued) 0310 NZDT. The first observation in this category was of a very bright light variously described as massive, a bright orb, pear- shaped with a reddish tinge that then turned white. It was first seen from an aircraft as it climbed through cloud at about 10,000 ft. somewhat north-east of Clarence, at 0328 NZDT on the morning of 21 December 1978, only 3y 2 hours after the first lights were seen from Woodbourne. 34 The light was to the east of the aircraft and appeared to be airborne and stationary. If it went behind a cloud the glow could still be seen, then it would \"pop back into sight.\" About the time of this sighting of a light from the aircraft, the Wellington radar was also picking up a return which apparently tracked and kept pace with the aircraft for about 19 km. 34 The aircrew did not identify the light to be coming from the position of the \"object\" showing on the Wellington radar. ' A few minutes later, at 0335 NZDT, 35 a very bright light was observed low in the sky east of Woodbourne aerodrome. It is tempting to associate the view from the aircraft off Clarence and that from Woodbourne. A bright light was seen to the east in both cases; in order for the source to be the same it would need to be a celestial body, and Venus was already risen in the east. From the aircraft Venus would rise at about 0318 (allowing for refraction), but it would be obscured by cloud until the aircraft rose through the cloud layer, which we are told occurred at about 0328. Venus would have finally cleared an extended horizontal cloud layer no sooner than about 0332. From the ground at Woodbourne Venus would rise over the hills at 0338; the reported sighting time was 0335.      . • The newspapers reported the pilot as rejecting the suggestion that they may have been looking at Venus with the statement, \"I know Venus when I see it!\" 34 The pilot's answer to the question, \"Where was Venus whilst you were watching this light?\" would b£ interesting. It is difficult to imagine that neither the aircrew, nor the observer at Woodbourne, saw Venus at the same time as their very bright light, and failed to mention seeing Venus as well. The most likely explanation of these two independent sightings is that they did in fact see Venus in unusually clear air when the planet was particularly bright, and failed to recognise it. the radar echoes remain unidentified but this does not necessarily imply that a UFO was responsible for them. COMMENT K: The sighting by Capt. Verne Powell of a bright light to the east of the aircraft came just after Wellington radar told him of a target which previously had been stationary, and which had suddenly moved relatively close to the plane and had started to travel along with the plane. Powell did place the light in the apparent location given by radar. Moreover, as the plane flew along the light appeared to keep pace, and, when the radar target stopped moving the light \"dropped behind\" the aircraft. Again Ireland has obtained his information from newspapers and has thus left out some interesting details. For example, the radar target which \"paced\" Powell's plane had first been seen to move from the Cook Strait toward the southeast at about 120 knots; it then stayed motionless for a period of time until an Argosy plane piloted by Capt. John Handle flew south toward Christchurch. The radar target moved rapidly toward the plane and then remained motionless as the plane continued. When the second Argosy plane, piloted by Capt. Powell, came along the target started to pace it. Ireland has referred toa very bright light low in the sky as seen from Woodbourne at 0335 NZDT. He has shown that Venus would not rise over the hills until about 0338. Despite this discrepancy, he assumes that the light was Venus rising 3 minutes early because of unusual atmospheric conditions. The next sufficiently well reported sightings of interest were both on 3 January, the TV1 film crew episode at Clarence, 8 and the first appearance of the \"Riverside UFO\". 5 The light seen at Clarence first became visible with a reddish tinge moving at low level over the treetops at about 0315 NZDT. The camera crew stopped photographing it at 6:45 a.m. when it was high in the sky, still visible, long after sunrise. The light was estimated by one of the witnesses to be three times as bright as the average star. Another said it was rotating on its axis and pulsating, while the third witness said it was.definitely moving: When they fixed their camera on it, it moved out of the field of view. A second light appeared to flare up suddenly beside the first. Although the TV film crew thought they had photographed a UFO, it has now been generally accepted that they in fact were looking at Venus. 36 If this is so, then the peculiar appearance, irregular motion and changes of shape of the planet must be explained in terms of anomalous optical refraction. For the record, Venus would have risen at Clarence (at sea level, allowing for normal atmospheric refraction) at 0314 ] /£ NZDT, 22° south of east, on 3 January 1979, At 6:45 a.m. Venus would have been 38° abbue the horizon, 76.5° east. COMMENT L: People familiar with the study of UFO phenomena are well aware of the multitude of ways in which Venus has been perceived over the years. Ireland has here \"rediscovered\" the world's \"most popular UFO.\" Ireland has left out the much more interesting sightings that took place during the morning of December 21 such as the report by Capt. Powell and his co-pilot of a flashing light which appeared to pass in front of them at the same time that their weather radar was picking up a target ahead of them that moved about 15 miles in 5 seconds (about 10,000 mph or 17,000 km/hr); the reports by the pilot of the other Argosy craft, Capt. Randle, of lights lighting up the sea and land around the mouth of the Clarence River during the plane's trip south to Christchurch and again during its trip north. Much of the information related to these sightings has been recorded and, along with the associated Wellington Air Traffic control tape, is available for analysis. I have not studied the December 21 sightings as closely as the December 31 sightings, and therefore some of the comments I have made here regarding those sightings may be slightly in error. More details will be available in a forthcoming book by Capt. Startup which discusses the sightings on both nights in detail. (Note: About 2 l / 2 pages of Ireland's paper dealing primarily with Venus sightings are omitted here.--Editor) 8"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"(b) Possible Terrestrial Light Sources Seen From an Aircraft on 31 December 1978 The events which occurred during the \"UFO hunt\" on the early morning flights of the newspaper delivery aircraft on 31 December 1978 have already been well documented by Maccabee. 23 The Wellington Control Centre tape and a tape recording by Fogarty were also available. For the most part, both on the southwards flight commencing from Wellington at about midnight, and the return flight from Christchurch commencing at 0216, unidentified lights were seen at low elevation in the direction of the land. Some of these lights were photographed. The aircraft was flying generally parallel to the coast, about 30 km out to sea at about 4 km elevation. 1. City Lights At about 0010, just after passing Cape Campbell and at a height of about 12,000 ft., the crew became aware of a horizontal row of several lights aboue Kaikoura..(Sometimes there would be one light, sometimes more than one, and sometimes none.) They contacted Wellington at about 0012 and asked the radar operator if he had any targets \"on the Kaikoura Peninsula range\". The reply was that there were targets in their \"1 o'clock\" position, 13 miles ahead. Kaikoura Peninsula at that time was 47 miles ahead in the \"1 o'clock\" position, and an apparent \"radar-visual\" sighting was established, even though the apparent radar and visual ranges differed by some 34 miles. The film crew were called up to the flight deck and commenced photographing the lights (which the aircrew were \"peering\" at) and making a tape recorded commentary. By the time they commenced their observations, about 0015, the unidentified lights were seen to be not directly above the town, but slightly out to sea, at a height much higher than the trees of the town of Kaikoura. The Wellington radar operator continued to advise the aircrew of echoes in various directions between 2 and 12 miles from the aircraft for several minutes, but.apart from the lights over Kaikoura (always more than 23 miles from the aircraft) the witnesses apparently did not see apy lights which they could identify with the radar targets. At about 0022 the aircraft did a 360° left orbit but nothing was seen other than the lights of Kaikoura and the higher lights out to sea. COMMENT M: The film crew did not begin filming the lights, or even making recordings of the events, until about 5 minutes after the crew was called up on the flight deck. They were called up about 0012 or a few minutes earlier. Ireland claims that the lights were seen slightly out to sea. However, the captain has claimed that they were slightly northeast of Kaikoura, if not exactly over Kaikoura, and this would place them inland. Moreover, the sighting line to the unusual lights continually pointed in the direction of Kaikoura as the plane travelled along. The sighting line did not move \"out to sea\" (left of Kaikoura). It is impossible to determine exactly how many times light sources were seen in the directions of radar targets. However, there is one case in the time period mentioned above, that is at about 0015, when radar reported a target at 12:00 (straight ahead) at 10 miles. The captain specifically remembers seeing a light appear for a short time straight ahead of the plane. It appeared as a steady light like the taillight of an aircraft. The next mention of unidentified lights came at about 0027 when two very bright lights appeared directly ahead of the aircraft which had just completed a turn at Kaikoura East and was heading directly towards Christchurch. This is the last recorded mention of the lights ahead of the aircraft until about 0045-0050, when the lights of Christchurch were apparently identified in front.   . COMMENT N: Ireland suggests that the plane had completed a turn at Kaikoura East (turning to the right onto the flight path into Christchurch) at 0027 and that the sighting of two lights which flashed on and off as occurring after the turn. This may be true, but it appears more likely that the plane had not yet turned and did not reach Kaikoura east until 0027-0028. The \"identification\" of the lights of Christchurch referred to by Ireland comes from the reporter's taped messages. He first mentions the lights of Christchurch in the 0045-0050 time frame! However, it seems unreasonable to assume that the pilot and copilot would not have identified the lights of Christchurch much earlier, having flown the route many times before. When the direction of these unidentified lights is projected from the position of the aircraft, we find that the direction given at' 0010,0012, 0015, and 0027 is, in each case, directly towards Christchurch. We also note that, in the absence of clouds, but in an otherwise normal atmosphere, the lights of Christchurch would have first become visible at a range of 235 km from an aircraft flying at 13,000 ft. As near as can be ascertained from the records, the lights were first seen at a range of 240 km from Christchurch at 0010, when the airacraft was climbing past 12,000 ft. The aircraft would have reached 13,000 ft. one minute later. at a range of 234 km from Christchurch. The lights of Christchurch, in the presence of scattered cloud, may then have beer visible sporadically for the remainder of the flight. COMMENT 0: The light which appeared ahead of the aircraft at 0015, referred to in Comment M would have been in a direction about 50° to the left of the direction to Christchurch. The same would be true of the two lights which flashed at about 0027 providing that the plane had not yet turned at Kaikoura East. Thus at 0015 and probably at 0027 the sighting lines were not toward Christchurch. It is curious that the lights of Christchurch were apparently not identified until 0045-0050, 35 to 40 minutes after the earliest (Continued on next page) 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"(New Zealand, Continued) possible sighting in a clear sky. This experience is in marked contrast to that of the crew of the aircraft flying the same route on 21 December. When they were north-east of Clarence, at about 2 a.m. in moonlight, the sky was clear and the lights of Christchurch were visible. Also, the crew of the RNZAF aircraft, when flying over Wellington about midnight on 2 January, saw the lights of a \"squid fleet\" at Mernoo Bank, 300 km away. COMMENT P: Ireland has implied that no one on the plane had identified the lights of Christchurch until 35-40 minutes after the first possible sighting in a clear sky. This would certainly be true of the film crew, who would not know where to look. However, this would not be true of the air crew. There were clouds in the area on 31 December. The records show 1/8 cloud at 4000 ft. over Blenheim, 6/8 cloud at 1200 to 3000 ft over Christchurch. and scattered low cloud over the ocean. The weather above the clouds was CAVU (clear air, visibility unlimited), and the crew described the flying conditions as excellent. A passenger recorded, \"It's a beautiful clear night outside, and naturally we'll be looking out for anything unusual.\" It was one day after new moon, so the sky would have been very dark all night, with the stars clearly visible. The lights of Christchurch cannot be ruled out as the source of this series of UFO sightings. COMMENT Q: Ireland claims that the lights of Christchurch cannot be ruled out as sources of the lights reported during these sightings. However, the available information indicates otherwise. The unusual lights which were reported in the direction of Kaikoura, even appeared to light up the shoreline at times. Occassionally these lights seemed to beam light downwards as would a searchlight. The lights appeared much brighter than the Kaikoura town lights. This seems unreasonable, if the lights were actually city lights in Christchurch, because of the inverse square law and atmospheric extenction effects on light intensity. For example, when the lights were first seen Kaikoura was about 85 km away and Christchurch was about 240 km away, so the Christchurch lights would have been about 50,000 times dimmer than the Kaikoura lights. The light seen at 0015 was not in the direction of Christchurch. The two lights seen at 0027 may not have been in the direction of Christchurch. Finally, Ireland's explanation fails to account for three bright lights photographed by David Crockett. The blue-white images occur in three separate film sequences of, respectively, 121 frames, 32 frames, and 46 frames, at 24 frames/sec. The film was taken during the time period 0017 to 0027, although the exact time is not known. (Other point light images also appear, but they are very dim; it appears that the town of Kaikoura also appears very briefly, but in this case the lights are so dim that one sees a general \"glow\" rather than individual lights. Photographic enhancement would be of value in determining the nature of the weak images.) The first of these lights is definitely at the right side of the aircraft, because on film the image is seen to slide rapidly to the right and off the screen as the camera was rotated to the left, and several seconds later the cockpit is seen to slide onto the screen from the left: Exactly how far to the right is unknown. The other two lights are photographed with no apparent reference to the inside of the plane. Ref. 23 discusses two frames (images) taken from the sequence showing the first bluish white light that was filmed. It is pointed out that the focused image is quite bright indicating good exposure of the film. The question arises as to whether or not a Christchurch light could produce such exposure. The required intensity of a light at Christchurch which could produce such an exposure would be about 8,000 million candelas, a value perhaps comparable to the whole of Christchurch taken as one source. Even for a source at Kaikoura or along the coast the required intensity would be several hundred thousand candelas. This should be compared with a streetlight with an intensity in the neighborhood of 1000-5000 candelas. Thus it appears that both the visual descriptions and photographic evidence are inconsistent with the hypothesis that the \"UFO\" lights were actually lights from Christchurch.

The basic details were reported in Journal No. 139, September 1979. As he drove toward the light, it seemed to rush at him and the interior of his car was brilliantly illuminated. Johnson heard glass breaking, his car skidded, and he passed out. Later, it was discovered that both his wristwatch and car clock were running about 14 minutes slow. The windshield was shattered, radio antennae were bent, one headlight was broken out, along with other dents and damage. Johnson suffered from what appeared to be \"welder's burns\" to his eyes — redness, irritation, and light sensitivity. Allan Hendry of the Center for UFO Studies investigated promptly, and arranged for analysis of the various physical evidence. The following results are summarized from the International UFO Reporter, November 1979. (CUFOS, 1609 Sherman Ave., Suite 207, Evanston, IL 60201). The windshield was examined by an expert from the Glass Division of Ford Motor Company. The four fractures of interest were all on the driver's side. The safety glass had a middle layer of plastic which was not torn. Tests indicated that the fractures were due to mechanical forces, not thermal stresses. The first fracture was reconstructed to be on the inside of the windshield, apparently due to an impact at the corresponding point on the exterior. The sequence of fractures is described and mapped in IUR. \"I still have no explanation for what seem to be inward and outward forces acting ' almost simultaneously,\" the investigator said. The antennae, broken glass from the headlight and plastic lens from a rooftop lamp, were analyzed by a group headed by Roland Wardell at the materials testing lab of Honeywell, Inc. (See Mr. Wardell's report, following.) No evidence was found that the antennae had received a physical impact. The bend in the rooftop antennae was smooth, with no cracking of the metal. The headlight glass showed brittle fractures typical of damage by flying particles or debris. The plastic of the rooftop lamp also showed evidence of collision with a particle and of insect damage. Chemical analysis of a deposit at an apparent point of impact on the lamp showed it to be mineral in nature, its constituents typical of rock material. The Honeywell group concluded that all of the glass breakage and dents on the hood were caused by collision with airborne particles. The antennae, however, were not bent by impact, nor did heat seem to be a factor in the bending. The possibilities of a high velocity air blast or some type of electrostatic (or similar) forces were being explored. Their \"best fit\" model was some highly charged electrical \"thing\" with enough mass and momentum to cause the observed effects. Other Tests This brief summary does not cover all of the details of the testing that was done. Allan Hendry and CUFOS are to be commended for the throughness of their investigation. Tests also were made for FAA radar coverage of the area (nothing to account for the sighting), paint samples,.and possible effects on chlorophyll in adjacent foliage. IUR also reviews a series of similar reports from the upper Midwest that occurred between August 27 and October 6. Several involved people in cars encountering \"aggressive\" lights, bright illumination, and physical effects. •^Q V JV '' : \"-'^~ • \\-''^' : •'•t : P : '.-'. Alan Hendry, Center for UFO Studies According to IUR, Deputy Johnson enjoys a solid reputation in his community, and is puzzled about what happened to him. His eye problem cleared up quickly and he is in good health. Several weeks after the incident he had a brief bout with headaches and a small growth inside one eyelid, but these have since cleared tip. He does not want publicity or attention. The' doctors who treated his eyes all agreed that no natural source of light could have caused the symptoms he had. The source of brilliant illumination and the force that bent the antennae and stopped his watch and clock remain unexplained. Interim Report to Sheriff Brekke, Marshall County, Regarding Incident Involving Patrol Car #407 on August 27, 1979 By Roland D. Wardell (Note: The author is a metallurgical engineer in the Honeywell Metallurgical and Chemical Laboratories) Throughout this report the five submitted samples will have the (continued on next page) 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"(Minnesota, Continued) following identification:  : Top Antenna — The antenna from the roof mounting on the car. Rear Antenna — The antenna from the trunk lid mount. Headlight Glass A — Pieces of headlight glass from the inboard headlight (left set of headlights). Headlight Glass B — Same source as Headlight Glass A except consisting of smaller pieces which were picked up from the highway. Toplight Glass — Perforated red lens and broken pieces of the light (including relfector) which had been mounted on top of the vehicle, left side, facing forwards. Visual Examination Instrumentation Used: Bausch and Lomb stereo optical microscope, magnifications adjustable at 10X, 20X and SOX. Top Antenna (visual exam): The antenna had been bent at an angle of 65° from vertical, 6 l / 2 inches from the larger diameter base end. Deposits of insect debris and roadway matter covered the forward facing surfaces of the part with a noticeable cleaner surface in the area located at the bend. The bend had occurred smoothly with no cracking of the metal at either the outside bend or any other location. No impact marks resulting from collision with \"pieces\" of any kind (except insects) were evident. The small ball at the tip of the antenna showed two paint rub marks such as expected from driving through a garage door without adequate overhead clearance. The paint marks were blue and white. Rear Antenna (visual exam): The antenna was bent at an angle of approximately 80° from the vertical with a bend radius of 1/2 in. occuring 36 1/8 inches from the larger diameter base. Similar to the top antenna, profuse insect debris covered the forward edge but became of lesser degree in the lower portion. The lower portion undoubtedly was protected by the location behind the rear window. As with the top antenna, the bend area was cleaner. Apparently the insect deposits flake off from the bending stress. The small metal ball at the tip of the antenna was unusually bright in appearance with insect debris only at the base of the ball. This antenna also \"showed no cracking but had fairly smooth bend area. Comparing the antenna to the pictures taken immediately following the incident, it appears some straightening had occurred, probably from handling. Headlight Glass A (visual exam): Pieces of glass showed brittle fractures typical of glass breaking from collision with flying particles. Pieces from both the reflector portion and lens were included in the sample. On the broken glass pieces were numerous insect deposits. Headlight Glass B (visual exam): Much the same as Headlight Glass A, only containing smaller pieces. Toplight Glass (visual exam): This sample consisted of the red lens and broken pieces from the relector and filament mounting in back. A second filament mount was present in the plastic bag containing the broken glass. In contrast to the broken headlight, this light was not so severely shattered. The red lens showed one hole which was typical of penetration from colliding with a particle. The hole was oblong, being approximately 11/16 in. in length and 1/4 in. wide at one end and 15/32 in. wide at the other. The broken edges exhibited brittle rough fracture, again typical of impact breakage. The red lens also showed insect debris similar to the other parts. The reflector portion of the light was broken and one broken edge exhibited a brown deposit which appeared to be at a point of impact. The deposit had a \"sprayed out\" appearance characteristic of being struck by a particle which dusts or fractures in the impact. The qualitative analysis of this deposit indicated it to be mineral in nature, containing silicon, aluminum, iron and calcium. This is quite typical of rock material. Tests for Presence of Radioactive Materials The intent of these tests was to find any radioactive residue or any secondary radiation from material exposure to a high level of radiation. All five of the submitted samples were tested with a Nuclear Chicago Deputy Sheriff Val Johnson The Fund for UFO Research, Box 277, Mt.

One probe tested for alpha radiation, the other for hard beta and gamma. A third radiation test was performed on sample \"Headlight Glass B.\" This sample was of small enough size to place in the Nuclear Chicago scintillation counter. In all of these tests, only normal background radiation was evident. No. evidence of unusual radioactivity was present. Magnetic Tests (Antennas Only) Instrumentation Used: Walker Flux meter mod. MF3A, with a 100 turn, 6 cm 2 area search coil. Besides the two antennas involved, a third antenna, a spare owned by a member of the laboratory staff, was also tested. Each part was tested three times. The results are as follows: 12"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Reading Rear Antenna Top Antenna Spare Antenna 1 ,2 3 Avg. 1 2 3 1 2 3 56 56 56 56 40 40 40 40 225 225 230 226.7 Maxwell Turns Maxwell Turns Maxwell Turns Maxwell Turns =.09 Oersteds Maxwel| Turns Maxwell Turns Maxwell Turns =:07 Oersteds Maxwell Turns Maxwell Turns Maxwell Turns =0.38 Oersteds The residual magnetism measured is not unusual. The higher reading on the spare part is likely due to different material and different magnetic exposure. Hardness Tests (Antennas Only) Instrumentation Used: Wilson Superficial Rockwell, 15N; Wilson Tukon Micro Hardness Tester. The intent of the hardness readings was twofold, one, to determine if any heat affects were evident in the metal, and two, to determine approximate \"temper\" for determining forces to bend the parts. Because of the small diameter of the parts, and because the bend area is the significant point of interest, only the top antenna was tested. That part presented larger diameter material at the point of interest and made Rockwell hardness testing feasible but not very accurate. The readings are indicated on Sketch A all in Rockwell 15N. ' The readings indicate no softening of the metal. The material is similar to a \"spring temper\" steel. We tried unsuccessfully to obtain hardness readings in the exact bend area with the microhardness tester. The error in performing that test on a curved, rough surface was too great to conclude anything. An exact test would require cutting and polishing a specimen. tfx - '-' t; ' '•>' '• '.'.' ' Deputy Sheriff's car after skidding to a halt Discussion It is apparent that the involved car collided with several discrete particles. From the analysis of the deposit left on the broken top light reflector, they were mineral in nature and /most likely stones, probably from the roadside. Points of impact are definitely present on the hood of the car, on the windshield and on the top light. All of the glass breakage and hood indentation is indicated to be from the impact with airborne pieces. I am not certain how the \"stones\" became airborne. Any high speed vehicle travelling near the ground would likely kick up stones. The antennas were not bent from stones striking them. No impact marks of any kind were evident on the antennas. Heat does not seem to be a factor in the bending. . I am pursuing two possibilities of causes for the bending. One, a high velocity air blast superimposed on the air movement over the fast moving car. We know from rough calculation, and the metal properties, that a force of only . (continued on next page) 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"(Minnesota, Continued) a few pounds applied uniformly to the antennas, could cause bending. That force would be in addition to the forces from the 65 mph air flowing over the car. 1 am pursuing that calculation further. The other possibility that is far more difficult to investigate, is concerned with some type of electrostatic (or similar) forces causing the whole series of events. HAPPENINGS RELATIVE TO THE AUGUST 27 INCIDENT Much of the analysis performed and reported in the previous interim report is used, along with reported facts, to try to obtain a \"picture\" of the event. To accomplish this, the seven associated phenomena for happenings are discussed individually, and finally the best \"fit\" of what might cause all of these happenings is discussed. 1. Intense light First it occurred in the shape of a beam, then became over- whelmingly bright. The beam like, shape of the light suggests an unnatural source, using lenses, etc.'. 2. Glass breakage There are definite signs of impact; analysis shows residue at one fracture containing iron, silicon, aluminum and calcium. These elements are typical of rock fragments. The direction of the impacting media is evident from location of breakage and imprint on indent on the hood of the car. The relative angle of attack on the car is near horizontal. The speed of the car being 60-65 mph, would tend to create a relative impact angle near horizontal. 3. Engine stoppage The stoppage was not due to a mechanical failure as evidenced by the fact that the car functioned normally following the incident. The engine stoppage points heavily to temporary disruption of the electrical system. 4. Driver unconscious for a period up to 40 minutes It is not clear whether the bump on Sketch A the head could have caused this or if other \"phenomena\" might be the source of unconsciousness. To function, the body's nervous system relies on electro-chemical signals. Could there have been disruption of this by electrical means? 5. Malfunction of the automobile clock and wristwatch This was of a temporary nature, much as the engine failure. Disruption of the electrical clock could very well coincide with the \"failure\" of the engine electrical system. The failure of the mechanical wrist watch would of necessity be of a different form, but again the temporary nature suggest a \"malfunction\" that \"dissipates.\" 6. Radio malfunction At the time of this writing, it is not known whether the radio had permanent damage other than bent antennas. Electrical forces are well known to affect radios. 7. Bent Antennas Considerable effort was made to solve the problem of the bent antennas. The metal hardness tells us that they were not exposed to a general high temperature that caused bending. Normally, an antenna subjected to a uniform force, would bend at the base. However, on a car traveling 60-65 mph, the antennas are consider- ably flexed towards the rear. A force from above, superimposed on the flexed antennas could bend the parts in the manner exhibited. As no impact marks are evident, the. force must have been of a relatively uniform kind — that is, not from a series of particle impacts. A few pounds of force applied to the areas involved would bend the parts. The kinds of phenomena capable of performing this bending includes electrical, fluid (air) and of course \"hand\" forces. Discussion: The \"best fit\" describes a highly charged electrical \"thing\" with enough mass and momentum to create the effects. The question arises whether natural phenomena such as lightning (ball or otherwise) could likely cause all these happenings. Two factors discount this. One, the sustained horizontal beam-like appearance of the light (unlike lightning) and the need for mass to accomplish the events. The disruption of the electrical systems points heavily to something electrical in nature, and certainly enough force must be generated to bend the antennas. Super strong electrical fields can produce these effects. My advisor on electrostatic forces indicates that an electrical field capable of producing the forces involved would be of an intensity to cause arcing to the car. The round ball on .one antenna is \"cleaned\" as if this may have happened. The source of these \"effects,\" whether from a space vehicle or earthly in nature, is of course speculative.

According to the AFP news service in Rome, the Italian Ministry of Defense has published a formerly secret report describing UFO sightings in 1977. \"All these testimonies are extremely important,\" said the story, \"since they come from highly qualified technicians capable of distinguishing between the different phenomena that may be seen in the sky....\" On the night of August 3/4, three employees of the control tower at Naples airport observed a circular UFO giving off intense white light.

At the press conference October 25, 1979, described by Larry Bryant (No. 144, February 1980), Gersten released to the press a series of documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. Two of the more intriguing were internal CIA reports showing strong interest in UFOs. In a memorandum to the CIA Director dated December 2, 1952, H. Marshall Chadwell, Assistant Director for Scientific Intelligence said-- Recent reports reaching CIA indicated that further action was desirable and another briefing by the cognizant A-2 and ATIC personnel was held on 25 November. At this time, the reports of incidents convince us that there is something going on that, must have immediate attention..;.Sightings of unexplained objects .at great altitudes and travelling at high speeds in the vicinity of major U.S. defense installations are of such nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or known types of aerial vehicles. CIA cognizance of the 1952 sighting wave led to formation of the Robertson panel in 1953. Recently CIA spokesman have insisted that the agency had no further interest or involvement after that date. Another memorandum July 12, 1955, was addressed to the Acting Assistant Director for Scientific Intelligence, CIA, from the Chief of the Physics and Electronics Division along with an attached cable from Pepperrell AFB, Newfoundland, reporting a UFO sighting-- Essentially, the 'object' was apparently simultaneously observed by a tanker aircraft (KC 97) pilot (visually) and by a . ground radar (type unknown) site 16 (electronically)....In previous cases the dual '(visual and electronic) sightings are mostly of a few minutes duration at most. This one was observed by radar, at least, for 49 minutes. The author also stressed information from the cable indicating that \"pilot of Archie 29 maintained visual contacts with object calling direction changes of object to (radar) site by radio. Direction changes correlated exactly with those painted on scope by controller.\" The cable, dated 6 July, adds that the pilot lost visual, con tact when the UFO reached about 40,000-50,000 feet. Object then accelerated to speed of estimated 500 knots and moved off in N.E. direction 1 painted on scopes. Fighter scrambled when object started to climb, bent weapon (sic) on fighter, no contact made. Radar or visual. At same times radar site was also painting 5 smaller objects on scopes 5-12,000 feet below 'the KC 97's Archie 29 and Archie 91. At 3000 degrees T. (sic; probably 300 degrees—Ed.) 62 miles from station. Objects moving very very fast. Changing direction and azimuth jumping on and off scopes. Forming circular pattern. Changing to line abreast. Traveling 10-20 . miles then 'changing direction. Controller estimates speed in excess of 1500 knots. Also among the released documents were a series of records confirming the incident in January 1965 when A.S. Coleman, a CIA operative, interrogated me. (I was at the time Assistant Director of the National - Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena.) The express purpose was to gather information about recent UFO sightings in the Washington, D.C., area. Several case files were borrowed and later \"returned. The new documents indicate, according to CAUS analyst Brad Sparks, that the CIA was considering establishing me as a \"source\" and a security clearance was suggested. In fact, as he started to leave my office, Mr. Coleman asked me where I was born and where I went to school. Of interest is the fact that in a 1973 letter to Larry Bryant, a CIA counsel confirmed—but misrepresented—the meeting. He referred only to my loaning some \"publications.\" The counsel added that \"There . was no further contact with Mr. Hall...and the Agency had no further interest in the subject of UFOs.\" It is doubtful whether this was a deliberate . attempt at deception; however, there was further contact and Mr. Coleman did show further interest in UFOs. At the 1965 meeting, Mr. Coleman gave me his phone number \"in case interesting new reports are received\" (or Words to that effect). Many weeks later I decided to test his interest. I called and offered him copies of some high-quality investigation reports we had received. He asked me to mail them to a post office box address. I did, and they were later returned. Thus the interest was in UFO investigation reports (not \"publications\"). The important point is that CIA awareness of serious UFO reports and interest in obtaining them for study is now documented at least for 1952, 1955, 1957 (when the CIA obtained data from Ralph Mayher about his 1952 movie film of a UFO), and 1965. Also, references in military agency reports of major UFO sightings in the 1970'sshow CIA involvement and/or interest. Although it is not possible at present to fill in the years in between, .current documentation proves that the interest has been more than a transient one in .1952-53. D MUFON 103 OLDTOWNE RD.

The Third National Congress of Ufology and the First International Congress of Extraterrestrial Science was held in the city of Posadas, Misiones province, Argentina, on December 7, 8 and 9, 1979, organized by the Argentine Federation of Studies of Extraterrestrial Science (FAECE). The meeting place was the Auditorium of the Medical Center of Misiones and the group CIFE., head of the Northeastern Regional, was in charge of the organization. Mr. Sergio Toscano, Regional Director, welcomed the participants, pointing out the importance of this national and international meeting since, he said, \"the question of the Unidentified Flying Object has already been set aside, as we consider it is only a means of transportation. What is important now is to learn the science that much more advanced civilizations may bring us for the advancement of mankind.\" Mr. Eduardo Ficarotti, President of FAECE, then reiterated this Federation's objectives, stating among other things: \"to try to unite national ufology independently of the different tendencies or approaches there may be on this subject; to massively divulge in a serious and honest way, without any kind of speculation, everything that concerns the possibility of intra or extraterrestrial life; to commence a direct relationship with investigators and centers from other parts of the world joining efforts towards common objectives.\" The following papers were presented: Mr. Oscar Alemanno (San Lorenzo, Santa Fe province): \"The mysterious planet Mars\"; IVE Group (Rosario, Sante Fe): \"Legendology, a new discipline\"; Ruth Gerstel (Buenos Aires): \"Do contacts exist\"?; Vicente Cecilio Rodriguez (Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires prov.): \"Aims of the extraterrestrial collaboration\"; CIC Group (Venado Tuerto, Santa Fe): \"Contacts in Venado Tuerto\"; Marta Paillet (Santa Fe); \"Thoughts on man and his habitat\"; collaboration from Andreas Faber Kaiser (Spain): \"Dangerous game in the Mediter- ranean\"; Group JEM: \"Radionic Machine\"; Adolfo Di Lorenzo and Eduardo Dib (Santa pe and Rio Cuarto- Cordoba province, resp.): \"From Homo Sapiens or the victim of Man\"; AOA Group (Rosario-Santa Fe): \"Ufology, Ufolatry, UFOmania and Extraterrestrial Science\". ICIVE (San Justo, Bs. Aires prov.): \"Whence comes man and whence UFOs may come from\"; collaboration from Dr. R. Leo Sprinkle: (USA): \"Sari Channel\"; collaboration from William Spauldihg (USA): \"Information Retrievals: a case for UFO cover-up\"; ACESPI Group (Mendoza prov.): \"Existential food\"; Helen Kopcke (Buenos Aires): \"Multiple sightings\"; IVE Group (Rosario): \"Good or evil or ice and fire\"; SIU Group (Buenos Aires): \"What UFOs are\" and \"The La Dulce incident\"; SIFPOVNI Group (Posadas, Misiones prov.): \"General Campos case\"; Jane Thomas (Buenos Aires): \"The End and the Beginning\", by Terence Dickinson; CIAR Group (Rosario): \"The pyramid, a source of endless energy\"; Prof. Italo Diaz (Posadas): \"Man and the Cosmos\"; Faruk Alem (Mendoza): \"Paranormal phenomena in Mendoza\"; ADA Group (Rosario): \"Contribution to the UFO investigation\"; CIFE group (Posadas): \"Possibilities of extraterrestrial life\". As a complement, practical tests were made with the Kirlian camera. On Saturday, at 0300 p.m., the General Ordinary Meeting of FAECE was held, at which time 16 groups and private investigators from different parts of the country were incorporated. Closing: The Under-Secretary of the Government, Mr. Juan C. Couette, attended in representation of the Government of Misiones, as also Ret. Navy Capt. Ruben N. Paccagnini and the Chief Commander of the National Gendarmerie, Mr. Dardo Chavez. At this time the National Secretary of FAECE, Mr. Robert Rovere, thanked the municipal government for the donation of a lot where the Astronomical Observatory of Posadas will be erected, its construction being in charge of CIFE, same to constitute the city's patrimony. Conclusion: This congress was one more positive step for the members of the Federation in an operative process that began with the first meeting held one year ago in Rosario. It should be pointed out in this respect that the responsibility of its organization should have been assumed in such a short time, informing 22 countries of the existence of FAECE, of its objectives, working methods, and results that are being obtained. On the other hand, it was once more stated that Extraterrestrial Science embraces all the disciplines that with their particularities and precise methods might contribute to the understanding, not only of the UFOs' physical aspect, but try to answer bigger questions that relate to the existence of life outside of planet Earth.—Committee of Records, Rosario-December, 1979 FOLLOW-UP Bob Pratt of the National Enquirer has informed the Journal that he checked with CBS-TV about the object shown on screen during a football game (See \"NFL-UFO?\" January issue). He was told that the object was a kite-like reflector device called-what else?-the \"UFO.\" 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"BOOK REVIEW UFO Phenomena and the Behavioral Scientist, edited by Richard F. Haines (Scarecrow Press, Inc., Metuchen, N.J., 1979), 464 pages, $18.50 We are at a point in history where mankind expects and receives a scientific \"miracle\" every day. Globs of hot gases have been found in outer space, the gluon identified by researchers, space shuttles are poised to fly to worlds unknown, and the computer is now part of our daily lives. It is no wonder that the ordinary citizen is ready to accept unidentified flying objects as just another part of that daily miracle. Some UFO investigators, people knowledgable of the literature and lore, accept UFO reports far too uncritically. When one hears that a scientist is examinging a UFO incident, the natural assumption is that the scientist is examining a UFO incident, That assumption should include the psychologist, sociologist, and anthropologist. UFO Phenomena and the Behavorial Scientist is an important addition to the UFO research data base. The book is divided into four related sections: Cultural Factors, Eyewitness Factors, Eyewitness Reporting Factors, and Selected UFO Research Data and Theory, each containing three detailed chapters. The book does not deny the possibility of extraterrestrial life, the extra- dimensional component, landing trace effects, or any of the other varied aspects of the phenomenon. Instead, the purpose is to study the reporters of UFO phenomena rather than the UFO reports themselves. This is an important first step. The various chapters are written by individuals holding responsible positons in their respective fields while also having in-depth, intimate knowledge about the UFO phenomena. This situation is clearly demonstrated in the chapter on the Carl Higdon UFO incident presented by Dr. R. Leo Sprinkle. Dr. Sprinkle takes a very critical approach to the whole field of UFO research. Using the Higdon case as an example he presents the initial background information, direct interview text, reference to the clinical hypnotherapy technique, examination of physical evidence, polygraph results, psychiatric evaluation, results, and the results of psychological inventories. He obtained reactions from other investigators and discussed the results he obtained. The resulting summary raises questions about the reality of the case, what can be concluded, and how this experience changes the abductee's life. Perhaps the most important factor is that it shows what the witness must be willing to go through if a case is to be fully investigated. Few witnesses are prepared for such exposure of their personal lives. The chapter by Dr. Haines comparing UFO drawings by eyewitnesses and non-eyewitnesses is most enlightening. He is concerned about the complexities in drawing pictures of UFOs as well as analyzing their content. It is interesting to note that the study shows that people who claim to have seen a UFO draw less obviously ludicrous shapes, fewer domes on the main body, fewer round openings on the body, and a number of other interesting characteristics. A wealth of information is available here. 'Each chapter is written in a manner acceptable to the experienced researcher, as well as the casual reader.

Greatest elongation west (28 degrees) occurs on the 2nd, but this is a classic example of an unfavorable greatest elongation. Venus — Greatest elongation east (46 degrees) occurs on the 5th, and throughout the month, the planet is well up in the west at sunset, and sets about 4 hours later. Early in the month, it passes south of the Pleiades cluster and later passes north of the Hyades, being 9 degrees north of Aldebaran on the 15th. The crescent moon is part of this display around the 18th. Mars — In Leo, it is high in the southeast at sunset, and sets about 2 hours before sunrise. It passes 1.8 degrees north of Regulus on the 29th. The Waxing Moon joins the display (with Jupiter and Saturn) around the 24th. Jupiter — In Leo, it is well up in the southeast at sunset, and sets about 2 hours before sunrise. Saturn — In Leo, it is well up in the southeast at sunset and sets before sunrise.

Stringfield's new booklet, published by the Mutual UFO Network, Inc. and titled \"The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome,\" have been pouring in after his 3-hour program on radio station WLW in Cincinnati, Ohio, on February 25th. He has also appeared on Channel 9 in Cincinnati. Leonard's patient and painstaking research over the past few years, into what many considered only an unconfirmed rumor, has produced astounding eyewitness testimonies that provide dates, places, detailed descriptions, and in some cases the witnesses name. Some of the witnesses presently occupy sensitive positions in our government, industry, or are retired military personnel and have provided this confidential information under the conditions that their names are not disclosed. Exposure of information concerning crashed UFOs and numerous preserved small bodies will provide an incentive to motivate others to come forward .with their first-hand observations or reveal new sources. Leonard has been offered a significant amount of money by a weekly tabloid to disclose the names of at least two key witnesses, which he has declined. Since he would be betraying the confidence of the witnesses, he 'would not only eliminate these people as sources for additional material, but close the door to anyone else that wanted to volunteer new information. Any profits from the sale of the booklets is being donated by Mr. Stringfield to MUFON for UFO research. Leonard serves on the Board of Directors of MUFON as our Director of Public Relations. The booklet may be ordered from MUFON for $5.00 postage paid (air mail is extra).

It appears that he has \"lifted\" drawings from the MUFON UFO Journal on the Liberty, Kentucky, case in the UFO Review No. 7, disregarding the printed copyright. It is a shame that unscrupulous people in the UFO field, one billing himself as \"Mr. UFO,\" should disregard copyrights and publish such material for their own financial gain.
