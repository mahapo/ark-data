They we-e at the top of a hill and almost level with the hovering object, It appeared-as a glowing white disc, While the officers were watching, a single engine aircraft flew icto the area and cir- led t?e object and flew over the UFO. 4-t this point, estimating the ' wing-span of the aFrcraf t at about 20 feet , Gilmore said that the aircraft passed within 500 feet of the object which he estimated to be at least ei&t tunes the wldtli of the ~ircraft wings (150 feet),.
