FROM THE EDITOR The \"mysterious airships\" of 1896-97 in the United States remain a controversial aspect of UFO history. Their performance and ap- pearance did not resemble modern UFOs, yet no historical record is known that could explain them as human constructions. We hope that the \"point-counterpoint\" articles in this issue will stimulate further discussion. Dr. Louis Winkler, astronomy professor, argues that contemporary accounts point a finger at U.S. inventors and experimental flights of prototype airships. Don Berliner, aviation writer, questions how this could be so and raises a number of pertinent objections. We invite comment from researchers knowledgeable about the air- ship mystery, particularly any information or documentation bearing on the \"secret inventor\" hypothesis and the state of contemporary technology.

But in the last decade or two, a new investigative tool has emerged in academe which sheds an entirely dif- ferent light on the mysterious airship flap. The tool is a variety of microforms and readers that are used in connection with a nation-wide, in- terlibrary loan system which provides service copies of microforms. With this instrument it was possible for this writer to make a generous sampling of daily newspapers from the major cities of the U.S. from late 1896 to the spring of 1897, and draw new conclu- sions. The sampling provides detailed evidence of a number of real balloon craft which were steerable or powered (airships). The areas most in- volved show an initial progress of ac- tivity from the west coast to the east coast, over a 5-month period. Reports of the flap start in the San Francisco area, then move to Omaha, Chicago, Nashville, and finally return to the central portion in Texas. News was quickly disseminated with the tele- graph and appeared in countless newspapers. By the time the phenom- ena reached the Midwest, thousands of people were having sightings. And many of the reports would include landing accounts or interaction with the pilot, inventor, or passengers. The nation was a'twitter with the idea that American inventors were close to dis- covering the \"secret\" of powered navigation. These balloon aircraft would just be the first of other major developments soon to follow in the field of transportation by air. Sightings of one or more airships in the U.S. originated in the central coastal area of California during the late fall of 1896. The San Francisco The author invites comment, c/o Dept. of Astronomy, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16801. Chronicle published a series of articles in late November regarding an airship seen-in the Sacramento area with the initial weak suggestion that it was a hoax. Some reports were to the effect that it was cigar-shaped with a frame- work underneath for two men to sit on bicycle-like structures. Other reports were that it was oval with outstretched wings and propellers, and in one instance the operators could be heard singing. By November 22 the Chronicle and the Oakland Tribune reported that \"thousands\" of people saw an airship in the Sacra- mento area. With this ripple, a lawyer, George D. Collins, came to the forefront and explained that his client, E. H. \"Aluminum\" Benjamin, was the in- ventor and had been working on the ship for 7 years. Collins also described some of the flights of the ship, and in- dicated that many parts of it were manufactured in the eastern U.S. The ship apparently was dubbed the \"U.S. Collins\" and supposedly belonged to the Aerial Navigation and Irrigation Co. The sensation was so great the San Francisco Call carried an engraving of an elongated airship with wings, caus- ing the San Francisco Examiner on December 5, 1896 to publish a stiff rejection of the whole affair: Fake journalism has a good deal to answer for, but we do not recall a more discemable exploit in that line than the persistent attempt to make the public believe that the air in this vicinity is populated with airships. It has been manifest for weeks that the whole airship story is pure myth. If this amount of airship coverage bothered the publisher, Mr. Hurst, then what happened in the following months must have made him furious, because by mid-April of 1897 there was a deluge of accounts of airships throughout the country. Additions to and variations of the accounts of the first sightings in California appeared in eastern news- papers during April. The New York Herald of the 12th reported that the first cigar-shaped flying machine was seen on November 16th in the Sacra- mento area, and Collins revealed that this airship was 150 feet long, had two wings, and was controllable. C. A. Smith, president of the Atlantic and Pacific Aerial Navigation Co., in- dicated the airship would fly to the east coast soon. Another story of the first California sighting appeared in the April 18th issue of the Pittsburgh Press. The report here was that the first sighting was in Maryville, some 75 miles northeast of San Francisco. To what extent these California sightings are related is not clear. Concentration Areas Reports of airships died down dur- ing the winter months, but according to the Pittsburgh Press an airship spent several weeks crossing the Rockies, and passed over Kansas and Iowa. Newspaper accounts were renewed when the Chicago Tribune reported on April 7, 1897 that hundreds saw an airship the night before in the Omaha area. The St. Louis Post Dispatch of April 10th, however, reported that Omaha heard of the airship 6 months earlier, suggesting news originated in October of 1896. The New York Herald of April 12th said that the first sighting in the Omaha area was made on- March 29th. Sightings in mid- April were so numerous that the St. Louis Post Dispatch of April 14th and 16th indicated that hundreds had seen it in Nebraska and Oklahoma, and even thousands around St. Louis. By mid-April the airship flap had the Midwest stirred into a frenzy and reports were coming from all direc- tions, but the most developed data came from sightings in the Chicago area. The Chicago Tribune of April (continued on next page) 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Airships, Continued .10th 'reported that hundreds sighted .an airship in the Chicago area, many seeing wings. On the same day, the New York Herald gave insight into the nature of the elongated Chicago ob- ject. Max L. Harrhar, secretary of the Chicago Aeronautical Association, said he was expecting the airship since he received word several weeks prior that a party of three had already left San Francisco. Harmer described the vessel as powered and steerable, and it was just stopping off at Chicago in its flight to Washington D.C. Harrhar also ex- plained that Octave Chanute, presi- dent of the Chicago Aeronautical Association, had full information on the ship. Chanute was reported as be- ing one of the wealthy sponsors of this airship venture. According to the New York Times of June 3, Chanute was running a secret airship farm not far from Chicago, and the New York Herald-of April 13 reported the patent papers for the airship were already on file in Washington, D.C. The Chicago Tribune was able to provide most of the information regarding the inventor of the Chicago airship. On April 12th they reported that the inventor's name was A. C. Clinton who lived in Omaha. The April 26th issue, however, suggested that A. C. Clinton was an alias and the probable inventor was a violin maker Clinton A. Case, an anagram of the alias. According to Secretary Wake- field of the Omaha Exposition, Case requested 87,000 sq. ft. of landing space at the exposition. Then, the next day' the Chicago Tribune reported that Case lived in Chicago and he was already -building model airships since 1892. in'Rock Rapids, Iowa. Perhaps Omaha was mistakenly reported as the home of: the inventor because another inventor, Alva J. -Grover, a civil engineer who resided in Omaha, is reported as having shown plans for a steerable, powered, inflated machine.. But to make things even more confused the New York Herald of April 13th reported that Oscar B. Booth; another airship inventor from Chicago, said the Chicago airship was Charles Clinton's who lived in Dodd City, Kansas. In the technical vein, the most com- pelling evidence for the existence of an airship seen in the Chicago' area was the two photographs taken by Walter McCann which was reported in several of the major newspapers across the nation. Three other witnesses — G. A. Overstocked W. Hoodies, and E. L. Osborne — saw the airship as well as McCann who took the photographs. These photo- graphic plates were subject to \"an acid test\" and pronounced genuine. The witnesses themselves could even see through a telescope a man steering the cigar-shaped airship. Unfortunate- ly these photographs do not seem to have survived. However, among the .more prominent sources which declared the photos a fake were the Chicago Tribune of April 12 and Donald B. Hanlon in 1970. - The Tribune explains that it was a fake because of \"too much scope of lens.\" (?) Another area from which detailed reports issued was Nashville, Ten- nessee. On April 25th the St. Louis Post Dispatch provided a remarkably detailed description of an airship shaped like a shad without its head and tail that landed in the Chat- tanooga area for repairs. In addition to wings and propellers there was a 9-foot passenger car beneath the balloon which carried two men. One of the pilots, Prof. Charles Davidson, reportedly left Sacramento a month earlier. Interestingly enough, the May 7th issue of the Chicago Tribune gives a description of another airship, also in a very convincing style. Prof. Arthur W. Barnard of Nashville • demon- strated take-off and control of a balloon before hundreds at the Ten- nessee Centennial Exposition grounds. His -balloon was elongated with propellers and had a bicycle underneath for the pilot to use, primarily for take-off. The New York Times of May 7th specified the airship length as 40 feet and width as 20 feet. Since we presently live in the .age where humans have been landed on the moorrrepeatedly, it is difficult for us to imagine the sensation created in the horse and buggy days by the ap- pearance of a controlled balloon. The Tribune report indicated that in the case of Barnard's demonstration \"peo- ple refused to believe their eyes.\" The New York Herald of April 14th expressed exasperation with the air- ship situation and said it \"seems impossible to get anything reliable now about the airships.\" They then proceeded to describe a steam driven airship named \"Pegasus\" which had solved the problem of aerial naviga- tion and had spent the last month fly- ing about. This airship was supposed- ly assembled 10 miles from Lafayette, Tennessee with parts from Chicago, Pittsburgh, and St. Louis. Numerous other accounts of inven- tors at work were briefly given in newspapers that spring. According to the Dallas Morning News of April 6th another pioneer, G. M. Padgitt of Springfield, Missouri, had been mak- ing balloon ascensions in the several weeks past. And among the inventors with a reputation who were secretly working at the time was Samuel P. Langley of the Smithsonian Institute. As early as May 14, 1896 the New York Tribune reported that Alexander G. Bell described Langley's invention as a steam driven aerodrome which looked like a large bird. On April 13th the St. Louis Post Dispatch in- dicated that Prof. Henry S. Pritchett of Washington University claimed that Langley's invention was able to carry a man several hundred feet. . Dubious Accounts By no means were all the news-| paper accounts . along the lines of pioneering efforts by inventors of air : ships, secretly or openly. A few of the! stories seemed distinctly different in character because of features difficult or impossible to believe. The New York Herald of, April 12th reported that John A. Hernon, electrician from San Jose, by December 1 had already been on a trip with the inventor of an airship. Over a 2-day period they were supposed to have made a trip to Honolulu and back. This was a trip of over 4,000 miles which had to be made at an average speed of 80 mph. (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Airships, Continued , • . • • ! T , • j . ..-.•_ It is difficult to see, how the westward trip against the prevailing winds could be accomplished in less than 2 days when powered flight of balloons was in its infancy. While the schedule for the trip to Honolulu -stretches the imagination, the schedule for another airship reported by the. Pittsburgh Press is an outright.lie. Here the timing of a flight is given as Jacksonville, Florida 9:43; Havana, .Cuba 9:47 and Duluth, Iowa 9:50. The Dallas Morning News of April 19th contained .a unique account in- volving a crash landing of an airship with retrieval of the pilot's body in the Aurora, Texas area. Part-time reporter E. E. Haydon even provided information that the pilot originated from Mars and had on his person papers with unknown hieroglyphics. No material evidence regarding the airship, pilot, or his papers was ever recovered and the report of the inci- dent is regarded as a hoax. While a few other hoaxes were identified in the newspapers, their perpetrations were relatively simple-minded and rather weakly documented. Among the more curious accounts of airships is the one provided by George Dunlap via the Dallas Morning News of May 16th. Dunlap indicated he inspected a 75-foot long steerable, powered airship near Lake Charles, Louisiana. The airship supposedly car- ried four passengers in its travels through Texas and Mexico and had an inventor named Wilson and engineer, Waters. Although Dunlap indicates he was invited for an ascent, he declined. Incredibly, Wilson was reported as building a total of three airships, the other two supposedly in Arizona and Mexico. Could one of these airships have been the one so widely reported by the Dallas Morn- ing News on April 16th and 17th when it was reported that the pilot was seen working on his craft outside the Dallas area? Ballooning History In both Europe° and America balloonists had been making ascen- sions with passengers for more than a century. As .early as 1783 Jean F.\" P. Rozier'and Marquis d'Arlandres made a free-flight, trip at LaMuette, France and 10 years' later the first Balloon flight'in the U.S. was launched from Philadelphia. Jean P. .Blanchard flew 15 miles across the Delaware River and reached more than 1 mile in altitude. But then what happened be- tween 1793 and 1896 in America does not seem to have been docu- mented in much detail. In Europe, however, there is considerable documentation during the period. By 1880 the first powered airship was flown in Leipzig, Germany by Wolfert and Baumgarten, but it end- ed in disaster. Even up to 1897 Euro- peans were having difficulties with their attempts to achieve successful, controlled, powered flight. In 1884 C. Renard and A. C.. Krebs flew their 170-foot-long \"La France.\" The balloon returned to its starting point after achieving a speed of 12 mph. By 1897 a European dirigible had been powered by a Daimler engine, but un- fortunately their trip ended too in disaster as their engine emitted sparks which ignited the hydrogen gas in the balloon. In the same year another par- tially successful flight . ended in disaster when a Swede, Solomon A. Andree, left Danes Island in an am- bitious attempt to cross the North Pole. Because of incidents like these the New York Herald wrote on April 15th: In Europe there are at least a dozen well-known scientists working, on the problem (of a powered, steerable airship) and many half suc- cessful effects of flights have been made. . It is difficult to compare European and American achievements before 1897 since American reports are not as complete. Nevertheless, American flights also seemed to have their dif- ficulties. Numerous instances of land- ings were cited by Hanlon, Jacques Vallee, and this writer, and of all.of these, five were reported to be for repairs. However, only the St. Louis Republic for April 14th reported a ma- jor crash landing, in Kalamazoo, Michigan.-Here G. W. Somers and W. Chadburn witnessed a blow-up of the airship which showered propeller blades, electric : wire and steel splinters. -.-»..:.i:.n .- :•«?\"!=?•'•' , A measure pf. the ballooning activ- ity from late'l 896 to, trie spring of 1897 is the number of sightings'and landings .reported. Hanlon specifies 150 sightings in 19. states, and this writer adds 1 sighting in each of 4 ad- ditional states and Cuba _and'Mexico from newspaper sources. Vallee and Hanlon documented 22 landings in 12 states, and this writer adds 13 addi- tional landings in 8 states: In America there were at least a dozen inventors working on the problem, however, most were not as well known as were the Europ'ean inventors. It is hardly a surprise that the s'tate . of dirigible technology in the U.S. was\" as ad- vanced as it was with the long arid in- volved history 'of ballooning in Europe and\" America. Early Interpretations To the detriment of UFOIogy and the history of ballooning, one of the first analyses of the mysterious air- ships of 1896-1897-was.made by.the debunker Donald Menzel. In-his cus- tomary glib style the airships were: . . . created from imagination — imagination inflated by the newspaper stories''A? in the 1947 saucer scare, hoaxers and jokers ready to capitalize.on the event, quickly entered the pic- hire.\" - • - ., '.....,  : Naturally this same approach to, the phenomena of 1896-1897 was taken by another debunker, Philip K. Klass. His version is that:. When the public has been conditioned by the news media to believe that there; are strange flying objects in the skies many persons will report having seen such objects — even when the objects do not really exist. Apparently Menzel and Klass would have us believe that half of the major newspapers in the country are not capable of-differentiating between a real phenomenon and a psychological one. .''-.;: . • In keeping with their general', ap- proach .to UFOs, Menzel and Klass are not only glib, they are absurd: In spite of the ^activity' with powered, controlled,, elongated airships in'the areas of -San (Francisco, .Omaha; (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Airships, Continued Chicago, Dallas and Nashville, Klass writes: At the time of the rash of mysterious airships sightings there were no large powered craft in the U.S. . . . Such things as airplanes or airships simply did not exist. Menzel of course has his own ex- planation of how thousands of people over the U.S. had erred even though they saw details with and without op- tical aid: The dark, cigar-shaped gas bag in many cases was only a lenticular cloud or mirage, which would have escaped notice except for the special significance momentarily attached to an object of this shape. The view of the 1896-1897 phenomena taken by Vallee is dif- ferent from that of Menzel and Klass, and not as glib. Vallee suggests that the airship was a figment of the imag- ination, and in 2 of the 21 landing cases he discusses in connection with the airship, he shows that there are similar circumstances in Medieval an- nals of folklore from the British Isles. Vallee also attempts to show that 4 of the remaining 19 landing events are fairy-tale-like. Most of the interpreta- tions of the flap found in the general UFO literature, however, take the view that the airships are not an ex- plained phenomenon. Hanlon closes his Flying Saucer Review article of 1970 with the statement: It is clear that the origin of the airship is still very much an open issue. It is also clear that the mystery surrounding its appearance at that par- ticular time in history has deepened. What is so surprising of the anal- yses mentioned above by Menzel, Klass, Vallee, and Hanlon is that none considered a conventional man-made object explanation. Debunkers and UFOlogists are represented, but no one chose to treat the mountain of compelling data as just part of the history of ballooning. At the time of the airship sightings there did not appear to be any out- spoken debunkers with the reputa- tion of Menzel and Klass. But indeed, there were a few astronomers who simply suggested without much tech- nical defense that thousands upon thousands of people could not distin- guish between a point of light such as Venus, Mars, Alpha Orion, or Betel- geuse, and structured aircraft. Although numerous people saw de- tails of the construction of the ships, including passengers, and although many reliable witnesses made obser- vations with optical aid, the astronomers failed to explain how the observers could have so erred. Perhaps more convincing than the technical arguments of the man-made nature of the flap are the contem- porary opinions of reliable sources. Some of the first supportive commen- tary comes from Pritchitt in the St. Louis Post Dispatch of April 10th and 14th. There is too much corroborative evidence and it comes from too many quarters to treat the matter any other way (than an airship). The newspaper also reported that the populace itself was convinced of the true nature of the phenomenon: It is general belief that an airship is floating over the states of Missouri, Illinois, Iowa and Kansas . . . The majority ridicule the idea that anything beyond the natural has been seen. Even the French newspaper Figaro commented on the believability of the American reports: The news seems to be more than a canard, see- ing the details and preciseness in which are related in the (New York) Herald the exploits of this airship. Although the Philadelphia Inquirer car- ried little on the airship, in the April 17th issue they comment: Airship stories of an apparently entirely reliable character are coming in in rapid succes- sion and all seem to hang together. Conclusions More than 3,000 newspaper issues from among three dozen titles cover- ing the period during late 1896, and between mid-March and mid-May of 1897 were searched for this article. It is very likely that considerably more data remains to be uncovered on the subject of the mysterious airships from newspapers alone. Further, Lucius Parish has informed me that he has had for some time in his posses- sion several hundred pages of airship material. But, although there is much work remaining to be done in con- structing the story of airships in the U.S. during the 19th century, the work done to this point is sufficient for this writer to deduce the true nature of the mysterious airships of 1896-1897. It seems much more rea- sonable to interpret the airship sightings simply as airships which were various models in the develop- ment of the dirigible. Consequently these airships should no longer re- main in the realm of UFOs.

While the thoroughness of his research is commendable, his con- clusions seem to this writer to be rather hard to support in light of the history of airship-related technology. That there could have been powered lighter-than-air craft of unknown manufacture in the late 19th century can hardly be denied. But there could also be vicious cocker spaniels living in oxygen-filled caves on the far side of the Moon! However, in the absence of evidence, such assump- tions are highly risky. And evidence of the actual existence of 19th cen- tury engine-driven airships in the U.S. simply cannot be found. Nowhere in all the vast collections of aeronautical historical material is there a single specific detail about such a device: Not a photograph, not a measure- ment, not an artifact, and not anything else that would suggest that even one of these things flew except in the imaginations of inventors and journalists. And if such a machine had flown, why did it never become public knowledge? The performance de- scribed by hundreds of witnesses strongly suggests highly successful airships: fast, maneuverable, long- ranging. Yet none was ever seen ex- cept at a distance. Where were they built? Where were they based? Where did they end up? And, assum- ing such airships existed, why were they never capitalized upon? Why were none seen at pre-announced public displays, or in showrooms? The first engine-driven airships known to have flown in the U.S. were those of Stevens and Boyce, who flew at Manhattan Beach, N.Y., in 1900. Prior to that, and dating back to 1863, the only powered airships in the U.S. were driven by pedals, like a bicycle, and hence capable only of quite feeble speed and very limited range and duration of flight. Let's face it: pedalling a clumsy great gas-bag against even a gentle breeze is very hard work. And that really points to the major argument against the \"mysterious air- ships\" having been secret U.S. craft: The state of the aeronautical arts in 1896-97 was such that airships having anything like the speed, range, and navigational capabilities of the reported craft would have required enormous advances in technology. Had such advances been made, their non-airship applications would have been so great that to have kept them secret and then let their secrets die would have cost their developers many millions of dollars in sales and royalties, and world-wide fame. The great barrier to the develop- ment of aviation in those days was the absence of efficient engines. Gasoline engines put out a few horsepower and weighed hundreds of pounds; electric and steam power- plants were even worse. It wasn't un- til the Wright Brothers built a 12 hp engine that weighed around 200 Ibs. (crude, by today's standards) that aviation stood a chance. Had an efficient airship engine been available before the turn of the century, it would have found im- mediate application in airplanes, but that never happened. Prior to 1897, only Karl Wolfert, in Germany, had flown an airship with a gasoline engine, and his biggest that flew was less than 6 hp. The performance of known 19th century airships was pathetic, at best, with none capable of as much as 10 mph. Even if suitable engines could have been built in total secrecy, could secret airships have flown where they were reported? Most sightings were at night, and they covered such widespread areas that either there were a large number of airships, or a few that ranged the entire country. Such flying demands some means of navigation, especially at night: the crew must know where they are and they must be able to figure out how to get where they are headed. In 1896 and 1897, there was obviously no air navigation system in the U.S. There were no radio beacons upon which to home. There were no major roads to follow. There were no networks of well-lit cities whose unique patterns of lights would permit identification from the air. Had there been air-to-ground radio in those days, someone on the ground might have been able to keep an air- ship pilot informed about his location. But useful radios were far in the future. (The first use from an airplane was in 1910.) Had our secret inven- tors come up with miraculous im- provements in radio, they would have had to have been nuts to hold back the news. And even if there had been such amazing radios, they would have re- quired power for operation. The bat- teries of the day were huge and weak, and thus would have proven a great drain on the already over-taxed lifting ability of any pre-historic airship. This would have been true to an even greater extent for powerful search- lights said to have emanated from some of the airships. Hundreds of pounds of batteries would have been needed to run them, and their pur- pose is difficult to imagine. What of the reported designs of the airships? Many were said to have had wings, oars, and even paddlewheels. Any of these appendages would have cost an airship far more than it pro- duced, hence the total absence of anything of this sort on known air- ships.

J. (Bill) Vogel, CUFOS in- vestigator, reports a recent sighting that he investigated. During the first week of February 1982 at 3:30 a.m., a police officer was on routine patrol westbound on Highway 220 on the Yakima Indian Reservation in Washington State when he noticed a bright light several miles to the south. Believing a house may have been on fire, he proceeded south oh Lateral C. Because the road was quite rough, he watched the road and lost sight, of the light. At the in- tersection of Lateral C and the Marion Drain Road, the officer stopped and shut off his lights, think- ing that the light may have been from a brush fire along Toppenish Creek, about a mile south of his location. Suddenly two cylindrical-shaped objects with half-moon shapes on their bottoms rose up from behind the trees that lined Toppenish Creek. The objects were on either side of the Lateral C road, and they were as large as a house. The objects gave off bright, white light that illuminated the ground beneath them as they rose. After rising up to 100 to 150 feet, the objects moved south toward Top- penish Ridge (about a mile south of Toppenish Creek) and went up over the 1,500-foot-high ridge. As the ob- jects ascended the ridge, they re- mained generally side by side during flight and described S-shaped flight patterns. As the soundless UFOs moved across the valley floor and up the ridge, the ground beneath was bright- ly illuminated. Duration of sighting from the initial appearance of the ob- jects to their disappearance was about 4 to 5 seconds. The night was clear and windless; the moon was not out. Vogel reports that witnesses have observed during January 1982 a number of bright NLs (nocturnal lights) compared, to single \"head- lights\" which have moved up and down Toppenish Ridge near the loca- tion of the above sighting. Comment, Continued weight and wind resistance, that they would have been a serious handicap to the forward movement of the air- ship. As-for oars and paddlewheels, they would.have done \"as much good as-tying a pair of canaries to the han- dlebars of a modern racing bicycle. There is no recognizable evidence that anyone flew an airship in America prior to 1900. And even if someone had, there would have been no way for it to find its way around the; country at.,night. And many of them were equipped with .gadgets that-make absolutely no sense. If anyone had learned how to do these things in 1896-97, he could have put his. creative brilliance to work in ways that ..would have ranked him, .with Edison: These, rumored inventors may have been eccentric, but could they have been immune to the lure of fame and fortune? - ; Dr. Winkler. has used'his \"new in- vestigative tool\"-to come up with ad- ditional reports, of.airship, sightings and new claims .'of, mysterious inven- tors, none of which resulted in visible hardware. But has he- shown why these, marvellous inventors never led to anything? .On: the-contrary, the development 'of • airships proceeded exactly - as., it. would, have: if the \"mysterious airships\" of 1896-97 had never.been. Dr. Winkler refers to several well- known aeronautical researchers who, he says, were somehow involved with the \"mysterious airships.\" Perhaps he should have paid less at- tention to the obviously flimsy ac- counts in contemporary newspapers and more to what is now known about their works: (1) Prof. Arthur Barnard definitely flew an airship at the St. Louis Exposi- tion in the spring of 1897. But it was purely pedal-powered and hence little more than a novelty. A cross-country flight or a night flight in such a craft would have been quite a stunt, but no more than a stunt. (2) Octave Chanute was one of the leaders in the effort to invent the airplane, not the airship. His work is well known today, and contains not a hint of serious interest in such lighter- than-air craft. As a man quite willing to share his knowledge with others, Chanute would have, been very much out of character to have been part of a large secret group of aerial ex- perimenters. . (3) Prof. Samuel Langley, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, was busy in the 1890's with heavier-than- air flying machines, not airships.iThe \"steam-driven aerodome which looked like a large bird\" reported in May 1896, was his.Aerodome #5, a 25-lb., unmanned model airplane which is considered by historians to have been the first engine-driven, heavier-than-air machine to have flown successfully. On May 6, 1896, it flew three-fifths of a mile. It is now on permanent display in the National Air and Space Museum, which also owns the totally unsuccessful full-size, man-carrying descendant of the #5, which flopped into the Potomac River in late 1903. Obviously, many of the reports were either pure imagination or wild exaggeration. This is true of all categories of UFO reports, as well. It therefore seems to boil down to a couple of basic questions: . (I) Was anything at all seen, or were the airships nonexistent? Since Phil Klass says there's nothing to them, the obvious answer is that something peculiar must have been flying around the U.S.A. in 1896 and 1897. (2) Were the legitimate sightings of unknown American . airships or of UFOs? While it can be argued that unknown airships are UFOs (being unidentified, flying, and objects), the total absence of evidence of any pre-1900 airships strongly suggests that the great fuss was caused by what we now call UFOs.

It was a very successful trip. To describe its glamour would seem like boasting, therefore I only hope that the readers will not get this im- pression, and instead think in terms of how China is paying attention to UFOs. This is my purpose for writing this article.

For the whole day my dwelling in \"Friendship Hotel\" was swarmed with people who asked questions of all kinds.. On the next day, I was invited by the Peking Ching Hua University Stu- dent Union to give a lecture on UFOs. The hall was fully packed. They wanted to know about the U.S. work on UFOs in the past and I told them all that I knew: The third day .was arranged for m'e to deliver a talk on UFOs in the Pe- king Planetarium. The Planetarium has 600 seats. Before 1:30 p.m. they were all occupied. Latecomers had to stand in the aisles and at the back of the hall. My. friend estimated that there were 750 people present. ..

Many UFOlogists, including Fried- man (1973) and Dickinson (1974, 1980), have considered Marjorie Fish's interpretation of Betty Hill's star map as a working hypothesis, that the stars Zeta 1 and 2 Reticuli might be a home base for extraterrestrials. But many skeptics, including Menzel (1977) and Sagan (1980) consider the reported CE-III of Barney and Betty Hill a psychological event and even reject the similarity between the Fish and the Hill map. Statistical computations made by each side regarding the degree to which the two maps agree in ap- pearance is dramatically different. Unfortunately this difference can not be resolved because the size of the statistical cells about the stars employed in the underlying Bernoulli mathematics can not be agreed upon. The protagonists insist on small cells making it highly improbable that ran- dom patterns can duplicate the Hill map, while antagonists insist on large cells making it easy for random pat- terns to duplicate the Hill map. Recently, however, new rejections of the Fish hypothesis have appeared in Frontiers of Science (1981) and in statements by Dickinson (1981), Hen- dry (1981, 1982) and Grain (1981). These reactions are based on observa- tions of Zeta 1 and 2 by Bonneau et al China, Continued can still be the bridge between U.S. and China, facilitating communica- tions between the two countries. Chinese \"UFO fans\" have asked me to deliver this message — they hope that the U.S. UFO experts will visit China at some future date to share their knowledge and UFO investiga- tions. (Paul Dong is the United States Editor of the Chinese-language newsstand magazine the journal of UFO Research.) (1981) and DaSilva and Foy (1980). Arguments here are to the effect that Zeta 1 and/or Zeta 2 are binary in nature and therefore violate Fish's criteria for selection. She only con- sidered those single stars which have solar-like designations. Lower mass stars and double stars were rejected because it didn't seem likely that these objects could evolve life as we know it. The argument against the Fish map further proceeds that if Zeta 1 or 2 were binary, Betty Hill would have drawn it that way, and since she didn't it doesn't represent the Reticulum portion of the sky. The above grounds for rejection of the Fish hypothesis is both premature and too severe. The double nature of Zeta 2 as determined by Bonneau is only a marginal result with the relatively new technique of speckle interfer- ometry. Although the European Southern Observatory's 3.6 meter telescope was used the separation for the supposed companions of Zeta 2 was measured as O.\"046 which is just slightly above the limiting diffraction resolution of the telescope which Bonneau indicates is O.\"038. That these results are at the limit of the capabilities of the instrumentation can be seen from the fact that Bonneau experienced seeing of l.\"5 to 5\", which is two orders of magnitude greater than his results. There is no doubt about the validity of Bonneau's measurements in general because he duplicates results established by other means, but it just happens that Zeta 2 is a marginal, limiting case. The case for Zeta 1 being double is even weaker because Bonneau could not resolve it. with speckle . interfer- ometry, and DaSilva and Foy only. suspected it being double from high dispersion spectra. The observations of Zeta 1 and 2 by Bonneau, and DaSilva and Foy are not unique in their preliminary char- acter. In fact this is often the case because the stars are a good number of light years away and the provi- sional nature of the parameters of many nearby stars is evident when a variety of star catalogs are examined. When Fish first started to match catalog stars with the Hill map she was unable to find a criterion for a satisfactory match. But when the Gliese (1969) catalog was later pub- lished more stars were included and a match was found. Another example of the provisional nature of fun- damental parameters pertaining to Zeta 1 and 2 is found in their paral- laxes. If three catalogs are chosen at random we see about a 30% variation in their distances as shown in the ac- companying table. A third example of uncertainties concerns the double nature of Zeta 2. Although Bonneau resolved Zeta 2 one year, he found that he could not repeat the measurement the follow- ing year. While it is remotely possible that these differences in resolution could be caused by a highly eccentric orbit, the double nature of Zeta 2 probably would have been discov- ered during astrometric programs because the separation of the com- ponents is at least 50 % of its parallax value. Because Betty only drew her map two years after the reported en- counter, inaccuracies should be ex- pected in relative positions and in numbers of stars where close binaries are involved. If inaccuracies are ac- ceptable in Betty's representation of positions, then it should be acceptable in the representations of binaries too. The fact that Fish's final criterion is violated is immaterial since resem- blances of the two maps are based on the positions of single and binary (continued on next page) 10"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"By Ann Druffel Unidentified Occurrence in the Greenhorn Mountains by Howard Ford (Note: Guest columnist Howard Ford is a psychotherapist in Thousand Oaks, Calif., who employs hypnotic techniques in his pro- fessional work.) Tuesday, December 11,1979 was a normal day for Melvin and Naomi, at least until about 2:00 in the after- noon. Then, the strangest thing that they had ever experienced occurred. They lost all awareness of time for over two days and had only partial awareness of a third day. Melvin, a retired aerospace engi- neer who had received honors in the Apollo program, was clearing brush on the back part of his small acreage. It was a beautiful warm sunny day with a gentle breeze and clear sky, ex- cept for an occasional small white puf- fy cloud. He and his wife Naomi had retired to this resort area near Lake Isabella, Calif. Their large, neat mobile home is located at the base of the Greenhorn Mountains, which is the southern end of the Sequoia Na- tional Forest, about 35 miles from Bakersfield and about 50 miles from China Lake. Their property slopes down toward the back where their garage is built. The terrain is rugged with steep mountians surrounding them. Melvin was a very healthy 64-year- old, who had never been hospitalized and had been to a doctor only once in his life when he was given a clean bill of health. He served as a volunteer with the Sheriff's Search and Rescue Team. He is a rather reserved person who prefers a quiet life away from the city. Naomi was a 62-year-old house- wife whose health was reasonably good except for a history of asthma. She had always been very stable emo- tionally with . a positive attitude (continued on next page) Star Map, Continued stars. So if Zeta 2 or 1 or any number of the stars of the Fish map are merely proven to be double it still is not necessarily a reason to reject the Fish hypothesis. In fact it will nqt be possi- ble to make well-founded -claims for or against the existence of regions of stability or habitability for any atten- dant planets of the binaries until some precision is achieved in determining masses, orbital parameters, spectral types, and parallaxes. In any event, the profoundly im- portant question as to whether we have been visited by extraterrestrials deserves more care in answering than has been exhibited with the Reticu- lum region of the sky. This is especial- ly the case with Hendry's articles since they are so poorly thought out. In addition to Friedman's (1981) criticisms, Hendry also makes other fundamental errors. . He seems to think he knows how long it takes for the evolution of advanced in- telligence to take place and even under what chemical circumstances. To say the least, modern science is a long way from understanding the - Zeta 1 Zeta 2 Gliese(l957) O.\"079 0.074 Jenkins(1963) 0.106 0.097 . Gliese(1969) 0.089 0.089 geophysical circumstances under which this biochemical sequence pro- ceeds. In conclusion, either full acceptance or rejection of the Fish hypothesis is premature. While it is difficult to do, we must be patient and view the data only as a working hypothesis until much more definitive data are ac- cumulated. REFERENCES AND BIBLIOGRAPHY Bonneau, D.; A.

Naomi recalls'humerous feelings, visions'and happenings'that \"seem to be-her own experience's, which 'she refers to as hallucinations, dreams, or \"pictures.\" •'' ~ First; a discussion of the things they both'experienced'but have not yet substantiated as reality. There seems to ••• be a : -uniqueness 'about these, because they do not place them in the time' period\" after' consciousness started'-returhing, but during the un- conscious period. Naomi recalls being in an unfamiliar room, the memory'of which she- : refers to-as a \"mental pic- ture.\" The room- was white; \"almost like an operating'room.\" She'iwas ly- ing unclothed • oh a'table for a long time with-legs'and arm's spread apart. The ro'oirTwas absolutely empty ex- cept for ; the gurney-like' table, and measured-about -5 r by 8- feet with white panelled'walls. She felt she was being tilted in different directions'and was fighting- hard to move but was unable to do-so. On one end of'the room the top 'half of the wall panel was open. Her husband came to the open area and started to climb over. The wall- panel' moved upward,: arid she screamed and cried, \"Don't come in ... stay away!\" According to Naomi he responded \"No, I want to be with you,\" to which she replied, \"Oh, don't ... you'll die, too!\" She sensed she was being elevated or levitated upward and feared being \"squashed.\" The panel closed him out. Melvin has no recollection of this en- counter. .- • ' • He remembers clearly, however, being in a \"cubicle\" with four walls, which he estimated to be 5 feet to 8 feet square. Everything was black or r white or varying tones in between. He states, 'There was a\" girl in there with me.'' He-indicated she had \"no features\" and \"everything was gray. She had no color so as to tell if she was black or white or Indian.\" He estimated the \"girl\" .to be his height or above, about 5'10\" or 6'. Melvin •repeatedly stated she was featureless and everything was • gray. • He was uncertain about what she was wear- ing, except that the top and bottom were the same color or tone. He could not understand all of her speech and referred to it as a foreign language; however, when she communicated with him he could understand her clearly. She also spoke with \"her brother and mother who were down below 'them.\" Melvin kept demanding that the girl let him out of the room and she told him to rap on the floor or \"wall a certain way so a panel would 'open and he could \"go free. He says •her attitude was \"'very determined.\" He states he crawled around on the floor knocking on the floor and walls trying to get out. His memories of the room are vivid. He stated \"It is just as vivid today as it was when it hap- pened,\" when the writer interviewed him many months after the event and added, \"I don't know how I got out.\" Both Melvin and Naomi were very impressed with the fact they heard a •continuous sound. They -never iden- tified the time of the sound but did hot place it in the time perio'd after consciousness started returning. He refers to -the sound as a helicopter. She said ; she thought it was a large truck or tractor idling. However, after they had been rescued and were at the hospital, a helicopter \"landed to bring a patient to the hospital, and she immediately said it was the same noise. Naomi felt that Melvin's feet might have been injured because during the ordeal she had seen him walking on \"ice or glass.\" After hospitalization she tried to find justification for the experiences and therefore decided the plastic runner down the hall may have caused her to think he was walk- ing on ice. She had never heard that others have reported that peopfe are levitated in connection with light in some UFO reports. In summarizing the whole occur- rence Naomi adds, \"I had a feeling we were out of the house at one time.\" She also felt she was trying to get out of something. She repeatedly used the word \"they.\" At the hospital, after rescue, Melvin was understood to say he felt his home had been invaded by a \"lady\" who had a powerful influence over him, which had caused him to go out of his house and had left a curse or spell on both of them. He felt that a powerful \"force\" had controlled him. He also said \"a man and a woman entered his house.\" Later, he did not recall making either state- ment. Next we consider the things they both remember consciously even though some of the behavior seems very irregular and confused. They both remember being in the bedroom when they started regaining con- sciousness.and being unable to move with full strength. They remember being cold and unable to get enough clothing to keep warm because they could not walk. Melvin remembers having on only one work boot and looking for the other one. Naomi recalls her leg muscles'paining ter- ribly, which she attributed to her struggling in the white: room. She remembers getting a pistol and throw- ing it to Melvin and also being in the bathroom with the door locked and Melvin trying to get in and planning to chop down the door if necessary: - (continued on next page) 12"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"California Report, Continued They both remember her aunt com- ing to their home twice and the sheriff coming once. In the third category of events there are fragments of confused thinking which Naomi experienced. She thought a whip came in the win- dow in the bedroom and, with a ^ crack, knocked things off the dresser, including her jewelry case whose con- j tents scattered across the floor. This event added to her fear that \"they\" were going to kill her. She saw a hand with a saw cutting the floor out around the night stand. She removed a gun from the night stand and threw it to her husband. He concurs that she threw the gun but does not know anything about the floor being sawed. He recalls her saying when she threw the gun, \"We are going to get some of them before they kill us.\" She was surprised to return to her home about two months later and find the floor and carpet undamaged. During the ordeal Naomi saw ob- jects as black, such as items on the shelves in the hall, the TV, and even her medicine. She recalls telling a neighbor man who came by their house not to give the dog food because \"they\" had \"put holes in it and it was black.\" Thinking \"they\" were using the radio near the bed as a communication device, she grabbed it and threw it to Melvin. She experienced all mirrors like windows or two-way glass and thought people were looking at her. She thought her brother was peeking in the window at her. She was con- \"N. vinced her husband's friend was sit- ting in the bath tub with all his , clothes. She locked the bathroom door to keep \"them\" out and Melvin thought she was hollering to get out. He envisioned the door knob as hav- ing been moved over about 4 inches, so close to the door facing that he could not open it. His neighbor had come ,by. to-play with their dog so Melvin sent him to -the garage to get the ax so he.could chop the door down. When she heard .what he said, she unlocked the door and stayed in the den. .She saw faces everywhere of .people they knew..Even .the afghan had a face on every.little square about one-half inch in size. She saw a \"per- son\" in their home and.objects flying around her. Most of the hallucina- tions Naomi experienced occurred Thursday night, during the day-on Friday, and Friday evening. •• Some time on Friday, Naomi's aunt came to their house. She found them dressed inappropriately in thin night clothes, the bedroom in disarray with a chair on its side, a table lying over with a leg broken off, and a broken glass container with contents spilled. She tried to assist them but could not make sense of their behavior, because Naomi told her everything was \"fine.\" Naomi finally told her aunt to leave; she did, her feelings hurt. A friend of this aunt advised her to go back because something was evident- ly very wrong. She returned and tried again but with little success. She then reported the condition to the sheriff who came to the house. Since they were friends, he \"hollered\" to Melvin, who told him that \"everything was OK.\" The sheriff called to Naomi who also responded that everything was fine. The sheriff left. Finally, on Friday evening, the aunt called the victim's son, who is a businessman in Thousand Oaks, approximately 170 miles away. The son immediately responded, bringing a friend with him. Upon ar- riving, he found his father dressed in pajama bottoms, his mother in a thin night gown..The outside.temperature was 28 degrees and there was no heat in the house. Neither parent would talk to him. He.checked the furnace and discovered the outside • furnace door was open, the heater cover off, and the thermocouple pulled out. This last item would take con- siderable strength. He also discovered both parents had injuries. According to the son, his mother was so cold that when he touched her : it felt like.his hand would stick to her. She also had what has been called a \"burn\" on her left hip and thigh area. Melvin was seriously, injured with a bad \"b ( urn\" on his left hip. which indented the.bone about the length and diameter of a pencil. There was a hole and a \"burn\" about 1% inches frbrri the^top'of'his head toward the f back of his ;head, ap- proximately-the. size, of a.-half dollar. There was also a-\"burn'.' on the put- side of both heels at least the size of-a half dollar. The most.severe injury was on his lower back. It. started below the waist line and reached down about 4 inches, covering,.a width of about 10 inches across his back. Naomi told the investigator later that \"his-: back looked Jike a. huge grizzly bear took a bite-out of it . :. you could see the white.muscles.\" It is not clear if this view was with full consciousness or was part of her hallucinatory state. Their son said the injury was black, swollen, and .raw when he .arrived. .Pictures .were taken of the lower back by a physician about one month after the injury and by the investigator about 11 months after. . . . The son took.Melvin to the local hospital. Since he was. in need .of more sophisticated treatment, they left the small local hospital; and went by to pick up Naomi. She was most resistive to going. Her son rolled .her in a blanket and put her. in .the car, and drove both parents to-the West- lake . Community < Hospital., .in West- lake .Village adjoining--Thousand Oaks.

This investigator (Ford) is in possession of the couple's medical records, and they verify substantially the couple's statements as to the ex- tent of their injuries and mental states when admitted. This Unidentified Occurrence has been speculated on by the medical staff, the victims, and various others as lightning, drug reaction, foul play, fumes, poison, microwaves, radio fre- quency waves from an airplane, eddy current (air to ground and ground to ground), spontaneous human combus- tion, or a CE-III (or IV). Lightning seems ruled out as it was a clear day and no burned spots were found on or in their mobile home. The drug and poison theories were resolved by blood tests at the hospital. Analysis of all food and drink in the home re- vealed nothing irregular. The foul play and robbery theories were negated by the fact that nothing was missing. The injuries were not the kind an intruder might inflict. There were no marks found on or inside the mobile home, therefore it may or may not rule out the eddy current, microwave, and radio wave theories. However, there was soot in some areas of the house, which sug- gests a combustion or electrical arc of some kind. The spontaneous human combustion theory has a similar parallel in various literature and more recently on the \"That's Incredible\" TV program. This series reported a spontaneous combustion which oc- curred to a man who lived through it. Two of the similarities are that both events occurred in an enclosed area surrounded by metal, one location be- ing a mobile home, the other a motor home (camper) and that both victims had similar injuries and both lived.' Is it possible that spontaneous human combustion is less intense when it oc- curs in a metal enclosure? The Close Encounter of the Third Kind theory has a limited amount of evidence pointing to it in this par- ticular case. Both Melvin and Naomi heard a \"noise,\" experienced being in a \"room,\" were aware of the presences of strange persons and had other perceptions similar to those reported by CE-III (and CE-IV) witnesses. Naomi's hallucinations, however, were not of a type com- monly reported in CE-IIIs and CE-IVs. 2 The son's friend who accompanied him to their rescue reported he had never seen anything like the \"spell\" they were under. He served as a pilot in the Vietnam war and now his flights are sometimes routed over the Lake Isabella area. He said he was not going to fly over that area again. Their son continually stated, \"It is the weirdest thing I have ever seen.\" He encouraged them to have the mobile home moved and never go back there. Melvin and Naomi did return, however, after two months. Upon be- ing released from the hospital, they stayed in the area near the hospital for required treatment of the \"burn\" on his back. When they returned home, Naomi was surprised to find every- thing had color instead of being black. However, the windows and TV screen did have a black, sooty film on them. A macrame owl in the kitchen/ hall area was almost black from soot. Nothing else in the den was damaged except some of the drapes. On these were found patches of soot 3 or 4 inches from the ceiling. Their dog was kept at another home for two months. After return- ing and for a year afterward, the dog has shown extreme fear when she sees a kite or a vapor trail left by a jet. She panicks and comes to Melvin trembling and hides. The dog has always been an outside dog and has never acted in this manner before. There have been changes in Naomi's personal life. She returned home physically healthy and shortly afterward shoveled 12 tons of gravel over the driveway and parking'area because Melvin was unable to do it. She experienced some apprehension at first but has now reconciled herself with only a limited amount of fear. She feels she has aged a lot in the way she looks, she tires more easily and her neck, back, and shoulder muscles ache. However, she still feels she is a relaxed person. After returning home she had no asthma for 5 months, but after that time the asthma returned. Melvin feels most of his changes are physical. All of the injuries have healed and are basically trouble-free except his back, which showed one small area that still has not healed when photographed in November 1980. He is limited in the amount of pressure he can tolerate on his back; even lying down is painful. He has ex- tensive nerve damage in one leg which still limits his mobility. On the afternoon of December 10, 1979, the day before the ordeal started, their dog dug into a hill about two feet and came out with a meer- schaum pipe, which had been ap- parently washed up by recent rains. The pipe has some burned material in the bowl which smelled like old tobacco. After the inexplicable hap- pening of December 11, Melvin and Naomi began to think that there was perhaps something from the pipe that caused the problem. They have no logical basis for their assumption, however. The pipe is intricately carved. Their son referred to it as looking \"evil.\" At the present time this case is truly an Unidentified Occurrence. Any in- formation that could relate to this case would be greatly appreciated.

Most spontaneous combustion cases occur in persons of advanced age who live alone. Both the \"That's Incredible\" case and Melvin and Naomi were in their 60s, comparatively young.

Bryant Time was when •! used to offer this rejoinder to a superskeptic of UFO reality: \"All you need to have is for just one of the reported 'unknowns' to be confirmed as an alien spacecraft; the rest, no matter how strange or how mundane by comparison, mere- ly provide some icing on the cake.\" Now, in these' days of escalated claims of \"close encounters,\" the game has improved and the players have acquired new roles. Oh, it's still the old game of hide-and-seek, the ob- ject being certain artifacts of UFO visitation in years past. Only now the seeker no longer is the Government but the citizenry of the Government; the concealer being not the force behind the visitations but the UFO policymakers in the Executive Branch. Against that turn of events, I now should confront the superskeptic with: \"If just one of these accounts of alien spacecraft/creatures being kept in custody of U.S. military authorities happens to be true, then it certainly makes sense for the Air Force to have terminated its obsolete Project Blue Book.\" The pursuit of crashed UFOs/ retrieved UFOnauts, now institution- alized by publication of Leonard H. Stringfield's findings and speculations, has injected new life into the status quo of modern UFOlogy. Until this matter is put to rest, all other present and future efforts at objective UFO research will, in the public's mind at least, amount to so much window dressing. Fed by rumor upon rumor, this Secret of Secrets may be the most fertile ground for organized UFOlogy since the day Edward U. Condon declared the UFO subject unworthy of attention by orthodox science. After all, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ostensibly is holding its UFOlogical breath in down-played hopes that someone, somewhere, someday will present its scientists a bonafide piece of UFO hardware for analysis. What irony if that piece, along with dozens more akin to it, has been gathering cob- webs for three decades in this or that Air Force storage hangar! Irony, of course, knows no bounds in the steady march of UFOlogy toward im- mortal folklore. What's paramount now is perspective. And that's just what Stringfield's evolving \"retrievals\" research is pro- viding us. His is the perspective of the careful, methodical, persevering, seasoned analyst who knows both his own limitations and the limitations of his subject matter. The result — a model for future investigative reporters in the field of UFOlogy — recently was brought up-to-date and published by MUFON as a 38-page monograph entitled The UFO Crash/ Retrieval Syndrome — Status Report II: New Sources, New Data. Documentation Update For readers acquainted with the earlier version of this in-depth chronology of \"retrievals\" case histories and personalities, the current offering will help fill in blanks, cor- rect errors of omission/commission, and promote wider review/debate/ac- ceptance of the findings to date. In- deed, it's not hard to project the suc- cess of this body of documentation to be on a par with the classic NICAP study The UFO Evidence. Even as this column goes to press, the \"Stringfield Report\" (as it's bound to become known) probably is finding its way in- to numerous in-baskets on Capitol Hill. If Congress is on its post-Watergate toes, the Stringfield Report might serve as a catalyst for long-overdue public hearings on the Federal Government's UFO news-manage- ment program. Until then, perhaps the document will serve as the con- science of the Executive Branch, fostering and/or supporting internal dissension over the secrecy policy. Whatever its immediate impact in of- ficial circles, the Stringfield Report certainly will open the door to a new era of UFOlogy, one that will con- tinue to challenge Stringfield's in- vestigative prowess and personal stamina. As a not-too-detached observer of this coming of age of \"retrievals\" research, I have a few suggestions on how Stringfield and his associates might add further substance to their pursuit: • Press on with the gathering of af- fidavits of first-hand testimony; per- suade all such witnesses to go on pub- lic record with their accounts so as to encourage other to do likewise. In this aspect of the politics of UFOlogy, there is safety in numbers. • In instances where there is limited concern about official reprisal for public revelations, enlist the aid of the U.S. Freedom of Information Act to compel government sources to release the documentation pertinent to the witnesses' accounts. • Consult with individual mem- bers and appropriate committee staffs of the Congress so as to establish a climate of immunity for those witnesses (declared and undeclared) who might wish to come forward in a secure forum to air their accounts. • Institute negotiations with high officials of the Executive Branch to have the government issue a blanket \"declaration of immunity from pros- ecution\" for all participants in the \"retrievals\" program and subsequent coverup, with emphasis on the total freedom of each participant to engage in public discussion of his/her involve- ment. Once these steps are taken, the progress made to date might be doubled in a few year's time; and — who knows — maybe by then there'll be no longer a need for this column in the pages of this or any other UFO- research periodical.

It' is aSsUmed\" 'that' such complete disclo- sure lends authenticity to the story in- volyecPanc!' indeed 'is a requirement for\"'believability.' Most UFOlogists have adhered to this principle when- ever possible. Such full disclosure ac- cording to the Journalistic Model has been counter-productive. In many cases,.. foreknowledge that . their names would be published in the popular media has driven away UFO witnesses • and certainly has 'driven away' any'-ihforrhants who cared to comment anonymously about the Crash/Retrieval-Syndrome': 7 •' \" • \" It 'should ' now • be 'clear to- all dedicated'- UFOlogists more than a generation'' after Kenneth Arnold's sighting, that a different manner of reporting UFO information than-the 'Journalistic-'Mode'l- \"is '-required. Perhaps'ariother alternative should be adopted,' Specifically the Medical Model of reporting scientific informa- tion, and do so in,accordance with case history technique. Medical literature ^frequently -has need of describing objective and very per- sonal information about patients. The literature is replete with such case histories. In all cases the patients' anonymity is respected and the pa- tient identified only by initials. These case histories are never challenged on the grounds that the patients full name is not disclosed, and the under : lying integrity of reporting is assumed as a matter of fact. Might it not be useful for us to adopt a similar approach? Both witnesses and informants would thereby ' be protected. Witnesses could then report all their data to serious researchers\" with the clear knowledge that they and their families would never be identified in any publication which might provoke the popular media to descend upon them like locusts at a feast. Infor- mants, many of whom are discussing information that 'is highly classified, perhaps several levels above the well known Top Secret category, may then feel free to \"go public\" with their information\" without fear of retribu- tion. This would encourage others .to come out of the closet, and allow con- siderably more information to devel- op about the Crash/Retrieval Syn- drome.  . . . „ There is obvious journalistic prece- dent for this practice. Journalists are, 'and always have been, very protec- tive of their sources and have insisted in courts of law that their sources re- main anonymous. Legal attempts to force journalists to reveal sources of their 'information have failed. This guaranteed anonymity has served as a mighty bulwark of a free journalism. It could also serve as a mighty bulwark for a more • liberated in- vestigative UFOIogy. •'•'•• I do not think 1 that the criticisms of •Stanton Friedman and William Moore have merit: Their criticisms of String- field's desire to protect the anonymity and safety of his sources stands out- side the bounds of all reasonableness for a variety of reasons. Let me be clear that I respect their work. Still,'I have personally talked to a UFO witness, a CE-III subject, and several military types, and most seek to guard their privacy. It is, quite clear that our first responsibility is to con- sider these people as \"patients\" who first of all need our assistance and sup- port, and who need our guarantee that their privacy'and good faith will not be abused.

Virgil Staff (No. 161, July 1981) has no way of knowing my motive for writing, although that has not prevented him from condemning it. He thinks that I intended to remind UFOlogists that they do not under- stand the source or meaning of the UFO phenomenon. This is quite wrong. My purpose was to remind UFOlogists of the number of assump- tions involved in the many popular hypotheses, and in particular to show that the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH) involves so many assumptions that it stands apart from other mun- dane hypotheses. The ETH involves not only a leap of imagination, it in- volves a leap in the number of assumptions. Staff thinks that I do not believe in the existence of ILE (Intelligent Life Elsewhere). On the contrary. I do not say that aliens do not exist, or that they cannot reach Earth. Indeed, I do not say that no alien craft are cruising our skies. I merely pointed out that belief in all these things involves assumptions and that the likelihood of the belief being correct is inversely proportional to the number of assumptions. It is hardly arrogant to point out the obvious fact that we have not yet determined that ILE ex- ists. If, as Staff claims, my chart is inade- quate, then he is free to produce his own. What \"possible phenomena\" does he think my chart excludes? What \"other factors\" may require in- clusion? I make no \"attempt to locate present day sighting within the chart's Level 3.\" Staff attributes to me an unreasonable motive and then attacks that motive. All I say is that the place- ment of unknowns in Level 4 should not be undertaken until it has been established that the unknown does not fall into Level 3. It is hardly my fault if there are many more mundane explanations for UFOs than are known to UFOlogists. Staff thinks that there is no reason to believe that aliens think like us. On the contrary, beings in control of an advanced technology are bound to think scientifically, as we do. They must use mathematics, as we do. Just as the laws of nature are the same from one end of the universe to the other, so the thinking process of in- telligent beings is bound to follow a similar pattern. To have begun space exploration they would be,.as we are, an energetic, expansionist, race, deter- mined to survive and be survived. In short, -they would be more like us than we would care to admit. Aliens who did not think Jike us are unlikely ever to have developed a technolog- ical civilization, or have..left their home planet. Staff's understanding of Ockham's Razor is rather odd. Certainly the Razor does not claim that hypotheses based on many assumptions are always less likely to be correct than hypotheses based on few .assump- tions. But it does issue a. warning that the assumptions should not be multi- plied beyond necessity. Skill, is re- quired in judging when it. is necessary to add further assumptions. However, the Razor has nothing to., do with \"facts that are not, available\" (if they are not available, how .could they be facts?). Indeed, .the Razor., deals not with facts, but with hypotheses and assumptions. • , My article also dealt with .the scien- tificity of. UFO hypotheses, a matter which Staff has ignored.D.. : Letter, Continued this time Mr. W. C. Stevens had not ^x the slightest idea about the existence of Mr. Meier upon the earthplane. Here in the U.S.A. I duly presented my first, analyzed photographic evidences of the hoax to.my research colleagues, to Stanton T.. Friedman and Jim Lprenzen in 1977/78. Regard- ing these proven facts my ihvestiga,- tion of the Meier hoax extends over 5 years, and not \"one day.\" . . . 2. It is true that in my analysis I called Mr. Meier the \"4th disciple of Jesus Christ\" because according to the, enclosed excerpts of 1 his pamphlet (and more circulars) he declares un :i mistakably his missionary assignment from the Embassy of the Talmud Jm- manuel alias Jesus Christ to declare to humanity the original teachings of Jesus Christ.

It is also a matter of fact that on March 18, 1980, near- Wetzikon, Switzerland, I investigated with Mr. Hans Jacob the famous location of that pine tree, which was circled by Semjase's spacecraft . and photo- graphed by Meier in various positions arnongr the. .twigs (the photos .were widely publicized).

Many region- alized UFO study groups and organ- izations have expressed a serious interest in sending representatives, ac- cepting the invitation extended in the December 1981 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal. It is gratifying to know that so many people are anxious to discuss subjects that will lead to greater cooperation in UFOlogy and the application of their individual talent to help resolve the phenom- enon.. It is the consensus of the key peo- ple, representing the cooperating UFO agencies, that a Sunday after- noon session of 4 hours would be in- adequate to properly address the important issues and allow each repre-' sentative to share his or her ideas and suggestions. It had also produced some conflicts in the Sunday after- noon speaking program at the Sym- posium. Based upon the above condi- tions and the sincere desire to take some major steps for North America in UFOlogy, the entire day of Mon- day, July 5th (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.) will be devoted to this meeting.

We are also soliciting subjects which the different UFO agencies feel should be part of the agenda so as to maximize our efforts. From all indica- tions, this could be the most signifi- cant UFO Conference ever conducted in North America. Each representative should come prepared to forget past personality and group differences, or pet hypoth- eses, and devote their attention to fresh approaches that breed coopera- tion in UFOlogy.

The Fund for UFO Research, Inc. quarterly report, October-December 1981, not only updated their financial status, but included the successful ac- complishments during the period. The UFO Research Poll attached is an excellent method of determining which categories of research pro- grams should be stressed and where available funds should be used to maximize their efforts. The Mutual UFO Network as an organization has been unable to provide financial sup- port to the fund, however, many of our individual members have done so. MUFON will continue to lend support through publicity in the Jour- nal, as our contribution for the pres- ent. It would be appropriate at this time to restate MUFON's policy on adver- tising in the MUFON UFO Journal and the use of the Journal's mailing list by others. We do not accept paid advertisements, since many would have to be declined, creating embar- rassment for both the Journal staff and the advertiser. To some readers, publishing of advertisements implies an endorsement of the product. Even though a source of monetary income could be realized with purchased advertising, the poor relations created overshadow the benefits. The Journal staff and the Mutual UFO Network prefer to* treat items that might have been advertising as current news ar- ticles, thus we may be selective in editing-published material. Both APRO and NICAP have suf- fered embarrassment, requiring writ- ten apologies, when their subscribers mailing lists were sold to unscru- pulous people for advertising pur- poses. MUFON has never allowed our mailing list to be used by anyone for any purpose. As an example, when the Fund for UFO Research asked to use it, we declined on the\" basis of policy consistency. However, we offered to publish submitted material that would promote their fine work, which has been done through Journal Editor Richard H. Hall. Your director would like to thank all of the people who have con- tributed foreign postage stamps at the request of Richard Hall. The sale of these stamps to a collector is being used to pay for Air Mail postage of the Journal to some of our active leaders in the far corners of the world, which in turn stimulates information exchange internationally. 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE by Walt Andrus Many UFOlogists will be delighted to hear that Tom Benson will con- tinue as MUFON's State Director for New Jersey and remain active in the future.
