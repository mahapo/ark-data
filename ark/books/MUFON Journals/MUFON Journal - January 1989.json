FROM THE EDITOR We were not searching for a particular theme with which to inaugurate the Journal's 21st year of publication. But as it turned out one supplied itself, what with articles on the Big Sur photo- graphy case, MJ-12 and Leonard Stringfield's continuing collec- tion of crash-retrieval stories. That theme, of course, to paraph- rase past pundits in a different context, can be expressed as \"What did the President know, and when did he know it?\" How involved is the government with alleged UFO data? And who orchestrates the coverup, if there is one, anyway? Naturally, we don't guarantee any firm answers to those questions; but we do feel we supply the material that may eventually aid in making up your mind about the matter. What we do guarantee is a contin- ually improving UFO journal. In the meantime, we wish everyone the best for the New Year.

It is a first- hand account of an event. Before dealing with it and the subsequent revelations which have come from a variety of sources since 1964, con- sider this brief discussion about UFOs and The Press. It is a sad and curious fact that much of the literature surrounding the UFO phenomena appears in the highly sensationalized \"tabloids.\" Once relegated solely to pulp newsprint, this form of idiot-journalism has now moved into television with personali- ties like Geraldo Rivera, Morton Downey, Jr. and a growing number of other slime merchants. Owing to the prejudice toward this kind of journalism shared by intellectuals, academicians and the celebrities who frequently decry being victimized by the tabloids, such exposure has tended to desensitize the American Public to the 'potential seriousness of the UFO issue. Since tabloids seem to be writ- ten stylistically by and for the lunatic fringe, then UFOs are seen broadly as the purview of lunatics exclusively. If one wanted deliberately to deni- grate an issue, to relegate it to the trash heap of pop culture, one could not do so more completely than to insure that the issue falls into the hands of The Star or The National Enquirer or Geraldo Rivera! Perhaps a case could be made for the UFO evidence having been delivered over to garbage journalism by design as a method of discrediting it. MUTUAL UFO Journal, Number 249, January 1989 We know, for example, that at the beginning of his involvement with the subject, the late Dr. J. Allen Hynek, later Chairman of the Department of Astronomy at Northwestern Univer- sity, was employed by the United States Air Force with Project Blue Book to \"debunk\" all \"flying saucer\" sightings. His famous \"Swamp Gas\" conclusion has lived in the popular mythos long after the good Doctor's formal recantation of it. And, in spite of some of the general popularizing of the subject in films like Close Encount- ers of the Third Kind and E.T., Johnny Carson, David Letterman and other television talk show heroes, still get comic mileage out of poking fun at UFO investigators, \"swamp gas\" and the frequent loonies who claim to be incarnate space ships or to own condos on Venus.If the tabloids were not paid off to run as many mislead- ing, bizarre stories on UFOs and UFO Fringies as possible, always making these tales appear to be from or about some dimwit in the hinter- lands, then they may as well have been. Deliberate deception, Machiavellian conspiracy, coincidence or just the luck of the draw ... whatever the rea- son, the resultant tabloid \"sleaze fac- tor\" is a handicap for any scholar wishing to engage in research into what is, in fact, a fascinating and deli- ciously intricate field worthy of serious study. I am a scholar, a card-carrying Ph.D., and a university professor in a department of Journalism and Broad- casting. Some years ago I was an officer in the United States Air Force, the first officer in the photography career field, by the way, to be awarded the Air Force Guided Mis- sile Insignia; the \"Missile Badge.\" Those are facts. Another fact is that I have been a participant in an official United States Government- ordered UFO coverup. I've been rid- iculed by some of my colleagues in academia because in 1982 I wrote an article about this coverup and it appeared in The National Enquirer. It was not my intention to become a tabloid writer then or now. The Enquirer turned out to be the only publication I could find which was interested in printing the article at all. Both academic and mainstream jour- nals and periodicals turned it down cold over the period of nearly a year during which I submitted and resub- mitted it. I was told by editor after editor that UFO stories weren't \"pubish- able.\" I thought the story was impor- tant then. That's why I let a tabloid publish it. I still think it's important. That's why I responded to the invita- tion to write it for this journal. So much for preamble about the press. Big Sur Background Six years then, after it first broke, here is my report on what we photo- graphed at Big Sur along with some of what has happened since 1982 in plain, unheroic, non-sensational, unex- purgated and non-tabloidized English. I earned the \"Missile Badge\" for making a \"significant contribution to America's Missile and Space Pro- gram,\" so the citation read, while I was Officer-in-Charge of Photo-optical Instrumentation in the 1369th Photo- graphic Squadron at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California from May, 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"1963 to May, 1966. My work in estab- lishing a long range tracking site at Big Sur, California in large part is what convinced the Air Force to give me that cherished award. The cir- cumstances that took me to the \"Missile Badge\" ceremony as well as to that lovely and mysterious bulge of California coastline known as the Big Sur ended up changing my mind about a number of things, including the nature of our government, the nature of my personal belief systems and the nature of the universe. It began with a man named King- ston A. George. \"King\" George had the title of Operations Analyst for Headquarters, 1st Strategic Aerospace Division. The engineers, civilian and military, whose job it was to evaluate the instrumentation photography which we provided on every missile launch down the Western Test Range, were unhappy, he said. Shooting tracking footage from Vandenberg only pro- vided a look up the \"tailpipe\" of the missile. What George said they wanted was a side look at all stages of powered flight. This side-look was not possible from anyplace on the base. Because of the tortured California coastline, such a view was possible from one spot. Big Sur. Topographically, Big Sur is both north and west of Vandenberg. We reasoned that we might get the shot the engineers wanted if we could get high enough to provide both a line-of- sight to the base and to put us well above the offshore fog bank which blankets the California shoreline much of the year. Because of the 124 mile distance from Vandenberg to Big Sur, the final things needed were a lens with a very long focal length, a recording device capable of enhanc- ing the image and a tracking system on which to mount them. According to George, such a device was built and ready to go. It was the Boston University telescope, owned by the Air Force Eastern Test Range (AFETR) at Patrick Air Force Base, Florida and under the direction of Mr. Walter Manning in the Aerospace Sciences Division at AFETR. The optical segment of the device was a folded Gregorian telescope with a 24- inch diameter objective mirror and a 4 240-inch focal length. The lens appa- ratus was sealed from the air and insulated against heat and cold. A set of Barlow extenders could yield effec- tive focal lengths of from 480 to 2,400 inches. (The normal focal length lens for a 35mm camera is about two inches!) The light sensing element of the instru- ment was an image orthicon (televi- sion) tube. The I.O. could enhance the optical image, convert it to a ser- ies of electrical signals and display it on a Kinescope where it was photo- graphed with 35mm motion picture film. Because the I.O. had remarkably low noise, the gain could be \"cranked\" quite high to record very low light level objects. Such a device could record sources of light emission or reflection which were tens of times too weak for detection by other pho- tographic methods. The B.U., as it was called, was ideal for the purpose. One of the primary goals of our mission, accord- ing to George, was to provide infor- mation on the \"minute events follow- ing propellant depletion — at distances of from 300 to 800 nautical miles.\" (italics mine) If we could find a level place, accessible to the B.U. (not easy, con- sidering that the scope with its tracker was just a little smaller than a conventional moving van and had to be hauled by a heavy duty, cross- country type diesel truck) and see the missile through the haze well enough to lock in on it with the track- ing mount, we still had one problem left. Engineering sequential photography is of little use to the viewer without the addition of timing marks on the film. This time code received from Wheeling, West Virginia tagged each individual frame of film with a refer- ence point in real time to the moment of engine ignition and launch. The coded pips of light were recorded in the sound track area of the film by an exciter lamp driven by the signals from WWV. On the base, timing sig- nals were sent to the cameras by hardlines from the blockhouse. Run- ning a line to Big Sur with the neces- sary amplifiers would have been too costly, particularly for what was only a feasibility test. We had to try some- thing else. The solution was really very simple. On June 10, 1964 I lead a group of people to the aerie I had discovered earlier near Anderson Peak at an ele- vation of 3,400 feet on a Forest Ser- vice fire trail, 9 miles into the woods and uphill from Highway 1 in Big Sur. With me on that sunny summer day were my NCOIC, Chief Master Ser- geant Ike N. Davis, Jr., NCOIC of my Tracking Section, Staff Sergeant Jules Devine, Kingston A. George, with a / Technical Sergeant Porter from 1st STRATAD and a Mr. Paul- son from Patrick Air Force Base at Cape Kennedy. All of us agreed that the truck could certainly pull the B.U. up to this site with no trouble. Could we now get timing pips to it? We had with us that day a portable radio transceiver which we used at Vandenberg to communicate from my office to the mobile vehicles and our tracking sites on base. At Van- denberg I had Airman First Class Joseph Williams standing by. He had wired the output of one of the timing signals to an identical transceiver to the to the one I had. At my command he activated the radio and transmitted flawless timing signals to us at Big Sur, just as we had in a test weeks earlier. All that was necessary with the B.U. would be to patch-in our receiver to its timing signal input on the 35mm motion picture camera. Timing was no problem. There was happiness on the site and my \"Missile Badge\" was assured that day. On August 28, 1964, I lead a con- voy up the Pacific Coast Highway through Pismo Beach, past Hearst Castle at San Simeon and into what would be history. Technical Sergeant Thomas Dodd was my NCOIC for the remote site. He would operate our standard M-45 tracking mount with conventional 35mm Mitchell film cameras to compare with the results of the B.U. Telescope. AIC Joseph Williams was along to handle com- munications and timing. AIC Daryl Winters was also along. As a sad sideline. Winters would become the first and only Air Force photo man to be killed in action in Vietnam a little over two years later. Our Air Force troop camped at the preselected fire- MUTUAL UFO Journal.

Tele- scope arrived on site with its truck and its caravan of people for a 30-day test period. Walt Manning was with it along with a crew of three operators and one supervisor. We were also joined by two people from Vanden- berg: Chief Warrant Officer Guy M. Spooner from the Operations Section of the 1369th and Major Florenz J. Mansmann from 1st STRATAD. With a celebratory air, the B.U. was set in place and made ready to perform. Mansmann and Spooner went back to Vandenberg. The rest of us settled in to prepare for the first of what would be a total of 11 launches from the base during the 30 day test. Nine of these would be photographed through a major portion of powered Mutual UFO Journal, Number 249, January 1989 flight by both the B.U. Telescope operating with effective focal lengths ranging from 1200 inches to an aver- age of 720 inches, and with the con- ventional cameras and shorter lenses of the 1369th's M-45 mount. The Incident One of these launches would inspire an official government coverup and provoke an investigation and search for the filmed record which goes on to this day. Here is what happened. To the best of my recollection and based on sketchy records, the date of the event was most probably either September 2nd, 3rd, or 15th, 1964. The launch was of an Atlas missile. It was an Atlas-F as I recall strongly, but it may possibly have been an Atlas-D. The flight was in support of the Nike-Zeus objectives. Nike-Zeus was one of the United States' pro- jects to develop an anti-missile mis- sile. This particular mission was part of a test of an enemy radar-defeating system. The whole program in hind- sight seems very primitive, possibly futile and even a bit silly. Nearly a quarter of a century ago in 1964 it was deadly serious business. At the Big Sur tracking site we were ready to go as the countdown from Vandenberg progressed loud and clear on our radio. At the call of \"ignition ... liftoff\" all cameras rolled and scanned to the southeast for something to photograph. \"There it is!\", 1 shouted out as the Atlas leaped through the snow-white coastal fog blanket and both tracking mounts homed-in on the majestic \"bird\" in flight. The big Atlas could not have been more clean, clear and majestic. We were \"Go\" for the operation."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The magnification of the B.U. was truly impressive. The exhaust nozzles and lower third of the Atlas missile literally filled the frame at this dis- tance of over 100 nautical miles. With one tracking mount operator on azi- muth and one on elevation working completely manually, it was not easy to keep the image centered in the early stages of flight. As the nosecone package approached T + 400 seconds, sufficient angle of view had been established that we were literally locked down with the whole inflight package centered in the frame. No one on the site was watching the screen by this point. Our mission to provide the engineers with a side look at three stages of powered flight had been accomplished and we were a very happy bunch, congratulating each other and letting the film run out in the 35mm motion picture camera focused on the Kinescope. I took the cans of exposed film and headed down the coast to Vanden- berg and our laboratory. Processing of the film would occur that night and the results would be ready for view- ing the next day. Men in Grey I was back at my desk enjoying the feeling of accomplishment from the Big Sur expedition when I was called by Major Mansmann, who asked me to come right away to his office at the Headquarters building. When I arrived, I found a movie projector set up in the office and a group of people waiting. Among these I recall two men in plain grey suits who spoke lit- tle and watched me intently as the lights were dimmed and the film played on a bright screen. (Mans- mann has since stated that there were actually three men present.) It was a surprise and a delight for me to be seeing the kinescope record- ing from Big Sur after all the months of planning and weeks of work. I was quite amazed and very pleased with the quality, especially at the distance involved as we could make out quite plainly the separated nosecone, the radar experiment and the dummy warhead all sailing along beautifully about 60 miles straight up from planet Earth and some 300 to 500 nautical miles down range. As we neared the end of the camera run, Mansmann said, \"Watch carefully now, Lieuten- ant Jacobs.\" At that point the most remarkable vision of my life came on the screen. Another object flew into the frame from left to right. It approached the warhead package and - maneuvered around it. That is, this ... \"thing\" ... flew a relative polar orbit around our warhead package which was itself heading toward the South Pacific at some 18 thousand miles an hour! As the new object circumnavigated our hardware, it emitted four distinct, bright flashes of light at approxi- mately the 4 cardinal compass points of its orbit. These flashes were so intense that each \"strike\" caused the I.O. tube to \"bloom\" or form a halo around the spot. Following this remark- able aerial display, the object departed the frame in the same direction from which it had come. The shape of the object was that of a classic \"flying saucer.\" In the middle of the top half of the object was a dome. From that dome, or just beneath it, seemed to issue a beam of light which caused the flashes described. Subsequently the warhead malfunc- tioned and tumbled out of suborbit hundreds of miles short of its target. This ... unidentified flying ... \"thing\" ... had apparently \"shot down\" an Amer- ican dummy atomic warhead! The lights came on and Major Mansmann said, \"Lieutenant Jacobs, were you or any of your people fool- ing around up there at Big Sur?\" \"No sir,\" I answered honestly. I was shaking with excitement. \"Then tell me ... what the Hell was that?\" I looked Major Mansmann straight in the eye. \"It looks to me like we got a UFO,\" I said. There was a stifling silence among the men in grey, civilian suits who continued to stare at me. Major Mansmann gave them what I can only describe as a \"let me handle this\" look. Cover-Up \"Well,\" he smiled cordially, \"let's just say it never happened. You are to say nothing about this footage to anyone. As far as you and I are con- cerned, 'this never took place, you understand?\" I looked at the men in the grey suits. They were not smiling. I felt hot and anxious. I was sweating badly. I think I just sat for a minute looking blankly at Major Mansmann. I had just seen the most fantastic event of my life. It etched a path in my memory as deep as the one put there almost a year earlier when President John F. Kennedy had been shot to death in Dallas. I wanted more than anything to see it again, to study it under a magnifier, to analyze the pic- tures frame by frame. Major Mansmann did smile, nicely. \"I don't need to remind you of the seriousness of a security breach, do I Lieutenant?\", he asked. \"No, sir,\" I replied. \"Good,\" he said, motioning for me to stand. I stood. He walked me to the door, speak- ing confidentially. \"What you just saw did not take place,\" he repeated. \"It never happened.\" I looked at him once more. Some- thing flickered way back deep in his eyes as he again looked at the men in grey then back to me. \"But ... if at some time in the future,\" Florenz Mansmann said finally, \"you are pressed by someone about this and you can't get out of answer- ing, just tell them ... tell them it was flashes from laser tracking, O.K.?\" And with that, I was ushered out the door and into over a decade of silence on the subject. Never mind that in 1964 we did not have laser tracking, nor did we or any other power on Earth have spacecraft cap- able of flying circles around a subor- bital capsule. I tried to sublimate the whole incident out of loyalty and respect for Florenz Mansmann whom I liked a great deal. While I did not talk about the event with anyone. I did begin a period of intense research into the UFO phenomena. My research interest in the field continues to the present. Of particu- lar fascination is the relationship of the press to the UFO. This great. Mutual UFO Journal. Number 249. January 19S9"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Liberal bastion of free enquiry, this body of muckrakers which prides itself so highly on prodding and upsetting political figures, has played very prettily into the hands of those same government minions who wish to obfuscate the whole field of dis- covery, discussion and debate about the most perplexing and possibly most important scientific conundrum in the history of our species. While chasing after Pulitzer Prizes for such relatively petty mischief as political dirty tricks at Watergate, or poor old Gary Hart and his happy harlots or the hapless Dan Quayle and his colorless, but merely mediocre back- ground, The Press has persistently missed one of the really imperative stories of our time. Goes Public I told my small portion of it first, tentatively, on a late night talk show which I hosted in Eureka, California in 1973 on station KFMI-FM. The response I got to my revelation was almost as astonishing as had been the event itself. My program director, Richard Van Pelt, came forth to tell his own tale of a CE3K which hap- pened to him while he was an Air Force Security NCO in Iceland 20 years earlier. A university physics professor at California State Univer- sity, Humboldt who had worked on the H-bomb project came forth to tell about his firm belief in the extrater- restrial nature of UFOs. Since then I have met a number of other people whom I respect, whom I know not to be \"fringies\" or cranks or crackpots, but who share common experiences with UFO sightings and encounters. And, finally, in 1982, I decided that my story needed to be aired to a broader audience. Eighteen years had gone by. I could not get it out of my mind after all that time. Then, first in the trade journals, later in the popu- lar press, there were hints of a new weapon system in the offing. It was some kind of satellite-smasher we were told. Soon we would hear Pres- ident Reagan himself disrobe the rumors and give us Star Wars (SDI). There were the rumors of aircraft being built which were invisible to Mutual UFO Journal, Number 249, January 1989 radar (some said to the human eye, as well!) \"Stealth,\" they were called. It is significant to recall that until very recently, the Air Force denied that they existed, too! There were persist- ent stories of something called Pro- ject Snowbird where American pilots were being shown how to operate captured (or donated) alien space- craft. Something about the Big Sur film seemed to be part of the overall pattern. I held back writing my story because of the Security angle until the truth occurred to me. There was no \"security breach\" in this story. The damn thing had never been \"Classified SECRET\" or anything else. I had been told simply that it \"NEVER HAPPENED\"! Therefore, I was free to tell the story to whomever I pleased since it was about a non- event officially. I wrote my article. I shopped it around. In the end The National Enquirer published it. And as now retired Major Florenz J. Mansmann put it, \"Jacobs opened Pandora's Box.\" I was contacted by a variety of investigators, buffs, cranks, propo- nents and detractors alike. James Oberg, a frequent \"mouthpiece\" for certain NASA projects and self-styled UFO Debunker wrote to disparage my story and to ask provocatively, \"Since you obviously feel free to dis- cuss top secret UFO data, what would you be willing to say about other top secret aspects of the Atlas warhead which you alluded to briefly ...?\" I told Mr. Oberg where to put his misplaced cynicism. Mansmann, now a Ph.D. research consultant at Stanford and a farmer near Fresno, California was besieged with requests for information, and for his version of what happened. My respect and admiration for him was vindicated as he categorically verified my account. Conclusions Academicians first gather data, then postulate conclusions based on what they find. From what I have gathered first hand, (primary evidence), pieced together from Mansmann, from a fine researcher named Lee M. Graham, from contemplation, discussion and debate of the material, as well as from the Air Force position on this and other related matters, I have come to the following conclusions: (1) What we photographed that September day in 1964 was a solid, three-dimensional, intelligently controlled flying device. (2) It emitted a beam of energy, possibly a plasma beam, at our dummy warhead and caused a malfunc- tion. (3) This \"craft\" was not anything of which our science and technology -in 1964 was capable. The most probable explanation of the device, therefore, is that it was of extraterrestrial origin. (4) The flashing strikes of light we recorded on film were not from laser tracking devices. Such devices did not exist then aside from small scale, laboratory models. (5) Most probably the B.U. Tele- scope was brought out to California specifically to photograph this event which had been prearranged. That is, we had been setup to record an event which someone in our Govern- ment knew was going to happen in - advance. (6) What we photographed that day was the first terrestrial demon- stration of what has come to be called S.D.I, or \"Star Wars.\" The demonstration was put oh for our benefit for some reason by extrater- restrials. It is this aspect of the event, not merely the recording of another \"flying saucer\" which caused such consternation both on the part of Major Mansmann when he told me \"it never happened,\" and on behalf of the government in its two and one- half decade coverup of the event and the record we made of it. It is this defense-oriented aspect of the case which has caused investiga- tors to run into stone walls in trying to track down my story. The Air Force has alternately denied that I was ever an officer, that I was ever stationed at Vandenberg, that I was OIC of Photo-optical Instrumentation in the 1369th Photographic Squadron, that there was a tracking site at or near Big Sur, California, that an Atlas-F, or for that matter, any other missile was launched on or about the"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"date or dates I reported. Documentation We have been able to verify through FOIA requests and my military records everything except the specific launch and the fact of its having been filmed. We have been told first that there were no launches, then that there were launches but no malfunctions. Herewith, for the first time I present the documentation for a mission mal- function in an official unclassified Air Force document which has finally surfaced in my collection of aging papers and books. It was prepared by Kingston A. George, dated 13 Oct. 1964 and is entitled, OPERATIONS ANALYSIS STAFF STUDY PRELIMINARY REPORT ON IMAGE ORTHICON PHOTOGRAPHY FROM BIG SUR In this document, \"King\" George gives us a quick sketch of the whole Big Sur project, tells us that \"Over the period of 30 days, from 31 August to 30 September, during which the Boston University telescope was ready to film launches, eleven flights were made from Vandenberg,\" that \"a final report will be forthcoming in a few weeks with a complete description of the system and the operations over the past several weeks,\" that \"a doc- umentary film of about 30 minutes length containing several minutes of selected film clips will be assembled\" and that one powered-flight anomaly was observed (italics mine), and the coverage of the flights has produced enough data to show that Big Sur photography could be an important adjunct to other instrumentation.\" It is not clear whether or not King- ston George was privy to the screen- ings of the Big Sur film which recorded the UFO. My suspicion is that he was one of those to whom Mansmann has admitted showing the film. His document, however, states clearly that a missile malfunctioned during the B.U. test period, now put- ting the final lie to the Air Force denials. That is my story. It is from my own experiences, recollections, records, and hands. You are free to interpret it as you like. As a footnote I need to comment, I suppose, on the coverup. I do not believe that anyone is going to succeed in getting the film on an F.O.I.A. request. I have been asked to make such a request myself and refuse to do so. Eric Mishara, Lee Graham, T. Scott Grain, Jr. and oth- ers have done so and have run into the wall of futility. I don't believe that anyone can succeed in getting the film because the fact of its existence will have been completely expunged from the records by now. Investigators who encounter nega- tive replies from the Air Force, from representatives who are at Vanden- berg now are not necessarily being deceived deliberately. Nearly 25 years have passed and no one presently at the base has any personal recollec- tion of the event, much less any offi- cial record of it. Consider the very limited number of people who saw the film in the first place and you will comprehend how simple it was to make it disappear. Finally, if the government did offi- cially \"classify\" the film either back then or subsequently, then perhaps there were/are compelling reasons for it to have done so. As the B-2 \"Stealth\" Bomber has now been unveiled publicly at last, we can con- template the rationale for having kept it \"classified\" for so long. At some point, when no harm can come from the information, perhaps the film for which I was responsible that long ago September day in the cool, clear mountains of Big Sur will be made public, along with the possibly awe- some technological power which the images recorded on it represented. One significant fact remains. The experimental tracking site which I installed near Anderson Peak became a permanent location for missile tracking on the Western Test Range. Moved nearer the peak geographically and magnitudes better technically, it is there today. You see footage from it every time a Space Shuttle reenters for a landing at Edwards Air Force Base. What else it records or has recorded and its ultimate purpose for being there is a matter for history, hopefully, to reveal.

Moore and my work, and in direct response to a vicious guilt-by-innuendo article on the MJ-12 matter which I am reli- ably informed is currently being pre- pared by CSICOP spokesman Ken- drick Frazier in close concert with Phil Klass, it seems appropriate to make some sort of statement which will clear the air. First of all, let me begin by stating for the record that I am not a \"forger,\" a \"hoaxer,\" a \"fabricator\" or a \"counterfeiter\"; nor, to the best of my knowledge, have I ever partici- pated in any illegal or un-American activity in connection with my more than eight-year involvement with the MJ-12 controversy. Furthermore, to the best of my knowledge and belief, none of my colleagues and associates has participated in any such activities either. Rumors circulating to the effect that I am some sort of government Mutual UFO Journal. Number 249. January 19S9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"agent or \"disinformation\" expert are totally false. In spite of pronounce- ments made principally by John Lear and others associated with him, I am not on the U.S. Government's (or any other government's) payroll.

MJ-12 Whether the MJ-12 and associated documents are authentic, and indeed, whether the entire MJ-12 story has any truth to it at all remains an entirely open question. I and my col- leagues have conducted our investi- gation into this matter in our own way and essentially outside of the UFO-community at large. The infor- mation which we have made available concerning this process has been entirely in keeping with our own methods and objectives. What has been withheld has been withheld for good reason. It is no secret that many of you who read this letter have voiced strong objections to the way things have been done. Some, having raised valid questions which remain unans- wered, have wrongly assumed that there are no answers and have seen fit to vent their frustrations by point- ing an accusing finger. Others, per- haps seeing the controversy surrounding MJ-12 as some sort of threat to their own stature as self-styled \"UFO ex- perts,\" or \"skeptics,\" have chosen the convienence of dismissing the entire matter out-of-hand rather than the prudence of withholding judge- ment until all of the facts are in. To individuals in both of these rush-to-judgement groups, my advice is simply be calm and be patient. We have every intention of getting to the bottom of this matter, and we have every intention of making a full and complete disclosure once this process is complete. Until that time, I and my colleagues are going to continue to follow our own counsel and to do things in our own way — preferably with the support of the UFO com- munity, but if necessary without it. Once the entire story comes out, it is our firm conviction that all of the Mutual UFO Journal, Number 249, January 1989 dark spots in this very strange pic- ture puzzle will become clear and we will all have answers to many of the questions which now exist about the true nature of our government's involvement with the UFO pheno- menon. SOURCES Meanwhile, it seems completely inappropriate at this time for members of the UFO community and skeptics alike to continue to assail my methods or to cast aspersions upon my integ- rity and honesty through grape-vine gossip and the typically half-baked, poorly researched journalism of the Skeptical Inquirer. Equally inapprop- riate is the continuing high level of sheer speculation concerning the true identities of the two sources who appeared on the \"UFO,Cover-Up? ... Live!\" show under the code names \"Falcon\" and \"Condor.\" In the eight weeks since the airing of this show, the controversy has grown to such outrageous proportions that, to date, \"Falcon\" has been \"reliably identified\" as no less than three different people and \"Condor\" as five! For obvious reasons, my position continues to be one of \"no comment\" with respect to who ANY of my sources might be. Indeed, the identity of any or all of the TEN \"inside\" contacts I and my colleagues have developed is ulti- mately of FAR LESS IMPORTANCE than the fact that, to date, FOUR of them have agreed to tell their story before members of Congress! As of this writing, committments are cur- rently being sought from the others, and negotiations are under way with two members of Congress who have expressed an interest in the matter. If we are succesful in these efforts, then the entire matter of the credibility of sources and the authenticity of doc- uments will have been placed in a forum entirely out of our hands, and the question of Bill Moore's, or Jaime Shandera's, or Stan Friedman's motives, methods and credibility will no longer be an issue. It is toward such an end that we actively seek the unity and support of the entire UFO community. At the Washington, D.C. MUFON UFO Symposium in June of 1987, when we first brought the essence of this matter to the attention of the UFO community and the public, I asked for assistance and support from anyone interested in helping us get to the bot- tom of it. Some of you joined that effort — most did not. Many of you remained properly skeptical, and in so doing put the lie to oft repeated charges of a few hard-line UFO-bashers that most UFOlogists are much too gul- lible or credulous for their own good. Others, who disagreed with our way of doing things and apparently saw us as some sort of threat to the well-being of UFOlogy in general and themselves in particular, saw fit to throw as many rocks in our direction as they possibly could. It is now time to put those emotions aside and pull together in an effort to bring this matter to a conclusion. As Jerry Clark noted in an International UFO Reporter editorial over a year ago, the MJ-12 affair, unlike most other aspects of UFOlogy, is one where it is possible to obtain answers — one way or the other. If this information is real and the sources providing it are bona fide, then we have a major story on our hands. If, on the other hand, it turns out to be some sort of eight-year-long, elaborate disinformation scheme, or even an outright hoax, then we have an equally important story of another type. In either case, the truth will ultimately be made known and, once that happens, UFOlogy will go on. Petty bickering and emotional tirades have no place in this search for truth, and they are unbecoming to a field of study which is well on its way to becoming a recog- nized area of scientific and journalistic endeavor. We have every intention of seeing our work through to its conclu- sion. What your role will be in that process is entirely up to you. This letter, then, is intended as an olive branch from me and my asso- ciates to you — UFOlogist, skeptic and UFO-basher alike. Our goal, like yours, is to ultimately get to the bottom of this very important matter. It is our belief that progress towards this end will be better served by a united effort than by continued animosity. If you agree, please let me hear from you in the near future.

Stringfield Prologue At this writing, many issues of con- troversey hang over UFO research. Some have caused bitter differences between team members; some can backfire and smear the image of objective research itself. In the middle zone, trying to avoid the \"people\" problems, I feel the urgent need to continue my probes into one basic issue — UFO crash/retrievals. In this endeavor, once we can see through the spectre of disinformation and find convincing evidence — or proof — that UFOs are nut-and-bolt vehicles with an alien crew aboard, I believe that serious researchers can then go forward to disregard all the other wispy issues and maybe even put a stop to the disruptive noises coming out of the woodwork from the far-out fringe. Ideally, with the media supporting the demands for \"bottom line\" facts from a strong phalanx of the scientific community, and perhaps some politi- cians, the UFO coverup lid might melt or at least change, allowing for some admissions and disclosures. Confirming any one case of an alleged UFO crash and recovery — Roswell, Aztec, Kingman, El Yunque or even Brown County, Ohio — could, in itself, alarm the world public or even demolish some of its cher- ished traditions and philosophies. It could also lead to an eventual sharing of alien technologies — a new pro- pulsion system for inner and outer space travel or new \"metals\" and many other marvels — and certainly it would bring public support for NASA, and a bigger budget for vital space probes. More importantly, we might learn about the alien entities themselves; their intent for being here and an explanation for some of their 10 incursive actions — to name one, abductions! Even at this short-of-proof stage, the UFO crash/retrieval story, still unfolding, I believe, should be public information — unless it, and the full UFO story, is too exotically grim to tell. In that case I reserve judgment. Feeling confident, I submit new data, based on my research and the cooperative work of others, for open review. Part I: The Quiet of Dusk ... As we close out the decade of the 80's, new public interest in UFOs, it seems, is surging. Some of it proba- bly is the trickledown from new books on the market, but for the most part, new and old researchers alike, are being spurred by recent revelations of official coverup amid some sobering reports of human encounters of the first, second, and third kind. Perhaps already an established fact is the climactic close encounter of the fourth kind: contact with an alien race. Based on rumors, contending that a covert human-alien relationship has been in effect, and of late, more rumors that tell of a ruptured \"alliance,\" we must not only pause and wonder about the magnitude of a colossal coverup but the implications of an eventual open contact — even if it were on terms of peaceful co-existence. Any other alternative staggers the imagination! But, getting down to Earth, as we once knew it, we must also pause and ask in all seriousness, where's the proof that a spacecraft exists or, for that matter, a coverup? A seemingly stupid question when we hear so many lurid tales about abductions, alien underground instal- lations, genetic manipulation, animal and human mutilations, of American and Russian satellites exploding in space, of alien artifacts on the Moon and Mars, of dire predictions of the world's end and, yes, to a lesser degree, UFO crash/retrievals. Once a blockbuster to research in the late 70's and early 80's, a crash story in 1988 is no longer big ufological news. As I weigh all the reports, or rumors, mindful of mis/disinforma- tion, I still maintain that it is in C/R research that we may find our elusive proof. Once the hardware and the crews, cadaverous or alive, are forced into public view, then we may find credibility for some of the other pos- tulates and be in a better position to espouse endless hypotheses. Since presenting my paper, The Fatal Encount- er at Ft. Dix-McGuire: A Case Study at the Mutual UFO Network Sympo- sium, St. Louis, 1985, and pursuing some leads in that case to little con- sequence, I have remained relatively quiet on the literary front. New C/R reports, from time to time, have sur- faced since 1985, but most were secondhand or of the \"Cheshire Cat\" variety, providing scant information. What I had, with a few exceptions were not up to Roswell caliber and these could wait until ... August and September of 1988. Then, in the quiet of dusk, my research suddenly hit a peak. As Dick Hall, the author of Uninvited Guests, Auro- ra Press, 1988, commented, the \"ther- mostat\" (by official orchestrators) seems to be turned up. During this time, ten new sources emerged, each promising that useful information about UFO crash/retrievals would soon fol- low. By the end of November most promises were filled, some were first- hand, some second. But, more impor- tantly, some provided new backup information for cases cited in my pre- Mutual UFO Journal. Number J49. January"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"viously published status reports. Most rewarding was the timely emergence of persons serving in covert positions with substantive information in key areas of my work. Reflecting back, I see in them parallels to the medical sources in 1978 who surfaced and shared graphic descriptive anatomical details of the alien body for release in Status Report II, The UFO Crash/- Retrieval Syndrome. As a matter of record, this prototype information remains to this day analogous to most reports of alien encounters and is much like the computerized rendi- tion shown in October 1988, on the TV documentary, The UFO Coverup. Tabloids Proof? Of course not. Getting close to it? Perhaps. And, yes, I'm aware of the adroit arts of disinformation. While I see no evidence of devious game-playing in my current input, nor in some of the material received in the later 70's and early 80's, I am aware of another recent suspect annoyance where my name was in blatant public view by a tabloid, the Weekly World News. In its Sep- tember 20, 1988 issue I was headlined as an \"expert\" having the inside scoop on an alleged alien under- ground facility in Dulce, New Mexico. Bunkum! Fact is, I have no such scoopy news but, I have heard the rumors about Dulce and the one in Nevada and others. Triggering the tabloid article was a story published in a county weekly newspaper that had covered my talk on UFO crashes at the Milford Public Library, near Cincinnati, in April 1988. The Weekly World News, how- ever, in picking up the story and my brief reference to Dulce, ignored my statement that such reports could be mis/disinformation. Was I being set up, as some researchers wondered, as a target for ridicule? In this case, for the record, I doubt it, knowing the unscrupulous behavior of the tabloids. Alert to the risk of tabloid exploita- tion and official machinations that try to maintain secrecy, one treating a sensitive subject like C/R must also expect the unexpected from even Mutual UFO Journal, Number 249, January 1989 \"friendly\" quarters. And most often, unexpectedly, from out of the rank- and-file of research, comes the sud- den strike of a cobra or a \"loop\" of such snakes-in-the-grass who try to take one's work and credibility to task and make a big stinking mess of it. Reasons may be many. Is it simply arrogance and a thirst for fame or power, or is it the work of the orchestrators, who pick and choose their lackeys? Whatever the reasons I have felt their sting since I presented my first paper, Retrievals of the Third Kind, at the MUFON Symposium in Dayton, 1978. While most of these early adversaries have faded away, lit- tle loops persist who employ subtler ways to undermine my work. Haunting me still, is a remark by a loop kingpin averring that all my case histories, published in my series of status reports, were \"fairy tales,\" thus of no substance. Drawn into his loop is a pundit, a prominent writer in UFO media, who, having belittled my work since 1978, has worked well into the scheme. In later years, through his editorial controls, whe- never C/R was an issue, my work was simply snubbed. More recently, still another in the loop told a mutual correspondent that my investigations have no depth and that I'm a good subject for disinformation. Obviously, sad to say, these loop- ers have not done much \"investiga- tion in depth\" about my modus oper- andi, or have not taken into considera- tion the lack of funds at my disposal to follow up hundreds of leads, coast- to-coast. Also, it is beyond my com- prehension how some of my contem- poraries can entertain the notion that I have gullibly accepted as valid, or bona fide, every item of C/R material published in my papers. Once again, for the record, the purpose of my status reports is to draw in new sources with new information that could either strengthen a case or give reason to drop it in the circular file. True, that some of the best made plans go awry, and true, that some entries in my monographs have obvious weaknesses and some, based on new information, have become questiona- ble. An example is Case A-2, Status Report III. However, the mainstream material from early sources remains solid and one, I thought, that deserved a full investigation was the Ft. Dix- McGuire case which has become stronger from new information from new sources. Someday, perhaps, for the record, I may write a special paper updating the status quo of my published case histories. While the mid to late 80's did not produce any substantial Crash/Re- trieval case histories worthy of a monograph, except the Ft. Dix-McGuire affair, it was not devoid of highpoints. CASE I) While attending the MU- FON Symposium in St. Louis, 1985, Raymond Jordan, a MUFON investi- gator, gave me a confidential lead to follow up involving a lady who had worked at the Pentagon in 1952, who, he said, had seen an alien body \"pickled\" in a glass tank in an \"Off Limits\" room. By mistake, she had entered the room, was promptly nabbed and forced to sign papers swearing her to secrecy. When I reached the lady, who was still employed by a government office, she said, \"I know what you're talking about,\" then added, \"but I can't talk.\" I suggested she communicate by other means to which she replied, \"No. I don't want to talk about it at all.\" CASE 2) Thanks to Michael Johns- tone, a California researcher, who did some good research spadework, it was arranged for me to talk with a former marine who claimed, in 1963, he stood guard at an undisclosed mil- itary base which housed a \"disc- shaped vehicle with ovoid cross sec- tion, 40 ft. across and 13 ft. thick at the center.\" A more detailed descrip- tion of the craft appeared in my arti- cle, The Chase for Proof in a Squir- rel's Cage, published in the British book, UFO's, 1947-1987. The marine, who signed a security oath, said that he guarded the secret premises for two weeks while a technical crew, speaking in code, tried every known means to gain entry into the craft, including a laser device. Once, he said he observed that it deflected off the curved side of the craft into the rafters causing some damage. \"The public should know the truth about UFOs,\" the ex-marine told me, but I 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Something unidentified crashed into a heavily wooded mountain in the township of St. Geniez, France, March 18, 1972. According to witnesses it caused brush fires over a forty acre area. felt he knew more than he had cau- tiously related, and would not budge in disclosing the name of the base. CASE 3) Former military sources with information about witnessing a special movie showing deceased alien bodies surfaced in the late 70's. These were published in my Status Report II (See Cases A-4 and A-9). The viewing of the film was always behind doors and the viewers were few. Then in 1985, Chris Coffey, of Cincinnati, who was a close friend of astronaut Ellison Onizuka, revealed to me that she had asked him when they met after one of his visits to Wright-Patterson AFB, about his in- terest in UFOs. He admitted he kept an open mind on the subject and added that his curiosity was aroused when he and a select group of Air Force pilots, at McClelland AFB in 1973 were shown a black-and-white movie film featuring \"alien bodies on a slab.\" In his state of shock, he said he remembered saying aloud, \"Oh, my God!\" Chris, knowing my work in C/R, had arranged for me to meet Onizuka to discuss UFOs after his scheduled flight on the space shuttle Challenger. As it turned out, fate intervened when the shuttle exploded. Texas-Mexico CASE 4) With the confusion among researchers over the number, loca- tions and dates for several alleged UFO crashes on the Texas border with Mexico — and in Mexico — Tom Deuley, who heads the MUFON team in Texas, wrote to me in Feb- ruary, 1988, excerpts, as follows: \"Shortly after returning from Wash- ington (MUFON Symposium) my group was challenged to look into the El Indio-Guerrero case that is briefly mentioned in the MJ-12 document ... I'm writing to ask if you can give us any details, or rumors, beyond what is printed in your papers ... I have 12 gone through your works and made copies of everything that may be related to the El Indio case.\" My response by letter, February 12, 1988, follows: \"... A few weeks ago, I was sorting out some old cor- respondence and found a letter dated March 1985 on which I had noted, Follow Up. I noted also that I had tried to reach the sender, seeking more information, but got no reply. So, I tried again in January of this year. Fortunately, this time, I was able to reach the son-in-law of the source. Cooperatively, he gave me his phone number, Mr. JA, in Cali- fornia. Having a friendly chat with JA, I find no reason to question his sincerity. He was no UFO buff, hav- ing no knowledge of current affairs. \"... According to JA, he was aboard the USS McKinley, cargo class, the command ship for smphib- ious operations, docket at San Diego. Many admirals aboard. His job: mes- senger. The time, he said, was late 1948 or early 1949. It was winter and he remembers a quick cruise to Alaska in between those years. \"JA was on deck when he learned from the top brass that a small task force was assembled and ordered to go to a certain location (unknown to him) into Mexico to retrieve a crashed flying saucer. They departed by vehi- cle, but he was not certain if they drove to the site or used other means to reach what was described as a remote region of Mexican desert. The task force was gone for several days and when they returned, he said everything was hushed up. He did, however, hear one of the officers on the mission say that they got some dead bodies and some managed to get away. They were able to move at great speed,\" he recalls the officer saying. JA never heard more about the saucer or the bodies, but he did remember reading a brief item in a San Diego newspaper about the crash in Mexico.\" CASE 5) Something unidentified crashed into a heavily wooded moun- tain in the township of St. Geniez, France, March 18, 1972. According to witnesses it caused brush fires over a forty acre area. Significant was that the incident occurred during a flap of UFO reports in that southeastern part of France. The story was originally obtained by researcher Olivier Rieffel, in 1986, during a meeting with Leon Visse, the person identified in Dr. Jean Gille's papers published in Status Report III (see Case B-8). With Visse's disclo- sure that the crash occurred near the Durance River, Rieffel informed his colleague, Jean Sider, who found in his records that the time and place coincided with a reported crash of a \"space object\" into a mountain near the town of Sisteron in St. Geniez, through which the river Durance passes. According to most witnesses, the UFO was described as a \"red ball\" of fire and one informed source, who prefers anonymity, stated it was \"red-orange, shaped like a disc.\" While the investigations continue, through the well-coordinated team- work of Sider and Rieffel, extensive records of their findings were sent to me for appraisal in April 1988. Included was a fragment from the site of a ceramic-like substance apparently baked by intense heat; three pages of first- hand reports from witnesses who saw the descending red object, among them farmers in the region, the son of the mayor, a newspaper reporter on the scene and members of the police and fire departments. Of note, was an astronomer whose investiga- tions ruled out a meteorite and other meteorological and atmospheric pheno- mena. Said Sider, \"The facts of the case remain classified in the files of the military and the Nationale Gen- darmerie Archives,\" adding, \"Con- firming all the main details was a member of an intelligence agency who stated that 'something' was received by the Gendarmerie and shipped in a truck to a location near Paris.\" Sider emphasized that his report was not conclusive and investigations were still in progress.

Humanoid Remains CASE 6) Far more spectacular, but affording far less supportive evi- dence than the St. Geniez incident, is the firsthand report from a retired medical doctor who alleges he accid- entally found the skeletal remains of two humanoids, possibly of alien origin, on his farm in western Ken- tucky in March 1987. When informed of the story, I was eventually able to reach the doctor through his friend, Bill Boshears, who first aired it on his radio talk show in Cincinnati. Since the show, having been warned to \"shut up\" in no uncertain terms, the doctor, nonethe- less, entrusted me with his name, but would not reveal the location of his farm nor give me, or anyone else, his unlisted phone number. He also advised that some of the details he shared with me about the investigation by the Air Force should be kept confiden- tial. The doctor, when he talked with me on his friend's phone, was cordial, but brief. He said that it was during a routine evening stroll on his farm property of 400 acres that he disco- vered the extraordinary evidence. Next to a burned-out circle, about 4 ft. in diameter, in an open grassy field, he found the skeletons of two humanoid entities about 4 ft. apart. Without a trace of clothing, some of the bones, he said, showed residual ligament, with evidence that preda- tors had been at work. As a doctor, he was certain that the bones were not of animal origin and on closer examination, -he was shocked, he said, to find that the structure was bipedal, about 4 ft. tall, with a large skull and cat-like jaw, a barrel-like rib cage with long arms and three fin- gers. For sure, they were not human. The doctor's next move was to call the sheriff, who, without hesitation, called the Air Force. The next morning at sunrise, said the doctor, he was surprised to see three helicopters land in a clearing and many people, some in uniform, Mutual UFO Journal, Number 249, January 1989 As a doctor, he was certain that the bones were not of animal origin. The structure was bipedal, about 4 ft. tall, with a large skull and cat-like jaw, a barrel-like rib cage with long arms and three fingers. some not, being deployed over a wide area. Greeting him was a Colonel (name known to me) who cordially introduced himself and stated his mission: remove the bones and under- soil, test and remove the burned cir- cular soil and comb the area for any other evidence. Later in the day, fresh soil was filled in the excavated areas, and the doctor was told that the soil in the circle had been baked at 3,000 degrees. When asked about the time factor of body decomposition (allowing for predators) he estimated, according to cursory examination, that the aliens had been exposed for less than a hundred days. Reminding me that \"they put the fear of God in me\" after his trip to a military base for further interrogation and where he was shown photos of other alien corpses, he expressed interest in my research and I sug- gested that we lunch together soon. He agreed, but never called. Brown County CASE 7) News of a UFO crash on a farm in Brown County (Southw- estern Ohio) in the Spring of 1987, looked promising at the outset and as I tried to put the pieces of raw infor- mation into some order to make the next move, mainly to reach the prin- ciple source, I ran into every con- ceivable roadblock. A year after \"giv- ing up,\" information surfaced from a new source to give credence that something did crash at the farm site. Whatever happened, I could now see through some of the screwiest diver- sions that blocked me from contact- ing the farmer who claimed he saw the crashed disc, three small female non-human bodies strewn in the field and, above all else, had some unusual metallic fragments from the debris to prove it. My initial informant was JD, a gemologist and a persevering UFO buff, who, in getting many packages by United Parcel Service, learned from the driver on her rural route that the farmer \"down the road\" had pieces of metal from a UFO that crashed on his property. When JD tried to learn the farmer's name and location, the driver got scared, and I was later told to avoid the issue, even changed his route. Undaunted, JD then opted to go to the local police office near the site, hoping to locate the farmer. There, she got the runa- round and was advised by one officer to forget the matter. But, according to JD, the officer with the friendly advice, later visited her home and for some unexplained reason gave her a photo of the farm property. At this point, JD suddenly showed signs of confusion and fear, claiming that her house had been entered, that the photograph of the property had been taken which she had used as a bookmark in a library book (by Major Keyhoe) and that the book was found on the hood of her car in the garage. Next came word that she had been injured in a fall into a sewer hole between her house and garage. The lid had been loosened, she said. Investigating, my son-in-law and I could find nothing else abnormal in her manner of keeping house but, indeed, we began to wonder about her going off the deep-end and if she had become obsessed to a degree of fantasy. Or, was it all a hoax, or a ploy of disinformation? Time went by without further con- tact. But I felt that something was strange, something amiss about the case. Concerned, I got in touch with a former Air Force intelligence officer who had the \"right\" connections, and asked if he could help throw light on the affair. Two days later, he called back to relate that he had been in 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"touch with the \"right\" person and was told that there had been \"no sig- nificant UFO sightings in that area for the past year.\" He added that my informant would soon be visited by two investigators in an official capacity. Several weeks later, I got a sur- prise call from JD who said simply, \"I'm not supposed to talk with you, but here I am.\" She went on to explain that she had two visitors who, in learning she had no hidden metal artifacts, debunked the crash and also my work in crash/retrieval research, and advised in so many words, that she should not contact me in the future. Not long after that, JD called me again, admitting that she had met the farmer, had visited the farm, saw the newly added soil over the crash site, and moreover, gave me the farmer's name, and had made plans for him to visit me the following week. He never came, as expected, and a few days later when she called she regretted to tell me that he had been moved, expenses paid, to Virginia. This, if true, I suppose, was his reward for being a good citizen, a real patriot. In April of 1988, a researcher, joined by a person knowledgeable of military intelligence operations, visited my home to discuss an abduction case. Inevitably, the conversation drift- ed to crash/retrievals and I menti- oned the alleged crash in Brown County. \"Oh yes,\" said my knowl- edgeable guest, \"I heard that a jet crashed on a farmer's property,\" adding \"It was in an inaccessible area and they had a hard time getting the wreckage out.\" A jet? Certainly there had been nothing in the news about a jet crash- ing the previous Spring in that locality and, as we all know, airplane crashes, of any kind, always make news. Of significance, my guest also stated, \"I heard from a good source that the government came in and bought the farm and moved the owner out of town.\" Amen! Much can be said about this case, pro and con. And, I'm also omitting some details that might compromise the positions and activities of certain people involved. CASE 8) I have many other items of C/R interest, or trivia, some deserving at least a brief reference. One, concerns the disclosure of a fire department inspector, who, while fil- ing his report at my home in Sep- tember 1987, said that he was also a fireman stationed at Wright-Patterson AFB in 1967-68. Aware of all buildings on the base and access to same in case of emergency, he and crew were instructed that if a fire were reported An Ordinary\" CJFO By Raymond Fowler Mr. Fowler is MUFON Director of Investigations. On September 3, 1988, I received a phone call from Marion Reedy of Ipswich, MA at 2255 EOT. She told me that her neighbors, the Henrys, had sighted a strange lighted object during the early morning hours. I phoned the Henrys on the following day and interviewed them on that afternoon, September 4, 1988. Shortly after 0100 on the morning of September 3, 1988, Debbie Henry was preparing to retire. She heard a squeaking sound which she attributed to her cat catching a mouse outside. 14 She went to an upstairs window to look out and saw what appeared to be the bottom of a dark object with blinking yellow lights that reflected off a rectangular dark gray panel. Think- ing it might be a reflection, she went to another upstairs window to look. The object was still there, but from this vantage point she saw red, green and yellow blinking lights. The green and yellow lights seemed to be arranged in straight lines along the length of the rectangular panel's inte- rior, whereas the red lights seemed to be located around its perimeter. She then went downstairs and looked out a large living room window. To her, in a building in a certain section that they were to \"let it burn.\" A sign read, \"No Fire Trucks Allowed.\" He had heard \"rumors\" that the building housed UFO material. The year was 1953, the state Ariz- ona. Both are important in C/R activ- ity. One new source, whose informa- tion is not included in this article for reasons of his own security, was involved in a retrieval operation in that year and state; and, still another source, also not publishable for the same reason, backs up the Kingman crash, same year, same state. See Abstract 6 Retrievals of the Third Kind and Postscript On Two Key Cases, Page 43 of Status Report III, regarding Kingman crash. Also see Case A-l, Sfafus Report II, regarding three small humanoids retrieved in the state and received at Wright- Patterson AFB.

She felt that the object was only 70 feet away. Realizing now that she was observ- ing something that was really unus- ual, she ran and woke her husband Tim up. Tim took a look and told Debbie not to go out until he got dressed to go with her. Debbie came back to the bedroom with him and when they got dressed and went out- side, the object was gone. Tim's impression was that the object was 500 yards away and about 200-300 feet in the air. He admitted that it could have been closer but since there was no reference point, it was hard to know its real size and dis- tance. It was close enough to be alarming. There was no noise coming through Mutual UFO Journal. Number 249, Januan. 1W"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"an open window from the object. When Tim saw the object, the por- tion of its bottom covered with lights looked round like the bottom of a dish. It is possible that by the time Tim got out of bed to see the object that it had moved further away. The Henrys noticed a light on in the Reedy residence across the street from their house. They phoned the Reedys who came over and joined them in searching for the object. However, only the stars and Mars and Jupiter and the moon could be seen. The Henrys phoned the police at 0130 to enquire if anyone had reported the object. The police said there was nothing on the log. Interview I arrived at the Henry residence around 1400 and was met by Debbie. It was raining but she graciously accompanied me to the edge of the field over which the object had hovered. I then took compass and elevation readings. We went into the house and I was introduced to Tim. We sat down at the living room table where I questi- oned them and had them fill out MUFON Form 1 and help me to pin- point their house on a town and topographical map. Both were very cooperative and tried very hard not to embellish their experience. Both now wish that they had gone outside immediately rather than getting dressed. Debbie wished that she had informed her husband sooner, but had gone through several steps in an attempt to make sure that she wasn't seeing a reflection or something nor- mal. She just could not believe what she was seeing and wanted to make sure it was unusual before getting her husband out of bed at such a late hour. Both have college degrees. I phoned the families living in the houses bordering the field over which the object hovered. Everyone was asleep during the sighting date/time frame. I left my name and phone number for them to call me in the event they heard of other witnesses. I also phoned the Ipswich police. Nothing was recorded on their log. Mutual UFO Journal, Number 249, January 1989 Witness Background Check A neighbor described the Henrys as sincere, level-headed people who were very puzzled about what they had seen. Both are college graduates and are very articulate. Debbie teaches in the Ipswich Elementary School sys- tem. I found nothing in their charac- ters that warranted further inquiry. The shape/colors and behavior of the lights and the long-duration hov- ing capability of the apparently noise- less object seem to rule out an aircraft. The sighting was near railroad tracks and over a large open field bordered by trees, bushes and a playground. Perhaps of significance is the fact that a high-quality series of UFO sightings on April 4, 1976 occurred in Ipswich. One of the areas in which the object was sighted was over this same field. The witnesses to this current sighting were not aware of this fact; it was not seen from their neighborhood but from a vantage point at the opposite end of the field. Unfortunately, the object was always viewed through windows and not from outdoors. However, each win- dow gives a good view of the sighting area and the weather provided excel- lent visibility. I am placing this UFO report in the \"Ordinary\" category. It is obvious to me that two reliable witnesses observed an unusual aerial object which does not correspond to natural or conven- tional explanations. Ohio Flap By Richard P. Dell'Aquila I and Dale B. Wedge, MUFON State Section Directors for Cuya- hoga, Lake, Geauga and Ashtabula Counties (Ohio) have been investigat- ing a series of sightings, beginning about March 4, 1988 and seemingly centered around the Perry Nuclear Plant, and the CEI coal burning plant at Eastlake, both on the shore of Lake Erie, east of Cleveland, Ohio. March 4th was a clear, crisp night and the stars were clearly visible, especially to the north over the lake where there are no city lights. Venus and Jupiter were bright and in close proximity to each other in the west- ern sky. At about 6:30 p.m., S.B. (name and address provided to MUFON) and her children were driving home to Eastlake along the lake shore when they observed a large, blimp- like object with bright white lights at each end, hovering over the lake and rocking end to end like a \"teeter- totter.\" One light was brighter than the other and was strobing. On arriv- ing home, she asked her husband to accompany her to the beach about 200 yards north for a closer view of the object which they later described as \"larger than a football held at arm's length.\" She and her husband walked onto the beach. The noiseless object was gun-metal gray and seemed to cause the ice on the lake to rumble and crack loudly in an unusual way which frightened her. The witnesses had to shout to be heard by each other, and were surprised that no dogs were out barking as would have been expected. After observing the object for a while, the couple became concerned for the safety of their children in the car when the object revolved slowly about 90 degrees, coming almost overhead (about !4 mile high) and pointing its \"front\" end down toward them. They drove the children home and continued watching the object from their living room window which faces the lake. A neighbor was phoned and she and her son went to the beach, reporting the same thing. They took photographs which did not turn out. CESSNA-SIZE The object began to descend and the witnesses returned to the beach, where it was now observed to have 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"red and blue blinking lights along its bottom edge. It emitted 5 to 6 noise- less, intensly bright yellow triangular lights from its side. They intermit- tently hovered around the larger object, darted and zig-zagged into the night sky at velocities far in excess of known aircraft. Mr. B. stated the tri- angular objects were smaller than a one-seat Cessna and \"crossed 50 mile stretches low over the ice in the snap of a finger.\" They were said to be able to approach the shore, turn abrupt, right angles due east toward the Perry Nuclear Plant about 12 miles away, climbing rapidly and return again, all within several seconds. By this time, a Coast Guard patrol vehi- cle had arrived on the beach in response to S.B.'s several phone calls. The triangular objects came closer to the shore, causing the witnesses to become concerned that the lights on the Coast Guard vehicle would attract the objects and the lights were turned off. The triangles continued to fly off at high speed northward over the lake and eastward toward the Perry Nuclear Plant. About an hour later they returned one at a time into the large ship, which then landed on the ice. Several multi-colored lights now came on for about five minutes on the bottom of the object \"in a wave like a movie theater sign\" and the brighter white light on the end began strobing red and white. When these went off, the ice stopped making noise and everything became \"dead silent.\" The object could no longer be seen after about a half an hour and it was assumed to have gone below the surface. The next day, unusually huge pieces of broken ice were observed in the area of the landing. COASTGUARD The Coast Guard informed Mr. and Mrs. B. the following day that the Army and NASA, whom S.B. had also phoned, instructed them not to investigate the matter further or go out on the lake in their cutter to examine the ice in the area of the landing, since the matter was \"out of their league and out of their hands.\" They informed the couple that all 16 information was being forwarded to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and a facility in Detroit, Michigan. In response to a Coast Guard inquiry, Wright-Patterson refused to confirm or deny any interest in these activities. On the next night, the same wit- nesses observed several triangular objects over the lake for about 45 minutes. By the time Coast Guard personnel arrived on the scene, the objects were gone. On March 7, 1988, the Cleveland Plain Dealer and Lake County News- Herald carried articles which attrib- uted a series of reports of large brightly-lit objects over Lake Erie on the prior weekend to several wit- nesses' misidentification of the planets Venus and Jupiter. The newspaper accounts indicated that the Fairport Harbor Coast Guard went to the area and saw a large bright object that seemed to disperse smaller, bright multi-colored objects. But when they called the local air traffic con- trollers, they were \"informed\" that Jupiter and Venus were in alignment and that the colors were the result of \"spontaneous gas emissions from the two planets.\" One article even attrib- uted this amazing explanation to a professor of astronomy at a local university. On reading the articles, I felt it was unlikely that U.S. Coast Guard per- sonnel, trained in navigation and identification of basic celestial objects such as the planets, could have made such a gross misidentification. Like- wise, the statement attributed to the professor of astronomy was equally unacceptable, in that no other similar \"spontaneous gas emission\" from the planets cited, of the necessary magni- tude, had ever been noted, particu- larly on this weekend. In the course of a follow-up investi- gation by me and Wedge, a Coast Guard incident report was found (presently in MUFON's possession) which states that Coast Guard per- sonnel responded to several calls reporting UFOs over Lake Erie on the night of March 4, 1988. When the Coast Guard arrived, the report con- firms that a large object \"dispersed 3- 5 smaller flying objects that were zip- ping around rather quickly. These objects had red, green, white and yel- low lights on them that strobed intermittently. They also had the abil- ity to stop and hover in mid-flight.\" The incident report confirms Mr. and Mrs. B's reports, including the abnormal cracking of the ice as the object came closer to it and appar- ently landed. \"The smaller objects began'hovering in the area where the large object landed (about ] / 4 mile east of the CEI power plant) and after a few minutes they began flying around again.\" The report adds that, \"One of the small objects turned on a spot- light where the large object had been, but [the Coast Guard personnel] could not see anything, and then the object seemed to disappear. Anoth- er object approached us approxi- mately 500 yards offshore about 20 feet above the ice, and it began mov- ing closer as [the Coast Guard] began flashing its headlights, then it moved off to the west.\" A subsequent Coast Guard report (also in possession of MUFON) pre- pared after the sightings of the follow- ing night attributes the sightings to misidentifications of the planets Venus and Jupiter and says, \"the flashing lights are gases in the atmosphere ... Request incident closed this unit.\" In response to a classified advertisement placed by the investigators, other witnesses contacted us and have been interviewed as the investigation continues. On the same night (March 4th) at about 10:00 p.m., and continuing until approximately 10:30 p.m., C.H. (name and address provided to MUFON) also reported a UFO near her home, which is a few miles south of the lake shore and just east of the Perry Nuclear Plant. C.H. was walking a puppy when she noticed the station- ary triangular object in the southeast- erly sky. It was much brighter than the moon, and seemed to upset the puppy which she took back indoors. Returning outdoors, she reported that the object began sequentially flashing multi-colored lights, suspended in rows below the base of the triangle. The witness responded by flashing her cigarette lighter and the UFO's light pattern became more erratic. At on*? point, the triangle revolved clockwise, Mutual UFO Journal. Number 249, January 19S9"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"turning its apex about 90 degrees to a horizontal position, but still flashing the rows of light. After several min- utes, it turned back counter-clockwise as it simultaneously accelerated away to the south at a high rate of speed, disappearing behind some trees. No noise or odor was reported. SIMILAR SIGHTINGS At about 10:30 p.m. that night T.K. (name and address provided to MUFON), took a photograph in his back yard, within a few miles of the Perry Nuclear Plant, showing a por- tion of a brightly lit triangular object travelling across the sky (photograph in possession of MUFON). This object was later confirmed by Mr. and Mrs. B and C.H. to be identical to the tri- angular objects they were also observ- ing about the same time a few miles away, and is also similar to one reported to Phil Imbrogno as having been near the Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant in New York State on the same night. T.K. and his friend were outdoors on the night of March 4th, observing the stars through his telescope. Venus and Jupiter were reported to be in the western sky behind a stand of trees. While looking southward through the telescope, out of the corner of his left eye, T.K. noticed a bright, moving object in the sky. He and his friend were awe-struck by the triangular object, but he did have the presence of mind to take three photographs with a small \"snapshot\" type camera loaded with Kodak 110 color film, with which they had intended to pho- tograph stars through the telescope. Only one photograph turned out. It is the last in the series, taken while panning ahead of the object, and shows the front portion of the trian- gle. The object was described as about 3-4 inches tall at arm's length and glowing an intense yellow/orange to white, with a bright orange/red glow behind it. It seemed to pulse brighter and dimmer, moving in a roughly southwesterly direction until it was obscured by trees. As it moved, it accelerated, slowed and accelerated again. No sound or smell was noted, although his dog had a strong reaction, running in circles and tugging on T.K.'s sleeve, apparently in an attempt to urge him away from the object. Total time of observation was a few minutes. We continue to receive reports of additional UFOs over the same period, some supported by photo- graphs and the sightings continue to the date of this writing. Supplemen- tary reports will be provided as the investigation of the flap progresses. Health Effects: A Response By Dr. Michael A. Persinger The comments by Grant Cameron in the November, 1988 issue concern- ing my article entitled \"Possible in- creased cancer and depression risk among UFO field researchers and populations near flap areas\" are replete with misconceptions. Because Mr. Cameron presents himself as a rela- tively normal person, with the possi- ble exception of a low gelastic thresh- old, perhaps his comments reflect my failure to clearly present the ideas. Let me clarify two of the most impor- tant conceptual errors committed by Mr. Cameron. First, the tectonic strain hypothesis does not state that UFO-like luminos- ities are generated by earthquakes. The hypothesis predicts that regional tectonic strain, as reflected by regional earthquake activity, are the causal factors in the generation of these luminosities. Earthquakes and lumin- osities are correlated because they are generated by the same process: variations in regional stresses. As they slowly accumulate, depending Mutual UFO Journal, Number 249, January 1989 upon local geology and the history of stress release, luminosities may be observed weeks to months (a typical geophysical time frame) before an actu- al fracture or seismic event occurs within the region. The display of anomalous lights immediately in the vicinity and within a few hours of an earthquake is simply a more obvious subset of this condition. According to the hypothesis (see Persinger and Derr, Perceptual and Motor Skills, 1985, 61, 807-813), the most likely earthquake that followed and accompanied the strain condi- tions that generated the 1975 Carman lights was the unprecedented, large magnitude earthquake in the south- ern extent of the Red River near its origin along the Minnesota-North Dako- ta border during July of that year. The secondary series of displays, that lasted until September, 1976 was punctuated by the second largest release of seismic energy for that region during this period. If more lights have occurred very recently near Carman and they were sub- jected to the same careful collection criteria that was employed by Chris Rutkowski, then the recent occurren- ces might be: 1) predictors of another quake within this region, and 2) a means to test the predictive validity of the hypothesis within this area. The second conceptual error report- ed by Mr. Cameron involves his reflexive rejection of potential health effects. If luminosities are generated by the forces that have been postu- lated, then a public risk factor must be considered (its determination is also an ethical responsibility of the scientist if the tectonic strain hypothe- sis is valid). For every single case that Mr. Cameron contends there are no long term sequelae, I can state a case where there has been such changes; one example is the occurrence of a brain tumor within one of the close observers of the initial Medjugorji phenomenon. However, anecdotal rea- soning does not support or refute hypotheses that involve heterogene- 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"ous or multivariate phenomena, such as the UFO problem. As stated in the August 1988 MUFON Journal article, the magni- tude of any effect would be within epidemiological ranges, such as greater than 10 to 20 cases per 100,000 peo- ple for brain tumors and greater than 1 to 4 cases per 100 people for psy- chological depression; the specific risk ratio would be modulated by proximity to and duration of expo- sure to these luminosities. Manifesta- tions of the effect would be specific and include primarily disorders (psy- chological depression and brain tumors in adults) that are promoted by main- tained ACTH (adrenocorticotrophic hormone) elevations in conjunction with low level current induction within the body. In the Carman, Manitoba region, depression cases should have increased during the years 1975 through 1978; elevated, cumulative incidence of brain tumors (since 1976), which would require access to the cancer registry, would be more difficult to determine because of the small popu- lation size. Only a carefully con- ducted study, not nonchalant tele- phone interviews, would answer the question. Special emphasis might be given to people who lived within the spatial focus of the 1975-76 observa- tions (even if they did not report UFOs), compared to a reference population. Perhaps Mr. Cameron might obtain the help of a resident epidemiologist at the University of Manitoba. Many of us who have experience in medical geography and geochemical epidemiology clearly recall the flip- pant mentality that preceded the demonstration that low level radiation downwind from the White Sands Testing Grounds caused thyroidal cancer (due to the unexpected, selec- tive accumulation of radioactive iodine within this organ during its fetal development) or the tragic conse- quences of Love Canal in New York state. Sometimes the environmental basis of even blatant pathology has been difficult to establish, especially if the agent is variable in time and space; Minamata's disease in Japan, is a classic example. Even though the risk factors from repeated, close proximity to luminosities appear to be much smaller at this time, clear and careful study is required. Concern for the public health, Mr. Cameron, should evoke consideration, not indis- criminant laughter. Survey of Ufologists and Beliefs in Unexplained Phenomena By Donald A. Johnson, Ph.D. MUFON Consultant in Research Psychology In order to learn what beliefs UFOlogists hold about paranormal phenomena — particularly parapsy- chological phenomena — and to determine whether a relationship exists between witnessing UFO events and belief in psychic abilities, I conducted a small survey of attendees of the 1983 MUFON Symposium, held in Pasadena, California. This report pre- sents the results from that survey. There were three things I hoped to accomplish by conducting this sur- vey. The first goal was mainly des- criptive: to determine what pattern of beliefs exists among UFOlogists in the various paranormal phenomena listed in the questionnaire. I thought it would be interesting to find out to what degree these beliefs differ from those held by the general public. The comparison data was supplied by a survey of 1553 adults conducted by the Gallup Poll in February 1978. The results were reported by Jeff Sobal 18 Table 1 Age and Education of MUFON Respondents Age Category 18-29 Years 30-49 Years 40-49 Years 50-64 Years 65 Years and Over Educational Level 11 Years or Less 12 Years 13-15 Years 16 Years 17 Years or More Percent 3 24 30 28 100% 0 8 25 28 100% and Charles Emmons in the Zetetic Scholar (1). The second purpose of the survey was to discover if UFO witnesses differ significantly from non-witnesses in their beliefs in unexplained pheno- mena, and especially to determine whether UFO witnesses have higher rates of belief in unexplained pheno- mena. Such a finding, if replicated, might lead to the conclusion that UFO witnesses, as a group, have a lower threshold of acceptance for phenomena not recognized or explain- ed by current scientific paradigms. It could suggest that they are less skep- tical and more credulous than non- witnesses. Evidence of this kind would tend to cast doubt on the validity of at least some UFO eyewitness tes- timony, because the ability of these observers to distinguish inexplicable phenomena from everyday events would be called into question. The third objective was to test the hypothesis that a relationship exists between belief in one's own psychic abilities and the witnessing of UFO phenomena. A correspondence between belief in psychic ability and witnessing Mutual UFO Journal, Number 249, January 1989"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"UFO events has been hypothesized by a number of authors, and some tentative evidence to support such a relationship was presented by Benton Jamison (2) at the 1976 C.U.F.O.S. Conference. This relationship, should it exist, could have a variety of causes. It could be that greater open- mindedness and perceptiveness on the part of psychic UFO witnesses allows them to witness possibly paranor- mal aspects of the UFO phenomena; it might be that psychic individuals are selected to witness UFO events; or it could be that so-called \"psy- chics\" are simply more gullible and more easily fooled by misperceived stimuli. The survey was designed to elicit beliefs about UFOs and other unex- plained phenomena. Two hundred questionnaires were distributed at the conference, and 70 completed questi- onnaires were returned, representing a 35% response rate. However, some of the participants were allowed to take and keep an extra copy of the questionnaire, so the actual participa- tion rate may be higher. Since this is a \"convenience\" sample and not a true probability sample of UFO research- ers, inferences about the generaliza- bility of the results are generally not warranted. However, it is my opinion that the answers provided by the sample probably reflect the views of a sub-population of those individuals identified as \"UFOlogists\". This group consists of those people with enough interest in the UFO phenomenon to attend a conference, and with suffi- cient interest in the general purposes of this survey to participate. Questionnaire The questionnaire consisted of two brief paragraphs describing the study, three questions on respondent's beliefs regarding the UFO phenomenon, twelve questions on other unexplained pheno- mena drawn from the Gallup Poll survey, four questions on belief in one's own psychic abilities, and two questions on how often the respond- ent had witnessed a UFO. All questi- onnaires were completed anonym- ously.

A few survey participants objected to using the term \"belief\" to define their opinions about the existence of paranormal phenomena. While I read- ily concede that the word is not the best choice of terms because of the religious connotation associated with its use, it was necessary to retain the terminology used by the Gallup Poll to insure comparability with their results. I don't believe that it infe- rered with anyone's interpretation of the meaning of the questions.

Ninety-one percent listed their racial or ethnic group as White, while 3% were Hispanic, 3% Black, and 3% Asian. Two of the Black respondents also indicated they were part Ameri- can Indian. Only two of the respond- ents were younger than thirty. In general, survey participants tended to be middle-aged and very well edu- cated, as Table 1 shows. Almost half (46%) of the respondents had wit- nessed at least one UFO, and one- third reported having seen UFOs on more than one occasion. If we assume that the sample of UFOlogists is truely representative of a larger population, then we can dis- regard for the moment the inappro- priateness of applying statistical tests to the results of a \"convenience\" sample. Concerning the first goal of the survey, it turns out that UFOlo- gists can be categorized as similar to the general public in their beliefs in paranormal activity, except that they are significantly less likely to believe in angels, devils, and astrology, and significantly more likely to believe in evidence for psychic phenomena and the existence of valid cryptqzoologic claims. Table 2 presents the results of the beliefs question. In general, the Gallup Poll results reveal that the more education one has the more likely one is to believe in psychic abilities. When compared to only those with college training, the differences in belief in psychic phenomena become less noticeable. Belief in precognition and clairvoy- ance are still significantly more com- mon among UFOlogists than among the college trained general public, but no significant differences remain for \"ESP\" or \"deja vu\". The results on whether UFOlogists who report having seen a UFO differ in their beliefs from UFOlogists who have never had a UFO sighting are not definitive. On the one hand, there was a trend among some who have witnessed the UFO phenomenon to be less critical of other unexplained 20 Table 4 Comparison of the psychic ability beliefs of UFO witnesses and non-witnesses Believe have some ability to gain extra-sensory perceptions (ESP) of thoughts and feelings of other people (telepathy)?

However, the sample size is not sufficient to make any conclusions about that trend. The data are reported in Table 3. The data are presented in two ways: with the percentage who had responded \"yes\" to each of the \"do you believe in\" statements; and as an average of the numeric values of the responses, with \"no\" coded 1, \"?\" coded 2, and \"yes\" coded 3. There were 31 who reported having had at least one UFO sighting and 36 who reported not hav- ing had any sightings. The differences between the two groups were greatest for beliefs in religious phenomena such as angels and life after death, and for the \"Hal- loween\" associated phenomena of ghosts and witches. While these dif- ferences prove nothing, they do sug- gest that the non-witnesses show more skepticism in general, which might lead one to infer that they also have a higher threshold for rejecting unusual phenomena they personally observe as lacking a mundane expla- nation. Conversely, it may also be seen as evidence suggesting that at least some UFO witnesses are less skeptical and more credulous than non-witnesses. In one respect, \"see- ing\" does seem to equate with \"believ- ing\": respondents who had witnessed UFOs more than once were signifi- cantly more likely to say that UFOs are extraterrestrial visitors (87°o) than those who had never witnessed the UFO phenomenon or had witnessed it only once (59%). There were no significant differen- ces between a belief in one's own psychic abilities and whether or not one has personally witnessed the UFO phenomenon. Table 4 displays these results for both witnesses and non-witnesses. However, there irere significant differences for the number of UFO encounters for both belief in pre-cognition ability and psychokine- sis ability. Those who responded yes to the pre-cognition question reported an average of 2.9 UFO sightings compared to an average of one UFO sighting for the remainder of the sample. Those who felt they had an ability with psychokinesis reportedly had seen UFOs an average of 3.33 times, compared to 1.1 times for those who said they did not have :h<? ability or weren't sure.

Before we lend further credence to this latter inter- pretation it would behoove us to test these individuals under controlled, laboratory conditions to determine whether these abilities can indeed be proven to exist.

Looking Back By Bob Gribble FORTY YEARS AGO - January 1949: A huge, mysterious ball of light suddenly appeared from the night sky MUTUAL UFO Journal, Number 249, January 1989 and slowly circled the control tower at the greater Cincinnati, Ohio Air- port (date unknown). One of the two tower controllers tried to contact the UFO by radio but got no response. As the object came closer, \"under control,\" both controllers fled the tower in panic. *** THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO - January 1954: An experienced pilot, Captain D. Barker of the A.N.A. air- line, observed a UFO above the Yarra Valley, Victoria, Australia, at 10:15 a.m. on the first. \"It was huge, was shaped like a metallic mushroom, at least four times as big as a DC-3 and ten times as fast,\" Barker said. Other observers said the object \"seem- ed to have a transparent glass-like dome.\" The craft was in sight for about 12 seconds. On the 14th, a large fiery object was seen dropping from the sky near Idyllwild, (Now John F. Kennedy International Airport) New York City at about 5:30 p.m. Immediately after- ward, a B-47 pilot flying in the area notified the tower that \"an unknown object just hit our wing.\" The dam- aged wing did not crumple, and the pilot nursed the plane to a safe land- ing. *** THIRTY YEARS AGO - Janu- ary 1959: Kenneth Leland was flying as a radar observer (date unknown), in a two-man jet based at Duluth Air Force Base, Minnesota, when his plane was scrambled after a UFO. \"At that time there were quite a few UFO spottings,\" he said. \"In this par- ticular case, the UFO we were involved with was definitely on the radar in our plane. The object was actually over a radar station in Fin- land, Minnesota, northeast of Duluth. We heard on the radio that some of the fellows at the radar site had gone outside and looked at it, hovering over the station. But by the time we got there it was gone. The people on the ground there said the UFO went from about 1000 feet to 200 miles high and left the area completely in a very brief period of time.\" On the 17th the U.S. Air Force admitted that the pursuit, study, and investigation of UFOs had cost the government $200 million to date. 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Most of this money was spent by the Air Force, although the Army, Navy, Coast Guard, Civil Aeronautics Admin- istration and Central Intelligence Agen- cy also figured in running up the total. The $200 million outlay includes an estimated $25 to $30 million for aircraft lost or destroyed while chas- ing UFOs. (Note: as early as 1954 General Benjamin Chidlow — while commanding an Air Force Base in Colorado — admitted \"we have lost many men and planes trying to inter- cept them (the UFOs)\" and added he was seriously concerned about these losses, as were others.) *** FIFTEEN YEARS AGO - Janu- ary 1974: Captain Lars Berglund was piloting a Boeing 727 on the 26th and it had just passed over Lisbon, Por- tugal at 2:59 a.m. when he spotted a formation of 10 or 15 discs. The entire group of discs were in sight for only one minute. The co-pilot and mechanic also viewed the formation. Soon after the discs passed by, a Portuguese aircraft called ground con- trol at Lisbon reporting that they had observed the formation, giving the same description as that of Bergu- land. A Norwegian and British aircraft crew also reported the formation of discs. *** TEN YEARS AGO - January 1979: A Transvaal woman and her son claimed that they had encoun- tered a UFO and five or six strange beings on a lonely road. Mrs. Meagan Quezet and her son Andre, 12, of Min- dalore, near Krugersdorp, South Afri- ca, said they encountered a brightly- colored craft shortly after midnight on the fourth — and claimed \"strange creatures\" tried to communicate with them. They said it started when Andre found himself unable to sleep, and all the dogs in the neighborhood began barking. Their dog ran off down the road, and mother and son followed. They said they saw a bright pink light just over a rise and then encountered the craft and dark skinned beings wearing \"white or pink suits.\" The Night Sky By Walter N. Webb MUFON Astronomy Consultant January 1989 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Mars, moving from Pisces into Aries, stands high in the south at dusk. Fading past zero magnitude, the red planet now sets in the west about 12:30 AM in midmonth. It gradually is closing on Jupiter and passes the giant world in March. This month the Moon passes first Mars on the 14th and then Jupiter two nights later. Jupiter, in Taurus, is visible high in the SE at dusk. Shining at magnitude -2.6 in mid-January, this planet resumes eastward motion on the 20th. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus (magnitude -3.9) slides by Saturn (+0.5) on the morning of January 16. Our neighbor world can be seen then only 0.6° below the much dimmer ringed giant. Use binoculars or a telescope. Both planets are very low in the SE at dawn. After the 16th, Venus moves nearer the horizon each morning, while Saturn ascends higher in the sky. The crescent Moon is near Venus on the 5th. Jupiter sets in the NW about 3 AM in midmonth. Meteor Shower: The Quadrantid meteors peak during the predawn hours of the 3rd. The shower is composed mostly of slow, faint, bluish meteors which radiate from Bootes in the NE. This year North America is favored by the shower which has a rather sharply defined short peak. The rate can range any- where from perhaps 40 to more than 100 per hour. The crescent Moon may interfere slightly. Moon Phases: New moori — January 7 First quarter — January 14 Full moon — January 21 Last quarter — January 29 The Stars: C o 22 Continued next page The night sky of January features some of the brightest stars in the heav- ens. Orion the Hunter now dominates the southern sky and with its char- acteristic hourglass figure is perhaps the easiest of all constellations to spot. Because of its position above the equator, Orion is visible from many places on Earth. The pattern played an important role in the mythology of cultures throughout the world. The great warrier serves as a guidepost to almost all of the interesting stars of the season. A line through the three \"belt\" stars toward the SE points to the brightest luminary in the night sky, Sirius the Dog Star.

The tiny star cluster called the Pleiades is supposed to be a spear-wound in the bull's shoulder. Aldebaran and Sirius are two of the first-magnitude stars which form the Winter Circle surrounding Orion. Don't forget to look at the fuzzy middle \"star\" in the hunter's sword — the great Orion Nebula, a glowing cloud of gas and dust and a seasonal favorite of amateur astronomers.

MESSAGE, Continued above project, MUFON has con- sented to supply a confidential com- puterized list of all our members who are classified as Consultants (only). This list does not include our officers who serve in dual roles such as State Directors and Consultants, etc. Howard Hoffman, J.D., a UFO researcher in the Washington, DC area, has agreed to do the leg-work on this project, compiling the list of scientists and mailing out the statement for them to sign. Howard is an associate of CUFQS and a Consultant in Law to MUFON. May I advise each MUFON Consultant that this is a voluntary MUTUAL UFO Journal, Number 249, January 1989 program, however, we invite your participation. News Around the Network The theme for the MUFON 1989 International UFO Symposium in Las Vegas, Nevada at the Aladdin Hotel and Casino on June 30, July 1 and 2, will be \"The UFO Cover-Up.\" Speak- ers presently committed are William L. \"Bill\" Moore and Donald A. Johnson, Ph.D. Letters of invitation to other speakers are pending their acceptance with more to be mailed. With the presidential election behind her, Marge Christensen has rein- stated her active involvement as MUFON's Director of Public Educa- tion, a role in which she is highly qualified based upon several years of outstanding achievements. (She is presently working on another signifi- cant UFO public education project that will be announced when it has been confirmed.) Robert H. Bletch- man, Director of Public Relations, is constantly on the alert for significant UFO related news that could be developed into a MUFON News Release, potentially impacting the gen- eral public and government agencies. Please contact Mr. Bletchman by tel- ephone at his office (203) 643-2433 or his home (203) 646-5237 with your ideas. Three candidates have been nomi- nated for Eastern Regional Director to fill the vacancy created when Joe Santangelo's term expires on the Board of Directors this year. Listed alphabetically they are Stephen J. Firmani, State Director for Massa- chusetts; Robert L. Oechsler, State Section Director for Anne Arundel, Howard and Calvert Counties in Maryland; and Donald M. Ware, State Director for Florida. Nomina- tions will be closed on January 31, 1989, therefore this will be the last opportunity to nominate a candidate for this important position. A ballot will be enclosed in a future issue of the Journal to all members in the Eastern Region of states so they may cast their vote for Regional Director. \"Interviewing the UFO Witness,\" a 45-minute VHS videotape produced by Michigan MUFON, Inc. is now available for $15.00 U.S. (including postage and handling). Narrated by Dan Wright, MUFON Deputy Direc- tor of Investigations, the program depicts a field investigator in a variety of circumstances. This is an ideal means for training field investigators in a classroom environment or better still for the field investigator trainee that is somewhat isolated geographi- cally and does not have the benefit of group instruction.

The monthly magazine SKYLOOK, official publica- tion of the Mutual UFO Network, was founded in September 1967. In June 1976 the name was changed to the MUFON UFO JOURNAL to more accurately describe its purpose, since SKYLOOK may have sounded like an astronomy organization. MUFON has grown since its founding on May 31, 1969 from a central states regional organization, appropriately called the Midwest UFO Network, to its pres- ent worldwide international scope. The name was changed to the Mutual UFO Network in late 1973 to better reflect the goals and purposes of the organization and to eliminate the geographical connotation which had become obsolete. Membership will exceed 2000 early in 1989. New Officers New officers appointed during Novem- ber to stay abreast of the continued growth of MUFON are the following: O. Faruk Imamoglu, M.A. of Balgat, Ankara, Representative for Turkey. William I. McNcff, State Director for Minnesota, reassigned and appoint- ed these State Section Directors, Richard C. \"Buddy\" Bauerlein for Hennepin, Carver and Scott counties; Robert E. Engberg for Ramsey and Dakota counties (Bob is a former State Director for both MN and ND); and John D. Dingley for Washing- ton and Anoka counties. Donald A. Curtis, State Director for Iowa selected Michael E. Brunner of Cedar Rap- ids for Linn and Jones counties. Wal- ter N. Hnot, Jr., J.D. (Amateur Radio Operator KB2FMZ) of Phillips- burg, NJ was appointed State Section Director for Warren and Hunterdon counties by Tom Benson. David R. Hillendahl of Houston, TX is replacing Richard Holt as State Section Director for Harris County. David was instrumental in helping Max Washburn and Richard Holt with their recent UFO Confer- ence in Houston, featuring John F. Schuessler and Budd Hopkins. New Consultants volunteering their expertise are Michel Granger, Ph.D. of Chalon/Saone, France for Chemis- try; Jeffrey H. Utter, Ph.D., living in Pasadena, California in Sociology of Religion; Henry Azadehdel, Ph.D., residing in Nottingham, England for Physics and a Research Specialist in Abduction Cases; and John C. Kasher, Ph.D., of Omaha, Nebraska for Phys- ics. The following new Research Spe- cialists have been appointed: Luis A. Caso, M.A, of Jamaica Queens, NY for Criminal Justice; Donald A. Haines, M.S., living in East Lansing, Michigan in Atmospheric Sciences; Severn L. Schaeffer, M.A. of Paris, France for Medical Epistemology; and John W. Herrick, Jr. M.A., in Cor pus Christi, TX in Clinical Psychology and Hypnotherapy. Fund For UFO Research Projects The Mutual UFO Network is sup- porting two major projects initiated by the Fund for UFO Research (FUFOR) under the direction of Dr. Bruce S. Maccabee, Chairman. In order to continue the research into the validity and possible perpetuation of the MJ-12 committee, established by President Harry S. Truman, Stanton T. Friedman, nuclear phys- icist, has been contracted to explore and research MJ-12 to an ultimate conclusion for $16,000 on a full time basis. As of December 15, 1988, Frederick Whiting advised that $11,000 of this goal has been reached. Dona- tions and gifts are still being accepted by making a check payable to Fund for UFO Research, P.O. Box 277, Mount Rainier, Maryland 20822. (MUFON has contributed $500 to this project.) In a letter addressed to Mark Rodeghier and Walter Andrus, Dr. Maccabee outlined the following propo- sal as the second project and I quote: \"The Fund for UFO Research has begun a project 7 to get as many scientists as possible — hopefully, several hundred — to sign a state- ment that UFO reports merit scien- tific study. We think a project like this is long overdue, and that the list of scientists could be very useful for many purposes. We would like to ask your organizations to join us in this project, so that CUFOS, the Fund, and MUFON would be equal sponsors. \"The project is straight-forward. We recommend setting a goal of col- lecting the signatures of 200-300 scien- tists around the world. The list of scientists could be used for the pur- poses agreed on by CUFOS, the Fund, and MUFON. We recommend that these purposes include: (1) facili- tating \"networking\" among scientists, (2) informing the media, (3) publica- tion in the MUFON UFO Journal and IUR, (4) informing congressional offices and (5) soliciting contributions from wealthy individuals and founda- tions. \"We recommend that 'scientist' include any person with a Ph.D. or M.D. degree, and any person profes- sionally engaged in scientific activities. (Stan Friedman and Walter Webb are good examples of this last cate- gory.) We would then draft a state- ment for the scientists to sign. It would also give the scientists an opportunity to make additional com- ments. The Fund would also solicit brief biographic information from the scientists.\" MUFON has always maintained its membership list confidential in spite of the numerous requests from organ- izations, businesses, publications, and individuals.
