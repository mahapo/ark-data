Exen though the name Midwest UFO Network, Inc. implies a geo- f* graphical area of the United States, MUFON now operates in States from Maine to Florida, and from New York to California with State- Section Directors, State Directors or both. We have Field Investiga- tors in numerous other States which are not counted in our tabula- tions for state organizations. With the appointment of Ivan T. Thom- son, P. 0. Box 396, Sioux Falls, S. Dakota, 57101 as State-Section Director for the South Dakota counties of Minnehaha, Moody, Luke, McCook, Turner, Clay, Union and Yankton, MUFON is actively conducting UFO research in twenty-six of our fifty states. We have thus passed the half-way point in about three and one half years of steady and solid growth. Calvin R. Shanks, 1126 East Washington, Washington, Iowa 52353 has accepted the position of State-Section Director for Washington and Henry counties in the \"Tall Corn State.\" As a relatively young organization in the UFO field, MUFON has many accomplishments to point to with pride in which it has been the leader. As we prepare to publish the second edition of our Field Inveatigatorts Manual (the original edition was published, copyrighted and distributed in 19711, a well known international UFO group has just started distributing copies of their manual this past month. Our Annual Midwest UFO Conferences, sterting in 1970, have attracted world- wide attention for the caliber of speakers and the professional format of our published proceedings in book form. Plans are presently being formulated for the locations for the 1973 and 1974 Symposiums. The host city and date for the 1973 Hidwest UFO Symposium will be announced in the very near future in SKYLOOK, our official publication. Ye can be equally proud of Nrs. Norma E. Short, editor and publisher of SKYLOOK, and her very competent staff, as this monthly UFO publi- cation has earned for itself one of the top rankings in the UFO field. As the year 1972 draws to a close, it is very appropriate that we acknowledge the outstanding work that has been done at the state, community and individual levels by the talented members of MUFON. To each of you, my wife Jeanne and I wish you and your family a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year for the Yuletide season. The officer8 of MUFON convey their best wishes and would like to thank you person- ally for your loyal support during the past year.

The articles - were written by Robert B. Klinn and David Branch in Los Angeles, and appeared in the Register on Oct. 25th and Nov lst, 1972. They were sent to SKYLOOK by Prof. Emer. Charles G. Kahlert, of Seal Beach, Calif., and we feel this could be one of the most important reports of 1972. ----- Photographic engineer Norman F. Schulte revealed in Los Angeles on October 18, 1972, the only known infrared pictures of UFOs made by technically qualified personnel. The films were taken by Schulte and two co-workers, Bob Forrester and LaRue Stillwell while the three were employed in the photographic engineering department of North American Aviation's El Segundo facility. On the morning of March 5, 1955, Schulte and Stillwell had decided to photograph, from Los Angeles, atmospheric atomic tests being conduct- ed at Frenchman's Flat, Nevada. They felt that they could obtain better . city-skyline pictures than those previously published and they set up two Speed Graphic l+ X5 cameras, with Ektar lenses, on a vacant lot in Baldwin Hills. Stillwell used standard Type B film. But Schulte used a red-sensitive Type C film, Tri-X. (Tri-X manufactured now is a diff- erent type of film from that made in 1955.) he also equipped his camera with a 25-A red filter, thinking a red-sensitive film might record the bomb blast more distinctly. khen Stillwell came out of the lab with two prints he had just pro- cessed, one his and one Shulte's, he jokingly remarked, \"Hey, Norm, you've got a flying saucer on yow picture.\" There was a very clear, distinct little object in the middle of the picture. Under a magnifying loop it looked even more curious. Stillwell blew it up about 50 diameters and it looked even more unexplainable--and another unknown object was found, small and like the first, dome-shaped. This decided the two to get into the infrared investigation of UFOs and Bob Forrester, also interested, joined them in a series of experi- ments. The infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum (the entire spect- rum being all kinds of electromagnetic radiation) consists of invisible heat waves of varying frequencies. Invisible infrared is an extension of and is contiguous to the red end of the visible light spectrum. The men knew that the human eye can perceive only a small fraction of the electromagnetic spectrum. If UFOs could operate in invisible areas of the spectrum two puzzling asgects of many UFO reports would be clarified ; sudden disappearances of the objects, often described as \"ike someone turning offa light bulb,\" and appearances on radar of apparently solid targets invisible to the naked eye. \"We were getting very strange images every night,\" Schulte says of the experiments. \"And this happened for about 30 consecutive nights before we discontinued the project. Only one or two times did we draw a blank. In 28 or 29 of the shots we had one i~ges more; everything from crescents to boomerangs and ovals. There were cigar, domed, and elliptical-shaped objects--very distinct, very clear cut, very intenso.\" \"We eliminated all possibilitiesof any kind of error or conventional explanation such as fogging, chemical defect or reflections,\" Schulte states. . . We did as much analytical work as we could' on the photographs. We determined thbt there was something in the skies over the airport that shouldn't be there. And these objects could not be seen with the naked eye. We were all convinced that we had hotographed UFOs.\" P (Continued on next page 3"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"An official of the Federal Aviation Administration in Los Angeles confirmed privately to the writers who interviewed Schulte that nun- - erous visual sightings of UFOs, around the time of Schulte's experi- ,merits, had been made by Los Angeles airport tower operators. Schulte's group discontinued its experiments, which were known to the 13 or 14 night-shift employees of the North American photographic engineering department. Schulte kept the infrared negatives at his home. About three weeks later, in early May, 1955, Schulte was con- tacted by an Air Force officer. Schulte was drying prints one evening--in a classified department-- andlooked up to see the stranger sitting at his sorting table. Small talk led somehow to UFOs and the infrared pictures. The man asked if he could see the pictures. Schulte told him they were at home whereupon the man became very indignent and wondered why property of North American should be at Schulte's home. Schulte told him the pictures were not the property of North American and the man demanded that he bring them in. \"About that time, he brought out a military officer's identification card. It said 'Captain' somebody. I don't remember his name, but the surname 'Scott1 comes to mind. He told me he was from the Air Material Command at Wright-Patterson Air - Force Base and that he had heard about UFO pictures made at North Amer- ican, and that it was his impression they were property of North Amer- ican and that he was sent out here from Ohio to obtain the negatives for inyeatigation and analysis,\" Schulte said. 1'1 said I'd be glad to lend them to him for analysis providing I got them back. He said he couldn't guarantee that I'd get them back. I said, 'Well, if you can't guarantee 1'11 get them back, you can't have them.' Then it got to the point where he was virtually demanding them and said he was going to confiscate them.\" The hot words continued and the alleged officer threatened Schulte with the loss of his job \"for security breaches.\" Schulte said he nvirgually told him to go fly a kite. And I have the negatives in my possession ever since.\" The Air Force has claimed for years that it has never attempted con- fiscation of UFO photog,raphs or pressured in any way citizens who have taken such pictures. \"I have the highest regard for the government's security system, and all my clearances are still in effect to date,\" Schulte states. \"No further pressure, to my knowledge, wes ever brought to bear. My security clearances included Top Secret Military Informstion and an AEC \"Qn clearance. To continue accusing me of security breaches would have . seemed tantamount to admitting to the existence of information and an agency classified above Top Secret Military Information.ll Does a UFO investigative agency classed above TOP SbCRET exist? . f SO concludes the articles.7 UFO Observed Near Greenridge. Mo. Mrs. E. C., of kansas City, Mo:, wrote Ted Phillips after hearing him speak on a radio program that durlng the summer of 1948, she was living in Greenridge, Mo., with her parente. While playing in theyard, she looked up at the sound of plane. She saw the plane and also another object at . high altitude. It appeared to be round and had a whitish-metallic glint in the bright sunlight. It traveled from west to east at a greater speed than that of planes at that time. when about directly overhead, it made . a long curving turn to the south and finally disappeared from view. The girl called to her mother who also watched the object. 4"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Troy Woman Reports Sighting to Study Group Director - Object Also Seen By Director's Wife, Kathy Schuessler, at O'Fallon, Mo. Mrs. Erna Stiner, a hairdresser in Troy, Mo., was on her way to her home on Route 1, four miles from Troy, between 7:30 and 8:00 p.m. Oct. 17, 1972, when she saw a bright sky object which she was unable to identify. Mrs. Stiner was driving south and east on Highway J and noticed the bright light shortly after crossing the railroad track at south Troy. After the first glimpse, the light was hidden behind trees and wasn't seen again for another mile when Mrs. Stiner turned east on Highway U. It wes a misty night with no stars visible, and there had been rain earlier. The bright light, remaining at the same elevation and apparently three miles distant was traveling to the northeast. It appeared to have three or four brilliant white lights with a soft glow about each. The weather conditions could have accounted for the \"glowR Mrs. Stiner thought. As her husband wasn't home at the time, Mrs. Stiner drove on past her home to her parents' home a short distance north; and she, with Mr. and Mrs. Ernie Buenemann, stood on the front porch, facing east and watched the object for several minuter. During this time the iights went completely out and then came on again twice. Then the object suddenly took on speed and was out of sight in seconds. Because some farm machinery was in operation, no other sound could be detected. Unexpected corroboration of the sighting came when Mrs. Stiner called John Schuessler, Director of the St. Louis Study %oup of Greater St. Louis, at his home in OtFallon, KO., to report the in- cident. Mrs. Schuessler was standing by the kitchen window at 7:30 that evening (being sure of the time because of a TV program just coming on) and saw an unusual light approaching from the west. It flew directly over the house at low altitude, but there was no sound of an aircraft or the usual vibration in the building when a plane flies over. Mrs. Schuessler reports the object was large and moving rlowly and she saw a row of four lights, all white. ---------- Research Balloon Lands; Seen Over 4 States A high-altitude research balloon that had been visible over a four- state area Sunday, Sunday Oct. 1, 1972, plummeted to earth near Leban- on, Tenn. Monday as its 4$00-~ound payload parachuted into a wooded area near Interstate 40. A nine-member recovery team from Raven Industris of Sioux Falls, S.D., was nearby to retrieve the package of scientific instruments with the aid of a rented crane. The balloon w6s launched Sunday near Cape Girardesu, Mo., as part of wSkyhook,w a joint Navy-National Aeronautics and Space Administration research program and was designed to measure cosmic ray activity in the , upper atmosphere. The sun's reflection off the balloon'sdtin at a height of more than 130,000 feet brought hundreds of telephone calls about a bright object to various government agencies.

The area was rolling, apsreely populated farm land with no lakes or marshes in the vicinity. Stern were visible in the partly cloudy pre-dawn sky. There was little traffic-- only two cars were seen in an approximate 12-minute period. Mr. Wazny was driving 55-60 mph and had just crested a hill at the intersection of Hinson and M-81 when he first saw the light which was making a sweeping motion across the road, traveling perhaps 300-600 yards each side of the highway. At maintamed a level path with the exception of one dip when the witness was still traveling toward it. It dipped toward the ground on one of the swings north of the highway, but came back almost immediately to its original level. As he drove towbrd the light, he expected to find a conventional ex- planation. At that time the light was described as bright and white, but did not hurt his eyes. As he came closer, the light seemed lem brilliant and appeered to pulsate. When he reached the spot where the light was hovering over the road, he stopped his truck in the westbound lane and looked up at the light through the windshield. He then decided to step out and opened the truck door and glanced down a6 he stepped to the ground. On looking up again, he saw the object had swung around 110-130 degrees from almost directly overhead to a position about 1/3 of a mile away to the south souteast. As he stood watching for several minutes, a Chevy Gamer0 passed his truck, slowly, but not stopping. Wanxy then decided to move his truck to the shoulder of the road and did so. Soon after an A&P delivery truck approached from the west. Wanzy tried to flag down the truck, but the driver did not stop. The object continued to hover and he watched it a few more minutes, then got into his truck and proceeded west, driving sldy and watching the lights. After he had traveled for about a half mile, the light suddenly acceler- ated towards the south and was out of sight within a short time. Wanzy drove on for several miles and stopped and called the Tuscola County Sheriff's department. A car was sent to the scene but was unable to locate anything unusual. The following day Wanzy returned to the Sheriff department to assure them he was not crazy and to find out if they had discovered anything. When interviewed by Robert L. Stinson, Wanzy said he was shook up by the sighting and would like to have some explanation for what he had seen. Having served in the Army three years, he was sure the object was not a helicopter or any conventional aircraft. He described the object as diamond or kite-shaped with rounded points with a bright, pulsating white li ht about 2/3 of the way up from the 8 hypothetical base, and centered. his light was framed by a V-shaped ridge of red-orange lights (estinrted 10-20) which glowed or shimmered as if thru a haze. 'here was no noise, no contrail or smoke and no hM effects. His rough estimate set the object as 100-170 feet wide and probably two or three times as long. Mr. Stinson, a State Section Director of MUFON, in reporting this investigation to Walter H. Andrus noted it was puzzling that two other drivers on the road apparently failed to observe the light and report -. it. \"No satisfactory natural explanation has yet emerged t'o explain this sighting,\" he said, \"and it is fairly obvious that it was not a conven- tional aircraft.ll 6"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"WOs Over Ohio Turnpike Kenneth Ray, of 6214 Jackman Rd., and Steve Porter of 2603 Franklin Ave., Toledo, Ohio, said they spotted from one to five UFOs between 8 and 9 p.m. while driving on the Ohio Turnpike between the Indiana line and Toledo, Oct. 19, 1972. \"We weren't drinking either,\" lw. Hay said, in describing the die- play of flashing red and white llghts which moved in the skies. Mr. Porter, who was driving, sald he stopped the car twice and they watched the display--once near the Bryan interchange and akain about 20 miles west of Toledo. There was a bright moon and the skies were clear. \"It started out with one white light, flashing off and on. Then red and white lights appeared to join them, then back off. They moved very fast and then very slow and at one point they were directly over the car,\" Ray said. At one point, the lights turned from dark to light red, with a flash- ing strobe-type light in the middle. Once, the lights seemed to take on a tubular shape, but at another time, in the light of the moon, he could make out a round shape with a dome in the middle,\" Ray said. Porter added, \"They didn't make a sound but moved around pretty fast. They revolved in wide circles all around the sky and we watched them for about 30 minutes altogether.\" Law enforcement agencies and highway patrol turnpike posts in north- western Ohio said they had reports of no unusual sightings by their officers or the public. Robert Beck, chief air traffic controller at Toledo bxpress Airport, said he hed no reports of any UFOs in the area, but added, \"Ever since that television show, \"UFO,\" came on, we've been expecting something like this.\" Beck said high intensity red beacons and lights which blink in sequence on aircraft often are mistzken for something unusual. Adolf Witt, associate professor of astronomy et the University of Toledo, said the atmosphere was extremely clear Thursday ni~ht, and the distance at which aircrzft lights could be seen without heering the sound of engines was unusually great. A Williams County sheriff's deputy said his office usually doesn't take such reports seriously enough to put them in the log. 'We have a rule. If the saucers land and something gets out and shakes hends with our men, they're under orders to bring them into jail.\" he said. Source: Toledo, Ohio, \"The Blade,\" Oct. 20, 1972. Credit: Nils H.

Editor's Comment: 'lhe mens' description of the lights, at one time directly above the car, doesn't sound like \"distant ~ircraft\" and we doubt that. hay and Porter accept that possible eolution. As for the deputy's cute remark, it's typical of the closed-mind attitude of the ignorant toward anything they don't understand. There jist ain't no sich thang. New Jersey Report Patrick D. Clossey, of Paterson, New Jersey, was driving on the Garden State Parkway, at 8:20 a.m. Oct. 9. 1972, when he saw a disc- shaped object through the windshield.

Sgt. Luis Arcadio Lugo and his friend, Louis Ney Barias, an ele- mentary school teacher, said that on Wednesday they saw the unknown object while it was slowly descending behind some bushes just a few meters away from them. An elderly lady, about 70 years old, Encarnacion Lara, also claims to have seen the same object and'that the object, which she described as v,ery similar to a wsaucer* landed in the vicinity of her backyard. The ob ect was apparently seen by dozens of people in the location of Fundo ! at Bani), according to press information and police reports. According to witnesses the object was sending out an intermittant green light. It flew around for about three minutes and then began a slow descent, changing then to a very intense red light. The whole operation lasted only a few minutes, then the object ascended, quickly getting lost in space, according to the witness1 statements. This sighting is reported to be the most concrete case of UFOs so far in this country which during the past few weeks, witnesses have reported hundreds of sightings of flying objects.

Rmdio~ctive \"Foot Prints* Pound in Norwav In the middle of June, this ye;r, Mr. Ola Dahl from Bangsund dis- covered a number of strange prints in the ground round the island of Kjolsoya, where he and 4 others have week-end cottages. There are no other buildings on the island. The prints, being oiostly triangular - a few being round, however - are approximately 2 meters large. A laboratory examination has proved that the prints are radio- active, and the fact that they are weak - a fair distance beyond the noise limit - is due to the time passed from the prints were made, till they were measured. A week before the prints were discovered, enormous disturbances occurred on the TV-casts to aangsund, whereas the TV station at Namsos, placed farther away, did not notice anything. The Norwegian press says that whatever made the prints did not come by land or sea, and the question is whether it came by air!

Co., in Quincy, Ill., observed a cluster of blue lights in a V-formation from his home at 12:50 a.ni.CDST, Oct. 3, 1972 and reported the sighting to halter H. Andrus, MUFON Director. The night was clear with stars shining brightly. The cluster of lights came out of the north, passing directly over the observer, and disappear- ing in the south, all in less than 13 seconds. As the lights were over- head, two appeared to change formation and overlap a third. As they moved to the south, they returned to their original position, but two later broke away, one moving west and the other southwest. There was no sound and the light blue lights did not change in color or intensity--each was larger than any star in the sky, Baldwin said. khen the two appeared to overlap, the shape of -the object could be dis- tin~uished s triangular. A check indicated no aircraft were reported in the area at thet time and the speed of the moving lights would eliminate the possiblity of the \"overlap\" being Air Force fighters refueling. An account of the incident appeared in the Uct. 8 issue of the Quincy \"Herald-khig.\" Older UFO Report from Illinois After seeing and hearing John Schuessler on the Bill Fields Show, St. Louis TV, Channel 11, Mrs. Lucy Hampton, of Lt.

Brill No. 15 The following is a re ort of the sighting of a UFO over Sofia, Bul- % garia on November 21, 19 7. This report is made up of excerpts from \"Trudw November 22nd, \"Narodna Mladezh\" November 24th and the November 23rd news release of the wBulgarian Telegrcph Agency.\" PUZZLE IN THE SKY OVER SOFIA Yesterday's nightfall (November 21st) brought something very unus- ual to the day to day living of our Capital's citizens. The sun wes just setting behind the Lyulin Mountain. Curious people had gathered in groups in the streets and squares watching an enormous luminous object high above the city, almost bt the zenith. With the naked eye, it was easily seen, but its shape was difficult to defino without the aid of binoculars or a telescope. According to the eye-witnesses accounts, when it was first noticed it appe~red as a luminous sphere much larger than the sun's disc and later appeared as a shape similar to a trapezoid. The general interest ; about this appearence was brought on by the fact that the object appear- ed to fly slowly in a .definite predetermined direction. Despite this slowness, the observers could not easily describe its shape. It remained stitionary as if suspended above the city for some time and had the color of the flame of an oxygen welding torch. Fifteen minutes later, through the eyepiece of the \"Lunetan teles- cope which was at the disposal of the workers at the newspaper \"TrudR (magnification 40x1 this object had the appearance of an open parachute near the horizon of the darkening sky. Its upper section formed a com- plete, flat disc encircled by a large, clear band of light. At the tir.e of this observation the telescope read 25 to 30 degrees above the horizon. In its upper section where was a dark disc around which a strange halo was formed, which gave off a bright green phosphorescent bright- ness and appeared to have glittering edges. One could see distinctly how this \"perachute\" suddenly began to shine with a silverish-blue light which quickly changed taking on an orange color. Before it completely disappeared from view it appesred as a small dark orange or red spot of light moving away to the southeast horizon. The object in question was photographed st 5:10 p.m. by the reported- photographer for the \"TrudW newspsper, Luben Donov. It wss also photo- graphed by another citizen of Sofia. An engineer by the name of Chirsto : Tsankov. He took three photographs of it. The first was taken at 5:20 p.m. and the last at 5:35 p.m. This would point out Chat this object was visible for at least twenty- . five minutes over Sofia. Immediately sfter this sighting the editors of \"Trudn called the Ins- titute of Hydrogology and Meteorology and talked with one of the research- ers there. Mr. Dimiter Simetchiev, who observed this extraordinary phenofiena himself, told Chem: The appearance of this bright flying ob- ject above Sofia is certainly extraordln~ry and interesting. I was ob- serving this flying object with the naked eye and for that reason I can not give you any exhaustive information. At this moment, it is pract- ically impossible to identify this object. However, we have established a very important point. This object, whatever it was, was flying com- pletely against the wind current, which can have only one meaning. That is, it must h~ve had its own power source. Our attention was equally attracted by a second peculierity. During the time of flight, the object ' (Continued on next page) 13"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"had absolutely no effect on our radar and caused no television or radio interference. Naturally all aspects of the appearance of this object will be examined according to what various services in our coun- try observed it.\" Another expert at the Academy of Science of Bulgaria was contacted. This was Professor Bogomil hovatchev, Secretary of the Bulgarian Astro- nomical Society, who said: \"This object was at an altitute of thirty kilometers (18 miles). Above all, I would like to emphasize that the UFO observed above our capital was absolutely not an artificial earth satellite. At times this mysterious object travelled much faster than a Sputnik and the light it emitted was much too bright for a satellite. Besides this, we know perfectly well all the satellites which orbit around our planet. We observe their orbits and we keep track of them at all times. It is a known fact that these artifical satellites are barely visible because tiley travel at such grest altitudes and as I previously stated, this object observed over our capital was at an alt- itude of only thirty kilometers above the surface of the earth. The color changes of its radiance could possibly be explained by the effect of the setting sun.\" Lastly. Dr. Felix Y. Zigel, a professor ct the Moscow Aviation Ins- titute was asked, to conmen< on this appearance above Sofia. This was his conunent to the BTA: \"The object mentioned in the Bulgarian newspapere is a typical reprdsentative of what are called UFO 's, that is, Uni- dentified Flying Objects. There are many such observations of this kind, even in our country. Observations of discs as well es other forms, in particular objects which have the appearance of crosses. There are many puzzling points about the behavior and-the nature of these objects. wUnfortunstely, the observations of UFO's with the aid of telescopes and cameras do not occur too often. One could say that the case at hand, the Bulgarian specialist was very lucky. More than once, UFO's have been located by radar, but no one yet has succeeded in obtaining the spectrum of the UFO phenomena, which would beyond a doubt shed some light on their true ori in.\" On November 24th, 19 % 7 the publication \"Narodna Mladezhw in Sofia stated thst this object observed on November 21st was \"a balloon, most probably a meteorological balloon.\" How they arrived at this conclusion was not stated. It was simply stated that this is what it was. A simple statement for the simple minded, but 1 would guess that most of the people that witnessed this observation did not accept that conclusion and are probably still wondering toway what they observed that November 21, 1967 over Sofia.

Again, some of these reports have come through indirect sources, and therefore are difficult to trace. However, I believe they are important enough to be recorded for possible future value. July 9, 1967 - Koman living in Wzshington, D. C. reported a low fly- ing UFO which nearly ranmed her house. She said the object flew on a horizontal course, just barely missing her house and the chimney of her neighbor's house. The object then shot off into the distance. Time: Between sundown and midnight. Durat,ion: less than a minute. 1969 - Three men saw a high flying UFO from a shopping center park- ing lot in the Fresh Pond section of Cambridge, Mass. They said that the object looked like a shiny shooting star but the UFb stopped, moved sideways, stopped akain and then shot straight up and disappeered. July or August 1957 - Dozens of witnesses in Chaumont, France, saw a triangular-shaped UFO flying hi@.h overhead. According to one of the original witnesses, Joseph Boucher, the object was observed sometime between 5:30 and 7:00 p.m. Hc said thst the object brought attention to itself by a high whistling sound emitted as it was flying over. The UFO was at a very great altitude and flying very fast in a straight line. Althou~h the object was at high altitude, the witnesses could discern the shape as thet of a perfect equilateral triangle. Duration of the sighting was 20 to 25 seconds. Other witnesses included Mr. Boucherls father, a major in the Army at thst time, motk.er, sister, brother, two friends, and many neighbors. Pi. Boucher also 'stressed the sudden disappearence of the object at exceptionally ,, high speed which was unlike anything he had ever seen. lhere was no mention of a trail behind the object. July 22, 1972 - Woman reported a large, spherical UFO with red and white lights over Dorchester, Mass. She said thst the UFO w2s traveling from west to east at approximately the speed of a jetliner. At one point the object wes about 100 yards away and she compered the UFO to the moon, only twice as big. The red end white lights were located on the top and bottom of the object. August 1972 - Two young e.irls in their early teens were at Roberts Field in Dorchester, Mass., one night during August. At about 9:30 p.m. they were st~rtled by the appeerence of a bright, white globe low over Dorehester High School. They watched for about 10 seconds as the UFO moved away from the school at about the speed of e small plane. The girls fled the scene due to fright and didnot see the object disappear. Oct. 9, 1972 - Crew of a freight trein saw a round, orange UFO while traveling through Dover, New hampshire.

The re- sults of a recent Gallup Poll concerning life on other planets is also contained in Dec. FATE. And, finally, the letters section of this issue of FATE includes a report of UFOs, their occupants and \"creatures,\" which make very intriguing reading. Speaking of FATE, I recently asked the editor, Eviary Margaret Fuller, if she would be interested in seeing some articles I had in mind, all pertaining to some a'spect of the UFO subject. She replied that, becase of the lack of public interest in UFOs at present, FATE did not intend to carry much information on the subject. I feel this attitude is based on a totally false premise (i.e. the supposed \"lack of public interest in UFOsn) and I wonder if the SKYLOOK readers feel the same? FATE has long been an excellent source of UFO information. It w~s the first magazine to c&rry Kenneth Arnold's complete account of his 1947 \"flying saucersn sighting. If you feel ;s I do, why not drop a line to FATE (500 Hyacinth Place - Highland Pbrk, Ill. 60035) and let them know your thoughts on the matter. What do you think of the many \"contecteew stories? Are they just so much bunk or might there be some truth in them? One man, the late John W.

The results of his 1 labors may be found in FLYLNG SAUCEHS CLOSEUP (Saucerian Publications, Box 2228, Clarksburg, WV 26301 - $7.95). It seems to me the task Dean . set for himself--trying to make all the contactee information \"fit'' was a houeless one. Hokever, no one can Sail to appreciate his dedication to his work.

To the Earth's Interior\" is quoted as stating the horthern Lights are caused by our central sun shining out through the opening at the North Pole.Gardner believes the earth is a hollow body with an immense open- ing at each polar axis and in the center of the earth is a sun which wsrrns it and ~ives it light. Remember, GARDNEH makes thst claim, not this ufozine. . . .From the earth to the moon--in korocco, peasants told kashington Post correspondent Henry Aubin they thought the Apollo landings were Hollywood fakes. Ihere have now been five lsndings on the moon and the crew of Apollo 17 looks forwird to the sixth. . . last month we czrried a story of an Illinois man hit by a meteorite, and Lou Parish tells us the first \"officialw record of a person being hit by one was in Sylacauga, Alabama in 1953. . . he do enjoy the UFO cartoons and got a chuckle out of this one sent in by Capt. Dave Ozanne, clipped from theffllallas limes Herald1':-- Two little space men are looking at a gas station pump nere on earth. One says: \"He won't say aword. Just stands there with that thing in his ear.\" And we like this one: an airplane flies over a tribe of savages. Says one: \"Swamp gas.\" . . . . Again, we sincerely thank every one who sends in the cartoons, newspaper cli pin s etc. We can't get them SKYLOOK, LOOK, but each is appreciated by +'e &. 18"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"ARE YCU HOVING?
