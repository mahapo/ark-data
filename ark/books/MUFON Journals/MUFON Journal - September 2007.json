Close to 500 attendees gathered at the Denver Tech Center Marriott in Denver, Colorado, to hear the excellent presentations by our stellar panel of speakers. The local news media also showed up in force to interview speakers, attendees and to view firsthand the McMinnville, Oregon photo display. Some exciting new information was presented at the Symposium that may be of interest to you—Brad Sparks delivered a riveting talk on MJ12 that is the feature article in this issue of the Journal. Michael Nelson reported on his reinvestigation of the 1966 Portage, Ohio, UFO case and his discov- ery of physical evidence that could conclusively prove that the Portage law enforcement officers were chasing more than just the planet Venus. We will cover Michael’s investigation in the next issue of the Journal. Two MUFON Awards for Excellence in Ufology were presented: one posthu- mously to well known UFO researcher Bob Pratt, accepted by his widow Faith Pratt and son Alan Pratt, and the other pre- sented to Stanton Friedman for his many years of positively promoting Ufology. If you missed this landmark event, you should plan on attending next year’s Symposium which will be held in San Jose, California (dates will be announced soon). MUFON Northern California is very excited about hosting the 2008 Sympo- sium and I look forward to working with their planning team. Meeting MUFON’s Research Goal MUFON’s research teams are finally being formed. The History Team will focus on researching the early days of Ufology and Government involvement while the Abduction Team will focus on researching the abduction phenomenon.

Hidden files and tapes of the late Robert V. Pratt, released only in 2007 through the MUFON Pandora Project, reveal that the controversial MJ-12 Eisenhower Briefing was already known and discussed in the 1981-2 files and tapes and used in a fiction novel being drafted by Pratt. This was three years before the apparently hoaxed document showed up in the mailbox of Hollywood producer Jaime Shandera in 1984. Pratt secretly tape-recorded his meetings and phone conversations with Roswell investigator, William L. Moore, (as he did with many others like Donald Keyhoe) and he compiled documents and memos not available anywhere else. The MJ-12 Eisenhower Briefing is directly linked to the “Project Aquarius” hoax which claims Jesus Christ was an ET alien and talks about alleged investigations and supposed recovery of alien spacecraft and alien bodies at Roswell, New Mexico. We now learn for the first time that it was the supposed MJ-12 that had declared that the Jesus-alien connection needed to be kept “Top Secret” under Project Aquarius to prevent “crippling” of world governments and “severe damage” to Western civilization. Aquarius, Christ and MJ-12 are now all linked. Fake presidential briefings of 1952 and 1977 are now linked, and it is important to keep those dates, 1952 and 1977, in mind as you read along as they keep coming up again and again in this long-running hoax. The Roswell investigation work by nuclear physicist Stanton T. Friedman and William Moore in the early 1980s was leaked wholesale by Moore himself to the U.S. government (as he told me he was doing at the time 1 ) which then turned around and regurgitated the info back to them and/or others in distorted form in false stories and fake documents. This official “disinformation” circulated within ufology to create discord and confusion. It was a disinformation feedback loop. Sometimes the disinformation feedback loop works in our favor. The MJ-12 hoaxers accidentally incorporated mistaken information from Moore and Friedman into their documents, which mistake thus proves MJ-12 is a hoax. The Eisenhower Briefing wrongly claimed that the Roswell crash site was “approximately” 75 miles from the Roswell base, when in fact it was only 62 miles away (62 would be “approximately” 60 miles not 75 miles so the one word “approximately” does not save MJ-12 from disproof). But this dumbbell error was made because the U.S. Air Force (AF) Office of Special Investigation (AFOSI) hoaxers took it from an error in the original Roswell Incident book, the only place that gave the blundering 75-mile figure, and they did not even realize there was a problem with the mileage. It’s a unique error, like a fingerprint, and can only have come from Moore’s book. AFOSI actually first made contact with Moore in two different cities during his Roswell Incident book promotion tour in September 1980, so AFOSI certainly had copies of the book. The Moore-Friedman investigation of Roswell was steered in the wrong directions or misdirected by the exciting new data in the (fake) MJ-12 documents that were mixed in with the sensational (but bogus) “confirmations” of everything they hoped for. An example of misdirection was in making NASA the scapegoat for the AF by falsely implicating NASA in a massive UFO cover-up so researchers would waste time harassing NASA instead of the AF. From Pratt’s files we now learn that the Aquarius MJ-12 disinformation hoax included a 1952 Aquarius Eisenhower Briefing, and other bogus Presidential briefings and briefing documents. This circa November 1952 Aquarius MJ-12 Eisenhower Briefing revealed to Pratt is apparently one and the same as the November 1952 Eisenhower Briefing document that Shandera received two years later. Moore himself tells how his own info was turned into the fake 1977 Aquarius Carter Briefing document by government agents. Moore observed with his own eyes how info he passed on to AFOSI special agent Richard C. Doty was turned into this forged Carter Briefing. He knew this in April 1983 when he saw that his info given to Doty had been recycled into the fake Carter Briefing foisted on Linda Howe. This was just a few weeks after Moore had obtained a copy and could study in detail how his conversation with Doty in late 1982 had been translated into a forged document and then planted on Howe. Surely Moore could see the same scenario being re-enacted before his very eyes once again in December 1984 with the arrival of the 1952 Eisenhower Briefing in Shandera’s mailbox. The document contained much of the Roswell info that he and Friedman had dredged up in the previous several years and passed on to Doty/AFOSI and it echoed Moore’s own discussions with Pratt and Doty on their fiction novel, which featured a hero character modeled on agent Doty. Doty told Moore in meetings in 1980-1981 that the Presidential NSC UFO project was “ Aquarius, classified T op Secret with access restricted to MJ 12.” As the leading MJ-12 defender Friedman himself cautiously concedes, the Eisenhower Briefing “must” have been the work of an “insider” and he names an “insider” from the 1980s, Richard Doty of AFOSI, not someone from 1952, the date we are supposed to believe is the real date of the document. Clearly Friedman suggests “insider” Doty was involved in “creating” the 1952 Eisenhower document in the 80s. This quote is from Friedman’s latest revised edition of his defense of MJ-12, the book TOP SECRET/MAJIC (2005), and he refers to his two partners in investigating the MJ-12 documents, Bill Moore and Jaime Shandera: Friedman: “Whether the [Eisenhower Briefing] documents are valid or not, they must have been created by an insider , The Secret Pratt Tapes and the Origins of MJ-12 1 Moore meeting with Sparks and Kal Korff, Jan. 17, 1982. Moore repeatedly alludes to his mass UFO and ufologist information transfers to Doty / AFOSI: Moore, MUFON 1989 Symposium MJ-12 statement, slightly edited, MUFON UFO Journal (MUJ), Nov. 1989, pp. 12b, 15b, 16a; Dec. 1989, p. 9a (“one of the many friendly discussions I [Moore] had with Richard Doty”), etc."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"September 2007 4 MUFON UFO Journal Continued on page 6 Pratt Tapes & MJ-12 Continued from page 3 and Jaime and Bill had been having conversations with insiders (including Richard Doty of the OSI ) for years before Jaime got the [Eisenhower Briefing Document] film.” 2 According to Moore and Friedman, their “insider contacts” (apparently Doty and the “Falcon” Colonel) knew in advance about the MJ-12 documents coming to Shandera (on film it turns out rather than on paper copy): 3 Moore-Friedman: “There had been cryptic post cards from inside sources and other communications suggesting something might be forthcoming. Even the [Albuquerque] postmark on the packet containing the film gave some clue that there might be a connection with inside sources.... “Moore’s continuing contacts with inside sources [after receipt of the MJ-12 documents] was another factor. Although none of these individuals would admit to being the party responsible for sending the film to Shandera, it seemed only reasonable to believe that there had to be a tie-in somewhere.” Thus even such pioneer MJ-12 investigators and defenders as Moore and Friedman admit the possibility or likelihood the Eisenhower document is an “official fabrication” (Moore) or “totally fraudulent” (Friedman). Friedman admits in his MJ-12 special report, “It is certainly possible” that the Eisenhower document is “totally fraudulent.” Elsewhere in his TS/MAJIC book Friedman concedes that “the entire roll of film [received by Shandera] could be disinformation or a hoax.” 4 The Pratt files and tapes show how the fiction novel project developed when Moore contacted Pratt about helping write a non- fiction book to convey to the public the startling data that AFOSI agent Doty was supplying. Moore and Pratt brainstormed in taped sessions in July 1982 about creating a “cryptographer” character very much like what Friedman claims for debunker Donald Menzel’s “secret life” – but 4 years before Friedman uncovered Menzel’s secret cryptanalysis background in 1986. The Pratt papers reveal that the Eisenhower Briefing was called the “original Aquarius document,” dating from the Truman- Eisenhower transition in November 1952 (though actually forged in the 1980s). This “original Aquarius document” is described as an alleged briefing of President Truman on the recovery of UFO spacecraft at Roswell and elsewhere. The briefing was then given to Eisenhower at the transition of their administrations, circa November 1952, along with the briefing document. This 1952 Aquarius document was supposedly then revised over the years until it became the Aquarius Carter Briefing allegedly given in 1977, which claimed that Jesus Christ was an alien planted on earth 2,000 years ago, gave various phony project names, etc. Thus the Truman Briefing, the Eisenhower Briefing, and the Carter Briefing are all connected, all part of Project Aquarius and MJ-12, along with the absurd claims about an extraterrestrial Christ. The Pratt papers of 1981 further reveal that MJ-12 or “Magic Twelve” was the name of a committee of 12, and it was also a special access restriction label put on papers, just like the Eisenhower Briefing Document which is stamped with “MAJIC” top and bottom, and lists 12 alleged members, Forrestal, Hillenkoetter, et al. MJ-12 was described in the Pratt papers as a Presidential NSC project (see quotes below), just like the familiar MJ-12. All this is years before Shandera received the actual documents. The MJ-12 documents were supposedly leaks of classified government papers telling about a supersecret UFO control committee “MJ-12,” an alleged panel of government scientists and military officials that investigated flying saucer crashes in the late 1940s beginning with Roswell and which controlled the secret crash evidence. No such “MJ-12” committee or designation has ever been found in indisputably genuine government documents and no activities of such a purported 12-member committee have ever been found in genuine government files, despite unsubstantiated claims to the contrary. No staff assistants to the MJ-12 committee have ever turned up (the alleged MJ-12 committee members themselves were all conveniently dead before the MJ-12 documents showed up in December 1984). Whereas a number of first-hand Roswell witnesses are known, not a single first-hand witness can testify to the alleged 2nd crash described in the MJ-12 EBD, at Texas-Mexico in December 1950. The Pratt files contain early information on the claimed Jesus Christ-MJ-12 connection, coming from AFOSI agent Doty in December 1981, quoted in part below: More details about “Project Aquarius”: The “MJ Twelve” in the classification restriction refers to access by the President, members of the National Security Council, and other individuals designated by this group. The total number of people who have access to the “Aquarius document” is twelve (the “Magic Twelve”). The Aquarius document is about 6\" thick, is compart- mentalized to include separate sections on structural analyses, metallurgical analyses, autopsy reports on recovered aliens, etc. Names, dates, and places are cipher coded with the code key kept under separate classification. President Eisenhower ordered all copies but one “incinerated” during his administration.... The Aquarius Document contains “philosophy” as well as technical data ... behind the need to maintain a “Top Secret” posture for as long as possible with respect to the Aquarius data (A) The events surrounding Jesus Christ and the establishment of the Christian religion were manipulations affected [sic] by beings of an advanced civilization from another world. This was done as part of a sociological experiment of some sort with human beings playing the part of the “guinea pigs”. At least some of the subsequent visitations of UFOs to planet Earth over the past 2,000 years have been for the purpose of monitoring this experiment. 2 Friedman, TS/MAJIC (1996/2005) pp. 138-9, emphasis added. 3 Moore-Friedman, MUFON 1988 Symposium MJ-12 paper, pp. 210, 217. 4 Moore-Shandera MJ-12 Report p. 103; Friedman MJ-12 Report p. 1; Friedman TS/MAJIC (1996/2005) p. 22, emphasis added."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"      5 MUFON UFO Journal September 2007 94 – 0692 July 28, 1995 The Honorable Steven H. Schiff House of Representatives Dear Mr. Schiff: In response to your request, we asked several agencies for their views on the authenticity of the publicly circulated written material referred to as Majestic 12. The origin of this material is unknown, but it is purported to represent highly classified government records explain- ing unidentified flying object recovery procedures and the crash of a disc-shaped aircraft near Roswell, New Mexico, in July 1947. Since the late 1980s, several federal agencies have been contacted by nongovernmental persons and asked to comment on the authenticity of the Majestic 12 material. The agencies contacted include — the Information Security Oversight Office (responsible for oversee- ing the information security programs of all executive branch agencies that create or handle classified national security informa- tion), — the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, Deputy for Security and Investigative Programs, and — the National Archives. These agencies responded to the inquiries by stating that their knowl- edge of Majestic 12 was limited to the written material submitted to them by nongovernmental persons. These agencies added that they found no records in their files relating to Majestic 12. Moreover, the agencies’ overall conclusion concerning the authenticity of the Majestic 12 written material was the same—there is no evidence that the Majestic 12 written material constitutes actual documents originally created in the executive branch. According to the Information Security Oversight Office and the Air Force, the Majestic 12 material should not be treated as if it had ever been actually classified by an executive branch agency or government official. We found nothing in our work that contradicts the conclusions reached by these agencies. We also asked the archivists at the Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower libraries for their views on the authenticity of the Majestic 12 material. The archivists said that over the years they have received several inquiries from the public concerning this material. In their search for related records, including classified intelligence and National Security Council documents, they found nothing that appeared to fit the description of the Majestic 12 material or any references to this particular designation. Lastly, during our review of material received from the public by the Information Security Oversight Office in connection with past Freedom of Information Act requests, we came across a message dated November 17, 1980. The message, which appeared to have been originated by the Operations Division of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), contained the words “MJ Twelve.” We contacted AFOSI to determine the authenticity of the Novem- ber 1980 message. In a letter dated February 28, 1995, the Com- mander, AFOSI, Investigative Operations Center, advised us that a search of AFOSI files failed to disclose any official record copy of the message. The commander also advised us that in connection with an earlier Freedom of Informa- tion Act request, AFOSI had been asked to determine the authenticity of the message. At that time, AFOSI concluded that the message was a forgery. If you have any questions, please contact me on (202) 512-3504. Sincerely yours, Richard Davis Director, National Security Analysis The US General Accounting Office (now called Government Accountability Office) investigated MJ-12 as part of its Roswell investigation and concluded that the MJ-12 documents were “not actual” government documents and noted that AFOSI considered the Aquarius Teletype dated November 17, 1980 to be “a forgery,” in this letter to US Representative Steven H. Schiff, New Mexico. The text of the letter is reproduced below. The Schiff Letter"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"September 2007 6 MUFON UFO Journal Pratt Tapes & MJ-12 Continued from page 4 Continued on page 7 (B) Release of this data to the public would not only severely cripple the ability of the government (indeed any government in the Western world) to effectively govern, but would also severely damage the very fibre [sic] of Western civilization as we know it. Remember all this appears in Pratt’s files 3 years before Shandera received the Eisenhower document and over a year before Moore obtained a copy of the Aquarius Carter Briefing. Moore had been in contact with a mysterious “Falcon,” an AF Colonel, since about September 5, 1980, and had been meeting with the Colonel’s designated “middleman” special agent Doty since September 30, 1980 . 5 The Colonel may have been Doty’s superior in AFOSI, but his identity has never been released by Moore of Friedman or otherwise confirmed. (Years later Moore gave them bird names, the Colonel was the “Falcon” and Doty was the “Sparrow,” though they themselves mixed it up to create confusion.) At that first meeting, Doty outrageously claimed that Friedman and Sparks knew him personally and would vouch for him. Moore immediately phoned both and verified that neither one had ever even heard of Doty before. This would be typical of Doty’s brazen self-contradictions for decades to come. 6 Both Doty and the Colonel were repeatedly caught lying to Moore and Friedman yet the latter continued to maintain contact for years in hopes of obtaining some inside government information on UFOs. 7 Moore chillingly articulates the goals of the AFOSI disinformation program against ufology in his taped sessions with Pratt. Moore is quoted in the full 2007 MUFON Proceedings article along with the official AF regulations that substantiate the use of such disinformation techniques by AFOSI against civilian US citizens and organizations on flimsy pretexts. These AF directives describe such AFOSI operations as seeking to “counter” and “neutralize” supposed adversaries using methods that “influence, disrupt, corrupt or usurp” those they target, including U.S. organizations and individuals. 8 It is not just limited to foreign powers or terrorist groups as many probably assume. SUMMARIES The following are the section headings from the 2007 MUFON Proceedings article with brief summaries under each. See Proceedings article for full details. The “Original Aquarius Document” and the MJ-12 Eisenhower Briefing In the December 29 and 30, 1981, meetings with Moore leading to Moore’s approach to Pratt on writing a book, Doty revealed a vast array of alleged secret information concerning crashed saucers and dead aliens purportedly recovered by the U.S. Government and compiled in the “original Aquarius Document.” Then Moore called Pratt, who flew out to Arizona to meet him on about January 2, 1982, to propose a non-fiction book project. 9 As Pratt later recounted it: “I happened to be in Houston and flew out to Phoenix to visit Bill [Moore] at his request. He wanted to talk to me about something he couldn’t discuss on the phone. He was in bed with a bad back at the time, and as I sat in a chair and took notes he told me about Project Aquarius, MJ-12 and a number of other things.” “PRATT SENSITIVE” Moore proposed the non-fiction book project to Pratt to convey this important alleged information from AFOSI agent Doty to the public. Pratt agreed but insisted on making it a fictional novel as that would lessen the difficulties in cross-checking and documenting material that came from or involved Doty/AFOSI. The Moore-Pratt-Doty book project itself fizzled out in 1983-4 and nothing was published. In a letter to the late Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) UFO researcher Robert Todd, Pratt explained how his title for the book started as MAJIK-12 but was changed by Moore to The Aquarius Project, which was its final title for the unpublished manuscript. 10 Suspicions about the MJ-12 “Eisenhower Briefing Document” and Aquarius This late 1952 alleged “original Aquarius Document” for briefing President Eisenhower appears to be the same as the so- called MJ-12 Eisenhower Briefing Document (EBD) dated November 18, 1952, as mentioned above. This 1952 Aquarius Briefing reportedly transformed by revisions into the 1977 Aquarius Briefing of Carter and perhaps should be called the 1952 Aquarius EBD. 11 5 William L. Moore telecon with Brad Sparks, Sept. 30, 1980, discussing the Doty meeting; Moore interview by Jerome Clark, Nov. 3, 1987, in Clark, UFO Encyclopedia (1998 ed.) vol. 1, p. 304. Moore’s first contact with Doty was when Doty contacted him about Sept. 21, 1980. (Pratt- Moore meeting transcript, July 7-9, 1982, p. 5). Moore evidently first met the Colonel in late Oct. 1980, with Doty present (cf. Greg Bishop, Project Beta , 2005, pp. 63-64, but note Bishop has some dates scrambled and events telescoped; Moore-Shandera MJ-12 Report, July 1990 ed., p. 6). See further discussion later. 6 “Multiple stories were vintage Doty” (Bishop, Project Beta, p. 65). 7 During his book promotion tour for the Roswell Incident book in Sept. 1980, Moore “was approached by various insiders who provided some leads and some legitimate as well as false leads apparently checking on whether we would just swallow the bait,” Friedman admitted (Background Comments/ Roswell-MAJESTIC-12, Aug. 25, 1987, p. 1, emphasis added). Besides such factual falsehoods Doty and the Colonel also “kept making and then breaking promises,” Friedman writes. “Apparently they hooked Shandera and Moore despite their failures to deliver the goods.” (MUFON 1992 Symposium paper, p. 272.) “Falcon” has also been described as a DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) man from Washington, DC, but he could still be a Colonel in AFOSI on assignment to DIA. Linda Howe met with Doty’s “DIA man” in Washington in 1984. Doty told Philip Klass in a taped phone interview on Jan. 8, 1988, that he thought the MJ-12 documents had been forged by the DIA man. Some DIA personnel have later emerged in Moore’s “Aviary,” including Gene Loscowski (aka “Gene Lake”) and Ernest Kellerstrauss. 8 AF Policy Directive (AFPD) 71-1, subsecs. 3 and 7.4.2; AFPD 10-7, paras. 1.2, 2.1, pp. 18, 21; DoD Directive 5240.1R, Procedure 10, sec.

As Friedman writes in his MJ-12 defense book, TOP SECRET/ MAJIC (1996) p. 130, emphasis added: “... the simple fact of the matter is that Moore, Shandera, and I had already picked up on all the names of the [MJ-12] list prior to receipt of the [EBD] film (except for Dr. Donald Menzel) 12 as a result of the many days spent in archival research begun a decade ago.... We had noted who was where in early July 1947, when the Roswell incident occurred.” Thus it should come as no surprise that this list of top scientists and military officers should later resurface in the MJ-12 documents in Shandera’s mailbox postmarked Albuquerque, 13 and strongly suspected to be an AFOSI-Albuquerque (Doty) hoax. Admissions that MJ-12 was “Created” by Government “Insider” Even such pioneer MJ-12 investigators and defenders as Moore and Friedman admit the possibility the EBD is an “official fabrication” or “totally fraudulent.” 14 Friedman, as quoted previously, concedes that the documents “must” have been “created by an insider,” not in the 1950s, but referring to present day “insiders” such as Doty / AFOSI as suspect(s), and almost admitting that MJ-12 is a forgery. 15 The active connection between the alleged Eisenhower Briefing Document and AFOSI 16 is strange and certainly not an innocent or natural connection if the EBD was genuine. The EBD purports to be from 1952, does not claim to be written by AFOSI and makes no mention of AFOSI. Why then would anyone in AFOSI know anything about such an allegedly decades old document if AFOSI is not even in the document or the author or recipient of it? Don’t AFOSI agents have better things to do with current caseloads than go rummaging through ancient historical archives of other agencies? As Friedman ironically admits about a later series of MJ-12 forgeries surfaced by Timothy Cooper, mainly in the 1990s: 17 “In the back of my mind, though, was the nagging suspicion that the [Cooper MJ-12] documents, or at least some of them, might be too good to be true.... It just seemed like too many elements were matching up.” The same argument could be made about the original MJ-12 documents. Fatal Error in the MJ-12 “Eisenhower Briefing Document” Friedman has rightly said that one of the main ways of determining if “the document is phony,” referring to the EBD, is “on the basis of any mistaken information in it,” according to “all the rules of science and journalism.” Moore and Shandera joined him in saying this. Unfortunately they are wrong in concluding the EBD has no “mistaken information” in it, that “there is none,” they flatly declare . 18 The EBD wrongly claims the site is “approximately seventy- five [75] miles northwest of Roswell Army Air Base,” a gross error that Sparks has been pointing out from the start in 1987. 19 The actual distance is 62 miles not 75 miles from Roswell (and in the unlikely case that airmen would use road distance instead of air distance, by road it is over 100 miles, again not 75 miles). 20 In reality, the 75-mile figure was unwittingly taken by the MJ- 12 hoaxer from the erroneous 75-mile figure published in the original 12 See similar quote in Friedman, MUFON 1989 Symposium MJ-12 paper, p. 88. In fact, the Friedman-Moore research was even better than Friedman modestly claimed – they had actually gotten all the MJ-12 names by 1982 including Menzel’s. The one alleged exception, notorious UFO debunker astronomer Menzel, that Friedman claims he did not know about and no one knew about until the EBD surfaced in 1984, was in fact already known by Friedman in 1980. I had long arguments about this with my friend Stan Friedman in person and on the phone locally in California in early 1980 before Stan moved away to Canada in August 1980 (and then we could no longer meet and telephone). Stan had just obtained the newly uncovered 1950 Wilbert Smith memo and decided that Menzel of all people, the anti- UFO archdebunker, must have led the original 1947 Roswell investigation (not mentioned by Smith). We argued over his sudden reversal on Menzel. He based it on facts about Menzel being in New Mexico in the late 1940s on a secret AF contract which I had uncovered, and on the Smith memo (which I pointed out was 3 years later, made no mention of Roswell or 1947, etc.). As Stan wrote in his TS/MAJIC book, that prior to the 1984 MJ-12 documents, “We had noted who was where in early July 1947, when the Roswell incident occurred.” Indeed Stan had insisted to me in 1980, “Menzel was the right scientist, with the right credentials, at the right time, to head up the Roswell investigation in 1947. He had all the right clearances and was right there on the scene in New Mexico.” 13 Partial photocopy of mailing envelope shows a “DEC 9 1984” postmark (not Dec. 8 as is sometimes stated) but the city has been sliced off (Moore- Friedman MJ-12 paper, 1988 MUFON Proceedings, p. 241); Moore-Shandera MJ-12 Report pp. 43 (Albuquerque postmark Dec. 8), 74 (mailed Dec. 9); Friedman TS/MAJIC (1996) pp. 20, 58 (Albuquerque postmark), 138-9. 14 Moore-Shandera MJ-12 Report p. 103; Friedman MJ-12 Report p. 1 (“It is certainly possible” that the EBD is “totally fraudulent”); Friedman TS/MAJIC (1996) p. 22 (“the entire roll of [EBD] film could be disinformation or a hoax”). 15 Friedman, TS/MAJIC (1996/2005) pp. 138-9, emphasis added. 16 Moore-Friedman, MUFON 1988 Symposium MJ-12 paper, pp. 210, 217; Friedman MJ-12 Report p. 1; Friedman TS/MAJIC (1996/2005) p. 20. 17 Friedman, TS/MAJIC (1996/2005) p. 150. 18 Friedman, Comments on CSICOP/Majestic-12, Aug. 26, 1977, p. 3; Moore-Shandera-Friedman, Debunkers Ignore Evidence, Sept. 11, 1987, p. 5; Sept. 15, 1987, Focus, p. 5a. 19 Sparks interview in Jerome Clark article, Omni magazine, Nov. 1987, p. 131b.

Pratt Tapes & MJ-12"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"September 2007 8 MUFON UFO Journal Continued on page 9 Roswell Incident book in 1980 or a later article, the only possible sources for such an error, there being no other figures for the distance given by anyone else and it is not the true distance which is 62 miles. 21 As mentioned earlier, Doty and the Colonel made contact with Moore on the September 1980 Roswell Incident book publicity tour so they no doubt had a copy of the book. 22 MJ-12’s Messy Menzel Mistakes – the Cryptanalysis Conundrum There are still other major errors in the EBD, particularly relating to Harvard astronomer Donald Menzel, but space limitations preclude delving into them in detail here (almost book-length treatment would be required). 23 Briefly, the EBD author clearly did not know of Menzel’s consulting work in cryptanalysis for the Navy (and later the NSA) and his mastering the Japanese script and language which talents would have made him an ideal candidate for analyzing alien writings written with strange symbols. This is shown by the fact the EBD makes no mention of Menzel’s cryptanalysis background or any role by Menzel in attempting to decipher the alien writings allegedly found at Roswell. The EBD merely states: “Efforts to decipher these have remained largely unsuccessful.” But strangely, Friedman seems to think the EBD actually mentions Menzel’s cryptanalysis and NSA background – but cannot seem to quote where it does. Friedman claims “there are many details in the briefing [the EBD] that were not known to any of us on the outside at the time. (See Appendix C.)” Appendix C lists the EBD’s supposed new revelations as including Menzel’s Connections and Talents, such as “association with NSA and predecessor Navy agency” and “Expert cryptanalyst; taught cryptanalysis.” 24 So these Menzel NSA connections and cryptanalysis talents are supposedly “details in the [Eisenhower] briefing” according to Friedman. But no such Menzel codebreaking can be found in the EBD. However, the idea of bringing in a “cryptographer” to analyze alien writings in the Roswell UFO crash was already brought up by Pratt and Moore in their fictional novel MAJIK-12 project two years before the “MAJIC” MJ-12 document showed up. MJ-12 “Liaison” Ruppelt Mad at Menzel for Misappropriating Blue Book Files But this is not the only case of the EBD author not knowing something critically important about Menzel’s background which if known would have forced a change in the document. There is another matter, which goes beyond information presentation, and if known to a real MJ-12 or even to the MJ-12 hoaxer would have forced a change in the very structure of the alleged MJ-12 operations: Ruppelt tried to “push an investigation” of Menzel for violating security in stealing or misappropriating Blue Book files, 25 as Ruppelt’s private papers reveal. Ruppelt said Menzel was a “poor security risk” based on this and that Aiken was equally guilty as he should not have passed on classified Blue Book files “to someone who didn’t even have a clearance.” 26 Yet the EBD claims that Majestic-12 had direct cooperation with Ruppelt, that current liaison is “maintained through the Air Force officer who is head of the [BLUE BOOK] project.” In the EBD there is no hint of any schism or problem between Ruppelt and purported MJ-12 member Menzel. Conversely, nor has any sign of MJ-12 itself ever turned up in any of Ruppelt’s papers or in any AF documents. If MJ-12 had liaison with Blue Book for the very purpose of obtaining Blue Book data (and from its Sign and Grudge Also, a 62-mile figure would be rounded to “approximately” 60 miles, not “approximately” 75 miles, so the “approximately” qualifier does not save the MJ-12 EBD from fatal error. 21 Berlitz-Moore, Roswell Incident (1980) p. 27; Moore, MUFON 1982 Symposium Roswell paper, p. 87. The Moore 1982 paper is endorsed by Friedman who even lists himself as co-author in various later articles (e.g., Friedman, MUFON 1989 Symposium MJ-12 paper, p. 100, References, lists the co-authors: “Moore, W.L. and Friedman, S.T., ‘The Roswell Investigations ...,’ MUFON 1982 UFO Symposium Proceedings, July 1982, pp. 85-104\"). 22 Moore telecon with Sparks, Sept. 30, 1980; Moore interview, Nov. 3, 1987, in Clark, UFO Encyclopedia (1998 ed.) vol. 1, p. 304. Doty contacted Moore about Sept. 21, 1980. (Pratt-Moore meeting transcript, July 7-9, 1982, p. 5, about “three weeks” into the month of Sept. 1980). “Falcon” appointed Doty his “liaison” or “middle-man” with Moore. (Moore-Shandera MJ-12 Report, pp. 4, 6; Moore, MUFON 1989 Symposium MJ-12 statement, MUJ, Nov. 1989, pp. 12b-13b.) Moore started using his “Falcon” and “Sparrow” designations only in 1984 so his use of the avian labels in recounting earlier events, in 1980-2 is merely in retrospect (Moore, MUFON 1989 MJ-12 statement, MUJ, Nov. 1989, p. 12c). Robert Hastings (MJ-12 Report 1989, p. 1) states that Linda Howe told him Doty applied the “Falcon” label to himself at their April 9, 1983, meeting, however her account of this comes from ca. early 1989 and may be contaminated by later events and labeling. Moore claims “Neither ‘Sparrow’ nor ‘Falcon’ were aware that we were using these terms in reference to them, nor was anyone else to the best of my knowledge, prior to about mid-1985\" (Moore, MUFON 1989 MJ-12 statement, MUJ, Nov. 1989, p. 12c). Moore apparently got the idea for the “aviary” cover names from his reading the book The Falcon and the Snowman, on the TRW / CIA spies Boyce and Lee, which in this time period Moore told Sparks he was reading. 23 A favorite pastime of defenders and critics of MJ-12 documents has been the formatting, typefaces, styles, signatures, control numbers (or lack of same) and markings of the documents, none of which has proved to be conclusive in determining authenticity or fraud except in rare cases. However it is interesting that in the 20 years since the MJ-12 EBD went public, not a single example of the Zero-Digit Month-Comma date style , called by Moore and Shandera Style (k) as seen in 01 August, 1950, 07 July, 1947, and 06 December, 1950, in the EBD (Moore-Shandera MJ-12 Report, p. 58) has ever been found in a genuine government document or anything written by supposed MJ-1 Admiral Hillenkoetter. Only partial styles, either the Zero-Digit or the Month-Comma have been found, but never both together . 24 Compare Friedman, TS/MAJIC, pp. 67 and 233, emphasis added. 25 Apparently many Blue Book papers were outright stolen by Menzel and Aiken and never returned. Battelle Memorial Institute noted that “many of our forms” evaluating UFO cases in the Blue Book files were never returned from Harvard, they were “lost.” This resulted in about a 2-month delay in Battelle’s statistical analysis of UFO cases. (Battelle Project Stork Supv. W illiam T. Reid letter to Miles E. Goll, ATIC, Jan. 23, 1953.) Pratt Tapes & MJ-12 Continued from page 7"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"      9 MUFON UFO Journal September 2007 Continued on page 10 Pratt Tapes & MJ-12 Continued from page 7 predecessors as well) why would an important alleged MJ-12 committee member such as Menzel need to steal Blue Book’s files and risk creating a security problem for MJ-12 in the resulting uproar if exposed (as it was)? Why did Menzel even need to ask Blue Book for its files in the first place when he should have had MJ- 12’s back copies of Blue Book files already? No need for Menzel to bother contacting Blue Book and risk MJ-12 security. The very purpose of the alleged MJ-12 liaison with Blue Book was to satisfy MJ-12’s “need for as much additional information as possible” about UFOs and it was assertedly a long- standing liaison relationship going back five years. Blue Book’s files were “additional information.” Didn’t MJ-12 already then have copies of all of Blue Book’s files and of its predecessors for the past five years? Well the most logical and reasonable answer is that MJ-12 did not and does not exist, it is a fictional construct of 1980s disinformation, and therefore, Menzel in 1952 had no way to access nonexistent copies of Blue Book case files held by a nonexistent MJ-12 committee which he of course knew nothing about because it was and is nonexistent, a figment of the imagination of future deception officers of the Air Force. Moore’s Example of Doty’s Document Faking with Data from Moore (Aquarius) Bill Moore describes how information he passed on to Doty was shortly afterward used to fabricate the Aquarius Executive Briefing of Carter, which cites the Aztec crash as legitimate, and was shown to Linda Howe by Doty on April 9, 1983. 27 Moore’s candid description of how his information given to Doty was within months turned into a fake document, the Aquarius Carter Briefing, planted on another ufologist, is an important and useful model for understanding the AFOSI disinformation methodology as carried out by Doty the “Sparrow,” the “Falcon” Colonel and their AFOSI counterintelligence cohorts. Notice that the relationship between Bennewitz and Howe was viewed by AFOSI in terms of how to “influence others” (see full Moore quote). It was not about collecting information or spying on ufologists. They collected information only for the purpose of twisting it into disinformation to “influence others.” We will see later that AF regulations explain the purpose of “Influence Operations” as the defeat of AF adversaries and that these adversaries are not at all limited to foreign powers but can be law- abiding U.S. citizens and organizations as well. The AFOSI Disinformation and Destabilization of Bennewitz Moore also described how Bennewitz was to be publicly discredited: 28 “... Bennewitz was expected to wave it [the one-page Aquarius Teletype] to the press and others as proof of what he was saying about an alien invasion, at which point the document would be denounced as a counterfeit and Bennewitz would be further discredited.” “I was personally aware of the intelligence community’s concerted efforts to systematically confuse, discourage and discredit Paul by providing him with a large body of disinformation on the subject of UFOs, the malevolent aliens who allegedly pilot them, the technology they employ and the underground bases they supposedly possess and occupy.” There is little doubt that Bennewitz was being personally visited by Doty, as Bennewitz phoned, then wrote to Capt. Harris in AF Intelligence at the Pentagon on December 2, 1981, with an impressive list of officials supposedly backing his claims of alien contact including two generals and: “SA [Special Agent] Rick Doty - Kirtland AFB, Albuquerque, NM - phone Autovon 2442911 “I have passed numerous data through Mr. Doty for his routing – he has seen the tracking ground station, witnessed and used computer communications, and initially determined the validity of what I am doing.” In July 1979 Bennewitz began taking movie film of lights in the sky and recording alleged radio emanations (but not messages) from UFOs, which he claimed he could “D.F.” (direction-find) to prove that he was tracking UFOs up to 60 miles distance. 29 In August 1979, there was an informal convocation of ufologists from around the country that converged on Albuquerque to meet with a Japanese television crew from Nippon TV, and to meet among themselves. Bennewitz networked with other ufologists and cattle mutilation researchers, and almost certainly came to the attention of talent spotters in AFOSI counterintelligence at this time. They no doubt assessed him as especially susceptible to discreditable UFO storytelling but also as an effective promoter and networker who could spread the crazy stories to influential figures in the fringes of ufology. Soon thereafter the “alien” messages began. Bennewitz claimed that on January 27, 1980, he received his first radio communication from the aliens. This was, he asserted, shortly after the U.S. armed forces fought a battle with the aliens at the underground “alien US base” near Archuleta Peak, some 4.5 miles northwest of Dulce, NM. He claimed that an AF security officer was even present at this historic “milestone,” giving him guidance, the Commander of Kirtland AFB/Manzano Base’s 1608th Security Police Squadron, Major Ernest Edwards. Bennewitz told AF Intelligence by letter: 30 26 Ruppelt memo on Menzel, 7 pp., undated (1955), Ruppelt papers. 27 Moore, MUFON 1989 MJ-12 statement, MUJ, Dec, 1989, p. 9, emphasis added. In Bishop’s later interviews of Doty on Oct. 8, 2003, and Moore throughout 2003, Doty was described as “grilling” Moore for his Aztec investigation details (Bishop, Project Beta, pp. 81, 206). 28 Moore, MUFON 1989 MJ-12 statement, MUJ, Dec, 1989, p. 11a; Nov. 1989, p. 15. 29 Bennewitz’s “physicist” background is strange in light of the physics nonsense he was spewing. Bishop found reason to question Bennewitz’s competence as an “electrical physicist” ( Project Beta, p. 23). See 2007 MUFON Proceedings for technical examples. 30 Bennewitz letter to Capt. Harris, ACSI, Dec. 2, 1981, p. 1. This “milestone” event supposedly witnessed by Maj. Edwards is nowhere mentioned in Bishop’s book and the date frame around Jan. 1980 is a blank"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"September 2007 10 MUFON UFO Journal Pratt Tapes & MJ-12 Continued from page 9 “Major Edwards has witnessed closely all events throughout including establishment of the first communications with the Alien since Jan. 27, 1980. He has unofficially provided valuable logistic judgment as the Project progressed.” This historic event would actually be AFOSI beginning its beaming of crackpot “alien” messages to Bennewitz, perhaps from the townhouse across the street or perhaps from the base. (Bennewitz lived close to the base fence. 31 ) The stories fed to Bennewitz grew crazier and more complex until the whole scenario recited above by Moore was fully developed, including the fake Project Aquarius run by NASA according to Bennewitz (and according to Doty who said the same thing). The Plot of the Moore-Pratt-Doty Book “The Aquarius Project/ MAJIK-12” Pratt explained the history of his book project with Moore and Doty in a February 20, 1989, letter to the late Robert Todd, a government document researcher in Ardmore, Pennsylvania. Part of it was the infamous Ellsworth hoax. In 1990, Moore and Shandera concluded that the Ellsworth Document was “officially fabricated as part of a government counterintelligence/ disinformation operation” and “clearly associated with either AFOSI Detachment 1302, the 44th Security Policy Group [sic], or one of three people from Washington, D.C. ... involved with a counterintelligence/ disinformation training exercise being conducted at Ellsworth AFB during late 1977 and early 1978.” It was supposedly designed to plug a security leak at the base. They say that Doty admitted to them that he was “aware” of the disinformation operation but was only “peripherally involved” and had nothing to do with fabricating the document sent to the National Enquirer. They also claim that it was at this time that Doty’s name came to the attention of a “shadowy figure in Washington” later known as the “Falcon.” 32 Moore’s Investigations of Doty Moore apparently had a lot of misgivings and even outright suspicions of Doty, which he alluded to in these conversations with Pratt. Even while collaborating with Doty, Moore was also investigating Doty, noting a lot of personal data on Doty, height, weight, appearance, etc. This is hardly the behavior one would expect from someone willingly conspiring in a hoax with Doty, as Moore is sometimes accused of doing. 33 Doty’s Aquarius MJ-12 Revelations in 1981 At the January 1982 meeting, Moore gave Pratt several lengthy memos of his many conversations with Doty plus some copies of documents supplied by Doty. One 10-page Moore memo with numbered paragraphs was typed October 18, 1981, and revised by Moore by hand on or just before the date of his Pratt meeting. 34 This was supplemented with a 5-page memo with numbered paragraphs and addendum, all concerning Moore’s two recent meetings with Doty, and dated January 2, 1982. Numerous other subjects of sensational interest originating with Doty and seemingly designed to attract the attention of UFO researchers such as Moore and Pratt, are covered at varying length in the Moore-Pratt material. This represents the results of the first year or so of Moore’s contacts with Doty (and the AF Colonel): – Roswell (Doty’s interview of the FBI agent Percy Wyly, etc.) – Socorro - Lonnie Zamora case (alleged radar trackings and new witnesses) – Cash-Landrum case (alleged NASA-USAF nuclear vehicle) – Wilbert Smith memo – MIB – Alleged wiretapping of Moore’s and Doty’s own phones And there are various purported crashed saucer stories, etc. Spurious accusations against various UFO groups and researchers such as MUFON’s John Schuessler, APRO’s Jim Lorenzen and Robert Todd are spun out falsely accusing them of hoaxing or being “CIA agents” or even AFOSI spies in an effort to discredit them. Doty calls James Oberg an unwitting debunking agent. Doty (via Moore) names various seemingly phony classified “project” codenames apparently concocted to get UFO researchers to waste their time and energies pursuing fruitless FOIA requests on nonexistent or deliberately misidentified “projects.” Most codenames were not heard of before and not seen again. in his chronology (cf. Project Beta, p. 14, no mention). Bishop does not explain this omission. 31 Bishop, Project Beta, p. 2. 32 Moore-Shandera MJ-12 Report, pp. 2-6. Ellsworth Document was a disinformation training exercise according to Bishop ( Project Beta, p. 80). Various Doty claims on the Ellsworth incident (ibid. pp. 79-80, 204). 33 Doty’s independence from Moore to the point of subverting, undermining and opposing Moore, argues against them being co-conspirators. Doty leaked the MJ-12 EBD through an intermediary to Tim Good in the UK when Moore would not publicize it, forcing Moore to grudgingly release it in stages in April-May 1987. Doty and the “Falcon” Colonel included the Zechel’s Texas-Mexican crash in the EBD, which Moore would never have done after his falling out with Zechel in 1980. Clearly Doty and the Colonel did not coordinate the contents of the EBD with Moore. And if Moore had hoaxed the EBD he could have avoided including Zechel’s December 1950 Texas-Mexico case by just dating the purported Presidential briefing prior to December 1950. No need to date it in 1952. It could have been say, a 1949 or early 1950 “TBD” Truman Briefing Document. 34 Assuming the date on Moore’s memo, Jan. 2, 1982, was also the date he met with Pratt, though the meeting might have been a day or two later.

Ringer This article is continued from last month. For a long time now, hypnosis has been used to recover hidden memory and to (from the standpoint of the investigator in particular) determine the facts behind the disturbing thoughts and feelings. While the results of such hypnotic probing are often dramatic, some question whether hypnosis is a proper tool, especially when the investigator is not a trained therapist. One often-cited objection to the use of hypnosis is the possibility of recovering false memories in the process. Another potential problem, which seems quite likely when an amateur is involved, is the use of leading questions. Then, there is the pure inventiveness of the mind. In an interesting experiment, ordinary folks were placed under hypnosis and then asked to describe an alien abduction experience. While there were important, qualitative differences, the resulting stories were quite vivid. Apparently even individuals who have no interest or experience with UFOs can muster up a compelling tale. These are valid reasons for a cautious approach. But, once out of the bottle, it’s very difficult to put the genie back inside. Hypnosis will continue to be used, and the best we can do is to insist on qualified hypnotists who follow valid procedures. Nick Pope’s web site 8 has a commentary on alien abductions and hypnosis. The (British) National Council for Hypnotherapy (NCH) issued a policy statement concerning alien abductions on December 14, 2001. It says, in part: Alien Abduction Clients (AAC) are to be treated with the same respect and courtesy as any other client. Regression techniques that should be utilized with AACs should follow these guidelines: a. Non Directive, b. Non Leading, c. Preferably Indirect. The therapist must also be aware of the implications of False Memory Syndrome (FMS). We recommend that therapists should not introduce the subject of Alien Abduc- tions unless the client refers to it in the first instance. Additionally, therapists should not engage in corroborating these incidents. Therapists should take a neutral stance on the existence of alien abductions. 8 Nick Pope states that the 1987 moratorium on regression hypnosis by the British UFO Research Association, while well-intentioned at the time, now looks somewhat quaint. He adds that more and more British abductees are seeking to undergo regression hypnosis. Abductees are victims first Our brains and the memories con- tained within (so we theorize) is exceedingly complex. This fact alone should give us caution when thinking about and generalizing from the stories of those describing what seem to be abductions by non-humans. Are they trauma victims? It seems certain most are, and yet we must treat the events they remember with a mix of compas- sion and detachment. They are victims of trauma first and sources of informa- tion only secondarily. Some, including our harshest critics, have called the aliens we envision and their marvelous flying craft the “myth” of our times. Certainly, every era had its myths, and those fables were right for their times. While our myth seems disturbingly real, it’s hard to escape the parallels. Scientists have long ceded the mysteries of the soul to theologians and philosophers. Perhaps we should assign to our minds a similar elusive quality. Jane Austin, in her book Mansfield Park , had this to say. If any one faculty of our nature may be called more wonderful than the rest, I do think it is memory. There seems something more speak-ingly incompre- hensible in the powers, the failures, the inequalities of memory, than in any other of our intelligences. The memory is sometimes so retentive, so service- able, so obedient; at others, so bewil- dered and so weak; and at others again, so tyrannic, so beyond control! We are, to be sure, a miracle every way; but our powers of recollecting and of forgetting do seem peculiarly past finding out. Bibliography www.nickpope.net/alien_abduction_ and_hypnosis.htm.

Carey and Donald R. Schmitt. Career Press, New Page Books, 2007. 256 pages. Reviewed by Stanton Friedman Little did I know almost 20 years ago when Don Schmitt asked me after a college lecture if I thought that there was more research to be done about the Roswell Incident, that we would both still be at it two decades later. My response was that I thought there was a great deal more to do, but that I frankly couldn’t afford to do it. First Don teamed with Kevin Randle under the auspices of CUFOS. That produced UFO Crash at Roswell and The Truth about the UFO Crash at Roswell . After they split, Don has spent a lot of effort with Tom Carey to fill out the Roswell story. Their important new book Witness to Roswell, was one of at least four new Roswell-related books available at the 60 th Anniversary Roswell festival. One was Mexico’s Roswell by Noe Torres and Ruben Uriarte about a case that happened near Chihuahua on August 25, 1974. (I wrote the afterword.) A second was The Best of Roswell published by Fate Magazine which contains Roswell- related articles Fate has published... a kind of blast from the past. The third is The Legacy of Roswell by Dr. Jesse Marcel. I also wrote the foreword for this very significant book. Jesse—who as an 11-year-old held pieces of wreckage, and who recently spent 13 months in Iraq beginning at age 68 as an army colonel, flight surgeon, helicopter pilot (225 combat flying hours)—tells his family story well. The subtitle to the Carey-Schmitt book is very appropriate: Unmasking the 60-year Cover-up . They have made many trips to New Mexico and have found many new witnesses. There are two major new developments. One is the focus on a crash site only 40 miles north of Roswell at which an almost intact saucer and bodies were located by local youth. The big shocker contained in the book is a 2002 affidavit by Walter Haut which he wrote to be released after his death. He died in December 2005. Walter supposedly had himself seen a strange body and wreckage at the base and been at the site, but kept his word to Colonel Blanchard, base commander and a friend, never to talk about it. In the past, Walter, who had issued the famous press release announcing the recovery of a crashed flying saucer on July 8, 1947, had always maintained that he hadn’t seen anything, but was convinced that what was recovered was a UFO and certainly not a weather balloon. Having been the first investigator to locate Walter back before 1980, and having met with him many times, I would certainly describe Walter as a very honest, helpful, cordial and decent person. He was very well thought of in town. There is certainly not the slightest chance that he was lying , though age and many interviews may have affected his memory. He does give some surprising details, especially that Fort Worth based General Roger Ramey and Colonel Dubose had been at the 7:30 AM meeting at the base on July 8,1947, with Jesse Marcel, Haut, Blanchard and others, and that various strange materials had been handed all around. There was talk of the close-in more recent crash. We know that Jesse had been flown over to Fort Worth that afternoon with wreckage from the Brazel ranch site and that pictures were taken of Ramey, Dubose and Marcel in Ramey’s office. Thus, if the account is true, Jesse would have known about bodies as well, though he never said so to me or to Jesse Junior. I met twice with DuBose in Florida. The second time was with Don when we filmed him for the FUFOR’s Recollections of Roswell documentary. In our last conversation he told me he liked what I was doing and, if he remembered anything else, he would tell me, “What can they do to me now?” (He was then in his mid 80’s). There was no hint of a Roswell meeting. He did speak openly about a call from Ramey’s boss, General McMullen. Thus, I am puzzled that neither he nor Jesse Sr. spoke of the Roswell meeting. The three-page affidavit from Haut is presented without comment. It raises many questions. A notary certified the signature. But there is no information as to the ci r cumstances such as who actually wrote it. Was it handwritten? Had it been dictated and then typed? Did somebody ask a bunch of questions and combine the answers? Equally important, is there any evidence to prove that Ramey and DuBose had been in Roswell at the time? I, for example, was able to determine the whereabouts of General Nathan Twining Read Walter Haut’s 2002 Affadavit on page 14. (in New Mexico, July 7-11, 1947) by obtaining copies of his and his pilot’s flight log. I also found a flight log for General Carl Spaatz to show he wasn’t where one of the phony MJ-12 documents described in Top Secret/Majic claimed he was. Some of us are working to find more evidence. It should be noted that Dennis Balthaser , an outstanding Roswell researcher, who actually lives in Roswell and knew Walter very well, videotaped Walter with Wendy Connors of Albuquerque, several years ago. The tape was not to be released until after Walter’s death. I saw the tape in confidence and Walter said he had seen a body and wreckage... more or less consistent with the new affidavit.

HAUT DATE: December 26, 2002 WITNESS: Chris Xxxxxx NOTARY: Beverlee Morgan (1) My name is Walter G. Haut (2) I was born on June 2, 1922 (3) My address is 1405 W. 7th Street, Rosw ell, NM 88203 (4) I am retired. (5) In July, 1947, I was stationed at the Rosw ell Army Air Base in Roswell, New Me xico, serving as the base Public Information Officer. I had spent the 4th of July week end (Saturday, the 5th, and Sunday, the 6th) at my private residence about 10 miles north of the base, which was located south of town. (6) I was aware that someone had reported the remains of a downed vehicle by midmorning after my return to duty at the base on Monday, July 7. I was aware that Major Jesse A. Marcel, head of intelligence, was sent by the base commander, Col. William Blanchard, to investigate. (7) By late in the afternoon that same day, I would learn that additional civilian reports came in regarding a second site just north of Roswell. I would spend the better part of the day attending to my regular duties hearing little if anything more. (8) On Tuesday morning, July 8, I would attend the re gularly scheduled staff meeting at 7:30 a.m. Besides Blanchard, Marcel; CIC [Counterintelligence Corp] Capt. Sheridan Cavitt; Col. James I. Hopkins, the operations officer; Lt. Col. Ulysses S. Nero, the supply off icer; and from Carsw ell AAF in Fort Worth, Texas, Blanchard’s boss, Brig. Gen. Roger Ramey and his chief of staff, Col. Thomas J. Dubose were also in attendance. The main topic of discussion was reported by Marcel and Cavitt regarding an extensive debris field in Lincoln County approx. 75 miles NW of Roswell. A preliminary briefing was provided by Blanchard about the second site approx. 40 miles north of town. Samples of wreckage were passed around the table. It was unlike any material I had or have ever seen in my life. Pieces which resembled metal foil, paper thin yet extremely strong, and pieces with unusual markings along their length were handled from man to man, each voicing their opinion. No one was able to identify the crash debris. (9) One of the main concerns discussed at the meeting was whether we should go public or not with the discovery. Gen. Ramey proposed a plan, which I believe originated from his bosses at the Pentagon. Attention needed to be diverted from the more important site north of town by acknowledging the other location. Too many civilians were already involved and the press already was informed. I was not completely informed how this would be accomplished. (10) At approximately 9:30 a.m. Col. Blanchard phoned my office and dictated the press release of having in our possession a flying disc, coming from a ranch northwest of Roswell, and Marcel flying the material to higher headquarters. I was to deliver the news release to radio stations KGFL and KSWS, and newspapers the Daily Record and the Morning Dispatch. 11) By the time the news release hit the wire services, my office was inundated with phone calls from around the world. Messages stacked up on my desk, and rather than deal with the media concern, Col Blanchard suggested that I go home and “hide out.” (12) Before leaving the base, Col. Blanchard took me personally to Building 84 [AKA Hangar P-3], a B-29 hangar located on the east side of the tarmac. Upon first approaching the building, I observed that it was under heavy guard both outside and inside. Once inside, I was permitted from a safe distance to first observe the object just recovered north of town. It was approx. 12 to 15 feet in length, not quite as wide, about 6 feet high, and more of an egg shape. Lighting was poor, but its surface did appear metallic. No windows, portholes, wings, tail section, or landing gear were visible. (13) Also from a distance, I was able to see a couple of bodies under a canvas tarpaulin. Only the heads extended beyond the covering, and I was not able to make out any features. The heads did appear larger than normal and the contour of the canvas suggested the size of a 10 year old child. At a later date in Blanchard’s office, he would extend his arm about 4 feet above the floor to indicate the height. (14) I was informed of a temporary morgue set up to accom- modate the recovered bodies. (15) I was informed that the wreckage was not “hot” (radioac- tive). (16) Upon his return from Fort Worth, Major Marcel described to me taking pieces of the wreckage to Gen. Ramey’s office and after returning from a map room, finding the remains of a weather balloon and radar kite substituted while he was out of the room. Marcel was very upset over this situa tion. We would not discuss it again. (17) I would be allowed to make at least one visit to one of the recovery sites during the military cleanup. I would return to the base with some of the wreckage which I would display in my office. (18) I was aware two separate teams would return to each site months later for periodic searches for any remaining evidence. (19) I am convinced that what I personally observed was some type of craft and its crew from outer space. (20) I have not been paid nor given anything of value to make this statement, and it is the truth to the best of my recollec- tion. Signed: WALTER G. HAUT December 26, 2002 Signature witnessed by: Chris Xxxxxxx The above text was found at http://roswellproof. homestead.com/Haut.html . It was verified as the accurate text by Lt. Haut’s daughter, Julie Shuster, who is the Director of the International UFO Museum. See her comments on page 15."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"      15 MUFON UFO Journal September 2007 By Julie Shuster Since the release of the signed affidavit by Walter Haut, there have been comments issued by the general public, members of the UFO field, and “researchers,” to name a few. The comments have been made on radio shows, in print, and on the internet. Some of the comments have been posi- tive and respectful, while others have been designed to destroy his credibility and that of the UFO Museum. This is a onetime statement made on the subject of that affidavit. Any further discussions will go without an answer or acknowledgement of any kind. My father, Walter G. Haut, dis- cussed the information contained in the affidavit with Don Schmitt over a number of years, both in person and on the phone. With my knowledge and that of my father’s, Don’s research partner, Tom Carey, was privy to the informa- tion discussed. My father was com- fortable with those discussions, since he knew at that time nothing would be made public. His confidentiality was honored. When the discussion of a signed affidavit was brought up, my father agreed to allow Don to put in writing the information they had discussed. The statement was prepared and e- mailed to me. Once it was received at the Museum, my father and I verbally discussed each and every sentence. We both had copies. With each sentence, I asked him if the information was cor- rect, or if there was anything he wanted to change. A couple of times, he read and re-read a few of the sen- tences before giving me an answer. When we had completed reading the information, I left both copies of the statement with him and went to my own office. This allowed him to review the information with no one around and no interference. When I went back to his office, we went over it again, point by point, to make sure of any changes, corrections, or deletions. He said he did not want to make any changes, so I then asked if he was ready and willing to sign the affidavit. He said he was ready. I called the Museum notary public to the office, and I also asked a visitor to come in as a witness. With those two people watching along with me, my father signed the two copies. The notary and witness both signed each copy. Each copy was placed in an envelope, sealed, and tape was placed across the flap. My father placed his initials on the tape. Both affidavits have been and remain in my possession. If my father was not willing to sign the statement because the information was false, he would not have done so. If he was being forced or coerced into signing the statement, the witnesses, and in particular the visitor, had the opportunity to stop the process by not signing. I was a facilitator in getting this information recorded. My father died in December 2005. The statement was completed in December 2002. Three years difference makes a statement an affidavit of information, not a “deathbed confes- sion.” If my father, myself, my family, or the Museum were looking for this statement to benefit any of us, let me be clear about how it came to light. We did not push it or promote it in any way. The statement was quietly re- leased in a book written by people my father and I trust. You will not see the statement on the wall of the Museum at this point. I will not say it won’t be there at some point, because it will be. It is an important part of what we are here for, of what we are all about. If there was a benefit to be gained, then the July festival would have been the time to make a big splash. My parents were never in any of this for profit or publicity, both of which they could have had for the asking any time my father would have made his statement public. One final comment—Walter Haut was my father. Other than immediate family, there is no one who knew him better. I was blessed to work with him from the fall of 2000 until early 2005. We talked a great deal about the inci- dent, about the Museum and many other things. As his daughter, I was privileged to often observe his decision making at work. I respected him immensely, as I respected both of my parents. They were honest, hard working, loving people who I will cherish to my own dying day. Recently a neighbor of mine and I were talking about my father. His parents knew both of my parents, so he asked his mother about my father and his involvement in the 1947 incident. He quoted her as saying, “If Walter Haut said it happened, then it happened.” So to the UFO field of “research- ers” stating facts they know nothing about, to the skeptics who seem to think the only way to make a point is to destroy people and their reputations, and to those who have personal grudges—“ENOUGH!!” (Signed) Julie A.

Friedman Stanton Friedman Continued on page 17 The Media and UFOs By Stan Friedman I had noted a few months back that I had expected the media to be doing a better job in their coverage of UFOs because of the super response to the Chicago Tribune article on January 1, 2007, about the O’Hare Airport sightings by United Airlines employees on November 7, 2006. The article on the front page of the Trib by reporter John Hilkevitch got over a million hits on the Trib website and led to loads of calls for interviews from all over the world. Media people suddenly realized that there was much wider interest in the UFO subject than had been thought. Events over the past month or so seem to have verified my prediction. First there was the Roswell, NM, 60 th Anniversary Festival celebration, July 5- 8. A number of us speakers were constantly being interviewed by a multitude of journalists who visited both the Civic Center site and the activities at the International UFO Museum and Research Center. Colonel Jesse Marcel Jr. (MD) sat next to me as we both signed our new books at the museum. Mine was Captured! The Betty and Barney Hill UFO Experience by myself and Kathleen Marden, Betty’s niece. His new volume is The Roswell Legacy . Don Schmitt and Tom Carey were a few tables down signing their new book Witness to Roswell with the shocking new affidavit from Walter Haut. (See book review on page 13.) Jesse and I were each interviewed by Michael Beschloss, a historian who does pieces for the NBC Today show. We both felt we were treated fairly. The piece was less than two minutes long— but no ridicule. We were each interviewed for the Sunday Night Fox network show Hannity and Colmes . I didn’t see it, but heard it was also played straight. Too many guests on Larry King Live The PR person working with Jesse had also managed to get atten-tion from the Larry King Live show. A number of us were brought to Los Angeles to do the show live on Friday, July 13, inclu- ding Jesse, flown in from Montana; myself (flown in from Fredericton, New Brunswick); James Fox, producer of the documentary “ Out of the Blue; ” George Noory, host of Coast to Coast Live, the middle-of-the-night radio show; Astronaut Buzz Aldrin (2 nd man on the moon); former Arizona governor Fife Symington (who 10 years after the fact admitted he had seen the Phoenix Lights, and is still a pilot); and Julie Shuster, IUFOMRC director and daughter of Walter Haut. She was on from Roswell. Last, but least know- ledgeable, was UFO denier (sounds better than debunker) Dr. Michael Shermer, publisher and editor of Skeptic Magazine . There were too many guests, too little control, and a lot of miscellaneous visuals. Those of us around the table were constantly interrupted by Mike, who epitomized debunkdom in the guise of science. It was quite obvious that he knew nothing about the subject of UFOs, but was adamant about attacking everything and pretending to be a scientist. His PhD is in the History of Science. His Curriculum Vitae clearly establishes he has never worked as a scientist, but as a professor and writer. A YouTube piece indicates he is good at humor and distraction from facts. Sports journalists are not the same as the athletes they cover. As it happens, Michael Shermer and James Fox were also interviewed for the ABC Nightline show, but separately, so James had no opportunity to correct the factual misstatements. Shermer seems to derive what little he knows about UFOs from the false claims made by other debunkers. He tries to claim that there are only anecdotal claims by mistaken observers... never mind radar visual cases, physical trace cases, etc. He even had the gall to claim on Larry King that a trained observer is no better than an untrained observer! As might be expected from his past ravings, he says science demands a body. Obviously he has not provided a piece of a black hole or of a neutron star. He ranted about how discovery of alien life would be the biggest story and wouldn’t and couldn’t be covered up. He had admitted to me he had never had a security clearance. The first controlled nuclear chain reaction underneath the Squash Court at Stagg Field at the University of Chicago was a monumental achievement with no publicity either. So was the breaking of the German codes, the development of the proximity fuse, the development of stealth aircraft, radar in England, and so forth. I got loads of email after the show. Many wondered why I didn’t just punch Michael out. Obviously, not my style. A lot wondered why Buzz Aldrin was on. I didn’t have a good answer. I respect his astronaut activities, but he sure took a long time to talk about his"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"      17 MUFON UFO Journal September 2007 Continued on page 20 Friedman: The Media and UFOs Continued from page 16 Identified Flying Object seen on the way to the moon, using a model to show the booster rocket and panels, etc. Incidentally, a lot of people are under the false impression that I get paid for all those TV shows I have been on (many are reruns). The fact of the matter is I don’t, except for some few shows (Merv Griffin, Ron Reagan Junior, etc.) years ago and then only because I am a member of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. Did I get paid for Larry King Live ? I left home at 4:45 AM on Friday, got home at midnight on Saturday and paid for my own meals. My payment was a Larry King mug. A few chastised me for showing the cover of my new book Captured! CNN made good money from advertisers on the show. The book was relevant to the discussion. One particularly stupid remark by Shermer was that a trained observer is no better than an untrained one. Tell that to fighter pilots and cops trying to quickly sort out friend from foe. His “reasoning” would require that an ornithologist, who claimed to see a bald eagle fly over, would have to shoot it and provide it to some lab, before we could accept his testimony. Debating Shermer on Coast to Coast A few days after the show I suggested to George Noory’s people that they have Shermer and I debate on Coast to Coast radio. It was quickly agreed. So we did battle for three hours on August 1 (3 AM-6 AM my time). I had previously debated Dr. Seth Shostak on Coast to Coast. We went at it hot and heavy. Mike had done no more homework, apparently thinking he could get away with his false reasoning and platitudes. I dug out his book Why People Believe Weird Things (2 nd Edition, Henry Holt, 2002) from the University of New Brunswick Library as well as several internet articles. Since there were only the two of us, I didn’t let him get away with anything. One little side bit on Larry King, caught by several who wrote me, was his claiming what the scientific method requires, and my managing to slip in that I was a nuclear physicist. His PhD is in the history of science and he is not a scientist. He gave me a real opening when he claimed that, after all, only 5% of the cases could not be explained and that one would expect that many as a result of the residue effect. I sprang the trap noting that it was 21.5% UNKNOWNS in the largest study ever done ( Blue Book Special Report 14 ) for the US Air Force, separate from the 9.5% Insuffi- cient Info. I noted the Secretary of the Air Force’s false claim about only 3% UNKNOWN. I noted that according to a special UFO committee of the Amer- ican Institute of Astronautics and Aeronautics, that a full 30% of the University of Colorado cases could not be explained, that gold is worth mining if there is an ounce of gold per ton of ore. I stressed that in his book he never mentioned BBSR 14, or the Colorado study or Dr. J. Allen Hynek or his book, the UFO Experience or the nine other PhD theses about UFOs besides the one he had noted, nor had he mentioned the Congres-sional Hearings of 1968 with Dr. James E. McDonald’s outstanding paper with 41 excellent cases and the testimony from 11 other scientists, nor the books by Dr. Jacques Vallee, or the work of Dr. James Harder, Dr. Leo Sprinkle, etc. I noted the new NARCAP Report (152 pages) about the O’Hare case, by Dr. Richard Haines, retired NASA scientist. I will admit that I took great delight in quoting two reasons from his book, Chapter 18, Why Smart People Believe Weird Things, for why he believes such a weird notion that there is no evidence indicating some UFOs are alien space- craft. From page 283: “Smart people believe weird things because they are skilled at defending beliefs they arrived at for non-smart reasons.” BINGO. Clearly this applies not only to Michael, but also to Dr. Joseph Nickell, the paid “scientific” investigator for the newly named “Committee for Scientific Inquiry” which used to be CSICOP. His three degrees in English and his experience as a magician (master of deception) hardly provide scientific training (as demonstrated by his explanation of a 6 foot owl for the Flatwoods Monster). The second quote from Michael’s book that applies to the debunkers is from page 299: “The Confirmation Bias, or the tendency to seek or interpret evidence favorable to already existing beliefs, and to ignore or reinterpret evidence unfavorable to already existing beliefs.” Bingo again. I realize that some debunkers try to turn this one around on me. I should point out that I had shown that a host of supposed MJ-12 documents were fraudulent in To p Secr et/Majic .... besides the ones that are genuine. Shermer and Clancy on abductions The subject of abductions came up. I took the opportunity to note that Michael had given a very strong endorsement on Amazon.com to Dr. Susan Clancy’s book Why People Come to Believe They Were Kidnapped by Aliens . I have posted a detailed critique of her work on my website at www .stantonfriedman.com noting that she couldn’t seem to get any facts right and that she had started from the crazy position that all abductees were suffering from False Memory Syndrome, “since we know that abductions don’t happen.” Sleep paralysis was another of her favorites, despite all the cases in which the people aren’t sleeping, such as in the Betty and Barney Hill case. A vote was taken towards the end of the third hour; 80% thought I had won. Only 20% thought he had won."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"September 2007 18 MUFON UFO Journal Physical Physical Physical Physical Physical Traces Traces Traces Traces Traces By Ted Phillips Observations of small light balls at Marley Woods The sightings of light orbs this spring and summer in the Marley Woods area of Missouri are nothing new. There have been a series of similar sightings in this area for years. On the evening of April 1, 1999, three witnesses observed a small white object approaching the cabin at Site 1. Sunset was at 6:28 pm with twilight ending at 7:56 pm. The full moon was 15 degrees above the eastern horizon, placing it behind and slightly lower than the position of the object. The Site 1 property owner des-cribes the event: “Tonight from 7:00 pm to 7:55 pm, my wife and I along with two friends sat at the farm visiting. The night was warm, however skies were thinly cloudy with high clouds. “At 7:55, our friends began to turn their vehicle around and leave the farm while my wife and I carried chairs back to the cabin yard and to E. B. who was in the back room of the cabin. After taking E’s chair to him, we stood at the back porch talking to him and he stood on the porch talking to us. “As E stood on the porch facing the east, suddenly he yelled, “There they are!” “My wife and I quickly turned around and all three of us witnessed an extremely fast moving sphere of white light about the size of a beach ball moving from the south to the north. The object was not much higher than my windmill (30 feet) and passed between the windmill and my wagon shed (40 feet away) just above the trees. “When the object got to the front of the cabin near a large bell in the front yard, it made an instant left curve turn and appeared to continue on a left curve or upward as it vanished behind the cabin. “There was absolutely no sound or wind created by the object. The object passed directly in front of Ted’s camera that was operating; however, its height of around 40 feet might have been out of camera view. (I feel there is a very good chance the object did pass close enough to be picked up by the camera.) “Our friends did not see the object as they drove down the road away from the cabin. The object curved its path to the left between Continued on page 19 the cabin and their vehicle. “When we ran to the camera it was shut down and the tape was ejected. The camera wouldn’t work and the VCR also failed to function.” I (Phillips) had placed a video unit on the east side of the spring house to monitor the area from sunset to sun- rise. The camera was linked with a VCR unit to lengthen the recording time. It had been in operation since March 15, 1999. Seventeen tapes were stored three feet from the camera and were all ruined—they would not record. Bob Nicholson, a video expert, examined the camera and stated that the camera appeared to have been exposed to extreme heat. It should be noted that the care- taker (E) first observed the object flying from the Site 2 area up the hill to Site 1. It did not appear to change altitude until it passed over the camera when it dropped down and made the tight left turn to avoid trees in front of the cabin. The flight path put it behind the vehicle that was leaving and moving in the same direction. It was first seen near a pond SE of the cabin and was observed for some 900 feet to the left turn.

The light followed a mile or so then suddenly went over the car, landed in front of her vehicle, ascended at high speed and disap-peared in the distance. After the light moved away, her engine stalled but restarted after a few minutes. The car did not run well after the event. The light left the ground to fly down the road to a point 1.5 miles W of the beginning of the Sara C—— car chase by a very similar object years later. October 2000. Same road as the 1973 event. Sara C—— was driving home from work at 11:00 pm when she saw a small but very bright white globe behind her car. It continued to pace the vehicle for over a mile and suddenly gained speed and flew along side the car. It was over the west-bound lane less than 6 feet from her side window at a height of some 4 feet above the road. With another burst of speed it passed the car and then paced it from a point less than 20 feet in front of the vehicle. After another mile it increased speed and disappeared down the road. When Sara turned into her driveway she saw it hovering over a pond south of the road. She ran into the house and told her family and they watched it from the living room window. Her father called the owner of the pond property and he and his wife watched as the object continued to move up and down over the pond. Finally, after several minutes it ascended vertically and disappeared. July 23, 2000. Highway W of Site 1. At 11:30 pm, two witnesses driving W saw a small circular white globe coming toward the car. It was moving just above the eastbound lane when it appeared to go into the S ditch. It bounced out of the ditch and moved N across the pavement. It was less than 1 meter in diameter. It glided at high speed across the road and into the woods just N of the highway and disap- peared in the woods. It was headlight high as it crossed in front of the car. This was 6,800 feet from site 1. July 26, 2000. Highway 9, 200 feet from Site 1. At 11:00 pm, two witnesses were driving W when they saw two small white globes moving N on M road. The lights were headlight high above the road and moving fast. They were headed to a “T” intersection with the highway and the witnesses were moving toward them as they went across the highway into woods N of the highway. They were seen 2,000 feet from the 7/23/00 sighting of the small globe on the highway. August 9, 2000. 3,600 feet from Site 1, 10:30 pm. Site 1 owner’s cousin and a friend driving W saw a small white globe coming from the trees S of the highway and behind a house. It quickly crossed the highway some 200 feet in front of their vehicle. It was about headlight high over the pavement. After crossing the road into a small clearing N of the highway it ascended a few feet and hovered. They backed up to the clearing and it was gone. This event took place on the same road 5,800 feet from event 7/26/00 and 4,100 feet from the 7/23/00 event. Three sightings in 16 days. July 18, 2001. 8,300 feet W of Site 1. At 11:00 pm, William C——’s sister was driving home from work. She turned off the same highway as the three previous cases onto Rte M and after a very short distance she saw three small white globes on each side of her vehicle. They were level with the roof of the vehicle and less than 10 feet away. They matched the speed of the car even when she accelerated trying to get away from them. The lights paced the car for almost 2 miles before banking away from each side of the car and disappearing in the distance. July 11, 2002. County road 4, 6 miles SE of Site 1. Joe C—— & Chris C—— were driving a country road north of Rte — and parallel to —. Suddenly a basketball-size sphere of white light came toward them. As they came closer, it bounced on the road and stopped. One of the men grabbed his rifle which had a scope on it. All he could see through the scope was a bright white light; no shots were fired. A few seconds later it flew away out of sight. A Cemetery Encounter June 26, 2006. Cemetery 1,400 feet S of Site 1, 200 feet from Site 2, 10:30 pm. Shirley R and her husband were watching for large amber displays in the cemetery. It was a clear, calm night. After watching for an hour outside of the car, they began to see white balls of light popping up and arching over from the N and NE tree line. After a short time two of the lights moved toward the cemetery; when they were 150 feet away one of the globes turned and flew away to the east, disappearing in the trees. As the second light continued toward the witnesses, Shirley thought it was going to hit them and dived to the ground. It passed between them at shoulder height, crossed a gravel road, and over the field south of the road and turned into a tree line. They estimated the size of the globes to be 6 inches in diameter. There was no sound, heat or movement of air as the device passed them at a distance of less than five feet."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"September 2007 20 MUFON UFO Journal Friedman: The Media and UFOs Continued from page 17 Yes, I am well aware that perhaps most of the listeners to Coast to Coast might be UFO believers.

Maybe if he admitted his ignorance and bias, he would have to abandon Skeptic , a slick publication selling all matter of debunking and denier literature, DVDs, videos, and so forth.

Con- gratulations to Cheryl Ann Gilmore (South Carolina), Tracey C. Smith (Kansas), Donald R. Burleson (New Mexico) for being 1st, 2nd and 3rd respectively in the month of August. The top 10 State Directors are high- lighted in yellow. The report is based on our two measures of UFO Investigation effectiveness. Assigning reports within 48 hours of receipt, and completing all investigations within 60 days of being assigned. The “Assigned” column is a six month running average of the number of cases assigned within 48 hours divided by the total number of cases received in that six month period. The “Completed” column is the number of cases completed beginning sixtytwo (62) days back and going back six months from there (for a total of eight months back) divided by the total number of cases reported in the same period. The “Weighted Rank” is just the average of the two columns expressed as a percent. State Directors can improve their scores by being sure to assign all cases within 48 hours, and to follow up with their Field Investigators to ensure all reports are completed within 60 days. To be considered complete a report must have been investigated and placed in one of the three com- pleted status codes (Unknown, Hoax or IFO) by you the State Director.

At about 3:00 AM the radiant is about 50 degrees above the horizon. To best observe the Orionids wear appropriate clothing for the weather and lie outside in a reclining lawn chair. The two best ways to observe the Orionids is either by pointing your feet southward (the general direction of the radiant) and looking in the region straight up, or pointing your feet south-westward and have your centre of gaze around 60° above the horizon. Do not look directly at the radiant, because meteors directly in front of you will not move much and fainter ones might be missed. Other minor meteor showers will be going on at the time and stray meteors, more commonly called sporadics, will frequently be seen that do not belong to a meteor shower. When you see a meteor mentally trace it backwards and if you arrive at the region just north-east of the main body of Orion outlined in the picture above, it is prob- ably an Orionid. Fortunately the first quarter moon will be absent from the early morning sky and will not interfere with observation of the meteor shower. Zodiacal Light: Zodiacal light will be visible in northern latitudes in the East before the start of morning twilight from October 20 to November 3. The phenomenon is only visible from very dark locations. Zodiacal light is sunlight bouncing off dust grains in our solar system. These grains lie mostly in the plane of the solar system. Look for a pyramid of light in the morning sky somewhat in appearance to the light from a city or town just over the horizon.

For northern hemisphere observers Mercury will be difficult to observe as it will be very low in the western twilight sky at the beginning of the month and will disap- pear into the glare of the sun as the month progresses. For southern hemisphere ob- servers Mercury will begin the month above the western horizon setting about 2 hours after the Sun but will sink into the glare of the Sun near the end of the month. Mars (magnitude -0.1 to -0.4): In Gemini. For northern hemisphere observers Mars will be rising above the eastern horizon about 4 hours after sunset and will be standing high above the southeast horizon as the Sun rises. For southern hemisphere observers Mars will be rising above the eastern hori- zon about 6.5 hours after sunset and will be standing above the northern horizon as the Sun rises. Jupiter : (magnitude –2.0 to -1.9). In Ophiuchus. For northern hemisphere ob- servers the beginning of the month will find Jupiter above the south-southwest horizon as the Sun sets and will follow the Sun be- low the western horizon about 3 hours later; by the end of the month Jupiter will set about 2 hours after the Sun. For southern hemi- sphere observers the beginning of the month will find Jupiter above the western horizon as the Sun sets and will follow the Sun below the western horizon about 5.5 hours later; by the end of the month Jupiter will set about 3 hours after the Sun.. Bright Planets (Morning Sky) : Venus (magnitude -4.4 to -4.3): In Leo. For northern hemisphere observers Venus will begin the month rising above the east- ern horizon about 3 ½ hours before the Sun and standing above the east-southeast ho- rizon as the Sun rises. By the end of the month Venus will be rising about 4 hours before Sun and will be standing high above the south-eastern horizon as the Sun rises. For southern hemisphere observers Venus will begin the month rising above the east- northeast horizon about 2 hours before the Sun and will be standing above the north- northeast horizon as the Sun rises. Saturn (magnitude 0.7 to 0.8): In Leo. For northern hemisphere observers Saturn will begin the month rising above the east- ern horizon about 3 hours before the Sun. By the end of the month Saturn will be ris- ing about 5 hours before Sun and will be standing high above the southeast horizon as the Sun rises. For southern hemisphere observers Saturn will begin the month ris- ing above the eastern horizon about 1 hour before the Sun and will be standing above the east-northeast horizon as the Sun rises. By the end of the month Saturn will be ris- ing about 2.5 hours before the Sun and will be standing above the northeast horizon as the Sun rises. Other Celestial Phenomena : Orionids Meteor Shower: This shower produces fast meteors (40 miles/sec.). About 20% will leave trails. While the rate is stated to be 25 per hour it can vary between 10 and 70 per hour. The duration of this meteor shower extends from October 15 to 29, with maximum occurring on October 22. The point from where the Orionid meteors appear to radiate is located within the constellation Orion and is referred to as the radiant. The radiant is located in the north-eastern part of that constellation. The radiant rises around 10:30 PM local Looking low above the eastern horizon before sunrise on October 7, 2007"}]
