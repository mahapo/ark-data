The DICK CAVETT Show On November 2, Dick Cavett gave the Mutual UFO Network nationwide TV publicity when he acknowledged the use of nine UFO photographs on his show devoted entirely to UFOs. Participants appearing as Dick's guests were Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Brig. General James McDivitt (astronaut), Dr. Carl Sagan (astronomer), Capt. Lawrence Coyne (helicopter pilot), Charles Hickson (P ascagoula, Miss.), and John Wallace Spencer (author). \"The Dick Cavett Show,\" Daphne Productions, Inc., is to be commended for their outstanding programming and selection of guests, making it undoubtedly the finest UFO TV program in recent years. Our personal thanks not only to Dick Cavett, but to John Berendt and Joan Kramer, who worked with your director behind the scenes. Center For UFO Studies Dr. J.

It has proved a difficult task, however, to sum- marize SKYNET's multiple purposes and results. Originally conceived by the Los Angeles NICAP Subcommittee in 1965, SKYNET, a unique UFO tracking/identification system, is now an official adjunct of the Mutual UFO Network and its Southern California Section. In view of the present nationwide flap and the heightened scientific approach to UFO research, Walt Andrus, MUFON Director, and the MUFON members in our area feel it is time to spread the idea of SKYNET to other cities and rural localities through- out the country. Basically, SKYNET is a group of dedicated UFO researchers and other interested citizens, comprising a loosely-knit skywatch team. It involves immediate dissem- ination of sighting information, prompt investigation and analysis of results for correlative purposes. The heart of the system is the SKYNET map. Though concentrated in the Los Angeles Basin, the map's southern limit is San Diego near the Mexican border, its northern rim is the Antelope Valley, its eastern edge is the Santa Ana-Orange County area of Heflin fame, and the western edge isthe Pacific Ocean and its offshore islands. The location of each of 52 member locations are marked with numbered signal dots, their numbers corresponding to information on a Member List. Each member is provide d a map, list, and Instructions on Procedure. By means of these, which are kept current through laborious detailed work, each member knows who lives in line-of-sight of any unexplained object in the sky. The equipment available to SKYNET runs through the' usual cameras, binoculars, elevation-finders, compasses, recorders, telescopes etc up to such exotic devices as UFO dectors, a radio telescope, and an advanced design fisheye camera/magnetometer invention! The gathering of good UFO reports is SKYNET's main task. But we have gained spinoff results such as the sharpening of identification skills. Having become familiar with local atmospheric conditions, some peculiar to the Los Angeles area, we have learned to recognize many conventional objects which can become twisted into weird and puzzling shadows of their real selves. In addition, we have de- tected recurring phenomena such as mystifying \"cloud cigars\" in the Santa Catalina Channe] and small, craft-like objects in Orange County which have a penchant for close approaches to witnesses. In spite of all its exhausting and time-consuming work, SKYNET has proved well worthwhile. Statistical studies are now being made on the more than 200 cases already on our report charts. The data is being fed into the MUFON computer lists and Dave Saunder's UFOCAT. If there are readers out there who feel they might like to begin a SKYNET system in their area, they are invited to write me at 257 Sycamore Glen, Pasadena, California 91105.

In Bind Valley, California, about 30 miles northwest of Los Angeles, Gary J. Chopic, saw an unidentified object and an occupant on October 4, 1973. Several reports have reached SKY.LOOK, and—as usual—we draw on the reporting by David Branch and Robert B. Klinn (\"The Register,\" Santa Ana, Calif.) for the best account of the event. The authors went first to police department headquarters, Sind Valley, and ob- tained a copy of the police report. Lt. C. G. Chrestman said, \"The first thing Chop- ic said to me was 'I 'm not a drinking man, and I just got through eating dinner. .'\" The official report follows: City of Simi Valley Case No. 73-20548 Date 10-4-73 Time 1850 (6:50 p.m.) Type of Complaint U.F.O. Person Reporting, Chopic, Gary Jay R-P (person reporting) states he was W-B (westbound) on the Simi Fwy (freeway) at approx. 1850 hrs, driving his 1973 Chev wagon in the NR (number) 2 lane. R-P states as he was climbing the hill towards Pass Road, he obs (observed) an unk (unknown) object, just above the top of the hills. R-P states the object appeared to look like a space cone. The object dropped behind the hills and out of sight. R-P states he pulled to the slow lane of traffic and reduced his speed. R-P stated as he ap- proached the off ramp for Kuehner Dr he obs a cloud of dust off to right side of the Fiiy and below it. R-P stated he stopped on the Fwy shoulder and above the Kuehner off ramp and got out of his ^eh ( vehicle) to see where the dust was coming from. R-P states he obs a large object approx 30' X 50', triangle shape with a 10' blunt nose on it. R-P states it was pink-gray in color, with no visible lights. R-P states he obs this object for approx 3 min, and during this time itdid not appear to touch the ground. R-P states while watching the object a man came out of the front and crawled to the rear and but of sight. The object had w hat appeared to be a bubble on top, and it rolled over after the man was gone. R-P states at this time dust engulfed the object and whole area. R-P stated when the dust cleared the object was gone, and so was the man. Reporting Officer W. Nelson 115 Reviewed by Officer C. G. Chrestman 4 Oct 73 That is the basic story, without a fill-in of details. We obtained these from the \"Register\" report of Oct. 3!, 1973 and also from Bob Engens report in Oct. 12 edition of \"Tfre Enterprise Sun & News.\" Chopic estimated his distance from object as 80 to 100 feet. As it hovered about 10 feet above the ground, it swayed \"like a boat at anchor.\" Chopic said a large insignia covered the entire side oft he craft. He said it looked like a huge V with progressively smaller Vs inside the larger figure. In the waning light of twilight, he could not discern whether colors were involved or whether it was, indeed, an insignia-at all, but perhaps a series of vents. There were no visible windows or doors but from the bottom of the craft protruded a hose-like object approximately eight feet long and about one foot in diameter that not quite reached the ground. At the top of the vehicle, Chopic noted a clear glass-like bubble approximately three feet in diameter which swiveled \"like a ball.\" \"From inside the bubble I could see a light colored object moving around, and as I continued to look, an individual came from the opposite side of the machine crawling around the side toward the front—the narrower end of the craft. He looked up toward me and scrambled to the other side of the craft and disappeared. But just"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"about the time he spotted me, I heard a clicking sound which lasted two to three seconds-sounding something like an automatic weapon from a distance.\" Chopic said the \"being\" looked like a man of normal dimensions, but he wore something.appearing similar to a wet suit except that it was a lighter color, . . perhaps silver. While he could not see the man's facial features, the face look- ed darker than the uniform. After the man retreated inside the vehicle, the bubble again rotated and dis- appeared inside, flush with the .smooth deck of the craft, Chopic said. Suddenly the vehicle began to make a whirring or low humming sound and at the same time a fog-rlike substance began to appear, enveloping the .entire craft. The \"fog\" ex- uded a sweet odor, not flowery, Chopic said, but perhaps close to certain incense scents. And all disappeared almost inmediatel y. Chopic said he sat in his car for sometime trying to decide if he shou Id report what he had seen. He felt many would think he was \"nuts,\" but decided to make the report as he felt the authorities should know and consider the fact it might happen again and perhaps involve some danger. Chopic has never believed in UFOs and isn't sure now that visitors from outer space can come to earth—but he is disturbed by what he saw and has no explanation for it. . ' It is interesting to note that after the report appeared in \"The Enterprise,\" a woman who declined to identify herself, called Chopic to inform him she and her husband also had seen a similar object in the same locality one week prior to Chopic's sighting. She descritied the object as round, but Chopic reasoned that if viewed from different angles, it could appear either round or cigar shaped. Source: Newspapers named in article..

California Pete Hart stra, '19, a Monterey, Calif, parking lot attendant, says he and two friends saw a spherical object surrounded by a bluish green glow and trailing an orange yellow tail come over Cannery Row Tuesday night, Oct. 16. Hartstra de- scribed the object which he said was just high enough to clear the buildings as \"larger than a Cadillac.\" It made no noise as it moved rapidly overhead, dropped down behind the .restaurant and disappeared.. He ran to the Bay side of the restaurant but saw nothing. Sgt. Ken Froberg, of Marin City, Calif, said he sighted a \"bluish-green object like a ball with an orange tail\" that streaked through the sky for about five sec- onds before disappearing. Deputy John Brunslik, on duty at Point Reyes, reported seeing a \"white object like a meteorite falling downward sideways that turned a reddish color and then burst apart.\" He said it then reappeared and burst apart again. Calls were received from Los Angeles to San Franciso from people who saw the bright object.

L awrence Coyne, a member of the 316th Med- ical Detachment stationed at Cleveland, Ohio, Hopkins Airport, was returning from Columbus at 11 p.m. Oct. 18. They were flying at 2,500 feet when the crew chief, Spec 5 Robert J. Yanacsek, 23, reported a red light about five miles to the east. Captain Coyne said the crew at first thought it was a radio beacon, but Spec- ialist Yanacsek yelled, ''The light is moving. It's coming at us. It's on a colli- sion course!\" Coyne, a veteran of 19 years of military flying, grabbed the controls from his co-pilot, Lt. Arriggo D. Jezzi, 26, of Sandusky. \"It looked like a fighter plane coming straight for us,\" he said. \"I took immediate evasive action. I cut the power and dropped into a shallow dive.We dropped to 2,000 feet, and it was headed right for us. We braced for impact.\" Captain Coyne said that when the helicopter reached 1,500 feet, the approach- ing craft appeared to stop momentarily about 500 feet overhead and banked to one side. \"We looked up and saw it stopped right over us,\" Coyne said. \"It had a big, gray metallic-looking hull about 60 feet long.\" '¥e never saw anything like it before,\" he said. \"It was unreal ... a cigar shaped craft with a glowing steady red light on its leading edge. A hull was at the very top of it and a green light emitted from the rear of the craft filled our cabin with a green glow. It was eerie.\" Captain Coyne said the strange craft hovered over the helicopter only a few seconds. He said he glanced at the altimeter and\" noticed that the helicopter had risen to 3,800 feet. None of the crew members felt the gravitational pull normally felt when a hel- icopter rises, Captain Coyne added. \"We felt a bounce, and then the other craft took off to the northeast.\" Seconds later the craft disappeared. The'pilot said efforts were made to radio Mansfield Airport immediately, but the helicopter received no response. He said the unusual communications blackout lasted about 10 minutes, until radio contact was established with the Akron-Canton Airport. Based'on the quick appearance and disappearance of the craft, the crew members estimated its speed at more than 600 miles per hour. Captain Coyne said a conven- tional aircraft flying that close to the helicopter would create a great deal of noise but said no noise was heard. The crew confirmed Captain Coyne's report and all agreed they had never seen anything like the strange aircraft before. Flight officials contacted after the chopper landed could offer no explanation.

Our thank you to Betty R. Parker, one of pur new subscribers, for sending.us the news clip (also for the others, Betty). Here's the story: A business woman from Huntsville can't explain her bizarre experience on the Georgia super highway. Nothing like it has ever happened to her before. The woman, who asked to remain anonymous, said she saw a four-foot-tall \"metal man\" who appeared to be wearing a metallic'pewter-like outfit capped \"with a \"bubble.\" or dome made of the same material. - - '    ; , . She could, only see .it .\"from what I would call the waist up\" out of her stalled car's window, and the bubble had two, rectangular slits for eyes. There were' rib other openings in the football helmet-size dome,, she said. Based-dri-aK interview with the Huntsville woman, here is the story that ,unfolds on the afternoon of Friday, Oct. 19, 1973, oh Interstate 75 just south of Atlanta and north of Tifton, Ga.: (For the ! purposes of this article, the woman will be identified as Mrs. Rtfbinson.) Mrs. Robinson said she set out alone in .her car on that Friday from Huntsville bound for Tifton.    ,  '\" .   -  . South \"of Atlanta on Interstate 75, Mrs. Robinson .stopped at a filling station to get gasoline arid have her car routinely checked. The tank was filled and the car certified ready. She was on her way. Traveling at a high \"irate of .speed, Mrs. Robinson was about 20 minutes north of Tifton when her car's engine and all systems mysteriously quit working. Her power brakes were out. Her power steering was out. Nothing worked. It was about 3:30 p.m.     ... She managed to guide the car off the interstate onto the shoulder ofthe road. The countryside is fairly level in that area.   \".,•'.-,-. \"The car just quit,\" recalls Mrs. Robinson. \"There was no noise .* .absolutely nothing.\"..     . '  '.\"'-...\" ,  , So far, that is the only strange thing that had happened. Once she was off the road, however, she said a \"strange feeling\" began to creep in. Sitting numbly be- hing the wheel, she sensed something weird and turned her head slightly, slowly, . very mechanically to the left towards the road. It was there. Standing right next to her. Her window was rolled up and she was afraid to look it in the eyes. \"If the window was down, I could have touched it,\" said Mrs. Robinson.. \"It was that close.\" ;    , .   ..- . \"I just didn't really believe it was real. But it really was. I\"could see part of it, from what I would call the waist up. It was dressed in a metallic material, sort of like pewter. The bubble was made of the same material. . . there were two openings\" for the eyes. The slits were rectangular.\" . - • \"Afraid, Mrs. Robinson said'she just could not bring herself to look point blank at the creature.  ...... The whole incident took only five or six minutes before the creature disappeared after walking from the left side ofthe car to the front and then around tp the - '. back.   . .   -  . . Its gait was much like anyone's, recalls Mrs. Robinson. While she could not see below its. \"waist\" tp determine whether the strange creature had legs, she did notice that when it walked, its bubble dome—or head?— seemed to be more mechanical than fluid, or skeletal. The dome went from right to left, left to right, up and down as though it were a programmed robot or automation. A deduction was that it could only see out of the eye slits and those \"head\" turns were necessary for seeing what was not directly in front.   ' ; Mrs. Robinson said she could detect no strange sounds, pdprs pr lights. She did not see any kind pf air craft pr vehicle."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"And, she said she had not had a drink nor was she taking any kind of drug or tranquilizer. After the creature seemed to have disappeared (she looked through her rear view mirror but ;was afraid to turn around or make any sudden movements). Mrs. Robinson got out of her car. She said she was afraid it might blow up or something. She looked around and didn't sea the creature. Then, she decided to raise the hood on her car to attract a passing motorist for assistance. But when she opened the hood to her car, smoke came billowing out. There was no fire. Only smoke. It was intensly hot, so hot, she said, that once a wrecker got the car to a garage the hood was nearly at the melting stage. \"It was so hot and the metal so soft, that it looked like you could poke your thumb through it. But the paint was not affected.\" It was about an hour and a half after the car quit and the creature appeared that a Georgia state trooper's car stopped and called for a wrecker. Then, another hour and a half passed (a total of three hours since the car quit) before a mechanic could touch the engine because of the heat. Mrs. Robinson said the trooper told her there had been several other reports from motorists like here that day. Witnesses Watch UFO Landing in Pennsylvania - Hairy Creatures Seen Some 15 persons said they witnessed the landing of a huge, reddish, ball-like object on a farm field along the Vances Mill-Bute Road in North Union township, Thursday night, Oct. 25 j and several saw \"hairy creatures\" in the area. Stanley Gordon, director of the Westmoreland County UFO Study Group, and his team of investigators were at the scene the next day to talk to witneses and take tests of the area. Nothing but normal background radiation was found; however, Gordon told the Uniontown \"Evening Standard\" (from which this account is written) that farm animals in the area, dogs or cows, would not go near the area where the creatures were seen and the UFO reportedly landed, because of fear. George Kowalczyk probably had the best view of the happening on his father's farm. He was driving along the road when he saw an orange light in the sky over his father's field. He parked his truck, took his rifle and two neighbor boys to investigate. \"He said he watched the thing descend slowly to the ground,\" Gordon reported. \"This time it was completely white. It was about 100 feet in diameter, as big as a house, with a dome on top. It was very, very bright.\"      • The object made a sound similiar to that of a large lawnmower. Meanwhile, one of the youths with Kowalczyk spotted something moving along a fence. Kowalczyk described two creatures, one about eight feet tall and the other about seven feet, walking stiff-legged. They were completely covered with a dark, grayish hair, had long arms that extended almost to the ground and they were making crying sounds such as a baby would make. A sharp odor similar to sulphur could be smelled, which has been noted in most ofthe other sightings of such creatures. While one of the youths ran away in fear, Kowalczyk fired a shot into the air and then directly at the creatures as they began to approach him. \"The larger creature made a moaning sound, raised his right hand and the light in the field disappeared and the sound stopped. The two creatures then slowly walked away,\" Kowaldzyk, 22, told Gordon.;. He added that his eyes began to bother him at this time, and that the lights on his pickup truck dimmed. He got into his truck and called the State Police. Both Gordon and a trooper at the scene acknowledged that Kowalczyk was visibly shaken the the incident. . No physical signs of a landing were evident and no footprints were found. However, the pasture was cropped low by grazing cattle. The investigation is continuing.

UFO Spins Car Around; Projects Deer \"Backward\" In Pennsylvania — A Columbia County (Pennsylvania) man says a UFO circled his auto as he was driving to work yesterday and caused his car to be turned around on a mountainous rural road. \"It was right above the car going around and around,\" said Edward Deutsch, 47. \"When I got to the top of the mountain, it lit up the whole car, and before I knew what happened the car was turned around and I was headed back home.\" Deutsch, who commutes 70 miles daily to the Mack Truck plant in Allentown from Hazleton, said he was so frightened \"it took me 10 minutes to figure out actually which way I was going.\" The car's body was extremely hot afterward, he said. He said the object appeared to be about the size of a traator-trailer tire and was flying at about the level of the trees. It stayed with him about five minutes. Deutsch also told of meeting a deer hunter who saw the unidentified flying object hovering while two deer walking across the road were projected backward. After that experience, he decided to call his hunting trip off. Source: Pennsylvania \"Harrisburg Evening News,\" Oct. 18, 1973. Credit: Ruth Gamble.

He lost vite^al contact, momentarily, but stopped his vehicle and located the object again. It was stopped about 500 yards to the north at eye level; It hovered about three minutes, giving Spilde time to hold a radio microphone out of the jeep so that a dispatcher at the proving grounds could hear the noise, reported to be a swishing sound similar to that of a rope being twisted in 'the air. Spilde told Yuma County sheriff's deputies the object was surrounded by bright blue, strobe-type lights. \" It was much larger than a fighter plane, he said.

He said the still pictures did not come out and the movie film is being . processed.He and his deputies did, however, play for reporters a recording of what they said was the sound the craft made, a rather high pitched whirring noise. Lt. Payton said the deputies went to the area when they were notified by a deputy who waslistening to his citizen's band radio and heard Miss Barbara Smith, Rt. 6, Slidell,had recorded unusual sounds on her CB radio, sounds which later appeared to be eminating from the strange craft.

What was strange, however-was that the object had an irregular form and through binoculars, one could 'see a structure of some sort of balloon divided by .plastic panels. At the same time telephone calls were received from Zilina that they were observing the same strange object. The problem was, that the myster- ious object was/not'that high that it would have been possible to see it at the same time in Bratislav and Zilina.

They climbed to ari altitude of 19 kilometers, but the unidentified object, was more than 10 kilometers higher. This we learned from the workers of the Meteorological Institute in Ivanke.

Jean Sendy's most recent paperback is entitled THE COMING OF THE GODS and is well worth reading. I was not too impressed by the author's previous work, THOSE GODS WHO MADE HEAVEN AND EARTH, but this new title is far more interesting and helpful. Basically, Sendy is a proponent of the theory that the legendary \"gods\" were space visitors who played a major role in the development of early man. His interpretations of Biblical events in the light of his theory are certainly food for thought. I consider his comments of UFOs to be \"all wet,\" but I would definitely recommend the book for those who are fascinated (as I am) by such speculations.

Brinsley LePoer Trench is one of England's most prolific authors of books on UFOs, having now written six books on the subject. His latest is entitled MYSTERIOUS VISITORS—THE UFO STORY. Most of the book is taken up with a summary of UFO events and thinking over the past few years and may be a bit on the re-hash side for Ufologists. All the familiar subjects are here—UFOs and religionj UFOs in his- tory, teleportations, parapsychology and UFOs, \"window\" areas, etc. In the latter part of the book, Trench discusses the concept that man is a hybrid being, quot- ing from other writers on the subject. Perhaps the most valuable material is found in Chapter 29, \"The Instantaneous Way to the Stars,\" wherein Trench covers the theories of so-called \"hyperspace\" or shortcuts to the stars.

Almost on the eastern edge of Triangulum is M-33, the great spiral galaxy in Triangulum. This galaxy is at about the same distance from our galaxy as M-31, the Andromeda galaxy—about 2 million light years. M-33 is diffuse and without definite arm structure. This concludes my series of constellations. I hope our readers found it interesting and informative. In closing I would like to quote the following from a book published by the Knights of Columbus: \"God can be found anywhere, particularly at the end of a telescope. The earth, the moon, the planets, the sun and millions of stars billions of miles away all prove that a superhuman power put them there. Men like Columbus who sailed into the unknown seas or the astronauts who have rocketed into unexplored space .have been impressed by that superhuman power and have prayed to it because that power is God.\"   . In this constellation series I have covered some of th.e most prominent constella- tions seen in the northern hemisphere at a latitude of approximately AO degrees north. Constellations like Orion, and Aurus, Leo and Ursa Major have been known since an- cient times.   • -- ' Since Galileo invented the first astronomical telescope in 1609 many new dis- coveries have been made by astronomers—as John and William Herschel, Kepler, Cop- ernicus and more recently Dr. Clyde Tombaugh and Dr. Harlow Shapley. From the prim- itive telescope of Galileo to the 200 inch reflector at Mt. Palomar, millionsof new galaxies, nebulae etc have been observed. Perhaps the most significant being the recent discovery of pulsars and quasars. The last objects, according to astron- omers, could be at the very edge of the universe about 12 billion light years away. Editor's Note: We can assure Mark his series has been read and enjoyed, as this page has always been the subject of favorable comment, from our readers. We only wish we could give it more space. And we'll be hearing more from Mark. Did you see this cartoon? Two little flying occupants are peering into a window of Sky lab.

He continues to receive fine cooperation from the news media around Greensburg and beyond, and has been having more UFO sight- ings referred to him than he and his investigators can keep up with—a statement that is being made all over MUFONland these days. Ted Phillips, of Sedalia, Mo., and'MUFON Secretary, appeared on the Show-Me Forum, Channel 7 TV, Central Missouri State University TV station, Warrensburg, on an hour-long UFO program with re- porters from local radio stations and newspapers present.

Clarence Dargie, of 0' Fallen, 111., made six lectures in October ; five for November and is booked until May. He reports he enjoyed meet- ing Erich von Daniken and appearing on the program with him at Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville the latter part of October. The two promised to keep in touch with each other. On October 26 Mr. Dargie addressed the students at Collins- ville High School (111.) and was told he could have all the time he wanted. The session started at 7:30 A.M. and he managed to break away from the enthusiastic and interested students at 12V30 p.m. George D. Fawcett. of Mount Airy, N.C., appeared on the Bill Boggs Interview Program, Nov. 12 over WGHP TV with a panel of Astronaut James Irwin and Astronomy Professor Wayne Christiansen of the University of North Carolina. He addressed his hometown high school (Mount Airy Senior High) and faculty and the large student body at George Witt High School in Whythesville, Virginia recently. On Nov. 20, Mr. Fawcett gives his 2| hour lecture \"UFOs-Still Unknown\" at the M.C. Benton Convention Center in downtown Winston-Salem. He states UFO reports have been received from 35 cities and towns in North Carolina, with more than 100 cases during the past three weeks.\"We are \"swamped,\" he writes. The October meeting of the UFO Study Group of Greater St.Louis was held Sunday, the 21st, at the Lemay Bank & Trust Co., 152 Lemay Ferry Rd., St. Louis, with nearly one hundred persons present. There will be no meeting in November, but the December meeting will be held at' 2 PM Sunday, Dec. 2, at the regular meeting place. Dr. Peter R. Phillips, Professor of Physics at the Washington University in St. Louis, was the guest speaker at the October meeting and discussed representative examples of parapsychological phenomena, psychokinesis, telepathy and the paranormal \"talents\" of Uri Geller and Ted Serios, then answered questions from the audience. John F. Schuessler,.Director of the Group, gave an account of the UFO reports through September and early October, including the Pascagougla, Mississippi, case. Dr. W. P. Armstrong lauded the increased news coverage of UFO reports, citing speci- fically recent programs, interviews, or articles carried by NB C-TV, KMOX radio and the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch.\" Several members of the UFO Study Group were interviewed by Mr. John Moore, a reporter for the newly established bi-weekly jour- nal \"St. Louis Today.\" Our new SKYLOOK reporter, David A. Schroth, who keeps us up to date on St. Louis news, sent us a copy of \"St. Louis Today\" and the Nov. 9-23 edition carried a page and a half of UFO news, featuring recent reports and the work being done by the St. Louis Group and MUFON. By the way, if you noticed Dave wasn't listed on the staff in the November issue, it was because the printer made a mistake and used the old September plate instead of the new one for Octobnr. We are sure Page 1 in this issue will be \"right on.\" Dr. W. P. Armstrong presented an illustrated talk entitled \"UFOs Are Real\" to the Forder School P.T.A in St. Louis, Nov. 2. WIL radio, St. Louis, conducted a number of brief interviews with John Schuessler, Bill Christian. John Preisack, Dennis Hovis and others during the daylight and evening hours of Oct. 31. .

If you think the UFO flap in the southeastern states has subsided, simply turn your attention to Cali- / fornia, which has now attracted the attention of the wire services. Both Idabel Epperson and Paul Cerny are being deluged wit h reports. It-would be impossible to list all of the radio and television program that. MUFON members have participated in from coast to coast during the past month. The great influx of mail is evidence of the public relations effectiveness of these appearances. May we express our appreciation to all of you who either carried the UFO story to the public via electronics or were interviewed by your local news- papers and the national wire services. Walt Andrus Director, MUFON To All Of Our Readers: A warm thank you for your support and cooperation during 1973,- and our very best wishes for Happy Holidays and a true Christmas spirit that will carry over all through 1974.—Your Editor and Staff.
