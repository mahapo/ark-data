MUFON members will pay a combination dues/subscription price of $12 per year, effective Jan. 1, with special provisions for multi- member households and members under the age of 18 (see Director's Message in this issue). Also as announced in the last issue, SKYLOOK will remain a financially independent publication, as it has since 1967, rather than merging com- pletely with MUFON at this time. SKYLOOK will, of course, continue to serve as MUFON's Official Publi- cation, as it has since 1969. Through a series of meetings, both MUFON and SKYLOOK agreed that it would be best to delay the proposed merger, pending completion of organizational changes now underway MUFON is in the process of stream- lining its Board of Directors struc- ture to reflect the extensive growth of the organization, and this process will take a great deal of work and time. It is hoped that the proposed reorganization can be finalized at the 1975 MUFON Symposium meeting in Des Moines, Iowa, in July. As details of the reorganization are decided, SKYLOOK's eventual financial rela- tionship with MUFON can be deter- mined more adequately than at pres- ent, In the meantime SKYLOOK and MUFON will, of course, continue to work as a unit in serving members and readers. Under the new $8.QQ per year sub- scription rate, SKYLOOK will not have much leeway in absorbing -in- creased printing costs, UNLESS suk scriptions rise dramatically in the next few months. Subscriptions have been increasing gradually, out the rate of increase needs to be faster if the pep-unit cost is to be kept in line in these times, of rising costs. We will continue to dp many of the things we would normally expect a commercial printer to do, and this will help, but we need the help of our readers, too. Here is what we are asking you to do; contact your local libraries, both public and school, and request that they subscribe to SKYLOOK. In addi- tion, get ONE other person to sub? scribe, If all our readers would do this (or even a substantial number), the per-unit price would go down dra- matically. Members of UFO groups? who are now sharing copies can help by purchasing individual subscrip- tions (they make nice files and col- lectors' items). A significant increase in subscrip- tions would mean we could hold the line on subscription rates, and prob- ably enlarge and otherwise improve SKYLOOK.

Submitted through Joe Brill, Inter- national Coordinator for MUFON. First phase: Time: 10:35 or 10:40 p.m. Date: July 10,1974. Three girls, Maria Grazia Gandini, Patrizia Cremonesi and Giovanna Ragni, were walking along the street when Giovanna Ragni called the at- tention of her companions to a \"very strange light\" which was moving very quickly through the sky. It had a diameter apparently great- er than that of a star, and its color changed from yellow to reddish- orange. The \"thing\" approached with a right angular diagonal type of di- rection with regard to the earth and with a very wavy type of motion, so that the witnesses had the impression that it had the form of a perfect \"semisphere.\" The \"strange thing\" passed directly over their heads and the girls waved their arms in a sign of greeting and suddenly they observed in the lower section a light go on and off inter- mittently. The flashes of light were very well separated from each other. \"They were like normal lamps . . .\" \"They were of a white yellowish color and very bright,\" the witnesses re- ported. The object slowed in its velocity and made a \"gentle turn\" always in an undulating flight and then again it resumed the right angle turn toward the earth and in departing in a wavy flight disappeared behind a house. After having run along the street a little further, the girls observed more clearly a sort of \"spot of fire\" which shined forth in a field on the horizon. Second Phase: Time: 11:25 p.m. Date: July 10,1974. Giovanna Ragni returned home and reported what she and her friends had seen to her family, and they did not give her story any attention or think it to be of any real importance, but then they went out on the balcony, of their house and all the members of the Ragni family (the father, the mother, Giovanna and her brother Guido) observed in a distant field a very strange thing which was similar to what Giovanna .had reported to all of them. It was a luminous sphere which seemed to hover at a short distance above the ground and emanate a pul- sating light which varied in its in- tensity and in color without ever com- pletely going out. In the moments of great intensity, the light assumed a very strong red, while in the moments of less intensity the color became a clear orange. Guido Ragni, a security policeman, picked up the telephone and called the fire department of Pavia, but he was informed that if he was not speaking of a real fire that was spreading, they could not respond be- cause this affair would not be of their UFO KE(?£ OOOf- 6 F4M .

The policeman returned to the bal- cony and noticed that many other persons were standing and observing this luminous object in the field, from the balconies of nearby houses, but he alone decided to go and investigate for himself at close range'. He asked his sister to go with him. His mother, moved by a protective sense for her son, insisted and also went with them to get a better look at this thing. Third Phase: Time: 11:45 p.m. Date: July 10,1974. These three individuals climbed into their automobile and after leav- ing the main highway they threaded their way along a dirt road which took them into the area that they were interested in, but instead of see- ing the \"luminous object\" they saw nothing but complete darkness. The day had been hot and serene— a typical Italian summer day in July —the moon had already set and the night was dark and perfectly clear. Everything was in order, and in the sky many stars were shining which seemed to smile down ironically, but there were no strange noises heard. Now, rather completely confused, the policeman supposed that all the witnesses, himself included, had been deceived by a very unusual natural phenomena, and after a short while they decided to go back home. But then the mother let out a scream, and Guido turned suddenly to see what it was. There in the field hovering was the same object they had seen from the balcony of their house, shining brilliantly. It was a \"luminous semisphere\" of Two \"very scorched\" areas about ten meters in diameter, flat on its base, part of the object going ver- tically up. Meanwhile, the witnesses were truly frightened and they scram- bled into their car and sped away as fast as possible. The mother observed other particulars: a sort of \"pillow\" of red dust between the base of the object and the ground below it\" and a sort of \"fixed light\" pointed toward the ground in the lower part of the object. They calculated that the UFO was about three hundred meters from them, and they heard no sound nor smelled any odor nor had any other This sketch of the alleged UFO ap- peared in the Aug. 1, 1974, edition of \"Corriere d'lnformazione.\" E-M effects of any kind. Fourth Phase: Time: 00:15 hours. Date: July 11,1974. On returning home, the policeman ,Ragm called the Carabinieri (Italian national police) of Pavia and with them returned to the site. The UFO was no longer there, but they dis- covered a very large trace on the ground formed by the stubbles (the grain had been cut previously by the peasants) which had been burned and scorched in a circular manner, with a whole line of dust and ashes scat- tered on the surface. The traces were many meters from a very dusty road which ran along- side this grain field. The trace had the form of a rectangle (about 30 x 15 meters), with the broad side parallel The electrical power station. to the road. On the other broad'side of the rectangle there were three burnt tracks in the form of triangles point- ing towards Pavia. It should clearly be pointed out that the field where these traces were dis- covered had been sprinkled abundant- ly after the harvesting so that on the 13th of July the ground was still soaked with water, so that, a normal fire was simply impossible. While investigating this sighting, the Carabinieri discovered another trace on the road which bordered on the field. There was a circular im- print of about one and a half meters in diameter (one meter and 50 centi- meters exactly) and very definitly \"fresh,\" according to the Carabinieri. Some newspapers reported that two persons (Mr. Vecchi and his daughter Elda, who live near the landing site) between 11:45 and 00:15 hrs. went into the corn field to extinguish a little fire that was burning. Very near to the landing traces there pass electric power lines, and there is also an electric power cabin directly in front of the burnt trace on the other side of the dirt road. Two very intensely burnt areas ap- peared in the center and the right of the rectangular trace, and also the circular imprint found on the road. All of the witnesses seemed honest and sincere during the interviews. The Commanding Officer of the se- curity police guaranteed the unim- peachable seriousness and alertness of the principal witness, Guido Ragni. —4—"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"California, May 23, 1974 Close-in lighted globe reported By Ann DruHel MUFON Inrestigator This sighting on May 23,1974 involv- ing an unidentified flying object is recounted in detail for three main reasons: •1. The closeness with which the UFO approached the witness; 2. The wealth of detail regarding the UFO as noted by an exceptionally observant and eloquent witness; and 3. The nature of the witness herself and the effect of the UFO upon her which might provide some clues to 'a suspected link between UFO activity and parapsychology. Since the witness, Miss Ethel Berg- man, 64, is exceptionally well-read, educated, and uses very clear and meaningful language, most of the text will be in her own words. The nar- rative has been taken from a .45 .min- ute tape recording made at the scene of the sighting. It is essentially se- quential, but has been edited down to a manageable length: The Sighting \"At 12:57 a.m. (just past midnight) on that day, I stepped out onto my second-story balcony to shake out the drapes. I'm that way. I do things when the mood strikes me. I was banging away at the drapes on the balcony rail, which faces east. I noted that the clouds were very high and thick, but they did not cover the sky. They were torn and ripped, and a lot of dark sky showed between them. \"I had my eyes again on the drapes, when all of a sudden I felt that a bright flashlight was in my eyes. Straight with the line of my vision, right over a red roof on the next block, I saw a bright white light so brilliant that I couldn't see any nearby points in relation to it. The object had me mesmerized immediately, not in the sense that I didn't know what I was doing, but I knew I'd never seen any- thing like it and probably never will again. But it didn't occur to me that it was anything out-of-space until later on. \"It was a perfect circle, and the size seemed to be about the size of a wall there (pointing behind the in- < ' I ' I I t I / / / / / O OOOOOCM3OOO OOOOOOOOOOO \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ O OP • O o of vestigator), or about six to eight feet in diameter. All -I could think of was that they found me there and they thought they'd have some fun. I haven't been out since I've lived here at 1:00 at night. \"It was right in front of me, full size, when I first saw it. The thing that hit me was the two different types of lighting on it. On the top half of the sphere, the inside had a glow like an illuminated milk-globe lamp, but more translucent, really more like a frosted incandescent light bulb. You couldn't see through it — it was like solid incandencent radiation, very in- tense. Diamond-Like \"Then right in the center of the globe, just like a dividing line, were gleaming diamond-like points of light, pinpointing the outside. This very sharp lighting made a contrast with the solid lighted portion above, even compared with the intense glow above. It was like a diamond tiara around the sphere, astonishingly bright. These points seemed to be extra lights coming from the outside. (See Sketch 1) \"This diamond effect must have gone around to the other side. It seemed to encircle the sphere. I can't remember, because of the sharpness of the light, whether the entire bottom of the globe was sprinkled with these —5— diamond light points, or whether the impression of extra outside lights on the rest of the bottom was caused by reflection from the intense band, the tiara effect around the middle. But the entire bottom half was so brilliant that it gave the same effect. \"When the globe was coming at me, it was very slow, even seemed close to hovering at first. I don't remember it growing in size as it came nearer. Its slow speed enabled me to get a good look at it. It was in full close view for about 25 seconds. \"At no time was there any light beamed at me or the surroundings from the thing. It radiated by itself and within itself. It cast no shadows on the ground, at least none I noticed. I was staring at it so intensely I didn't notice anything else around me. At no time did the lights on the ob- ject blink, but the lights around the center gave off sparkles, not in regu- lar rhythm, though. It was rather the irregular dimming and brightening of scintillation, like a diamond, or the sun reflected on water, rather than blinking. It wasn't an on-and-off deal, but a constant scintillation. \"After it approached me, moving east to west, it veered to my right (south) went just over a tree about twenty feet away, and then started leaping up and off southwest at a diagonal. I ran to the corner of the porch because I wanted to see what the back looked like. Naturally I wasn't going to miss anything. Fin Visible \"In the darkness around the ball of light I saw a little fin or fish-tailed thing sticking out from the bottom. (See Sketch 2) I've never been able to figure the exact shape. I saw the shadow of an outline. There was no appurtenance over or under it, just that little protuberance in the rear. \"The fin was darker than the back- ground of the sky, because the sky around here gives off a little sheen from reflected lights of the city. I got a look of about five seconds at the back. On the back, the upper part was not so bright. The glow still came from the center, but the under part of"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"the globe still reflected the same scintillating kind of glow, only not so bright as on the front of the thing. The glow was enough, however, to make a shadow out of the fin-shaped thing. \"I didn't see exactly where the fin was.attached. It could have been up „ into the body of the thing and stick- ing out from beyond the perimeter. That doesn't mean that it couldn't have been stuck on up on the body, only that the light prevented me from seeing it among the glare. If I had to choose a color for the fin, I'd say it was dark brown. No Sound \"Lwas fascinated by it. There was no sound at all. I have unusually good hearing, being able to detect, the low- est and highest sounds audible to the human ear, according to audiometer tests I've had. In fact, even ordinary noise bothers me, like my landlord . handling lumber or hammering in the back yard. \"The oddest thing of all was the way it disappeared. It leaped up into the southwest sky and disappeared. When it took off, it was so fast it was gone in the blink of an eye. It never got up into the clouds. My impression was that it disappeared maybe like it went into another dimension and became invisible. You saw it, and then it disappeared and it was gone! \"I'm mystified about how I saw it come down so low. I never actually saw it go behind or in front of any- thing, but it seemed to be maneuvered in order to avoid bumping into the wires and trees in the back yard. In fact, I thought it was going to land in the back yard! \"I saw it certainly no less than thirty seconds, and it seemed as long as a minute. Not only do you lose track of time, but you're just in a dif- ferent mood when you see something like that. You're not thinking of the passage of time, you're thinking that here's something you've never seen before and you're concentrating on observing it. \"It certainly wasn't more than a block away when it came upon me, this I am certain. Look at the timing! It's a funny thing for me to do, shak- ing out dust from curtains at that hour of the night, but the thought just occurred to me I'd better do it while . I had a few minutes because I might ftff- forget to do it in the morning. It's not like I was going out looking at the sky, even. \"It was like Jung calls synchro- nicity. It can't be coincidence, be- cause I'll probably never again see anything like that so close. It aimed straight at me, and then when it came close, it veered right off.\" Viewing Angles After the interview, angles were ob- tained by the investigator from the places on the porch where the object was viewed. The object was first seen at 80 degrees azimuth, and was at 200 degrees azimuth when it disappeared. When first seen it was at five degrees elevation, and seventeen degrees ele- vation at disappearance. At its closest point east to west toward Mrs. Bergman, it was seven- teen degrees elevation, and main- tained that elevation as it passed above a tree by her garage some twenty feet from the southeast corner of her porch, traveled through the southern sky, and finally disappeared at seventeen degrees elevation in the southwest.  . It is about nine feet from the spot where Mrs. Bergman was shaking her drapes to the corner of the porch where she moved quickly to see the back of the object. We reenacted the entire sighting to obtain an estimate of its duration. It came to between 27- 30 seconds. The angles indicated that the ob- ject, in relation to her, was just above a telephone wire some twenty feet from the porch due east, but of course we have only her own judgment that —6— the object was, in fact, really that close to her. The same applies to her judgment that the object passed 'above the nearby tree. The fact that she did not at any time notice it growing in size as it \"moved toward her\" indicates to me that- it was, in actuality, very close. Its failure to grow in size hints that it was much nearer to her than a block away (400 feet) when first seen, even though it seemed to her that it was over a red roof on the next block when she first saw it. The sensation of its moving nearer was doubtless caused by its moving from five degrees elevation to seven- ' teen degrees elevation during its \"slow approach.\" Did the object, in fact, \"materialize\" close to her, just * as it seemed to \"dematerialize\" at its disappearance? The object subtended an angle of about two degrees arc. She compared it to the size of a small bottle cap held at arm's length, after searching through her house for an adequate comparison, since the investigator's usual comparison objects, aspirin, dime, penny, quarter, etc., did not suit her. The bottle cap is about one and one-half inch diameter (3.8 centi- meters). The great apparent size, the wit- ness' unshakeable belief of closeness, and the fact that at no time did it pass behind any of the many available ref- erence points in and around the yard give credence to the possibility that the object was, indeed, very close, perhaps on the order of twenty feet away. These points also give credence to the possibility that the object was, as the witness thinks, maneuvering about the yard and house (and around I 1 ' her?). The tree over which it seemed to ? pass had branches reaching up to • about fifteen degrees elevation. There was no evidence of burned branches, wilted leaves, etc., on this tree.

She states before the incident she had never given thought to UFOs be- fore. She was very skeptical about stories she'd heard, but now that she has seen an unidentified flying object herself, she accepts them as real. She states that she has trouble wearing a watch (a fact that seems to crop up from time to time among UFO witnesses).

She has no- ticed, too, that electrical appliances in her home have abnormally short use-lives.

Parapsychological Aspects Toward the end of the interview, the investigator on impulse asked Miss Bergman if she considers her- self \"psychic.\" She unhesitatingly re- plied that she did. She told of having gone through an \"awakening of grace\" in 1947, and since that time she has realized that life is not a quest for personal success or comfort but rather a period of opportunity for one's personal spiritual development. She considers herself Jewish but doesn't practice any orthodox re- ligion. She accepts Christ as her spiritual leader. She feels that she is \"an old soul,\" one which has lived other lives before in its quest for per- sonal development. She speculates that the object might possibly have found her differ- ent, not only because of her effect on electrical equipment, but also be- cause of her concentration on psychic and spiritual development. She felt that the object \"had an existence in another dimension,\" but temporarily appeared to her eyes in a physical state for whatever its reasons might be. She commented that since the spir- itual or psychic world is of a vibra- tory rate different from the physical universe, there might be some con- nection.' She was entirely free of a prideful manner. She spoke of the possible psychic connection only when di- rectly asked by the investigator, giv- ing answers to specific questions. She was as objective in her manner discussing the psychic factors as she was in her straightforward descrip- tion of the sighting. Investigator Druffel points out the similarities between the Bergman sighting and the sighting by Darrel Nickels in Oklahoma on Nov. 30, 1973 (May, 1974, Skylook). Meteorological and wind conditions for the day and time of sighting indi- cate that the object was traveling counter to the flow of wind.

(Von Daniken has become a mod- ern phenomenon; his theory, a world- wide fad. In America, Playboy maga- zine said recently, \"Von Daniken ranks in popularity ... somewhere be- tween the streaking and the exorcism craze. 'Chariots' is in its 44th paper- back printing, with U.S. sales esti- mated at 5,000,000 copies.\") Both in a book titled, \"Some Trust in Chariots\" (Popular Library: New York; 128 pp., 95$), and in a cutting interview in Playboy magazine (August, 1974), the \"evidence\" sup- porting the ancient-astronaut hypoth- esis is dismantled to what some critics believe to be an irreparable degree. One scholar who has followed the Von Daniken controversy, Dr. Alvin H. Lawson, professor of English at the California State University at Long Beach, is conducting studies into the logic and semantics of the UFO (un- identified-f lying-object) debate as part of a course in UFO literature he —Photo by Dwight Connelly Eric Von Daniken was a featured member of a discussion panel at the first conference of the Ancient As- tronaut Society last summer in Chicago. is now teaching. \"Playboy demolished Von Daniken,\" Lawson said to me recently. Prior to reading the Playboy inter- view last week, I had discovered \"Some Trust,\" a compilation from Australia of authoritative analyses of Von Daniken's \"Chariots.\" Salient statements from \"Some Trust\" fol- low: —A.D. Crown, senior lecturer, De- partment of Semitic Studies, Univer- sity of Sydney: \"There can be little doubt that a group of responsible scholars drawing on their training can demolish the arguments put for- ward by Von Daniken in his 'Chariots of the Gods?', for there is barely a statement in the book which will stand scrutiny.\" —Colin Gauld, lecturer in Science Education, University of New South Wales: \"Von Daniken makes some remarkable statements about specu- lation which he openly contradicts in other sections . . . This inconsistency borders on academic dishonesty!\" —Professor Basil Hennessy, visit- ing professor of Near Eastern Ar- chaeology, University of Sydney; for- mer director, British School of Ar- chaeology, Jerusalem: \"Von Dani- ken's 'non-existent' rope (used to con- struct the Great Pyramid in Egypt) —8— . . . can be seen in quantities in the Cairo and other museums . . .

And \"Some Trust\" contains numerous concrete objections to Von Daniken's views. Playboy interviewer Timothy Fer- ris asked Von Daniken, at one point during their three-day talk, for his strongest evidence that astronauts"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"landed on Earth in ancient times. In reply, Von Daniken cited a stone carv- ing in Yucatan that allegedly shows an astronaut piloting a rocket. \"— at his nose he has what I would call an oxygen mask,\" said Von Dani- ken. \"He is operating some controls with his hands, turning something on—you can recognize every detail— and the heel of his left foot seems to be on a pedal which has different adjustments. Behind him you see some circles, some boxes, all kinds of mysterious things. And outside is a flame like an exhaust.\" Aztec specialist Gordon Whittaker, however, points out that a quetzal bird (the national bird of Guatemala) is perched on the nose of Von Dani- ken's \"rocket.\" \"But then,\" Whittaker continues, \"Von Daniken does not mention the rather distasteful skull with the big fangs pictured below the astronaut's seat either. Nordoes he mention the life-expectancy of the astronaut, who is sticking his head outside the rocket. \"And now that I think about it, the astronaut must have taken his trendy jacket off, since all I can see is a necklace and ornament on his chest.

Jackson, MUFON Research Associate, The Tasmanian UFO Investigation Cen- tre. Submitted by: Joe Brill, International Coordinator. It was a lucky day for the Tasman- ian UFO Investigation Centre when Roger Brooks, a senior English Mas- ter and Garry Bensemann sighted a UFO at Scamander on Aug. 30, 1974. Their meticulous notes on the sight- ing resulted in one of the best docu- mented reports to the Centre. About 10:20 p.m. the two men were out walking a dog on Scamander beach when the dog became excit- able; it was then they noticed what looked to be a bright aircraft light, estimated to be Vz a mile out over the sea to the southeast. After watching the light moving erratically for 10 minutes and realiz- ing it wasn't a plane, Brooks tele- phoned the Hobart Airport; they in turn gave him the Centre's telephone number. Sightings Officer Ken Bennetto was able to give Brooks hints on how to observe the strange light and the two witnesses then formed a simple rec- tangle with sticks driven into the sand. Watching the light, they logged its flight path. The UFO darted at strange angles around the sky, hovered, altered speed and flashed colored lights. The UFO had been moving vaguely north and was due east of the wit- nesses by 10:45 p.m. Then it started to move steadily south along the coast so the witnesses rushed to their car. They drove some 8 or 9 miles south of Scamander, keeping the UFO in sight. However, it was moving faster than they were, and became fainter; by 11:30 p.m. it looked like a moving star and at 12:15 a.m. disappeared into increasing clouds. Description of UFO The UFO was mainly composed of lights. The brightest, a pale yellow, was shaped like a sharp dome; be- neath that, green, pink, and occasional white and pale blue light moved from left to right around what appeared to be a disc like an unturned plate. This lower part did not appear solid, but rather was an area of light. Its apparent size was about one- sixteenth moon sized; at Vz a mile this could roughtly be a width of at least 20 ft. plus. The light from the object did not make shafts in the sky, but rather twinkled brightly. Clouds began to appear some half hour after the object was first sighted; Jupiter and the stars went dim, but not the UFO—only when it disappeared south into the increasing cloud did it fade about 11:50 p.m. It was seen again just after midnight very distant before going into clouds again after some 12 minutes. Movements In relation with St. Patricks head to the south, the UFO appeared to be the same height of around 1,600 feet: The light was first seen to the southeast and came northward initially. When it was moving in a darting, hovering pattern the witnesses set up their rectangle of sticks. There was no circular or curved flight noticed. At times it moved at slow steady car speed, then the speed of a fast car, and at other times like the speed of an aircraft on take off. When it was stationary it would re- main in the one position for some 10 to 20 seconds before moving on. When it travelled away to the south gaining elevation, it did so steadily but at an increasing speed. Conclusions Scamander is over 150 miles from Hobart, situated on the state's east coast, being only 35 miles as the crow flies southeast of Gladstone. The re- port certainly fits in well with the UFO Flap from the North East and a further sighting at St. Marys soon after.. Checks with DCA proved that there were no aircraft in the sighting area, while our astronomical adviser dis- counted satellites. The brightest as- tronomical object, Jupiter, was noted — 10— by the witnesses at the time of the sighting. The weather tallied with witnesses' descriptions, being fine at first with increasing clouds later. No one else viewed the UFO, most people being in bed at the time. Family'buzzed/ Shocked by UFO Investigator: Mr. R. Brooks.  f : Sent to Joe M. Brill, International ' Coordinator, by Paul Jackson, Cor- ' respondence Officer, Tasmanian UFO • Investigation Center. Date of Sighting: Sept. 16, 1974. Location: Near St. Helens, Tas- mania, Australia. Since May, northeast Tasmania has seen cars followed, hunters ap- proached, and brilliant low level UFO's, but on the night of Sept. 16 the UFO came south to the St. Marys area a number of miles inland from the Aug. 30 case at Scamander. The sighting was headlined in the Hobart \"Mercury\" of Sept. 21 under, \"UFO's BUZZED FAMILY.\" The pa- per told the story of the Richards fam- ily being terrorized by a UFO. Fol- lowing up the paper story revealed the location of the sighting was in fact on the Anson's Bay Road four to five miles north of St. Helens, a small port 12 miles north of Scamander. The sighting area is only 20 miles southeast of the Gladstone district. Mrs. A. Richards of \"The Marshes,\" t about 12 miles north of St. Helens, was returning home from Launceston ,. .with her two children, Janine (8 yrs. ,j old) and Kathleen (5 yrs. old). After stopping at her sister-in-law's, Mrs. Richards continued on home. Kath- leen, by now being very tired, went to sleep. The car at this stage was run- ning well. Mr. R. Brooks of Scamander, an English teacher, visited the witness on behalf of TUFOIC and we are in- debted to him for the following nar- rative.   - Sequence of Events It was dark with light drizzle when Mrs. Richards approached a bridge"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"series of 1974 UFO sightings on Ansons Bay Road approximately four to five miles north of St. Helens. She noticed that the car radio went static. Previously there had been good reception and she hadn't noticed this trouble before. Following the radio going static, the sky marked by the witness' field of vision ahead was lighted brightly. As the car crossed the bridge it lost power on a gentle incline, then stopped dead and all the lights of the car went out: headlights, radio, heat- er, and dashboard — total darkness except for the light in the sky. Mrs. Richards tried to start the car, but after ten seconds a deafening vibrating noise enveloped the car \"like 30 to 40 large jets. I felt my head was splitting oepn. I thought the world was coming to an end,\" said Mrs. Richards. The noise forced her io cover her ears. Kathleen was still asleep, but Janine said the sound was \"deafen- ing.\" Almost simultaneously, quite painful electric shocks began pene- trating their bodies—like electric vi- brations, far worse than a shock from an electric kettle. (Mrs. Richards guessed about 400 to 500 volts). This all lasted for about a minute, during which she thinks she screamed. A Choking Gas Then the car was filled by an in- visible smell—a penetrating gas, far stronger than commercial bottled gas, and nothing recognizable. Janine smelt it too and both leaped out of the car for air. \"All I wanted was fresh air and to breathe properly,\" said Mrs. Richards. They dragged Kathleen, who was dazed, half awake, from the car and fled down the road. By this time there was only light in the sky. Around 9:45 p.m. they reached the house of Mr. H. Chappel, about two miles from the car. Mr. Chappel was .alarmed by Mrs. Richards' uncon- trolled state. He returned with his brother and Mrs. Richards to the car and there was no sign of any light. The car started faultlessly although there was little water in the radiator. Mr. Chappel is a mechanic, and at that time could find nothing wrong with the car except a hot hood- probably the radiator had boiled. Mrs. Richards finally continued on home. Husband Second Witness At the time of the experience Mr. Richards, who was waiting at home, saw lights in the sky and heard a dis- tant roar. He though it was his wife driving along the farm road and took little notice, expecting her to arrive at any minute. He was surprised when the car did not come over the hill. Car Checked The next day a St. Helens garage proprietor, Mr. G. Stone, examined the car thoroughly and could find nothing wrong; the radio worked and the electrical system was in working order. After Effects on Witness The day after the event, Mrs. Richards' arms and fingers were badly swollen and she had difficulty in walking. She had a numb right face and a red mark (2 cent size) above her right eyebrow. She claims she did not bruise herself, but that the vibra- tions did it. Despite-tranquillizers the witness' nerves have been in a poor state since the incident. Mrs. Richards consulted a doctor, who felt she was suffering from severe emotional reaction. The children suffered no after effects. Mrs. Richards says her greatest frustrations have come from trying to convince people of what happened. She has never had any form of men- tal disorder or delusions. She doesn't drink'and has not been sick. Investigator's Conclusions ' Mrs. Richards was badly shaken by the occurrence, and though some de- tails might have become confused, she has genuinely.been frightened by something. She says, \"I ,am hardly likely to make up a story like this, why should I?\" People the investiga- tor spoke with described the witness as sane, healthy, hard working, and sincere, and' were emphatic that this was not a made up story. — 11 — UFO straightens woman's hair This Report sent to Joe M. Brill, International Coordinator, by Paul B. Jackson, MUFON Research Asso- ciate for Tasmania, The Tasmanian UFO Investigation Center. It was raining with mist on the mountains when Mrs. W. (name on file with SKYLOOK and the TUFOIC) parked 200 yards from the junction of the Tayene and Diddleum Plains roads late on the afternoon of Sept. 22,1974. The area is roughtly 30 miles northeast of Launceston, Tasmania, Australia. She was waiting for a relative to arrive. Owing to the steep bank on the left side of the road, she parked on the wrong side to ensure that log trucks using the road would see the car on the narrow road. Mrs. W. heard over the car radio that the time was 5:20 p.m., then all of a sudden the whole area lit up, the bright light penetrating the interior of the car, and at the same time the radio developed a very high pitched whistle. The witness leaned over, intending to turn the radio off. In this position she could see up the hill on the left side of the road and noticed at once a glowing orange and silver object coming between two grees and down the hill towards the road. The object was moving slowly and appeared the size of a large car. It was 15 to 20 meters high and drop- ping down towards the road. . Mrs. W. now panicked and started her car and backed up the road. The UFO kept approaching until it was at fence top height in the middle of the road, about 20 to 30 meters away, as estimated the witness. The car radio was still emitting a piercing noise. After backing up the road some 100 yards, she backed over the edge and the car stuck. The UFO now became stationary tor about 60 seconds in front of the witness. Mrs. W. was very frightened and found that the glae from the dome-shaped top of the ob-"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"ject made it hard to discern the upper portion of the object. After hovering briefly, the UFO dipped over to the right and moved away from the road over a .valley area alongside the road (to the south- west, after coming initially Irom the southeast). It then went straight up farily fast and was lost from the wit- ness' field ol vision. Mrs. W's nerve- shattering experience had lasted three to tour minutes. Mrs. W. was very shaken by the incident and was sick for a number of days with nervous tension. Her fresh- ly permed hair turned straight alter the encounter with the UFO. Mrs. W, did not believe in UFO's prior to the sighting, although her husband did. Her relatives said she should report the sighting. It would appear the presence of the UFO affected the car's radio. Before the sighting it was claimed to be in perfect working order, but has suf- fered from distortion since. The next day when the car was towed home it was noticed how ex- ceptionally clean the front of the car was. although the rest was still dirty. Previously there had been cat foot- prints all over the hood, but the front was cleaned as though given a good cut and polish. Neither the witness nor her husband felt it was possible for the hood to be cleaned by the rain of the previous day while the rest of the car was so dirty. The UFO was domed on top, but Mrs. W. found it hard to see details because of the intense orange/yellow light that it gave off. The. witness therefore found it hard to give an estimate on the size of the dome. Beneath the dome the UFO was silvery/grey, with a wider brim on which the witness thought there could have been portholes. Below were 6 to reversed stepped bands estimated to be about five feet in depth. The ob- ject's width was some twelve feet. At the base in the center was a small revolving disc, and below this a protruding box or tube of short length. The tube object appeared to split into four sections as the UFO sped,off. The sighting was initially reported to the Royal Australian Air Force. They could find no explanation for gmur CONGE-rail* , HARD D DISCERN. AFF&OED T& SEWXRATE INTO 4- SECTIONS IT MOVED OFF. this daylight sighting. The RAAF did not visit the sighting area, but inter- viewed the witness by telephone. The Center's Northern Representa- tive, John C. Dean, visited the sighting area and checked the surrounding ground for any marks or magnetic variations. Nothing was found. Mrs. W. was still disturbed by the incident when Dean called to see her two weeks after the encounter. The car was not available for inspection at the time. Explanations such as weather bal- loons, aircraft, helicopters, and meteorlogical phenomena were all ruled out, leaving us with a good low level daylight sighting. It is interesting to compare the report with the \"automobile stop\" near St. Helens six days earlier and about 30 miles to the east. Ancient Astronauts' conference The Second World Conference on Ancient Astronauts .will be held in Zurich, Switzerland, on May 29, 30, 31, 1975, at the Hotel Movenpick-Holiday Inn. The admission price is $25 per person. The conference is sponsored by the Ancient Astronaut Society. Thus far, the list of speakers in- cludes Erich Von Daniken, Jacques Bergier, Louis Pauwels, Jean Sendy, Peter Krassa, Baron Johannes Von Buttlar, Peter Doberer, Dr. Adolf Schneider, Frede Melhedegaard, Josef Blumrich, and Dr. Luis Navia. SWISSAIR will make arrangements for a group flight which will leave Chicago O'Hare at 6:45 p.m. on Tues- day, May 27. The flight may also stop in Boston to pick up passengers. The exact price has not been determined, but it will be approximately $625 per person, including round trip air fare from Chicago to Zurich, four nights at Hotel Movenpick (based upon single occupancy room), and the Con- ference ticket. Depending upon the number of pas- sengers, the group may spend either two or three weeks in Europe, with participants on their own after the Conference, or a part of an escorted bus tour through Switzerland, Austria and Germany, depending on the de- sires of the group.

Within a short time after I became involved in this, particular area of re- search, I.started to feel pressure of disbelief of the events from a few in the general public and several re- spected UFO researchers. This is something that I would expect from an uninformed citizen who might be ignorant of the UFO subject, but I am quite disturbed at the attitude of the UFOlogists. . An open mind I have always -learned, as a very active UFO investigator, to go into all cases with an open mind, no matter how strange the circumstances might be. Just because 'a case you confront might be unique to you as an investi- gator, that doesn't mean that a simi- lar event didn't occur somewhere else in the world. In many cases that I have been in- volved in, it wasn't until years after the initial investigation that another incident of almost identical detail was reported. I also have learned that a good researcher doesn't give an opinion on a case until he has person- ally made an attempt to learn all the details of the incident, and properly evaluate the findings. I now find myself in a position which some UFOlogists occupied a number of years ago when they ex- pressed their beliefs that three-foot tall humanoid-like creatures accom- panied some UFO vehicles. Since none of these small humanoids have ever been captured, this belief was primarily based on the numerous worldwide sightings of such crea- tures. Today the majority of UFOlogists accept the possibility that these hu- manoids do exist, but only after more of these encounters were brought to light. The problem of disbelief from both the public and UFOlogists seem to be a combination of two factors: psychology and politics. Families changed In regard to the psychological fac- tor of the, Bigfoot incidents, I have found in many cases, particularly in the family lives of the creature wit- nesses, that their normal personality pattern was drastically changed be- cause their loved ones refused to be- lieve that they could have seen such a creature. I know of one case where the daughter of a doctor had seen a creature, and upon telling this to her father, he became enraged and nearly threw her out of the house. I am familiar with a number of cases of parents who have punished their children when they continued to insist that they had seen a \"Bigfoot.\" There were several families nearly broken up by divorce due to the fact that one of the mates refused to be- lieve the other's encounter. It seems as though humans have made up their minds. that if such things aren't supposed to exist, then they can't. The second factor that I mentioned seems to be primarily that when an incident is reported that doesn't fit the basic ideas or patterns which have been accepted by ah individual as fact, then this person tries to tear apart the event as being untrue, even though in most cases little attempt has been made to investigate the oc- currence. Or else the knowledge of the event is purposely forgotten in order not to interfere with his present theories. Very little research As I stated before, the most critical problem in regard to the Bigfoot-UFO cases is that very little research is being conducted into this area of UFOlogy. In most cases, a researcher upon hearing of a Bigfoot report, nor- mally doesn't investigate further, thinking that there is no UFO tie-in. What must be stressed is that even though the creatures which have been in some cases observed with a UFO look almost identical physically to the Bigfoot or Sasquatcb, THEY ARE -13- NOT THE SAME SPECIES. This is the most important item to remember. The news media has been responsible in most cases for calling these creatures \"Bigfoot,\" since they look so similar. At this time the only major difference that really sep- arates the Earth-type Bigfoot and the creatures connected with the UFO's is that the latter have only three toes. This factor has shown up throughout the country. Reports widespread Just within the past few months, a handful of other researchers have begun to look into this data, and they are uncovering the same exact type of incidents in their locales. Reports of these creatures have again in- creased in Pennsylvania. We also have reports from many other states, including New York, Illinois, Tennes- see, and California, where these same types of events are occurring. • As I have mentioned in past ar- ticles, and as I will discuss in future reports, there appears to be a great amount of psychic phenomena and psychological changes which have oc- curred to some of those involved in these incidents. These cases should be studied by not only scientists and an- thropologists, but by psychiatrists and psychologists as well. At this office we are presently do- ing a massive study of large hairy ape-like creatures from throughout the world, and we are hoping to come up with some answers. If any re- searchers have any cases of these types of sightings on file, particularly cases involving these creatures and UFO's seen at the same time, I would appreciate it if you would send a copy of the report to me to compare to other cases. I am convinced that this particular area of UFOlogy is the most important aspect of the phe- nomena that has ever been uncov- ered.

His name is Felix Y. Zigel and at present he is an Assistant Professor at the Moscow Aviation Institute. He is a Candidate of Physico-Mathemat- ical Sciences and he graduated from the Moscow University in 1942. He re- ceived his Candidate Degree in as- tronomy at the USSR Academy of Sciences in 1948. On May 17, 1967, a group of well- known and respected Russian scien- tists met in Moscow to form an un- official body whose purpose it would be to conduct a preliminary scientific investigation of Unidentified Flying Objects. In October of that same year a com- mittee was set up with the title of the UFO Section of the All-Union Cos- monautics Committee, and a retired Air Force Major General was elected as the chairman. This chairman was Major General Porfiri Stolyarov. Dr. Zigel was elected as the deputy chair- man of this committee, and he agreed to serve at this position as he was anxious to see that this subject was at last receiving the attention he thought it so rightfully deserved. Then on Nov. 10, 1967, General Stolyarov and Dr. Zigel appeared on Moscow Central Television to an- nounce the creation of this new De- partment of UFO's of the All-Union Committee on Cosmonautics of the DOSAAF (Equal to the Department of Defense), and asked the viewers who had observed UFO's to send in a report of their sightings to this newly- formed department. The conse- quences of this appearance proved to be unexpected. Hundreds of reports came in, telling of Soviet citizens' sightings of what appeared to them to be UFO's. At the end of November the DOSAAF Central Committee under the chairmanship of Army General A. L. Getman adopted and passed a resolution on the dissolution of the Department on UFO's. None of the members of the Stolyarov Committee were invited to this session, which called for the dissolution of this new department, nor were any of the members ever informed as to the cause for this decision by the DOSAAF. It was done without their knowledge or involvement. An article entitled \"Again Flying Saucers\" was published in Pravda on Feb. 29, 1968. This article was auth- ored by several members of the USSR Academy of Sciences who were ob- viously misinformed and unversed on Ihe UFO subject. Their article pre- sented a very poor excuse for an ex- planation of the entire UFO pheno- menon, but it was stated with much authority and prestige, and they were not seeking any debates or opposing opinions on the matter. The question was settled that UFO's did not exist. At least to those authors and in the Soviet Union that is all that is neces- sary. However, many reports had been received from that initial television appearance, and several well-written articles on the subject by Dr. Zigel were published in Soviet magazines and these could be valuable if placed in the proper hands. None of the re ported observations were vere scien- tifically investigated by the Soviet authorities. So, in March of 1968 Dr. Zigel began the tedious job of sifting and sorting out these reports that had been sent in, and then began to type out these reports so that they would not be lost to posterity. In the end, this work consisted of 200 typewritten pages of Russian, with some 250 observations. Most of these reports were of bright lights, but there were some very excellent reports that if lost would have made — 14— the entire effort fruitless. However, the reports were assem- bled in manuscript form by Dr. Zigel and titled \"Sightings of UFO's Over the USSR\" Vol. 1.1 had supposed that there was a hope for a Vol. 2, and I had heard from a few sources that such a Work did exist, but to date all my efforts to secure it have resulted in ought. In several of the reports, photographs were taken of the objects in question but none of these photo- graphs were included with the docu- ment. Had Dr. Zigel not had the insight to take the time required to perform this work we would never have known about these UFO sightings at all. Be- cause he did take this time to do what he believed was necessary, and hoped that someday this information might find its' way into the proper hands of those who could judge its worth by its content, we have at least some idea of the sort of reports that have been made there. Through many months of inquiry and requests (with no assistance from any Soviet official offices, pub- lications, or individual officials), I secured a copy of this rare document in its entirety. Another year passed before it was completely translated into English. And now it is finished, and now it will be revealed to the pub- lic that this document exists and was assembled by Dr. Zigel in the hope that serious UFO researchers every- where could benefit by his effort to record what was reported to the Rus- sian UFO Committee in 1967. Dr. Zigel is to be commended for his foresight and courage in recording these observations, knowing that the Soviet government would never allow such a document to be published there in his own country. He has also con- tinued to encourage his government to initiate a serious study of this problem. For the next several months I am going to select some of the better reports from this manuscript of Dr."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Bright object damages car By Stan Gordon At 7:50 p.m. on Oct. 12,1974, Mr. and Mrs. Eugene Loyal were resting in the living room of their mobile home outside of Connellsville, Pa. Mrs. Loyal noticed a bright orange glow coming from the curtained window in her den, and ran to the window to open the drapes, thinking that there was a fire outside toward the front of their residence. When they were opened, an area of about 40 feet was drenched in a bright orange color. The couple's 1969 Grand Prix was parked within the glowing area. Mrs. Loyal then yelled to her hus- band that there was a burning orange object just above the tree moving toward their trailer. The couple went out onto the porch and watched the object move in a straight line toward a wooded area. When the object was in the distance if'didn't appear to be burning. The next morning the couple was leaving for church when they noticed that their newly painted black car had dozens of small burned holes, with a white material around them, all over the body. They also noticed pieces of a white ash material in their yard scatterd about. The couple then notified the state police. The WCUFOSG Control Center then contacted the Loyal's and asked per- Zigel's so that SKYLOOK readers and the general public will fully realize that Russia has had her equal share of unusual encounters with UFO's over her own territory. UFO's are not any highly-secret Russian aircraft or weapon as many people would like to believe, and the accounts forth- coming will prove that beyond ques- tion. Beginning with the February, 1975, issue of SKYLOOK I will be quoting directly from Dr. Zigel's paper, and I know that all of those who have won- dered what has been seen in Russia over the years will find these ac- counts most interesting and educa- tional. Thank you, Dr Zigel, for your time and the courage to state your case in defense of the existence of the UFO phenomenon, whatever it mifht be. mission to investigate the sighting, A six-member field team arrived at the location that afternoon. Radiation readings were first taken, which showed only normal background read- ings. It had rained during the night, so if there was any abnormal levels it probably would have been reduced by then. ' The team then interviewed the wit- nesses, took photos, made measure- ments, and took samples of the resi- due on the car and on the ground. The team members found the white ash on the roof of the trailer where it had discolored the aluminum paint. Also, samples of the residue were located for about a 400-foot area into the yards of other residents in the trailer park. It was noticed that insects that came in contact with the material on the car would struggle and would die in a short time. Further interviews with the wit- nesses revealed that the object was about 30 feet away from the trailer and about 50 feet high when first ob- served. The object itself was a very bright orange and appeared to be about 3 feet in size. No definite shape could be determined, but it appeared to be more elongated than round. No sound or smell was detected by the witnesses, and they didn't observe anything fair from the object. The object was moving from SW to NE. No TV or radio interference was noted, and the witnesses dog did not act abnormal during the incident. On Oct. 14, consultants to the WCUFOSG ran a chemical analysis on the material and found it to be magnesium oxide. This material is commonly found in flares. Magne- sium, however, normally is bright white in color when burning. Further investigation is being made into the case. The possibility exists that some- one -could have tied some flares to a balloon; however, there are several aspects to the case which are not easily explained. UFO Literature course Prof. A. H.

Most of the material was reprinted from ANCIENT SKIES, the bi-monthly newsletter of the Ancient Astronaut Society. The Dec. 15 TATTLER contained two UFO-related articles; actor Charles Pitts told of his underwater sighting of a \"submarine\"-type UFO, and Salt Lake City barber/Ufologist James Wardle received some well-deserved publicity. Wardle has an outstanding collection of UFO literature and photos. The January issue of SAGA has another article on possible links be- tween UFOs and Bigfoot. Interesting, but rather speculative. The Winter issue of SAGA'S UFO REPORT is now out and contains the usual amount of intriguing material. SAGA is also issuing a UFO ANNUAL, con- sisting of reprints from various issues of the UFO REPORT, as well as one new article, columns on Ufological topics, etc. This will sell for $1.00 and will be available in January. The January issue of STAG and the February issue of MALE contain UFO articles. To my mind, the STAG article is highly questionable. The MALE piece is just rehash of a re- cent ENQUIRER article on sightings at Calvert, Texas, with a fictional occupant case thrown in. Readers might like to know that FLYING SAUCER REVIEW has again changed its address. The new address is: P.O. Box 25 — Barnet — Herts. ENS 2NR, England. Current subscription rates for FSR (sea-mail) are $7.50 for 6 issues and well worth the price. Jacques Vallee's second book, CHALLENGE TO SCIENCE, has re- cently been reprinted in paperback by Ballantine Books. This edition con- tains material not found in the pre- vious paperback edition from Ace Books. Vallee's ANATOMY OF A PHENOMENON is also scheduled to be reprinted by Ballantine shortly. Two recent paperbacks are W. R. Drake's GODS AND SPACEMEN OF THE ANCIENT PAST and Robert Charroux's MASTERS OF THE WORLD. Reviews of these titles will appear in future columns. John Michell's first book, THE FLYING SAUCER VISION, has re- cently been reprinted in a British paperback edition by Sphere Books Ltd. — 30-32 Gray's Inn Road — Lon- don WC1X 8JL, England. Michell was one of the first writers to examine myths, legends and other historical material in a search for UFO-related data. The present edition contains a new introduction, but in other re- spects, is unchanged from the origi- nal. It also includes the photographs which were omitted from the Ace Books paperback edition. Well worth reading, it is available from the above address for $2.00. A very good booklet by Loren E. Gross, THE UFO WAVE of 1896, is currently available. This is not an all- inclusive accounting of the California \"airship\" sightings of 1896, but it is as complete a summary as has yet been published. Gross does omit some con- tactee accounts from the airship era, but the booklet is still a very good value for $1.00. Copies may be ob- tained from the author at: 38675 Paseo Padre No. 305 — Fremont, Cal- ifornia 94536. UFO'S: A SCIENTIFIC DEBATE, edited by Carl Sagan and Thornton Page, is now available in a paperback edition from W. W. Norton & Co., Inc. — 55 Fifth Ave. - N.Y., N.Y. 10003. The price is $3.95. It may not be very objective to say that the only portions of this book worth^ reading are the -16- pro-UFO papers by Dr. Hynek, the late Dr. McDonald and others. How- ever, that pretty well sums up my opinion of this collection of writings on the UFO subject. Everyone, of course,.is entitled to an opinion on UFOs, but only those persons who have conducted actual research into the subject are entitled to an in- formed opinion. The majority of the scientists whose papers are included in this volume have not talked to UFO witnesses or made other on-the-spot investigations. Therefore, for all their supposed \"expertise,\" their opinions are worth no more than those of the average man in the street. I would also suggest that the book is some- what misnamed. This was a \"debate by scientists,\" not 'a \"scientific de- bate.\" There is usually a vast differ- ence between the two. Volume 2 of William R. Corliss' STRANGE PHENOMENA is now available from him (Box 107 — Glen Arm, MD 21057) for $6.95. As with the first volume in this series, the current offering is definitely worth your at- tention. A variety of \"Fortean\" phenomena from many sources are included. Charles Berlitz's new book, THE BERMUDA TRIANLE, is currently a very hot item in the bookstores. It has been in the \"top 10\" non-fiction best-sellers in recent weeks. The book contains the usual amount of familiar material, but it also includes some accounts which have not been well- publicized previously. Various peo- ple who have \"escaped\" whatever forces supposedly lurk in the Triangle area have told of very strange phe- nomena. A number of UFO sightings are also discussed in the book. Ber- litz draws no firm conclusions, but includes speculations on space visi- tors, Atlantean power plants, extra- dimensional visitations, etc. Well illustrated with photos and drawings, THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE is cer- tainly worth reading.

The UFO apparently transmitted what P.S.I, researchers feel was the \"mathematical inverse\" of their coded \"Pi\" (3.14...). Project personnel are now install- ing at the research site a sophisti- cated laser-telescope device capable of providing complex light transmis- sion to, and light reception from, UFOs.  . When a UFO is observed, the tele- scope will focus on the object while an attached camera films it. Simul- taneously, an \"identification\" video- tape will modulate the laser to trans- mit ^identification data to the UFO. That data will include a short video (TV) presentation of a daylight view of the site, pictures of the faces of project leaders, a statement (both by voice and by pictures) indicating that there are no weapons at the site, a statement of the P.S.I, scientific pur- poses, and an invitation to any intel- ligences receiving the transmission to respond by similar transmission (which P.S.I, equipment will record and display on video screen) or else by an actual landing. Digital time data will simultaneously be recorded on the film of the UFO and on the tapes made. Simultaneously, the magnetic pro- file of the UFO will be detected by a highly sensitive magnetometer, and automatically recorded with digital time data. More Equipment Within the year, P.S.I, personnel hope to add gravitometers, ion- sensors, broad band radio monitoring equipment, and other scientifically useful monitoring equipment to the laboratory site. Part of the equipment is capable of loading into a van for trips to areas where UFO \"flaps\" seem to be occurring. P.S.I. Director Stanford says that the layman, even a child, can make a crude magnetic UFO detector which would ring a bell if a UFO possessing certain types of magnetic field comes — 17— within a mile or two. P.S.I, offers free plans for such detectors (which can be built for $5 to $10) to anyone sending a stamped, self-addressed envelope to: P.S.I., P.O. Box 5310, Aus- tin, Texas 78763. P.S.I, is an open, scientific en- deavor, receptive to suggestions from and cooperation with qualified UFO researchers, engineers, ' and scien- tists. \"There is some evidence,\" the P.S.I, director says, \"That a solution to the UFO mystery might also di- rectly solve our energy-fuel problems.

Effective January 1, 1975, a slight modification of the MUFON dues structure and SKYLOOK subscription fee as announced in the November, 1974, issue of SKYLOOK will take place. As previously reported, the com- bined MUFON membership and SKY- LOOK subscription will now be $12 per year. The new dues arrangement is effective on Jan. 1, 1975, for new members or upon the date your pres- ent SKYLOOK subscription expires if you are presently a MUFON member. MUFON members who are under eighteen (18) years of age may take advantage of the special rate of $10 annually. The major revision in the originally proposed plan concerns those.people who desire to subscribe to SKYLOOK only, but prefer not to participate ac- tively as a MUFON member. These subscribers will send their $8 sub- scription fee to SKYLOOK, 26 Edge- wood Drive, Quincy, 111. 62301, when they renew their present subscription or request new subscribers. MUFON members will send their $12 annual dues, which includes .a SKYLOOK subscription, to MUFON, 40 Christopher Court, Quincy, 111. 62301 U.S.A. Since the study of the UFO phenomenon is frequently a family affair, members in the same family, that is, identical address, may elect to receive only one copy of SKYLOOK. When one MUFON mem- ber in the family pays the regular $12 dues/subscription rate, additional people in the same family may be MUFON members for only $4 each if they so designate when sending in their dues. Your Board of Directors feel that these slight modifications will not — 18— only cover the increased costs of pub- lishing SKYLOOK each month, but will help,to defray part of the salary of our new Office Secretary, Mrs. Carol Ruggiero. The NBC TV NEWS Documentary titled \"UFO's: Do You Believe?\" was viewed nationwide on Sunday, Dec. 15, 1974, via 200 NBC affiliated sta- tions. Written and produced by Craig Leake and reported by Jim Hartz, this special one-hour film was scheduled in the most opportune time. Even though the show did not meet all of the expectations of those fa- miliar with the UFO scene, it pro- vided a very favorable exposure to the nation's viewers of the work and activities of MUFON. Regretfully, the Center for UFO Studies was not mentioned; however, Dr. J. Allen Hy- nek was prominently presented. Ted Phillips, MUFON Specialization Co- ordinator, and your Director had key roles in this hour-long video film, which has brought about a deluge of mail from across the nation, seeking information about MUFON and SKY- LOOK. ... . Many of our MUFON members ap- peared on nationwide TV when they were filmed at our 1974 UFO SYM- POSIUM in Akron, Ohio, on June 22 and 23, and also at our UFO Picnic in Carlyle, III, on July 20 and 21. Confidentially, we were a little dis- appointed in the selection of some of the UFO sighting reports depicted and the inability of the witnesses to present strong and convincing evi- dence. However, contrasting this per- sonal critique, we have received \"glowing\" accounts about the show as evaluated by interested viewers.

Location: east of Kernersville, N.C. Witness: Joseph Kent Needham. Investigated by Tarheel UFO Study Group. Submitted by Richard C. Austin, N. L. Bell, and M. B. Quate. Joseph Kent Needham, 16, a high school student, was reportedly return- ing from work at 11:15 p.m. on Aug. 27, 1974, when he observed an object glowing brightly ahead of him when he rounded a bend in the road on US 421. The object he described re- sembled a standard type saucer with a small dome. He said it was as wide as the road (22 feet, 9 inches), and that two legs were visible, attached well in from the edge of the object and extending outward, resting on the pavement. He had the \"impression\" there was a third leg, but he di'd not see it The entire outline, inluding legs, was fuzzy, but glowing brightly with a white light resembling in hue and brilliance a full moon high in the sky. Moderate fog was present at the time of the reported observation. The witness says he slowed from 50 miles per hour to 30 miles per hour upon seeing the object, and that the object \"blinked out\" when he got about 100 yards from it. Needharn says he did not stop, but drove through the area where he had seen UFO films slated for TV showings Howard Lipstone, a partner in Alan Landsburg Productions, stated in a recent telephone conversation that their full-length motion picture film previously titled \"The Primal Fac- tor\" has been changed to \"The Outer Space Connection\" and will be re- leased early in February, 1975. Watch for advanced billing in your local theaters. The Sandier Institutional Films mo- tion picture titled \"UFO's Past, Pres- ent, and Future\" written by Robert Emenegger and produced by Alan F. Sandier will be released for television instead of the motion picture theaters as originally announced, but the show- ing date is unknown at this time. the object. The witness says he felt no unu- sual effects before, during, or after the sighting. The next day he filled out a sighting form he had received earlier from MUFON North Carolina Director George Fawcett at a lec- ture given by Fawcett. Investigation by the Tarheel UFO Study Group revealed no ground markings which could earily be con- nected with a UFO; it had rained hard three times between the time of the alleged sighting and the investiga- tion, however. The Tarheel group concluded that \"this does appear to be one of the more credible sightings in the area, even though no ground markings were in evidence.\" Astronomy magazine features Hill map The December issue of Astronomy Magazine contains a lengthy and im- pressive article concerning the re- search conducted by SKYLOOK staff- er Marjorie Fish on the Betty and Barney Hill Star Map. The 14-page lead article briefly re- views the Hill case (see The Inter- rupted Journey by John G. Fuller, Dial Press, 1966) and the development of a scale model of the universe by Miss Fish (see SKYLOOK, July, 1974). The author of the article, Astronomy Editor Terence Dickin- son, visited with Miss Fish in Ohio while researching the article. Perhaps the most helpful portion of the article is that which describes, step by step, the scientific search for stars most likely to be suitable for life as we know it. Through extensive descriptions and excellent illustra- tions in color, the somewhat compli- cated subject is clarified. Dickinson draws no conclusions in the article regarding estraterrestrial life, but does leave the question open. It is a very informative article, and one which is highly-recommended for SKYLOOK readers.

Since this issue was rich in sighting data, some comparison with past sightings seems appropriate. The \"sparkling wedge\" of Austria bears some resemblance to several 19th Century reports of glowing and spark- ling masses described in Chapters 3-5 of Mysteries of the Skies, by Lore & Deneault, including an interesting incidence of blue and red colors. Merging Spheres The reports from Romania included two spheres merging into one object, a milky fog, green liquid on the ground, and a UFO with greenish halo. When .we were preparing The UFO Evidence for publication, we al- most included categories- »that we called \"merging\" and \"separation\" cases, but decided against it because of,.having too few examples (maybe 'a -.d'pzen or so of each). These have .since become fairly well established as recurring fea-. tures. The witness sketch of the merg- ing spheres brings to mind-a range of reports with some family resem- blance, -including the relatively rare \"dumbbell- shape (See The UFO Evi- dence, p. 64). Somewhat similar con- figurations were reported at Damon, Texas, 9-3-65 (UiEtfs: A New Look, p. 7) and by then Florida Governor Burns 4-25-66* (U.F.O. Investigator, Vol. III No. 8, p. 3).

The 3-8-67 Leominster, Mass., case (See UFOs: Interplanetary Visitors, Fow- ler p. 143-148) contains a parallel ex- ample of localized \"fog,\" and many reports describe wisps of \"cloud\" or \"vapor\" around UFOs (See Strange Effects From UFOs, 11-10-57, Madi- son, Ohio, p. 11; 8-19-65, Cherry Creek, N.Y., p. 43). The Cherry Creek case further included a purplish liquid .on the ground, and both vapor and an oily substance appear .in the 6-29/64 La- vonia, Ga., case (Strange Effects, p. 5). The elliptical UFO chased by a policeman near Richmond',: Va;, 624-66 was surrounded -by \"a 'mist or vapor\" (Strange Effects, p. 9). The liquid substances at- UFO sites suggest that part- of an investigator's kit should be some sterile cotton and sealed jars to absorb some of the liquid and preserve it for analysis. Green Halo The green halo effect has been pres- ent in the 3:19-65 Japanese airliner case (also involving E-M effects), the 7-13-59 Blenheim, N.Z., near-landing with visible Occupants (UFOs: A New Look, p. 29), and many others, often brightly illuminating the surrounding area. Such patterns deserve far more attention than, to my knowledge, they have received. The following refers to a letter by Ron Westrum in the Nov. issue.
