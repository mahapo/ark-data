FROM THE EDITOR The issue you hold in your hands is the MUFON Journal's 250th. No other continuously published UFO journal can make that claim, not even the venerable Flying Saucer Review, which first began appearing in 1955. How we achieved such a landmark is no dark mystery. For starters, for most of its nearly 25 years, FSR has been a quarterly publication. The Journal, on the other hand, for its 20 years, has appeared monthly. And while other UFO organizations have come and gone, MUFON, the Mutual UFO Network, the Journal's publisher, remains a vigorous, via- ble entity. Needless to say, no one person is responsible for the Jour- nal's success. An editor, and there has been an illustrious string of same, can only publish what comes in over the transom. For the overwhelming most part that means articles freely contrib- uted by our writers, the great majority of whom have the ordi- nary first obligations of family and occupation. The ranks of pro- fessional ufologists, unfortunately, can be counted on the fingers of one hand It is to those for whom ufology is a labor of love, then, that we at the Journal owe so much thanks and apprecia- tion. Without you, there would most likely be no Journal. The Mutual UFO Network, Inc. is exempt from Federal Income Tax under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.

Status Report V By Leonard H. Stringfield Part II From my perspective the official coverup and the way it was con- trolled seemed as effective as ever up to the Fall of 1987. Both the Ken- tucky and Ohio incidents described in Part I which involved civilians, show that anything goes, from trickery to threats, to keep the facts hidden. Then, throughout 1988, like the burst of dawn, something changed. Whether or not the iron lid has loo- sened or not, more people, con- cerned people, suddenly became more vocal. Of interest were the implica- tions of MJ-12, the meaning of abduc- tions, the flap of low-level UFOs in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, the Gulf Breeze affair, and what was said and left unsaid about alien- human relations by two disguised informers, \"Condor and Falcon\" on TV's The UFO Coverup* Yes, things have changed. It's reflected in my volume of mail and the phone calls I get at all hours. Is the coverup in a \"calculated\" countdown from ten to a three, two, one and lifting? Frankly, I don't think the time is right for a sudden formal announce- ment of alien \"visitors\" by the world powers which would have unpredic- table societal effects. If the press were to suddenly wake up and demanded the bottom line of all the UFO happenings in the MJ-12 files or * The identities of both \"birds\" are known to me. Condor was an Air Force officer stationed at Wright-Patterson AFB in September 1985 during which time he called me on several occasions. Expressing interest in my research and my sources, he claimed to know a colonel with sensitive information relative to my work but his proposal for me to meet with this source fell through. I heard no more. Later I learned that he confided with a member of the Fund for UFO Research and after that with Bill Moore, etc. MUFON UFO Journal, No. 250, February 1989 were to confirm the horrors des- cribed in an expose of the alleged secret Project Grudge Report #13 released by a former Air Force officer, Bill English, then we would have more to worry about than just the stock market. But maybe the coverup is loosen- ing a little because of new pressures, or guilt, or leaks, or the fear of more Falcons and Condors. Maybe we are being spoonfed in various ways and the masqueraded Falcon and Condor are only doing their job. But while the media still sleeps, amid all the UFO \"noise,\" I have seen a change on my thermostat. For whatever reason, I'm suddenly getting more C/R input which I share, in brief, as follows: CASE 9) Thanks to the in-depth research of Stan Gordon, Director of the Pennsylvania Association for the Study of the Unexplained, headquar- tered in Greensburg, the Kecksburg crash/retrieval case of December 9, 1965, may now find recognition as a classic in the annals of ufology. Con- sidering the number of witnesses tracked down by the PASU group, it may be upfront with Roswell. As Case B-l, the incident originally was reviewed in Status Report II by Clark McClelland but, at that time, save for knowing that something had crashed and was retrieved, there was some uncertainty about the nature of the object. The Air Force, of course, explained it away as a meteorite; oth- ers suggested space debris. Gordon, however, accepted neither explana- tion as more information and FOIA data surfaced. In the spirit of cooper- ation, he kept me informed. Then, in 1987, by good fortune, Stan met \"Pete\" who showed up at a PASU UFO exhibit at a local mall. Having feared ridicule for 12 years, he finally decided to tell his story. It be- gan at age 19, as a fireman, when his unit in a nearby village was sum- moned by the Kecksburg authorities to help in the search for something that crashed in a wooded area, pos- sibly an aircraft. But the shocker, he said, was when the crash site was located, they found instead of an air- craft, something else — a large acorn-shaped object embedded deep into the ground. Armed with Pete's new informa- tion, Gordon published the full Kecks- burg story, in great detail, in Pursuit, the final quarter 1987 issue. In this lengthy paper he reports the UFO's flight pattern across several states, tells of the firsthand experiences of local residents who saw the fireball crash and of others who witnessed the sudden, incursive \"takeover\" by the military to perform the retrieval operation. According to Gordon, many of the local citizens viewed the action as constituting a state of martial law, and comments, \"Many were influ- enced enough by their contacts with military or local authorities to the effect that they refused to discuss what they saw or were told even to this day.\" Before being chased from the crash site by the retrieval team, Pete and companions had a closehand look at the semi-submerged mystery object. To them, it appeared that the object had descended in about a 30 degree angle and had broken tree limbs and knocked down a 15 to 20-foot high tree before impacting. The trench was about 25 feet long and at the greatest depth about 7 feet. Puzzling was that there were no signs of fire. The size of the acorn-shaped UFO — without windows or seams — could not be determined because of its submergence, but it was estimated to have been about 7 feet high and 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Author Leonard H. Stringficld wide. Pete, in trying to give a better des- cription of the craft, said that it gave him the impression of a deflated beach ball pushed in and, toward the bottom, there was a ring or bumper- like structure about 8 to 10 inches wide that seemed to cover the cir- cumference of the object. On this bumper, he said, which was raised up off the surface, was a writing that looked like Egyptian hieroglyphics. He remembered the characters of broken and straight lines, dots, rec- tangles and circles. As a machinist for 25 years and familiar with metals, solid and liquid, he said, \"Never in my life have I seen the color of that metal in any shape or form.\" Pete said he never will forget the excitement on his return to the Kecksburg firehall, which had been set up as a command post. It was swarming with military personnel, mostly Air Force, and a lot of equip- ment was being carried in. Soon guards were at the front entrance and the firemen, before being dis- 4 missed from the building, were told to use outside toilets. There is much, much more to Gordon's article, like his learning later that Air Force records showed that NORAD's Space Detection and Tracking System did not have any space junk reentering Earth's atmos- phere that day. Thanks to Gordon, I was privileged to interview Pete on the basis I would not use his name. Pete gave me his complete story, confirming Gordon's version. I asked him about the hieroglyphics wondering if they could be Russian. \"No way!\", he said, \"I'm of Russian-Polish des- cent and can read Russian. It was not Russian, nor American.\" He added, \"I'll stake my life on it, the object was not man-made.\" Roswell CASE 10) The crash and recovery of an \"alien\" object near Roswell, New Mexico in July 1947, so well documented by researchers Bill Moore and Stan Friedman, and others, is a case that should cause skeptics to think twice before they impugn the existence of UFOs or the plausibility of the extraterrestrial hypothesis. Though most of Roswell's firsthand sources were civilian, the overall evi- dence supporting this \"nut-and-bolt\" incident is massive. Of significance, ironically, is the report that news of the UFO's discovery at the base slipped out in an \"uncleared\" press release by the PIO, 1st Lt. Walter Haut. Had it not been for a fast and effective coverup, the full story once in public domain could have rewritten what we know as history. Having been informed, perhaps mankind in his philosophical and geopolitical pur- suits would have chosen a wiser course. Except for rumors, the truth about Roswell did not surface until 1978 when the late Jesse Marcel told an NBC radio newsman, Steve Tom in Chicago, about his official role as the intelligence officer assigned to the crash site to retrieve the scattered debris. On April 7, 1978, Tom called me and linked me up with Marcel in Houma, Louisiana, to get his story firsthand. This led to other calls to Marcel, and upon learning that we had served in the 5th Air Force, dur- ing WWII, in the same combat areas in Leyte, of the Phillipines, we deve- loped a feeling of camaraderie and talked about meeting together for a UFO discussion in the near future. For the moment he confirmed that the debris he combed from the crash site on the Brazel ranch was not the remains of a balloon and that he had observed on a fragment of metal beam, a row of symbols looking like hieroglyphics. (See Status Report II, Case A-10, and the foregoing Kecks- burg case describing hieroglyphic sym- bols.) Regretfully, I never got to meet Jesse Marcel as we had hoped to do. During 1978 when the floodgates opened for me with enormous C/R input I was working at full capacity and plans to go \"here and there\" were dropped. Bill Moore, however, concentrating on his book, The Ros- well Incident, made the trip and interviewed Marcel. Following is one statement, in part, by Marcel that still had some questions unanswered: \"... that next afternoon, we loaded MUFON UFO Journal, No. 250, February 1989"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"everything into a B-29 on orders from Colonel Blanchard and flew it all to Ft. Worth. I was scheduled to fly it all the way to Wright Field in Ohio, but when we got to Carswell at Ft. Worth, the general nixed it. He took control at this point, told the press it was all a weather balloon, and ordered me not to talk to the press under any circumstances. I was pulled off the flight and someone else was assigned to fly the stuff up to Wright Field...\" (Italics mine). My Status Reports do pay off. Thanks to one reader, John August, in Hawaii, I got the \"missing link\" referred to by Marcel as the officer who flew the B-29 with the Roswell remains to Wright Field. Following up his initial phone call with the news Labor Day 1988, August wrote, in part, the following: \"Confirmation of the Roswell crash reached me through a Maui resident who claimed that her father, Captain O.W. Henderson, flew the retrieved spaceship from Roswell to Wright Field on a B-29. According to Hender- son's wife, who was reached by phone, a news officer reported the incident but it was quickly quieted down. On February 17, 1981 the story appeared in the tabloid Globe and Henderson admitted to his wife and daughter that the story was true. The crew, she said, were little people with exceptionally large heads ... At the time Henderson was stationed with the 509th Bomb Group at Ros- well. It was an elite group for which all involved required high-security clear- ances. Besides being a highly deco- rated pilot during WWII, with over 30 combat missions, Henderson was in charge of the movement of all pas- sengers and freight transported by air for organizations participating in the atomic bomb tests and the Manhat- tan Project... \" Enclosed, as a result of August's attentive spadework, were copies of photos showing'Captain Henderson and flight crew and a letter of com- mendation for an \"excellent job accom- plished\" from Carl Spaatz, Com- manding General, AAF, forwarded to Colonel William Blanchard, Command- er, 509th, etc. For verification, August footnoted MUFON UFO Journal, No 250, February 1989 The crash and recovery of an \"alien\" object near Roswell, New Mexico in July 1947 is a case that should cause skeptics to think twice before they impugn the existence of UFOs or the plausibility of the extraterrestrial hypothesis. his letter with Mrs. Henderson's address and phone number. Calling her October 1, 1988 I explained my work; asked many questions to which she cordially responded and got approv- al to publish her name in this report, minus address. She said that her husband, known as \"Pappy\" among his buddies, passed away in 1986 and stated unequivocally that he flew the B-29 with the Roswell wreckage, to Wright field and kept the secret faith- fully until 1981. She remembers his comment, \"I've been dying to tell you for years, but couldn't. It was top secret.\" When I asked Mrs. Henderson if he had ever described the object he transported, she said he told her \"it was strange,\" avoiding details. CASE 11) Avoiding details, it seems goes with the business of covert work if one must talk at all. And so it was with another source who managed to whisper a few words on his death bed about his stealthy activity at Roswell in 1947. The source, Bev, is British; her father, a former American service- man, a staff sergeant who served and took up residence in England follow- ing duty in the Pacific theatre, WWII, and notably with the 509th Bomb Group, Walker Field, Roswell. Accord- ing to records, he was at Roswell dur- ing the same time as Major Jesse Marcel and Captain O.W. Henderson. Bev, referred to me by Timothy Good, British author of Above Top Secret, is by the tone of her letters and phone calls sincere in trying to verify her dad's alleged participation in the Roswell retrieval case. She sent me copies of all his military records which confirmed his assignment at Walker Field in Roswell. These included orders cut for hospitalization at the base for both he and Major Marcel and his pass to the base's Non-Com Club dated July 1947. As a child, Bev recalls her dad talk- ing about his hush-hush work at Roswell and whenever he described the nondescript bodies her response was to giggle. The subject never came up much she said until she was a teenager. Once, she recalls, he had read a feature story in a newspaper about a UFO crash and looking grim he told about his experience of stand- ing guard where the bodies were stored and cautioned all family mem- bers to keep it quiet lest he get into trouble. According to Bev's long let- ter and attached military records, she recalled the following: ... He stood guard once outside a hangar where a crashed saucer was stored. He couldn't see anything as it was all packed up and ready to be flown out to Texas the next day. We disagree on the number of bodies he saw. I'm sure he said two, but one of my sisters said three... All available men stood guard duty around the site where a crashed disc had come down and they couldn't understand why they had to be kept cold, as there were trucks of ice... Although he and others were told they would get into trouble if they saw too much they did look under the cover and saw two small dead bodies. They said they were like us, but not like us. They were smaller than a normal man with large heads and slanted eyes. He also said they looked yellowish, a bit Asian... I remember when I got older and asked for more information he got angry and said \"that's all I know and I shouldn't have told you that much.\" Whenever he talked about it he always looked worried... His last words, according to Bev, before he died in a hospital in Febru- ary 1986 were about Roswell. CASE 12) When I last made con- tact in January 1987 with Jeff Morse,"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"the former \"Blue Beret\" who lifted the lid on the Ft. Dix-MacGuire affair, I felt that my chase for more suppor- tive information, at least through him, had ended and I was back on the treadle of the proverbial squirrel's cage. As agreed, Morse met with Dick Hall, his brother William (an electron- ics engineer), Dr. Bruce Maccabee, Chairman of the Fund for UFO Research, and myself in a busy mall near Washington, D.C. in January, 1987. Over lunch, he openly ans- wered any questions about the inci- dent, but grimaced over the tangled and costly prospects of his current legal pursuits in Federal Court involv- ing an incident of harassment (See MUFON UFO Journal, June 1987) On departure, he said he planned to return to his work overseas and I wished him well and thought of the seven years I had spent investigating his case. No word from Morse since, but his words that day left the four of us believing that he was telling the truth about the ill-fated alien interloper. Since I presented Morse's story in Status Report IV at the MUFON Symposium in St. Louis, 1985, there was a spark of hope in 1986 of get- ting a new source as backup, a former master sergeant who was sta- tioned at Ft. Dix in January, 1978. According to Pat Marcattilio, a MUFON investigator in New Jersey, the source, \"Mr. S,\" whom he knew at a place of previous employment, told him that he heard the rumors about the inci- dent and on his own time tried to round up the facts. But he got nowhere and learned that all records, tapes, every- thing, had been destroyed. He was also advised to stop snooping. When Marcattilio later tried to get more details from \"Mr. S\" he \"seemed very nervous and refused to talk about it.\" In September 1988 a new source with convincing credentials called me about the incident. As a MUFON State Section Director in New Jersey and presently serving as vice presi- dent of the Air Force Association, he was in January 1978 an intelligence officer with rank of major at McGuire AFB. Although not a witness to the retrieval operations, he was in a key position to put the twos-and-twos together enough to give credence to the story told by Morse. His letter of September 6th to me, in part, follows: \"... I attempted to recall as best I could the report of the alien being shot on the base back in January 1978. My job was Deputy Director of 21st Air Force Intelligence 438th Mil- itary Wing Intelligence. In this dual role, we were responsible for briefing both the 21st Air Force Commander, who controlled all military airlift air- craft in half the world over to India and the Wing Commander at McGuire AFB. \"I remember walking into the 21st Command Post and most people were talking about an incident that had occurred on the base during the night. The report was that an alien, a short little guy, had died from a gun- shot wound. No one seemed to know where he came from or what he was doing on the base. At first it was treated as a joke and that the Secur- ity Police must have meant an alien from another country, like Mexico. \"Usually, I would brief the Com- mander, Major General Tom Sadler, on anything important that occurred during the night. We were concerned about acts of terrorism, hijacking and Soviet movements that could be a threat to our aircraft. Normally, if something was felt to be important, I would either brief the General in a stand-up briefing in the Command Post or if it was classified above 'Secret' in his office. \"... Later in the morning I was told that Intelligence would not brief the General on the alien; that the Secur- ity Police Commander or a Liaison Officer was handling it. Later in the day I saw the officer who was a Lt. Colonel (name unknown), coming out of the general's office. He looked tired and somewhat under pressure. He said 'Hello.' I expected the Lt. Colonel to fill me in on the situation but he avoided saying anything ... Assuming this was an alien, I wonder how he got lost from his craft?\" The answer to my source's ques- tion comes from still another officer allegedly on the scene in early Janu- ary during a phase of significant UFO activity over the two large military compounds. During this phase, I was told one of the craft had malfuncti- oned and crash-landed. One survivor of the crew, lost and starving, man- aged to reach the outer perimeter near a guard post at Ft. Dix and was shot by an MP. Said my source, the interloper, mortally wounded, was later found dead at McGuire. Here, relying on Morse's testimony, the \"alien\" was retrieved from an aban- doned airstrip. The Lt. Colonel who briefed General Sadler, referred to by the intelligence officer in his letter, had been pre- viously identified by Morse as his Commanding Officer, whose name was made known to me. His name, rank and serial number, as well as the officers who interrogated Morse at Wright-Patterson AFB following the incident had all been authenticated by the National Personnel Records Cen- ter, St. Louis in 1985. Also of interest is a letter of Sep- tember 12, 1985 from the New Jersey State Police in response to a letter from Robert Bletchman, attorney in Manchester, Connecticut, asking about accessibility to their records of alleged involvement in the incident. Theirs, quoted in part, reads: \"... Please be advised that it has been and con- tinues to be the policy of the New Jersey State Police that the records, radio logs and other documents main- tained at our stations are privileged and are to be kept confidential. We further advise that we do not con- sider them to be within the public domain in conjunction with general disclosure, etc ...\" This information should answer those in research who queried the State Police about its involvement and were told that they have no such records. For me, the evidence collected over eight years of investigation into this case may not prove that UFOs are real or extraterrestrial, but it does show that such incidents, if true, would be difficult to explain to a benighted public. Thus, the coverup. El Yunquc CASE 13) Had I known when I was touring San Juan in Puerto Rico March 7, 1984 that a UFO had crashed on February 19 into the MUFON UFO Journal, No. 250, February 1989"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"/ if as told one of the craft had malfunctioned and crash-landed. One survivor, lost and starving, managed to reach the outer perimeter near a guard post at Ft. Dix and was shot by an MP. mountainous region of El Yunque and, had I gone there, I would have found units of the military retrieval team still active. Barry Greenwood, editor of Just Cause, first enlightened me about the crash at the MUFON Symposium in Washington, D.C. in 1987. He then had few details and I heard nothing more. Then, in August, 1988, Jorge Martin, editor of Enigma, a UFO pictorial-news magazine, published in Puerto Rico in Spanish, called me to relate that he had two items of signif- icance: one concerned a possible alien underground facility on the island; the other, new information about the 1984 UFO crash. His con- tinuing investigations in the crash, he said, had produced new sources who had witnessed some important phases of the military retrieval operation. Through the gracious assistance of Ms. Anna Gloria Colon, MUFON State Director of Puerto Rico, Mar- tin's records, including tapes, were translated from Spanish to English for use in this report. Martin, like all Puerto Ricans, first learned of the crash in the news. Witnesses were many, most describ- ing the object as round, white, self- luminous with a tinge of orange at its rear outer edge. Flying horizontally to the East, the object suddenly jerked, and in arch fashion, went straight up, leveled, and then continued its sound- less trajectory course eastward to where it was last seen crashing into the El Yunque mountains. Among the witnesses were the passengers and crew of a commercial airline flight from the Virgin Islands and a first- hand report from two men in Fajardo, who watched from their 10th floor apartment the \"spinning\" object as it plummeted to earth. Notable is the experience of Luis Morales, police- man, working out of the Rio Grande police station near El Yunque, who saw the object crashing, and said that MUFON UFO Journal, No. 250, February 1989 when he tried to reach the area his car suddenly went dead. Before too much suspense could be built up in the news the story was snuffed. According to Martin, as a diversionary tactic to keep everybody out of the crash area, the authorities told the police that the object, a meteorite, fell well beyond El Yunque and that investigations had been called off. Not so, said Martin, who talked with Benjamin Gascot, officer for the air rescue division operating out of Isla Grande Airport. According to Gascot, \"Something was wrong about this incident because we as a group of officials always worked together in the past.\" Martin also learned from the officer that on the morning of the investigation a mysterious helicopter, painted black and without identifica- tion, showed up at the site. \"The occupants\" he said, \"were dressed in military fatigues and in plain clothes,\" adding, \"we were advised not to talk to the crew.\" Confirmation came from another firsthand source, Michael Pazo, who operated a refueling station at the Isla Grande airport. He, too, had seen the helicopter, identified as a Chi- nook, that brought in the military personnel and further claimed that El Yunque had been under military sur- veillance for three weeks. Pazo also stated that the object that crashed was \"very radioactive\" and that he, being a witness to the activities, was told by a federal agent, named Swag- gart, to \"keep things quiet or else ...\" Still another source, according to Martin, claimed that a second helic- opter landed two days later with more personnel and that a Learjet, with NASA markings, flew over the El Yunque area for two weeks. Of Martin's many sources, one working in security (unknown to me) provided him with details of the on- site \"packaging\" of the pieces of metal from the wreckage. The infor- mant said the parts were catalogued, labeled and protectively wrapped before being boxed conforming to the exact size of each artifact. Then, the wooden boxes were sprayed with a leaded paint, followed by another coat of a chemical substance the color of fuchsia. Still hoping to get some kind of official response to the crash, Martin said he asked Barry Greenwood to check with the FAA. .Word came back from an official of the Southeast Division: no such incident took place. For Martin, it was a flat denial of everything he had heard from scores of firsthand sources. For me, it was one more case in keeping with the coverup of all UFO crashes and retrievals and to hide the evidence at all costs.

Listening was \"Mike,\" (real name withheld on request) who sur- faced in September 1988 to tell Lear his firsthand story. Admittedly troubled by his experience, Mike explained that in 1973 he had been an Air Force photographer stationed in Hawaii, following duty in Vietnam. His prime duty there was processing gun camera film. One day he said he was notified that his security clear- ance had been upgraded and several weeks later he and another photo- grapher in his unit were flown for a temporary duty assignment to Norton AFB in California. Lear's letter to me, November 21, 1988, recounting briefly his interview with Mike is paraphrased as follows: On landing at Norton, Mike and companion were taken by Air Force vehicle with windows blacked out on a two hour drive. During the drive, Mike was told by the driver, \"So you guys are going to photograph the UFO, eh?\" The vehicle came to a halt on a platform which was then lowered into a large underground installation. Escort- ed to a briefing room they were told that they were to photograph a flying saucer and the autopsy of three dead aliens. Ordered to disrobe, they were issued white smocks and combat boots for security purposes. Mike was then escorted into the installation where he saw a disc-shaped craft about 30 feet in diameter contained in a heavy net suspended from a large crane. Mike was boosted into the opening of the disc (no stairs or ramp) and proceeded to crawl inside. He was shocked, he said, to find that the inside looked to be about 10 times the size of the outside. He com- mented, \"I could have thrown a foot- 8 ball as hard as I could and not hit the other side.\" Disoriented, Mike poked his head back outside to check the size which appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter as before. Once inside he met two persons similarly clothed in white smocks who showed him what they wanted photographed. He shot many photos of control pan- els and various other fixtures and later was asked to photograph the exterior from different angles and distances. He was later taken to a room in which there were three dead aliens. He described them as approximately 5 feet tall, with almost normal human heads except .the eyes were more rounded. The skin texture was of baking dough, very white. Before the autopsy the aliens had been dressed in blue uniforms, like flight suits. As the initial incisions were made for the autopsy, Mike saw green fluid and black innards. At this time he became ill and called for the other photographer to continue the assign- ment. Later that day they were driven back to Norton where they spent the night and were flown out the next day to Hawaii. About two months later Mike's companion dis- appeared and neither Mike or his family have heard from him since. The year 1973 brings to mind Case A-2, Status Report II, where three humanoids were examined at Wright- Patterson AFB. While the head sizes described in each case differ and the body heights also differ by a foot or so, the description of the skin is strik- ingly similar. According to the ser- geant in Case A-2, who stood guard in the underground facility, the color was \"off white or cream.\" Both observers, it should be noted, were admittedly traumatized by the sight of alien bodies which could account for visual differences of anatomical sizes and heights. FBI? CASE 15) For those of us in research who wonder or worry about the rigors of coverup, effective for so long, the suspicion remains that the reason for it must be compelling; in fact, so compelling that it may explain why it is maintained at any price — even at the price of sudden death to those having sensitive information who may talk too much. Evidence of such thinking finds sup- port in the recent disclosure of a retired police officer with 22 years of service in an Eastern state. Through the coopera- tion of John Ford, head of the Long Island UFO Network, I first received word August 5, 1988, that his source had information concerning a crashed disc and the recovery of seven bodies in a western state, which in some way also involved the FBI. Filling Ford's request for a notar- ized statement, insuring his source's anonymity, I then received his video- taped interview with him. After view- ing this, which firmly established the former officer's credentials, I reached him by phone for his firsthand story. It was in 1973, he said, that he was joined by two FBI agents in a special 3- day training program for cadets on \"behavioral science\" at the police academy. One evening after a long day's work, he and the two agents went out to dine and relax when the subject of UFOs came up. To his surprise, he said, one talked about a crashed disc in Colo- rado and the recovery of bodies. \"I could tell by his body English that he was disturbed.\" He said that a doctor who had been called on in the night for urgent medical needs died suddenly of \"cancer\" three weeks later. At that point, according to my informant, he observed that the talkative agent was booted under the table by his compan- ion. The subject was dropped and nothing was said about the FBI's role in the affair. Sudden and accidental death stories I've heard before. Never finding any substantiation, I relegated them to a quirk of orchestrated propaganda, proba- bly a scare tactic to intimidate potential whistle-blowers.

Word comes from Gor- don Creighton, editor of the informa- tive Flying Saucer Review, who notes a possible deathly tie-in with the U.S. \"Star Wars\" program. Quoting his letter of November 15, 1988, in part, as follows: \"... Here in Britain 22 scientists have recently either taken their own lives or died in very strange or mysterious circumstances. And it seems that most, or all, of them were engaged in British work on behalf of, or related to, the U.S. \"Star Wars\" program. The British government, it seems, was trying to hush it up. But, press statements here say that the U.S. government had put our govern- ment on the spot and demanded full enquiry. So quite clearly, it is either the Russians or THEM.\" As many researchers have sur- mised, \"Star Wars,\" obstensibly con- ceived as a defensive system against Russian missile attack, may have had from its beginning a \"defensive\" UFO connection. Whatever the case, a \"mock test\" in September 1988, of an earth-penetrating warhead — much like \"Star Wars\" in reverse — was conducted at the Tonapah Test Range in Nevada. While announced as a proposed super-weapon designed to destroy Russian underground com- mand centers dug in solid rock down to 1000 meters, some UFO analysts believe that the real target is not Russian but another adversary down deep in cavernous installations in Nevada and New Mexico. According to the Pentagon the proposed earth-penetrating warhead is \"urgently needed.\" According to the rumormills, an alien race, the \"grays,\" in their fortressed under- ground laboratories, are genetically experimenting with the human race. Even more ominous, rumors say that their intransigence today may lead to new perils tomorrow. It is beyond the scope of this paper to speculate on all the sinister machi- nations attributed to the alien super- race, but news of the British death syndrome and my awareness of other suspicious deaths and disappearances allegedly connected to UFO crash and MUFON UFO Journal, No. 250, February 1989 retrieval events must be reckoned with. They may have at least a peri- pheral pertinence to fears, causing suicide or extreme security measures to maintain a monstrous coverup. At this writing (early December, 1988) I have four other sources with UFO crash/retrieval information not included in this report. Most, as far as I know, are in positions to throw strong light on the humanoid factor and other phases of retrieval opera- tions, which could confirm informa- tion already cited in my previous papers. But, at this stage, in some instances dependent on intermediar- ies, I find the material to be either too fragmentary or too sensitive to even hint at as to its nature. The material herein was originally intended as an article updating my work for publication in the MUFON UFO Journal early in 1989.

He is presently at work on a book about abduction cases. We are indeed fortunate to have someone of Michael Sword's caliber involved with UFO thought. His clar- ity of mind, breadth of information and ability to explain the most tech- nical and difficult concepts in an understandable manner is a special talent. Few are able to do it at all and fewer still are able to do it with Dr. Swords' extradorinary skill. He is also to be commended for opening this dialogue about abduction procedures. In this light I was happy to read his thoughtful article about the unlikeli- hood of hybridization of extraterres- trial beings (MUFON Journal, Novem- ber, 1988). In it Dr. Swords advances strong arguments about the difficulty of cross-breeding between species. While I would not presume to debate the biological information included in the article, I feel that there are a few points that need to be addressed. Abnormal Babies One of the constant features of the abduction phenomenon is that time and again male and female abductees say that during the event they are shown babies and that the babies appear to be different than \"normal\" babies. These differences are charac- teristically the same for virtually all abductees whether recalled under hypnosis or not. Abductees describe the babies as being phlegmatic, unre- sponsive, and \"sickly.\" The babies have a large cranium, very large (for a human baby) eyes with small whites, a small (for a human baby) nose, a small (for a human baby) mouth, and small (for a human baby) ears. The skin color is not a normal human skin color, but either light 10 grayish or pale white. The hair is sparse. Their bodies are thin and frail. All the abductees realize that the babies are neither human babies nor alien babies. In fact it is the abducfees who say that the babies look like a cross between the two and they continually refer to the babies as \"hybrids\" or \"cross-breeds.\" Although Aliens do not specifically state that the babies are hybrids, the aliens will frequently tell the abductee that \"this is your baby.\" Many abduc- tees immediately deny the possibility, but some suspect that this is true and the babies may exhibit features con- sistent with this assertion (e.g. the baby may, like the abductee, have red hair). In addition, many female and male abductees feel an instant affinity for the baby and they in some way \"know\" that the baby is indeed theirs or that at the very least they have some sort of \"connection\" with it. Time and again women state that the aliens forced them to \"feed\" the baby and that when they woke up in the morning, they were inexplicably lactating even though they were not pregnant. Finally, these accounts are entirely consistent with the tenacious interests that aliens have displayed in human reproductive processes and this has been a constant feature of virtually all abductee reports. In his article Dr. Swords dismisses as unfeasible biotechnological pro- cesses that promote \"hybrid\" genera- tion. He outlines the problems with cross-breeding between species, and he points out that cross-breeding, although seemingly easy to posit, has so many difficulties that the likelihood of it taking place is practically nil. Yet Dr. Swords ignores the obvious prob- lem with this argument: Although it might be impossible to cross-breed species here on earth, it might be an altogether different situation when you are dealing with a non-earth spe- cies. Not only do we have absolutely no idea what the organic and biologi- cal composition of the aliens is, we also have no sure knowledge that they are biological. Therefore we do not know whether cross-breeding is less or more feasible. It is certainly within the realm of possibility that it is far more feasible than we can imagine. Dr. Swords also fails to include an obvious non-hybridization procedure in his schema: human sperm and egg are united, and then genetic engineering takes place that leads to the babies' unusual physio- logical and mental characteristics. This is not cross-breeding but it would explain the data without having to overthrow it. Dr. Swords says that the aliens appear to be only slightly more advanced than we are and he rejects the argument that they are advanced enough to have solved the seemingly insoluble problems of cross breeding. But since we do not really know exactly what the aliens' purposes are or how they are accomplishing their tasks, it can be just as easily argued (and probably with a greater assu- rance of rectitude) that they are in fact doing exactly what abductees report and therefore they are far more advanced biotechnologically than we can know at this time. The same argument applies to the seeming illog- icalities of utilizing sperm and egg for cross-breeding rather than other more complete cells. The point is we simply do not know what is happening bio- logically and trying to uncover the intricacies of what is not transpiring is a difficult if not impossible task at this time. Moreover, to suggest that aliens can or cannot do something is to pass judgement on their scientific capabilities and to display a rather thorough knowledge about the limits of alien biotechnology and psychology that is not found in the evidence. But Dr. Swords demonstrates familiarity with alien limitations by stating that, \"An artificial birthing tank is surely child's play for such a species,\" and, \"They do not need to harvest sperm or eggs to pursue any genetic exper- iments including hybridization.\" Al- though he may be right, this type of speculation and conclusions is at MUFON UFO Journal, No. 250, February 1989"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Although the hybridization of disparate genes may seem highly unlikely at the moment, given our present state of technology, can we preclude it from being a possibility 100 or even 1000 years from now? present unverifiable; it does not add to our knowledge, and it may throw us off the track. Speculative Scenarios Dr. Swords suggests several scena- rios for suspecting that these events' may not have taken place as des- cribed. One of these scenarios is that aliens might be putting images in people's minds therefore the children may not exist at all. If this is true, he wonders what else might be put in people's minds and therefore even the entire abduction scenario could be a mental construct. In fact images are placed in people's minds for spe- cific procedural reasons and in my forthcoming book I will demonstrate how this works within the abduction scenario. In my research, however, I have found no evidence whatsoever that child presentations are mental constructs. Implanted images are eas- ily discernible and child presentations do not fit this procedure. Child pres- entations have the same quality of recall as all the other nonimagined and seemingly authentic episodes. In order to make the case for image implantation, one must demonstrate that child presentations differ qualita- tively from the reality of all other event-level data within the abduction scenario and then show how that data is generated. Then one must show the connection between an imagined event and its physical sequelae such as lactation. Once again, one can always speculate but there must be some evidence upon which to base the guess. As Dr. Swords alluded to, the key question is not whether aliens can or cannot cross breed between species, but whether the abductees are accu- rately reporting what they are seeing and experiencing. Based on a careful study of over two hundred abduction MUFON UFO Journal, No. 250, February 1989 reports in the past several years, I can state with a reasonably high degree of assurance that they are. If this is true then we are left with a puzzle and no amount of nay-saying is going to make it go away. Denying their validity is certainly one way to confront them. But a more challeng- ing and I think more accurate way of dealing with the material is to do what all good investigators do: go where the evidence leads you and refrain from imposing an anthropo- morphic framework around an event and then denying its reality because the data does not fit that framework. We have a phenomenon and we have the data. We may not have the best data that one can come up with and this has been a problem with the UFO phenomenon in general for the past forty-one years. Abduction data is not any more vulnerable than the standard UFO data that seem to be scientifically impossible like right-angle turns, noiseless hovering, instant accel- eration, and so forth, and like UFOs, we must come to terms with it. The problem of hybridization is just one of an enormous variety of seemingly incomprehensible problems that the abduction phenomenon presents us with. For example, there is no known physiological processes which might lead to an understanding of how tele- pathy, works. Yet virtually all abduc- tees state that the communication they have with the aliens is accomp- lished by this method. Are we to state that this cannot possibly happen and therefore all abductees are mis- taken and that they are actually hear- ing communication through their ears? We can, of course, make this asser- tion but it takes us away from the data and when that happens, any- thing can be explained away and nothing can be learned. Similarly, many abductees claim to have floated through closed windows. At present this is quite impossible and yet to say it cannot happen and therefore it is not happening is to deny one of the central features of the abduction experience and then launch us into a never-never land of groundless speculation. Hynek used to talk about the dominant frame of mind in the Air Force as being, \"It can't be, there- fore it isn't.\" We must be careful not to fall into this trap. By saying that they can not be in some way either combining disparate genes and therefore they are not is to suggest that our present knowledge of genet- ics and biotechnology prevents such an event from happening forever. Although right now it might seem highly unlikely, I certainly would not preclude it from happening 100 or 1000 years from now. Let us not get carried away searching for answers to explain away these accounts. In the end Dr. Swords may be absolutely correct and cross-breeding is not taking place, but we are involved with a highly complex and important area of research and it calls for a steady hand in correctly perceiving and ana- lyzing the information that abduc- tees relate. Even though faulty memories and confabulation can be involved in these accounts we must learn to correctly evaluate the data as best we can. Above all we must not make the central mistake that has fueled emotionally committed debunkers for years: assuming that the data is not correct and then bas- ing explanations upon either changed or ignored data. From what I know about the abduction phenomenon, I would be quite happy to find that all the data that we have amassed has been internally generated by the abduc- tees. But let us not be overzealous trying to make this happen. Saying, \"There ain't no such animal\" can defeat the primary purpose of inves- tigation and analysis: the discovery of the truth. We can only find the truth by confronting the data realis- tically without attaching a current cultural and technological overlay to it. 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Major Donald E. Keyhoe: An Appreciation By Richard Hall Hall, author of Uninvited Guests (1988), is a former MUFON Jour- nal editor. As an Air Force enlisted man in the early 1950's I read Maj. Key hoe's Flying Saucers Are Real, and saw on the service club bulletin board at Keesler AFB, Mississippi, newswire service stories on UFO sightings. Later I read Flying Saucers From Outer Space (which I consider his most important book), and in July of 1952 (vividly remembered) saw the banner headlines about UFOs tracked on radar and pursued by jet intercep- tors over Washington, D.C. By the time I enrolled at Tulane University in 1954, I was convinced that UFOs were no joke and deserved serious scientific attention. Also in 1951 or 1952 — as best I can reconstruct it — while employed in a Connecticut general store I heard a radio newscast reporting that a UFO had crashed somewhere in the West and a surviving occupant was being rushed to a laboratory in California to try to keep him alive. This was totally fascinating, since it was a very straight newscast, and I was (naively) surprised when there was no follow-up report in succeeding, days. At Tulane I originally majored in mathematics (later switching to philo- sophy), and while working in the Math Department on a scholarship one of my duties was to open and distribute the mail. One fateful day in 1957 a letter came addressed to the one-person Astronomy Department, Fraser Thompson (who also taught mathematics), from the National Inves- tigations Committee on Aerial Phen- omena (NICAP) in Washington, D.C. Maj. Keyhoe was announcing the formation of NICAP to encourage serious investigation of UFOs, and seeking support from scientists. I was 12 L,.M. - :.. .-.. J DONALD E. KEYHOE 1897-1988 In memory of Major Donald E Keyhoe, U.S.M.C. Retired, Board of Directors, Mutual UFO Network and former Direc- tor, National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) Died November 29,1988 very excited, wrote to Maj. Keyhoe, and soon became an informal corres- pondent and investigator for NICAP in New Orleans. By the time I graduated with a B.A. in Philosophy in 1958, I had carried on a fairly extensive correspondence with Maj. Keyhoe and was aware that NICAP was operating on a shoestring budget. Nevertheless, I moved to Washington, D.C. to seek Govern- ment work so I could be near NICAP and do what I could to help. While looking for a job I did volunteer work at the Connecticut Avenue office of NICAP. Then came a decision that would change my life. When I was offered a job by Air Force Times at the going salary for new graduates, Maj. Keyhoe offered me a job at part-time salary rates with the hope of becoming full-time as NICAP grew. The first time I met him (he was then a very young 60) he took me to lunch. He was dapper and lively, with a quick intelligence and an equally quick wit. Though he was small in physical stature he stood erect like the Annapolis graduate he was (1919) and was very forthright. His energy and enthusiasm were impressive. I thought over my pros- pects. I was 28, a bachelor who could get by on a small salary, the UFO subject was utterly fascinating — it was no contest. For about the first six years it was tough sledding; UFO sightings faded to an all-time low and NICAP grew only slowly. Then the UFO waves of 1964-1967 turned things around and NICAP reached its peak of activity and influence. Maj. Keyhoe gave me important responsibilities at NICAP, and treated me kindly, with evident care and concern, like a son. He was my mentor, training me in investiga- tive journalism and the craft of writ- ing and editing. When Flying Saucers: Top Secret was published (1960) reporting the early years of NICAP, he gave me a copy inscribed as follows: \"To Dick Hall, my good friend, who as Secretary of NICAP had the hard job of running the organization (doubling in brass raised to the nth degree) while I labored over this book. With the fervent wish that we can soon end the tough battle. With heartfelt thanks and best wishes. Don Keyhoe, May 24, 1960.\" It is one of my prized possessions. In my opinion, Major Keyhoe was the single most important person over the decades of the 1950s to 1970s in publicizing UFOs and keep- ing the issue alive. He was tireless in making public appearances (radio, TV, and lectures) to argue for serious attention to UFOs, and became a MUFON UFO Journal, No. 250, February 1989"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"public figure as the leading spokes- person on the subject. Without his leadership and energetic personality, it is doubtful that the accomplish- ments of today would have been pos- sible. The groundwork he laid both personally and through NICAP paved the way. He was a pioneer and path- finder on UFOs. Contrary to the quite unjust image of him purveyed by detractors, he was far from a one-dimensional per- son with an axe to grind against the Air Force, writing books solely for profit. He was also an aviation pio- neer, as an aircraft and balloon pilot, a Government editor and aviation information official, and an early investigative journalist (probably before the term was coined) who contrib- uted articles to National Geographic Society, Saturday Evening Post, and other major magazines of the time. I knew him as a warm human being with a puckish sense of humor (as is evident from his 1928 book Flying With Lindbergh), and as a dedicated and unselfish man who fought as hard as he could to bring out the truth about UFOs, at considerable personal sacrifice. I am proud to say that \"I Flew With Keyhoe\" - literally en route to brief the University of Colorado UFO Project scientists and staff in 1967, and figuratively during the NICAP years. His role in UFO history has been hugely important. Bryant/Stone v U.S. Government A MUFON Press Release By Robert H. Bletchman Suddenly, and totally unrelated to his job performance, a U.S. Army employee of some 29 years' service receives the ultimate designation of persona non grata from his superiors: an \"unsatisfactory\" performance rating. Earlier, in September 1984, \"UFO- coverup whistleblower\" advertisements had begun appearing nationwide in military post and base newspapers seeking details on such issues as the U.S. government's analysis of arti- facts from crash-landed \"flying saucers.\" What could these two circumstan- ces possibly have in common? The recent decision of ,the U.S. Supreme Court in the First Amend- ment case of Larry W. Bryant v. Caspar W. Weinberger, et al. Filed as Civil Action No. 86-1323A in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia (Alexandria Div- ision), the case emerged as a two- count suit by Bryant to (1) protect his right to submit his ads to printers of various military \"commercial enter- prise\" newspapers without his having to endure arbitrary rejection or other interference from the newspapers' overseers, the post/base public affairs officers; and to (2) reverse the on-the- job reprisal (in the form of the unjus- tified \"unsatisfactory\" rating) taken against him by his superiors at the Pentagon. . MUFON UFO Journal, No. 250, February 1989 Partial Victory Bryant, a writer with the Army's Office of the Chief of Public Affairs, succeeded in settling Count No. 1 with a \"consent order\" issued by the district court judge in April 1987. The order upholds his right to continue submitting his ads seeking first-hand testimony and other evidence about what he calls the \"Cosmic Water- gate.\" \"This represents,\" he said from his home in Alexandria, \"a turning point — both for preserving free speech on public issues and for furthering government accountability for official UFO-related actions and documentation. As director of the Washing- ton office for the public-interest group Citizens Against UFO Secrecy, I've been pursuing the ad campaign to encourage current and former govern- ment officials to blow the whistle on the government's 40-year, history of deceiving the public as to the reality of crash-landed UFOs and their retriev- ed occupants.\" But arriving at the turning point cost Bryant dearly. For his having dared point a finger at the naked emperor's UFO clothes, he found himself the target of trumped-up counseling memos and other harass- ment aimed at punishing him for his heresy and at dissuading him from continuing the ad campaign. Legal Marathon Undaunted in his commitment both to greater freedom of UFO informa- tion and to protection of civil liberty, Bryant chose to take on his detrac- tors in Count No. 2 of his lawsuit. Unfortunately, the government was able to convince the district court judge that the U.S. Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 precludes a civil servant like Bryant from gaining access to the federal court system to contest such cases of on-the-job harassment — even when the free-speech exer- cise takes place off the job in his capacity as a private citizen. Bryant appealed to the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Richmond, VA. A three-judge panel meeting in Baltimore cited its ruling in the 1985 free-speech case of Pinar v. Dole as governing the dismissal of Bryant's claim. \"Had I chosen to stop there, their decision would have meant that the several hundred thousand federal em- ployees no longer would have the same degree of First Amendment protection enjoyed by non-federal people,\" Bryant explained. \"So there was much more at stake here than just the stifling of a UFO researcher.\" 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Indeed, Bryant felt he had no cho- ice but to file a \"Petition for a Writ of Certiorari\" with the U.S. Supreme Court. On the opening day of its cur- rent term, Oct. 3, 1988, the court issued the following order to the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals: \"The petition ... is granted. The judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit for further consideration in light of Web- ster v. Doe, 486 U.S. — (1988).\" In turn, that order was relayed to the District Court in Alexandria. As he awaits further developments in his case, Bryant acknowledges the show of support from fellow UFO researchers, colleagues, and friends. \"They knew, perhaps more than I, that every step of the way I was mak- ing UFOIogical and legal history,\" Bryant said. \"In particular, I owe the most gratitude to a former co-worker, Lisa G. Fetterolf, who bravely had come forward with evidence crucial to the government's admission that Army officials had violated my First Amendment right of free speech. Her sworn declaration, reveals that the former chief of Army public affairs was under orders 'from on high' to 'get rid of me because of my being 'an embarrassment to the govern- ment.\"' Now that his case has added to legal precedent, Bryant intends not to let up. \"I may write a book about all this, some day. Meantime, I've resumed the ad campaign, and I hope to have more time to share results with read- ers of the MUFON UFO Journal and other publications,\" he added. Stone Affair One of Bryant's latest series of ads dealt with the plight of Army Sgt. 1st Class Clifford E. Stone in Roswell, N.M. The ad's title — \"Exposed: Army Invokes 'Stone'-Age Tactics to Silence UFO Activist\" — introduced military personnel to the circumstances sur- rounding Stone's fall from grace at the hands of his superiors at the New Mexico Military Institute. Stone, a veteran of the Vietnam 14 conflict and a MUFON researcher specializing in analysis of the govern- ment's UFO-related documentation, has been leading efforts at getting the full story on the \"Snowbird\" docu- ment. This one-page, \"leaked\" docu- ment had surfaced a few years ago, purporting to reveal the existence of \"Project Snowbird,\" \"Project Sigma,\" and other official projects dealing with U.S. retrieval of \"crashed saucers\" and U.S. exploitation of pertinent alien technology. When some of Stone's superiors learned of his off-the-job pursuit of UFOIogical truth, they chose to make an issue of it at his office. Among other harassment tactics, they relieved Stone of his duty position and branded him an incompetent — this coming from the same officers who earlier had rated him an outstanding non- commissioned officer. After going public with his story, seeking the aid of the Army's inspec- tor general, and, basically, sticking to his constitutional guns, Stone has won some vindication. A \"command- er's inquiry\" recently completed by Stone's new chain-of-command con- cluded that \"The XO (executive officer) (indorser) overreacted to Stone's UFO interest and congressional con- tact, and in so doing, exhibited intol- erance and bias against him. Recon- struction of events ... strongly suggests that action against Stone was not originally intended as a 'relief but merely as a means to conveniently and quickly eliminate him as an 'embarrassment.'\" Toward Future Now spurred on by such high- handed efforts to curb their UFO activism, both Stone and Bryant are continuing to seek greater freedom of UFO information. For his part, Stone is pressing for congressional review of, and interven- tion in, the U.S. National Security Agency's stonewalling on responding further to Stone's pointed inquiries about the \"Snowbird\" document. That agency has invoked the defense that to respond further on such an issue dealing with \"national security policy\" would be improper. Moving ahead on another front, Bryant has been pursuing a freedom- of-information lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice to free up the identity of the principals cited in the now-famous F.B.I, memorandum of March 22, 1950, recounting how three \"flying saucers\" had crashed in New Mexico. \"Because of this suit (which now awaits the judge's decision on the government's motion for summary judgment), the government has admit- ted that it was a 'local law-enforce- ment officer' who had relayed the story to a special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,\" Bryant said. \"This revelation adds to the credibil- ity of the memo's content.\" Ozark UFO Conference The MUFON UFO Journal is privi- leged to announce the forthcoming Ozark UFO Conference to be held on the weekend of April 14, 15, and 16, 1989 at the beautiful Inn of the Ozarks in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, sponsored by Arkansas MUFON.

Looking Back By Bob Gribble FORTY YEARS AGO - Febru- ary 1949: Many witnesses observed a large UFO over Little Rock, Arkan- sas about 3 a.m. on the 25th. The shape appeared as flat and perfectly circular with a diameter of 30 to 60 feet. The entire disc was plainly out- lined by luminescence at an altitude estimated at 10,000 to 12,000 feet. The disc was highly maneuverable. During 30 minutes of observation the UFO appeared to stop and reverse its direction several times. At one time it came to a sudden stop, ascended several thousand feet, stop- ped, then returned to its previous level. The speed was estimated to be several times faster than conventional aircraft, without sound. At one time a beam of light from the disc was directed at the ground. *** THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO — February 1954: At 11 p.m. on the MUFON UFO Journal, No. 250, February 1989 fourth, two radar operators at the Ground Control Approach (GCA) station at Carswell Air Force Base (near Fort Worth, Texas), were start- led by the sudden appearance of a large blip on their radar scope. Because of the unusual size of the blip — which measured one inch in diameter — and because the object was approaching directly over the runway, the GCA controller notified the officer of the day and the base control tower. The UFO passed directly over the tower and was observed by four controllers, one using a pair of binoculars. The tower personnel said they watched the object for an estimated five minutes after it passed over the tower and at no time did it change course. As the UFO passed over the tower the controllers observed a long fuse- lage-like craft with what appeared to be protrusions like wings and stabil- izer, and appeared to be just as large or larger than a B-36 bomber. The craft emitted no sound and it had a very bright white light in the nose and tail and two yellowish lights on the underside. No cabin or other lights were observed. At 11:20 p.m. the GCA radar picked up two more unknowns 27 miles southwest of Carswell, flying in formation. Sud- denly the two targets merged into one and registered as a one-and-a- half-inch blip on the radar screen. Then the one blip seperated into two targets and changed course. Sud- denly, one of the UFOs instantane- ously reversed course, traveled for about two miles, then instantaneously reversed course again and overtook the second object within a few seconds. The following article, written by Jim G. Lucas, Staff Writer for Scripps- Howard newspapers, was published from coast-to-coast on the 13th: \"Commercial airline pilots report be- tween five and 10 UFO sightings each night, it was learned today. Represen- tatives of major airlines will meet Wednesday (the 17th) in Los Angeles, California, with Military Air Transport Service Intelligence officers to discuss speeding up UFO reporting proce- dures. The idea will be to 'get the reports in the quickest possible way' so that the Air Force can send fast jet fighters to investigate. Heretofore, commercial pilots have landed and then reported to MATS through their companies. By that time, the trail usually is cold. \"Now, pilots are instructed to flash reports direct from the air to MATS in- telligence in Washington, D.C., or to the nearest Air Force Base. Airline pilots are asked not to discuss their sightings publicly or give them to newspapers... Two typical UFO reports this week: 1. — A Colonial Airlines pilot, en route to Washington, D.C. from Richmond, Virginia, said he saw a UFO descend from the stratos- phere, approach his aircraft, hesitate for a moment and then reverse its course. He said it appeared to re- enter the stratosphere. 2. — Two Northwest Airlines pilots en route from Seattle, Washington to Anchor- age, Alaska reported a strange object with several portholes which exuded a 'bluish light' flew alongside their air- 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"craft most of the journey, disappear- ing as they were about to land in Anchorage. The pilots tried several times to close the gap between their aircraft and the strange object, but could not. They said the object was 'definitely under someone's control.' They were questioned for two days in Alaska before going on to Tokyo.\" *** THIRTY YEARS AGO - Feb- ruary 1959: Thirty-five passengers aboard a Detroit, Michigan-bound American Airlines DC-6 watched with awe as three illuminated flying discs escorted the airliner through the dark sky for 45 minutes on the llth. Both passengers and crew members on the plane which left Newark, New Jersey nonstop for Detroit at 7:10 p.m. viewed the phenomena while ques- tioning each other, their own powers of observation and their sanity. Prob- ably the most startled was Capt. Peter Killian who had flown pas- senger planes for 15 years and had \"never saw anything like it before.\" Killian even radioed two other Ameri- can Airlines planes flying in the vicin- ity to make sure \"I wasn't seeing lightning bugs in the cockpit.\" Both other captains called Killian back to assure him he wasn't — they saw the UFOs, too. Killian said: \"We were flying around 8500 feet between Philipsburg and Bradford, Pennsylvania at 8:45 p.m. when I looked off to the south and saw three yellowish lights in a single horizontal line overhead. At first I thought it was the Belt of Orion (a group of stars in a constellation) but then I took a second look and saw both the Belt and the foreign objects. The objects were by no means close to the plane, but one would move in at intervals, fall back again, and change its place in the formation while keeping abreast of the ship, which was traveling at 350 miles per hour. All in all, the objects traveled in our direction for about 45 minutes. During that time I kept watch on the radar screen but saw nothing on it.\" Deciding it might be an after-dinner treat for his passengers, Killian talked to them over the intercom. The pas- 16 sengers peered out, saw the objects and began guessing what they might be. One passenger, N.D. Puscas, 41, said: \"The way he broke the news to us was very clever. No one panicked or showed any signs of worry. Eve- ryone immediately began to show a keen interest in what was going on. He did a fine job. There wasn't a cloud in the sky when I looked out and saw the objects in precision for- mation. They were round-like and every now and then one would glow brighter than the other as if it had moved nearer to the plane.\" Based on information Killian had received from other pilots in the area, a triangula- tion was done, and an estimate of 15 miles distance between his aircraft and the nearest UFO was made. The estimated size of the objects was about 300 feet in diameter. *** FIFTEEN YEARS AGO - Feb- ruary 1974: Two brothers, both bus- inessmen in Orange County, Califor- nia, had a terrifying encounter in the Nevada desert on the 14th, with six UFOs which apparently took control of their truck and, flanking it on three sides, floated it slightly off the ground, disrupted its electrical and mechani- cal systems, and guided it to a halt. One of the craft was seen landed on the road ahead on Highway 93, the others in the air. The two were driv- ing a 12-foot U-Haul truck loaded with furniture and were located north of McGill, Nevada when the driver looked out of the left window and observed a round, orange object that appeared to be 10 feet off the desert floor. He then looked out the right window and saw three more smaller objects. The truck was moving at about 55 miles per hour, and suddenly it felt like they had been hit by a blast of wind. The lights flickered on and off and the engine started to miss. Then the driver lost control of the truck and couldn't steer it. Before they could stop, the transmission selector jumped out of drive into neutral, and the truck coasted to a stop in the middle of the road. As they sat in the road with the motor running, they observed a huge silver metal ball with a dome on top and sharp wings, standing still over a hill to the left. It was pulsating. Then they spotted a huge light on the road in front of them about a mile away. The driver then got out of the truck and looked under the truck to discover the drive shaft turning. Fearing for his life the driver got back into the truck, and they both kept watching the light as it appeared to be moving closer. They felt that they were in a vacuum of some kind and isolated from the rest of the world. This lasted for about 20 min- utes; then seemed to fade and was over. A car stopped and took the brothers into McGill where they got another U-Haul truck. After unload- ing the disabled truck they had to shove it off the highway, as the back wheels would not move. Lewis Sandberg, owner of the U- Haul outlet in Ely, said that the entire rear end of the witnesses' U-Haul truck had to be replaced — the tires, the rear axle, the outside housing, and the gears, \"which were all messed up. The rear end was beyond repair. The back axle was twisted right off. When our tow truck lifted up the back of the truck, the rear wheels just fell right off! Those men stopped that truck just in time.\" The driver of the damaged truck said that when the truck had been hit by the blast of air, he felt that the truck had been lifted off the ground. \"It was floating slightly off the highway in the air,\" he said. \"None of the wheels were touching the highway.\" When the transmission selector skipped into \"neutral,\" the truck swayed in the air, he said, and the vehicle came smoothly to a stop without skidding. \"There I was alone in the middle of the night of the 17th on a very lonely road with this thing following me,\" Eric Marks said. \"It was like a flat plate with a bell-shaped dome on it. I was nervous ... terrified to be more exact. The bell shape of the UFO glowed like a million car lights and it appeared to be suspended on many pencil rays of bright white light beamed towards the ground. I was going down a steep hill near Wark- worth (New Zealand) but it felt as MUFON UFO Journal, No. 250, February 1989"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"though something was holding the car back,\" Marks explained. \"I put my foot flat to the boards but the car wouldn't go over 45 miles an hour. The UFO must have been exerting some type of force field ... but at the bottom of the hill I was able to accel- erate away at top speed.\" Clay Knight was the only witness to a series of three landings and takeoffs by what he described as a silvery object with flashing red or orange lights. The landings began about 4:30 a.m. on the 18th while the rest of his family was asleep, and the oject made a \"high-pitched whistling noise.\" Knight, a dairyman, was get- ting his herd out for the first milking of the day at that time. The UFO frightened his cattle, causing them to scatter. It also caused their milk pro- duction to fall off about 100 pounds. In the series of three takeoffs, Knight said the UFO first rose straight up from his pasture, landed after travel- ing a short distance, took off and landed once again, and then \"went straight up in the air and disappeared.\" On the 19th an astounded police- man tailed a meandering, flame-spew- ing UFO along the outskirts of Rochester, Minnesota as dozens of motorists pulled off the road in bewil- derment. \"I followed the object and kept it in view for about five miles,\" said Officer Jim Preiss. \"I continued to chase the UFO and it started to zoom away. It climbed very rapidly and within six seconds it was out of sight.\" The bizarre pursuit began shortly before midnight as the 28- year-old patrolman was cruising along Highway 52. \"About 1000 feet in front of me I saw this mysterious object with jets of fire coming from under- neath it. I got out of my car for a bet- ter look, and saw the object moving above the road without making a sound. It was about 100 feet off the ground when it started to slowly move away and I decided to chase it.\" After following the UFO for a mile, Preiss pulled off the road to where Jim Kuhlman had parked his truck to gaze at the object. \"Kuhlman looked a bit shaken and said that the craft had passed right over him,\" said Preiss. \"I almost pinched myself to make sure it was happening,\" said Kuhlman, 27-year-old owner of a tow- truck service. \"As it passed over my head, I could clearly see that it had a square base with a dome on top. The craft was about the size of three tow trucks and was traveling about 20 miles an hour. The strangest thing of all was that it had five rows of what appeared to be afterburners like those on jet planes. Six jets of very bright orange flames were spewing out of each row. When it passed about 100 feet over me, it made no noise at all.\" Letters to the Editor... Dear Editor, The subject of UFOs is one that can demonstrably addle the brains of otherwise intelligent, curious people. For me, the case of Jacques Vallee offers a particularly touching exam- ple. My interest in UFOs began in 1964 with a daylight sighting which lasted roughly three minutes. One of the first books I purchased after that event, in an attempt to understand the meaning of what I had observed, was Vallee's Anatomy of a Pheno- menon, a book that remains extremely important in the literature. I eagerly awaited his next work (Challenge to Science) but was sadly disappointed. MUFON UFO Journal, No. 250, February 1989 It seemed to me to be a fairly irrele- vant critique of the work of Aime Michel, and I wondered why the book had been written in the first place; it has since been dropped from most lists of serious works on the subject of UFOs. Passport to Magonia was next, but a strange tone now seemed to be present — an odd confluence of UFO case studies, free-wheeling speculation and folklore of obviously uncertain authenticity. The resulting stew was nearly indigestible. Eventu- ally Messengers of Deception arrived, a work that for me finally moved into the area of incoherence. A paranoid tone was its sine qua non, while clear, logical, scientific consistency had all but disappeared. Originally I had regarded Vallee as something of a younger Allen Hynek, but now he seemed more like a Gallic John Keel. Messengers of Deception was a truly bizarre book. Its basic problem can be stated this way: Let us say a man awakes in the night hearing whispered voices. He wonders if it's a burglar, a ghost, or if he's just \"hear- ing things.\" Should he phone the police, should he summon an exorcist or possibly make an appointment with a psychiatrist? Vallee intervenes and announces that it makes virtually no difference which solution to the problem he entertains. The whispered voices are \"a control system.\" The nature of this \"control system\" and its ultimate purposes are all but irrelevant; the most important fact is that it is a control system. Thus the man is offered no help with regard to his problem as he perceives it — are thieves stealing from him or endan- gering his life? Is he having some kind of mental breakdown? Are there \"extra-terrestrial ghosts\" in his life, with their own possibly disturbing agenda? He needs to know! But Val- lee, the UFO expert, offers only dark and contrived hints about deception and control and goes about his busi- ness. Messengers of Deception was a sad and dispiriting performance. And now comes Vallee's interview in the May MUFON Journal. Research- ers like Dr. David Jacobs and myself among others are assailed (anonym- ously) for not possessing certain aca- demic credentials, and for \"messing with the minds of impressionable wit- nesses\" in UFO cases. Philip Klass is even praised indirectly for, having helped to \"clean up\" our abduction research. Now, I have always been open to helpful criticism from any source, and am sorry Vallee never bothered to contact me personally, if he had reservations about my work. I am saddened that a one-time colleague chose to adopt the Klassic method of skipping the bother of interviews and discussion simply to attack a per- ceived adversary in print. I do not have to defend myself against Vallee's uninformed charges. I will not list the 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"psychiatrists and psychologists I use as consultants in my research, as it is unlikely that Vallee, a hermetic com- puter expert and sci-fi novelist, knows much about the mental health field in general, and its New York practition- ers in particular. But it is worth men- tioning that in addition, three psy- chologists, two psychiatrists and rough- ly ten psychotherapists have come to me, as abductees, for hypnosis, and are extremely supportive of my work. Vallee's interview reads, alas, like the bitter retrospective view of a man who started well but is ending badly. He is obviously a highly intelligent and gifted man. His first book nearly a quarter of a century back made a major and lasting contribution. His apparent loss to serious UFO research is truly unfortunate. — Budd Hopkins New York Dear Editor, I was disheartened to read Jacques Vallee's remarks about abductions and UFO history in the May issue of the Journal, and I believe that they deserve a reply. Vallee's comments about the use of hypnosis in abduction research are not well informed. Instead of attempt- ing to find out the nature of the actual methodologies employed by \"artists and college professors,\" he predicates his remarks, in part, on the idea that Budd Hopkins and I are \"untrained in this matter\" and that we \"mess with the minds of impres- sionable witnesses.\" Although I can- not speak for other investigators (and Vallee might be quite right about oth- ers), I can say that both Budd Hop- kins and I are extraordinarily careful about how we conduct our hypnotic sessions and our primary concern is the well-being of the abductee above all else. To this end we have sought the advice of psychologists and psy- chiatrists on how to help abductees suffering from the effects of abduc- tions. We have painstakingly worked out a methodology of recovering information that causes the least amount of disturbance for the subject and we have striven to help abduc- tees come to terms with the enormity of the events that have befallen them. 18 In addition, all of my subjects are meticulously briefed both verbally and in written form on the negatives and pitfalls of memory recovery through hypnosis. I am very selective about who I take on to work with. I work closely with a psychologist who has seen several of my subjects inde- pendently. I have had four individuals referred to me by psychotherapists and I have instructed psychologists and psychiatrists on how to conduct hypnotic regressions of abductees. I understand Vallee's concern for the abductee's welfare, but his lack of knowledge about the specifics of our abduction research allows him to fall prey to debunkers' charges without having personal knowledge about what is happening, as evidenced by his unfortunate remarks about Phil Klass having to \"clean up\" after UFO researchers. Vallee's theories about UFO his- tory and historians also need com- ment. He states that his research was a \"key factor\" in changing J. Allen Hynek's mind about UFOs toward a more positive stance. It might well have been a factor but interviews with Hynek and Hynek's own written and verbal analyses of his changing viewpoints do not admit to it being a \"key\" factor. Vallee says that the most important events were occur- ring behind the scenes and points to Hynek's work with Fred Beckman and William Powers as an example. While it is true that this story remains to be told, Hynek's transformation was part of a process of historical change that began quite a bit before he met Vallee. As is well known, as early as 1953 Hynek began to think that the subject needed more scien- tific investigation. By 1964, according to his oft-stated admission, the Socor- ro had fairly well convinced him of the UFOs' anomalous nature. By 1966 he was emerging as a public advocate for that stance. Vallee also states that because Hynek \"found no convincing scientific evidence for the existence of UFOs, ...he remained skeptical.\" If by this Vallee means that Hynek was skepti- cal of the existence of UFOs as arti- facts of nonterrestrial intelligence, then he is in error. Hynek devoted the last fifteen years of his life to pur- suing the UFO mystery. His personal theories privately stated many times to me and to others about the origin of UFOs were not only based on their nonterrestrial origin, but they were considerably more \"far out\" than most of his contemporaries were willing to go. All of his conversations with me and many others point to the fact that there was not a shred of doubt in Hynek's mind about the anomalous and nonterrestrial origin of UFOs. If Vallee has something else to offer on this point I think that we would all welcome an article by him detailing the evolution and impact of Hynek's ideas during this fascinating period. Vallee says that James McDonald's public stance in some way led to the establishment of the Condon Com- mittee. In fact, McDonald did not \"go public\" until well after the February, 1966, O'Brien Committee had recom- mended that universities study the UFO problem. Nor did he go public until after the April 1966 House Hear- ings in which the Secretary of the Air Force was urged to implement these recommendations. When he finally did go public, the processes which led to the Condon Committee were already well underway. Finally, Vallee is puzzled by why historians have concentrated on the House hearings instead of what was happening with Hynek's study group. I am not exactly sure what Vallee had in mind by this puzzling statement, but he could not have possibly meant that it is of only minor importance in UFO history when the House of Representatives of the United States Congress holds a public hearing on unidentified flying objects that directly leads to the establishment of the most important scientific committee to study the subject to date, and that in turn leads directly to the decision by the United States Air Force to abandon its official UFO investiga- tions project. I think that some of the problems with Vallee's interview were that in an off-the-cuff discussion one has a ten- dency to say things that might have a specific verbal meaning but when written they can take on a very differ- MUFON UFO Journal, No. 250, February 1989"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"ferent meaning. If this is the case then I think we can all learn from this incident that in granting interviews, always demand to see and make changes in the finished article as part of the price of the interview. — David Jacobs, Ph.D. Wyndmoor, PA Dear Editor: The recent publication of my inter- view with Linda Strand in the MUFON Journal has elicited violent reactions from Budd Hopkins and David Jac- obs, although neither one of them was personally taken to task in the interview. Their reaction is remarka- ble for what it reveals about the cur- rent state of the UFO research community, of which both men are influential members. While UFO re- search needs to attract the open par- ticipation of professional scientists, it reacts to the first hint of criticism by lashing out in personal attacks against the person voicing the concern, in- stead of addressing the issue at hand. I believe we should all be worried about this problem, and we should take steps to correct it. David Jacobs assures us that in his hypnotic practice he works closely with a psychologist, and that both he and Budd seek the advice and coun- sel of professional psychiatrists. Budd is angry at me for not asking him personally to explain his methods. Both of these agruments miss the point. In my view, the regression should never be conducted by indi- viduals who hold strong personal beliefs about the nature of the expe- rience they are investigating, and who are searching for confirmation of their specific interpretation of the phenomenon. Too often UFO researchers have used hypnosis to force the pheno- menon into a preconceived pattern. For instance, in 1987 Budd Hopkins appeared with Lee Spiegel on the WABC television \"Good Morning New York.\" He brought with him one of the witnesses he had studied under hypnotic regression, a very sincere young man named Michael Bershad, and he stated in response to ques- tions by Lee and another interviewer: \"in this case, the physical examina- MUFON UFO Journal, No. 250, February 1988 tion he went through involved stimu- lation of nerves down the right leg from his hip ...\" Yet Bershad repeated several times, on camera: \"I'm not sure it happened ...\" \"I'm not sure I was abducted!\" What kind of scien- tific investigation is this? I am not as naive as Budd Hopkins would like your readers to believe on the use of hypnosis in this research. As a member of the Board of Consul- tants of the Institute for Advanced Psychology I have researched care- fully under what minimum standards hypnosis would be acceptable in Court. None of the hypnotic regres- sions I have seen coming from the recent series of abduction investiga- tions would meet these standards. I, too, have consulted with several pro- fessionals in this area. Their approach has been cautious and extremely skeptical of the type of \"evidence\" claimed by Hopkins. One M.D. psy- chiatrist who is trained in the use of hypnosis declined to perform a regres : sion on a witness I brought to him because he felt he knew too much about the UFO phenomenon and had reached a personal conclusion about it, a fact which he felt disqualified him. In another case I am currently investigating, which involves a possi- ble abduction from a car when the witness was a child, the regression in which I participated was conducted by two doctors, with on-camera record- ing of the entire session and of sev- . eral physiological variables, but it was felt that professional standards did not permit pursuing the sessions in the absence of a therapy contract with the witness. In view of these concerns on the part of professionals of hypnosis, I am extremely surprised to see that so many UFO researchers, armed only with their enthusiasm, are charging ahead with the kind of exploration into the minds of the wit- nesses which Hopkins and Jacobs describe. To close this part of the discussion, let me say again for the record that I believe the \"abductees\" are telling the truth as they experience it, that there is a genuine phenomenon involved in the abductions (although it is not necessarily extraterrestrial) and that it should be a high-priority concern for our community to develop a clean, reliable, safe way to study it. Let me now turn to the other points raised in the two letters. Regarding Budd Hopkins' attacks on Challenge to Science, I can only say that the book went through four mass paperback editions in the U.S. alone after the hardcover had gone out of print, that it was translated into several languages, that it was used as the basis for the often-quoted chapter on UFOs in the Air Force Physics Handbook, where two of my figures are reprinted, and that it was recommended by Margaret Mead as the most important book she had read on the subject. If it has become obsolete after twenty years I can only say, sorry Budd, I'll try to do better next time! In discussing Hynek's views during the key period of 1963 to 1966 David Jacobs is in the unusual position of a presumably objective professional his- torian telling me, a witness and partic- ipant in the events, what happened in my own life. Allen Hynek invited me to join him at Northwestern Univer- sity in the Fall of 1963 so that we could work together on the UFO problem. I brought my data-base with me, so that the European UFO files could be confronted with the Ameri- can data for the first time. I was with him almost daily in the ensuing years, through the Socorro investigation, the arguments with McDonald and the Condon briefings. Several of Allen's position papers were written in collaboration with me and were typed on my typewriter. I still have the handwritten drafts. Today my file of correspondence with him bulges to a barely manageable volume. Yet David never interviewed me about that period. He never consulted my private correspondence, nor did he see the research proposals Hynek and I submitted to the Air Force. Perhaps it is better to leave things as they are. Although I may decide to publish my own documented account of that phase of UFO research some day, I have no intention of violating Hynek's confidence during our years of collaboration, when we shared many facts'and many contacts that 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"have never been made public. I am glad that Dave acknowledges that my intense work with Allen during that period \"may have been a factor\" in his changing perception of the phenome- non. I do agree with Dave that \"there was not a shred of doubt in Hynek's mind about the anomalous origin of UFOs.\" I never said that Hynek thought anything else. I did choose my words carefully during my inter- view with Linda Strand. If Dave refers to the text he will see that I stated, in the context of those early years with Allen at Northwestern, that he never found convincing evidence for the existence of UFOs. There is no con- tradiction here. Surely it is possible for a scientist to believe in the anom- alous origin of a phenomenon and at the same time to recognize that he does not have the kind of final proof he could take before a committee of the National Academy of Sciences. Are we in a different situation today? I respect both Budd and Dave too much to pursue the debate at the level of personal vindictiveness they have unfortunately chosen. In the past I have engaged in lively debates in print with such UFO debunkers as Menzel and Klass, but I have never experienced the kind of venom con- veyed by these letters from fellow ufologists. If the intended message is that the contribution I can make in UFO research is not welcome, that message is clearly understood. In their view I should have dropped out after publishing Anatomy of a Phe- nomenon. The field would certainly be a lot simpler today if we could turn back the clock to 1965. We could all ignore the masses of disturb- ing historical material brought to light by Passport to Magonia, the psychic implications stressed in Invisible Col- lege, and the manipulation of both the UFO groups and some of the sightings exposed in Messengers of Deception. I can only assure David Jacobs that I have not \"increasingly aban- doned empirical evidence.\" If I have the opportunity to continue to pub- lish my work in spite of the antago- nism manifested by these two col- 20 leagues, perhaps they will eventually agree with me that the phenomenon is more complex, more interesting and more profound than any of us has ever dreamt. Then, perhaps, the pointless quarrels of today will be forgotten, and we can be friends again, as we should be — fellow explorers of a reality that dwarfs all of our pet theories. — Jacques Vallee San Francisco Readers may wish to consult bai- lee's original interview (May 1988 JournalJ which is scheduled to be reprinted in UFO Magazine and also in the paperback edition of Dimen- sions: A Casebook of Alien Contact. A reprint of Vallee's Challenge to Science will be released by Ballantine in April 1989. Dear Editor: Judging from his letter in the December issue of the MUFON UFO Journal, Dennis Stillings remains res- olute in his determination to occupy the heights of foolishness. Far be it for me to try to bring him down. Stillings complains about my obser- vation that it is foolish to try to explain an unknown with another unknown. It is even worse, I might add, to try to explain an unknown with the imaginary. There is no evi- dence whatever for the existence of macropsychokinesis, as Stillings in effect concedes by not addressing the issue. Stillings' beloved materialized psychisms belong more properly out- side the arena of academic parapsy- chology (which has little if anything to say about them) and inside the arena of occultism (which, being as unbound as Stillings by so lowly a concern as \"evidence,\" has much to say on the subject). Stillings to the. contrary, by the way, Jung specifically rejected the notion of materialized psychisms —to which I assume (judging from corres- pondence I've had with Stillings on the subject) he is referring when he writes that Jung \"speculated that it might well be that some UFO phen- omena are of psychic origin.\" Stillings further imagines that I have a \"personal need for UFOs to be of extraterrestrial origin\" — again, of course, offering no evidence. In reality, I have repeatedly stated (e.g., IUR, September/October 1985, and my MUFON Proceedings paper, \"Fall and Rise of the ET Hypothesis,\" which Stillings seems not to have read in its entirety) that the ET hypothesis is, from an emotional point of view, the least desirable of all UFO explanations. In fact, the emo- tional rejection of the ET hypothesis by debunkers, occultists and others is understandable; after all, ET visitation has all kinds of unsettling implications which even many ufologists have not considered. It is easy to see why an occultist like Stillings would want to imagine a relatively safe phenomenon like macropsychokinesis, since \"mater- ialized psychisms\" at least are (one assumes) in some sense under our control, which cannot be said of potentially threatening somebodies with an advanced technology with which they can do anything, presumably, they wish. Stillings manages to bring in the hoary charge that ET proponents are \"religious\" — always a sure sign that one is losing the argument. Even Phil Klass knows better than that. Klass, for all that his specific interpretations are open to dispute, knows at least that the argument about ET visitation is over evidence,- which (whether suf- ficient to prove the case or not) indisputably exists; theological inter- pretations or attacks are simply irrele- vant to the argument, except to the most desperate. (Rather than repeat myself, I refer readers to my \"Ufolo- gists and the Extraterrestrial Hypothe- sis,\" June 1988 MUFON UFO Jour- nal.) Evidence, alas, never enters into Stillings' formulations, nor does actual investigation of actual UFO cases. If anything, Stillings acts as if he were speaking from revealed wisdom — the basis, of course, of religious belief. Meanwhile, not just ufologists but military officers, scientists, psy- chologists and others who have con- cerned themselves with the evidence, by investigating and documenting it, have been uniformly puzzled by ever- ything from radar-visual cases to physical-trace incidents to close en- counters. It is also worth pointing out, as MUFON UFO Journal, No. 250, February 1989"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Prof. Michael Swords has shown in three excellent papers, that ufologists' conclusions about the nature of ETI are entirely consistent with state-of- the-art exobiological thinking on the same subject. Moreover, a to-be- published study of the abduction phenomenon by a psychiatrist with investigative experience rejects as inadequate all psychological explana- tions so far proposed — a view endorsed by just about all other mental-health professionals who have bestirred themselves from the arm- chair on this matter. In his massive study of the phenomenon, folklorist Eddie Bullard .conclusively falsified, among other notions, the loony \"birth- trauma hypothesis\" (once, and for all I know still, championed by Stillings) and documented the extraordinarily puzzling nature of the abduction ex- perience. Stillings' response to this, as his various writings attest, is to call ufol- ogists nasty names and to accuse them of assorted thought crimes of which they are mostly innocent. The real source of his unhappiness is their well-founded skepticism of his pecul- iar ideas about the UFO phenomenon. I leave Stillings to his occult specu- lations. I prefer the evidence, disturb- ing as its implications seem to be. I hope that in the end we will find that ET visitation is not the answer. — Jerome Clark Evanston, IL Dear Editor, I haven't met Mr. Robert Baker, and quite frankly, don't care to ... at least not from a professional stand- point. His obvious panic at the Lin- coln Symposium, which you refer to in the October issue of The Journal, was quite disturbing. It's dishearten- ing to think that this man represents an official organization, the CSICOP. Now, I respect and listen to any opinions put forth by UFO researchers, whether they be to prove the phe- nomenon exists or state to the con- trary, but Mr. Baker's actions at the conference appear unwarranted. His frequent outbursts, wild accusations, and twisted interpretations at the proceedings that you mention make me a little uneasy. Are all CSICOP members irrational, obstinate know-it- alls? I sincerely hope not. Any person that seems oblivious to any incongru- ous assertions by others is one to be wary of in my book. His speedy rat- tling raises a few questions about his stability and reliability in euer discuss- ing the phenomenon objectively. It's always sad when someone gets hurt when dealing with this'Contro- versial subject, but it appears Mr. Baker has made his own bed. — Eric Grant Manchester, NH / appreciate your letter and sup- port. Dr. Baker and I have since engaged in a rather lively correspon- dence in which he admitted to (and apologized for) a moment of intem- perateness and I agreed to apologize for the tone and content of some of my published remarks as well. It's doubtful we'll be collaborating on any forthcoming articles or exchanging annual birthday greetings, but I think it safe to say we better understand one another now and have agreed to put the incident behind us. I should also point out that Dr. Baker, like myself, is a private citizen and not a public spokesman for CSICOP — the Committee for the Scientific Investi- gation of Claims of the Paranormal — any more than I am a public spo- kesperson for MUFON. Obviously, it behooves us all to regard one another as individuals rather than as faceless factotums of any organization or immutable mindset. — Editor Dear Editor: I protest Bob Cribble's use of the words \"Extraterrestrial\" and \"E.T.\" to describe unidentified entities which witnesses have reported throughout the years. (\"Looking Back,\" MUFON UFO Journal, Dec. 1988, pp 14-16.) The entities observed may very well have been from another planet, but then again it is entirely possible that they were not. Until we know more, and in an effort to improve our scientific and journalistic credibility, perhaps we'd better hedge our bets. — Jennie Zeidman Columbus, OH Dear Editor: \"Theories as Zecharia Sitchin pro- posed\" are listed as Scenario A by Dr. M. Swords (Extraterrestrial Hybrid- ization Unlikely,\" MUFON Journal, November 1988) that might allow crossbreeding between Aliens and humans. But since we.are also akin to animals and indeed to all life on .Earth, the kinship had to begin some 3 l / 2 billion years ago, which Dr. Swords finds improbable as \"Aliens\" did not exist then.

My writings, and especially Book I of THE EARTH CHRONICLES titled The 12th Planet, are based primarily on Sumerian texts that have been unearthed by archaeologists. These texts, of which the early chapters of Genesis are concise versions, offer a sophisticated astronomy and cosmo- gony, of Evolution and Creation, as well as of space travel in prehistory. Earth, they tell us, is a remaining half of a larger planet (\"Tiamat\") that was broken up in a celestial collision with an invading planet (\"Nibiru\"). The \"seed of life\" was brought into the solar system and imparted to Earth by Nibiru. It happened when the solar system was young — some 3^-4 billion years ago. Evolution then proceeded on both Nibiru and Earth from the same seed of life, but with a somewhat earlier start on Nibiru. About 450,000 years ago, the Anun- naki (\"Those Who From Heaven To Earth Came\") - the Bible called them Nefilim — came from Nibiru to Earth. How and why is described in the texts and in my books. In need of \"Primitive Workers,\" they combined the genes of their males with the eggs of Apewoman to create The Adam (literally, \"Earthling\"). As all hybrids (e.g. mules) this being could not pro- create. The tale of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden is the story of the second genetic manipulation giv-. ing Homo sapiens the ability to procreate. This double compatibility — first the same genetic \"seed of life\" billions of years ago, then the genetic engi- neering some 300,000 years ago — made it possible for the Nefilim to marry the daughters of Man and have children by them. — Zecharia Sitchin New York 20th Anniversary Year THE NIGHT SKY By Walter N. Webb MUFON Astronomy Consultant February 1989 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Mars, in Aries, remains high in the southern sky at dusk. Shining at 0.8 magnitude, the reddish planet.sets in the NW about midnight. Mars is drawing closer to giant Jupiter, in Taurus, which outshines its ruddy neighbor by nearly 20 times (at magnitude -2.4). Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus (magnitude -3.9) may be glimpsed early in the month, rising only three-quarters of an hour before the Sun. It is very low in the SE at dawn. Jupiter sets in the NW about 1 AM in mid-February. Saturn, in Sagittarius, rises about 4 AM and lies low in the SE at dawn. Total Lunar Eclipse: The full moon enters the Earth's shadow on the morning of the 20th. The early partial phases of the eclipse occur near moonset from the western U.S. Total eclipse happens shortly before or during moonset from Washington, Oregon, northern California, and Alaska. The Moon first contacts the dark umbral shadow at 5:44 AM PST, while totality begins at 6:56. (Times are one hour earlier in Alaska.) Moon Phases: New moon — February 6 First quarter — February 12 Full moon — February 20 Last quarter — February 28 o c 22 The Stars: At 9 PM Orion and the Winter Circle light up the southern sky. While the dim stars of autumn set in the west, the springtime sky symbol Leo the Lion is already up in the east. Ursa Major the Great Bear, which contains the more easily seen Big Dipper, is prominent in the NE. Sirius the Dog Star lies due south during the midevening. It is the bright- est nighttime star in the entire sky because it is both a hot A-type star and one of our nearest stellar neighbors (9 light years distant). The Dog Star also has a tiny telescopic companion called Sirius B or \"the Pup,\" a white dwarf star only twice the size of the Earth yet containing the mass of our Sun. A teaspoonful of the Pup's material would weigh as much as a car if placed on our planet! A white dwarf is a collapsed star near the end of its life — the eventual fate of our own Sun.
