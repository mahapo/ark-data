These characteristics are reponed by witnesses who are, very likely, not completely accurate. Perhaps the turns were not perfectly abrupt, they only appeared to be. Perhaps the objects did not disappear in the sense of material objects vanishing without a trace, perhaps they only appeared to vanish. DECEMBER 1993 NUMBER 308 PAGE 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL The witness saw the UFO traveling north to south past his house on Pensacola Beach. At first he thought it was a \"fat, round-looking cruise missile\" from nearby Lglin Air Force Base. Then it disappeared! P hysics and technology as we know them indi- cate that it is physically impossible for massive objects to make instantaneous right angle turns or to seem to disappear by instantaneous acceleration to a high speed because of a fundamental property of matter called inertia, which is the \"reluctance\" of a massive ob- ject to change its state of motion. Because of inertia, rapid changes in speed require powerful forces. An instanta- neous change in speed along a given direction would re- quire infinite forces. For this reason scientists have \"solved\" the problem of explaining UFO sightings which describe these \"impossibilities\" by rejecting the reports, even though they have been made by credible people. Disappearances in the clear sky have been reported since 1947. The first official reference to the ability of UFOs to disappear by rapid acceleration is in the draft of an intelligence requirements memorandum written for Brigadier General Schulgen by Lt. Col. Garrett in October, 1947.' This memorandum (released to the pub- lic in 1985) was written in response to General Nathan Twining's letter of September 23, 1947, which said that flying saucers are \"real and not visionary or fictitious\" and which outlined reasons for collecting information about flying saucers. 2 Lt. Col. Garrett referred to sight- ings by \"many competent observers including USAF- rated officers\" and listed a number of \"commonly re- ported features that are very significant.\" This list in- cludes \"the ability to suddenly appear without warning as if from an extremely high altitude\" and \"the ability to quickly disappear by high speed or by complete disin- tegration.\" (emphasis added) Sudden appearance and disappearance could be two aspects of the same capa- bility: extremely high acceleration/deceleration: (Note: the suggestion that a flying saucer could disappear by \"complete disintegration\" indicates just how puzzled the top Air Force officers were by the sighting reports.) I n the past some investigators, including one of the authors (Maccabee). have conjectured that an ob- ject accelerating fast enough (traveling many times its own length in a second) might seem to the observer to \"disappear.\" If the observer blinked at the time of the ac- celeration, the object could be out of the observer's central field of view by the time the blink was finished. Up until now there has been no hard evidence to confirm the conjecture. Now, thanks to an astute witness who prefers anonymity, 3 we have a videotape which pro- vides new information related to the question of UFO disappearance. The witness first saw the UFO at about 1:30 PM on March 24, 1993. It was traveling north to south past his house on Pensacola Beach. He thought it was a \"fat, round-looking cruise missile\" from Eglin Air Force Base. 4 (Note: the Navy does occasionally launch real cruise missiles which pass over populated areas along the shore of the Gulf of Mexico near Pensacola, Florida!) A few minutes later he saw another (or the same) one and this time he realized that it wasn't a cruise missile. It was \"crown-shaped with a bottom layer.\"\" 1 Since he had now seen it twice coming from the same direction he decided to try to videotape it if it flew past again. He set up his 8mm videocamera (Sony CCD M8; fixed focus; 29° field of view) on his deck and pointed it in the direction which the \"missile\" had gone. The camera ran for two hours, the duration of the video- tape. Upon reviewing the tape he saw only some heli- copters flying along the beach. The next day he set the camera up again and \"1 went into the house and went to the bathroom. When I started to return to work —about 1:30—I saw the UFO moving fast from the east. The video camera caught it.\" 4 The video of the object lasts for 29 frames—almost one second—and shows an object which moved so fast that its true shape was stretched and distorted by the speed with which it passed from left to right through the field of view of the camera. The actual speed is inde- terminate since the distance was unknown. However, by assuming that the altitude was constant and using pro- jective geometry we determined that the track of the ob- ject was not straight and that, if it was 1,000 ft away when it was first picked up by the camera, then it prob- ably was traveling several thousand miles per hour (pro- portionally faster if at a greater distance). The witness next saw the crown-shaped UFO as it was hovering southeast (about 160° azimuth, 40° ele- vation) of his house on March 31, 1993 at about 2:00 PM. He ran to get his videocamera and three batteries (he didn't know which one was charged). He placed the camera on the railing of his deck to steady it and turned it on. The UFO was substantially motionless. In the video one sees the tops of hazy clouds moving from right to left, whereas the UFO image stays near the center of the field of view. The first battery ran out after about 40 seconds and he quickly replaced it, but the second battery was dead. He replaced that with the third battery and videotaped the UFO for another 9 seconds or so at which time it suddenly disappeared so quickly that the witness was startled and uttered an expletive (deleted). In replaying the video frame by frame the investiga- tors found that the disappearance was actually the result of an extreme acceleration toward the right combined with a loss in contrast against the background sky. The extreme acceleration made the motion impossible to follow with the eye (or camera) and the high speed de- creased the time that the image spent at any point on the PAGE 4 NUMBER 308 DECEMBER 1993"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL The Polaroid picture shows that the crown- shaped UFO is really more like a layer cake, with the top cylindrical layer larger in diameter than the bottom layer. There Is a red \"hole\" in the bottom. focal plane. The decreased image time on the focal plane reduced the contrast with the background sky, making the blurred image very difficult to see on a video monitor. About a week later (April 2, 10:15 AM) the witness again saw the UFO hovering near his house. This time he knew that none of his videocamera batteries were charged, so he ran for his Polaroid 600 camera. He was able to take one picture from an outside stairway looking nearly straight upward at the object before it again \"dis- appeared.\" This shows that the crown-shaped UFO re- ally is more like a layer cake with the top cylindrical layer larger in diameter than the lower layer. There is a \"hole\" in the bottom which is red. Figure 1 shows the full frame picture, which includes a wall and a railing and a blowup of the UFO. Again the distance is not known. If it were 1,000 ft. away then its maximum di- ameter was about 11 ft. The authors independently analyzed the video im- agery. The independent analyses show that there was an extremely rapid acceleration. The specific results re- ported here were obtained using a VHS copy of the 8 mm videotape, a Sony \"shuttle\"-type VTR and a 13-inch TV monitor. The images of the UFO are compact and very easy to see up to the point where the acceleration becomes large. There is a bright spot, which is probably a glint caused by sunlight reflected from the object, and darker areas near the bottom (darker than the back- ground sky). The image has a compact, nearly circular shape with a width and height of 4 - 5 mm on the mon- itor screen. T ests carried out by investigators Bland Pugh and Gary Watson provided the effective focal length (EFL) of the camera-monitor combination: 535 mm. The size, i, of the image therefore corresponds to an an- gular size of i/EFL = 0.008-0.009 radians. Multiplying the angular size in radians by the distance gives the ac- tual size as measured transverse to the line of sight. Unfortunately there was no triangulation during this sighting, so the actual distance is not known. However, if the object were 1.000 ft. away, then it was 8-9 ft. wide, and it was proportionally larger or smaller as the assumed distance is made larger or smaller. Once the acceleration begins the images become stretched and difficult to see because of the contrast re- duction discussed above. In spite of the difficulty in determining the boundaries of the blurred images, mea- surements were made of the distance from the right side of the object in the last stationary frame to the rightmost end of each succeeding image after the ac- celeration started. These measurements provide esti- mates of the (angular) distance traveled each frame time of 1/30 second. (Experiments with the camera confirm that it has a 1/30 sec. exposure time at 30 frames per sec- ond). These distances increase as time goes on. There are five frames of data before the object leaves the field of view. The distance of the right edge of each image relative to the right side of the image in the last stationary frame is plotted in Figure 2. The difficulty in determining the exact location of the right end of each elongated image is indicated by the vertical line (error bar) at each data point. The continually increasing lengths of the blurred images indicate that the object underwent an unusually large acceleration. In order to determine the nature of the acceleration the data were plotted on log-log paper: log (x) vs log (t), where x (vertical axis) is the distance in mm starting at the right side of the image in the last station- ary frame and t is the time in seconds (each frame time is 0.033 seconds). The data, except for the first point, are quite well represented by a straight line with a slope of 2. This line corresponds to the mathematical relation, x = At 2 . This is also mathematically equivalent to the \"constant acceleration law,\" x = (1/2 )at 2 when we set A = (l/2)a, and where a is \"the acceleration constant.\" (Note: the acceleration law, with a = 32 ft/sec 2 , or 9.8 me- ters/sec 2 , describes how massive objects fall near the sur- face of the earth, ignoring the effects of air resistance.) The solid line through the data points in Figure 2 provides an estimate of the acceleration. The slope of the line corresponds to a = 8,500 mm/sec 2 on the TV screen. Combining this with EFL = 535 mm yields an angular acceleration of 15.9 rad/sec 2 transverse lo the line of sight. In order to relate this to an actual speed one must know the distance. Since the distance is not known, one must assume a distance in order to estimate the ac- celeration. If the distance were only 1,000 ft. this would be 15.900 ft/sec : or about 500 times the acceleration of gravity! (If the object was moving some amount to- ward or away from the camera then the actual accelera- tion was greater than the value estimated here.) If the distance were not 1,000 ft. the acceleration would be larger or smaller in proportion to the assumed distance (e.g., 31,800 ft/sec 2 at 2,000 ft). Motion which obeys the constant acceleration law is also consistent with the following velocity equation: v = at, where v is the velocity. Hence after three frames (3/30 = 0.1 sec) the angular velocity was about 1.59 rad/sec. At 1,000 ft. this would correspond to 1,590 ft/sec, greater than the speed of sound at sea level (1,090 ft/sec). By the time the object left the screen after 5 frames (5/30 = 1/6 sec) it was moving at about 2.65 rad/sec or 2,650 ft/sec if 1,000 ft. away and propor- tionally larger or smaller if it was at a greater or lesser distance. DECEMBER 1993 NUMBER 308 PAGES"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Such extreme acceleration Immediately raises several questions. How was the acceleration achieved in the absence of any apparent means of propulsion (no rocket blasts, no explosions, no obvious electric or magnetic phenomena)? Why was there no noise associated with the departure (engine noise, sonic boom)? What happened to the occupants, If any? Such extreme acceleration immediately raises several questions. How was the acceleration achieved in the absence of any apparent means of propulsion (no rocket blasts, no explosions, no obvious electric or magnetic phenomena)? Why was there no noise associated with the departure (engine noise, sonic boom)? What hap- pened to the occupants, if any? These are questions which have been asked repeatedly over the last nearly fifty years. Because these questions have been based on visual observations of possibly questionable accuracy they have generally been ignored by scientists. But now, with some \"hard\" data to go on, it appears that we must confront the ridiculous (by our standards) evidence that phenomenal acceleration without the usual apparent ac- tion-reaction is possible. So far as we know, acceleration is a result of the ap- plication of a force to an object. However, a force does not \"act alone:\" a force on one object requires an \"equal and opposite\" force on some other object. This is the fa- mous \"action-reaction\" principle of Isaac Newton. Rockets work because the hot gas molecules, rapidly ex- panding out through the rear of the rocket, push hard— exert a force—on the rocket body before they are ejected. Firing a bullet out of a gun is another example of action-reaction. Over a short distance in the barrel (inches) the force of expanding hot gases (the exploding gunpowder) accelerates the bullet to velocities so great that the bullet cannot be seen as it leaves the muzzle. If the barrel of a gun were transparent so you could watch what happens, you would see the bullet \"disappear\"' from the barrel as the gun itself kicked backward. The examples of the action-reaction principle at work in our flying machines should be contrasted with the video image of the UFO acceleration: there is no evi- dence of action-reaction occurring...no propellers, no jet exhaust...nothing. Yet, the fact that the UFO accel- erated somewhat uniformly, rather than just instantan- taneously achieving a high travel velocity, suggests that a force was applied. Where, then, did the UFO get the force to accelerate? What did it push against? Was there something invisible in the sky pulling or pushing it? Did it have an invisible jet-like exhaust? Trying to answer questions such as these have led theorists to speculate that the UFO uses magnetic fields to push against the earth's magnetic field. However, even if one were to assume that ex- tremely high fields could be created by the UFO, this mode of propulsion is questionable because of the dipole or multipole nature of magnetic fields (one tends to get rotation about an axis rather than linear motion of the magnetic body). Other suggestions are even more bizarre. If the iner- tial mass were reduced a smaller force could produce the same acceleration. If it were possible to reduce the in- ertial mass to near zero, then a small amount of ejected matter or even photons of light (a light beam) could propel an object. Alternatively, some people have pro- posed warping space or travel into another dimension or time travel. Unfortunately, \"reduction of inertial mass,\" \"space warp,\" \"travel into another dimension,\" \"time travel,\" travel to a \"higher plane of existence,\" and other similar terms have no operational meaning...that is, no one knows how to do these things, or even if they can be done. R eturning to the \"right angle turns\" mentioned at the beginning of this paper, the discovery that UFOs have the capability of extreme acceleration provides a possible explanation for the abrupt changes in direc- tion that have been reported. To change direction the UFO would apply to itself, in some way, a decelerating force to arrest its motion in one direction while applying to itself an accelerating force for a sufficient time to achieve the desired speed in the new direction. These forces would be of such extreme magnitude that to the human observer it would appear that the UFO \"instan- taneously\" changed direction. This videotape is not the only evidence of extreme UFO acceleration. Three previous still photos, all taken by Ed Walters in Gulf Breeze, Florida, have evidence of UFO acceleration. The UFOs in two of these (January 24, 1988 and March 8, 1988) were seen by Ed alone.- Both of these photos have the image of an \"Ed-type\" ob- ject which has linear streaks upward to the top of the picture, as if the object zoomed upward while the cam- era shutter was open. The linear streaks decrease in brightness in the upward direction indicating an accel- eration of the craft. The light depicted in Ed's photo of January 8, 1990 was seen at the same time by eight or so other wit- nesses. 6 The witnesses reported that the light was at the center of a much larger circular object which was seen as a silhouette against a background of dull grey cloud cover. The object would alternately hover and then dart to a new location not far away and hover again. Ed's photo shows an overexposed compact image with a thick line extending rightward to the edge of the photo. Since the camera was on a tripod the thick line must have been made by the light as the object darted away to the right. The width and brightness of the thick line diminish with distance along its length, consistent with the line being the image of an accelerating light.

A newly acquired video shows a UFO \"disappearing.\" This video provides, for the first time, reasonably clear evidence that UFOs are capable of ex- treme acceleration and speed. The video does not answer the question of how the acceleration and speed were achieved. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors thank the witness for providing the videos and the photo.

In fact, com- pared to 127 control subjects, the UFO observers scored slightly higher in intelligence. Most of the UFO subjects were also described as relatively content and anxiety free. Authors of the paper, which was published in the November issue of the Journal of Abnormal Psychology, were Nicholas Spanos, Patricia Cross, Kirby Dickson and Susan DuBreuil. The study was conducted at Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario. TABLOID TV According to the Wall Street Journal, the Weekly World News, sister tabloid to the National Enquirer, may soon have its own TV series devoted to UFOs, aliens and other \"far out\" subjects, which can hardly bode well for scientific ufology. The program is a joint production between the Enquirer/Star Group, Inc. and Brandon Tartikoff, for- mer chairman of Paramount and NBC-TV'S Entertainment unit. Two half-hour segments, taped in Florida in November, have been purchased by CBS for airing sometime next year. Depending on ratings, the program might become a regular series. GOVERNMENT SECRECY As part of the Clinton administration's promise of a more \"open\" government, the Energy Department re- vealed that 204 previously unannounced nuclear tests had been conducted in Nevada between 1963 and 1990. The Department also said that it had 32 million documents awaiting declassification review. DECEMBER 1993 NUMBER 308 PAGE 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL WRITING RIGHT How To Avoid Common Grammar And Usage Errors In UFO Reports By Budd Hopkins G eorge Bernard Shaw once wrote that whenever an Englishman speaks, his accent makes an- other Englishman hate him. He was referring, of course, to the upper-class snobbism and the underclass resentment so deeply embedded in British society, dis- tinctions which language and accent so vividly reveal. For those of us privileged to have grown up here in the United States, such class distinctions are usually more a matter of embarrassment than pride. However, damaging prejudicial distinctions based on race, gender and level of educational attainment ob- viously do exist here in our country. The last prejudice — regarding a person's educational background — can be less of a handicap if one learns to write and speak well. It is crucial to avoid the many common errors that point to educational inadequacies. No matter how clear the import of one's message, certain mistakes of grammar and usage can powerfully undercut its effec- tiveness. The skeptics almost always speak well, with the air of a solid education behind them. The problem is that their ideas and reasoning are flawed and their belief systems are absurdly rigid. All too often UFO investigators have this situation backwards: their reasoning is logical, their ideas incisive and their belief systems flexible; it is only their style of presentation which seems less than solid. And so I offer this piece with the hope that this condition can be ameliorated and that we can learn to avoid a few common errors when reports are compiled and lectures prepared. The following is a mock UFO sighting account, containing some of the most frequently committed errors: A REPORT ON A UFO PHENOMENA OVER SAN DIEGO This important sighting occurred on October 31, 1993. and the data it provides is very valuable. The story begins about 11:00 p.m. when Mr. Joseph Smith was sitting in his living room watching TV. Then he sud- denly jumped, looked out the window and seen a large, red, oval-like object over the nearby trees. It didn't move — it just hoovered there while he watched in amazement. The UFO had red and yellow and blue ro- tating lights moving around its center. Mr. Smith called a neighbor, Mr. Brown, and asked him to look out his window because he needed someone to collaborate his amazing story. A minute or so later Mr. Brown sees the huge craft from his front porch and described it the same way as Mr. Smith. He was able to run outside because he had just came downstairs to answer the phone; thus he was able to see the object clearly before it shot off at a terrific speed. Mr. Smith told me that Mr. Brown's description of the craft was exactly like his; they both saw the same thing. Though neither man spoke to any other neighbors about their joint sighting, Mr. Smith told me that he didn't want me to get the wrong idea. He wasn't trying to infer that there weren't other witnesses; he was sure that other people would of had to have seen such a huge and brightly-lighted-up UFO. This is truely a dramatic and strange phenomena. Mr. Smith and Mr. Brown — and probably some of their neighbors — are as much amazed by it as me. Neither the appearance of such a large, round, well- lighted up object, nor when it speeded off so incredibly fast are in any way like the behavior of any known air- craft. W hew! Now to repair the damage. First, the title of the sample report, and one of the most common errors UFO researchers make. Phenomenon is the sin- gular form of the word, and phenomena is the plural. Thus, one refers to the crop circle phenomenon and to abductions and sightings as UFO phenomena. This is the kind of error which immediately earns the innocent UFO researcher the absolute contempt of the conven- tional scientist. In the first sentence another error appears, but it is one that is so common as to be acceptable in many quarters. Technically, datum is the singular form and data is the plural. Thus, we should say \"these data\" or \"this datum\" if we are to be strictly correct. Scientists characteristi- cally employ these usages, though data as a singular form is more common with the public at large. Decide, when you write or speak, which group you're address- ing, and use the form which seems the more appropriate. Next, when one presents a narrative, decide on either the present or past tense and stick with it. \"The story be- gins...\" should continue \"... and Mr. Smith is sitting...\" (not was sitting). \"...He jumps...\" (not jumped), and so on. Simple consistency is the rule. Next, a grating but all too common problem of tense: \"he seen.'\" The proper usage for the past tense is \"he saw.\" \"I, you, he, she, they saw.\" The past perfect tense is \"I, you, he, she, they had seen.\" Oval-like is another, different kind of error. Oval is an adjective and as such it is sufficient merely to say \"an oval object.\" \"Hoovered\" is, of course a misspelling — not the subject of this piece —but I include it here, misspelled, PAGES NUMBER 308 DECEMBER 1993"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL to suggest a common mispronunciation. Hover should be pronounced like lover, but never like hoover. If you de- scribe a craft as hoovering, you may get an unexpected chuckle because you're using the popular English term for cleaning a carpet. A less than clear description comes next, and I offer it as an example of the need to reduce the ambiguities in our accounts. The term rotating lights implies lights that spin on their centers, the way a helicopter's rotor spins. If you mean to describe the lights as seeming to travel around the circumference of a UFO, then you should say the lights rotate around the ship. They are not, within themselves, rotating lights. Next, an extremely embarrassing, but all-too-common error, the use of collaborate when you mean corrobo- rate. To collaborate means \"to work together\" or \"to co- operate treacherously.\" Thus, if Mr. Smith and Mr. Brown collaborate on their story, cooperative planning is implied and that suggests a hoax. On the other hand, to corroborate means \"to confirm\" or \"to make more certain.\" Here, since the independent accounts of the two witnesses support one another, the proper word is cor- roborate. In the second paragraph there is, again, a painful mix of present and past tenses. Worse, in the second sen- tence we read that Mr. Brown \"had just came down- stairs.\" The proper usage is, of course, Mr. Brown \"had just come downstairs.\" The same problem in a slightly different form occurs in the next sentence: \"they both seen the same thing.\" Had seen is, of course, the correct phrase. Next, a nearly ubiquitous problem, the confusion be- tween imply and infer. To imply is \"to signify, mean or suggest.\" On the other hand, to infer is \"to derive by rea- soning, to conclude or to judge from evidence.\" The cor- rect usage is this: \"Mr. Smith was not trying to imply that there weren't other witnesses...\" Infer is absolutely wrong in this context. To understand these two words, this sentence may help: \"From the way the UFO flew, the witness inferred it was under intelligent control, but by his sarcasm, the skeptic implied the witness was ly- ing.\" Another common error: \"...other people would of had to...\" This mistake really comes from a mis-writing of common speech forms; we mean to say \"other people would have had to,\" but when we talk, we often contract. Would have becomes would've which then gets written phonetically as would of. Take note. [n the next paragraph, though 1 do not want to stress this kind of error, I slipped in just one common mis- spelling. Truely should, of course, be truly, and in this first sentence phenomena as a singular noun makes its second incorrect appearance. The next common error oc- curs in the phrase \"they are as amazed as me.\" The proper pronoun is / — \"as amazed as /.\" When in doubt, continue in your mind the unspoken remainder of the sentence, which in this case goes like this: \"They are as amazed as I am amazed.\" If you've incorrectly used the pronoun me, our example would sound like this: \"They are as amazed as me am amazed.\" Your ear will tell you the truth in these situations. T he last sentence in our dreadful UFO sighting report contains a vast and depressing collection of errors, a cacophonous coda of confusion. First we have a major lack of parallelism. The conjunctions neither-nor must be followed by parallel parts of speech. But here, the two forms are grossly out of sync: \"Neither the appear- ance\" is followed by \"nor when it speeded off.\" Appearance is a noun and when it speeded off is a clause incorrectly substituting for the required parallel noun. (On top of this error, there is yet another — the verb should be sped off.) One can undo the damage by pairing \"the appearance (of the craft)\" with \"the way (it sped off).\" or something similar, but as it is, the wording is a disaster. Again, let your ear tell you the truth. If you say \"neither the appearance,\" then follow it in your mind with this: \"nor the...( whatever noun you wish).\" I've added one last awkwardness to the injuries I've previously inflicted, in the phrase well-lighted-up object. Well-lit object is not only more graceful, but it saves space, too. Economy counts. A few final suggestions. When you write an article or a report or prepare a lecture, read the manuscript aloud and have someone else go over it for you — preferably someone who reads a great deal and is not afraid to suggest improvements. I edit myself by reading over what I've written, paragraph by paragraph again and again. Then I read it aloud to myself, quietly and behind closed doors, of course, lest friends and neighbors think eccentricity has become my permanent state. Then I have a trusted friend, with experience in editing, care- fully check it once more. Nothing comes easy in life, least of all smoothly flowing, accurate and graceful prose. We all make em- barrassing mistakes. But in the context of UFO research, we must also realize that, one way or another, we're in the public eye. The last thing we need is a gaggle of CSICOPPERs chortling over our writing mistakes, re- joicing in the false perception that these errors give them license to bury the UFO phenomenon beneath their snobbish contempt. Let's not give them that chance. Let's write (and speak) as well as we possibly can.

Do's and Don 't's. By Stanton T. Friedman B ased upon the enormous amount of research done in connection with the recovery of crashed flying saucers in New Mexico, it appears at least possible that pieces of wreckage may come into the hands of UFO researchers. Rumors have persisted that at least some of the hundreds of GI's who were involved in the recovery operations may have picked up souvenirs. For example, dentist John Kromschroeder was handed a piece of very strange material in the late 1970s by Pilot Pappy Henderson. As life winds down for those in- volved in these 1947 events, one might indeed be faced with the problem of evaluating a piece of such wreck- age. The question is how to go about it. ASSUMPTIONS One of the silliest suggestions is that a piece of wreckage from an ET spacecraft would have to be made from el- ements not known on earth. One merely tests for all known elements (not such an easy task). If none show up, then the specimen is of ET origin. It is implied that if the specimen contains elements known on Earth, it is not of ET origin. What is crazy here is that such a sug- gestion has actually been made by astronomer Carl Sagan. Yet, it is the astronomers who have been telling us for decades that their spectroscopic and other mea- surements of light radio waves, paniculate radiation, etc. coming to Earth from the distant and near solar system environment, reveal only the elements and com- pounds we already know. We are assured that physics and chemistry are the same out there as here, so Sagan's suggestion is absurd. WHAT TO LOOK FOR? I think it is reasonable to look for physical, electrical, thermal and mechanical properties that are of impor- tance in the construction of specialized equipment able to perform functions that we cannot duplicate, even though made of elements we know. Composition of the material is important, but won't answer most questions. Obvious properties to determine are melting point, density, hardness and grain structure, along with tensile and creep strengths, thermal and electrical conductivity and magnetic susceptibility, both as a function of tem- perature and in different directions within the sample. It is very important to note that many of today's materials have properties that could not even have been determined 100 years ago, including radioactivi- ty, superconductivity and fissionability. We could not have measured isotope ratios, parts per billion of vari- ous dopants or contaminants, or properties at a few degrees above absolute zero. Development of better superconductors over the past 35 years gives us some clues. The phenomenon of su- perconductivity was discovered in 1911. There were limits in terms of critical temperatures and critical mag- netic fields that greatly limited the utilization of the very special characteristic of zero resistance to the flow of an electrical current. One breakthrough occurred in the early 1960s which substantially raised the temperature, still very cold, to which certain hard superconductors would remain su- perconducting and enormously increased critical fields. A few years back, whole new families of oxide super- conductors were discovered. These had critical temper- atures so high that liquid nitrogen could be used making the cost of construction far easier and cheaper than if liq- uid helium were still required. The peak temperature stayed near the same value for several years, and yet once again a breakthrough has recently been made and the temperature is moving up again. In all cases the el- ements of which the superconductors were made were ones native to Earth. It is the recipe that matters. Theory has, in general, lagged behind experiment. There is also a long way from lab testing of a small piece of exciting new material to the manufacture of miles of wire at a reasonable cost and with no defects. O ne must reasonably expect that different pieces of a flying saucer perform different functions. Microintegrated circuits and turbine blades do very dif- ferent things and operate at very different temperatures. One key factor in the design of any airborne system, no less spaceborne, is weight. Thus, often the design crite- ria is not cost or efficiency, but rather computing power per unit weight, or energy production per unit weight. 1 was made particularly conscious of this with regard to the development of space nuclear power systems. Pounds per kilowatt, not efficiency was the concern. One reason is that excess heat normally must be even- tually radiated to space. The amount of heat radiated per unit area goes as the 4th power of the temperature. Thus, doubling the temperature of the radiating surface decreases the required area (and weight) by a factor of 16. An important concern is whether the piece of wreckage is from a structure or from a specialized electronic or other component whose function we might not even know. Fiber optics and windows are both made of glass.

Fiber optics and windows are both made of glass. It should also be stressed that any study of the development of technology shows that technological progress almost invariably comes from doing things differently in an unpredictable way. A nuclear reactor is not just a better furnace. A laser is not just a better light bulb. A microintegrated circuit is not just a better vacuum tube. This concept is very important because there is a strong tendency to claim that certain objec- tives are impossible, when what is actually meant is this particular method of accomplishing a particular objective doesn't work. It may be impossible to go faster than the speed of sound with a propeller-driven airplane. Trips to the moon with single stage rockets constructed similarly to the very heavy German V-2 rockets would not have been feasible. Limiting the acceleration of a moon rocket to 1 G would rule out such a mission with our rockets. I t is also very important to realize that the mode of preparation of material can have an enormous impact on its properties. Boiled steak and broiled peas might well turn off restaurant patrons. Recent work, for example, suggests that the properties of certain steels can be substantially improved if they are pre- pared in a high electric field which seems to orient the grain structure in new ways. Nitrogen ions can be accelerated into the surface of a material to greatly increase hardness. This gives very different results than adding nitrogen to the material when it is being smelted or rolled or drawn. What characteristics would be particularly important for a piece of the outer skin of a saucer? One would think that surface hardness, high strength to weight ra- tios, and resistance to oxidation, corrosion and heating would be of particular importance. Electrical properties (such as conductivity as a function of temperature) might also be important if the vehicle used some sort of external electromagnetic propulsion system and/or wanted to control its radar profile. WHO TESTS AND HOW? Suppose one has a small piece of material ostensibly recovered at the Corona site, and wants to test these properties. Where should one go? Before selecting a testing laboratory, I believe that certain criteria must be met. • The lab should be a certified or licensed lab for the tests that are to be done. • It must have performed those tests often and on many different materials so that direct comparisons with \"con- ventional\" materials are feasible. • The lab must be willing to sign off on test results with a full description of the techniques and equipment used, the standards employed, reproducibility and ac- curacy, and so on. • The lab must be willing to maintain a no-release pol- icy on whatever test results are made. • In advance of testing there must be detailed discus- sions of destructive and non-destructive tests and what techniques will be used, if necessary, to subdivide the samples. Obviously a destructive test requiring the use of the entire available sample would be foolish. • A protocol should be worked out in advance as to the sequence of testing. Thus a sample may be used for several non-destructive tests, hardness, density, etc., before being used for a destructive test. Certain test results may suggest a different sequence and new tests. I t should be obvious from the above comments that samples should be examined and tested by licensed commercial laboratories under the direction of very ex- perienced materials specialists. Having a professor have a graduate student check things out would seem to vio- late all the rules, especially if they say, as has been the case in the past. \"Oh, of course you can't use my name.\" Test results without full information are, frankly, al- most worthless. Also it seems necessary that assurance be provided all along the way that no test samples can be clandestinely removed, replaced, withheld or substituted for. Perhaps this means keeping a videotape record of what is hap- pening. It should be noted that fissionable materials such as U-235 and plutonium are considered accountable mate- rials. Custodians must know how much of each is lo- cated where at all times. Standard specialized procedures are used by the International Atomic Energy Agency, for example, to prevent diversion of these valuable materi- als to clandestine nuclear weapon programs. Agreement must, of course, be reached prior to test- ing on the intellectual property rights. Who can publish the data? Will there be any release prior to publication in a technical journal such as Science or Nature which re- quire peer review? The cold fusion fiasco demonstrated the need for peer review prior to publication as opposed to publication via press release. Perhaps the most important step to be taken before testing begins is to have a detailed discussion with the Continued on Page 14 DECEMBER 1993 NUMBER 308 PAGE 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL W e spoke in this space last time about the current status of ufology—in some ways now more popular than ever— and the implications, good and bad, of same for the future of UFO studies. We spoke about the need to find allies out there in the world at large, particularly within the scientific community, and cited the case of Steven Aftergood, chair of the section on Government and Secrecy for the American Federation of Scientists. What we didn't address was how such alliances might be forged and maintained, if not actually nurtured, to our own mutual benefit. THE LONG DISTANCE RUNNER: PART II B efore continuing, let me explain why I didn't give out Aftergood's address in the last issue. For one thing, I didn't want the poor man suddenly besieged with letters from true believers uttering, in effect, now that we're on the same page about the government cover-up of UFOs, what are we going to do about the millions of Americans being abducted every year, the underground bases harboring captured flying saucers, and the secret treaty between our own government and aliens-from-wherever which permits such abductions to continue? You know all the rumors. The fact of the matter, of course, is that we aren't on the same page with most members of the Federation of American Scientists, at least as far as UFOs are con- cerned. That doesn't mean we don't share similar con- cerns or that we shouldn't support one another when and where possible. The same is true of most of our con- gressional representatives, along with many members of the media and the military. But as long as we regard everyone in science, journalism and government as our intransigent enemies by definition, the more we isolate ourselves and our subject of study from the mainstream of American thought, save as a topic for the more sen- sational tabloids. Unfortunately, with the approach of the Western Millennium, the \"tabloidizing\" of the UFO phenomenon is only going to get worse. Increasing apocalyptic and end-of-an-age thinking can only result in a growing cli- mate of increased expectations, a demand for heavenly \"revelations\" that can't possibly—or simply won't — be fulfilled, if past UFO \"behavior\" is any indication. Indeed, while ufology is likely to \"profit\" in the short run from its inevitable association with New Age mil- lennial aspirations, it's just as likely to suffer in the long run. Why should anyone in government, the American Federation of Scientists or NASA bend over backwards to ally themselves with the scientific study of UFOs if the latter is publicly perceived, by and large, as merely another New Age cult, high on impending de- liverance from above, whose main form of afterhours entertainment is listening to channeled knowledge re- ceived from ethereal extraterrestrial entities? Of course they want to maintain their distance, if for no other rea- son than to retain their own credibility. Again, the question is how do we forge a wider al- liance with the American public at large? How do we get ourselves taken seriously by government, the media and science? The answer is simple, although not obvi- ous, because it flies in the face of common sense. One way to get ourselves taken more seriously may be to avoid the subject of UFOs altogether. Those members of the American Federation of Scientists who support the panel against government secrecy, for instance, are engaged in a crusade against bureaucratic secrecy on principle, not because they be- lieve their government is necessarily hiding the truth about extraterrestrial spaceships. Those members of the media who run up against a stonewall in their pursuit of classified documents don't feel themselves threatened by imminent abduction by a UFO—they feel threatened because they're routinely denied access to information of several stripes. Similarly, many members of Congress feel thwarted and outraged not because the government lies about its knowledge of UFOs, but because it lies to them, period. Inasmuch as we can support these other \"disaffected\" segments of society we should, even if it means biting our own tongues. Ask your congressman: \"Forget about UFOs, what happened at Roswell? If it was a 45-year- old secret project that crashed, just tell us.\" Now what about Groom Lake and Area 51? \"Forget the rumors of retrieved flying saucers, what's going on? With the Cold War over, why does the Air Force need to seize an- other 3900 acres of public land adjoining the Nellis AFB Test Range?\" What about the Paul Bennewitz Affair? \"Forget the rumors of UFOs, why was the Air Force Office of Special Intelligence passing apparent doctored documents to a citizen of the United States in the first place, presumably resulting in the latter's virtual nervous breakdown?\" All sorts of issues relevant and common to science, the media and the day-to-day operations of the political body can be raised and supported by the UFO commu- nity without ever once resorting to the subject of UFOs, or without demanding that the answers from our public officials necessarily address the UFO question head- to-head.

By W. L. Garner, Jr. I n the last couple of years, MUFON meetings, publi- cations, and conversations at all levels have seen an escalating tempo of controversy between the \"pseudo scientists\" on one hand and the ''new age psychics\" on the other. Like a festering wound, the controversy is beginning to affect MUFON's effectiveness and repu- tation. Unfortunately, many of the noisy antagonists on both sides are venting their emotional wants and have lit- tle or no concern for MUFON's stated purpose or the scientific method. MUFON purports to be an international scientific organization that believes a concentrated scientific study by dedicated investigators and researchers will provide the ultimate answer to the UFO enigma. A scientific or- ganization dedicated to scientific study must establish and must demand adherence to protocols for its investi- gators and researchers, or its reports and conclusions simply become more meaningless babble. Personal be- liefs are threatened only to the extent each individual chooses to expose his beliefs to the available scientific evidence. The scientific protocols for the MUFON Field Investigator (Fl) are well established in the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual, the essence of which is laid out in Chapter II, \"The Field Investigator's Code of Ethics.\" Properly documenting the evidence is an es- sential scientific first step. Simply stated, the FI's pri- mary responsibility is to identify and document the ev- idence as objectively as possible without causing any harm to the percipient or others. It is not to publicize the incident or to pass final judgment on the evidence or the percipient. Thus, every effort should be made to record a percipient's experience exactly as that person experi- enced it. In practice, the FI first must make a decision as to whether there is the potential for acquiring enough factual evidence to justify the time and expense he/she will spend acquiring and documenting it. If he/she de- cides to proceed, there are provisions in the protocol that provide the investigator an opportunity to question or ex- press doubt about any part or all of the evidence re- ported, but he/she must not ignore or change any part of that evidence. Protocols for scientific researchers in the various dis- ciplines are much more complex and demanding, and usually require extensive training in each particular dis- cipline. Protocols for the scientific method began in mathematics with rules for logic, stemming from the protocol that all propositions which are not themselves self-evident must be derived from others that are self-ev- ident. From this simple beginning with clear-cut an- swers, protocols have become far more complex, en- compassing, and difficult as the scientific method has been applied to more and more areas of nature and life. UFOs, extraterrestrial aliens, abductions, telepathy, out-of-body experiences, etc., are all valid areas for sci- entific investigation, but scientific investigation de- mands the protocols of specific research objectives, techniques, and proofs. One or more individuals es- pousing grandiose revelations may sound authentic and compelling, but without scientific validation it is useless gossip. One major hurdle in investigating these types of claims is the necessity for independent confirmation (feedback); without it nothing is scientifically estab- lished. Another is the patience and self-discipline to avoid jumping to conclusions until enough scientific evidence is in to be able to draw valid conclusions. T he human mind is still the greatest mystery, capable of creating or wiping out memories, biomedical conditions and even whole personalities. These changes can result from a wide variety of traumas, and some- times from just wishes, desires or needs. Interactions with entities or extraterrestrial aliens may or may not be one of the causes. Those of you who have suffered through the terminal illness of a loved one, or who have worked with the results of childhood trauma, may have witnessed some of these psychological manifestations. Science is just beginning to scratch the surface in trying to understand the reality behind all of this. For MUFON to be a viable scientific organization there must be continuous, aggressive efforts at all levels to keep all activities directed toward scientific objectives. At the level where activities are directed primarily to- wards the investigation of alleged UFO incidents, that mandate is comparatively simple to pursue. The proto- cols for that are laid out in the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual. At any level where activities are more involved with public relations, meetings, and pub- lications, that mandate is infinitely more difficult. Keeping discussions, meetings, and publications aimed towards improving scientific skills and understanding is much harder, particularly if you also want to keep it at- tractive for a wide variety of members. The conflict between MUFON's stated objectives and the New Age proponents' practices are most obvi- ous at meetings. Personal, even if sincere, tales of oth- erworldly experiences presented as unquestionable, fac- tual events may improve attendance, but they add little or nothing to anyone's scientific understanding of what- ever may be going on, or to the skills needed to investi- DECEMBER 1993 NUMBER 308 PAGE 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL One or more Individuals espousing grandiose revelations may sound authentic and com- pelling, but without scientific validation It Is useless gossip. gate such claims. It is not even an acceptable method of documenting these incidents. At its best, it risks psy- chological damage to fragile personalities, both speakers and attendees, for the sake of attendance. At its worst, by definition it turns your organization into a cult. The director who plans your meetings and issues your publications has a narrow and difficult path to fol- low. The difference between presenting a controversial experience as part of a training program to improve in- vestigators' skills versus presenting it as entertainment or recruitment may be difficult for some to fathom; but, when scientific objectives and standards are sacrificed for entertainment by unverified propaganda, your group has already begun the transformation from a scientific organization into a cult.

The problem is an interdisciplinary one, requiring a great deal of experience so that one doesn't, for example, test dirt spectroscopically instead of using agricultural test procedures. One must also note that the intelligence and mili- tary agencies of the U. S. government have clearly demonstrated their very strong desire to cover up sub- stantive material about flying saucers. Therefore, it is to be expected that they would try to obtain any sam- ples, to prevent publication of test results, and perhaps to intimidate those who possess the sample and those doing the testing. Our security must be excellent. In addition, considerable care must be taken as to how the news of any truly exciting test results should be broken. The implications of proof of ET Visitor reality are significant and numerous. Nuclear physicist Friedman lives in New Brunswick, Canada, when he isn't on the UFO lecture circuit.

The Fund for UFO Research an- nounces that Raymond Fowler has received the organi- zation's Isabel L. Davis Memorial Award for 1993. With the award comes a check in the amount of $1,000. Fowler is a veteran UFO investigator and author of six books on the UFO subject. \"The 1993 publication of Ray Fowler's The Allagash Abductions, an important and carefully documented case, caps a productive career of over 30 years,\" said Fund Chairman Richard Hall. \"Fowler has set investigation standards, first for NICAP, and later for MUFON. His six UFO books in- clude three on The Andreasson Affair, culminating with The Watchers (1990). His work has greatly enhanced our knowledge and understanding of UFOs.\" The Isabel L. Davis Memorial Award was estab- lished in 1986 \"to recognize long-term accomplish- ments and excellence in promoting rational inquiry into reported UFO sightings and related phenomena.\" Isabel Davis was a pioneer in the field of Ufology. She was a co-founder of Civilian Saucer Investigation of New York and a frequent contributor to the organiza- tion's high-quality newsletter. She is perhaps best known for her outstanding in- vestigation and report, co-authored by Ted Bloecher, on the famous Kelly-Hopkinsville (KY) entity case, which was published by the Center for UFO Studies. She was also a valued staff member of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena. In 1979, she was one of the founders of the Fund for UFO Research. Ms. Davis passed away in 1984. Nominations for the 1993 Isabel Davis Award were made by the Executive Committee of the Fund for UFO Research. The recipient was chosen by the Fund's sup- porters.

For an otherworldly be- ing to always be able to predict how any human being is going to react emotionally or choose to cope is highly unlikely. Research into UFO abductions has indicated that there are frequent reports of \"tests\" or \"staged events\" to elicit emotional responses from abductees. When these abduction participants react, there is fre- quently a subtle acknowledgement that the subjects did well by just responding with intense emotions. This implies that they have not understood our human emo- tions well and have undertaken a study of this unex- pected or less known variable—as any sensible scientist would—if indeed this is the assumed logic of their ac- tions. There are many abduction accounts in which the little grays have reacted with apparent surprise at sudden emotional displays made by captive humans. The crea- tures tend to \"stand back\" or simply leave at such mo- ments; they do not challenge the feelings. It therefore seems unlikely that they could be superior in the emo- tional assessment of humans prior to an abduction. As researchers and mental health professionals we have constantly stressed our assessments of sanity and normality among abductees to establish credibility for the phenomenon. However, how many experiencers have not coped well and lapsed into dysfunctional cop- ing behavior such as alcoholism, drug abuse, delin- quency, overeating, gambling, or explosive and detri- mental displacement of anger? How many have buried their confusion, anxiety, anger, and fear in these ways for years without knowing the source of their irritations? How many personalities have been shaped by years of silent intrusions upon the mind and emotions of these humans? Will these unfortunate people be judged as having less credible encounters because they are alcoholics or poorly coping individuals? We cannot judge the nature of their original incidents by simply assessing their pre- sent level of functioning. Researching the encounters may be next to impossible due to dysfunctional behav- ior and fragility in coping ability. But we should not con- clude that their encounters are created by their present- day coping deficiencies. Skeptics will claim that the alcoholism, for example, manufactured the anomalous event. In fact, the opposite is more believable—that the bizarre experience led the witness to drinking exces- sively as a dysfunctional method of coping. Nor should we conclude—without a careful investigation of the facts—that their experiences are imagined or self-serv- ing. We would be naive to assume that all abductees will cope well, given time—and that all would even make the revealing connection to UFO's in order to begin appro- priately processing their unresolved feelings, phobias, and non-productive behaviors. MYTH #2: \"Abductees that cannot withstand public scrutiny are less credible.\" The second line of trouble is the public ridicule, de- bunking, and disbelief that overwhelms the experiencer who may be barely managing their emotions under such pressure. We have seen some publicized cases break down certain witnesses into psychotic episodes, erratic behavior or claims, and depression with withdrawal into seclusion. The skeptics gleefully make their claims of \"hoax\" or \"insanity\" as these witnesses crumble un- der the intense weight of public scrutiny. Can we even begin to know how that pressure would feel? Are we to conclude that their encounters are not real just because they fail to survive these kinds of pressures? The public typically makes an instantaneous assessment based on a media critique or brief witness interview (shaped by editing, of course). Those words and images are un- likely to represent the individual's entire experience and full range of emotions, but, like a timely snapshot, this is what will be recalled. MYTH #3: \"All Abductees who speak on TV, at conferences, or sell books have not suffered badly and just like attention.\" On the other end of this discussion are those experi- encers who are seen and assessed by the public—even the UFO community—as \"coping too well to have been genuine abductees.\" Judged as attention-seekers, book peddlers, or New Age \"crusaders,\" these individuals are often only seen and known to the public in the latter stages of their years of coping. Coping is a process. Many of these same abductees struggled for years, pri- vately, trying desperately to comprehend the confusion, mixed feelings, and anguish of having their perception of reality shattered forever. Documenting their experiences and personal growth in book form has become a thera- peutic catharsis—a way of organizing, releasing, and gaining some form of control over their feelings, while hopefully helping someone else out there with their pri- vate disclosures.

Phoenix, AZ, $29.90 Reviewed by Dennis Stacy T hat commercial computer software developers have finally discovered UFOs is not so surprising: that it took them so long is. Actually, a DOS \"digital book\" - UFO Research in Australia and New Zealand — ap- peared down under last year, although it left a lot to be desired. Essentially, UFO Research was little more than one long scrolling text file; it lacked onscreen graphics and had only rudimentary search capabilities, and of course was limited to southern hemisphere cases. UFO For Windows takes full advantage of the Windows GUI, or Graphical User Interface, a Macintosh-like shell that sits atop the antiquated DOS command line structure. To run UFO you'll need an IBM PC or compatible, Windows 3.1 and at least 2MB of Ram. The program ships on four 3.5-inch diskettes. A CD-ROM version with video clips (and presumably sound) is also being advertised at the same price, but was unavailable at the time of review. Two products are actually involved here, one being the program itself, and the other of course being the program's content, that is, the UFO information being disseminated to the general public. It gets better marks on the former than the latter, although the material pre- sented isn't nearly as outright sensational as it might be, considering that the two primary sources for same ap- pear to be Jim Dilettoso and Lt. Col. Wendelle Stevens, who is described on the back of the package as being with \"United States Air Force Technical Intelligence.\" On the other hand, it's not as good and reliable as it could be, either. I suspect that Stevens supplied most of the pictures from his immense photo collection, includ- ing, as one might expect, several of Billy Meier's UFOs, and that someone else (Dilettoso?) did the final writing. Both crop circles and animal mutilations are simply subsumed to be part and parcel of the UFO phenome- non; in fact, crop circles account for almost all of the cases covered since 1980, which is a definite disap- pointment. What happened to the Cash-Landrum, Hudson River Valley and Belgium UFO cases? For that matter, what happened to a general introduction to the UFO phenomenon in general? On the other hand, the program itself is a real charmer. After installation it opens with four windows or individual screens showing, a finder map in the upper left-hand corner opposite a case description, below which is a longer section of accompanying text, to the left of which is an associated graphic in the great ma- jority of cases. Some 500 cases are covered in varying degrees of detail. Searching for a particular case is a snap and can be done in several ways. Cases can be menu-listed by topic or date and then selected, or they can be opened simply by clicking on one of the dots on the map. If the map seems too small you can enlarge it to a full screen and then zoom in on even smaller sections for additional control and choice. Images can be enlarged to an entire screen, too, but they're of such low resolution to begin with that it's hardly worth the exercise. Graphics and text can both be pasted to the Windows clipboard for im- port into other programs. Bravo, Windows! It may not be the ground-level-up GUI that the Macintosh operat- ing system is, but it's a wonder that it runs on top of DOS in any form at all, let alone as miraculously as it does. In the final analysis, UFO for Windows is a better ad- vertisement for what can be done with computers than for what can be learned about UFOs. It is, however, an interesting, if flawed first approach, and some of you will wish to check it out, just to see how it can be done.

(A puzzled Sigmund Freud is on the cover.) Subtitled \"Repressed- memory therapy is harming patients, devastating fami- lies and intensifying a backlash against mental-health practitioners,\" the article is written by Leon Jaroff. Jaroff is a CSICOP fellow-traveller, Randi apologist, and, if memory serves, the former editor of another Time-Life publication, the science magazine Discover, which I mention only for your infotainment benefit. PAGE 16 NUMBER 308 DECEMBER 1993"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Those who claim to have been ritually abused by satanic cults also tell of'missing fetuses\" and buried bodies, but the courts and law enforce- ment officials keep asking a simple question: \"Where are the skeletons?\" The article itself is straight forward reporting, and there is even a box by another reporter on the abduction phenomenon, \"It Came From Outer Space,\" on page 56, which quotes both Hopkins and Jacobs. It's not quite as detailed a treatment of False Memory Syndrome as two earlier articles which appeared in Vanity Fair and The New Yorker, but it gets the job done, so to speak. The main thing to remember, and the main point of in- terest for ufologists. is that proponents lump abductions into the FMS stew along with many accounts of child- hood sexual abuse and ritual satanic cult abuse. I am one of those who happens to think that there are phenomenological parallels between all three types of re- ports, not only in the context of the content of the ac- counts themselves, but in how such accounts are rou- tinely investigated. As far as abductions are concerned. I personally would like to see a lot less emphasis on re- gressive hypnosis, and a great deal more emphasis on in- dependent, physical verification, but mine is probably a minority opinion among the UFO community at large. Whether you agree or not, the current debate over the False Memory Syndrome is indeed the hottest topic of the day among therapists and other mental-health pro- fessionals in general, and will profoundly affect how the public at large perceives the abduction phenomenon. As a sort of third party to the debate, it would behoove ufologists to bone up on the basics of the argument, and the Time article (along with the proceeding one on Freud and psychoanalysis) is as good a place to begin as any. At issue is the nature of memory itself, the human re- sponse to trauma, and the question of whether or not re- peated unpleasant childhood experiences can be suc- cessfully repressed, only to erupt later in life (and if so, howl). The psychiatric community seems to be di- viding into two hostile camps over these and related issues. As much as \"abductionology\" might prefer to be left out of the fray, that now seems unlikely if not patently impossible. Like it or not, we are reduced to the position of having to prove the physical existence of \"Satan,\" or, at the very least, hordes of invading ex- traterrestrial demons, if we expect to be taken seriously. It's not an envious situation, obviously. And it's cer- tainly not a case that can be proved by anecdotal ac- counts, the sole confirmation of which is typically hyp- notically retrieved, however many of same we amass. Those who claim to have been ritually abused by satanic cults also tell of \"missing fetuses\" and buried bodies, but the courts and law enforcement officials keep asking a simple question: \"Where are the skeletons?\" Regardless of how one feels about the subject, the warnings to be derived from the False Memory Syndrome debate are abundantly clear and loud. Without a bona fide bag of bones, some practicing abduction therapists are inevitably scheduled for an unwanted ap- pearance in court, as sure as the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. In fact, it's already happened to one west coast therapist who probably now wishes there really was a skeleton in his closet. 1993 Keyhoe Journalism Award Fund for UFO Research The Fund for UFO Research, a nonprofit scientific or- ganization based in Washington, D.C., announces cash awards for the best articles or stories published or broad- cast in 1993 concerning the subject of Unidentified Flying Objects. The award was established in 1989 to honor the memory of Major Donald E. Keyhoe, a retired Marine Corps pilot and former director of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena. Maj. Keyhoe was an aide to Charles A. Lindbergh after the aviator made the first solo, non-stop flight from New York to Paris in 1927. During the 1930s, Keyhoe was a freelance writer whose work appeared in such publica- tions as The Nation, The Saturday Evening Post and Readers Digest. He passed away on November 29, 1988. The recipients of the 1992 Donald E. Keyhoe Journalism Award were: • Christopher Evans of the Cleveland, OH, Plain Dealer, for an article describing a U.S. Coast Guard investiga- tion into the March 4, 1988, landing of an unidentified flying object; • Annette Gillespie of the Bradenton, FL, Herald, who wrote about the UFO abduction phenomenon; and • Dawn Shurmaitis, a reporter for The Times Leader of Wilkes-Barre, PA, for a detailed examination of UFO activity and interest in the subject throughout the state. The three winners shared a cash award of $850.

UFO ABDUCTIONS IN GULF BREEZE By Ed and Frances Walters An Avon Paperback Book Scheduled for release in mid-December 1993 S ince the publishing of The Gulf Breeze Sightings and the resulting publicity, I have received thou- sands of letters from all over the world. Most are from UFO witnesses who send me reports and photographs of what they saw. This has been a truly amazing and hum- bling experience. Are all the UFO photographs actually true UFOs? I don't know but many of the daytime shots show struc- tural details and interaction with the surrounding area such as shadows, illumination on clouds, etc. Four years ago as the onslaught of letters began, I noted that many people had questions about my hypno- sis sessions with Dr. Dan Overlade. What had I dis- covered? Plus, almost everybody wanted to know if there had been further UFO sightings since my last en- counter, May 1, 1988, as described in the book. This was reason number one for Frances and me to write our fol- low-up book, UFO Abductions In Gulf Breeze. At first I rejected any more of the public spotlight and refused to write a follow-up book. Being fair game as a public figure was a shocking experience. Some of the lies uttered by debunkers were truly extraordinary. They sent out fake UFO photographs, planted a UFO model, and attacked my character without conscience. But as time passed, the fake photograph debunking plot was ex- posed by none other than Jim Moseley. The UFO model was examined and conclusively proven by witnesses, Mr. & Mrs L. Thomas, to have been built almost two years after I took photographs of the real UFO. I passed four lie detector tests with three different ex- aminers, but even so, the debunkers to this day pro- mote their rumors and lies. And that is the second reason we decided to release the new book. What is the book about? It presents an exact transcript of the hypnosis sessions as videotaped by Dr. Overlade, along with several chapters written by the now deceased Dr. Overlade to whom I dedicated the book. The second half of the book concentrates on scores of UFO sightings documented by a local research team and witnessed by hundreds of people at a time. Is this the last word on Gulf Breeze? Certainly not; the debunkers have already gathered their forces to at- tack the ongoing UFO sightings as being emergency flares, and of course, a massive hoax. But unfortunately for the debunkers, the Gulf Breeze UFO sightings con- tinue with some amazing day time and night time video- taped encounters. Daily my mail box is filled with letters from wit- nesses which I try to answer. My sincere thanks to all of you for your continued support. — Ed Walters MORE GOOD WRITING HINTS Don't use no double negatives. About them sentence fragments. Try to not ever split infinitives.

First, Carpenter says that Keith Basterfield created the term Fantasy-Prone Personality (FPP). In the paper \"UFO Abductees and Contactees: Psychopathology or Fantasy Proneness\" (Professional Psychology 1991: 22(3). 215-22), Basterfield and his co-authors clearly cite S.C. Wilson and T.X. Barber as originally describing FPP. They also identify preliminary research by J.R. Hilgard as contributing to the concept, and work by S. Myers and H. Austrin, and S.J. Lynn and S.W. Rhue, as supporting Wilson and Barber's original findings. Second, Mr. Carpenter states \"[FPP] is only discussed in UFO-related articles and research.\" In fact, a quick scan of my files (as well as the references from the Basterfield article above) shows there are numerous pa- pers on FPP in the mental health literature, including journals such as British Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis, and American Psychologist. Of all the citations I have come across, only the Basterfield article deals primarily (if at all) with UFO abductees and contactees. Third, FPP does not appear in \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manuals of Disorders\" because it is not a disorder, but a psychological construct, thought to be re- lated to those of \"imaginative involvement\" and \"ab- sorption.\" 1 agree with Mr. Carpenter that the FPP construct by itself is insufficient to explain away every abduction case. However, FPP is neither discredited, nor dead, nor buried, as Mr. Carpenter asserts. If we want other professionals to stop reflexively taking a dismissive or reductionist approach to the abduction phenomenon we should resist the temptation to do the same with the work of others, at least without first seriously studying the body of work we are addressing. — David Gotlib, M.D. Toronto, Ontario (Dr. Gotlib is the editor of BAE, the Bulletin of Anomalous Experience, 2 St. Clair Avenue West, Suite 607, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M4V 1L5.

Saturn (magnitude 0.9), in Aquarius, is low in the SW at dusk, setting in the W shortly after 7 PM in midmonth. The lu- nar crescent lies above the ringed planet on the 14th. Toward the end of January, tiny elusive Mercury approaches to within 1-1/2° of Saturn (on the 31st). Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Jupiter (-1.9), in Libra, rises in the E about 1:30 AM in mid- January. The gas giant swings around to the S at dawn. The crescent Moon is below Jupiter on the 6th. Moon Phases: Last quarter — January 4 New moon — January 1 1 First quarter — January 1 9 Full moon — January 27 C O The Stars: During the midevening the wondrously bright constellation of Orion the Hunter confronts the Bull Taurus in the S. the V- shaped Hyades outlining the angry animal's face. In the bull's shoulder the little dipper-shaped Pleiades cluster denotes a spear wound inflicted by Orion. The Pleiades, Hyades, and beautiful Orion Nebula in the hunter's sword all merit the ob- server's attention at this season. The delicate Pleiades is a relatively young star cluster, having condensed from a gaseous nebula less than 100 million years ago. Although several hundred stars actually comprise the group, only 6 can be seen normally with the naked eye. (One Arizona observer claims that he spotted 20 without optical aid in the clear desert air!) Binoculars reveal 30 to 50 stars in the cluster. Increasing magnification adds more and more to the total. The Hyades constitutes a moving cluster of older (800 million years) stars. This group drifts eastward through space and eventually will converge toward a point east of Orion's red star Betelgeuse. Aldebaran, the right eye of the bull, is not a member of the cluster. The orange star is more than twice as close to us than the Hyades and merely lies in front of the cluster from our viewpoint. The middle \"fuzzy star\" in Orion's sword (located below his trio of belt stars) is actually the spectacular Orion Nebula. Marvelous to behold in binoculars or a telescope, the object glows from the impact of intense ultraviolet radiation emitted from a tiny star cluster in the center of the cloud. Four of these hot young (8 million years) stars are easily visible in a small telescope, forming a trapezoid-shaped pattern called the Trapezium.

ALASKA HAS FIRST STATE MEETING Norman Mark, Alaska State Director, arranged for Alaska's first state meeting and their first newsletter by meeting at the Anchorage Hilton Hotel on October 3, 1993. In attendance were Birch Pavelsky, Assistant State Director, and new State Section Directors Glen Harper and Rose Eckhoff. There were three major phases to the meeting: (1) An exposure to each mem- ber's interest in and introduction into MUFON; (2) A discussion of the goals and expectations for MUFON International, MUFON Alaska, and each member indi- vidually; and (3) Discussion of ways to interface with the community at large, given the existence of consid- eration popular cynicism on the subject of UFOs. These people are to be commended for literally breaking the ice (and snow) by traveling to Anchorage in a state that has twice the geographical area of Texas. MUFON WEST VIRGINIA The University of West Virginia not only has a top ranked football team this year, but is a state that is growing in membership under the tutelage of Dr. Ted Spickler, State Director. Dr. Spickler attended his first MUFON UFO Symposium in Akron, Ohio, in 1974, where he was favorably impressed with the organization. Issue number 1 of their \"Very Occasional Newsletter for Members of the Mutual UFO Network in West Virginia\" was mailed during the Fall of 1993, edited by Ted Spickler. Gregg Knight (Wallace, WV) is the Assistant State Director.

SEASON'S GREETINGS The front cover of the Journal represents a personal Christmas card to all of our members throughout the world from the MUFON UFO Journal staff and the MUFON Board of Directors. We want to wish each and everyone a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

We want to express our thanks and gratitude to our members for making MUFON the world's largest UFO inves- tigative organization. We look forward to many more fruitful years together as we accept the challenge to re- solve the greatest mystery of the space age—the UFO phenomena. We are indebted to Wesley S. Crum for the cover artwork. NEW WESTERN MUFON AMATEUR NET Several amateur radio operators in the western region of states have expressed an interest in organizing a MU- FON net to cover Mountain and Pacific time zones. The subject was revitalized during Walt's November 14th participation in the \"Area 2000\" radio talk show on Las Vegas, NV radio KDWN, hosted by Art Bell and sponsored by the Robert Bigelow Foundation. A sev- enty-five meter net was discussed at that time when it was found that Art Bell was also a ham radio operator. Prior to this date David A. Eckhardt (W6LEV) in Albuquerque, NM was invited to organize a forty meter net for the western states.

This network has members in Australia, Canada. South Africa, and the United States. It is a closed network for MUFON members only, however it does have a public access.
