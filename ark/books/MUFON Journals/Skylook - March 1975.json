Witnesses: Peter, 24, and his wife Frances, 21. Investigated by: Carl Van Vlierden, MUFON representative from South Africa. Written by: Dwight Connelly, SKY- LOOK editor with- assistance from Joseph M. Brill, International Coordin- ator. Multiple effects described by couple Peter and Frances, traveling from Salisbury, Rhodesia, to their home in Durban, South Af- rica, on the night of May 30- 31, reported that i.n a five- hour period between .2:30 a.m. and 7:30 a.m. one or both ob- served two . UFOs, experienced effects on their car's lighting system, felt the \"loss of con- trol\" of the auto's steering, observed \"occupants,\" got a look at the interior of a UFO, and experienced the mysterious transportation of their auto over a distance of many miles. Some of these experiences came to light only after Peter was later hypnotised by a medi- cal doctor. The first hint of what was to come was the observation by both Peter and Frances of a \"person\" alongside the road, 10 kilometers (6 miles) south of Umvuma, Rhodesia, about 2:30 a.m. . Frances said she at first thought it was a policeman, and she was concerned because Peter was exceeding the speed limit. The \"person\" had something \"like a box\" or a \"walkie-talk- ie\" in his hand, she said. Peter said he did not think it was a policeman because it was too \"metallic.\" Both wit- nesses agreed that the suit worn by the person shined. \"It Salisbury RHODESIA Shebani • Ft. Victoria Beit Bridge ^MAZAMBIQUE SOUTH AFRICA didn't look natural,\" said Frances. She looked back as soon as; the \"person\" was pass-- ed, but saw nothing. About ten seconds later Frances says she saw a light which she thought must be a house at the top of a hill. \"I commented on the fact that someone must be up late,\" she recalled. \"Then I thought it must be a communications tower, as the light was a lot higher. Then it started to revolve like a lighthouse.\" It was \"revolv- ing\" on and off, she said. The light, \"which was on the oassenger side, seemed to keep pace with the auto. \"It .looked very, very close,\" according to Frances, but the distance was impossible to determine because the size was not known. Frances described the light as being \"very bright, almost blue in its brightness.\" She could not determine either the size or the shape.:. Peter commented 'that the auto's lights seemed to be fad- ing, and Frances noted this al- so. Then the lights appeared to go out completely. The auto : was going about 140 kilometers per hour (90 m.p.h.) when the lights had begun to dim : (in- cluding the ..interior dash lights). ... '. .! The car's ignition , did not seem, to be . affected, /and the radio continued to play. The car was running smoothly, going \"like a bomb,\", according - to Peter.' - - -.- . ;. ' '.'..'' / \"There was an immense. 1ight around the car,\" explained Peter, and he was able to see without his car lights, which, as noted, had gone : out ,com- pletely. The 1ight •surrounding the car was described as a \"bluish daylight-type '!neon bulb, bright enough' to\" cast shadows.\"  ! The ca r became very cd1d, according to the r witnesses, ' so they turned on the car's neater which seemed to operate normal- ly. However, the car still did not, warm up, so the couple put on heavier clothing and wrapped themselves in blankets. St'i 11 the car was coldo - \"I've traveled that ;; area •many, many times,\" said Peter, \"and I've never experienced cold like that. -The interior : of the car just-turned iinto'a refrigerator.\" He remarked that the temperature had dropped \"very, very quickly,,\" No control over auto Peter alsp discovered! that he had.no control over the car. \"I couldn't stop-the car,,! 1 he said.- \"I had\" no power -over braking, I put my foot on the brake and it went Jn the 'normal distance, but had no effect.\" •Even when he took'nis foot off the accelerator, he said, the car continued its-'speed. , Peter related that he like- wise \"had no power'over steer~ ing, and no power over handling of the car.\" Frances said she Page 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Editor's Note This report may be con- sidered a bit \"far out\" in terms of what the witnesses allegedly experienced, and SKYLOOK takes no position one way or the other as to whether the account is true. We do feel, however, that it has enough merit to be printed. We feel this way for the following reasons: (1) The investigator of the case has proven to be careful and reliable in the. past, and he says, \"I get a good impression of the wit- nesses, and Peter was cer- tainly in a deep trance,, I see no reason why they should say anything about their experience but the truth as THEY experienced iU \" (2) This is a two-witness sighting, and therefore more likely to be reliable than a single-witness report, even though the two are man and wife and even though only one could be successfully hypnotized. (3) The added dimension of hypnosis, while not conclu- sive, does provide one type of additional evidence. (4) There have been other reports with certain simil- arities to this case. At the same.time it must be noted that there are many unanswered questions regard- ing this case, and some as- pects of it seem incongruent and/or illogical. The account is as accurate and complete as we can make it at this, point. The wit- nesses have asked that their last names not be used, but we do have their full names and addresses on file. \"noticed nothing. Of course the car was under perfect con- trol. It was like automatic pilot.\" Peter concluded that he could have \"gotten into the back seat\", and the car's con- trol would not have been affec- ted. African bus abandoned The couple now noticed what they considered a very unusual sight alongside the road. An African bus was on the side of the road with all its lights on, including the interior lights, but there was no sign of anyone. The bus, with all its doors open, was sitting in front of an African trading post. \"There should have been people there,\" said Frances, \"but there was not a soul in sight.\" Peter explained that it appeared that everyone had gotten off the bus to eat, \"but they normally don't. They sit in there cooped up like chick- ens. They take all their goods with them. They even use the bus for a toilet. Nobody gets off.\" Frances agreed: \"Normally the bus would be piled high with chickens and bicycles and suitcases, but there wasn't anything.\" Having observed what was for them one unusual vehicle, they saw a second \"mysterious\" bus only 7 to 10 kilometers farther down the road. The first bus had been facing in the direc- tion the couple were traveling, but the second bus was facing toward them. There was no store or other building near the second bus, but it likewise showed no sign of life. \"They weren't even parked in the lay-by, and they get hefty fines if they are found by the side of the road not parked in a lay-by,\" Frances explains. \"It's a danger to traffic. No bus driver will park on -the side of the road if he can pos- sibly help it.\" Peter added, \"If he's broken down, he puts up his triangles.\" It was now possible to ascer- tain that the UFO was oval in shape, and it seemed to be either casting a beam of light to the horizon or receiving a beam which was cast from the horizon. It was \"a very defin- ite light source,\" according to Frances. The car was still surrounded by the bright light, the witnesses reported. As they entered the outskirts of Ft. Victoria, Rhodesia, the object \"just shot down and van- ished over the horizon, like a shooting star.\" Peter now re- gained normal control of the auto. It was 4:30 a.m. by the car clock when they stopped at Ft. Victoria for fuel, and the auto took the normal amount of gas- oline. The native attendant was the only person they had seen since observing the shiny \"per- son\" with the \"walkie-talkie\" alongside the road two hours earlier. Lights operate after stop The attendant said he not- iced that something was wrong with their lights as they came into Ft. Victoria. However, when the lights were switched back on after the stop, they seemed to work normally again. The native attendant also expressed surprise that the couple were dressed so warmly and that they had wrapped them- selves in blankets. Frances remarked to the attendant that it was cold, and he replied, \"Is it?\" The attendant was dressed in shorts. The couple went to the rest room, repacked the car, and Peter checked the car's wiring. He found nothing wrong with the Peugeot 404 sedan. After about an hour at Ft. Victoria, where Page 4"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"they saw no person other than the attendant, they., continued their'-'-:Journey:- ; towards Beit Bridge and Durban, South Afri- ca. \"- : \\ .' • ' \" About 10 or 12 kilometers (6 to 8 mifles) beyond Ft, Victoria the couple again saw the UFO, but there was also another one above them. The one above seem- ed to be either smaller or higher than the one oh the left side, '-•  : : . \"It appeared suddenly as a- pin.prick- of light above us, 1 , 1 said.: Frances. The car lights were,v still working normally; buf the:blue neon-like light Was also above them again. • He again loses control of car Oiice again, however, Peter had no -control over the auto, which was moving at \"an impos- sible speed.\" From 120 kil- ometers per hour (80 m.p'.ho) outside Ft. Victoria, the speedometer showed 130, 1^0, 170, -\"then off the top of the scale,\" which was 190 (120 m.p. h.) according to Peter. •- There was very 1ittle.engine noise, he .said, and little wind noise or sensation of speed, leading him to conciude ; that the speedometer cable had brok- en. Frances said she • was not aware of the speed.of the auto. Peter-also noticed that they were travel ing through what ap- pea red to be a swampy area, even .though there are.no swamps in that part of Rhodesia. \"It is very'dry in that area,\" ex- plained Peter, \"but on this oc- casion it looked very wet and the vegetation looked very lush.\" , The road itself was quite dry. Frances said she was not as aware of the wetness of. the area, because she was looking more upward than.outward,., but she noted that there were trees and lush tropical vegetation, even though the area is norm- ally dry, with only an odd tree here and..there. She also not- iced water weeds. Investigator Carl -van VJier- den said that his sources a- greed that there were no swamps in that area, which :is. ; very dry.  . .- The couple also noticed that the normal sounds, such as crickets and locusts, were not to be heard. \"It was as though someone had switched the .sound off.\" They saw ho animals or .other, signs of life. /The radio was sti11 on, and : theVrorigihal. radio program of Jazz .,'from 'Lourenco , Marques, Mozambique, ..had been coming .in well. Howeverj at about 5:^*5 a.m., ,the radio quit receiving'. \"There was- nothing,\", said Fra'n- • ces. • .' • •'\"'.•.''•• .About 6:15 a.m., when day- light began to replace the night, Frances says she fell a- sleep. Peter had just turned the headlights off. — Frances recalls that there was \"no pink tinge of breaking dawn. It just gradually • got lighter and lighter.-\" Although this was a time when many animals were normally seen, none was observ- ed.   '- - Peter feels hypnotized About the time Frances said she went to sleep, Peter said he began to feel, hypnotized by the dots or \"solid stream\" of the.center line marking on the roach .. He said it was \"like the in- itial stages when one prepares himself for astro travel.\" (Peter says he began \"astro traveling\" when he was 14, but quit when he was about 19 be- cause Frances did not like for him to do it.) \"It was exactly the same sensation as when one is parting from one's own soul,'V said Peter in describing his feelings after Frances went to sleep. . At about 7 a.m., or k$ min- utes after Frances said she fell asleep, .they arrived at Beit Bridge\" on the South Afri- can border. Peter had again regained control -of.the,car a- bout 3 kilometers (2 .miles) outside Beit Bridge. He noted, that he had no recollection of having seen the sun until they reached Beit Bridge. They were surprised to dis- cover that the journey had tak- en about an hour less than an- ticipated. They had, in fact, traveled 288 kilometers (180 miles) in 1 hour and k$ min- utes, or at an average speed of about 100 m.p.h. :' They were even more surprised to discover that their gas tank was still nearly full when they tried to fill it at! Beit Bridge. The auto took ;6nly 2 liters (2 quarts) of gas, or a- bout 22 cents (South African) worth, despite the fact they had traveled 186 miles since fi11 ing the tank. In checking .the odometer to determine the. mileage recorded, they found that it had regis- tered only 17 kilometers (10 miles) from Ft. Victoria to Beit Bridge instead of the ac- tual distance of 288 kilometers (180 miles).  '; When they arrived at the South Africa border check point at Beit Bridge they, noticed that a clock on a tower indi- cated the time as 8:3.0: a.m\"., whereas the time indicated by the auto's clock and the wit- nesses' watches was 7:15. A wall clock inside the customs office also showed 8:30. The men in the customs of- fice turned on the. radio to check the time, and it. was found that the time was 7:15, and that the two clocks' at the border were indeed incorrect,, The customs men did not know how long the clocks had been incorrect, since Peter and Frances were the only persons to have crossed; the border up to that time. The couple noted that had they made .the trip in .^the ex- pected amount .of time, it would indeed have been .8:30 when they arrived, instead of 7:15. The two objects had . been Page 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"visible when the couple arrived at Beit Bridge, but Peter and Frances had not pointed them out to the two men on duty at the border. Frances says the objects appeared \"metallic\" in the daylight, as when ah air- plane reflects the sun. The two objects had \"gone up to- gether\" and were now very smal1. The couple went inside the customs office, and when they emerged from the,off ice the ob- jects could no longer be seen. Since the reported exper- ience, both witnesses say they have experienced changes in themselves. Frances, who was previously known for her \"photographic memory,\" now has difficulty re- membering simple things. She says her memory is \"very poor,\" and Peter says, \"She has become the dumb blonde.\" Frances experiences prophetic dreams Frances also has had five dreams since the sighting, which she considers prophetic. She could not remember three of the dreams, when queried by Invest- igator van VI ierden on Dec. 1, but she did relate two. One concerned the completely unexpected separation of a re- cently-married couple, and the other concerned a dream that she would be given 10 rand to spend as she pleased (she re- ceived the 10 rand the very next day as a surprise gift at the office where she works as a secretary). Peter, who says he had had the ability to use mental te- lepathy since he was T», seem- ingly lost his ability as a re- sult of the experience. The auto, has likewise ap- parently been affected by the experience. The tires, which are \"cheap recaps,\" were placed on the car in Rhodesia as a temporary measure until such time as regular tires could be purchased in South Africa The tires on Peter and Frances' Peugot reportedly refuse to wear out. (Peter explained that tires were much cheaper in South Af- rica than in Rhodesia). . However, the tires refuse to wear out, according to Peter. \"They're just not wearing,\" he says. \"We've done 7,000 kilo- meters (nearly M,000 miles) on those tires and there's just no wear.\" Peter says he has even taken the car out on bad roads and tried to \"rip off\" the retreads without success. He asserts that they are \"as good as new\" after eight months of wear. Peter and Frances also report that the car has quit using oil. They previously added oil once a month. On the negative side, Peter reports trouble with the car's starter, alternater, bearings, rotors, coil, lights, indica- tors, and carbon leads. He said that \"a majority of the trans- mission\" had to be replaced. No check was made on the auto for possible radioactivity or magnetism. The preceding \"account was based on an interview by In- vestigator van VIierden of Peter and Frances in their home in Durban, South Africa, on Dec. 1, 197**, as well .as on MUFON report forms which they filled out on Nov. 28, 197^. The following is based on a hypnotic session conducted by Dr. Paul Obertik, a medical doctor, on Dec. 3, 197^, at the suggestion of Investigator van VIierden. The doctor was se- lected by the investigator, who was present during the session. While Peter proved to be an apparently good subject for hypnosis, Frances did not, so her brief session is not in- cluded. Readers should be aware that the following account is taken from an audio tape of the ses- sion, and that it was sometimes difficult to ascertain what was said. Neither van VIierden nor Dr. Obertik have had an oppor- tunity to check this account for accuracy.  '? The account of Peter's ex- perience, as brought out in the ( hypnotic session, began about - 12 kilometers (8 miles) outside Ft. Victoria. A UFO, about 300 yards above the auto, sent down a beam of light into the car In which Peter and Frances were riding. This \"gave the car a mind of its^wn,\" according to Peter. There were voices coming from the radio at one point telling him what to do. Impulses were being sent through the car radio. \"I tried to fight it,\" said Page 6"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Peter. He says a \"simulated screen\" was placed in front of the windshield and side windows of the car—from where he did not know. The simulated scenes were \"from somewhere else.\" 'Not on the road at all'during entire journey The auto was off the highway, and \"the entire journey was made off the tar,\" according to Peter. \"We went , .in a dead straight 1ine. We were not on the road at all.\" He said they did not touch the road again until about 3 kilometers (2 miles), .before reaching Beit Bridge. . Peter says his wife \"fell a- sleep, or was put to sleep\" by the radio, ; \"wh.ich was the voices,\" so she cannot remember this part of the journey. A form (humanpid?) was beamed into the back \"seat of the car, and sat there the entire jour- ney. Asked what the form look- ed like, Peter replied that he had been told-by.the form that he would see what he wanted to see \"in and around and at it- self. If I wanted it to look like a duck, it would look like a duck. If I wanted it to look like a monster, it would look 1 ike a monster.\" Under further probing by;Dr. Obertik, Peter said that \"the beings were physical and had \"the same basic forms as hu- mans.\" He explained that they had a \"large trunk, neck, hair- less, two legs, two arms.\" Peter said they had \"no form of reproduction organs,\" and that he ;did not know how they repro- duced „ He described them as \"mul- ti's,\" but did not explain what that meant. He did say that the beings were \"identical in size, shape, weight, color, looks.\" Peter said .''they took about seven seconds to..find out that I had .communicated with the past, that I had control over my mind to be.able to give my- self post-hypnotic suggestions. They, erased this, or tried to erase this, so I wouldn't be ,able to be hypnotized, and tell what happened inside the motor- car. I just can|t remember. They ; are very, very clever.\" ;•;.. He 'said the beings do exper- ience death, but -he does not know how long they live in Earth time. Peter said the be- ings come from an \"outer gal- axy,\" but they did not say pre- cisely/where. When asked if the beings could travel faster than the speed of light, Peter said, .\"They -travel by time, not light.\" ' 'He reports that the beings are friendly toward.Earth!ings, but do not want to make contact because \"there are too many people who wouldn't understand them.\". Asked if the beings . could make people understand . them, Peter explained that to make people understand \"would change the whole world, and they don't want to do that.\" Asked if the beings believe in God, Peter replied, \"No Gods.\" Peter said.he never went in- side the UFO, ;but he could see \"up the beam\" how things were inside. The \"machine\" had three levels, he said. The bottom level was the power unit. The second level included, the. 1 i-v- ing quarters, the engineering wing, and the communications. 1 The third, or top, level in- cluded the cockpit, the flight deck, and the inter-astro con- trol center. He said the entire unit was linked by two vacuum shafts. To use these shafts, one; placed oneself in the tube and was de- posited oh the level indicated. He said that transportation in- side the craft was by vacuum \"suckles.\" . the craft was 80 to 90.feet across, and about 60 feet high, according to Peter.. .He said there was a \"stabilizer: unit. 1 ,' in the \"laboratory section\" to simulate Earth, where any humans taken aboard -the,craft could be .placed to.have their surroundings ; , completely simu- lated. Peter said this section was_l\"just .empty space,\" but that, through ..suggest ion,. -the person would.see what the per- son wanted to see. . : In explain!ng-the propulsion system, Peter said that thrust on the horizontal plane was from the outer edge -of the craft, and that up and down movement was by direct up .or down thrust. Peter explains previous sighting Peter told Investigator Carl van VIierden that he had exper- ienced an earlier sighting of a UFO in July of 1964 while driv- ing a van outside Shabani, Rho- desia, about 60 miles west of Peter and Frances.' 197^ exper- ience. . He said he .was! driving the van, and that his father was a passenger. Peter said he came around a bend and saw . the saucer in the middle of the dusty road about four feet off the ground. . He said he had to brake in order to avoid a collision, but that the saucer, which was only 20 or 30 feet away, took off rapidly.   . . . Peter said the object,..which was a metallic gray, threw red and black dust into the air as it took off.. The dust was so hot, he said, that it was baked into the white paint of the van. The van had a load of elec- tric tuning equipment, accord- ing to Peter, and \"every diode and valve had to be replaced.\", Looking back on this^ sight- ing, Peter said, \"I realize that.this is a very long time ago, but,, as I said, it could have something to do with the fact that on the most : recent occasion we were picked.\" Page 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":".Rhodesia and ? Case similarities INTENSIVE COLD The temperature drop (In- terior of auto becoming cold) reported in the Rhodesia case (Peter and Frances) seems un- usual, but such a phenomenon is apparently not without paral- lel. On Sept. 24, 1974, Michael Byatt and Mrs. Pamela Wi11iams were driving between Bridgport and Maiden Newton, England, when the engine of their car began to lose power and the 1ights dimmed. \"All of a sudden it became intensely cold,\" Mr. Byatt told a reporter from the Dorset EVE- NING ECHO. \"I did not lose my lights altogether. There seemed to be an eerie presence.\" He said he observed a yellow- blue light in the sky in the form of an elipse. A registered gliding instructor and senior NCO in the Air Training Corps, Byatt said he could not identi- fy the light with any known flying object. TELEPORTATION/TRANSPORTATI ON The lifting of vehicles by alleged UFO's or other unex- plained forces, as in the Peter and Frances case, is not uncom- mon. SKYLOOK has reported such cases in the past, but some in- teresting cases not previously reported have been located by International Coordinator Joe Brill: The first case reportedly occurred in the early or middle part of July, 1969, in the southern tip of Brazil, near Floianopolis. Four businessmen (names available) were riding from Nova Hamburgo in a \"Kombi\" bus when they observed a \"fly- ing saucer\" at low altitude as they rounded a curve in the road. A beam of light reportedly emerged from the saucer and projected itself onto the bus, impairing the electrical system of the bus, including . Its lights. Then the bus was lifted into the ; a?r, seemingly by a powerful magnet located in the base of the saucer. Following a \"marvelous flight\" which terrified the men, the bus was placed softly upon another section of the road. The saucer, which was des- cribed as two basins set face to face and joined at the rims, was still shooting forth the beam of light in various col= ors. The men said the saucer stopped a second vehicle, a loaded truck with a license plate issued from the city of BiguacUo The second case, even more bizzare, reportedly took place in early May, 1968, in Argen- tina, about 100 miles south of Buenos Ai res. According to newspaper re- ports from Buenos Aires and Cordoba, as well as an account in FLYING SAUCER REVIEW, a well-known Buenos Aires attor- ney, Dr. Gerardo Vidal, and his wife were traveling from the town of Chascomus just before midnight to Maipu, about 93 mi les to the south. They were being preceded oh National Route 2 by another couple (names not known) in a- nother auto. According to Dr.. Vidal's account, he and his wife were leaving the suburbs of Chascomus when a \"dense fog\" suddenly appeared in front of them. From that moment, they were unable to account for the next 48 hours. In the meantime,- the couple preceding the Vidal auto had backtracked in an effort to lo- cate Dr. and Mrs. Vidal, but they were unsuccessful. When the Vidals \"came to,\" it was daylight and the car (a Peugot 403) was parked, with them still inside, in an un- known lane. Unhurt, but with neck pains and a feeling that they had slept for many hours, they got out of the car. The surface of the car was burned, as though with a blow- torch, but it was in perfect operating condition. Their watches had stopped. After inquiry, the Vidals discovered they were no longer in Argentina, but in Mexico— 4,000 miles from where they had encountered the \"fog.\" Dr. Vidal found the Argentine Con- sulate in Mexico City and phoned relatives (the Rapallini family) in Maipu to inform them of their whereabouts. According to FSR, the Vidal's car \"was sent off to the United States for scientific study, and it was arranged that he would receive another car of the same make in replacement of Page 8"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"it.\" No additional information is given concerning who con- ducted the investigation, or its results. V . ..-. ,-. The Vidals then took~ : a plane back to Buenos Aires, where Mrs. Vidal. was. taken .to a.pri-- vate clinic for treatment of: a nervous disorder.;' ,- .

SKYLOOK i.s aware. '.'.;; >1rs... V i da 1 reported 1 y d i ed in- 1969, a victim of leukemia. The third case also involves a \"white cloud\" or fog, and this one allegedly took place in 1968 or 1969. ,S.r. Marcilo Ferraz and his wife were driving south from San Paulo, Brazil, when they encountered a \"white cloud\" near the Uruguay border, they passed out, and woke up in Mex- ico. Both .reportedly suffered traumatic shock. The husband allegedly consulted a doctor a few weeks later and was told he had ; a brain tumor. Shortly after that, he reportedly shot himself. The fourth' case also involves a \"white cloud\" or fog, but only a ' single witness, an 11- year-old girl. \" . On Aug. k, 1968, Graciela del Lourdes', who lived in a_ suburb of Cordoba, Argentina, was looking out the front door of her home when \"a white; cloud, like mist\" appeared on the front, path and gradually came toward her, she said. \"I could no longer see the other houses, and I ..couldn't move, or call out to Mummy,\" she explained. Then she..found herself \"on a square where there were lots of people,\" later identified, as the, Plaza Espana in Cordoba. • ..

A sixth case, also with few details, also allegedly occur- red in Rio Grande do Sul., Bra- zil in 1968<, Two young men were in a.-Jeep when they ran -into.; white fog near Porto Alegre. They passed out, and when they awoke they also found themselves in Mexico. A seventh, case, also with spotty detail, reportedly in- volved two persons (names un- known), traveling on the Presi- dent Dutra Motorway (Brazil) who were transported to an un- named town in the U. S. which is near the Mexican border. According to the newspaper DIARIO de NOTICIAS in Rio de Janeiro (Jan. 15, 1969), the car \"bore marks made by the hooks of the transporting ve- hicle.\" An eighth case involves not a motor .vehicle, but a horse— although the horse apparently was not moved. On the night of April 20, 1969, Sr. Dolor Roque was allegedly riding his horse : near Itaucu, Brazil, on his way to a pharmacy, when he \"saw some lights\" and lost cons- ciousness. When he awoke at dawn he found himself, without the horse, on some rocks .on the bank of the river Paranaiba at Itumbiara, 250 miles from Itaucu (about 150 miles as the crow flies). He took a bus back home, where he found a worried family and his horse, which .apparently had come home by itself.  \"]\"~ A ninth case likewise in- . volves ho motor vehicle.

A WORD OF CAUTION , SKYLOOK readers are cautioned that most of the above' cases lack significant details, and investigations have ranged from hardly adequate to zero. The cases are included to indicate possible patterns, but none has been evaluated by MUFON or SKY- LOOK. =• The possibility of suggest- ability on the part of witness- es in this area of Brazil and Argentina cannot be ruled out, especially in view of the fact that, so many reports of this nature have been publicized by the press in that general area.

Location: La Spezie, Italy (population: 200,000) Submitted by: Joe Brill, International Coordinator. By Dr. Marco Marianti MUFON Representative for Italy On July k, 1973, at 2200 hrs. (10 p.m.) several persons (men and women) watched a luminous great \"ball of fire,\" which was round and reddish, come down from the sky at about 80 de- grees with the ground toward the wires of an electric power line, and then level to some tens of meters from the soil, fly over the hills and down two valleys (up and down following the ground elevations), and then disappear out of sight just behind the top of the last hill. It did this very slowly. Some fifteen minutes later, the \"ball of fire\" rose up from behind the top of the same hill, at the same site, into the sky. Then it turned to the right abruptly and disappeared out of sight. Just behind the top of that hill (where the UFO had been seen to go down and later rose) there are four strange prints in a wild area. They are about the same size and you can see the \"plaster cast\" of the clearest print, but no one had seen the UFO on the ground (the supposed landing area is out of sight from all the houses, in a remote place^ about on the top of that hill, just behind it). The witnesses were sure that the \"ball of fire\" was under intelligent control because it appeared to fly following the slopes and countours of the hills and valleys. No news- paper reported this sighting, but one of the witnesses called , me by telephone. The cast from imprint \"B.\" Note the broken tiles in the bottom of the print (cast is upside down). THE LOCALITY (a) Location of the witness- es: Ponzano Magra Inferiore is a group of 15 to 20 houses sixteen kilometers east of La Spezia. The witnesses were sitting in the open air to re- fresh themselves. The surround- ings are wooded hills. (b) The. site of the UFO land- ing: Near the top of the hill and all around are wild wooded hills and ravines. About 100 meters from the site there is a pylon of an electric power line (130,000 volts). One of the largest electric power plants in Europe is located in La Spezia. THE LANDING SITE Mr. Stelio Asso of La Spezia, my friend and director of a good local association (GORU), went there the next day with two other \"ufologists.\" \"\\ The landing site is very strange: in the right side of the little gravel road (a mule track, with no traffic of course) there is a deep valley and the lorries of the factory St. Louis group plans Piedmont trip The regular monthly meeting of the UFO Study Group of Greater St. Louis on Feb. 9 featured a demonstration of a UFO detector by Forest Craw- ford, a report by investigators Frank Brown and David Lewis on a possible cow mutilation, and a tape recording of an alleged spaceguide presented by Joe KrulK Brown announced that a field trip to Piedmont, Mo-, is being planned for the weekend of April 18-20.

UFO, creature sightings r By Stan Gordon Reports of not only UFO's,.- but. sightings of various types of creatures near Gibsonia, .-• Pa., have been keeping Pennsyl- vania Center For UFO Research investigators busy since July, '\\S7b, when the reports began. Beginning in July, sightings of Bigfoot-like creatures were originating ' from a trailer court in the area. A creature was seen .looking into the win- dow of a trailer at a female resident. The Woman described it as being 7i to 8 feet tall, and having very, large glowing green eyes c Several days later, several claw marks were found in a screen which were too high for a cat to have done. Other residents of the trailer park reported to .police that there, was a prowler in the area. One- resident, 'who refuses to talk, returned to his mobile home to find the door knob pulled off. One interesting note is that one family who \"had trouble with the mystery prowler reported that on two occasions their young children had nightmares about UFO's, and during one of these instances when the child awoke, the father looked out- side and saw a UFO. hovering nearby. PCFUFOR investigators search- ed an abandoned tunnel in the\" area of-.the creature sightings, and came across several three- toed footprints, T» inches in length from the heel to toe. The toes were 3A\" deep into the soil and there were three - inches between the toes. There were a large number of pigeon feathers in the immediate area of the prints. Some of the feathers still had fatty tissue upon them,, Also about the same time this activity was occurring, just a short distance down the road a large UFO reportedly dived down on a gas station. The owner 'of • Cost of one of several three-toed prints found. the station and an .'. employee described the object as about 80 feet long, oblong in shape, with a dark dome, A number of revolving lights were seen a- round 'the \"outside structure. . One customer reportedly was so scared by the sight that he ran into -the rest room and locked the door. The object came out of the N.E. and dived to within 300 feet of the ground. It then climbed in al- titude and was out of sight in a matter of seconds. There was no sound from the.object, ac- cording to witnesses. .There were other reports in the area of lights in the sky, as well as low-level observa- tions in the weeks to follow. Then, in September, even stranger reports were being made by local residents. There had been several encounters with a tall human-like figure- dressed in a silver metallic sui t. The first incident involved a young couple who were driving down a back road when the fig- ure was seen on the side of the road. They reported that the figure raised his hand, and the lights of the car went out and the vehicle stopped. The figure then' approached the car and flashed a bright light which seemed to emit, from a cube- shaped device at the two young people. The,couple, after the experience, -ran into a local .establishment .. to report the event. About an hour and a half later, a man in a truck.report- .ed a similar event. Several .other incidents of this nature occurred during September. By far the strangest story of all occurred about 8:30 p.m. on Dec. 30 near the Turnpike Bridge. A lone woman driver was. returning home from work when in front of her car she saw what was described as ,\"a metal lie spider.\" . She said the .thing was about two feet in diameter, 12 i.nches in height, and that there def- initely were joints, like spi- der legs, which she believes were eight in number. The top section was glowing when hit with her head! ights', but the bottom half was dark. The legs appeared to be metal lie, rather than organic, in structure. The driver was going too fast when she came across the \"thing\" and she ran over it in her Volkswagen. She .heard no sound, and felt no impact when this occurred. When she arrived home she was quite hysterical, according to her husband. He returned to the spot, a short time after the incident occur- red, but was unable to find anything.

Pennsylvanians report 300 sightings By Stan Gordon The year 197^ brought over 300 UFO sightings to the Key- stone State. A breakdown of the types of sightings has not yet been completed; however, besides lights in the sky, there were low level, chases, physical damage cases, occupant and creature sightings, and near landings. At this time, a general study of the reports indicates that approximately 95% have a natur- al explanation. But sightings of unexplained aerial phenomena continue to persist. Already several dozen UFO sightings have been reported in 1975. On Jan. 2, at 1 p.m., several women observed a bright silver circle moving through jthe sky near McKeesport. That same ev- ening numerous residents near Irwin and Jeanette reported ob- serving a large circular dark object with rotating lights on the bottom. On Jan. 10, several UFO sightings were reported in- Westmoreland, Indiana, and Al- legheny counties. The first report was from a doctor and his nurse who observed a bright white circular object with a red light on the right side. The object made a high whine, and moved in a circular motion. The doctor had been a UFO skep- tic until seeing this. Near Bethel Park in the Pittsburgh area,, witnesses ob- served a bright round white light with four streams of smoke at the bottom that was moving fast across the sky. Then on the evening of Jan. 31, police departments in var- ious sections of the Pittsburgh area were receiving UFO re- ports. Most of the reports were of a solid blue luminous disc that moved horizontally a- cross the sky at a fast rate.

Included among the witnesses were the pilot and co-pilot, comrades Volkov and Berezhnoy, and the flight engi- neer, Y.N. Golubenko.

Translation was by Dr. Willard P. Armstrong. BACKGROUND This case was described In detail in a story by Pere Redon and Joan Crexells in the Decem- ber, 197^, SKYLOOK, page 3 through 1, Maximiliano Iglesias Sanchez, a truck driver, was driving a truck between the village of Horcajo de Montemayor and La- gunilla about 2:15 or 2:30 a.m. on March 21 when he observed a very strong white light on the highway. He eventually saw that some- thing was resting on the high\" way. At this point his lights went out and the truck engine die'd. The light from the object was now less intense, and be observed a metallic \"ship\" (UFO) on the road, and another hovering -nearby. From the right of the object on the ground, two \"beings\" ap- peare'd. But they returned to the object, and it- rose into the air. Maxi started the truck and everything, including the lights, worked. He drove past the landing site, stopped about 500-600 feet down the road, looked back, then went home. That same day at about 11:15 p.m., he was returning over the same route when he again saw a bright light at the same loca- tion as previously. There were three lighted ob- jects on the ground, and he ob- served four \"beings.\" The four appeared to see Maxi, and began Page 16 walking-toward him. He ran from the truck, which had experi- enced failure of engine and lights, followed by the beings. Maxi jumped into a drainage ditch and hid successfully. After the beings had quit searching, he walked away from the area, but returned a short time later to the truck. He. could not get the engine to re- spond, but he again attracted the attention of the beings. This time they> returned to the \"ship\" and it lifted from the road. Now he was able to start the truck, so he turned on the lights and \"buzzed out of there.\" However, he. stopped., about 600 feet down the: road and re- turned to see what the beings were doing. He saw that they were, .using two -toolsr—one-..-in the form of a capital T and the other -shaped like a . large horseshoe—to work on an. earth- en embankment of the highway. After observing about three minutes his fear became strong- er than his curiosity, so he returned to the truck, started it, and left the : area. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Additional, research on the case has been done by D. Vi- cente Rico Gil, of Bejar, a .staff member at-the Administra- tion of Justice; The witnesSj Maxi Iglesias, had left for military duty, so he was not available. However, other in- formation was obtained. THE WITNESS It was determined that Maxi had lived in .the home- of the owner of the truck, D. A1uil- ino, and came and wen.t without any particular notice. -On. the morning ^following his chase by the '.'be ings, \"sev- eral persons, including the owner of the truck, the civil guard, and neighbors : 1iving near where the truck was parked observed him wearing coveralIs covered with dried mud. Only D. Aquilino was 'told how the coveralls became soiled. THE TRUCK The truck is of the >\"Avia\" make with' a \"diesel-'-engine. A new -battery had\" been\" iiistal led only a\" few weeks • before the sightings. Following the sight- ings the battery was taken to a garage - (the Roger •- shop- in Bejar), where it was determined that it had been completely discharged. • THE OBJECTS (\"SHIPS\") \"The two objects of the first sigh'ting and the three-of : the second were identical, except for a variation in luminosity. The landing pods were drawn out from the central point on \"the bottom of the objects, and-had the form of tripods. Their length was estimated to be 18 inches. The interiors ofr the objects were not in view during either observation, and\" the witness could not tell-how the beings entered or left the objects. THE TERRAIN Investigator D. Vicente Rico visited the site some weeks after the sighting in the-com- pany of D. Valeriano Garcia Guijo, a resident of Horcajo de Montemayor,- who is a truck driver very familiar with the area. . . . • . r . It was established that the site was. at number 7 kilometers between hectometers 2 and 3 of highway 135 from Bejar to So- toserrano. The site is thus 1 kilometer .(six-tenths . of a mile) from Valdehijaderos in the direction of Sotoserrano, and 3 kilometers (2 miles) from"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Horcajo de Montemaydr in the direction of Bejar. The area is,made up of pas- tures and woodlands, with very little land in cultivation. The production of cattle is the major source of income. POSSIBLE CORROBORATI ON Do Valeriano Garcia said that on the night or early morning of the sightings (March 22) the family and friends of a de- ceased resident of Horcajo de Montemayor were waiting for other friends and relatives to arrive from Barcelona. While looking toward the roaa they saw \"a great illumination\" about 3 kilometers away in the direction of Valdehijaderos (this estimate of distance, .if accurate, would place the light at the site of the a 1leged ob- servations). Corrections for February SKYLOOK Three correction? have been received from authors concern-' ing articles in the February, 1975, SKYLOOK: •Len Stringfield advises us that the creature case (Cove- dale area, , Western.Cincinnati) reported on pages 3-6 (and in the listing of humanoid reports received by Bloecher and Webb, page \"/) took place on Oct.21, 1973, not on Oct. 12. Stringfield also advises that the reference to the size of the shield in the above article (first column, page 4) should read: By Mrs. Heitfield's esti- mate, the object or she!Id was approximately 7 feet in diam- eter. (Not 15 feet) Ernest Berger advises us. that .the next to last . paragraph in the Bavarian-Alps case .\"(pages 8-11) should read: Geological maps do indicate major tectonic faults running through the flap area.... • . - Recapping and commenting By Richard Hall (This column is directed to- wards articles appearing in the January, 1975, edition of SKY- LOOK) .

Both cry for follow-up, and suggest the possible need for a MUFON committee to bulldog se- lected cases that have a high potential for yielding techni- cal data and technological clues. The .first (9-16)/includes E- •M, effects (total), vibratory noise, electrical shock, and an odorous gas~an impressive ar- ray despite the lack of a clear-cut associated UFO (only .light in the sky). Immediate examination of the car by. a mechanic js reported, and later a thorough garage ex- amination.. Numbness, welts, etc., reported by the witness were checked by.a doctor. One hopes TUFOIC (the Tasmanian group) obtained statements from al1 these people.. Since,all this happened ab- ruptly on a bridge, some data on the bridge should be obtain- ed. '. ' '. The second case (9-22) in- volved a very clear-cut UFO, apparently - close by, yet the only E-M effect on the car was a radio\" noise. The woman's straightened hair and the re- moval of dust and dirt, from the front of the car are suggestive of. static electricity. 'In neither case is the year and make of car and data on the motors and electrical systems given. Detailed investigation and study of a few dozen .cases like this—with physical - and physiological effects whose dy- namics can be explored after the fact—would be worth far more than thousands of i fly-by reports. j I agree wholeheartedly with Stan Gordon's appeal fori multi- discipline research, :but con- fess to being baffled by hts logic in decrying \"the problem of disbelief\" by UFOlogists. Are Bigfoot-like creatures be- ing seen in conjunction with UFOs? Let's have the data. A list of cases by date • and lo- cation where this'link Ms made, based on direct observational evidence, would form a! basis for discussion on the merits of the data. : - • '• \\ I think some colleagues are skeptical that such a Ilink is being assumed, and question the validity of using it as a point of departure until compelling evidence is assembled. There are always a few re- ports floating around in which UFOs are 1 inked with everything from blobs to cyclopean mon- sters, but they do not consti- tute anything approaching a fact that we must accept. Stan does report a few UFO- creature cases in his 1J974 MU- FON symposium article, but they are buried among creature-non- UFO cases, which may be 'part of the problem. Ample reports ex-, ist of creatures and of UFOs; but how many exist.of creatures WITH UFOs, and how well-sub- stantiated are they? i PS I (Project Starlight In- ternational), whose instrumen- tation program seems extremely worthwhile, now claims/to have received a light signal! from a UFO transmitting the inverse of Pi (i ,e.,-about ~.3 or 3A10). It is not obvious how such a signal could be sent—or re- ceived. The article wa£ a news report rather than a technical report from PS I, but that needs explaining.   j Page 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"In Others' Words By Lucius Parish The latest'NATIONAL ENQUIRER articles on UFOs have appeared in the Jan. 28 (October sight- ings in Syracuse, N.Y.), Feb.

SAGA'S 1975 UFO ANNUAL is now on sale. This consists of reprinted material from the four 197^ issues of. SAGA'S UFO REPORT, plus one .new article and a couple of new- columns. Then, there is the SAGA ANNUAL, containing one UFO article (a reprint of Keel's N.C. Ufonaut story, originally published in SAGA several years ago). Next, there's the March issue of SAGA which has an excerpt from the forthcoming book by Weverbergh & Hobana, UFO'S FROM BEHIND THE IRON CURTAIN. . This concerns the 1908 explosion of- \"what- ever-it-was\" over Siberia. And, fina'l.ly, by the time yo.u read this, it should be .about time for the Spring issue of SAGA'S UFO REPORT. A condensation of Charles BerMtz's THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE can be found in the March issue Page 18 of ARGOSY. Dave Webb's 1973-YEAR OF THE HUMANOIDS is an excellent survey of the reports, involving UFO occupants which took place during the 1973 flap. If you're a data-gatherer,- Webb provides charts, graphs, comparisons with previous flaps, etc, If you just like to read Ufonaut accounts for entertainment (or fascination), you won't be dis- appointed either..Comprehensive reports of this type are sorely needed in UFO research and it is always a pleasure to-see one so completely done. The booklet may be ordered from MUFON for $3.00. If books dealing with astro- nomical mysteries intrigue you, I think you'll like Richard Baum's book, THE PLANETS: SOME MYTHS AND REALITIES. Baum dis- cusses a variety of subjects which have provoked controversy in astronomical circles for many years. Does the Moon have its own satel1ite(s)? Are there 23-mile-high •' mountains on Venus? Do the planets Neptune and Uranus have ring systems like those of Saturn? These are a few of the topics cover- ed. Even though the book-con- tains no direct references to UFOs (naturally!), there are accounts\" of anomalous observa- tions which were attributed to stars, planets, comets, etc., but which really sound far more like UFOs. At any rate, Baum presents the data and you can draw your own conclusions. The book is available from Halsted Press - John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 605 Third Ave. - N. Y., N. Y. 10016 for $8.95. Erich von Daniken's fourth book, IN SEARCH^ OF ANCIENT •GODS,-does : not contain' much new material, text-wise, but the sub-title—\"My Pictorial Evi- dence for the Impossible\"— summarizes the book's intent. This is a beautiful collection of photos—both in color and b 1 ack-and-wh i.te—dep let i ng many of the places and bits of evi- dence which von Daniken has set forth in his three previous books. In the space of '2kk pages, you will find a total of 37^* photographs. Von Dan!ken's basic theme must surely be fa- miliar to everyone by now, so this volume provides a good chance to thumb through the pictures at random. A beauti- fully-done book, and rather a bargain at,$8.95. The publisher is G. P.\" Putnam's Sons - 200 Madison Ave. - N.Y., N.Y. 10016 Eric 6 Craig-Umland's MYSTERY OF THE ANCIENTS must surely rank as one of the most unusual and speculative books to be published in some time. The authors contend that those peo- ple of mystery, the Mayas, were extraterrestrial ,- colonists. They cite various sources to back up their beliefs, but the entire concept is built on a rather skimpy framework of \"evidence.\" Agreed, there are several enigmas associated with the Mayas and the Umland broth- ers do cite some references which are quite intriguing, but I'm afraid their overall theory will not be-taken very serious- ly by either Ufologists, be- lievers in \"ancient astronauts\" or by authorities on the Mayan civilization. It is refreshing to see original thinking, but it must be supported by solid evidence. The book is published by Walker 6 Co. - 720 Fifth Ave. - N. Y«, N. Y. 10019; the price -is $7.95. Since Duncan Lunan announced his theory in 1973 that an in- terstellar space probe might be in ! orbit within the Earth-Moon system, quite a lot of discus- sion has centered around this topic.

At 10 a.m. on Feb. 12 we presented our slide lecture en- titled \"UFO's—A Scientific cussions of the Lunan theories, possible space visitations, the von Daniken theory, UFOs, etc. In IS ANYONE OUT THERE?, Stone- ley 6 Lawton suggest that the long delayed radio echoes which formed the basis for Lunan's theory can be explained by nat- ural means, rather than being signals from an extraterrest- rial probe. The material on UFOs is inadequate and errone- ous at times, reflecting the authors' apparent unfam?1iarity with the UFO evidence.
