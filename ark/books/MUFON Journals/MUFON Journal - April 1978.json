FROM THE EDITOR \"Close Encounters\" is hardly the expression for the strange reports reaching MUFON from all over the world. If even one-third of these reports is true, the need for urgent international scientific study is obvious. In this and the next several issues will be cases involving severe physiological effects in Uruguay, \"teleportation\" of a car in Belgium, physical evidence and possibly related physiological effects in northern California, and many similar reports. They, indeed, constitute a challenge to science — both in terms of retaining public credibility by investigating rather than debunking, and in terms of showing whether science can supply answers for the bizarre events so disturbing to so many people. If the answers are basically psychological, let the behavioral scientists investigate in depth and explain what is happening. If the answers are in the realm of the objectively physical, we are decades behind in mounting a vigorous scientific investigation. It is an understatement to say that the stakes are extremely high, not only for rational science as an institution, but also for humanity.

The incident was one of a series of UFO sightings that occurred in northwestern Uruguay in February and /, March, 1977, often leaving entire cities blacked out as UFOs were seen hovering over high tension power lines. The rancher is Angel Maria Tonna, 52, who owns 3,000 acres of rolling farmland (1,200 hectares) with some 730 head of cattle and numerous sheep. It is located 9 miles (15 kilometers) south of Salto, a city of 40,000 population on the Uruguay River. Tonna told the investigator that he and members of his family (wife, two sons, 19 and 22, and daughter, 15) and his 11 farmhands saw UFOs about a dozen times in February and March. The most serious incident occurred about 4 AM the morning of February 18 as he and his foreman, Juan Manueal Fernandez, were, herding about 80 cows into a barn to be milked. \"When I get up in the morning I usually turn the generator on, so I turned the generator on that morning and there were about 20 lights on (around the bam and other buildings),\" Tonna said. \"I was bringing the cows in to be milked and suddenly, about 4:10, all the lights went off. A bright light appeared on the east end of the bam (the far end from him) and I could see the barn's shadow. I thought it was a short circuit. I keep hay in that end of the bam for the cows and I thought it was burning. I jumped over the fence and ran toward the other end of the barn. Topo was with me. He was a watchdog and he always used to walk with me wherever I went around the farm in the mornings. \"Then I heard a noise . .. and the next thing I saw was a fire disc, like two plates facing each other. I stood there not knowing what to do. My foreman told me the cows were running away. The cows were going crazy, running everywhere, and all the dogs started barking. The object began to move. It broke the branches of a tree near the barn and moved across the barnyard to my right and hovered over some trees (about 100 yards to the south of the barn). \"It moved across the barnyard with a rocking motion,\" Tonna said, holding his hand horizontal and tipping it from side to side. The object sat about 60 feet above the trees for a moment and then moved to the right (east) and moved another 75 yards or so, halting lower and directly above a concrete bath that cows are forced to walk through to disinfect them, Tonna said. By this time he and Topo, a 3-year- old black and brown police dog weighing more than 60 pounds, had run back to the west side of the barnyard and climbed back over the fence again. They walked a few feet toward the UFO, now glowing bright orange, when it made another turn and began moving toward them, Tonna said. It came to a stop about 20 feet above the ground and next to a rectangular-shaped water tank. Dog Approaches UFO \"It was shining with a very bright light and lit up the whole barnyard,\" Tonna said. \"Topo ran toward the object to attack it but suddenly stopped on a little mound, sat down and began howling.\" He said that Topo was within 15 feet of the object and sat looking up at it. \"The object was about 60 feet (20 meters) from me,\" Tonna said. I saw six beams of light like small wings, in the shape of small wings, like lightning, three on each side. When the object turned toward me it felt like electric shocks went all over my body and a very intensive heat hit me. I put my arm up over my face to protect my eyes. \"I was scared in the beginning. For some reason I couldn't move. I felt attracted to the light. 1 don't know if I couldn't move or didn't want to.\" After several minutes the object began moving away, turning from bright orange to red. \"When it moved away it increased its speed as it was turning red and when it got to the forest (about half a mile to the south) it disappeared. After the object left, the generator started working again but it wasn't producing electricity because the wires were burned out,\" he said. The incident lasted about 10 minutes. Tonna's son, Tulio, 19, a second-year veterinary student at a university in Salto, said he had watched the whole incident from the house. Tonna said the farm workers usually get up around 4:30 AM and those awake at the time saw only a bright light in the area. \"Topo didn't eat anything after that,\" Tonna said. \"He walked around as he normally would but he wouldn't eat or drink anything. He stayed in the house all day, which wasn't normal. It was like with a said feeling.\" Disturbing Autopsy Report On the morning of the third day after the UFO incident, Topo's body was found on the very same mound where he had sat howling at the UFO. An autopsy was performed at the ranch (Continued on next page) 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"(Uruguay, Continued) by a veterinarian who teaches at the North University in Salto. He was assisted by Tulio Tonna and three other second-year veterinary students. The veterinarian refuses to discuss the case but he allowed Tulio to make a copy of the autopsy report. It said in part: \"The hair along the animal's spine was sticky but completely hard. The fat under the skin was found on the outside. The fat is normally solid, so to get to the outside it had to be melted and come through the pores. Once it was outside it solidified again. The animal was exposed to a very high temperature that can't be reached naturally by the dog. \"All the blood vessels had been bleeding very much and all the capillaries were broken. The rupture of the blood vessels was caused by an increase in temperature that couldn't be natural. The liver, normally dark and red, was completely yellow, caused by a high fever. All the blood vessels were yellow too. With all the blood vessels broken, the animal started bleeding inside and lost so much blood that 48 hours later the amount of blood he had circulated was insufficient and he died of a heart attack. \"When we took the skin off the dog, we didn't see any marks. He didn't have any bruises or anything . . . nor was the hair burned. The conclusion was that something very hot had caused this.\" Tonna said that the morning after the UFO incident, the underside of his right arm began hurting. He had turned that side to the UFO when he put his arm up to protect his eyes. Several days later Dr. Bruning Herrara, a Salto physician and a friend, stopped at the Tonna ranch for a personal visit. \"When I first went to Mr. Tonna's house I didn't know anything about the incident,\" Dr. Herrara told the investigator. \"I talked to him and he said he wasn't feeling very well and we started talking about the incident. What I saw on Mr. Tonna's arm was an irritation. His arm was completely red.. . My first conclusion was that the skin irritation was due to radiation caused by an extremely bright light. I didn't find any other irritation on any other part of his body. \"I recommended that Mr. Tonna have a special examination to see if he had been exposed to radiation but he refused to do it. 1 don't know why. I didn't want to prescribe any kind of medicine for Mr. Tonna because I first wanted to know if he had been exposed to any kind of radiation ... I didn't see him after that.\" Tonna's son, Tulio, explained that his father would have had to go to Montevideo, 200 miles away, for the examination and didn't want to take the time. He said his father doctored himself with home remedies. Circles and Tree Damage Tonna and his farmhands have found a number of mysterious dark green circles in some of his grazing pastures. In addition, two tall, healthy trees in a 10-acre stand of euclyptus trees planted 10 years ago were found pushed to the ground one morning. \"A worker found the trees,\" Tonna said. \"I couldn't believe it because there wan't any storm or any strong winds or anything that night.\" Curiously, both trees were in the outside row on the east side of the grove, which is about 3,000 feet long and 200 feet wide. Each tree was the eighth tree from the end, one from the north end and one from the south end, each had been pushed into the grove of trees. Tonna said that a dozen or more dark green circles have been found in pastures some distance from the house and farm buildings. Most measure about 35 feet across, while several are nearly 200 feet across. Showing one 35- foot circle about 2 miles from the house to the investigator, Tonna commented: \"When we found it the grass was burned, completely dead. Some time later we found mushrooms growing on the outer edge and then the grass grew dark green.\" He also found three circular impressions forming a triangle in the center of the ring, the impressions being about 10 feet apart. He also pointed out that the small rocks in the area were darker on the top than on the sides and bottoms, and appeared to have been burned. There were numerous sightings in the Salto and Paysando area, more than 20 in Mr. Tonna's neighborhood alone. I interviewed about 20 witnesses in the Salto area, but there are many more, maybe thousands. Once you interview one witness, he gives you the names of two or three more who saw UFOs. Police See UFOs Blackouts occurred in the cities of Salto, Paysando, and Young simultaneously and UFOs were seen over high tension towers during the blackouts. On my first visit to Salto on February 27, Police Officer Hector Lopez drove me around the area so I could talk to people who had reported seeing UFOs. Lopez, who at that time was in charge of the police station at Parada Daymen, several kilometers from the Tonna home, was one of several policemen who saw a brilliant UFO the night of February 22. (Lopez has since been transferred to another part of the country). Lopez told me he was sitting outside the police station that evening when he saw what he first thought was a flash of lightning, but the light continued, getting brighter and brighter. \"It was so bright it lit up the area like daylight,\" he told me. \"The light was so bright I could have seen a pin on the ground.\" Lopez called the other policemen outside so there would be other witnesses. Several climbed to the roof of the station but could see little more than what the men on the ground were seeing. Lopez then called Salto and Paysandu and learned that at this time there was a blackout in those cities. The same thing happened in Young. Lopez said that later the object seemed to fall apart. The next day he and severed other officers on horseback searched the power lines for several miles in both"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"directions. \"There was nothing on the towers, nothing on the ground, no burned grass, nothing. I was very surprised. I have no explanation for this phenomenon. The light was seen not only in Salto but in Paysandu... Almost everybody in Salto and Paysandu saw the light.\" Lopez told me the Paysandu police had also seen the light and had filed a report on it. Two other witnesses the same evening were Elida Eva Llovet de Gimenez, 56, who is in charge of the telephone exchange at Parada Dayman, and her husband, Angel de los Santos Gimenez, 62. The. phone exchange is near the police station and is separated from it by an elementary school house. \"At 10:10 PMI heard a loud noise,\" Mrs. Gimenez related. \"I went outside and saw a UFO over a high tension tower. It was shining a very brilliant light and it lit up an area about 2 miles around (3 kilometers). This tower is on Mr. Tonna's farm about 3 kilometers from here. It lit up the school and the police station too. All the radios went dead. The police saw it too. \"My husband climbed a pole and he was looking there and he heard a strange, funny noise, like when you touch two wires together. The light had some blue in it, but after a while it started changing to orange and then bright red. The size of the object seemed to decrease and after that it disappeared. We thought it was a short circuit in one of the towers and I called the electric power company and they said there was a blackout in Salto.\" There is a local organization in Salto that has been investigating the series of UFO sightings this year and one of its members, Alberto Ghizzoni, 42, submitted his findings. \"Many of the people of the city have seen the phenomenon. There have been many blackouts. On the night of March 24 and 25, a blackout lasted for half an hour. When it started, everybody went out of their houses and they saw a disc-shaped object going from south to north. It remained in the air and got higher and higher until it looked like a star with a reddish color. The UFO stopped over the northwestern part of the city. After a while it disappeared without moving, just faded out. The moment it disappeared, the lights began coming on again. The power and light company never gave any explanations. We personally interviewed an employee we know and he told us he was ordered to say that there was failure in the plant, but he was absolutely sure there was nothing wrong there.\" (For Journal readers' consideration, Uruguay is ruled by a military junta, is a poor country and nearly everybody needs two jobs to earn a living. Virtually everyone who works for the government is afraid to talk about these matters for fear of losing his job. This includes the veterinary professor and the power company employees.) Editor's note: MUFON's Represent- ative for Uruguay, Mario Rodriquez, 41, is considered to be one of that country's finest UFO investigators. He is an electronics engineer and director of the Department of Space Investigations for the International Press Association in Montevideo. He has been interested in UFOs for many years and has been investigating UFO cases for about 10 years. Mr. Rodriguez became MUFON's Representative during the First International UFO Congress in Acapulco, Mexico, when he was invited to join by Walt Andrus, International Director. Later information on this case. The rancher, Angel Maria Tonna, is now in very poor health. Until extensive medical tests are administered, it cannot be stated that it was due to close exposure to the UFO, which apparently was responsible for causing his dog to die. Mr. Tonna has been reluctant to travel to Montevideo, the capital, where adequate tests could be made. The physical well being of his prize bull started deteriorating shortly after this incident. This is such a strong case for the physical effects upon a human and animals, that it deserves continuous observation by those near the scene. Mr. Rodriguez promises to keep MUFON informed of the current status as significant new events occur. — Walt Andrus INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE, THURSDAY. MAY 18, 1978 Flying Object Baffles Computer With Maneuvers in Florida Sky OCALA. Fla., May 17 (AP)—\"I've never seen anytrung like it.\" says Timothy Collins, a Navy radar technician who tracked an unidentified flying object over the Florida sky. \"And I don't want to see anything like it again.\" He was among at least a dozen workers at the Navy's Pinecasile Electronic Warfare Range who said they spotted the brightly lit objects late Sunday. The Navy personnel, interviewed by the Ocala Star-Banner, saic' one object seemed to hover, then turned abruptly and sped off. Computer-equipped radar could not follow the UFO. they said. \"The computer wouldn't handle it, said Lt. Cmdr. John Sullivan, commander of the range, used by the Navy to train its combat pilots in tactics for avoiding enemy weapons. Robert Clark, duty officer on Sunday night, said curious civilians began calling, including one man who said he and seven others had seen an object 50 or 60 feet in diameter with flashing lights. The Naval Air Station at Jacksonville said no Navy planes were in the area.   .  • \"So we got out the binoculars and went up on the tower.\" Mr. 1 Clark said. \"We located an object due north, approximately 1,500 feet above the trees. We watched it for 15 or 20 minutes and it looked like it was pretty stationary.\" Then, he said, the object came up on the radar. \"We locked in on it and then all of a sudden it was gone,\" he said."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"THE REDDING, CALIFORNIA, MINING CASE ByPaulCcrny (MUFON Western Regional Director) An unusual and highly interesting case has come to us recently involving a man and wife hard-rock mining team. Clinton and Jane Chapin of Redding, California, are both 75 years \"young\" and still occasionally check in on their mining claim which they have operated for 40 years. The Chapins are unable to do any hard work at their claim like they used to. Jane had a heart attack some time back, and Clint had a stroke some years ago but still manages to drive his .small station wagon over back country roads. Both are presently in rather poor health, which they think may be a possible result of a dual UFO experience at their mining site. However, they still manage to get around when they are feeling somewhat better and frequent their mining site once or twice a week, which they refer to as \"home.\" Both have fairly good eyesight at distances in daylight; Clint's seems better than Jane's. Both use reading glasses, but a lot of us do! Jane has some difficulty in reading. Observation and describing the 2 daylight UFOs was not difficult. They have asked that the general locality of their mine not be published for obvious reasons. I have visited the site with the Chapins, looked the area over carefully, and taken photographs. Approximately 6 months had elapsed since the last and most violent UFO encounter of the second kind. The incident first came to us through KGO radio communicaster Al \"Jazzbo\" Collins, a talk show acquaintance. I had been a guest on his program a couple of times and an occasional caller as well. The Chapins had no prior knowledge of UFOs, nor any apparent interest except that they used to listen to another old miner, since deceased, tell of the many times he saw those \"strange objects\" zipping around the mining area. The first CE-II occurred at about 6 10:00 AM, October 30, 1969. The mine location is in the bottom of a hilly wooded canyon with each side averaging about 45 degree slopes. The height to the top is approximately 3,000 feet from the canyon bottom where a small dirt road and stream share the base of the canyon. At the mine location the canyon bottom flattens out varying 50 to 80 feet in spots. The canyon bottom is roughly 2,000 feet above sea level. In the summer it is very hot and dry. In the winter it gets quite cold with some snow and ice. In October it is bordering on the cold side. The Chapin's arrived at the mine location to do some work. As they were about to stop the car, they saw a rattlesnake of fair size stretched out in the middle of the road. As they each got out of the car on opposite sides, they noticed that it was stifling hot outside in this immediate area where farther back down the road it had been quite chilly. Normally, they do not see snakes in the canyon in October as it is already too cold for these reptiles. Still trying to determine why it was so hot in just this immediate area, they made preparations to kill the snake and bury the head under a rock as was their custom and precaution for themselves and other animals in the area. Jane took a picture of the snake with a small box camera shortly after Clint killed the animal with a shovel blade. At this point they were both simultaneously aware of something moving in the brush about sixty feet away to the east and off to their right where there was a flattened area of mine tailings. Suddenly an egg-shaped object with a flat bottom, about the size of a Volkswagen, rose up off the ground a few feet, then took off like a shot up the canyon, swaying but not striking small trees as it went. It raced up the canyon for 600 to 700 feet, then zoomed upward at about a 50 to 60 degree angle and was out of sight all within 2 to 3 seconds! The egg shape was described as half an egg shape or slightly less. There were no lights, windows, or protrusions of any kind visible in the brief observation. The object appeared cream in color to Jane, and light gray to Clint. No noise of any kind was heard, though they were only 60 feet away from it at the time. Both the Chapin's stood there gaping in stunned amazement at what they had just observed, not even venturing to guess what the strange and elusive object was. Jane stood there with the camera still in her hand, too dumbfounded and startled to have even thought to use it. After gathering their wits about them; they cautiously went over to the spot where they saw the strange device raise up and take off so hurriedly. They discovered an oblong or oval depressed spot measuring approximately 10 feet in diameter in the mixture of dirt and rock of the tailings that were scattered out in a flat area. The depression varied from 1 to 2 inches deep. With all of the heat they had experienced, they immediately felt the ground in the depressed area, expecting to find it hot, but to their surprise, it was cold as the ground anywhere around them. They also found that the depressed area was slightly discolored in appearance from the surrounding ground. After the UFO had left, the stifling heat in the area suddenly diminished and the temperature, or what appeared to be temperature, seemed to return to normal — on the cool side. Interesting speculation at this point would be: Was the heat possibly caused by a type of microwave radiation emanating from the strange craft? Did the Chapin's feel this instead of actual transmitted heat dissipation as from some heating source? The heat did not seem to emanate from the vicinity of where the UFO was, but seemed to be equally"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Shallow Canyon Wall,' •^ ' 4_— Hut isljffv^ I'i | c nl-'Sand & Creen Glass 'No - — -•• - . . ^ rth ^s\" Dirt Road uT (Drawing not to scale) • From Roac _^... 3 Witnesses '60 feet down. t he road 1969 UFO Landing Site present everywhere around them, as if it were just a hot summer day. Just outside of the circle at one spot on the side toward the road was a small pile of unusual looking sand. This was piled up in a typical conical pile as if someone had just gradually poured it there out of a container. It measured. roughly 8 to 10 inches across the base. It had not been there the day before. The Chapin's scooped most of the sand up into a fruit jar and took it back home with them. Two days later they discovered an unusual \"glob\" of heavy metal which was lying on the ground tailings about 8 feet away from the sand pile and about 2 feet outside of the depression ring. It had not been there the day before the UFO was sighted either. The reader should keep in mind that this all occurred on October 30, 1969, and we did not investigate until we heard about the case in the summer of 1977. The metal \"glob\" is about half the size of the average man's fist, rounded on top with stubby protrusions on the bottom. The object weighs about a pound. The rounded top appears to have been burned somewhat. We, thought of a possible meteorite explanation, but ruled that out after talking to astronomer consultant Tom Gates and others. The \"glob\" was resting gently on top of the ground as if placed or lightly dropped there. (See photos of sand and \"glob\".) Jane Chapin refused to handle the sand in her bare hands for some reason, but \" would hold the metal \"glob\". Analysis tests were run in two different highly equipped and qualified laboratories which cannot be named for security reasons: One testing lab is outside of California. The other was arranged for by Dr. Richard Haines here in California. One should keep in mind also that neither the sand nor the \"glob\" was seen by anyone as being physically dropped or somehow discarded out of the UFO. Both were simply discovered there after the craft departed, and were not there according to the witnesses the day before. It is interesting to speculate the reason for UFO interest around mining areas. Is it possible their frequent ' presence is due to the extraction of minerals from these areas for their own use or replenishment? It would be interesting to learn if this were the case. An interesting speculative theory of my own is to envision planet Earth as a likely oasis in the vasthess of space where travelers could replenish their needs of resources such as minerals, fuel, water, and food — a stop-over place to replenish what is needed for continued explorations farther out into space. We are already considering our own moon for just such a purpose. Reports of UFO activity around other mining areas of the country are not new. We have had similar reports from pther parts of the country, involving UFOs and, in some cases, occupants observed near or at old mine entrances. Speculative, of course, but wouldn't it be interesting if we had residue from a UFO mining extraction operation in our possession! A few additional comments regarding the UFO .landing site. The obvious spot where the craft had been sitting was right next to the creek which was 6 to 8 feet wide at that point. The tailings are gray and beige in color, a combination of gravel and dirt, very little sand. The stream itself is very rocky. The mining operation is mostly \"placer\". A shallow tunnel area only 4 feet into a rock wall is the only tunneling being done. There was no trail or exhaust from the disappearing craft. No paralyzing effects, numbness, or other physical effects were felt by the (Continued on next page) '"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"(Mining Case, Continued) witnesses; however, they commented they felt like they were \"glued\" to the spot where they were standing, as if they could not move. This could have been actual astonishment, a natural reaction in such a spectacular circumstance. Asked whether they reported the incident to any of the law enforcement agencies, the reply was \"no\". The sand and the \"glob,\" the Chapin's say, are completely foreign to the area. They have never seen anything like these two items in their 40 years of active mining in this vicinity. In my many visits with the Chapin's, the couple appear to be completely honest and sincere, so much so in fact that I was overly impressed. No way, in my estimation, could these fine people have fabricated such a story, especially with all the unusual features and the two material samples connected with it. The information and analysis reports were shared during the overall investigation by several local scientists and other investigators. Though doubting questions were asked, and should be, all seemed satisfied that the encounters were genuine. The second CE-II encounter occurred on December 29, 1976, at the same mine location only about 80 feet west of where the 1969 UFO had been sitting. This was down the road farther where the approach to the claim is, as you drive toward the mine. The time of day was approximately 11:00 AM on this cold morning with some ice on the dirt road. As the couple stopped and got out of their car, they again noticed some heat similar to the 1969 experience but not nearly as hot. Suspecting perhaps another UFO was there again as in 1969, they began cautiously looking around. Clint walked over to the wall area beyond the creek and Jane stood in the road by the car, her .38 pistol strapped to her belt where she usually carried it. Suddenly a yell came from Clint, \"Jane, bring the gun!\" 8 Jane and Clint Chapin The Metal \"Glob\": Drilled Spots Show Where Samples Were Taken for Analysis Side View Direction of Flight Flat Bottom December 1976 UFO at Redding, Calif., Mine Site"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"He had spotted the same or a very similar craft again, down stream in the brush. He no more than got the words out of his mouth when the craft rose rapidly into the air to an estimated height of about 90-100 feet and immediately hit them both with some sort of ray or force field. Asked if they recalled seeing a beam or flash of anything emanate from the craft at this point, the couple said \"no\". The hostile or perhaps defensive result was that they were both knocked down by whatever struck them. Clint was against the shallow rock wall of the opposite side of the canyon beyond the j creek and had struck his head against the wall as he fell. Jane was in the middle of the dusty and somewhat icy road near the car. She fell in the road on her hands and knees, injuring her leg. The barrel of her gun was plugged with mud. They both concluded that they were knocked unconscious for about 12 to 15 minutes. Jane made no bones about the fact, unembarrassed, that she struggled to her feet drenched in her own urine, cold and wet! There was no sign of the UFO anywhere. They did not see it leave under the circumstances of the attack. Completely exhausted and exasper- ated after this spectacular experience, they painfully got into the car and slowly drove home to Redding. As the craft rose up to its attacking altitude, both managed to get a pretty ^ good look at it for a second or two before it \"zapped\" them. It was about ~* the size, shape, and color of the 1969 vehicle, with the exception that this one seemed to have a pock-marked appearance to its surface, similar to the exterior of an orange. There was no time lapse except for the brief unconscious period and the UFO was too small for taking anyone aboard. It might be safe to say that this was no psychic phenomenon, no hallucination or ball lightning! These phenomena do not depress the ground, zap people, or appear to be intelligently controlled. Checking the area some days later where they believed the UFO had been, Sand and Green Glass Chips the Chapin's could find no evidence of a landing depression this time and it is assumed the craft may have been suspended slightly off the ground, which is common. This object was described as tan in color. There was a noticeable amount of heat again, but not as intense as in the first 1969 encounter. The UFO was estimated to have been about 175 to 200 feet away from Clint. It seems apparent that this UFO, as in the case of others investigated, may have a built-in defensive mechanism for self protection in the event of attack by human influence. The defensive mechanism may activate at the least sign of threatened hostility for self preservation of the craft being disabled to fall into human hands. Of course, remote control is not ruled out either. This was obviously exercised when Clint excitedly yelled for Jane to \"get the gun!\" Needless to say, the Chapin's are very angry and intent on revenge for what the device did to them. They went so far as to plant a dynamite trap with a weight tripping gadget in hopes of blowing up the UFO if it came back. They were encouraged by the local sheriff to abandon this idea and remove the explosives in case some innocent person or large animal might accidently trigger it off. The Chapin's tend to blame their present poor health on the UFO. They feel it is responsible for their health problems. Jane has a ruptured stomach membrane which she attributes to the incident. She lost 24 pounds from December to February. On October 13, 1977, the couple again experienced an indication of heat in the canyon at the mine site, saying they both got sick and vomited but did not see any UFO. One wonders how many more times this alien craft or similar ones had been frequenting this particular mining site or general immediate area between October 1969 and December 1976! A mysterious aspect has recently surfaced where the Chapin's said they were visited by some mysterious scientists who were highly interested in their experience and the mineral materials, asking that their identities not be disclosed. According to the Chapin's, they were flown out of the state to an extensive laboratory facility where they were medically examined and treated in conjunction with their UFO experience and the mineral samples examined as well. However, the couple would not say where they were taken or by whom. This does bring to mind a similar experience 9 (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"(Mining Case, Continued) involving a private pilot I interviewed in the late 1960's who was interrogated by a U.S. Air Force Major after a close encounter in the air, warning him to get to a military hospital if he had any after ill effects from possible radiation! (My special thanks for transcribing and clerical assistance on this case to Eleanor Sanini and Louise Canning.) Analysis Results The sand has been analyzed by Dr. Edward Zeller of the Radiation Physics Lab. at the University of Kansas Space Technology Center, as well as by associates of Dr. Richard Haines in Los Altos, California, who had analysis tests run, : on the metal \"glob\" particles also. An additional analysis was conducted on the metal particles by another high quality lab outside of California as mentioned before. The researchers did nof wish to disclose their identity publicly for security reasons. Assistance from three other local scientists added to the analysis investigations of the materials. These analysis reports are lengthy with comparisons, tables, micro-photos, charts, etc., and are not included herein, but copies are on file at MUFON and CUFOS. These may be published later if interest in the reports warrants it. The unusual greenish glass was analyzed using an x-ray EDAX (Nuclear Diodes Energy Dispersive Analyzer). The sample is made up primarily of relatively pure silicon, with just minor traces of potassium, chlorine, titanium, iron, and neodymium. The scientist who conducted the analysis made several suggestions and interesting comments: (1) These particles should be chemically analyzed (e.g., gas chromatography). (2) The panicles analyzed were considered to be considerably purer than glass. When asked how one might produce such purity he said, \".... in a vacuum or in space!\" He has analyzed lunar soil, the Murchison meteorite, and other space- 10 related material. Being experienced in analyzing unusual materials, he was somewhat surprised to find such purity in these samples. (3) Due to the very shallow depth nature of the scinterirtg (melting), he speculated that the energy applied to the particles would have had to be very great and very brief which rules out any origin that would be meteoritic in nature. The heating would have had to been very selective. Chemical analysis of the scintered green glass will be completed soon. Dr. Zeller stated that the sand was not naturally formed. He felt there was a geological process of common minerals, composite of rock fragments, and manufactured materials involved. The sand contained the usual quantities of quartz fragments, feldspar, pyrite and magnetite, silt stone, sulphide, and volcanic components, but no mica. Three other items of unusual interest are the flakes of metallic gold, the nearly white scintered silicate which adhered to the green glass fragments, and the unusually pure pale green glass itself. Metal Analysis The metal contained mostly copper, then tin, and lesser amounts of iron, chrome, silver, thorium, and a small amount of silicon. One lab report, only after a second analysis, showed no thorium. In essence, the main metals indicate the material may be brass. However, these minerals are alien to the Chapin mining claim minerals with the exception of silver and iron. How it got there, and why, is an unsolved mystery. The analysis of the metal chips was conducted by a skilled scientist in the metallurgic field using sophisticated laboratory analysis equipment and an electron microscope. Printouts of the x- ray fluorescence process and other details of the tests are in MUFON- CUFQS files, too lengthy to be included in the article. Samples of the metal were sent some years ago to the Division of Mines in Golden, Colorado, Miles Rambaugh Labs in Sacramento, the State mineralogist in San Francisco, Nevada State University Geology Department, and Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles. The Chapin's received no satisfaction from any of these sources as to the breakdown content or what the object was. The puzzling thing about the \"glob\" of metal is the variety of metals all molded into one mass. For what purpose? Alloys are common but usually consist of just two or more metals of more equal amounts, not as many or the odd combination this specimen has. Another odd thing about the metallic content of the \"glob\" was that the greater percentage of the mass was copper, yet the assay of the minerals extracted from the mining operation itself indicates only .05% copper. The Chapin's would not part with the metal specimen but did agree to have it drilled into to secure inner metallic chips for our analysis as had already been done to it in four places. The interior appears in all respects to resemble brass but it is quite hard to drill and the chips are quite brittle, unlike ordinary brass. The Chapins were afraid to tell those who examined the metal \"glob\" where or how they came by it for fear of ridicule! The \"glob\" appears to have been heavily plated in some sort of heavy plating bath as the exterior appears to be dull gunmetal colored."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"THE FORCE FARCE By Ted Peters (MUFON Consultant for Theology and Louisiana State Director) The rudiments of a new UFO theology are developing. I call it the \"Force Farce\". The term \"Force\" is gaining currency due to its prominent role in the unexpectedly popular science fiction movie, Star Wars. I apply the term \"farce\" to those who attempt to exploit this popularity by constructing a glamorous but flimsy religious program. One case in point is the December 1977 issue of Official UFO. The guest editorial plus three articles seek to propound such a religious vision. The guest editor is named Jack Crandall. He is identified twice as a philosopher, even though his name does not appear in the 1974-75 issue of The Directory of American Philosophers. The editorial writer says the Force is \"all things controlled by the universe\". It reminds me of the Hindu concept of Brahman, referring to the one undifferentiated and impersonal ground of all reality. Crandall goes on to depict the Force as -omnipresent and influencing each of our thoughts as well as using flying saucers, among other things, to carry messages. He says that to follow the Force is to become \"greater than before;\" to fail to \"believe\" in the Force is to become \"less\". The Force theology asserts that the universe is caught in a struggle between the Force and an anti-Force. The Force has enemies and, curiously enough, these enemies are those who criticize the magazine the philosopher Crandall is writing for: The Force stands on the side of the editors of Official UFO. (I presume this makes past- editor Dennis Hauck now an enemy of that which controls the entire universe. Not only has be roused the ire of the publishers of Official'UFO but even the gods are supposedly angry with him. Poor Dennis!) I would like to offer a word of caution to the priests of the new Force cult: whenever we presume that the divine supports our own view over against those we deem our enemies, then we have become not only fanatical but idolatrous. Rather than obeying the divine will, we have enlisted the divine into our own service. Three other articles in the same magazine also draw upon pur religious sensibilities: \"New UFO Religion Holds Key to Man's Salvation,\" by George S. Winslow; \"How to Tap the Force: Cosmic Power of the Space : Gods,\" by Andrew Trent; and \"Saved by a UFO,\" by Julie Riggs. The Trent article tries to prove the Force exists by citing alleged conversion experiences of UFO witnesses. This approach resembles the testimonial period during a Pentecostal faith-healing service. The Force is depicted as — what I have elsewhere termed — the \"celestial savior\". The Force can inspire persons to re-open their minds, fill them with energy to search out new goals and conquer them, halt a boring frame of thought, and introduce new and exciting ways of thinking. Wouldn't it be great to be able to get all these things from a UFO! One testimonial in the Trent article was taken from a Mrs. Barbara Koffman, allegedly a 31- year-old mother of three living in Cutoff, Louisiana. She describes her UFO experience in terms of a miraculous conversion, after which her previously \"miserable existence\" was replaced by happiness and success. This calls to mind the \"born-again\" experience of evangelical Christians. Mrs. Koffman and her husband are said to have begun a catering service 6 months after the UFO sighting, which has now become a whopping success. Well, the town of Cutoff does in fact exist and appears on some larger maps. On two occasions I tried calling her long distance. No number is listed for her, her husband, or any catering service associated with the Koffman name. My point here is not to render a criticism of a particular magazine. It is rather to show that this understanding of the Force is grounded in the fictions of Hollywood movies and New York publishing. It is not the result of a new revelation or spiritual insight. It is a self-serving religious concept, appealing to our less-than-noble desire to gain individual happiness and financial success. It does not call us to serve the will of God to show love to all mankind, a will that could on occasion . come into conflict with our own will and desires. It is strictly a \"gimmie- gimmie\" religious posture. To my knowledge the concept of the Force first appears in Perelandra, the science-fiction novel written by C.S. Lewis back in 1944. The Force theology there is (Continued on next page) 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"(Force Farce, Continued) unpacked by a Professor Weston, the antagonist who later in the book becomes the Devil himself. Weston is portrayed as a truly modern intellectual trying to marry up-to- date science with old-fashioned religion. He is sitting on a rock somewhere on the planet Venus explaining his views to the novel's hero, named Ransom: Call it a Force. A great, inscrutable Force, pouring into us from the dark bases of being. A Force that can choose its instruments....I'm being guided. I know now that I am the greatest scientist the world has yet produced. I've been made for a purpose. It is through me that Spirit itself is at thi moment pushing on to its goal. 1 i Like the editorial writer for Official UFO, Weston is very confident that he is a special vehicle of this transcendent power, a messenger from the Force. In Perelandra, however, what Weston does not know is that the Spirit using him is not God or anything like God. With disconcerting irony, author Lewis portrays Weston's conceit as a weakness that allows Satan himself to overcome his will and take possession of his soul. It is always dangerous to presume that the devine serves to edify me rather than the other way around. Elsewhere I have attempted to analyze the religious propensity inherent in the UFO phenomenon. 2 The rise of the Force theology is an example of the tendency to seek fullfillment of our deep inner religious needs through concepts appropriate to our scientific and technological mind- set. We have spiritual needs but a non- spiritual mentality, a mentality that understands electrical charges or radio beam transmission better than it understands worship or prayer. The religions of ancient mythology and the Bible see the devine power behind all things as essentially personal.

This may be the largest convention yet and time is short. Speakers include Ted Bloecher, Dick Hall, J. Allen Hynek, Donald E. Keyhoe, and Len Stringfield. There will also be workshops on special topics and a slide presentation on close encounter cases, revealing new details resulting from MUFON investigations. Ticket prices are morning - $3; afternoon - $4; Saturday evening - $4; and Sunday afternoon - $3, with a package price of $12 for all sessions.

The Force, in contrast, is the machine idolatrized. It is part and parcel of a post-Newtonian culture that believes everything to be run by the mechanical and mathematically reducible laws of nature. Our culture is thoroughly naturalistic and scientific. We think we must answer all life's questions in these terms. The Force appears to be such an answer. But it is not. The Force is a farce for three reasons. First, it is a fictional creation rather than a divine revelation. Second, it tends toward megalomania and fanaticism, i.e., believing that I am specially chosen and hence better than other people. Third, it fails to meet our deepest spiritual need, namely, the need to know that ultimately God is personal, and that he is thereby capable of loving us. REFERENCES 1. Lewis, C.

His paper on the subject was completed in April. Associate Editor Stringfield has told MUFON UFO JOURNAL that since then he has obtained additional data, which may result in some amendments to the original paper. His talk will present possible documentation, some of it quite surprising, that goes beyond merely verbal claims. The sensational nature of his presentation is sure to cause a lot of re-thinking, both by serious UFO researchers and casual observers.

Mr; Greenawald's most recent poll is edited here from a seventeen-page report, well worth the attention of all researchers. Shortage of space necessitates editing some interesting material — AD) The number of UFO researchers in the United States is estimated to be on the order of only 10,000 individuals. This means that only one out of approximately 20,000 persons is a student of the UFO phenomenon. It is small wonder that UFO witnesses have difficulty in finding a sympathetic ear. Ufologists are hard to find. Based on a poll of mostly Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) members, the nominal member of an objective and active UFO organization looks like this: male, 42 years old, a successful professional, college educated. He is Protestant, politically conservative, of Anglo-Celtic/German parentage, and has sporadic psychic capabilities. He has had more than one UFO sighting, believes that UFOs are of extraterrestrial origin, is convinced the U.S. Government is still studying. UFOs, and has been interested in UFO for 16 years. He spends 14 hours a week researching UFOs, doesn't care about anonymity, and is an {dependent type. From the above average \"profile,\" the following were thought to be unusual results of the poll and indicate areas of future study: COLLEGE EDUCATED: Not only were most of the UFO researchers college educated, but a significant percentage had advanced degrees. POLITICALLY CONSERVATIVE: Politically conservative people in this country are in the distinct minority, and to find them involved in this strange business most assuredly should be investigated by a sociologist. HAS HAD MORE THAN ONE UFO SIGHTING: Millions of people have reported UFOs, but few have developed sufficient interest to research them. Multiple sightings by more educated persons appear to arouse curiosity toward UFOs. BELEVES THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS STILL STUDYING UFOs: Maybe not surprising but definitely opposed to the opinion of the news media. During my early involvement with the UFO enigma, I assumed that there were NICAP and APRO members in almost every neighborhood. After several years of. stark loneliness, I realize that there were very few folks about who took an objective posture on this strange business. An estimate of the total number of members in the major UFO organizations in the United States is possible through a study of club publications over the past several years. The figure I arrived at was 10,000. I also estimated that the three most prestigious organizations — NICAP, ,MUFON, and APRO — equalled the membership of all the UFO groups scattered across the U.S. so that the total number is approximately 20,000. Bear in mind that this is the total number who have joined a UFO organization — not necessarily productive UFO researchers. Many of the aforementioned probably are members of more than one group and may have been counted more than once. Those could be offset by those UFO students who haven't bothered to join any UFO group — the independent researcher. Of this generous estimate of 20,000 members, I guessed that only half are productive — people who interview UFO witnesses, those who lecture on UFOs, teach classes about the subject, or those who write reports, articles, or books. This would leave .only about 10,000 individuals to \"advance the state of the art\". Last year, I mailed a questionnaire to approximately 150 members of MUFON whose names and addresses appeared in the MUFON publication (SKYLOOK and, later, MUFON UFO JOURNAL), 1974 through 1977. Names were chosen somewhat at random, and along with an introductory letter, four copies of the form were enclosed with a request to distribute them to other UFO types in the same, area. Forty-three (43) individuals responded. One nationally-known ufologist declined to fill out the questionnaire, writing back that he felt this was of sociological interest only and a waste of time. Some of the interesting comments from respondees ran thus: \"Ludicrous, it seems to me, has been the appearance of a wave of so-called 'UFOlogists,' who are so upset by being unable to pigeonhole all their facts in one neat little box, that they have given up in disgust and turned it all over to Demons, Elementals, and Evil Men in Black, etc., all of whom now are supposed to represent a unifying force which spends all its time deceiving us.\" Another wrote, \"I dispatch for the police department. My (Continued on next page) 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"(California Report, Continued) original thought in getting involved was to see that anybody having a sighting would have some place to report it...As far as where Ufology is going, I can't say, but I think the more data we gather for research, the better.\" And still another, \"With the four law logic that I developed, mind, life, matter, being, etc., can be precisely modelled in a scheme based on Everett's physics. Mechanisms for UFOs, angels, Sasquatches, Nessies, etc., then concretely emerge, and the phenomena can be understood and explained — as can telepathy, psychokinesis, etc.\" These sample comments from our researchers were quite varied as one might expect, indicating that we have a long way to go before any one theory becomes solidified. The wide divergence probably explains some of the mistrust of one researcher toward another. AGE AND GENDER: The average age of the group polled was 41.9 years. Henry McKay, the noted Canadian ufologist, conducted a similar poll at the 1976 CUFOS conference and the two polls are compared below. Age McKay Poll Greenawald Poll 21-30 31-40 41-50 51-60 61-70 8 15 18 6 5 52 10 11 11 9 2 43 Interestingly enough, McKay's most popular age group was the 41-50, whereas Greenawald's poll showed no significant difference between groups until the oldest one. McKay's poll no doubt reflects data from the top 10 percent of the UFO researchers in the United States, as to be able to attend Dr. Hynek's conference was indeed an honor. A ten to one ratio exists between the men and women involved in this 14 business. Why more of the fairer sex are not involved invites speculation. McKay Poll Greenawald Poll Female 3  3 Male 49  40 POLITICAL LEANINGS: A very surprising result was the large percentage of political conservatives in the UFO arena. Of the 43 persons responding, 12 were liberal, 20 conservative, 6 middle-of-the-road, and 5 termed themselves \"other\". It is estimated that for every conservative in the U.S. there are three liberals. This is based on recent surveys which show Republicans at about 25% of the national total. Thus, the number of conservatives in the UFO field, relatively speaking, is inordinately high. They outrank liberals by a factor of 5 to 1 when adjusting for the estimated national spread. Being a political ' conservative myself, I can only surmise that supporting one more unpopular cause doesn't seem to be too big an additional load to bear. Nevertheless, why would a political conservative become involved in the UFO enigma, where liberal social and technical thoughts seem to be the accepted patterns? ETHNIC BACKGROUND: I was interested in the country of origin of the respondees' parentage. Since most of the respondees did not appear to be worried about anonymity, I was able to trace most back to a last name. I got: Anglo and Celtic,* 29; German, 15; French, 5; Swedish, 2; Slovak, 2; and several other national origins, 1 each. The preponderance of the Anglo, Celtic, and German backgrounds may be an interesting study for one skilled in the statistics of immigration. Most likely, the British Isles, Ireland,* and Germany supplied the bulk of our fore- fathers to this country in the early years. UFO SIGHTINGS: The majority of those members of MUFON polled reported a UFO sighting, 58% of all respondees. However, 80% of those admitting to a sighting also, had seen more than one UFO. Apparently these events in many cases were instrumental in transforming an average person into the unique UFO researcher. ANONYMITY: No names were requested on the questionnaire. Regardless, about 90% of the UFO researchers did not seem to mind that they were associated with the UFO phenomena. One commented, \"Let everyone have the courage of his convictions, or get out of UFO research.\" RELIGIOUS BACKGROUND: Most of the researchers were from a Protestant background, 27 in all. Six were Catholic, and 3 were Jewish; the others (1 each) listed various other denominations, plus \"atheist,\" \"agnostic,\" and \"none\". Those who were religious were still active in church activities. No importance was attached to the above as it probably reflects the national average. CURIOSITY AND COOPERATION: A surprising result was that only 14 of 43 respondees (33%) gambled 39$ in stamps for a free copy of the report. I could find little evidence that any of the respondees from MUFON passed the additional forms provided them to nearby colleagues. This strengthens my opinion that the existence of the average UFO researcher is a lonely one. There are few of us, and we are spread out over a large country. We apparently don't communicate much with one another, especially with those that we don't know. Our nominal UFO researcher seems a bit wary of and not too cooperative with his colleagues. GOVERNMENT STUDYING UFOs?: \"Do you think the U.S. Government is still studying UFOs?\" The answer to ,*Mr. Greenawald includes \"Anglo\" with \"Celtic\" and Ireland with the British Isles, but in good conscience I cannot do this. I feel the categories and national boundaries must be separated; and have taken the liberty of editing the text in this way. — AD."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"that was a resounding yes! from most respondees. SOURCE OF UFOs: I wondered how much of an impetus the interdimen- sional hypothesis has received. From the answers, it seems not much. The ETH received 38 votes; the interdimen- sional 8; the paraphysical 3 votes, and those who expressed no opinion, 3. Some respondees think UFOs come from more than one \"source\". UFO ORGANIZATIONS AND PUBLICATIONS: From a careful statistical study, it is evident that the individual respondees from MUFON support other UFO organizations and publications. However, surprisingly only a few subscribed to the FLYING SAUCER REVIEW which, in my opinion, is one of the finest publications of its kind. STANDARD OF LIVING: Of the 60% who responded regarding financial income, the average seemed to be at the high end of the $11,000-$20,000 per year bracket. This figure is probably close to the upper middle class in the U.S. I would guess this results from the relatively high average educational level. Educationally, the following was noted: 70% had college degrees, 12% had some college, and the remaining 18% no college training. Of those who attained the bachelor's degree, 19 continued their intellectual pursuits for MA's and PhD's. This seems a remarkably high level of education for an area popularly assumed to be on the fringes of the occult. HAVE YOUR EFFORTS EVER BEEN UNDER SURVEILLANCE? To this question, 36 answered \"no,\" 5 answered \"yes,\" and 2 thought that it was \"possible\". WHAT PROMPTED YOUR INTER- EST DM UFOs? Personal sightings headed the list in this category, with 13 responses. Curiosity received 10 responses, and media coverage accounted for 9. Sightings of others was cited by 8 respondees, and various other reasons accounted for the rest. BOOK REPORT By Barbara Mathey A Plunge into Hyperspacc (Mergulho no Hiperespaco) by A. Moacyr Uchoa — Esoteric Dimensions of Flying Saucer Research. No publisher indicated, privately printed? (General Uchoa sent us a copy as a friendly gesture, with no explanation.) About the author: in September 1975, when my husband and I traveled with Dr. and Mrs. J. Allen Hynek in Brazil, we had the pleasure of making the acquaintance of General Uchoa, a kindly man of ebullient temperment and operatic personality. Besides being a civil engineer, he is Chief Professor of Logical Physics in the Military Academy of Agulhas Negras, and also teaches at the Superior School of War. He is a successful man of his world (i.e., Brazil), and guided the Hynek entourage easily and joyfully through a maze of politicians, bureaucrats, schedules, airports, universities, crowds, the press, television, social affairs, speeches, interpreters, and red tape: A delightful dinner party was given in honor of the Hynek's by the General and his lovely wife at their apartment in Brasilia, where we enjoyed speaking English with his attractive, intelligent daughters, and listening in fascinated amusement as two couples described observing a UFO from a bus (which was full of passengers). The Brazilian culture is different than that of the United States. The people are more relaxed. Magic, A personal sighting was apparently the major influence in developing a student of the UFO phenomena. This happened to me. What I saw I can't explain. Whatever it was, it certainly aroused my curiosity! In conclusion^ I invite any UFO investigator desiring to pursue the areas suggested by this report to contact me personally: Walt Greenawald, 20709 Collins St., Woodland Hills, CA 91367.

The Brazilian UFO researchers are more mystic and more Jungian than the American. Spiritism is the religion of many intellectuals. These personal comments are introduced to show that the General, the contents of his book notwith standing, is not a \"nut\". The preface is by Professor Flavio Pereira, Director of the School of Space Sciences at Sao Paulo, President of the Brazilian Institute of Aeronautics and Space Sciences, President of the Brazilian Committee of Confidential Investigation of UFOs, and author of The Red Book of Flying Saucers. Professor Pereira mentions meetings of Brazilian UFO groups, including the ones at which Dr. Hynek spoke. He remarks on books about UFOs, some by Brazilians, some translations (Ruppelt, Hynek, Vallee). He goes on to say that the paranormal is here, that the center of gravity of Ufology is shifting. Ufology now includes not . only parapsychology but also esoteric philosophy. General Uchoa's book is timely, and he hopes there will be English and French translations soon. In the preamble the General states his high spiritual ideals. He criticizes and analyses the narrow-mindedness of scientists. They decide summarily what is impossible. Intelligent life in our solar system is impossible, according to them, as are trips from outside our solar system. As for UFOs — absurd! They don't exist! Also our idea of space-time limits our knowledge. With his book he is going to try to wake us up, to make us realize that if we can exceed our normal sense limitations we can have a new life in a cosmic apprenticeship. After attacking academic science, which is material and gives us the power 15 (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"(Book Report, Continued) to destroy ourselves, the General describes esoteric and spiritual science. In it, time becomes a dimension. Instead of three dimensions there are four. After a discussion of UFO research on the levels of ordinary and advanced science, he comes to the esoteric-spiritual level, and the heart of the matter appears. This is his research, together with a small group of friends, on farms near Brasilia, from July 1968 to February 1969. First, a being called Yogarim appeared to the General alone at 1:30 AM at a deserted spot not far from the farmhouse. The being told the General he had a mission: to observe, to investigate, to write a book. He would be protected by Yogarim, who resembled the portrait of the Master Morya of the White Brotherhood of the Himalayas. It was the Master and his brother Kut-Humi who instructed Madame Helena Blavatsky, the founder of Theosophism. Those readers who are not sympathetic may stop here. There follows an account of the group seeing various lights, demanding and receiving proofs that the beings will communicate with them, and the General \"hearing\" messages. The General is either able to hypnotize himself at will, or allows himself to be put into a trance state by these beings. As far as I can tell, it is the latter that happens throughout the period of research. The rest of the book is an account of what the General experiences when in trance. He has a meeting with Yasha- Avi, a personage of high degree. He describes the nature of hyperspaceand hypertime, which will lead to a revolution in the world of science. The telepathic communications between the beings and the General remind me somewhat of the Seth books by Jane Roberts, and of parts of Uri by Andrija Puharich. The beings work to bring goodwill, love, and peace to mankind. We are reminded that \"many are called, 16 but few are chosen\". The General watches a screen, on which the beings can see anybody or any group they wish. They can \"pick up\" on our mental and emotional \"waves,\" and can influence us mentally and emotionally. They state firmly that drugs are bad. The author observes unisex beings, and meets a Christ-like figure called Yashamil. He goes to a \"harbor,\" where spaceships of different shapes are moored together. They are fueled by solar energy. He goes aboard a spaceship of .rare beauty, and listens to a Commander Zyaish. There is a screen which projects images and sounds of distant planets. The Commander explains how the ship works, the method of propulsion. Zyaish says there are many different types of beings who visit Earth, and some wish to dominate us. On a sort of TV the General observes a city on another planet; he can see the people and they are happy and gay. He has conversations with the great Yashamil, asking him if our way of suffering is the only way to evolve, or if there are other ways, more noble and happy. Yashamil replies that suffering is not the only way for all the different types of humanity, but, sadly, it is the way for us. The ways of spiritual progress for all the different types of humanity are as infinitely multiple and flexible as are the ways of destiny of each individual human being. These beings can influence us mentally, and in their efforts to bring about love among men they are nearer to us than we realize. The beings use light, as a weapon and as an aid to health. They can materialize and dematerialize objects, but this is difficult. They use energy from stellar radiation. The General ends by exhorting his readers to support with courage this new and fascinating reality.

The pilots were standing at the landing strip at Koping airfield, when the object, estimated to be 10-15 meters long, could be seen at a distance estimated to be 2000 meters on a course toward NNE. Its altitude was estimated to be 100 meters, and it dropped to yet lower height over free ground with no obstacles. No sound was heard. The speed was estimated to be 400-500 kilometers/hour, and this \"estimate has been confirmed by military observations. The weather was clear at the time. One of the observers thought that the object resembled a \"flying barrel,\" an older • and now obsolete military aircraft, but the other one could see no likeness to an aircraft, as no wings or protruding details were evident. ; Conclusions are better held in abeyance, pending further investiga- tion. My initial reaction was that we had been visited by a vehicle with the same capabilities as the \"cruise missile,\" but that in this case its famous orientation capacity must have been considerably diminished. We'll see if there are any further developments on this case. On December 12, 1975, at 11:10 PM in the county of Tuusulans, in a direction toward Rusut lake, four youths saw a brilliantly lit, silent UFO with a length estimated from 8 to 10 meters appear only 50 meters away at an altitude of 50 meters, barely clearing the treetops. A row of square windows lined the fuselage, emitting a yellow light. Centrally located, between the middle windows, a field of bluish light was seen. Above and below the windows were brilliant circular lights, which were blinking on and off — sometimes four, sometimes six of them. The UFO had passed, when one of the youths started to blink with the headlights. Immediately the UFO stopped, turned and started toward the car and the youths. This obviously scared them, since they quickly got into the car and prepared to remove themselves from the place. The UFO, however, did not approach any closer than about 100 meters. Shortly afterwards, the UFO disappeared at high speed toward the nearby city of Helsingfors. In my letter of November 29,1977, I reported a series of incidents on January 8,1977, centered at the town of Nykoping (see January issue, No. 122). The events received quite extensive coverage from the press, both locally and nationwide. Probably as a result of the good coverage, several additional witnesses have come forward, which has prompted the local UFO-group to make a more thorough investigation. I skip the details and concentrate on their summary. Over 50 witnesses have related their experiences. The observations took place on January 8, 1977, from 2:30 to 3:55 PM and can be pin-pointed to the southern area of Nykoping, especially Hemgardsorriradet. The number of objects involved -varied between five and six. At the same occasion, one or two aircraft appeared on the scene. Characteristics: Glowing red color, shifting from red to white to yellow. Size varying; one of the smaller objects was spherical, others pencil-like, yet others had the classical saucer shape. In two cases cupola-shaped superstructures could be seen. No sound was heard in any of the sightings. The movements of the objects were described as jerky, with sudden changes in course, coupled with long periods of stationary position in mid-air. Sudden disappearances occurred in half of the reports. Observation times are quite long, upwards of l l / 2 hours. Military activity: Three witnesses saw military aircraft in the area. At least one of these has been identified as an advanced interceptor. Military sources generally deny such activities, but express interest in the results of the investigations. Witnesses: Estimated \"reliability\" varies, but the most interesting details have been given by persons with-the highest \"credibility ratings\". General: Observation conditions were excellent, with clear and cold weather. The sun set at 4:15 whence observations were made during the daylight period. There have been no reports of radio interference. No unusual animal behavior has been observed. MUFON 103 OLDTOWNE RD.

March and reported May 25 shows that 57% of Americans believe UFOs are \"real\" rather than imaginary, an increase of 11% since 1966. Among adults polled, 93% were aware of the subject and 9% of them claimed to have sighted a UFO. The conviction that UFOs are real is considerable higher in the West and Midwest than in the East and South, very high in people under 30 (70%), and higher with increasing educational background (college, 66%). I Mark R. Herbstritt Astronomy Notes THE SKY FOR JUNE 1978 Mercury — It is too close to the sun to be easily visible, being in superior conjunction on the 14th. Venus — It is about 26 degrees above the western horizon at sunset and sets about 2% hours later. Mars — In Leo, it is well up in the southwest at sunset and sets about 4 hours later. It is 0.1 degree south of Saturn on the 4th and 0.8 degree north of Regulus on the 12th. Jupiter — In Gemini, it is very low in the west at sunset and sets about 1% hours later.

Seemingly a very simple question. We know that reports of unidentified (to the observer) objects in the sky and on the ground are received by our organization. Most of them are explainable in conventional terms, but a small residue remains. This residue contains some quite provocative accounts which on face value do not fit into the scheme of things. As an organization we do not go beyond a statement that \"after an intelligent and commpnsense investigation of reports made to us, there exists a residue which does not appear to be due to natural or conventional causes.\" As you can see this is far from acceptance of any hypotheses which are put forward from time to time. This attitude is reflected in the type of items this newsletter carries. If it is concerning a report then the details as given to us are provided, together with however much comment we can give on checkable facts plus our conclusions if we have arrived at any. It should be remembered that investigation of reports takes time. We do not and will not react to media requests for \"instant\" answers. Where a newspaper article is printed we will try and provide you with follow up details where we are able to get them. Factual articles are based on investigation material wherever possible, and speculative ones should clearly indicate their nature. So, to answer the question posed of us, there is not enough good scientific evidence to suggest that UFOs are or are not anything more than 100 percent conventional stimuli at the moment. Scientists ridicule the subject without checking into it, and some UFO clubs make outrageous claims without substantiation. These are two extremes. UFO Research (S.A.) Inc., is in the middle and says let's check out all these accounts to the best of our ability to either prove or disprove — but let's use scientific method and let's do it now. Do you believe in UFOs? To this, the organization answers that we do not \"believe\" in anything, as belief conjures up a vision of blind acceptance, or acceptance based on the evidence. So far there is neither. (Director's Message, Contined from backcover) upsurge in reports during the first quarter of 1978 that could be attributed to hoax reports. However, a very gratifying, exciting, and positive action was inspired by the motion picture (CE3K) and the Jack Webb TV program \"Project UFO.\" We are now receiving a very significant number of older reports from reputable citizens who are coming forward to relate their experiences, which they previously only shared .with their immediate families. The fear of ridicule and anticipated damage to their personal respectability in their jobs and communities had prompted these people to refrain from making their sightings public. After viewing the current films and TV programs, they have realized that what they had personally considered such an unusual event that \"no one would ever believe it\" has been occurring to others throughout the past 25 years. U.S. Air Force, CIA and governmental agencies' public statements have also been a deterrent to citizens' disclosures on UFO sightings. In spite of the official government negative philosophy on UFOs, the intelligent populace has been able to disperse the proverbial \"fear smoke screen,\" evaluate the facts, and accept the UFO phenomenon as a truly scientific dilemma that must be resolved. And, yes, this same enlightened populace is coming forward to volunteer their services to MUFON to intelligently attack a problem which may be considered \"the greatest mystery of our time.\""},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Lucius Parish In Others' Words The March 21 issue of NATIONAL ENQUIRER reported on a UFO seen by policemen and others in Simi Valley, California, in August, 1977. Photographs of the object have now been \"mislaid,\" according to a spokesman for the police department. The March 28 ENQUIRER quotes former astronaut Gordon Cooper as saying that he saw \"hundreds\" of UFOs while stationed in West Germany as a test pilot in the early 1950's. According to Cooper, formation flights of UFOs appeared at high altitudes over Neubiberg Air Base for two days. Jets attempted to intercept them, but were unable to climb above 45,000 feet. A second article in this issue reports on the impact (or lack of it) of \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind,\" insofar as public reports of UFO experiences are concerned. There has been no CE3K-inspired flap (in the United States, at least), despite the predictions of same by various super-skeptics. The April issue of SCIENCE DIGEST has an article by Don Berliner, commenting on some of the humanoid encounters from the Project Blue Book files, including a couple of interesting cases which have received little publicity thus far.  , UFO REPORT for May has an excellent article by Wendelle C. Stevens on his investigation of the Eduard Meier contact story in Switzerland. Meier has produced numerous photos and films to back up his story of contact with beings who claim to be from a planetary system in the Pleiades. This issue also has a report of \"phantom aircraft\" by Curt Sutherly & David Fideler, plus John Keel on \"skyquakes\" and other articles. A new magazine specializing in both science-fact and science-fiction is FUTURE, a companion publication to STARLOG (mentioned in a previous column). FUTURE is published eight times a year and the May (#2) issue has an interview with Dr. Hynek, as well as features on the search for intelligent life in space, the debate over planetary explorations by manned expeditions or robot probes, and many other items of interest. Both FUTURE and STARLOG are highly recommended. Again, it is Wendelle Stevens to the rescue, saving the #9 issue of TRUE FLYING SAUCERS & UFOs from a terminal attack of \"rehash-itis.\" Stevens' article on capsule-shaped saucers is up to his usual standards and is accompanied by a number of UFO photos depicting this particular type of object. The #2 issue of IDEAL'S UFO MAGAZINE is now available. If you happen to pick it up and notice my letter to the editor with kind words for the #1 issue, be advised that some editing has taken place! My remarks about the initial offering were not all complimentary and I share the same reservations with respect to the current issue. Too much of the material originates with Richard Draper, Ronald Drucker or a variety of other suspected pseudonyms for the same writer. In short, do not accept any of the magazine's contents as genuine unless they can be verified by other sources. IDEAL's presentation of material is far more conservative than some of its competitors (whom we need not name), but conservative fiction is really no more palatable than outlandish fiction. During the period of 1962 to 1967, a somewhat unique publication was available to those interested in UFOs. C.A. Honey, an associate of the late George Adamski, produced the SCIENCE PUBLICATIONS NEWS- LETTER (originally COSMIC SCIENCE NEWSLETTER), which considered the UFO subject from a contactee viewpoint. There have been other such publications, but Honey's was certainly one of the best. He attempted to approach the topic objectively, as befits an engineer for Hughes Aircraft Company (which he still is). The SPN issues were also made available in Yearbook form and copies of those (excluding the 1963 volume) are still available. Those interested in more information may write to Honey at P.O. Box 2431, Fullerton, CA 92633. The PBS \"Nova\" program recently presented yet another critique of von Daniken's writings and theories, \"The Case of the Ancient Astronauts.\" As with most such efforts, the biases were all too evident.

Principal speakers were George D. Fawcett, Lincolnton, NC, MUFON State Director; Dan Duke, Boone, NC, MUFON State Section Director; P. Wayne LaPorte, Matthews, NC, State Section Director; Nolie L. Bell, Winston Salem, President of the Tarheel UFO Study Group and MUFON State Section Director; Dr. T. A. Guiton, Jamestown, NC, hospital administrator, teacher, psychologist and professional hypnotherapist; and Henry H. Morton, Wadesboro, NC, master of ceremonies and MUFON Field Investigator. Commendations must be extended to Ray Rhein, the Committee Chairman, who was instrumental in organizing this outstanding event. MUFON has cooperated with Ray to help make this another successful training meeting by supplying visual aids, door prizes, and literature. A major reassignment of responsibilities in Illinois that was not given exposure in this column, should be announced at this time. Mr. Leonard W. Sturm, 1835 South Fairview Avenue, Decatur, IL 62521; telephone (217) 428-7182, formerly a State Section Director, has replaced Robert Smulling as State Director for Illinois. Mr. Smulling is now the State Section Director for Hancock, Henderson, and McDonough counties. Bob resides at 8th and Broadway in Hamilton, IL 62341. Both Bob and Leonard are founding members of MUFON, each with years of experience in UFOlogy, Bob as a professional photographer and Leonard as an electrical engineer with Illinois Power. Mrs. Idabel E. Epperson, State Director for Southern California, has selected Willard D. Nelson, 18302 Montana Circle, Villa Park, CA 92667; telephone (714) 538-9467, to become the new State Section Director for Orange County to replace Alvin H. Lawson, Ph.D., who resigned in order to devote more of his time to personal UFO research. Dr. Lawson, a speaker at the 1977 MUFON UFO Symposium in Scottsdale, AZ, has concentrated his research, with Dr. McCall, in the areas of hypnotic regression of abductees and \"imaginary\" abductees to test the validity of this process as a tool in reconstructing events and experiences, during time lapses of \"real\" abductees. Willard, an aircraft structural research engineer, was formerly a MUFON Research Specialist. A name that many of you are seeing in correspondence with our MUFON Administrative Office is that of Mrs. Virginia Castner, our Office Secretary. She was also responsible for the typing of the speeches in the 1977 MUFON UFO SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS, and is now very involved with the 1978 proceedings in the same capacity. Virginia, a very competent and sincere secretary, her husband John, and daughter Becky have moved into a new home in Seguin, where they have adequate land to ride and train quarter horses. When Richard H. Hall became Editor of the MUFON UFO JOURNAL with the January 1978 issue, this heavy responsibility made it necessary for MUFON to seek a new International Coordinator to fill Richard's previous Board of Directors position. At the present time Richard is serving in a dual role, however he does not have adequate time to handle the essential correspondence with MUFON's foreign representatives and national directors, while also editing the JOURNAL. Volunteers will be solicited from our membership, who express an interest in serving in this important position. Please contact your International Director in Seguin, Texas, if you desire to volunteer your services. The 1978 MUFON SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS will be available at the Symposium in Dayton, Ohio, on July 29, 1978, to attendees and to all others on August 1st for $6.00 in the United States and $7.00 in all other countries postpaid. The difference in price is due to the monetary exchange rate and increased postal costs. The following MUFON Proceedings from previous symposiums may still be secured by ordering from MUFON, 103 Oldtowne Road, Seguin, Texas 78155, U.S.A., for the following amounts postpaid: 1973 - $3.25, 1975 - $4.00, 1976 - $5.00, and 1977 - $5.00. In 1977 at least four major UFO Conferences? or symposiums vied for the attention and participation of people interested in UFOlogy. Since it was not financially feasible for a person to attend each one of them, the participants were divided to such an extent that each conference suffered financial losses of various degrees. We are therefore elated that MUFON is the only major organization sponsoring a symposium of this nature in 1978 and expect the largest attendance of our 9 year history for this prestigious UFO Conference. Newspaper and magazine writers are presently involved in follow-up stories to previously published predictions that a rash of hoax UFO sighting reports would be motivated by the motion picture epic \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind.\" UFO debunkers, led by Philip Klass, received unwarranted news coverage for their forecasts, which did not materialize, much to their dismay. Actually, MUFON statistics indicate that 1977 was a slow year with no appreciable (Continued on page 18)"}]
