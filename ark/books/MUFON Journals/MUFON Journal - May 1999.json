A security network of four sur- veillance cameras at a factory shows a man leaving a work area, followed by a blinding flash of light, a power surge and disruption in all four cameras, and then a re- turn to normal surveillance on all four video screens. Approximately two hours later on the same night, the film depicts another power disruption followed by the sudden reappearance of the same man who had vanished two hours earlier. Down on his hands and knees, he vomits, stumbles to his feet and staggers off into the darkness. My first reaction was, \"That was weird, but it sure does not prove anything.\" Was this a clever hoax? Had someone used a computer to fabricate unusual imag- ery? Was it simply an unexpected pair of power surges and lightning flashes related to an electrical storm? It would be much easier to pass it off as \"simply weird\" and look forward to an upcoming and more en- tertaining commercial. The program announcer had already indicated that not only was the identity of the worker unknown, but the location of this factory and the identity of the secu- rity man were also unknown. With literally no leads to pursue, this peculiar video clip hardly seemed worth much time or consideration. And so, it was stored on a shelf for nearly two more years. Usually, an abduction researcher gathers an ab- duction account from perplexed participants and has no particular hard evidence to substantiate their recol- lections. In this particular situation, could we have photographic evidence of an abduction-but no partici- pant desiring help or making any claims? What kept intriguing me was the simultaneous dis- appearance and reappearance of this man with flashes of light-and his obvious nausea and vomiting. How could this be just a coincidence? What had happened About the Author A psychiatric therapist, John Carpenter holds the B.A. in Psychology from DePauw and Masters in Social Work from Washington University. He has been involved with ufology for more than 30 years, and has worked closely with more than 100 cases-often with the use of hypnotherapy. John has presented his findings at conferences from Australia to England, as well as in the U.S., including the MUFON International Symposium at Grand Rapids, MI, in 1997. He has also appeared on such programs as \"Sightings\" and \"Encounters.\" He presented six papers to the M.I.T. Abduction Study in 1992, and has produced research videos. He formerly wrote \"Abduction Notes\" for the Mutual UFO Journal, and is MUFON's Director of Abduction Research. (StarmanJC@AOL.com) to him? What did cause the electrical disturbances? Was there really anything we could learn from this brief video clip? Yes, there was. Frame by frame analysis I had shown this curious video segment a few times at research conferences, and I began to see more detail on the big screen. I decided to perform a frame by frame analysis, simply to get a better look at this film once and for all. I was stunned by the eerie scene which was revealed by viewing the film 1/30 of a second at a time (There are 30 frames produced per second on a video- tape). It now became much more evident in this stop-action mode what was occurring. I was able to conclude that an external light source had targeted this man from the air and most likely had directly caused the electrical distur- bances. Another eerie light causes a power outage one hour and fifty minutes later and clearly deposits the man (in a fetal position) in just l/4th of a second. Also, for the first time ever, I was able to read 80% of the security man's letter to the television program through this frame-by-frame analysis, because they had flashed it on the screen briefly during the segment. Now I had much more information to work with! The four security camera views form a quadrant of four video screens which seem to cover four entrances/ exits of the factory. The top left screen depicts a dimly-lit close-up of a closed door. The top right screen covers a back fence and gate which opens most likely into a paved parking lot or unloading zone. The bottom left screen displays a wall of shelves with boxes and a door at the far end. The bottom right screen reveals another entryway - perhaps the main front entrance. 11:16:03 PM The worker appears in the top right"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 May 1999 MUFON UFO Journal video screen, moving from right to left and opening the back gate to go out back into the darkness. There is a shiny metal sign hanging on the gate reflecting inside lights. (#1, #2) 11:16:08 PM The worker disappears into the dark- ness out back. 11:16:09 PM One frame (1/30 sec.) clearly shows a brilliant circular light focused on this worker and illuminating the surrounding area (Images #3). The man seems transfixed or gazing at something directly to his left and does not appear to be walking as he had been just moments earlier (It bears an eerie.resemblance to the famous Fire in the Sky poster which depicts Travis Walton struck by a beam of intense light.). The man stands facing his left in the central, but forward, portion of the bright circle of light on the ground. It simply appears as if someone has shined a huge flashlight down from the sky at him! Just one frame (another 1/30 of a sec.) later, the light has intensified greatly with the worker still transfixed at the center of it. (#4) The brilliance of the light is illuminating the entire back area and casting distinct shadows through the back gate and into the factory. These shadows will figure significantly into later ana- lytical calculations. The reflective metal sign on the gate appears to melt into the brilliance of the light outside; however, the shadow of that sign can be seen on the inside floor of the factory. The other three cameras are still operating normally. In the very next frame (1/3Oth sec.) the en- tire screen has gone white. (#5) The top left video screen has gone black, indicating that this camera has now malfunctioned. It also sug- gests that this camera may be the next closest in prox- imity to the brilliant light outside. The remaining two views at the bottom of the quadrant of four screens still appear normal. However, in the next few frames the bottom two video screens display electrical inter- ference and camera malfunctions. (#6) 11:16:11 PM Within a few seconds all four sur- veillance views appear normal again. There are no more electrical disturbances. The man does not reappear and is not seen again for the next 1 hour and 50 minutes. 01:06:28 AM All four video cameras record dark screens for no apparent reason. A power outage caus- ing all the lights to go off in the factory has occurred. This is confirmed by the fact that the camera in the upper right quadrant will continue to record some ee- rie things occurring in the darkened plant in the next three seconds. (#8) 01:06:29 AM The top right video screen shows (in 11:16:09 PM: Images #3 shows momentary circle of light around worker. two frames or 1/15 sec.) an eerie oval of light hitting the ground just outside the back gate (Image #7, Page 5). One can see the silhouette of the metal sign on the gate and the gate itself in from of the bright oval of light on the ground. This \"puddle of light\" is much different in that it does not illuminate the surrounding area like the ear- lier blast of brilliant light. In fact, there does not even seem to be a beam of light in the air at all-just this \"detached puddle of light\" on the ground. It is quite significant that the man does not appear in this circu- lar light yet. 01:06:29-30 AM All four video screens remain dark as the lights remain off in the factory. The upper right screen displays a darker after-image or negative im- age of the brief burst of the \"light puddle\" just outside the gate. This is significant because it proves that a bright light source wa.s indeed viewed by a video cam- era in darkness, creating a \"burned-in\" after-image on the video camera lens-and not likely created by com- puter trickery! 01:06:31 AM In just several frames (#9, # W) a second brief, but very distinct \"puddle of light\" ap- pears in the exact same location outside the back gate as did the first oval of light just two seconds earlier. This brief light appears to increase in size, radiating outward from its center quickly. The greatest signifi- cance is the reappearance of the worker in a crouched, face-down, fetal position in the direct center of this"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal May 1999 PageS 1:06:29 Images #7: Top right screen shows oval of light, with the silhouette of the metal sign on the gate itself in front of the bright oval light on the ground. small, self-contained light. Again, this light does not appear to illuminate anything else and seems detached from any illumination in the air. Again, one can see the silhouette of the sign and the gate quite easily just above and to the right of the crouched man. It is also important to note that the lights are com- ing back on in the areas of the factory that the bottom two cameras survey. The \"puddle of light\" vanishes in the next frames in just a split second before the lights come back on in the top quadrant camera views. 01:06:32 AM The top left screen is still dark, but the top right view displays the lights are back on with the sign on the gate again reflecting these lights (# 12). The man is kneeling with the top half of his body ob- scured by the sign on the gate. The bottom two camera views appear normal again. 01:06:35 AM The worker lurches forward on his hands and knees (#13) and begins to vomit a rather large amount over the next few seconds (# 14). Be- cause of light angles, the projected amount is reflec- tive and easy to see. Then he staggers to his feet and slowly wanders off into the darkness again. Later, I was to learn that the security man actually went to talk to this worker at this point in time out of concern for him. A frame-by-frame examination of the letter sent with 01:06:35 Images # 14: Worker on hands and knees vomiting. this videotape from the security man to the television program revealed many more interesting details. Only by enlarging the writing in the brief moments that this letter appears in the video segment was I able to even know what he had written. Approximately 80% of the letter was able to be deciphered in this manner-mostly because his handwriting was difficult to read. Here are some key excerpts: \"I work security at a factory in Florida and feel our cameras got something strange ... this worker ... going out back to check on something when the cameras went nuts ... big flash of light-then I couldn't find the guy. A couple of hours go by, another flash-cameras go nuts again. He is on all fours puking his guts up. I go down to talk to him, but he's acting all weird and scared and like he can't remember anything. He calls it quits for the night, then calls in sick for the next three days, and we never see the guy again. I showed the tape to my boss ... feared ridicule ... not use my name ... think I crazy ... probably lose my job ... will not sign my name...\" Several key parts of this letter add significance to this case. First of all, the security man admits he ob- served this disappearance as it happened and that he \"couldn't find the guy\" for a \"couple of hours.\" Not only can we not see him in the video footage for two hours, but the security man could not find him at the factory for the next two hours either. This documented absence is an important aspect of any credible abduc- tion case."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Page 6 May 1999 MUFON UFO Journal Secondly, the security man tells of \"going down to talk to him\" after his return and subsequent vomiting. Describing the worker's reactions following the pe- riod of missing time is very important: \"he's acting all weird and scared and like he can't remember anything.\" This is a commonly reported set of behaviors fol- lowing credible abduction accounts. Amnesia, disori- entation, nausea, fear, and confusion are all frequently reported. Thirdly, the man then goes home \"sick\" from his shift, but also \"calls in sick for the next three days\"- which strongly suggests a very strong emotional reac- tion or trauma resulting from his experience. The fact that they \"never see the guy again\" further suggests that the worker simply could not return to the factory and work there again without perhaps suffering flash- backs or reminders of his upsetting experience. These reported behaviors are classic symptoms of a Post Traumatic Stress Disorder-which is the most fre- quently experienced set of psychological symptoms that abductees have been reporting for years. Last of all, it is significant that both the security man and his boss agree to keep things anonymous for \"fear of ridicule.\" This strongly implies that they believe something very unusual and perhaps incredible oc- curred, and they are afraid of not being believed if they were to come forth openly. They obviously thought they had something important captured on the security videotape! Analysis by William Schneid William H. Schneid has a Ph.D. in criminology and psychology and was interviewed by Paranormal Bor- derline for this television episode to comment on the authenticity of the security film footage. As an expert on security systems he works as an investigative re- search analyst, both creating and \"cracking\" security systems. After carefully studying the footage, he concludes that the security film \"does appear to be authentic video.\" He further casts doubt that this is any kind of a hoax when he adds, \"I think if someone was to create this type of thing, it would have been much more pro- fessionally done.\" He does not claim to understand what is occurring in the film. Analysis by Ted Phillips Ted Phillips, research assistant to Dr. J. Allen Hynek for two decades, is the UFO researcher known world- wide for his expertise in thousands of physical trace cases. He is also an expert in astronomy and photogra- phy. He performed his own independent frame by frame analysis of this video footage and found all of the same fascinating details that I had uncovered. Ted concurs that \"a figure is seen standing at the forward edge of a light\" and that \"the figure is seen in two frames, and 1/30 of a second later the camera fails.\" He was very surprised that he \"can detect no shadow in the light\" on the ground \"from the figure, even with enhancement. A shadow should be quite visible on the light puddle if this was some conventional light source.\" He adds that a shadow is not even visible with nega- tive imaging techniques-\"which should indicate the shadow as white against the dark (reversed) light area. How do you project a very intense light of consider- able dimensions on a solid figure with no resulting shadow?\" He also notes that the worker does not move or change position while in the light, \"as I stitched (overlaid) these two images photographically.\" Ted admits feeling perplexed by the footage: \"1 can't imagine how this could be done, especially with a se- curity camera unit. Things happen too fast in the blink of an eye. (You cannot actually see what is happening without slowing it down to a frame by frame view- ing). It would have to be a very elaborate hoax in- deed!\" However, it is the return of this worker nearly two hours later in the detached \"puddle of light\" that in- trigues Ted the most. He describes similarities with other UFO cases. \"I have dealt with other lights of this type in rela- tion to physical trace/landing events involving UFO sightings. As a matter of fact I'm currently working a series of Missouri cases involving large light puddles moving around in fields with no apparent light source or beam. In one case the light puddle was actually moving up a hill toward several witnesses, and no source for the light could be seen.\" In conclusion, Ted states that this is an important video segment which \"presents a number of very in- teresting possibilities for information\" in the UFO research field. Analysis by Dan Ahrens Dan Ahrens, a computer analyst, performed his own independent study as well. His frame-by-frame research helped to establish geometric angles for de- termining the height and distance away of the light source. By studying the shadows cast by the light through the gate and onto the ground, he determined that the light source was at a 30-degree angle above the hori- zon and positioned at least 20 feet above the ground. By studying other shadows cast by the fence and gate, he determined that the object was at least 30-40 feet from the worker, depending on his own distance from the gate. The significance of Dan's analysis is that he places the location of the intense light source in the air. It also seems clear from his findings that the source"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal May 1999 Page? By looking at the light angles on this image. A person, by doing a little math, could just about tell how close the object that created the light is to this man in the image. The angle from the two lines on the tile floor shows that the object was not all that far away. The angle from the light shining down on the floor casting a shadow from the gate also shows that it was definitely above the man, but not at a great distance from him. of this light is not that far away and not very high from the ground. Dan also is intrigued by the power surges and effects on the video cameras: \"The camera in the upper right hand corner of the quad screen surveillance image was the first to experi- ence an effect from what seems to be electromagnetic interference. Then the other cameras follow in the se- quence of frames shortly after that. These cameras would be located throughout a building and not, obvi- ously, in the same room or vicinity for an efficient sur- veillance system,\" he notes. \"The electromagnetic interference would be ema- nating out over a large area to encompass an entire building and with such an intensity to affect all four cameras. The top two screens most likely are views at the rear of the factory closest to the unknown light source, while the bottom two views-which are last to be affected and first to recover-are probably two cam- eras located toward the front of the plant. Personally, I do not see how a quad screen video surveillance sys- tem could be faked with an electromagnetic burst, or 34.4 A=85° Estimating width of gate at 6 feet by approximating the height of the man at 6 feet. Shadow shows approximate 30-degree angle to the object. The object would be between 30 feet and 40 feet away from the man, depending on how far the man stepped out from the gate. The object would be at a height of approximately 20 feet from the ground. This is given that an approximate 85- degree angle exists at point A and B. what could even create a burst of that magnitude. Indi- vidual video frames could be faked by use of good stu- dio equipment, but not on a quad screen with four cam- eras at different locations.\" Analysis by Micah Collins Another computer/photography specialist, Micah Collins, used his sophisticated equipment to examine this footage. He looked closely for evidence of any kind of a hoax and could not find anything to suggest a hoax had been perpetrated. My own analysis In my own analysis I shall add that when the first \"puddle of light\" without the worker appears at 1 -06-29 a.m., it appears lower on the top right video screen near the bottom edge. This is merely because the video frame is in a slow downward roll on that video screen as the camera is affected by the power blackout. The silhouette of the gate, fence, and metal sign in front of the \"light puddles\" clearly establish (1) the factory is indeed without lights or electrical power at that mo-"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PageS May 1999 MUFON UFO Journal ment, (2) the cameras are not malfunctioning, but in fact recording a dark scene, and (3) the location of the \"light puddles\" just outside the gate. The after-image of the first \"light puddle\" at 1:06:29 a.m. which is burned into the video camera lens on the following frames also proves that the camera was re- cording a bright image in a dark area, and that there is indeed a pause between the two occurrences of the \"light puddle\" at 1:06:29 and 1:06:31 a.m. One could hypothesize that the first \"light puddle\" was either targeting a place to deposit the worker or simply displaying the beginning of the transfer pro- cess. The second \"light puddle,\" which clearly contains the worker, occurs in the same precise location as the first \"light puddle.\" The appearance of the worker in that exact location when the lights in the factory come back on adds more credibility to the reality of this bi- zarre event. Another detail that makes this event harder to stage is simply the amount of vomiting this worker produces. He could not hold that amount just in his mouth. He actually vomits twice-a small amount followed by a much larger amount-and he appears genuinely shaken and disoriented by his slower movement and stagger- ing away. This behavior was confirmed by the secu- rity man who immediately went down to check on him. Similarity to abduction research data Missing Time-Assuming that this man does disap- pear with the first blinding light and returns with the later \"light puddles,\" he has been missing for 1 hour and 50 minutes. This time lapse (110 minutes) is highly consistent with the most frequently reported durations of \"missing time\" in abduction data: 90 to 120 min- utes. The time is \"missing\" because the subject rarely can recall where he/she has been. The security guard not only confirms that he \"can't find the guy\" for a \"couple of hours,\" but also reports that upon the worker's re- turn that he is \"acting all weird and scared and like he can't remember anything. \" Compelled or Drawn Outside-Many subjects re- port having been strangely compelled to stop their cars, or go outside, or drive to a remote area for no logical reason. This man is seen to go \"out back to check on something\" during his work shift. Of course it is not known whether or not he was simply performing a work function. Nevertheless, he is immediately captured by the light. He apparently saw something in the air because he has stopped walk- ing and turned to face the source of light when it hits him. initial Brilliant Light-A blinding white light is of- ten reported at the onset of an abduction. It is usually described as \"brighter than the sun\" and illuminating an area \"like daylight.\" Some subjects feel stunned, like Travis Walton (Fire in the Sky) and Kathy Davis (Intruders), by the sudden burst of light. The angle of this light burst places its source in the air. Suddenness-Many subjects report feeling quickly removed from their surroundings. Many others cannot even recall flying through the air or how they entered the craft. A number of subjects report they disappeared in a flash of light and suddenly found themselves aboard a craft. The initial light in this film brilliantly illuminates the whole outdoors area in just 1/10 of a second. Electromagnetic Interference-Countless cases of UFO encounters include details of electrical interfer- ence: car engines, headlights, generators, battery-operated devices, video cameras, networks of lighting, magnetometers, etc. All four surveillance cameras immediately react as this burst of light en- ergy occurs. After a few seconds of interference, they appear to return to normal surveillance. Power Blackout-Power outages are quite common with UFO visitations. Powerful electromagnetic fields are assumed to be the cause of such blackouts when no conventional explanations are evident. Just before this worker reappears \"out of thin air\" at 1:06 a.m., all four surveillance cameras display dark screens with minimal distortion. The cameras must be operating on a battery or emer- gency power source, because they continue to record the darkened factory for those few seconds. One cam- era is able to record the \"puddle of light\" which ap- pears in the top right screen. This confirms that there is indeed a temporary power blackout. Return Via Light-Similar to their initial departure, many subjects report returning in a beam of light rather quickly. This light source is unique in that it seems self-contained and not illuminating the surrounding environment. Nor is it connected to any beam in the air. Similar \"puddles\" of detached light have been ob- served in numerous other cases. This rapid three-second process appears to deposit the man on the ground just outside the back gate. Fetal Position-A number of abduction participants recall being either taken or returned in a \"rolled-up\" fetal position (Linda Cortile, Witnessed). Most sub- jects report being returned in a prone position-not on their feet. This worker is clearly crouched face down in a similar fetal position. Physiological/Emotional Responses-Most abductees report nausea, amnesia, fear, confusion, fa- tigue, or disorientation. This worker demonstrates nau- sea through his sudden vomiting, fatigue through his slow movements, and fear, amnesia, and disorienta- tion as reported by the security man who immediately"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal May 1999 Page 9 went to check on him upon his return. Further evidence of trauma both physically and emotionally is suggested by his going home early that night, reporting in \"sick\" for the next three days, and then never returning to work ever again. Conclusions This unusual video footage contains images and events that cannot be explained easily or with conven- tional reasons. Most of what occurs cannot be seen easily by normal viewing, but only by stop-action, frame by frame analysis. This sheds much doubt on it being a constructed hoax. A hoax would be dramatic and easy to see for maximum effect. Nobody is making any claims or seek- ing any publicity. In fact the security man would not reveal the identity of the worker, the factory, or even himself-for fear of ridicule as expressed in his letter. Experts are both impressed and perplexed by the in- triguing details in the video images. The facts that can be. learned from this videotape and the security man's letter are consistent with data from abduction research. Further analysis shall con- tinue because there may be much more we can learn about UFO abductions, if the film is authentic. However, at this point I shall suggest that we prob- ably have a genuine videotape of a man's UFO abduc- tion and his return nearly two hours later. Firmage announces ISSO, issues call for papers Joe Firmage has announced formation of the Inter- national Space Sciences Organization (ISSO), to be formally launched in May, and has requested papers \"from serious researchers of cutting-edge discoveries relevant to history, new principles in science, concepts of spirituality, and unusual phenomena in evidence.\" Evaluated by a review process conducted through a board of advisers, the top 10 papers will be featured as part of \"The Truth Files,\" and each author will be in- vited to address the public through a dedicated 3-hour ISSO radio broadcast on the Internet and air waves . Each of these authors will also receive a $1,000 honorarium from ISSO, and each of the authors of the top five papers will be given an additional $5,000 to be used to advance their domains of research.

Upon taking a closer look through binoculars I managed to spot several smaller objects surrounding the large object. I managed to count at least forty smaller objects. I invited my sister to witness the event as a backup eyewitness. As we passed the binoculars back and forth to each other we suddenly realized that the George Filer smaller objects were entering the large object one by one very slowly. It took about half an hour for the smaller objects to enter the large one. Another large object of the same size joined the first object side by side and they both proceeded to move south slowly at first and then disappeared outwards into space.

For all those who may think that they are real, ex- cuse me, it is not working on those of us who stick to science or who are deservingly critical of documents that are only available as 2nd, 3rd, and 4th level cop- ies. There are plenty of prominent people in the UFO hierarchy who do not \"buy\" the original MJ-12 mate- rial as being genuine. This is especially true of the Eisenhower Briefing Document, which Wood must realize his entire case rests on. He states that we who claim that these documents could be faked are \"off base,\" with a long paragraph of the things that would have to be done, including revamping an old printing press, to pull off the job of fakery. I have operated a graphic arts studio for 15 years, and I could have \"faked\" any document I have ever seen in the UFO field-and could have done a bet- ter job of it in almost every case. It would be a breeze to produce anything so simple, especially if all it had to be was a black and white Xerographic copy. And I could have done it 15 years ago as a student without having to have today's com- puters. Wood obviously does not know the capabili- ties of the graphics trade, old or new. Documents easy to fake He must begin to appreciate how easy it is to fake a document, including raised z's, and must appreciate that there are people out there who will do it for a giggle as the only necessary motivation. The article attempts to down play \"Provenance.\" But unlike the impression he would like to leave us with, About the Author Tom Deuley joined MUFON in 1977 as a Field Investigator and State Section Director in North Carolina. After moving to San Antonio, TX, he was elected to the MUFON Executive Commit- tee and Board of Directors as Corporate Secretary, and is Assistant to the International Director. Tom served as Texas State Director from 1984 until 1993, and organized the MUFON San Antonio Chapter. He has served on the National Board of Di- rectors for the Fund for UFO Research since its in- ception. He is the author of Chapter XVI, Radia- tion Survey of Landing Cases, for the Fourth Edi- tion of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual. Tom has been a board member of the UFO Research Coalition since it was organized in 1994. He is a veteran of the U.S. Navy, serving as both an enlisted man and officer, receiving his com- mission in 1972 after earning the B.S.E.E. from Auburn University. His service included assignment to a nuclear submarine. Tom retired from the Navy as a lieutenant commander. \"that it is not that big of thing\"-it is a very big thing. In fact until some unbiased researcher can actually get \"originals\" of these documents from absolutely reli- able sources and test the paper, test the ink, and get a real expert's opinion on the production process, the documents are not worth the paper they are portrayed on. Even then a second \"real\" copy from some sepa- rate reliable source should be sought out to verify the first. Wood makes a comparison with antiques. We are not dealing here with antiques and old dressers, we are dealing with trying to rewrite the history of the past 50 years, and it should not be taken so lightly-there are lots of antiques and lots of them are fakes that get by very good experts. If you are checking out an antique you go to an antique expert; if you want to check out a document you go to a document expert-there are plenty around and they have no ax to grind. It is not true that by simply looking at a copy of a document it can be recognized as genuine, even by a recognized expert. I am sure that a real expert who may be asked for an opinion may give an official nod upon an initial viewing of a document, wherein he has no expertise in the subject matter. But then if some- one would tell him that it is not unusual for phony docu- ments to be found in the UFO subject area, he would withdraw his nod and revert to science and other ap- propriate methods. The article states, \"Documents with the caveat MAJIC, Majestic or MJ-12 have been around since 1984...\" However, I have known about them since"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal May 1999 Page 11 1980-81, when I was first asked, while working at NSA, to see if I could find out anything about them. Since none of them checked out to have anything to do with UFOs there was nothing to be said. In the case of MJ- 12, in particular, it did not fit in any code word pat- tern. I relayed this back to the people asking, so it is not as if some didn't know. On the other hand I had just told them, and possibly others, of a term that would not come out of the system, should it be checked on. These terms, from the Eisenhower Briefing Docu- ment, have to be wondered about, in any case, since the document itself is dubious at best. No crash on Mexican border I am sure that at least one paragraph in the EBD will not hold up. I am referring to the paragraph that talks about the crash on the U.S.-Mexico border. Af- ter three trips to the border I can reassure all readers that no UFO crashed in the vicinity of El Indo-Guerrero at any time. Let Wood, or anyone else, bring forth someone who has been to Mexico to verify the crash discussed in the EBD. Anyone caring to prove that a UFO did crash along the border is welcome to go on the next trip, providing they are willing to pay there own expenses. We can show them around, provide an interpreter, and introduce them to the last three mayors of Guerrero so they can work with officials. We would also be glad to show them one of the alleged crash sites. Since that paragraph in the EBD does not stand up to scrutiny, then why should anyone be expected to believe any of it, let alone all of the documents that have grown out of it. 1 have'heard some say, \"Well, some of the informa- tion in the EBD document is disinformation.\" That's fine, but who is it that knows one from the other? What it looks like to me is that \"the experts\" get to choose what they want to be real information, and anything anyone finds real fault with is obvious disinformation. Baloney . If the whole document and every word and inference in it cannot stand up, then the entire docu- ment has to be kept under suspicion. The idea of something like MJ-12 existing did not originate with the EBD as the article might have you think.* I am positive that the idea can be traced to at least 1979. Such discussions occurred during the for- mation of the Fund for UFO Research many times. No surprise On a couple of occasions it may have been discussed in the presence of someone later known to have pro- ' duced at least one fake document, so I was never sur- prised to see something like the EBD show up. I would think such an idea as \"some small group\" was around long before this, and that this idea was not the baby of either the writer of the MJ-12 material or the Fund for UFO Research. At the very beginning of the article Wood leaves us to surmise that since the document shown next to the first paragraph came from an FOIA request and had the term \"MJ-12\" on it that the document and MJ-12 must be real and must exist. Well, not necessarily so. It is simple enough to send such a document into the system and then turn around and have it come out again as part of an FOIA. Easy in/easy out How could that happen? Easy enough. Once it got into the building, which is very simple (send a letter), it could easily have found its way to the general file on UFO FOIAs. Then when someone else requests infor- mation on MJ-12 it comes back out, giving it an en- dorsement that was never intended. Let's get use to the idea that there are some unscru- pulous characters hanging around the edges of this busi- ness. Some are fooling us, and some are being fooled. Besides, \"CIA Top Secret\" is not something that I would expect to see in a distribution list on a CIA docu- ment, maybe CIA XXX (division, department, etc.). Just putting it in a \"Top Secret\" (TS) file would not mean much at CIA, considering the amount of TS that is around there. And yes, I could fake this one too- without making that sort of mistake. As it turns out, this sort of \"mess up\" is pretty much why it was so easy for Don Berliner to tell Stanton Friedmen that it was OK for Stan to show the SOM 01-1 manual to Wood. Don took a copy of the docu- ment to the GAO when he thought the GAO was re- ally going to do a credible job. The Air Force declared the SOM 01-1 a fake. Then it began to be sent out to those who properly requested UFO information via an FOIA. Do they tell everyone its a fake? If it is sent out by the Air Force and they don't say it's a fake, does that make it genu- ine? Role of the FBI Something else that needs cleared up is the fact that the FBI investigates all cases of classified documents leaking into the public realm. Have you heard of any FBI Investigators talking to anyone in the UFO com- munity about leaked classified documents lately? The FBI investigates all leaked classified documents; what the subject is has nothing to do with it. They also, investigate leaked fake documents-es- pecially if someone is using a government department's name or title to assist them in some ploy. By the way, it is rumored that the FBI has investigated the EBD. When I know more about this I will tell everyone. I was at NSA for four years and checked into the UFO business pretty closely, and what I found was a few individuals who had a personal interest and some"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Page 12 May 1999 MUFON UFO Journal anecdotal stories that, let's say, left me wondering a bit. That is to say I never saw anything to confirm NSA's interest in UFOs whatsoever-or any other gov- ernment agency as far as that goes. I was never told not to look around or even discouraged from looking into things myself. I, in fact, had a pretty free hand to look just about anywhere I wanted, and just about ev- eryone I worked with knew of my interest. Before it was over I had a file drawer full of material, but noth- ing that was of scientific value, and nothing that veri- fied that NSA even cared-nor CIA, nor DIA. They would have cared As an aside, I was in an office where they would have cared. We would have been very interested in advanced communications systems. The only thing that did come up concerning UFOs was the disgruntled \"time wasting\" attitude that pervaded those who had to do FOIA file searches. Doing FOIA file searches is not exactly career en- hancing. This is especially irritating when the searcher did not expect to find anything and someone like me comes along and says, \"Oh yeah, I have a whole file drawer full of that stuff.\" I believed then that a lot of the material I had collected was some of the material NSA would not release in the CAUS FOIA case. Since its less redacted release I am sure that is so. Since Wood states he knows of someone who shred- ded copies of the EBD and the SOM 1-01, he has a real opportunity there. Top Secret documents are not simply handed to someone to shred. They cannot be destroyed without specific instructions from the origi- nator or superior authority, and then the act of destruc- tion must be recorded and reported, including several signatures. There are records of the destruction somewhere. Lets find out who the fellow is that destroyed the docu- ments, find out what command he was working for at the time; find out what Admiral he is talking about, find out who the Top Secret control officer was at the time, and find out what COMSEC office he reported his Top Secret Account holdings to. There should be a whole lot of records of this destruction. It could be the Admiral had a personal interest. Records of downgrading If the argument would be that it was all downgraded and unclassified when it was destroyed, then there are records of the downgrading along the way. Automatic downgrading?-not every thing is automatically down- graded, especially very important Top Secret world- shaking stuff. Now on the other hand, if I had stayed at NSA I would have taken copies of the EBD and the SOM-1 into the office and stored them in my top file drawer along with the rest of the UFO collection I had there. In fact I would have probably made 6 or 8 copies to send around to others there that had a personal interest in the subject of UFOs. I would have sent a few other copies down to friends of mine at the CIA. Now, since these documents had markings of \"Top Secret\" on them, you cannot walk out the door with them once you get them in. What do you do when you leave and go on to another job? You turn them in for destruction on a standard form. Should be records So before it would all be over, there would be at least 12 to 16 records of destroying documents marked \"Top Secret,\" with a subject line concerning UFOs. It could also happen, knowing that a similar situation actually did occur, that one or more copies of the docu- ments could have found their way to the NSA Library, and could have been subsequently released through an FOIA. Not preposterous. It happened-and the subject was UFOs. Wood objects to the idea that there are fake docu- ments in the UFO records as if they have never really shown up before. I have a fake CIA Document con- cerning UFOs. I know who faked it. I know why they faked it, and I squelched it. Wood needs to take a box over to Richard Hall's place if he really wants to see a pile of fakes. Fake documents are disregarded and often discarded, as they should be. Who cares. The only reason we care in any case is so we can identify the duffus that is producing this stuff and figuratively hoist him on to his own pe- tard. Next Month: SOM 01-1. John Mack's new abduction book features 'cross-cultural synthesis' Harvard University professor of psychiatry Dr. John Mack, author of the 1994 bestseller Abduction: Hu- man Encounters With Aliens, has written a new book, \"Passport to the Cosmos: Transformative Lessons of Alien Encounters. Crown Books will publish the book this fall. Since writing his first book on abduction, Mack says he has taken a cross-cultural approach to the study of abductions. He and his colleagues at the Program for Extraordinary Experience Research (PEER) have interviewed more than 200 individuals from six conti- nents, including Native American and African Zulu experiencers. \"This experience with members of native cultures, coupled with the evolving perspectives offered by ab- duction experiencers within the Western culture, has resulted in a new synthesis that may assist many people to come to terms with these experiences,\" says Mack."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal May 1999 Page 13 Projects planned Roswell 1999: What's hew? By Thomas J. Carey & Donald R. Schmitt As the millennium draws inexorably closer, we can look back and see that the 50th Anniversary Year of 1997 witnessed unprecedented interest in the most fa- mous and most thoroughly investigated UFO case of all time: the alleged 1947 crash of a flying saucer near the town of Roswell, NM, and its subsequent retrieval and coverup by the United States military. Case closed? Now, two years after those heady days, one may justifiably ask, what has become of Roswell? As the song sung by Peggy Lee laments, \"Is that all there is?\" No longer on evening news broadcasts, is anything going on, or have things reverted back to where they were prior to the anniversary? That would be a sleepy little desert town proudly proclaiming, \"Howdy, from the Middle of Nowhere!\" according to one pre-anni- versary post card. Hardly. In the town of Roswell, it can be reported that new motels continue to spring up at a brisk pace to handle the anticipated continuous stream of visitors to the International UFO Museum. Roswell is now in- cluded as a \"must-see\" stop in most tour packages to New Mexico and west Texas solely because of the al- leged 1947 incident. At the UFO Museum itself, besides its own tour of- fice, a growing research library, and a regular sched- ule of lectures, the exhibits continue to be expanded and updated as new information is developed. Plans for a new multi-million-dollar facility on the .edge of town are moving along. Recently, the Museum wel- comed its 500,000th visitor. More and more in the minds of the public, the mere mention of the town's name is becoming synonymous with UFOs. But what of the Roswell Incident itself? Is it over, passe or, less likely, solved? Has the Fat Lady, because of the continued absence of verified \"hard evidence,\" coupled with the passage of so many years, finally sung on this one? Renewed energy and commitment In the Spring of 1998, the two authors met for the first time in several years and agreed on the need to continue an aggressive, proactive Roswell investiga- tion, with an increased sense of urgency since witnesses seemed to be \"dropping like flies.\" At some point in the not too distant future, there will be no first-hand witnesses left to interview. Even now, we are talking with an increasing num- ber of children and grandchildren of deceased princi- pals. We also felt that the case, as it currently stands, is still incomplete and probably not entirely correct and we are not talking here about Project Mogul, which had and has absolutely no bearing on the Roswell events of July, 1947). Believing that there was yet more to learn about those long-ago events, the authors agreed to collabo- rate. As a result, we made two research trips to New Mexico in 1998, one in May and one in October, for the purpose of \"mining\" for new witnesses and re-in- terviewing old witnesses. Contrary to finding a stale, over-plowed landscape populated with well-worn paths and dry holes, we were assuredly impressed by the number of new leads that we were able to obtain, as well as some surprising new twists in the testimony of \"old\" witnesses. Right now, we believe that we are on the verge of a new, or at least a modified, Roswell timeline-and in possession of more leads than we can ever hope to fol- low in our lifetimes, given our present resources. The following is the authors' first collaborative effort, rep- resenting our consensus as to where we believe the Roswell investigation will be heading as we approach the new millennium. The search for physical evidence No aspect of the Roswell investigation has been more frustrating and less fruitful than the efforts of Roswell investigators to turn up or, in some cases, try to pry loose \"a piece\" of irrefutable hard evidence with \"out-of-this-world\" properties that can be traced back to the 1947 incident. Time and again, hopes are raised only to be dashed when the alleged possessor of such an item cannot or will not deliver at the moment of truth; or the claimed hard evidence turns out to be a complete fiction (or, to be charitable, a \"misunderstanding\") when the claim is investigated more closely; or when an artifact actu- ally does get into our hands, it turns out instead to be an exotic piece of jewelry. During the Roswell Anniversary Days of 1997, Derrell Sims and Paul Davids held an all too brief news conference to offer up a piece of metal that they claimed came from the Roswell crash via the all too familiar \"unnamed source.\" They claimed that tests had been performed on the artifact in question which suggested an extraterrestrial origin for it and that, additionally, there were other such pieces then being tested \"at re- spected universities\" throughout the land which would no doubt also prove to be of extraterrestrial \"etiology.\" Dr. Roger Leir, a member of that team, assures us that ongoing tests have also proved positive. Unfortu- nately, in the year-and-a-half since the press confer- ence, Paul Davids has yet to leam the identity of the"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Page 14 May 1999 MUFON UFO Journal Co-author Don Schmitt works the phones at the International UFO Museum and Research Center in Roswell, setting up interviews. \"unnamed source\". Not good. In 1996, paranormal radio talk show host Art Bell came into possession, again from an anonymous source, of small bits and pieces of metal claimed to have come from the Roswell crash. Metallurgical tests were performed, and the bits and pieces of metal, known collectively as \"Arts Parts\" seemed to be made mostly of aluminum, but with a dash of a few other trace metals for good measure. Is that it? Where do things stand now? It's been three years. More tests? Anybody heard? No follow through. Fade to black. When Roswell researchers obtain a lead that in- volves claimed physical evidence, all other leads au- tomatically go to the back of the \"queue\" until the lead is exhausted (unfortunately, usually as indicated above). Physical evidence 'out there' However, we are confident that such physical evi- dence is \"out there\" somewhere, and one of these days, hopefully, our frustrations will be rewarded. At present, our investigation is in possession of several such leads that we hope will bear fruit: 1. We are presently trying to enlist the cooperation of a first-hand witness who claims to have actually held a piece of something similar to Frankie Rowe's \"memory metal\" in his hands within the past two years. We have gotten as far as having the witness agree to meet with us personally to try to coordinate with the owners of the artifact to let us examine it. It is quite conceivable that by the time you are reading this we will be meeting with all parties concerned. 2. We know of a retired MP (military policeman) Co-author Tom Carey, right, with the former Roswell AAF Public Information Officer Walter Haut. whom we will call \"Dutch\" who claims to have a piece of the Roswell wreckage stored in his attic for safe keeping and who will supposedly give up the piece to civilian investigators when he dies. But when we talked to him, although in his late 70's, he sounded like he was still in pretty good shape. How long do we sit around and wait and do nothing? (and we are NOT remotely suggesting anything like a Kevorkian inter- vention here, folks). From a body? 3. We have spoken several times to a relative of a well-known Roswell personage who claims to know of parties who have pieces of the Roswell crash mate- rial. When pressed further, he identified one of them as none other than himself. When asked for its prov- enance, he stated that it came, not from the craft, but from \"one of the bodies\" from the crashed craft and that it is currently being analyzed by degreed profes- sionals in the appropriate forensic fields. He claims that the artifact is not a tissue or fabric sample, but \"something else.\" He plans on going public with this and other Roswell-related \"evidence\" in his posses- sion in 1999. We shall see. 4. There are several \"proactive\" steps that we are planning to take to try to secure physical evidence origi- nating from the 1947 Roswell crash. These are in the formative stages at the moment, as each requires re- sources outside the normal resource-range of most Roswell investigators, including us.

The argument, of course, is about just what came down. Archaeological consultants to our inves- tigation have told us that if pieces of whatever came down in Brazel's pasture on that fateful day had lain on the desert floor for even a period as short as one day, there is an excellent chance that rodents would have carried pieces of it into their nests. We know that whatever the debris was, there were many, many small pieces of it scattered, according to Jesse Marcel, over an area 3/4 mi. long by several hun- dred feet wide. We also know that the material had lain on the desert floor for not one but for at least four days, maybe longer—ample time for eclectic rodents to conduct their business. 18 inches deep? Having been to the Brazel site several times, rodent holes as well as small sink holes indeed are in evi- dence. We are also encouraged to learn from our ar- chaeological consultants that what we seek (whatever it turns out to be) should in all likelihood be waiting for us at a depth of no more than 18 inches in soil that they term, \"pack rat midden.\" The second project is also located at the debris field site located on the former Foster/Brazel Ranch. A half- dozen or so first-hand witnesses have reported a long, fresh \"gouge\" or \"skid marks\" running for some dis- tance amongst the debris that wasn't there prior to July, 1947, the thought being that whatever caused the de- bris also caused the \"gouge.\" The \"gouge\" was reported to have been visible at least for a few years after 1947 by several eye-wit- nesses, including Bill Brazel, Jr. and Gen. Arthur Exon, who flew over the site in 1949. It is not visible today, having been filled-in by deposits laid down by wind erosion, heavy summer rains, and livestock traffic over the ensuing years, but we know its former location from living eye-witnesses. Fingerprint of 'gouge' We also know from geologists with whom we have spoken that we may be able to obtain a \"fingerprint\" of the former \"gouge,\" if there ever was such a defor- mation of the landscape, by using a device known as a \"GPR\" (Ground Penetrating Radar) which traverses the target area and produces a readout or \"fingerprint\" of anomalies, depending upon the depth of the strata being diagnosed. Results from such a test would amount to either positive or negative physical evidence, corroborating or not corroborating this aspect of the Roswell Incident. The problem, of course, is securing the use of a GPR instrument for our purposes. At present, we have an offer from a national laboratory for the loan of such equipment and have had a meeting with a major uni- The former Foster Ranch was pocked with sink holes such as this one, each of which could trap small pieces of debris, according to the authors. versity to sponsor and participate in such a project. The third project resulted from a \"town meeting\" that we held in Corona, NM, in October, 1998, seek- ing informants and/or information relating to the 1947 incident. One of the items to come out of the meeting was confirmation of a story that we had heard before, but could not \"pin down. This was a story of a young fellow who lived in the Corona area at the time named Fred Miller (he was killed in Viet Nam in 1967). Young Fred, according to friends of his, had some- how obtained a number of pieces of the Roswell de- bris from one of the crash sites and had shown pieces of it around to a number of locals (confirmed by sur- viving eye-witnesses). As told to us, a piece of the \"memory metal\" that Fred had in his possession had somehow made its way to the senior prom one June night at Corona High School a year or so after the inci- dent (where, according to eyewitnesses, it was passed around for amusement). Word had it that Fred \"stashed\" all of his Roswell material, as well as anything else he did not want oth- ers to find in his \"personal cave.\" The problem was, and still is, that there are many, many caves in the Corona area-too many and too dangerous (rattlesnakes like to set up shop in them) to try to examine for our purposes. To cut to the chase, on our most recent trip to New Mexico we were able to identify \"Miller's Cave.\" Do we have any brave spelunkers out there?

The 16 states which permit citizens to pass laws by direct initiative are Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Cali- fornia, Colorado, Idaho, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. In addition there are seven states which permit indi- rect initiative: Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Ne- vada, Ohio, Utah, and Washington. The indirect ini- tiative produces law when the people submit the pro- posal to the state legislature during the regular session and win approval. By utilizing the initiative in the appropriate states, proponents expect to indirectly influence the federal government when several states call on Congress to investigate the matter with open hearings and the grant- ing of immunity by waiver of security oaths in order to encourage testimony by military and civilian person- nel. Proponents believe that scores of current and former military personnel and other government workers stand ready to testify if given immunity. This initiative movement was developed by Robert Bletchman, an attorney and MUFON's Director of Public Relations, and Larry Bryant, MUFON's Direc- tor of Government Affairs. \"Formidable hurdles, such as gathering tens of thou- sands of petition signatures, lie ahead,\" says MUFON International Director Walter Andrus, Jr., \"but if you believe that our constitutional republic depends on an informed citizenry, and that the UFO problem has as much political presence as it has scientific promise, then join us in this effort.\" With chapters in nearly every state and in 45 for- eign countries, MUFON serves as the world's largest member organization dedicated to the scientific study of UFO reports. Whether the initiative effort and resulting publicity will be coupled with some sort of membership drive, as has been suggested, is still under consideration, pending feedback from the various state organizations, according to Andrus. Ted Phillips sees elk case as possible group 1 object By George Filer Ted Phillips responded to my questions concerning the February Elk abduction by a UFO in Washington State (see story on Page 18): With a database of 4,000+ trace events, one clearly sees three primary types of objects reported. The Elk case (a very, very interesting event) falls right into the Group 1 Small hemispherical objects, 4 to 12 feet in diameter, 4 to 5 feet thick, glowing brightly at night, showing a metallic surface in daylight. These objects rarely touch the ground,remaining sta- tionary 1 to 5 feet above the ground surface. External details, such as \"vents\" or \"extensions\" have been re- ported. They are reported as silent, humming, whis- tling, and rumbling (at hover). This type of object leaves traces such as 4 to 12 ft rings which are burnt or dehydrated. Tree damage has been reported. Animal & human reaction (sometimes quite extreme reactions) are of- ten reported. This type of trace-related object clearly is quite similar to the Elk object. I've tried to obtain all details possible on this case, with little luck so far. As far as weight estimates-that's a tough one as they don't touch ground. The Delphos, KS, and Langenburg, Saskatchewan, objects (to name but a few) were quite similar in de- scription. The comment I received was that the object was only slightly larger than the elk. This would indi- cate a diameter of around 8 feet. I would like to see a sketch of the elk object in order to see if the thickness would be around 5 feet. I find this case of tremendous interest as it seems to fit the Group 1 so closely. As far as abductions and trace cases-no I have not seen any direct links in the high strangeness cases; the Delphos case would come closest. Before the elk I started looking into levitation cases involving traces and haye numerous events in which humans, animals, and vehicles were lifted or at least an attempt was made to lift these items. It would appear that the \"little guys\" are not so smart after all as they seem to have lots of problems lifting such objects from the ground (as indicated with the elk).

In those situations, the absence of any confirm- ing report uncovered in our background checks might be the real story. The Event At 7:30 on a balmy Wednesday evening, Feb. 3, 1999, a 49-year-old dental specialist was returning home when she observed a bulbous domed disc mov- ing at traffic speed just over residential rooftops and less than 200 feet away. The vehicle sported a central rim, over which were evenly spaced flashing white lights. A larger white light at the top also flashed rhythmically. With her side win- dow partly lowered, she could not detect any sound from the vehicle. Awed, she followed the object for ten minutes as it cruised slowly through the Miami, FL, neighborhoods before she lost sight of it. She quickly backtracked to her home and called to her 13-year-old son. From a second-floor window, they spotted a large white light in the distance, likewise apparently just over rooftop level and moving away from their location until out of sight. The Investigation Miami field investigator Mary Margaret Zimmer was out of state when she received an e-mail message from the National UFO Reporting Center. Ten days later she interviewed the primary witness and her son, find- ing them credible and perplexed. The woman is quite religious, devotes professional time to indigent clients, and has had no particular in- terest in the UFO subject. Ms. Zimmer contacted the police department only to be told that no one else had reported anything un- usual on the evening in question. The National Weather Service spokesman stated that its weather balloons, launched at 6 a.m. and 6 p.m., could not possibly have been in the area at'7:30 p.m. The Goodyear site con- firmed that their blimps were not in the area at that time. She then retraced the sighting route twice, determin- ing distances, but failing to notice anything in the form of a structure or otherwise that could account for the report. As a final outreach effort, she posted a message on her SKYSCAN web site, hoping for results, but re- ceiving none. Her case report includes completed Forms 1 and 2, along with a vicinity map showing the woman's route while following the object. Employing artistic skill, she complemented the witness' crude drawings with her own, prepared from the verbal description. A photo of the woman and-creatively-the seal from a yogurt container to indicate vehicle's particular metallic ap- pearance complete the report materials. If there is any insight to be tucked away for future use, it is borne out from the in-depth interview Ms. Zimmer conducted. The witness revealed an incident of footsteps heard when no one else was present, a shadowy presence moving swiftly in her home, unexplained bruises and other marks, plus three miscarriages over the years, in none of which a formed fetus was expelled. Though abduction might be the root cause, that was not broached in their discussions. When someone follows a large, brightly lighted, unconventional aircraft moving low and slowly over miles in a populated area on a warm early evening, it is only reasonable to expect others to notice it as well. But when our best investigative effort comes up empty, is it logical to conclude that-somehow beyond our grasp of science-no one else could see it? Or that, for all those other potential observers, cognition of this plainly visible sight was impossible? That its appear- ance was intended for the witness alone? Trio of planets located around sun-like Upsilon Andromedae Astronomers from four research institutions have discovered strong evidence for a trio of extrasolar plan- ets that orbit the star Upsilon Andromedae. This is the first multiple planet system ever found around a nor- mal star other than our own sun. The closest planet in the Upsilon Andromedae system was detected in 1996 by San Francisco State University (SFSU) astronomers Geoffrey Marcy and R. Paul Butler. Now, after 11 years of telescope obser- vations at Lick Observatory near San Jose, CA, the signals of two additional planets have been found. Therefore, Upsilon Andromedae harbors the first known planetary system reminiscent of our own Solar System. At the same time, astronomers from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) in Cambridge, MA and the High Altitude Observatory (HAO) in Boulder, CO have independently found the two outer planets around Upsilon Andromedae."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Page 18 May 1999 MUFON UFO Journal Elk abduction Editor's Note: Following is a preliminary sum- mary of the \"abduction\" of an elk in Washington State, reportedly witnessed by 14 forestry workers. This Investigation summary was prepared by Peter B. Davenport, Director, National UFO Re- porting Center, and Robert A. Fairfax, Director of Investigations, Mutual UFO Network, for Wash- ington State, based on contacts with three of the witnesses, others who know them, a visit to the site, and the inspection of the carcass of an adult elk. Incident Summary: On Thursday, Feb. 25, 1999, at just a few minutes before noon, three forestry workers who were plant- ing seedling trees in the mountains of Washington State witnessed a small, disc-shaped object slowly drift over a nearby ridge to their south, and descend into the val- ley to the north of their position. The object descended silently with what seemed to the witnesses a purpose- ful manner, exhibiting a slight \"wobble\" to its flight. The three workers at first thought the object was some kind of parachute that was drifting and descend- ing, but they quickly realized that their initial impres- sion was not correct. They shouted to their eleven co-workers nearby, who were working on the north-facing hillside, and all fourteen members of the work crew watched the object for an estimated 3-5 minutes. Within seconds of their first observation of the ob- ject, the witnesses became aware that the object was travelling generally in the direction of a herd of elk that they had been watching all morning. They contin- ued to watch as the object proceeded toward the herd until it.succeeded in getting quite close to the animals. The animals apparently remained unaware of the object's presence until it was within a very short dis- tance of the herd. Suddenly, the animals bolted, most of them running up the slope to their east. However, one adult animal was seen by the witnesses to separate itself from the herd and run or trot generally to the north, perhaps along a logging road. The witnesses report that at this point, the object quickly moved directly above the lone elk and seemed to-lift it off the ground, although no visible means of support of the animal was evident to the observers. The witnesses added that shortly after lifting the elk off the ground, the object seemed to begin to \"wobble\" to a more pronounced degree than it had exhibited ear- lier. In addition, as the object appeared to increase its altitude, the elk, which was suspended upright below the disc, rotated slowly beneath it and appeared to be This photo-graphic was prepared by Robert Fairfax and is used with permission of the National UFO Reporting Center. getting closer to the ventral surface of the disc. They also commented that the object seemed to increase in size slightly after it had picked up the animal. With the elk suspended below it, the object began to ascend slowly up a clear-cut slope to the east. How- ever, the witnesses watched it apparently brush the tops of nearby trees to the east, at which point it reversed its course and proceeded to the west. It executed a 360-degree turn to the left and may have gained some slight altitude in the process, the witnesses thought. After the object had completed its rum and was once again proceeding in a generally easterly direction, it. began ascending very quickly at what seemed to the witnesses to be a rather steep angle. It continued to ascend, and simply disappeared from sight of the wit- nesses. The witnesses stated that once the object had started to ascend and had climbed to an altitude above their vantage point, they no longer could see the animal sus- pended below the craft. Their presumption was that the animal had somehow been taken into the craft, al- though the witnesses could discern no \"door,\" or any kind of aperture through which the animal might have been conveyed into the craft. The witnesses also stated that following the inci- dent, the herd of elk remained in the same general area, although more closely huddled than had been the case earlier in the morning. The workers added that they, too, had remained closer to one another until their de- parture from the area at the end of the work day. v"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal May 1999 Page 19 MUFON Forum \"The Alien?\" Walt Andrus' article \"The Alien?\" in the March Jour- nal, raises more questions than it answers. The first is why he seemingly endorses the Aurora airship crash when no reputable historian-ufologist or other-has done so. S.E. Hayden, who wrote the crash story, was no re- porter .;. he was \"a cotton buyer and pan-time news- paper stringer.\" 1 A stringer is a freelance writer whose pay depends on the length of the story printed. Hayden sent his to two papers, the Fort Worth Register and the Dallas Morning News. After which no one knows what happened to him. Andrus then quotes from a 1925 letter ostensibly written by a Luther Mallow who claims that on \"the night of April 1 6th, 1897\" he was \"sort of a guide for a frog gigging expedition\" which included lawyer E. M. Roland and Col. R. N. Burt. During this expedi- tion, they saw lights in the distance, and on coming up to them saw \"several small 'people' moving around two well lit cigar shaped ships.\" Here the Journal reader is supposed to remember that the alleged occu- pant of the alleged crashed Aurora vehicle [also de- scribed as cigar-shaped] was \"a very small person.\" However, in Wallace 0. Chariton's The Great Texas Airship Mystery [a book I commend to all Aurora be- lievers], we read nothing of a frog gigging expedition [indeed, Mr. Chariton nowhere mentions any Luther Mallow], but learn that Mr. Rowland made a daylight sighting of a flying airship that \"had huge wings, the sides were oval like a large bay window, and it had a long sail-like tail.\" As for Col. Burt, then a bank cash- ier, he wrote the Dallas Morning News to say he had seen no airship and that his name had been misused by a hoaxer. 2 Chariton, it should be noted here, is a 5th genera- tion Texan, professional newspaperman, and .uiihor of a number of informal Texas histories. In ihe intro- duction to his airship book (the only book length treat- ment of the Texas airship sightings 1 know of) he thanks a number of well-known ufologists, including Jerome Clark, Daniel Cohen, Thomas Bullard, and... Walt Andrus! So much for Mallow's letter. Moving on now to Professor Slaughter and the \"skeleton.\" Slaughter says, in a curiously titled book (Fossil Remains of Mythical Creatures .., and how do mythi- cal creatures leave fossil remains behind, eh?) that he was taken to a site by a Richard Wallace, who had found the \"bones\" shown in Mr. Andrus' article. Now-was anyone present other than Professor Slaughter and Richard Wallace (whose current where- abouts are unknown) when the \"bones\" were exca- vated? Was there any documentation of the excava- tion-video camera, movies, print film camera? When did the excavation take place? Have the so-called bones been subjected to a forensic examina- tion by trained professionals? Has there been any pro- fessional examination of the \"clothing\" and the \"sword\" found with the bones? Who embedded the bones in plaster? When? Why? Has any formal paper been submitted to/published by a recognized and peer-reviewed scientific journal? And, of course, for many questions answered with \"No,\" the next question clearly is \"Why not?\" Let me close by noting that fossil bones can and have been faked. They will not stand up to professional scrutiny, but lay persons, willing to believe anything that apparently confirms their beliefs in various fringe science topics, can and have been fooled by fakery. Years ago I interviewed an artist, a professor at a northern California college, who showed me the skull of a Cyclops, several skeletons of Bigfoot, and a vari- ety of \"prehistoric creature\" skeletons. He had made them all. The article I subsequently wrote was a spoof, with a variety of clues scattered through it clearly indicating it was a joke ... it was even dated April First. 3 So, 1 think, should Mr. Andrus' tale.

Otherwise, they differ considerably in regard to what they tell us. The Pratt and Luce team once again has provided a great deal of food for thought in their reporting on sightings in Brazil, and especially the interview with the late Air Force intelligence colonel, Uyrange Hollanda. Their reporting does not bode well for \"friendly alien\" hypotheses. In recent years 1 have begun to reconsider how much of a government coverup there is, as opposed to an inability by high officials to digest what is going on and therefore reflexively screening out what they can- not accept as real, even making a joke about it and ridiculing those who think we may have visitors. My conclusion so far is that there is some of both, but defi- nitely a lot of the \"indigestibiiity factor.\" The situation in Brazil as described in this article fits that picture. High-level authorities on the one hand can recognize that very puzzling things are occurring, and at the same time avoid coming to grips with them in a meaningful way by rationalizing that they can't be real. Meanwhile, from the standpoint of consistency of detail reported by witnesses throughout the world and over the years, the Brazilian sightings fit perfectly, and strongly support the reality of the phenomenon. But we really don't know if anyone at high levels of gov- ernment has maintained an overview and has any no- tion of the consistency of evidence. Though some authorities clearly are aware of strong individual cases, they appear to be able to rationalize them as isolated examples of puzzling events that pose no immediate threat. It is easier to file them away and forget about them, and avoid fueling the flames of popular interest by keeping them secret as much as possible. Several things come to mind concerning the Lammer and Lammer article about alleged military participa- tion in abduction events (MLLABS, by their acronym). Although it is always bothersome when people (scien- tists or otherwise) step far outside of their fields of expertise and theorize about complicated events, Dr. Lammer comes across as relatively reasonable com- pared to others who have particular axes to grind. Still, how much does a geophysicist and planetary astronomer know about human psychology and behav- ioral sciences? How does he judge which testimony to accept as credible? By my experience and knowledge, Dr. Lammer is quite accurate in regard to his factual \"data,\" though it is very soft data indeed in comparison to physical sci- ence data, and about stupid and indefensible CIA and MKULTRA mind control experiments on human be- ings. The latter lends an air of plausibility to his theory, and the former definitely is in need of explanation. As I told Dr. Lammer when he queried me during his re- search, I have also encountered the same kind of re- port among the 100-plus \"clients\" I have dealt with. The Lammer theory may ultimately prove to be a brilliant analysis, or an exercise in faulty logic and reasoning, I recognize it as an honest and sincere effort to understand puzzling events. A few things about his reasoning in this article bother me, I think he is too quick to discard alternative hy- potheses on the basis of what has to be considered in- adequate evidence. David Jacobs' view that aliens could be \"staging\" events and deliberately misleading us also is quite plausible, and I have considered it in my speculations. Since neither hypothesis is falsifiable, we are not exactly dealing with hard science here. We are only speculating, which is perfectly okay as long as we ad- mit that and don't claim that it is the one true answer. The statement is made that skepticism about MILABS exists because researchers \"...don't know good and competently investigated MILAB cases.\" Absolutely true. I don't; does he? How does one in- vestigate such cases at all, except by choosing who and what to believe without adequate evidence to verify anything. The statement is also made that cases in the MUFON-supported Abduction Transcription Project \"..support the MILAB hypothesis.\" I beg to differ. That is an inaccurate statement. That data base supports the fact that such reports are being made by abductees. It does not support any particular hypothesis. Another important point must be considered in trying to analyze the abduction phenomenon: For very good reasons, abductees band together for mu- tual support. Unfortunately, they \"swap yams\" in con- tagious fashion so that the \"data\" base becomes con- taminated. This is especially true in, say, the past 5-10 years during which reported details of abduction experiences have been widely transmitted in books, on popular talk shows, and in UFO documentaries. This makes the earlier, thoroughly investigated and documented cases all the more important as guideposts for interpretation. It used to be possible to use independently reported obscure details as signs of authenticity. For the most part, this is no longer true."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal May 1999 Page 21 ET1 & THE MENTAL ENVIRONMENT EXTRATERRESTRIAL INTELLIGENCE & THE MENTAL ENVI- RONMENT: TEN BIG IDEAS by Marshall Vian Summers is a new and provocative perspective on the alien presence and how we can prepare mentally and spiritually for our inevitable future. $5 plus $ 1 s/h.

Unusual skeleton The article and photographs of the diminutive human-like skeleton that were published in the March 1999 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal under the title \"The Alien,\" by your International Director, has cre- ated quite a stir in ufological circles and on the Internet via the \"chat rooms.\" Nowhere in the article did I claim that this was a skeleton of an extraterrestrial entity or creature. The possible similarity to a small grey was the basic rea- son for writing the preliminary report. If the skeleton turns out to be an ET, just imagine the implications to the UFO field. Since Bob Slaughter died on March 24, 1998, of cancer, I was unable to personally document or au- thenticate the claims that he made in his book titled Fossil Remains of Mythical Creatures. While returning from the Eleventh Annual Ozark UFO Conference in Eureka Springs, AR, I took the opportunity of spending the full day of April 14 in Ladonia, TX, interviewing people who knew Bob Slaughter personally and had first hand knowledge of the story behind the mysterious skeleton. As I promised, the readers of the MUFON UFO Journal will be the first to know the details behind this intriguing case. Since most of the Journal layout is done during the middle of the prior month of its issue date, my response article, due to the time factor, will be published in the June 1999 issue.
