Recently an additional witness has been located. First revealed by Colin Penno (former editor of the local newspaper, The Topanga Messenger), the wave put Topanga Canyon on the UFO map. On that night, calls reporting UFOs flooded the local police station. The first call came from a couple who said that they be- came uneasy after noticing that a glowing object was fol- lowing their car. \"Suddenly, it was over us; we lost control of the car and it lifted us up off the ground.\" A second couple also re- ported an object following their car. They got out and saw three \"...flying discs, high up in the canyon ... they were saucers, they were fol- lowing us above the car and we stopped to get out. We watched them and within three seconds, they were gone...\" A third call came from a canyon resident. \"My wife and I were woken up by a very bright light above our home coming in through the windows ... we went out- side to look at it... Damnedest thing I ever saw in my life.\" Yet another caller complained that he was chased down the road by UFOs. \"I'd say they tailgated me from above, but I couldn't see anything because it was so damned bright.\" While the police handled the above calls, the office of The Topanga Messenger newspaper received more re- ports. One witness, Dr. Murray Clarke, saw \"an intense yellow-white light... traveling south-to-north very fast in a horizontal path.\" Another witness who called The Topanga Messen- ger said, \"I saw a brilliant ray of light outside through my window... like nothing I'd ever seen.\" Having lived in Topanga Canyon for more than twenty years, I was able to locate additional witnesses to that night's events. One report came from a couple, Phillip and Mandy, About the Author Preston Dennett has served as a field investiga- tor for MUFON, is the author of three books, has written numerous articles, and has worked with \"Sightings,\" \"National Geographic Explorer,\" and \"Encounters.\" who were driving through the canyon around midnight on that night. As soon as they pulled off Entrada and on to the boulevard, they saw numerous objects in the sky. As Mandy says, \"Five or six huge bright lights moving at all different angles... We were followed halfway down the mountain... I thought they were helicopters except they were totally silent. These brilliant lights were just all over us as we were driving down the mountain.\" As they pulled up towards Top O'Topanga, the driver, Phillip, described \"three craft coming over the hill... they were craft. As a matter of fact, there seemed to be light- ing on the craft... my first impression was that they were flying saucers.\" I was also able to locate another couple who witnessed strange activity on that night. They live high on Saddle Peak-one of the tallest peaks in Topanga-and described numerous oval glowing objects that rose from below the ridge near the coast. Says Daniel, \"It was an oval... we kept trying to see what shape they were because they seemed just like a light moving... twice, one started out, it would stop, change at a ninety-degree angle: 'zoom-zoom-shew!' And it would move fast... there was a number of them. This went on for quite a while, in a kind of rhythmic way.\" The other witness, Katherine, says, \"Sometimes twenty of them would come. Sometimes we'd see four or five... but the lights were so bright they would call our attention away from the television to the porch. And there were so many of them.\" The witnesses eventually counted dozens of objects over a period of at least two hours. I was unable to locate any other witnesses to that night. However, with a total of thirteen adult witnesses reporting UFOs, it becomes difficult to deny that something very unusual happened on that night. The encounter of June 14, 1992, was listed in Timothy Good's book UFO Update as one of the outstanding UFO events of that year. The full story of what happened on that night is told in my book UFOs Over Topanga Canyon. However, since publication, I have received a number of new high quality reports. What isn't in the book is the following testimony. In case thirteen witnesses isn't amazing enough, I have recently located yet another witness to the events of June 14,1992. His report adds another piece of the puzzle to the mystery of that night. Bill Boshears is currently a resident of Ohio, and is the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 May 2001 MUFON UFO Journal host of the hugely popular radio program Sci-Zone. The program is syndicated across the United States and re- mains one of the largest weekend radio talk shows in the nation. So when I found out that Mr. Boshears was also a Topanga UFO witness, I couldn't have been more de- lighted. Boshears was also surprised to find that he wasn't the only witness to the amazing events of the night in ques- tion. On June 14,1992, Boshears had attended a birthday party in the San Fernando Valley. Around nine or ten o'clock in the evening, he and two passengers headed into Topanga Canyon. It was to be a night they would not soon forget. No sooner had they pulled onto the straight-a-way south of Top O'Topanga when Boshears saw a large oval ob- ject streak quickly across the sky, followed immediately by another. \"All of a sudden, I saw a streak of light,\" Boshears explained. \"Then I saw another streak of light to the north. It went up over the mountains, very high up. And at first I thought it was a rocket launch. It was very bright, and it literally lit up the sky to the point that it might be a firestorm or something. So I stopped, got out, and it got brighter. By that, I mean, you could literally see the shadow of the car on the ground as this thing played and moved over the canyon... it was almost like daylight.\" As Boshears stood next to his car, he tried to figure out what he was seeing. What looked like a gigantic straight bar of light hovering at about three-thousand feet was ejecting smaller glowing football-shaped objects which began to dart back and forth across the sky. \"I was not the only person to see this. There were several people that saw it. And I thought it might have been a dirigible because earlier I had seen a blimp, a Fuji blimp that was moving around over the ocean. Then I thought maybe Hollywood is making a movie. You have to think that to maintain stability. And for the next twenty minutes, I was looking straight up to the point that my neck started aching. And I literally laid down on the hood of the car and watched it for twenty minutes.\" Boshears and his two passengers watched as the long glowing object ejected smaller oval-shaped craft which maneuvered across the Topanga skyline. Says Boshears, \"First [there was] the light, then the objects and the lights going in and out of the object and around it. Silvery dish-shaped objects, lights changing col- ors, and it began to play in that area. And I say play, not that I could orchestrate it. The thing that I can relate it to most often, have you ever been to a fireworks display and you suddenly look around and you notice that you're looking up in the air, and when you look back down, the light from the fireworks has light all over the ground? You can see everything as bright as if it were day. I lay there for twenty minutes. \"And the people that were with me-we just couldn't talk. I mean, every time you'd go, 'Did you see that?' you didn't want to look to say anything. Everyone was going, 'Look at that! Here they come again!' You know what it put me in mind of? 'Close Encounters.' Do you remem- ber a scene in the movie when they're all on the hillside? And I thought, how ironic! because I am watching this, and seeing this.\" Boshears and his friends were awe-struck. The large glowing object just hung in place while as many as six or seven objects danced about in the sky. \"The lights came out of it, back and forth and then back to it, and then would hover in the distance and back... they'd move out, hover, and back. But in coming out, [they] couldn't make their mind up, and would go either left or right and then decide to go over here and stay, and travel toward Santa Monica and back.\" Boshears tried in vain to get his other passengers to exit the car, but they remained inside. They all talked about what was happening throughout the entire ordeal. Interestingly, they never used the word \"UFO\" during the entire experience. They said, \"Look at that! Look at that!\" \"Do you see that?\" \"Yeah.\" \"What is that?\" \"What does that look like to you?\" After fifteen minutes, the display ended and Boshears' passengers said, \"Let's go. Let's get out of here. Let's go- Strangely, they didn't even discuss the incident on the way home. As Boshears says, \"I didn't say anything about it to anyone else ... there was no comment. I think we were more startled, and then later on, saying, 'Did we really see that?'...It's easy to deny. You know what? It doesn't stop it from happening. I didn't talk about it. \"The next day, all my friends, we were talking. They said, 'Bill, what time did you get home last night?' I said, 'Well, I got home about, you know...' I sort of shuffled and passed it off. But the friends who were with me hap- pened to be at that same house+we're sitting on the patio talking. And we all looked at one another like, 'Are you going to tell them, or am I going to tell them?' And we just blew it off, let it go.\" For those who have already read VFOs Over Topanga Canyon, much should sound familiar. However, Boshears' testimony adds yet another piece of the puzzle to the strange mystery that surrounds the night of June 14,1992, bringing the total number of witnesses to an astounding sixteen. As can be seen, Boshears' testimony corroborates with the other accounts that evening. For whatever reason, the UFO activity did not stop that night, and continues to this day. The number of Topanga UFO witnesses has now risen to more than a hundred. The number one question remains: why Topanga?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal May 2001 PageS Is there a connection? Marilyn Monroe & UFOs By Donald R. Burleson, Ph.D. A great deal of controversy has always surrounded the death of actress Marilyn Monroe, which was re- portedly a suicide, and which supposedly occurred on Sunday, August 5,1962. Almost immediately, rumors began to circulate that Marilyn had actually been mur- dered, and that this was probably because of her en- tanglements with the Kennedy family. There may well be a lot more to it than that. For some time a CIA document dated August 3,1962 has been circulating, a document describing FBI wire- tapping of a conversation between reporter Dorothy Kilgallen and Marilyn Monroe's friend Howard Rothberg. According to the memo, the wiretaps reveal Rothberg's telling Kilgallen about Marilyn's keeping a \"diary of secrets,\" stemming from her romantic inter- ludes not only with President John Kennedy but also Attorney General Robert Kennedy. The memo quotes Rothberg as saying that Marilyn had \"secrets to tell,\" including \"the visit by the president at a secret air base for the purpose of inspecting things from outer space.\" Supposedly Marilyn also knew about JFK's plans to have Fidel Castro assassinated, and vari- ous other state secrets, and was threatening to hold a press conference and \"tell all.\" Several other things are intriguing about this docu- ment. For one thing, it says that Kilgallen was over- heard remarking that the \"tilings from space\" reference might stem from \"the New Mexico story in the late for- ties.\" The memo also mentions that Kilgallen, in the mid- fifties, \"learned of secret effort by US and UK govern- ments to identify the origins of crashed spacecraft, and dead bodies.\" (Kilgallen herself would die mysteriously a few years later.) The subject line of the memo, inter- estingly enough, carries a reference to Moon Dust, a project whose existence has been vigorously denied by government and military agencies for years, though docu- ments do exist showing that Project Moon Dust was established for the purpose of retrieving and examining extraterrestrial debris. Also, in routing data near the bottom, there would appear to be the characters \"-J-12\" preceded by some other characters that are not entirely clear. Is this a ref- erence to the ever-controversial MJ-12? It's hard to say, but not beyond the realm of possibility. Now, this CIA document has been reproduced in a number of places, including the Hesemann and Mantle book Beyond Roswell and, more recently, Donald H. 7U| â¢tw'wwtw'if-.ui^SeSSSl ua --J.1 u- uÂ» M.TT !â¢)*>. u Â«nu â¢a^f tf. uÂ«hb >lm u taraliu rumttva tte^ â¢ ' ' : ' ' ' ' ; . â¢>â¢ â¢Â»â¢ wui i , '..-;,; ;lÂ»~ M0M% tlvwfttaBHI U hofc r Â«1Â» t lull Â«aÂ« Mj'>Â«Â»aÂ»r. .

But there's something else on the document that is com- pletely invisible in those published reproductions. And that something is of immense importance. One day when I had the memo on a screen in my com- puter lab at Eastern New Mexico University/Roswell, Jane Shoemaker, a student worker in the lab, remarked that there appeared to be a kind of shadowing near the top, as if some- thing else were written there. At the time, none of us could see anything in particular in it, but I ran the memo through a number of image enhancement software treatments, and was able to bring out and read, or mostly read, the \"extra\" writing. Just below \"Central Intelligence Agency\" at the top there is a faint inscription reading \"Exhibit B,\" and between this and the Top Secret stamp there appears another faint in- scription reading, so far as it is visible, \"Gen. Schulgen In- telligence Col lection Memorandum 19-.\" Just below that one can faintly make out: \"This exhibit includes the Intelligence Collection Memorandum...\" A little further down there is the faint word \"Brig.\" and some other very fragmentary words including \"learning more about.\" These faint words are all in typescript."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Page 6 May 2001 MUFON UFO Journal Schulgen as a reference to Brigadier General George Schulgen, who in 1947 was Chief of the Air Intelligence Requirements Division of Army Air Corps Intelligence. He was the general who, five days after the Roswell crash, appealed to the FBI to help the Army Air Corps investigate UFO reports, the idea essentially being to dis- credit witnesses as \"communist sympathizers\" and the like. In the exchange of memos that followed, it became clear that the FBI would want to see any recovered UFO debris, something the military would not be prepared to let them do. And it is easily established that Schulgen, fora period of years, was up to his ears in UFO-related mat- ters. So here we have Schulgen's name impressed on the top of a CIA document that speaks about Marilyn Mon- roe, her \"diary of secrets,\" and \"things from outer space.\" Even if the extra writing near the top of the memo occurs only because someone thought it fitting to file such a CIA document in close association with Schulgen-related docu- ments, the implications are strong and clear. We now have more reason than ever to suspect that Marilyn's death may well have had a lot to do with what she had learned from John Kennedy about UFOs. It appears that she knew some truly dangerous things, and that diary of hers must have been dynamite. Oddly enough, Donald Wolfe, though he reproduces the CIA memo in an appendix to his book, does not go into the \"things from space\" angle in the book. But when one thinks about the Schulgen connection, which to my way of thinking rather plainly connects Marilyn's death to the UFO question, one reads a great deal of Wolfe's book with an enhanced sense of the ominous and the eerie. For example, he cites tapes from an audio surveillance of Marilyn's house revealing that Bobby Kennedy was there on the afternoon and evening of Saturday, Aug. 4 (the real date of Marilyn's death), and that the two of them were engaged in a frightful argument, with Bobby Kennedy screaming over and over again. \"Where the * * * * is it?\" in tones so frantic and screeching as to be almost unrecognizable. Clearly, he was looking for the diary. And one has to ask oneself: what could there have been in that diary so tremendously important and so sensitive as to send the Attorney General of the United States into frothing fits of uncontrollable shrieking? State secrets about Cuba? The fact that Marilyn slept with both Jack and Bobby Kennedy? Hardly. The real secret must have been something much more profound. This is especially clear when one reads the rest of the story of Marilyn's death, a revolting nightmare of rifled autopsy reports, stolen telephone records, death threats to investigative reporters, and a helicopter hovering near Marilyn's house that night while some woman screamed, \"You murderers! Are you satisfied now that she's dead?\" Author Donald Wolfe pulls no punches here: \"The evi- dence points to premeditated homicide. In the presence of Bobby Kennedy, she was injected with enough barbi- turate to kill fifteen people.\" And what could be important enough for high-ranking government officials to act that way? Marilyn's friend, screenwriter Jose Bolanos, spoke with Marilyn on the phone less than an hour before her death, and later would only remark that she had told him \"something shocking, something that will one day shock the whole world.\" With the \"Schulgen\" imprint on the Marilyn Monroe CIA memo, and with what it implies about the UFO con- nection, I think we can make some very reasonable specu- lations about what Marilyn had to tell that could have been so \"shocking.\" One could argue, of course, that maybe the CIA memo isn't genuine, but it certainly has every appearance of be- ing so, and the fact that the \"Schulgen\" imprint is invisible on printed versions of the memo but visible when one does computer enhancements, makes it all the more likely that the memo is real. So, a reasonable hypothesis? President John Kennedy, in moments of intimacy, told Marilyn not only about such things as Cuba, but about UFO crashes and retrievals as well. And when she threatened to open her \"diary of se- crets\" to the press and \"tell all,\" it was her undoing, be- cause the secrets she was threatening to reveal were the most significant secrets in all of human history. Such things have long been speculated about, but the Schulgen con- nection makes this theory all the more plausible. Did Marilyn Monroe die because of Roswell? Could be. Stranger things have happened."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal May 2001 Page 7 Appeal to spiritual personages works in resisting abductions ByAnnDruffel Defense techniques represent a totally new aspect in the abduction field, but attempts to start a dialogue in the abduction field with certain high-profile researchers who contend that resistance is impossible or inadvisable have met with no success. In my recently-published book, How to Defend Your- self Against Alien Abduction 1 , nine mental and physical techniques are described, which many abductees have used to end traumatizing visits by so-called UFO entities. I have come to think that the specific technique I term \"Appeal to Spiritual Personages\" may be causing re- searchers like Mack, Hopkins, and Jacobs to dismiss the \"defense\" idea. Since many equally-qualified research- ers such as Bert Schwarz, M.D., Raymond Fowler, Philip Mantle, Donna Higbee, Irina Froning and others under- stand the value of \"experiencers\" having access to tech- niques that can free them (at least temporarily) from trauma induced by the abducting phenomenon, I became curious about those researchers who dismiss this aspect. Could it be that researchers who dismiss the idea of \"defense\" are essentially humanists who do not believe in God, Heaven, and \"inhabitants of Heaven\" and that dis- cussion of this one technique (among nine) disturbs them? If this is the case, they would not be inclined to work with any abductee who tries to tell them that appealing to a favorite spiritual personage brings about the departure of the traumatizing creatures. Yet the idea of \"spiritual personages,\" in which the experiencers themselves have faith, gives abductees the self-confidence that seems to contribute to successful resistance. They may not have sufficient serf-esteem and self-confidence within themselves to believe that they can protect themselves from traumatic experiences, but they have faith that \"heavenly\" sources can provide protec- tion for them. The phenomenon may return another night, but if the same appeal is made by the experiencer, the \"entities\" backoff again. Eventually, if the experiencer continues to have faith in the spiritual personage they appeal to, the entities do quit coming, or come only rarely and are easily disposed of, according to reports given me by these experiencers. Many abductees who have been traumatized and/or abducted report that they have told the \"creatures\" to \"Go away\" while calling upon God, Allah, or other spiri- tual personages to protect them. In many cases, the crea- tures do depart, the \"experiencer\" returns to full waking consciousness, and the abduction scenario ends. Perhaps some researchers consider such experiencers \"over-reli- gious.\" But \"over-religious\" is not a term which should enter into this. A person either believes in God, or not. About the Author Ann Druffel has been studying the UFO phenom- enon for 44 years, working first with the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), then as a field investigator for MUFON and CUFOS. She co-authored with D. Scott Rogo Tijunga Canyon Contacts, and has prepared a com- prehensive biography detailing Dr. James E. McDonald's work. She will be one of the featured speakers at the MUFON Symposium in July. They either believe that saints, angels and the like can help them, or not. What does it matter to a humanist re- searcher if an experiencer uses \"appeal to spiritual per- sonages\" or not? If something works, use it. Still, humanist abduction researchers continue to dis- miss accounts of successful resistance, even though the data are growing. The number of resisters in my own database grows monthly, and cases are being reported in the UFO literature and on the Internet. Even though hu- manist researchers may not \"believe\" the accounts of resisters, they should be willing to consider the psycho- logical implications of resistance. They should respect the fact that these experiencers' own psychological makeup allows them to believe that they can chase off intrusive entities and, furthermore, that they as human beings are allowed to chase them off. Most resisters, also, do not think the abducting \"creatures\" are technologically superior extraterrestrials, but, rather, some otherworldly \"order of being\" that has no real right to harass human beings. Another basic fact is that these intrusions occur in an altered state of consciousness, and that, at best, these creatures are only temporily physical in the earth plane. The vast majority of objective researchers, humanist or not, have come to this conclusion. John Mack, for instance, writes about the \"Trickster\" whom some shamans be- lieve embroils mankind in its badgering machinations. The evidence that the altered state in which abductions seem to occur is probably akin to shamanic trance is growing, and the findings of John Mack in particular have proved valuable in understanding the abduction phenomenon. However, when writing of \"spiritual\" beings contacted by shamans in this altered state, Mack seems to make no distinction between the \"Trickster\" and \"higher types of beings\" which shamans describe as consistently benevo- lent. This distinction must be made if the theory of \"shamanic trance\" is to benefit our field. For the \"Trick- ster\" realm seems akin to the concepts of \"jinns,\" \"Sidhe,\" \"Bunians,\" and a multitude of other otherworldly, abduct- ing creatures described in historical, philosophical, reli- gious, and folkloric texts in numerous world cultures. On the other hand, the spiritual realm is not simply otherworldly, non-physical creatures as described by"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PageS May 2001 MUFON UFO Journal Mack. Traditionally, the term \"spiritual\" means \"higher orders of creation\" as described in historical, philosophi- cal and religious texts. In these world writings, they are described as essentially benevolent toward mankind. They are never described as deceptive, harassing abductors. It should be emphasized that the definition of \"spiritu- ality\" as defined by Mack in his Passport to the Cosmos differs widely from the idea of \"spirituality\" held by more than two-thirds of the world's population. In the absence of scientific proof of God and a heav- enly realm inhabited by truly benevolent creatures, we need to determine personality traits of successful resist- ers as contrasted to those who do not resist. If these could be determined, it might clarify the abduction phenomenon significantly. Already, twelve years of research indicate that their personalities differ in significant ways. Early on in my study, it seemed that the level of an individual's self-esteem or their level of self- confidence is at work here. As noted above, the individual's confi- dence need not necessarily spring from their own mind. Resisters who depended on \"spiritual personages\" of their own choosing, for example, feel protected because they believe a \"higher power\" is helping them. The reader might ask: What is the difference between self-esteem and self-confidence? A wise colleague, Dor- othy Shapiro, has suggested that self-esteem is earned and that self-confidence is the personality trait which en- ables a person to earn it. It is important to point out here that Budd Hopkins' continuing research indicates that abductees he works with seem to have a diminished level of self-esteem. On the other hand, many resisters' self-esteem seems sufficiently high to give them a firm conviction that they have an inherent right to privacy and that they can de- mand to be left alone. In some cases, this confidence comes from having knowledge of techniques that they have instinctively, and successfully, used in the past. Or they gain a sufficient level of confidence from having friends or family members describe resistance techniques. It is in this particular situation that researchers can impart a valuable gift to traumatized abductees who come to them for help. They can tell them of the nine simple mental and physical techniques which have worked for others and suggest they try them. What would be gained? Most abductees need assurance that human beings are not helpless against the abducting phenomenon. Confi- dence will build as the technique begins to work. If one resistance technique doesn't seem to work too well, oth- ers can be tried. Regretfully, this is not being done by most researchers in the abduction field because of the common, but totally unproven, assumption that the \"abductors\" are superior to us. Above all, it should be stressed that a combination of techniques should be ready at hand, for very often a variety of resistance techniques need to be used in com- bination. This is because the abducting phenomenon (whatever it is) is very strong and also deceptive. All re- searchers seem to agree on this. If the human being it chooses to traumatize decides to fight the entity, it can alter its approach, sometimes pre- senting a more pleasing shape, sometimes a more fright- ening one. This is one of the crucial points which experiencers need to know: i.e., the \"alien\" presents it- self in whatever form it thinks necessary. This fact of \"shapeshifting\" is commonly reported, but has apparently been disregarded by some researchers, and by most abductees. Thoroughly deceived by the phe- nomenon, they assume that the \"alien\" appears as it actu- ally is in its own world. As a consequence, there are re- ports of various types of \"aliens\" coming from different sources, and these reports are taken as truth by many without any scientific validation. Some cases have come to light which demonstrate this shapeshifting aspect. One case discussed some years ago in the literature concerned a young male abductee who recalled being taken down to an apparent underground base where members of the U. S. military seemed to be working with \"aliens.\" He noticed that something was not quite right with the uniform of one of the \"U. S. mili- tary men\" standing near him. From his own experience he knew precisely how that particular uniform should look. As soon as the question came into his mind, the uniform shifted to meet his expectations. In my book How to Defend Yourself I discussed the case of Melissa MacLeod, who used Mental Struggle ini- tially against invisible \"presences\" who terrorized her at night. She later instinctively appealed to God when a black- robed entitiy woke her in the middle of the night, standing silently at her bedside. The altered state in which she saw it broke immediately. As invisible creatures continued to terrorize her at night, she shifted her appeals to the Arch- angel Michael. Mental calls for help to St. Michael worked much faster than Mental Struggle, and the visits decreased in frequency. Two years ago, Melissa determined to rid herself once and for all from the visits. She obtained an eight-inch high statue of St. Michael and placed it by her bedside on a bookcase.

Connecticut UFOs HAMDEN - The witness returned from shopping on March 20, 2001, when her eight-year-old son, who was in the car, pointed up to a large bullet-shaped object at 4:00 P.M. \"We got out of the car to watch a thick stream of pink- ish smoke or (gas) rise vertically George * iler on the horizon,\" she said. \"A few seconds later we saw a large bullet-shaped flying object. It was very shiny and silver with one circular ring around its middle. \"The craft started to rise vertically. We had great diffi- culty in not paying attention to it. I did not seek the atten- tion of any other people in the lot. It flew to altitude and then flew horizontally to the left of us. There were no flashing lights or sounds to be heard. We then got in the car to follow as best we could in the direction it was headed. We traveled approximately one-tenth of a mile to see only a grayish line of smoke or gas in the sky.\" Peter Davenport spoke with this witness, and found her story rather interesting. We do not know what she saw, but the case is now in the hands of MUFON/CT for investigation. HAMDEN â Two hours later, at 6:00 P.M., another Hamden woman reported that her son heard a very loud propeller sound over their house. He ran to the bay win- dow, where he said he saw a large missile-shaped object which was hovering just above the treeline. He was quite certain that the object was oblong, with two lights shining in an alternating fashion, one blue, the other red, and that the object was green and black. HARTFORD - Two days later, on March 22,2001, at 4:30 A.M., a couple living on a residential street in the state capital of Connecticut \"were awakened by a light that lit up the entire house.

As I was driving back home I noticed a very large craft of some kind fly- ing relatively low in the sky. It was about the size of an audio tape long-wise, at arm's length. \"I saw two lights, at first thinking that it was two air- planes flying side by side in unison. Then I realized it was one large object when I saw a small red light beside the far right light. As the object went out of view behind some trees, I followed in my car for about a minute and caught a better look from the rear. \"It was three lights in a line, with the small red light just a bit lower to the right. As I watched the object trying to see if there was any discernible shape to it, I noticed that there was absolutely no noise coming from it. I live in an area between Reagan National and Dulles International Airport and am familiar with the types of planes and heli- copters that fly in this area. For any plane to have been that size in my field of view, it would have been making a recognizable deep rumble sound. \"This object was higher up in the sky and was bigger that anything I have ever seen fly anywhere. It seemed to glide though the sky heading south when it went out of view. I was surprised that nobody else saw this in my area, given its large population. Whatever it was, I think it was intended for people to see it since it was so large and flying so low.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport Director A HREF=\"http:/ /www.ufocenter.com/\">NUFORC/A Florida fisherman reports sighting DESTTN â \"This happened a while back when I was shark fishing late one night about two miles off the East jetty,\" says the witness. \"I saw a small greenish-colored light on the horizon.

When it was about a mile out from me parallel to the shore, it suddenly just stopped and stayed in one spot. \"After a few minutes, it suddenly shot straight up into the air faster than I have ever seen anything move. It shot up 2000 feet and just stopped again. I went to get my camera out of the cabin, but when I came back I did not see it.

There is no way a plane can travel that fast and that far in only 15 seconds. \"I watched for half an hour as it seemed to play leap frog with me. It would shoot up and over me, back and forth from one side to the other. Sometimes it moved so fast that the light would look like a blur moving across the sky. I spent a lot of time commercial fishing, and some of the things we saw out over the Gulf were downright weird. I asked my father if he knew what they were and all he said was, 'I hope that Eglin Air Force Base is testing something.' \"I saw something similar about 100 miles off the coast one January night at 3:00 AM. I was up in the bridge of my dad's boat when I saw the light. I looked at the radar to see if it was a boat on the horizon. There was a small blip on the screen that disappeared from the radar and reappeared behind us. I looked out the cabin door and there was the light behind us that played leap frog for about 30 minutes before it disappeared. Numerous times fishing out there we saw lights in the sky doing strange things.\" Cylinder shape in Ohio CANTON â The witness was casually observing the starlit night sky outside while at work on March 24,2001. He observed 3 or 4 airplanes in the night sky at 8:50 P.M. \"A regional airport is five minutes from my observation point,\" he explains. \"I observed two faintly visible, white, dim, non-blinking lights moving to the east-northeast at what I thought was an impossible rate of speed for even a military jet. \"It was a fairly long object with one dim, non-blinking light forward and one dun, non-blinking light at the rear. No wing lights were visible, although between the front and rear lights a very slight dim, white illumination seemed barely noticeable along the edges of its body. The object was at about 60 degrees from my vantage point and cov- ered about two-thirds of the sky within five seconds or so. \"Suddenly the object slowed down so very rapidly it barely seemed possible. It seemed to just 'coast' slowly for a second and it then just vanished. Although sounds from the nearby airplanes could be heard, when the ob- ject I saw darted across the sky, I thought I could hear a faint, steady sound like a hum of some sort, but unlike that of an airplane or jet engine.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport Director of the National UFO Reporting Center. California chevron reported over witnesses GRANITE BAY â \"While driving home on March 24,2001, we saw a very white bright point of light up in the sky, and realized that it was coming towards us,\" says one of the witnesses. \"The object had seven or eight bunk- ing lights on the side. As we got closer at 1:24 A.M., it became apparent that it was either close to the ground or very large. There were seven lights on the front in a chev- ron formation. An eighth white, blinking light was in the back, located two inches from the front most light in the front. \"The front lights were various sizes of circles with a red light at the 'nose' of the object. The size of the circles were in no apparent order, but were symmetrical in place- ment, i.e., a medium was across from a medium, and a large light was across from a large light. \"Once the object moved over die road, it slowed down to a nearly complete stop and shot out what looked like a faint spot light on the shoulder of the road at an angle of about 45 degrees from either the center or one side of the chevron. After the spotlight went out, the craft sped up, crossed the road diagonally, and continued to move away from us. \"I phoned my friend to tell him to get outside and see if he could get a look. Thirty seconds later I spotted another object shaped like a classic saucer. Sort of cigar, but more saucer-shaped. It was moving over a field in the distance, complete with blinking lights. It stopped and started and followed the first object. My friend thinks it was a heli- copter, but I haven't seen helicopters with that many lights. I was very excited yelling into the phone. I couldn't shut up about it, while my friend didn't say much. I kept asking him if he had seen that first one shoot out the spotlight, and he would say, 'Yea, he thought so.'\" Thanks to A HREF=\"http://www.ufocenter.com/\"NUFORC /A Red UFO appears to land in Australia QUEENSLAND â A woman rancher says she saw a glowing red UFO land in a paddock close to Beenliegh and Redland Bay Road near Logan the night of March 28, 2001.

Moreover, there was hardly any uniqueness to the human genes. They are comparative to 99 percent of the chimpanzees, and 70 percent of the mouse. Hu- man genes, with the same functions, were found to be identical to genes of other vertebrates, as well as inverte- brates, plants, fungi, even yeast. \"The findings not only confirmed that there was one source of DNA for all life on Earth, but also enabled the scientists to trace the evolutionary process-how more com- plex organisms evolved, genetically, from simpler ones, adopting at each stage the genes of a lower life form to create a more complex higher life form-culminating with Homo sapiens. It was here, in tracing the vertical evolutionary record contained in the human and the other analyzed genomes, that the scientists ran into an enigma. \"The 'head-scratching discovery by the public consor- tium,' as Science termed it, was that the human genome contains 223 genes that do not have the required prede- cessors on the genomic evolutionary tree. How did Man acquire such a bunch of enigmatic genes? \"In the evolutionary progression from bacteria to in- vertebrates (such as the lineages of yeast, worms, flies or mustard weed - which have been deciphered) to verte- brates (mice, chimpanzees) and finally modern humans, these 223 genes are completely missing in the inverte- brate phase. Therefore, the scientists can explain their presence in the human genome by a 'rather recent' (in evolutionary time scales) 'probable horizontal transfer from bacteria.' \"In other words: at a relatively recent time as Evolu- tion goes, modern humans acquired an extra 223 genes not through gradual evolution, not vertically on the Tree of Life, but horizontally, as a sideways insertion of ge- netic material from bacteria. \"Now, at first glance it would seem that 223 genes is no big deal. In fact, while every single gene makes a great difference to every individual, 223 genes make an im- mense difference to a species such as ours. The human genome is made up of about three billion neucleotides (the \"letters\" A-C-G-T which stand for the initials of the four nucleic acids that spell out all life on Earth); of them, just a little more than one percent are grouped into func- tioning genes (each gene consists of thousands of \"let- ters\"). \"The difference between one individual person and an- other amounts to about one \"letter\" in a thousand in the DNA \"alphabet.\" The difference between Man and Chim- panzee is less than one percent as genes go; and one percent of 30,000 genes is 300. So, 223 genes is more than two-thirds of the difference between me, you and a chimpanzee. \"An analysis of the functions of these genes through the proteins that they spell out, conducted by the Public Consortium team and published in the journal Nature, shows that they include not only proteins involved in im- portant physiological but also psychiatric functions. \"Moreover, they are responsible for important neuro- logical enzymes that stem only from the mitochondrial portion of the DNA-the so-called 'Eve' DNA that hu- mankind inherited only through the mother-line, all the way back to a single 'Eve.' That finding alone raises doubt regarding the 'bacterial insertion' explanation.\" Sitchin continues, \"The Role of the Anunnaki Readers of my books must be smiling by now, for they know the answer. They know that the biblical verses dealing with the fashioning of The Adam are condensed renderings of much much more detailed Sumerian and Akkadian texts, found inscribed on clay tablets, in which the role of the Elohim in \"Genesis\" is performed by the Anunnaki- \"Those Who From Heaven to Earth Came.\" \"As detailed in my books, beginning with The 12th Planet (1976) and even more so in Genesis Revisited and The Cosmic Code, the Anunnaki came to Earth some 450,000 years ago from the planet Nibiru-a member of our own solar system whose great orbit brings it to our part of the heavens once every 3,600 years. \"They came here in need of gold, with which to pro-"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Page 12 May 2001 MUFON UFO Journal tect their dwindling atmosphere. Exhausted and in need of help in mining the gold, their chief scientist Enki sug- gested that they use their genetic knowledge to create the needed Primitive Workers. When the other leaders of the Anunnaki asked: How can you create a new being? He answered: \"The being that we need already exists; all that we have to do is put our mark on it.' The time was some 300,000 years ago. \"What he had in mind was to upgrade genetically the existing hominids, who were already on Earth through Evolution, by adding some of the genes of the more ad- vanced Anunnaki. That the Anunnaki, who could already travel in space 450,000 years ago, possessed the genomic science (whose threshold we have now reached) is clear not only from the actual texts, but also from numerous depictions in which the double-helix of the DNA is ren- dered as Entwined Serpents and often depicted in Sumarian drawings (a symbol still used for medicine and hearing) \"When the leaders of the Anunnaki approved the project (as echoed in the biblical 'Let us fashion the Adam'), Enki with the help of Ninharsag, the Chief Medi- cal Officer of the Anunnaki, embarked on a process of genetic engineering, by adding and combining genes of the Anunnaki with those of the already-existing hominids. \"When, after much trial and error breathtakingly de- scribed and recorded in antiquity, a 'perfect model' was attained, Ninharsag held him up and shouted: 'My hands have made it!' An ancient artist depicted the scene on a cylinder sea. And that, I suggest, is how we had come to possess the unique extra genes. \"It was in the image of the Anunnaki, not of bacteria, that Adam and Eve were fashioned. Unless further sci- entific research can establish, beyond any doubt, that the only possible source of the extra genes are indeed bacte- ria, and unless it is then also determined that the infection (\"horizontal transfer\") went from bacteria to Man and not from Man to bacteria, the only other available solution will be that offered by the Sumerian texts millennia ago. \"Until then, the enigmatic 223 alien genes will remain as an alternative-and as a corroboration by modern sci- ence of the Anunnaki and their genetic feats on Earth.\" Thanks to ZECHARIA SITCHIN (c) Z.

In 1965 1 wrote to Margaret Chase Smith to verify whether George Adamski had visited her and whether she had introduced him to other members of the Commit- tee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences, as some of his supporters believed. Her reply, characteristically direct, courteous, and politically correct, was as follows: Dear Mr. Sherwood:        ; I never introduced Mr. Adamski to any members of the Senate, and I never expressed my serf on his record or gave him any endorsement, and I never read any state- ment of his into the Congressional Record. You have been misinformed.      ; He and others asked to see me in my office and I granted their request and listened to them. 1 made no comment one way or the other as to the validity of their assertions. Sincerely yours, Margaret Chase Smith United States Senator -William T. Sherwood Original exposure As always, Dick Hall's \"Perspective\" column in the April JOURNAL was most interesting, informative, and thought provoking. As for the latter, among others, it provoked these in my mind: First, Hall refers to the \"recent 'revival\" of George Adamski.\" What revival? Is he referring to Tim Good's continuing apologia or, perhaps, Colin Bennett's long ar- ticle in THE ANOMALIST (#8, Spring 2000) about Adamski's 1959 world tour? I hope Dick will enlighten us in a future column. If there is an Adamski revival going on, the more con- temporary ufology is informed about the old fraud the better. There aren't many old timers like Hall and myself left who remember the facts from being around back then. Second, speaking of old timers, I was disappointed Dick didn't give credit to the person who first unmasked Adamski for the phony he was, vigorously pursuing the truth from those who allegedly witnessed the 1952 desert chat between \"the Professor\" and Space Brother Orthon, supposedly snapped a confirming photo of a Venusian scout ship, etc. This, of course, is James Moseley, editor and publisher of SAUCER SMEAR and one of ufology's most interesting and controversial figures since the early fifties. The expose first appeared in the January 1955 issue of Jim's NEXUS (later SAUCER NEWS and finally trans- muted into today's SMEAR). There were follow-up sto- ries, and everything was compiled in a special October 1957 issue of SN.

He says, \"Ufologists have not connected with the sci- entific community.\" I have, over the 34 years since I be- gan speaking and writing about UFOs, made many con- nections with the scientific community. There have been lectures at Engineering Societies of Detroit, Cincinnati, Baltimore, the Los Alamos National Laboratory (twice), Gulf Research Labs; National Management Association ; Chapters at 5 different Lockheed groups, McDonnell Douglas, North American Rockwell, General Dynamics, Motorola, etc; half a dozen sections of the American In- stitute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and of the Insti- tute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers; the Engineer- ing Alumni Association at Harvard, etc. Within the past year I have spoken to the Association of Professional Engineers of New Brunswick, as well as the Association of Professional Engineers of Prince Ed- ward Island. At many of my college and University pro- grams I also meet with science classes, physics semi- nars.

Ron says \"We don't see any continuity between what the SETI Community is trying to do and what we are doing.

I debated him on the Jeff Rense radio show and had correspondence after that. I published a rejoinder to Carl Sagan's Scientific American article \"The Search for ET Life\" in Houston Sky. An article the \"Pseudoscience of Antiufology\" in Pursuit deals with Sagan's views. I insti- gated Terence Dickinson's article about the Zeta Reticuli Incident inASTRONOMY Perhaps it needs to be noted that the scientific com- munity consists of far more than the academic world.

Dr. Bruce Maccabee has published in the/, of Optical Sciences, Dr. Robert Wood was heavily involved with AIAA groups. At every opportunity I try to engage scientists in the class- room, on radio and TV and in correspondence. More than 700 lectures dealing with flying saucers should certainly demonstrate that. I think part of the problem may be that not enough academic ufologists pay attention to what non academics are doing. Jim McDonald's work was certainly main- stream. He did a lot more than take his lumps for his UFO work at the Congressional SST hearings. He reached out and spoke to many professional groups. Ron says, \"We have not tried to put the work we do in the context of the mainstream scientific literature.\" My publications noted above are loaded with references. It is the SETI Cultists who don't mention the UFO literature, not the other way around. Sagan in \"Demon Haunted World\" has as his primary source of UFO info the tabloid \"Weekly World News\" and doesn't even refer to \"UFOs? A Scientific Debate\" which he edited and was published by Cornell University Press.

California woman observes semi-transparent triangles Reported by Virgil C. Staff Western Regional Director In recent years, there have been numerous reports of UFOs in the region of Sebastopol, CA. Jo Ellen Kelly lives in Sebastopol, and on Aug. 22 and 23, between 12:00 and 13:00 hours, she sighted a number of unusual con- figurations crossing the sky above her home. These \"objects\" typically drifted in a straight-line path from south to north, or west to east, although she has watched them move from east to west, or from north to south. With the naked eye, they have appeared to be \"white elliptical things,\" and she initially concluded they might be birds. But unlike birds, she noted that they drifted in straight lines. Jo Ellen reports that she first believed them to be seagulls and balloons, \"but I found out they fly higher than seagulls, especially when I saw a couple of seagulls fly- ing one-half the altitude these triangles were flying.\" She usually watched them from her back porch, where she studied them intently on Aug. 22 and 23. But she has watched them at other times, and noted that they occasionally stop, hover, and ascend or descend. She first viewed them at 45 degrees elevation, and lost sight of them at 90 degrees when the overhang of the roof blocked off any further view. She has no idea of their size or height, but notes that they traveled through the clear sky from 45 degrees elevation to 90 degrees in approximately six seconds. Employing 7x35 binoculars she noted that what had, by the naked eye, seemed to be approximately five times larger than a star, now became what she believed to be essentially the size of an airplane. Each configuration now took a \"white, fluffy outline, semi-transparent triangle shape\" that was sky blue in the center. On both days, she observed six of these triangular shapes follow each other at approximately five minutes apart. Direction of wind speed at this time is unknown, but was recorded as about 10 miles per hour. Direction of flight was from south to north. These incidents are of some interest since there have been occasional discussions concerning unusual flying phenomena where blue sky was reportedly seen within the perimeters.

Secondly, Burleson notes that pictures shot during this time period are more likely to be authentic, since today's sophisticated technology which can be used for hoaxing photos was not available then. The major case dealt with is the Ramey \"memo,\" a topic familiar to Journal readers through Burleson's timely articles as he reports' on his utilization of special computer software to enhance and decipher the images. He refers to this letter or memo as \"a smoking gun i f ever we hoped to see one,\" adding, \"Essentially, for those with eyes to see the truth, the cover-up is over.\" Included with the detailed analysis are representative images. Burleson also enhanced the photos shot at Phoenix, AZ, on July 7,1947, by William A. Rhodes, which Burleson calls \"one of the finest UFO photos ever taken, if not the finest.\" He notes that the heel-shaped object \"with evi- dence of something like a canopy on top,\" is \"in ah 1 liklihood highly similar, even possibly identical, to the craft that crashed near Roswell.\" According to Burleson, Kenneth Arnold looked at the Rhodes photos and \"commented that the pictured objects were identical in form to the nine objects he had seen near Mr. Rainier\" in his famous sight- ing. The Great Falls, MT, spots of light turned into what appear to be spinning round objects under Burleson's en- hancement techniques. The photographer, Nick Mariana, had earlier taken close-up motion pictures of the object, according to his son, but this section of his movie film was not returned by Air Force investigators, who labeled the objects as F-94's. The Lubbock, Texas, lights were reported by several reliable observers, and photographed by Carl Hart on Aug. 31,1951. Burleson's enhancement techniques show the wing formation of 18 lights to be round with a \"beehive\" hexagonal cellular structure on the underbelly. Accord- ing to the author, this corroborates with the memory of \"Roswell crash retrieval witness Frank Kaufmann, who told me when I interviewed him on Sept. 14,1999, and showed him my enhancement of one of the Lubbock ob- jects that the 'hex' cells were what he remembered.\" The Tremonton, UT, 45-second 16mm footage shot by Navy Warrant Officer Delbert Newhouse on July 2,1952, shows objects that flew high arid fast, and moved inde- pendently of each other. Burleson's computer analysis indicates \"a disk-shaped and probably spinning craft.\" The Robertson Panel and Condon Committee claimed the ob- jects were seagulls riding a thermal air current. Dr. Burleson has utilized modern computer technology well, and this little book would be a nice addition to every ufologist's library-as well as an appropriate gift. Unearthly Disclosure by Timothy Good, Century, Random House Group Limited, 20 Vauxhall Bridge Road, London SWIV 2SA, 2000, hardback, 6X9, 287 pages, 16.99 British pounds (not available in U.S.). Reviewed by Dwight Connelly Whether or not one likes this book depends on the per- spective of the reader. Those who enjoy entertaining sto- ries and accept all manner of interesting contactee ac- counts should enjoy it. Those interested in a more \"nuts and bolts\" style of reporting in which compelling evidence is emphasized will be disappointed. In the Foreward, Lord Hill-Norton, former Chief of Defence Staff and Chairman of the NATO Military Com- mittee, states, \"Readers [new to the field or experienced] cannot fail to be impressed-as I was-that virtually every incident reported by the author is corroborated by more than one independent witness.\" Unfortunately, most of Good's accounts in Unearthly Disclosure fail to meet this standard. Nearly a quarter (seventy pages) of this 287-page book are devoted to a questionable 1993 case from Italy in- volving photos of an alleged strange creature with some human-like attributes-a case which the photographer at one point admitted was a hoax, then changed his mind."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Page 16 May 2001 MUFON UFO Journal He seems to have the means (professional painter and ceramics artisan) to have created the \"creature\" to be photographed, plus the motive (he sold his photos to the highest bidder), yet Good feels the case is worth a signifi- cant portion of this book. Good did travel to Italy and attempted to determine if the case was indeed a hoax, but the results were incon- clusive. There were two additional witnesses, including the photographer's grandmother, who in the photographer's own words \"was still sleepy and her sight wasn't so good,\" and the photographer's father, who reportedly had a fleeting look at what may have been the creature-or may have been his imagina- tion. Despite the length of this account, the author does not directly quote either wit- ness, except indirectly through the photog- rapher. It is also surprising that the pho- tographer depended on nothing except a Polaroid camera to record his alleged in- teractions with this creature, despite the fact that they supposedly occurred over a significant period of time and would have made excellent video footage-if real. Good seems to find support for this case by noting that two white \"tubes\" protruding from the creature are simi- lar to a 1995 case in Puerto Rico, suggesting that this tends to corroborate the 1993 photos. But he does not describe the 1995 Puerto Rican case, despite the fact that he was in Puerto Rico gathering information on other cases, nor does he entertain the possibility that the Puerto Rico report may have been generated by the 1993 Italian case. An additional 47 pages of Unearthly Disclosure are devoted to Enrique Castillo Rincon, who spins an undocu- mented story of contact with entities which allegedly be- gan in 1963. The account is interesting, but could just as well be fiction as fact. There are no additional witnesses to this report. Then there are the 11 pages devoted to Julio Fernandez, who in 1978 reportedly had contact with entities and was supposedly (with his dog) taken on board a craft. The author bases this account on a hypnosis of the witness, as reported by Spanish investigator and author Antonio Ribera, and as translated by Gordon Creighton. Fernandez died in an auto accident in 1992, so Good could not ques- tion him directly. Again, no independent witnesses, no information on the hypnosis, and no additional evidence. Another 12 pages are devoted to an account from an unnamed \"senior reporter\" who supposedly has access to an unnamed \"senior Air Force officer\" as a source of information about alien bases on Earth and bodies from crashes. Again, documentation is lacking, and Good ad- mits that the material may be disinformation. There is a great deal of material related to Puerto Rico (\"Island of Enchantment\"), and Good personally talked to some of the witnesses. However, he seems to have placed a good deal of reliance on Jorge Martin, a veteran re- searcher and prolific writer on the island, in making con- tact and in talking with Spanish-speaking witnesses. Martin has a mixed reputation as a researcher, and if there are indeed as many strange occurrences in Puerto Rico as are reported by him, it has to be the hot spot of the world (some people do have that opinion). To Good's credit he checks out some information allegedly supplied by Martin's- supposedly secret sources, and in a couple of instances determines that the informa- tion appears to be unreliable. He also uti- lizes other sources in addition to Martin. Also included in Unearthly Disclosure is a chapter entitled \"Soul Vampires,\" which, despite the tide, told little about this topic. Good recounts the classic case of Kelly Cahill in Australia, which is an ex- cellent close encounter and probable ab- duction case, but which fits into \"soul vam- pires\" only because Kelly suggested that she felt the aliens might be more interested in her \"life force\" or soul than in her physical body. The Cahill case seems wasted in discussing only the \"soul vampires\" angle, since it is far superior to most of the other cases in this book, and the available drawings and photos which would have added so much to the cred- ibility of the Cahill case are absent. Good does include the very interesting case of the dis- appearance in 1980 of two pilots while flying from the Dominican Republic to Puerto Rico. Although that event is more than 20 years old, Good publishes for the first time portions of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) accident report obtained by Graham Sheppard, Good's principal research associate. This report details the Mayday transmission of the pi- lot of the Ercoupe: \"...a weird object in our course that made us change course about three different times, we got it right now in front of us at 1 o'clock, our heading is 070 degrees.\" Contact was lost with the light aircraft, which was never located, much as in the Australian case involving Frederick Valentich in 1978. Another situation involving aircraft reported by Good is the strange and interesting \"lateral displacement\" re- portedly experienced in Puerto Rico by his researcher, Sheppard, in March of 1993. Sheppard was attempting to fly from the Arecibo telescope to Mayaguez Airport, a relatively simple journey, but found himself unexplainably flying over the wrong coastline. Good also recounts the well-known sightings and pos-"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal May 200 i Page 17 sible capture of creatures in and around the city of Varginha, Brazil, in 1996, a case much better documented than the Italian report, and far more deserving of space in the book. Despite the generally poor choice and treatment of cases for this latest book, it is clear in talking with Good that he is an honest reporter of events as he sees them. He just seems never to meet a case or contactee he doesn't like. The Allies of Humanity-An Urgent Message About the Extraterrestrial Presence in the World Today, by Marshall Vian Summers.

Reviewed by Virgil Staff In a noteworthy article in the theMUFON UFO Jour- nal of February, 2001, Elaine Douglass ponders the ques- tion of \"what is the reason for the aliens' cover-up?\" This very question, answered and published by Marshall Vian Summers in the previous year, is known as The Al- lies of Humanity-An Urgent Message About the Ex- traterrestrial Presence in the World Today. In this reviewer's opinion, this is the most significant book on Ufology that has been published to date, and it will be ignored at great cost to ourselves and our civiliza- tion. The material of this document was channeled through Marshall with great sacrifice to his previous plans and economic expectations. The message is a powerful one, and should not be rejected because of the means by which it was received. Those who have studied the tomes of Hopkins, Jacobs, Strieber, and others will find little here that is inconsistent with the presentations of these authors. What the reader will find is a brilliant statement of why the aliens are here, what they want, their intentions for mankind and for the world, and how they are presently striving to achieve their goals. Marshall makes it clear that the aliens are here, and that the scope of their activities increases year by year. He acknowledges that our civilization, and our very souls, are in danger of what is coming on us. Those who believe that the aliens will bring nothing but sweetness and love tend to be terribly shaken by this information. It is against the grain, but it is so reasonable, and so in tune with pre- vious studies that these folk find difficulty emotionally in facing up to the real meaning of the UFO phenomenon. In a note to readers, Marshall writes: \"The source of information describe themselves as physical beings from other worlds who have gathered in our solar system near the earth for the purpose of observing the communica- tions and activities of those alien races who are here in EDITION BE ALLIES / i* HUMN1TY E*Â«fcTTÂ«lri*| C-râ¢ P. lUUJ U* M V Summers THE AUTHOR Ol Slept to Knowledge our world interfering in human affairs. The source refers to themselves as the 'Allies of Humanity.' The Allies' stated purpose is to alert us to the risks of emerging into a Greater Community of intelligent life and to assist us in successfully crossing this great threshold in such a way that human freedom and self-determination can be pre- served.\" He also states: \"If you can become informed, then fear is transformed into concern and concern is trans- formed into constructive action. We know of no other way to describe this.\" This is not a detailed record. Rather it is a positive and transformational mes- sage to make evident the purpose of the alien inter- vention. It is aimed at helping us to become aware of our challenges, and how they can be met. The Allies assure us that \"those who engage in space travel do not rep- resent the spiritually ad- vanced.\" In their contact with the earth, they participate in \"four fundamental ac- tivities in order to gain in- fluence in your world.\" These activities, described in con- siderable detail, are as follows: (1) the influencing of indi- viduals of great power and authority; (2) the \"manipula- tion of religious values and impulses\"; (3) the establish- ment of their presence here; and (4) the establishment of themselves through interbreeding. The re-education and pacification program is discussed in much detail, as are the means by which it renders earthlings helpless and unable to resist. But the message of the Allies is one of hope. It is most importantly a guide to preparing for the onslaught. Those who fail to study this material surely do so at their own risk.

On the one hand I had several people who contacted me to agree with the idea that we should consider a new type of conference that sets out to ask and answer spe- cific questions. I only hope that it proves possible to trans- late this enthusiasm into action. However, the other responses to my piece picked up on the attitude of British skeptics that I was describing in relation to car stop cases. How could they be so dismiss- ive on the basis of one (undisclosed) in- cident I was asked? And did I support this nonsense, Jenn y Randies because my own stance as regards to UFOs was not made clear. Some thought I was by inference supporting the denial of this UFO evidence. Perhaps a look at my perspective on UFO investiga- tions will provide some background. In a succeeding col- umn I will discuss some of my own conclusions. The ways of the UFOlogist There are four paths to UFO investigation that I have identified. (a) The way of the skeptic: With some this path is through reason and reduction. To them UFOlogy is best perceived as a series of logic puzzles to be solved. All cases will have answers. We simply have to find them. Very often skeptics follow this code because it is how they view life-and UFOs are merely a part of life to be judged in the same way. (b) The way of the scientist Others regard life as a quest for answers, whatever they may be and wherever they may lead. They are able to accept that not all things are soluble. Some cases may never be so within our lifetime. So UFOlogy becomes a quest that may lead to pre-existent knowledge or may lead us into the discovery of new knowledge. (c) The way of the witness: Witnesses, very often, are pushed a little further by virtue of the experience that they have had. They can skip the reductionist path and whilst they may give credit to the search for answers, deep down they will often feel, \"Well, I know this thing happened to me. I cannot hon- estly deny it. I respect the views of others who were not here. But I know what I saw and I know what the most likely explanation is.\" (d) The way of the mystic: There is even a fourth path that is actually stronger in the UK than I suspect it is in the US. This accepts the veracity of the experience, rejects as a total explanation the path of reduction and reason (although accepting its applicability to some cases), but then confronts the evi- dence as part of a broader context. Rather than say, \"Yes, UFOs are real; where do they come from?\" this approach is fascinated by the human dimension. It sees a close encounter as an experience that happens \"to\" a witness, rather than an event that is observed \"by\" them. It seeks links with what we might call psychic phenomena-notices patterns that see close encounters (for example) mirroring the NDE (near death experience) as well as clues that point towards UFO events sometimes occurring during altered states of con- sciousness. The quest for answers then becomes a personal cru- sade for spiritual enlightenment, of which the UFO phe- nomenon is simply apart. I suspect that all of you reading this will be able to place yourself into one of these approaches to the UFO mystery. None of them is right. None is wrong. All are viable ways of interpreting the data, and they are what they are because we as human beings are what we are. We need to show more tolerance for alternative view- points and accept that all methods have things to say, and that the ultimate truth could be a synthesis of parts of each. But I guess it would not be fair to avoid placing my self into this framework and explaining where I stand. It has been advantageous to think this matter through, because I have been able to apply elements of all four \"ways\" to my UFO investigation work. And I think that has benefited me. The way of the skeptic The way of the skeptic serves its purpose well during the early stages of any case investigation. I find that it genuinely helps to go into a case expecting to find a simple answer. About 95% of the time this expectation is vindi- cated. And focusing on the maxim-this case probably can be solved-aids in your necessary task of checking and double checking every option. You really can gain from studying the methods of the skeptic because in the real world explaining away a case is often what we as UFO investigators have to do. However, I find that the trick is knowing when to say that enough is enough. With hard line skeptics this meth- odology is flogged to death, and no case is left unstoned. They are so sure that the 95% can become 100% IFOs that no point will ever be reached where the balance of Xu"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal May 2001 Page 19 evidence seems to favor something other than a mun- dane answer. Not so for me. When you have battered at a case hard enough in search of an answer and no credible answer has emerged, it is time, in my view, to stop that approach and move on, for one of the three other ways to do UFOlogy will likely prove to be more effective. However, as a caveat, I would always remind that later (maybe many years later) a clue might emerge that will return you to the skeptical approach with a particular case. No case ever should be considered immune from pos- sible explanation, however unlikely that may seem. The way of the scientist But having moved on from the initial phase of rigorous skepticism, I often find that the way of the scientist is the next best step.     , I find that in this second phase of case study you can concentrate on two things: collating evidence broadly and looking for patterns and comparisons with other cases. You should never accept a case as \"over\" because you have \"solved\" it as a UFO. Terming a case a UFO is not a statement of success, for a UFO is still \"unidentified,\" and we must try to go beyond that if we possibly can. Collecting evidence as a scientist would in this next phase involves thinking beyond the norm-asking poten- tially relevant questions, such as were there any odd at- mospheric events that night? Did astronomers record any coincident anomalies? What if I surveyed the traffic po- lice? Would they have cameras on the highway that might have recorded this area of sky? Thevariations are end- less. The questions to ask differ from case to case. As for seeking out comparative cases, I often find this the best part of the scientific methodology, because by that approach I quite often dig up old cases from my own work or the work of others that seem very like the one under present scrutiny. It is by no means uncommon for these old cases to point towards new questions to ask, or new lines of enquiry to follow. The old case might even have been solved and thus kick you back into \"skeptical mode,\" looking anew at the possibility of an explanation that you had previously overlooked. Either way, too few UFO investigators pay attention to previous cases, and yet this is a rich treasure trove of resource material built up by UFOlogy. We owe it to those who came before us to not behave as if the world started anew when we became a UFOlogist. If you want those who follow to care about the evidence over which you are now sweating blood and tears then you should apply the same principle to those who peceded you. The way of the witness The third approach to UFOlogy-the way of the wit- ness-is not one that I follow quite so much. It is, of course, the hardest to apply because you cannot just become a witness simply when you would like to be. However, it has its part to play, even for the most hard bitten re- searcher. It is essential, for example, to familiarise yourself with what is visible in the sky. There are lots of things that people never see because they rarely look upwards at night. Practicising this, perhaps at the site where your current case has happened, is an excellent method to adopt from time to time-not so much in hope or expecta- tion of seeing the UFO coming back, but because sooner or later you will see something interesting by chance as a result of doing this. It might be a fireball meteor or an unusual aircraft or a space junk re-entry or a stellar mirage. I have seen three of these things simply by following this advice (as yet I havent seen a space junk burn up!) The big advantage of such an approach is that it places you in the frame of the witness. You now have seen something that others have not. They may well confront your story in the same way as you will confront a UFO witness. It is very important to get this personal insight of the other side of the fence, since it brings empathy and un- derstanding to those you must work with, and it instills an awareness of the power of actually seeing rather than merely believing/Moreover, on more than one occasion following the way of the witness has helped to solve a case. Because by being there in the same environment, the \"UFO\" just might return. And when in past cases it has, the investigator has been able to figure out what it was that the witness must have seen. And, of course, in today's technological age it is pos- sible to follow this route towards investigation in a wholly new way. Say your witness has seen a UFO over an adjacent mountain. You don't know what it is. You can go and stand on the mountain and look skyward and hope. But equally you can more easily locate a camcorder point- ing out of the witness' house towards the mountain and film every night for say two weeks, reviewing the foot- age of the sky here at your leisure. Maybe nothing will show up. But maybe it will. By following the way of the witness you have hope of mak- ing progress. There are always going to be possibilities to combine the way of the witness with, as here, the way of the scientist. And sometimes that can be the key to a case. The way of the mystic Finally, there is the way of the mystic. This is certainly the most controversial of my four suggested approaches. Obviously it will come more easily to those who have a spiritual outlook on life, and I often find my self pulled to- wards it by the consequences of the most strange cases with which I get involved. I am not advocating holding a seance to try to com- mune with the aliens, although I know some people would even say this works for them! Rather, when the ways of"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Page 20 May 2001 MUFON UFO Journal the skeptic, scientist and witness have all failed to progress a case (as they sometimes do) then it is worth consider- ing the possibilities beyond. A simple step to take in this regard is to probe into the background of the witness. Have they ever had what we might call psychic experiences? I am no longer surprised how often this proves true. The vast majority of close encounter witnesses in my experience have had a track record of out-of-body experiences, precognitions, polter- geist outbreaks and so on. Because I have found this pattern so often, adopting the way of the mystic has proven to be a valid approach. Learning about the spiritual dimensions of a case does supply new data that you will not get by any other means. And who knows what importance it might have? Similarly, it is in this way that I often find close encoun- ter witnesses describing to me \"the Oz Factor.\" This is just my term for a set of symptoms reported by witnesses during close encounter cases, and that seems to infer that they are in an altered state of consciousness. They report how time stands still, how they lose touch with reality (all ambient sounds vanish, traffic disappears, etc) and how they also seem to enter a peculiar state of reverie. Most often witnesses do not mention this oddity lest you consider them as \"weird\" should they do so. You have to find a way to let them tell you these things with- out leading them on-to make them feel at ease enough to share out-of-the-ordinary things that might have happened. I find the Oz Factor often because I am alert to its existence. I am not surprised that many other investiga- tors hardly ever come across it. But I doubt that this is because it is not there in many cases. By virtue of adopting the way of the mystic I think that I have uncovered as- pects to close encounter cases that would otherwise re- main hidden. So I believe I am closer to the quest for truth as a consequence. British Flying Saucer Bureau closes after half century The British Flying Saucer Bureau, founded in 1953, has ceased operations, according to the Times of London. Denis Plunkett, 70, said there have not been enough re- cent sightings to justify continuing the group. \"I'm just as enthusiastic about flying saucers as I al- ways was,\" he said, \"but the problem is that we are in the middle of a long, long trough. He says the end of the Cold War is partly to blame. \"The number of sightings always rises at times of international tension and declines in times of peace,\" said Plunkett. He also suggested that perhaps the extraterrestrials have finished their study of Earth, which he speculates may have begun after the explosion of the two atomic bombs on Japan in 1945. At one time the British Flying Saucer Bureau claimed 1,500 members worldwide, and reportedly averaged 30 sightings reported weekly. Discovery of dark energy changes view of universe By Ray Villard, Special to SPACE.com & Robin Lloyd, Science Editor A strange repulsive force of \"dark energy\" pervades every nook and cranny of the universe, a team of scien- tists has announced, but the force not only pushes against the master force of gravity-it also has astrophysicists' heads spinning. While gravity gently binds planets, stars, and galaxies together, dark energy tugs on the fabric of time and space, pushing galaxies apart ever faster and faster into the far- thest reaches of the universe. The evidence came in a recent Hubble space telescope observation of the most distant supernova (exploding star) ever detected. The record-breaking supernova appears brighter than it should if the universe had been expanding at a steady rate. The new finding suggests that a deceler- ating universe holds galaxies relatively close together and objects in them would have appeared brighter because they would be closer. The trouble is that with this finding and others in the past three years, the universe is beginning to look like a complex witch's brew of dark energy, normal matter, and dark matter (an invisible exotic form of matter). \"This starts to look incredibly ugly and complicated,\" says Mario Livio of the Space Telescope Science Insti- tute. \"I even wonder if we are we asking right questions.\" The dark energy confirmation comes on the heels of other closed loopholes that have shaken up the astrophys- ics world and lent more support to the accelerating uni- verse idea. For instance, in the past three years, scientists have discovered that the universe is basically flat. This finding and others are knocking down an explanation for variations in the brightness of supernovae-that some type of cosmic dust simply absorbs the light. Saul Perlmutter, who headed up the first group to pub- lish its findings on the accelerating universe three years ago, said the confirmation of dark energy will spark an entirely new brand of physics. \"Dark energy is something we have no clue as to what is causing it, and it doesn't fit into current physics theo- ries, and they have to develop new approaches to explain it,\" said Perlmutter, an astrophysicist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. \"That's exciting. It's rare that we get to do this.\" Newsletters appreciated The Journal staff appreciates receiving newsletters from local MUFON groups.

Hall Ron Westrum notes in the April 2001 issue that we (Ufology) are slack in carrying through systematic inves- tigations and verification of what we believe to be true, often speculating without justifying or supporting our speculations. His summary comments include a pretty good shorthand blueprint for progress: \"We have lots of raw data from which we have very strongly speculated,\" he says. \"We need to check the infer- ences we have made. We need to marshal the genuine facts that we have in a more coher- ent and logical way. We need to connect up the stuff we are doing with mainstream sci- ence.\" Of course, there are some good reasons why we have failed to be thorough and complete (mainly lack of re- search funds and manpower). But there are also \"bad reasons\" at times: A lack of professionalism; a poor un- derstanding of scientific procedures; and a failure to weed out the fraud, opportunism, and pseudoscience which is rampant in the field. This latter hodgepodge is the pri- mary image of \"Ufology\" seen by important persons and institutions in society. There also is a certain pretense in Ufology that we (\"we\" encompassing both our strongest and our weakest links) in our spare time-how much full-time Ufology is there?-are smart enough, and capable enough, and have the necessary resources to figure all this stuff out and establish the truth all by ourselves. In my estimation, this is self-delusion of the worst sort and it is hurting our cause severely. What is \"our cause,\" by the way? I am assuming that we all more or less agree that we want to find out the truth about UFOs, to get the important institutions of society to take the subject seri- ously, and if they are hiding important information from us, for governments to tell us everything they know. If this, or something like it, is really what we are trying to achieve, then we badly need far more human and fi- nancial resources than the thin ranks of \"weekend war- riors\" that presently constitute \"Ufology\" can possibly bring to bear. We also need to adopt a new attitude and shed the pretense that \"we\" can do everything by our- selves and try to make the connection with mainstream science that Westrum recommends. The scientifically oriented members of \"Ufology\" can (and perhaps should) think of ourselves as torch bearers, trying to keep the flame burning until those fully qualified and better informed members of the scientific and mili- tary communities can do the job that needs to be done, with full support from government and society. But we shouldn't think of ourselves as able to do all these things by ourselves. How many years have \"we\" been trying to do that, and where has it gotten us? In The UFO Evidence, Volume II I lay out the \"Ele- ments of a Scientific Study\" in the last section that could resolve the UFO controversy for once and for all. It is based on a lot of data presented in the previous sections and provides a blueprint for progress in obtaining some meaningful answers. Never forget that there are those among us, also con- sidered to be \"Ufologists\" since that is such a poorly de- fined and arbitrary term, who have a vested interest in maintaining mystery and intrigue rather than resolving the issues because they find it personally profitable and/or ego-satisfying to be the resident priests. We need to decide clearly what our ultimate goal is, how it can best be accompli shed, and what we need to do as individuals and organizations to expedite the process. My views are strongly on record that we need to do a lot of housecleaning, expose fraud, practice science, and as- semble a credible and coherent case to persuade science and society to take a hard look at the solid facts, not at the unfortunate tabloid image that is the curse of Ufology.

It shines at a maximum magnitude of-2.4, with an apparent diameter of 21\" of arc. Mars rises in the SE around sunset and then remains in view in the southern sky all night long. Though the planet lies rather low in the sky for north- ern observers, telescope-users still should take this op- portunity to glimpse such dark equatorial features as Syrtis Major, which will face our Western Hemisphere during the first half of June and the first half of July. The S polar ' cap should stand out prominently. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus reaches its maximum point (elongation) W of the Sun on the 8th. At magnitude -4.4 then, its bright disc resembles a half moon through a small telescope. The imposing planet rises about 3 AM in mid-June and stands low in the E at dawn. It pairs up nicely with the crescent Moon on the 17th and 18th. Mars advances across the southern sky to a point low in the SE at dawn. Saturn (-0.3), in Taurus, emerges in the ENE about 4 AM late in June. The ringed world lies near the lunar crescent on June 19. Moon Phases: Full moonâJune 5 Last quarterâJune 13 New moonâJune 21 First quarterâJune 27 The Stars: On June 21 the Sun arrives at an invisible point in the sky known as the summer solstice (midway between the equinoxes). At that moment summer begins in the North- ern Hemisphere. The arrival of summer means the ascendance in the E of that seasonal sky symbol, the Summer Triangle (the stars Vega, Deneb, Altair), and the waning in the W of the spring symbol, Leo the Lion. Look for the little crown of Princess Ariadne, Corona Borealis, on the celestial meridian in the S. It is a semi- circle of 7 stars. And on the meridian near the southern horizon can be found the trio of stars marking the head of Scorpius the Scorpion. From his head, follow the string of stars that extends eastward (to the left) through Antares (the creature's red heart) and then around his curling tail to the stinger at the end. To see the tail, choose a clear un- obstructed horizon. The later in the evening the better. And the farther S you are, the higher the constellation. Calendar May 5-6, Fortnite '01, College Park, MD.

The main tool for Field Investigators is the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual. The manual is organized for easy self-study and provides the guidelines for con- ducting MUFON field investigations. The manual may be ordered for $25 plus $3.50 P&H from MUFON, P.O. Box 369, Morrison, CO 80465-0369. The final step in the process is for the trainee to re- quest a Field Investigator's Exam from MUFON Head- quarters. The exam is an open-book self-administered test and may be ordered whenever the Field Investigator Trainee has completed the prescribed field of study and is ready to be tested. Alan Vaughan dies Alan Vaughan passed away on April 8. His Memorial Gathering was April 20 at the Chapel of the Hollywood Forever Cemetery, Hollywood, CA. The announcement was made by his companion, Carolyn Koch. Author Desmond Leslie dies Desmond Leslie, co-author with George Stransky of Flying Saucers Have Landed, has died at the age of 79 in the south of France. Leslie wrote both non-fiction and fiction, including Space Race (with astronomer Patrick Moore), The Jesus File, Suzy Saucer, Ronnie Rocket, and The Incredible Mr. Lutterworth. None, of course, is as well known to ufologists as Flying Saucers Have Landed, which has been translated into numerous languages. Leslie was working on Pandora, a novel about the women in his life, when he died. Article used without permission The article \"A comparison of the pre-war cryptoanalysis of Japanese ciphers to the Majestic-12,\" by Paul B. Th- ompson, which appeared in the January, 2001, issue of the Journal, was used without the permission of the au- thor. Murray Bott, MUFON National Director for New Zealand, who submitted the article, has asked us to \"con- vey to those people concerned my regret at having been party to the problem.\" We also apologize for the over- sight. In communications with Mr. Thompson we are happy to report that the situation has now been resolved to everyone's satisfaction. Nova Scotia city marks UFO visit with postage stamp Les Perreaux National Post-Residents of Shag Harbour, N.S., will be mailing an image of a flying saucer with every letter and package after Canada Post approved a new postmark commemorating a visit 34 years ago by an unidentified flying object. The crash has become the subject of popular lore, in- cluding a book, and has also made the town a tourist draw. The locally designed ink stamp, used to mark and date outgoing mail, depicts a flying saucer hovering over wa- ter with a lighthouse and boat beneath it. The scene refers to an incident in 1967 in which an apparent UFO plunged into the bay near the town and sent the RCMP, Coast Guard, and townspeople on a fruit- less search-and-rescue mission. At about 11:30 p.m. on Oct. 4,1967, Laurie Wickens and three friends were driving home when they saw an orange light heading toward the water, and called police. \"At first the cops didn't want to believe us, but then we found out another cop had seen it too,\" Mr. Wickens re- calls. He and several witnesses, including RCMP offic- ers, watched the light floating on the water until it sank. An all-night search found nothing except a 600-metre strip of floating, yellow scum. No official explanation has been offered for the lights, but theories at the time had a Cold War influence and involved a Russian spacecraft or submarine. Some believe it was a U.S. military plane. \"There are so many people coming in who are inter- ested in having their picture taken here or having their mail stamped, I thought we needed something with a UFO design,\" said postmaster Cindy Nickerson, who came up with the idea for the stamp two years ago. The design is also being used on T-shirts, hats and commemorative wooden nickels Canada Post has created many postmarks for com- munities, including a teddy bear hugging a heart for Love, Sask., and Anne of Green Gables for Cavendish, P.E.I. \"It's a concept that goes over very well with collectors,\" said Tim McGurrin. spokesman for Canada Post. The ink stamp will be officially unveiled in May. MUFON Merchandise Wear official MUFON T-shirts (royal blue print- ing on white cotton), sizes S, M, L & XL.
