Certainly that was the case in early May of 2001 when I had appeared as a panelist on the Cincinnati-based cable-television program \"UFO Up- date: LIVE!\" produced by Bob Leibold, executive direc- tor of Natural Light Productions. The program does not play only in Cincinnati, as it is routinely \"bicycled\" around to various public access cable facilities in Ohio. It has been seen in Columbus and is quite popular with viewers in Dayton (notorious for the legendary \"Blue Room\" or \"Hangar 18\" of Wright Patterson Air Force Base). One particular episode was cablecast on Northern Kentucky's CPC (Community Program Center) Chan- nel 21, and with my telephone number appearing on- screen. In the midst of several mindless callers, most likely tricksters caught up in the frivolity and tomfoolery of UFOs, one strange call came to my attention. It was the nearly illegible voice of a man leaving a number for me to return his call. The voice was raspy and wheezy sounding-to be truth- ful, like one of the prank phone callers that sometimes respond to the TV program. Little did I know it was the voice of someone fighting for his life. Mr. Benjamin Davidson, a resident of Covington, KY, had twice con- tacted my voice mail telephone number. Upon receipt of his first message, I did not return the call immediately (being leery of the voice on the other end of the line). When he called a second time, I notified associate researcher Chris Coffey (personal secretary to the late Leonard Stringfield) that someone with an un- usual voice was trying to contact me regarding \"some- thing to do with UFOs.\" After listening to the recording and giving some seri- ous consideration that the unusual voice might not be a prank, a decision was made to call the telephone number, and together we spoke with Mr. Davidson by 3-way tele- phone conversation. Davidson, who was born in 1938, explained that his body was ravaged with cancer, and that he was dying. His voice was destroyed by the disease and he could barely be understood. Davidson explained that he had \"just a few days\" left to live and had an important story that he wanted to tell. Both Chris Coffey and I listened closely to discern what he was saying through his slight, wheezy gasp. This story, he explained with the agony of a dying man, had never been told to anyone before he About the Author Kenny Young is MUFON State Section Director for Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky. approached us with this strange account in May of 2001. He had never told his wife nor anyone in his family... no- body. As we listened with cautious interest, Davidson said that he had been involved in an unusual incident that hap- pened in April or June of 1964 or 1965, the exact date of which was lost in the fog of time. Interestingly, the occur- rence had strangely escaped his thoughts until the early 1990s. Mr. Davidson explained that while sitting at his kitchen table sometime in the early 90s, a cigarette burned the hair on his arms. This burning smell of singed hair on his arms triggered a flood of memo- ries from April or June of '64 or '65 that he found very disturb- ing. He explained that in '64 or '65, he was employed as an ex- terminator and would travel from Portsmouth, OH, to Cin- cinnati along U.S. Route 52. Fre- quently he would retrieve and haul chemicals along this route. It was on a late Sunday night midway along one of these hauls (between April and June) that he was driving along the dark roadway after taking a tempo- rary diversion to visit his mother. Moving into a small clear- ing along U.S. Route 52 somewhere in the vicinity of Ab- erdeen or Manchester, OH, a semi-circular object ap- peared situated on the roadway in front of him, obstruct- ing his route. The object, he said, was oval-shaped and was com- prised of some sort of iron or aluminum with different colored lights around it. Due to this roadblock, Mr. Davidson drew his car to a halt. He said he was con- fronted by several entities that were standing along the roadside of U.S. Route 50 near Aberdeen and taken onto the object. Davidson described them as \"creatures\" or \"what you would call aliens.\" \"What kind of creatures-what did they look like?\" I asked. Davidson went on to describe the creatures, say- ing that these entities were not similar to the ones usually reported in UFO literature. They did not look like the child-sized, large-headed, black-eyed staring aliens that appear on television and in the movies. But rather, these beings resembled the insect known as a \"Preying Mantis.\" Upon his utterance of this revelation, Chris Coffey gasped and later said: \"I knew he was going to say that.\" A dark experience Davidson said that at no time did the creatures speak to him as he was escorted into the large object that blocked his path on the roadway. The escort, he said, was \"non- Kenny Young February 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"violent. I don't know why,\" Davidson recalled, \"but I wasn't afraid.\" The interior of this object, he said, was well lit, but he could not discern a light source. He estimated there were about 20 of the \"Preying Mantis\" occupants on board the object as he was taken to a table and subjected to some sort of physical examination. \"They scraped the skin off my hands, they clipped my fingernails and took blood,\" he said during the 20-minute telephone discussion. He again reassured us that he had told this story to nobody before now. Davidson suddenly paused for a moment. Both Chris and I waited, thinking that he must be struggling to recall the details or dealing with physical agony. \"There's some- thing else that was went on there,\" he said after the pause. \"There was another examining table in the room. On this examining table was a little girl. That little girl was dead.\" Chris and I listened with a dreadful silence. \"I know she was dead,\" he said. \"I didn't know who she was or where she came from, but it was quite obvious that she was dead.\" \"What did you do?\" I asked. He replied, \"What could I do? I didn't do anything.\" Davidson said he had little memory of anything else taking place during this episode, only recalling that he woke up at a traffic light some- where near Portsmouth, OH. Being several hours late from home, his wife was deeply concerned. Upon arriving home, he was unable to explain his prolonged absence. In the years since the event, his wife has been of the suspicion that he was having an extramarital affair, and this had caused anxiety in their relationship. You had better hurry In closing, he again asserted that it was his dying intent to share this information. When asked if he would agree to allow us to videotape his story, he tentatively agreed but said: \"You better hurry.\" So ended our conversation. I planned to notify TV producer Bob Leibold and have him make arrangements to meet me in the next week to interview Davidson. All I needed to do was to set up a confirmed time we could meet Mr. Davidson at his home. A call made to his residence several days later was answered by his wife. Benjamin Davidson, she said, had died. Our plans to meet Mr. Davidson and videotape his comments would not take place due to his death after my one and only conversation with him. I felt in shock. His wife was silent. She said only that she knew that he had talked with us before his death, and she became aware of his bizarre story when he told her of the discus- sion he had with us. She did not offer any comment on his account and no comment was requested. For me, the nature of the delivery of this report was quite startling and somewhat disturbing. This was clearly something important to Mr. Davidson, I thought, as he struggled to tell his story. I was of the impression that he was sincere and that he felt this to be one of his last acts. It clearly was. More profound than the last acts of a dying man may be the incredible story he had to relate. Childhood sighting continues to mystify witness Reported by Andy Romano DATE: 1949 or 1950 (I was 8 or 9 years old) PLACE: The sighting occurred over my home in densely populated Newark, NJ. DURATION of sighting: five to ten minutes. SKY CONDITIONS: absolutely clear, cloudless, moon- less night. BACKGROUND: For as long as I can remember, I was a \"sky watcher.\" I was very interested in astronomy as a young boy, and had built my own telescope. This particular spring night, at about 9 PM, I was in my back- yard. Casually looking up, I saw what appeared to be a single yellowish-white globe of light approaching from due west (I know it was west because it came from the direction of a cemetery which was just a block west of our house). At first I didn't think much of it. It could have been a high-flying SAC B47 or 52 or any of the other large mili- tary planes which roamed our skies in those years, catch- ing the last rays of the already-set sun. We were in the flight path to metro airports, so I was very used to seeing the approach lights of descending flights. This wasn't like any of those things. It had the appar- ent luminosity of a bright star-about that of a first magni- tude star, but it was NOT a \"point\" of light. It was a distinct flattish globe or disc. Having an anylitical mind, I thought: a large scientific balloon? Perhaps. It wasn't a plane, because the shape was, well... round. And it wasn't a balloon because as it passed directly over- head, at my zenith... it stopped instantly! Oh, it didn't de- celerate. It went from its smooth straight-as-an-arrow cruising speed, which I can only estimate at about 300 mph, to a dead stop. Any human on board would have been crushed by his own mass/inertia! Hmm. The little boy thought, still searching for an explana- tion. What stops in mid-air? Helicopter? Maybe. But it was too high for copters of the day. It's amazing how you can estimate speed and altitude by \"feel.\" We're talking 30 to 50,000 feet here. No chopper of the day could do that. Besides, there was NO sound whatsoever. Even at that altitude you would hear something in the cool night air. As I pondered this, my eyes almost popped out when I saw another, identical globe approach the first one from due east! When it reached my overhead, it too stopped dead! The two globes hung there, absolutely motionless, no wobbling, no drifting, no change in brightness, just a little less than the diameter of the moon from one another. Two silent helicopters with bright but soft lights meeting 50,000 feet over Newark in 1949? Not likely. At that point I was overcome with a strange feeling of awe. I knew I was seeing something so utterly strange that it just couldn't possibly be. But there it was. Then I really got goosebumps. The two objects began to revolve (Continued on page 11) Page 4 MUFON UFO Journal February 2003"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Part II Mexican pilot relates possible MIB contacts following encounter Investigated by Carlos Alberto Guzman Rojas and Francisco Dominguez de la Rosa Editor's Note: In the January issue, pilot Carlos Antonio de los Santos Montiel described having his Piper PA-24 aircraft taken over by three UFOs as he flew toward Mexico City, and having to make an emergency landing. This month he discusses the strange occurrences following this experience: Some time passed, and about 15 days later Mr. Pedro Ferris of TV Channel 8 called my house, interested to talk about my experience. He said: \"I would like to know if it is possible to have an interview with you.\" I told my father, and he advised me to do so, but only stating what I saw and experienced. I agreed to meet Mr. Pedro Ferris close to Barranca del Muerto Avenue, on a Friday, where TV channel 8 used to be located, in a southwestern part of Mexico City. Men In Black? On the day of the interview, I had to be early in the offices of Mexicana de Aviacion, since I was taking train- ing classes to become a member of this company. After leaving the training course, I was driving down on a south- western Mexico City expressway called \"Anillo Periferico\" (Peripheral Ring), and before coming to the exit to Barranca del Muerto Avenue, a black auto ap- proached mine. I was driving in the middle lane, and it got even with me. Then, another black auto approached mine, passed me, and suddenly stopped in front of mine. I was about to get out of the auto, but at that moment two subjects, dressed in black, with rather dark brown hair, more or less yellow skin, and hairless, got out of each one of these black autos. I believed they were members escorting somebody im- portant and to which I accidentally cut in or annoyed in some way. When I was about to come out of the car, one of these men in black hurried up to me, grabbed the door, stuck his head inside the auto, and said in a very mechani- cal way, \"If you appreciate your life and that of your fam- ily do not say anything else.\" That was the only thing they said. They went back to their autos and drove away. These men were about two meters tall, had well-developed bodies, had features of people from the northern hemisphere, spoke very me- chanically, very precise, a very exact Spanish language, very direct, cold, and well defined. Some other Interviewers later asked me, \"Were there About the co-author Carlos A. Guzman Rojas, co-author of this report and MUFON representative for Mexico, spoke at the 1996 MUFON International Symposium in Greensboro, NC, on \"A Chronology of Ufology in Mexico.\" This report is from UFOs and Mexican Aviation, which he co-authored with Alfonso Falazar Mendoza. UFOs and Mexican Avia- tion is available in Spanish from Arturus Books. other autos coming?\" The other autos circulated on the extreme right lane. I believed the drivers of the other autos must have thought there was an auto accident and that my intention had been to avoid the auto in front of me, but I only braked to stop. I would have had to drive in reverse in order to avoid these, still thinking they were escorting somebody, but I stayed there to find out what was the matter. After this event, I did not meet with Mr. Pedro Ferris. I returned to the offices of Mexicana de Aviacion where my father worked, who asked me what happened in my interview with Mr. Pedro Ferris. I told him exactly what happened, and he advised me to leave .things as they stand, fearful that something bad might happen to me or to him and the family. I stayed in the office of Mexicana for a while, then I went home. Mr. Pedro Ferris called, complaining about me not showing up to the interview on time, leaving him with all the material and people wanting to meet me, and asked me what happened. I told him precisely what hap- pened and expressed fears that those men might do some- thing bad to me or to any member of my family. He an- swered me that he would ask \"Miguelito\" Aleman to have a police patrol auto to look after us. He requested to meet at another place, assuring me that those people do not do anything, that they were the so called men in black, who only had in mind to persuade, scare those people who had an experience such as mine, but they do not do any physical harm. I agreed to meet him in \"Televicentro\" (a TV com- pany), located in a central Mexico City Avenue named Chapultepec. He gave me instructions on how to get into this place, and so I did. Mr. Pedro Ferris and Jacobo Zabludowsky made their first recording of my experience, each separately, and the same case was with Patricia Suarez. There was another person with Patricia Suarez. This other person exclaimed: \"Next we are introducing you to aircraft captain Carlos Antonio de los Santos Montiel, who claims to have had an experience with some flying sau- cers. It was obvious since he was starving, and could not avoid the fact.\" In that moment I became upset, because this was not the case. Later, a co-worker of Patricia approached me, I do not remember his name. He was a man with very white hair, who began asking me questions. He said: \"Lis- ten captain, let us see, you stated that you spent the night in Zihuatanejo, Guerrero.\" Answering: \"Yes sir.\" He said: \"And you said you ate dinner. What did you February 2003 MUFON UFO Journal PageS"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"eat?\" \"Answering: \"This, that, and this other.\" He said: \"And the next morning you said you ate break- fast. What did you have for breakfast?\" Answering: \"Two country style eggs, bread with jelly spread, coffee and orange juice.\" He said: \"Listen, between both of us, did you put any- thing unusual to the eggs, in your breakfast?\" (Asking this when the conversation was \"live.\") I told him: \"What do you mean? Something like a drug or anything similar? Listen, I am in my twenties and so far I have not attempted to try any drug, bad habit, ciga- rettes, liquor, or anything of the sort. This is because I hold my own scruples, not because of my parents or school- ing.\" Well, more or less after a month had elapsed, Mr. Pedro Ferris called me again on the phone, telling me that a NASA technical adviser who had been a USA Air Force adviser, was coming. He was Dr. J. Allen Hynek. He was also bringing a letter from President Gerald Ford, and he wanted to inter- view me, because they had known about my experience. Once again I sought the trust and advice of my father. He advised me, saying: \"Go ahead,\" but also, said not to say anything more or less about this matter: \"Tell exactly what you saw and nothing else; do not try to impress any- body or seek a publicity. That will not help you at all.\" I accepted and asked to go with him to pick up the Doctor at the airport. Mr. Pedro Ferris, his son Pedro, my brother Jorge, and myself went to the airport. Dr.Hynek arrived on a Friday. Interview with Dr. Hynek In his hotel suite, in a living room, he took out some tape recorders and began to ask me questions. However, the type of questions he asked were not anymore those stupid or morbid questions as those asked by Patricia Suarez and her coworkers. He asked: \"Listen, are you an aircraft pilot?\" Answering: \"Yes.\" He asked: \"Commercial aircraft pilot?\" Answering: \"Yes.\" He asked: \"Did you have a speedometer in your air- craft?\" Answering: \"Yes.\" He asked: \"How does the speedometer function, and for what purpose does it function?\" Answering: \"A speedometer is a differential manom- eter, functioning because of a difference of pressure, and the difference in pressure is what is indicated in the read- ing. Enters an impact pressure, and well, these are tech- nical terms.\" He said: \"OK, now how does your altimeter function? ounis yln. Aviation Mexieana 50 a ft os lie encuentros » con OUNIS en cl cspacio nereo mevicano lmlu;.L m.-is ile J\" luiMnrali v flucililtcmo- nlifjiilcv tlr | Cirlos Alberto Gilyiiiiu Rajiv You do have an altimeter, don't you? How does function and in relation to what does the altimeter function?\" Answering: \"The same; it is also a differential manom- eter functioning by impact pressure. The pressure takes off on two directions, one of the pressures heads towards a manometer and the other one goes to an aneroid cap- sule.\" Speaking in the same terminology, I analyzed in a piece- meal form everything inside the cockpit... How does this function ... ? How does this other thing work ... ? How does this function ... ? These were typical commercial pilot's examination questions. What is an air route? What is Tequesquitengo? What is a VOR? What is Mexico Center? Which is the emergency radio frequency ... ? Which is the emergency landing sys- tem? In general, he asked these typi- cal questions. These questions added up to about four hours of tape record- ings. Once he was through with these questions, he said: \"You must be ask- ing yourself why I am asking these type of questions. Don't you? Well the truth is because it is a commercial aircraft pilot's examination. Anybody could be the owner of an aircraft, fly it, and not be an aircraft pilot. He does not know what he is doing. He takes off, and lands, is the plane owner, and has a private aircraft license to fly. How- ever, you are a commercial aircraft pi- lot, this is your case, and now tell me about your experience. What happened? How did this experience take place?\" Then, I told him that I went to \"La Villita,\" to Lazaro Cardenas, Michoacan, then to Zihuatanejo, Guerrero, and from here, on Sunday 3 of May Of 1975... the experience took place. Once the interview was concluded, Dr. Hynek invited me to have breakfast with him the next Sunday (at that time, Mr. Pedro Ferris, his son, and Jorge were present.) He asked me to come alone, because he wanted to speak about a very confidential matter, private matters only to me. Accepting, he told me to be there at 9:00 hours. More MIB's? That Sunday I woke up early to be on time for my appointment with Dr. J. Allen Hynek. I arrived early. It was inside the Hotel Diplomatico in a suite, on Avenida Insurgentes Sur, in the south central side of Mexico City. I parked my car in the street, next to the sidewalk. I got out of the car, locked it, and was putting away my car keys, looking down and climbing the stairs to the entrance of the hotel when half way up the stairs I felt a hand slapping over my chest. I raised my head and saw one of the same big men in black, which had stopped me the other day who said, \"You were warned once. This is the second time.\" On that occasion, I got a hold of some bravery and told him, \"Lis- Page 6 MUFON UFO Journal February 2003"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"ten, I do not believe I am doing harm to anybody. If 1 can make, something useful of my experience because I ex- perienced an emergency and came all right from it, and experienced something that at the present has no expla- nation, no logic, an extraordinary experience, and I do not have any inconvenience making something out of all this, if it has any usefulness.\" Then, he said, \"Turn around and leave. You are not going inside to meet the Doctor.\" I then said, \"Well, I came here because he invited me for breakfast.\" Re- peating himself he said, \"Turn around and leave!\" Some other interviewer later asked, \"He spoke to you in the same tone as the one you mentioned previously?\" I replied, \"Yes, the very same, and I cannot tell you which one he was, because both looked alike. The first time, when they told me: 'If you value your life somehow and that of your family, do not say anything else,' I am saying this with my own voice. However, it was said more mechanical, more solemn, mostly threatening and intimi- dating. When we speak fluently we separate the words, but they do not. That's what I mean for mechanical. Not that it was a robot.\" I did not go in to have breakfast. Then, I immediately went to \"Televicentro\" (a TV company) to locate Mr. Pedro Ferris. He asked: \"What happened? Didn't you have breakfast with Dr. J. Allen Hynek?\" Answering: \"No,\" and told him what happened and expressed myself as having felt more danger this time around. He sided with my motives and asked me to quit seeing each other for some time because he considered the situation more delicate this time around. I told him: \"What I am requesting of you is you call by phone Dr. Hynek or send him a letter giving him my apolo- gies. I do not want him to think that I did not show up because I was nasty.\" He said, \"Don't you worry. I will take care of it.\" The investigators comment: We believe that the experience of Carlos Antonio de los Santos Montiel occurred. There are too many obser- vations made and filed by others, such as radar operators and aircraft pilots to dismiss such a case as false. In addi- tion, a Lear jet aircraft saw visually the three objects that took over the controls of the small aircraft with captain de los Santos aboard. Carlos Antonio de los Santos is a reliable witness. He now has a lovely family and is still working in the aviation field, which is his professional passion, and later on hopes to be able to advance more details of his expe- rience in a book where he will share many other experi- ences not told in this brief interview. We deeply thank captain Carlos Antonio for giving up the time to describe directly and personally his extraordi- nary experience.

UFOs, cults, and cloning By Dr. Barry H. Downing UFOs are back in the news, but not in a way that is going to be pleasing to most MUFON members. The Dec. 28,2002, issue of The New York Times head- lined a story about cloning, written by Dana Candey and Kenneth Chang. The story began, \"A sect that believes space travelers created the human race by cloning said today that it had produced the first human clone, a healthy seven-pound baby girl it says was bom on Thursday. \"The scientist, Dr. Brigette Boisselier, said that the baby, nicknamed Eve, was fine and that tests would show she is a clone of her mother, a 31-year-old American.\" The space age religious cult behind this news is the Raelian Movement, headed by former French race car journalist Claude Verilhon, who claims that during various UFO contacts, aliens gave him the name Rael. The Times further reported that \"Michael Guillen, a former science editor for ABC News, said at the news conference that the Raelians had invited him to arrange for independent tests. He said he was neither a member of the group nor paid by them.\" Rick Ross, writing at the internet site http:// www.cultnews.com, has complained that Guillen is not really as \"independent\" as he claims, and suggests that Dr. Boisselier took \"$300,000 from a couple\" with the promise to clone their dead son. The Raelian Movement summarizes its beliefs at http/ /www.rael.org/int/english/index.html, but may also be found in Rael's book The Message Given by Extraterrestials. Rael claims that on Dec. 13,1973, a UFO landed in his presence in the crater of a volcano in Auvergne, France, an alien met him, and in effect called him to be a prophet for the \"Elohim,\" a space race mistakenly referred to in the Bible as God. Aliens take the place of God The Raelian Movement is in many ways an atheistic form of the biblical religion, wherein the aliens take the place of God. The aliens would be our \"equals\" if we would only embrace peace, truth, and spirituality, and give up our love for money. Rael's story is that the aliens (Elohim) created life on earth as an experiment, but humans got a little out of hand, and so \"religion\" was created-all the world religions-to help guide humanity to this point. Prophets like Moses, February 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Mohammed, Jesus, and Buddha were under the direction of the aliens. But humanity has advanced to the point now where we would have something like the second coming of Jesus, the return of the Elohim, and we need to build an \"Embassy\" (not a Temple) in which to welcome them. The Elohim do not want to deal directly with world governments because they are so sinful. Rael was \"cho- sen\" to be the prophet for \"preparing the way\" not of the Lord, but of the Elohim. He was conceived on Dec. 25, 1945 as a sign of his alien mission! (Not many publish their conception date.) Cloning the way to eternal life? In Rael's theology, cloning is the way to eternal life. By the process of cloning, we can keep reproducing our- selves (as do the aliens), and thereby gain eternal life. We will soon know how to program our memories into the newly cloned bodies. What is my opinion of Rael and his \"revelation\"? I do not buy his story, although there are some who would say that I am partly to blame for this kind of UFO religion. In fact, some members of the Raelian Movement have called me and asked me to join the movement. (I declined.) I want to point out that although I cannot prove that Rael did not have some kind of UFO revelation, most of his ideas were in print, at least in seminal form, before 1973. Most of Rael's \"revelations\" were already in cur- rency in speculative form in books such as The Sky People by Brinsley LePoer Trench, who in 1960 suggested that the Garden of Eden may have been some kind of extra- terrestrial laboratory. My own The Bible and Flying Saucers (1968) sug- gested links between UFOs, Moses, and Jesus, not to mention the speculations of Erich von Daniken's Chari- ots of the Gods? (1969). Why don't I believe Raells story? The basic issue for me is this: the aliens are too much like us, too open in the Rael revelation. I believe UFOs are real, I believe there is tremendous religious significance to UFOs, and I be- lieve that the UFO aliens, whoever they are, do in fact contact people in such a way that something like religious revelation occurs. But this revelation is \"behind a screen, behind a veil,\" we cannot quite see for sure what is on the other side. Rael's Elohim seem like a bunch of Rotarians who know a little bit of science. Researchers like Dr. John Mack have noted a strong spiritual dimension to many UFO contacts. MUFON member Raymond Fowler has of course explored the re- ligious dimension in Betty Andreasson Luca's experi- ences; there is a strong religious element in the reported experiences of Whitley Strieber. There are researchers, like Budd Hopkins, who be- lieve we should avoid seeing religion in UFO contacts, although in his book Witnessed: The True Story of the Brooklyn Bridge UFO Abductions Hopkins says, \"A true cult, such as that of Reverend Moon, or the Branch Davidians, is all beliefs and no miracles. The UFO phe- nomenon is all miracles and no beliefs.\" (P. 313) About the author Dr. Downing, the author of The Bible and Flying Sau- cers, formerly served as pastor of Northminster Presby- terian Church in Endwell, NY, retiring after 34 years. He is a member of the national board of directors for the Fund for UFO Research (FUFOR). He holds the B.A. in Physics from Hartwick Bollege, the B.D. from Princeton Theological Seminary, and the Ph.D. from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, specializing in the re- lationship between natural science and Christian theol- ogy. Most of what I consider to be likely \"true\" UFO con- tact cases have an element of \"disguise\" that is missing in the Rael revelation. It is this lack of mystery that makes Rael appealing, of course. He has all the answers. The rest of us are in the dark. In my article \"The Rock of Ages Principle\" (MUFON UFO Journal, May 1990, p. 10), I said, \"The issue of disguise is one of the most fundamental aspects of the UFO mystery, and should become one of the next major areas of UFO research/' In the Bible, God makes Moses hide in a rock as God passes by. The implication is that direct contact between humanity and God would be deadly. There seems to be no danger in the Rael contacts. One of the reasons the governments of the world can continue to lie about the UFO presence is that UFOs seek to reveal themselves and stay hidden at the same time. There is none of this hiddenness in the Raelian story. The bottom line for me is, Rael knows more than he should know on the basis of both biblical revelation, and other modern contact stories. If, however, the Raelians have indeed cloned a human, it will be interesting to see what the consequences are for ufology. The Times article said, \"Bioethicists, religious and political figures and world leaders, including President Bush and the United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan were almost universal yesterday in condemning the announcement.\" A bite of forbidden fruit? With that kind of blanket condemnation, the Raelians must have felt they had bitten into the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden. In fact, what the Raelians claim to be selling is eternal life, cloning style-they will grab onto the \"tree of life, and live forever\"(Genesis 3:22). If the Raelians can convince people that science, through clon- ing, can give us eternal life, we will have a battle between science, religion, politics, and ethics that should be quite entertaining. And I would think that more and more, the population at large will demand to know the truth about UFOs. I believe that the History Channel is planning a four-part series on UFOs to run early in 2003. Parts of this series (I was told) will include issues involving UFOs and religion. My advice to MUFON: keep doing the best UFO sci- ence you can. Until our government decides to tell the truth about UFOs, MUFON is one of the best public sources of serious UFO information.

Although her father, Elmer \"Lucky\" Sutton, said he was one of the people who witnessed the alien invasion on Aug. 21, 1955, he didn't talk about it to Hawkins until the late 1960s when two writers contacted him for an interview. \"This was the first I'd ever heard of it,\" Hawkins said about the Kelly, KY, incident during an interview at her home in Princeton. \"I remember it was a man and woman that came to the house. I had never heard anything about it. I remember sitting in the floor with my legs crossed, listening to this story. It terrified me.\" The sighting occurred at Kelly, a small town on U.S. 41 about eight miles north of Hopkinsville. \"Lucky\" Sutton, who was living in a small farmhouse on the Old Madisonville Road at Kelly, and several family members said a spaceship landed near the house that evening. It was carrying about a dozen little space creatures, they said. \"Lucky\" Sutton and other family members said they had a gun battle with the creatures that lasted for hours. Most of the Sutton family members who said they fought the aliens off with shotguns are deceased. How- ever, Hawkins and her younger brother, Elmer Sutton Jr., of Trigg County, said their father shared his Kelly experi- ence with them. Hawkins, 41, and Sutton, 35, are the chil- dren of \"Lucky\" Sutton and Glorine Powell, of Trigg County. Their father died on Dec. 5, 1995. \"He talked to me about it because I was one of the last ones to leave home,\" the younger Sutton said. \"I prodded him about it a lot. A lot of times he wouldn't talk about it. If I'd catch him in the right mood, he'd sit down and talk for hours about it. When he did, I'd listen. To be honest with you, he knew some day he'd die, and I guess he wanted one of us to know the truth.\" According to the family, a visitor to the Sutton house, Billy Ray Taylor of Pennsylvania, had been in the back yard getting water from the well. He noticed a light streak across the sky and descend into the trees along a ravine about a quarter of a mile away. A while later, \"Lucky\" Sutton's mother, Glennie Lankford, saw a creature with long arms and talon-like hands raised in the air approaching the back of the house. \"(Dad) said they appeared to have a human shape, but with some modifications that made them different,\" Sutton said. \"He called them little green men. He called them green, but said they actually weren't green. He said they were silver, but they had a greenish silver glow to them. Geraldine Hawkins and Elmer Sutton Jr. relax at Hawkins' Princeton home. He said they were about three feet tail-about the size of a five-year-old. Their arms were double the length of hu- mans' and had pointed ears. He said the eyes were in the same place as humans, but were more of an almond shape. The eyes had a luminous glow. He said they didn't walk, just skimmed on top of the ground, but moved their legs.\" \"Lucky\" Sutton and Taylor each armed themselves and fired several shots at the aliens, they later reported to police. The siege continued through the night, they said. None of the bullets seemed to affect the creatures. \"He told me he didn't know what in the world they had in mind, but he wasn't going to stand around to find out,\" Sutton said. \"He's just one of the kind of guys to see something like that and naturally think 'they're going to do something. I've got to protect my family.' I guess that's what he done. He beared arms and started laying into them. I'd have done the same thing. I'd have been aiming right between the eyes,\" he said. \"If they had've hurt one they could have retaliated,\" Hawkins said. \"What else was he supposed to do? Go up and shake one of their hands?\" Sutton asked. The Suttons, Taylor, Lankford, and a few children in the house that night said they piled into two cars and headed for the police station in Hopkinsville. City, county, and state police, along with military personnel from then Camp Campbell flocked to the Kelly homestead and stayed until about 2 a.m. They searched the house, the yard, surrounding fields, and a wooded area, but reportedly found nothing. The family claimed the creatures returned again about 3 a.m. and stayed until morning. In the past 47 years, numerous media reports have circulated worldwide speculating about what happened in February 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"the community of Kelly. Most recently, the local legend has attracted the attention of an independent production company in Glendale, CA. A film crew from Barcon Productions came to Hopkinsville recently to research the Kelly incident. Barcon has been filming eyewitness accounts for a film entitled \"Monsters of the UFO\" to be released next summer. Contrary to some media reports, Hawkins insists that her father and other family members were not drinking that night, nor did they fabricate the story. Although in- vestigators at the scene failed to find the spot where the spaceship landed, she said her parents took her to the spot about 20 years later. \"The following weekend after those two (writers) had been there to talk to him, they took us out there to where it happened. I remember a big, round, burned out place back there in the field. It was still there,\" Hawkins said. Hawkins and Sutton said many of the reports referred to the Suttons as \"a low-status group of people,\" and used their father and Taylor's employment with a carnival to discredit the family's story. \"They sensationalized the story because (Billy Ray and my father) worked at the carnival. That they were able to create this fiasco,\" Hawkins said. \"He wouldn't have done that anyway. He wasn't that type of person. You could look at him and tell that something happened to them that night. They couldn't have made up something like that. They were just country folks. They wouldn't have thought to think up something like that so elaborate. They wouldn't have run to town terrified in the middle of the night.\" Despite any speculations from outside sources, the sib- lings believe what their father told them about the Kelly incident. \"I could always tell when my dad was pulling my leg or not. He wasn't pulling a fast one,\" Sutton said. \"It was a serious thing to him. It happened to him. He said it happened to him. He said it wasn't funny. It was an experience he said he would never forget. It was fresh in his mind until the day he died. It was fresh in his mind like it happened yesterday. He never cracked a smile when he told the story because it happened to him and there wasn't nothing funny about it. He got pale and you could see it in his eyes. He was scared to death,\" he said. Hawkins and Sutton agree that people should have more of an open mind to the unexplained phenomena. \"I think God didn't mean for us to understand every- thing. He doesn't want us to know everything,\" Hawkins said. \"Man might want to know everything. I think there's some things out there that He doesn't want us to figure out and know what they are.\" \"We're here. We're breathing and living. Why can't there be something else out there,\" Sutton said, pointing to the sky. \"Back then I think it was harder,\" Hawkins added. \"Now, in this day and age, people are more apt to believe stuff like that. A lot of people don't believe in this stuff. I do. I always have. I believe in ghosts, angels, UFOs. You name it, I believe it.\" Hawkins and Sutton said they admired their father's work ethic and his strength in dealing with the media cir- cus that followed his family's close encounter at Kelly. \"To me, in my mind, he was a hard-working kind of a man trying to raise a family who saw something out of the ordinary-something people wouldn't believe,\" Sutton said. \"He told the story and people called him a liar. I believe that was the hardest thing for him to swallow-for people to call him a dog-faced liar and not believe it.\" \"I just want people to realize that they weren't crazy,\" Hawkins added. \"They weren't just seeing things that night. Something really happened to that family.\" Kentucky the origin of term 'little green men 5 ? In an April 14, 2000, article in the Kentucky New Era, E.L. Gold reported that a French investigator, Yann Mege, was checking out the 1955 Sutton case. Apparently one of Mege's primary interests was whether or not this was the first UFO case in which aliens were described as \"little green men,\" thus giving rise to the popular use of the term by the mass media. Menge is quoted as saying that he had found the ex- pressions \"little men\" and \"green Martians\" used before the Hopkinsville case, \"but I think this is the first time they were combined to 'little green men.'\" The article says that \"green is never mentioned in early descriptions of the three-foot-tall beings that glowed in the dark...In fact, Isabel Davis, a researcher who wrote about the encounter in a 1956 book described the beings quite differently: 'The whole creature was seemingly made of silver metal that gave off an eerie light in the darkness, like the light from the radium dial on a watch.'\" Gold's article goes on to note that \"the creatures were not described as green until newspapers across the coun- try picked up the story and apparently embellished it, 're- sulting in a news item of superlative inaccuracy,' accord- ing to Davis' account.\" Report claims one in four planets outside solar system can harbor other Earths \"One in four of the planetary systems identified to date outside the Solar System are capable of harboring other Earths, say astrophysicists, a much higher proportion than anyone expected,\" reports New Scientist. The researchers decided the race to detect an extrasolar Earth-like planet is taking too long, so instead of scanning the skies, they modeled all the planetary sys- tems known so far to work out which could be hiding habitable planets. To narrow the search, Serge Tabachnik and Kristen Menou of Princeton University in New Jersey, have cre- ated computer simulations of the 85 systems known in August 2002, the time of their research, to estimate which might harbor habitable planets.

Witness describes 1966 sighting of three triangular objects Investigated by Richard Moss Minnesota MUFON Wayne Nielson of Hutchinson, MM, submitted, as re- quested, the following account of a UFO incident at Atwater, MM, which occurred during his early teens: I believe this to have happened during the fall of 1966 from late August to the end of the football season. It was during a Friday night that the high school football game was being played. My classmate friend and I had left the game before it had ended. As we came to the alley on Second Street close to the railroad tracks, my friend was about to head through the alley to his house. Just then in the cool, clear night sky we saw three elongated diamond-shaped objects in a delta formation, just above treetop level. Back then there were a lot of trees lining the road, but the alley east and west had a pretty good view. The ob- jects seemed to be lit from ambient light bouncing off of the road from the street lights. They appeared dark grey metallic, about 25' long from point to point, front to back, and perhaps 15-18 feet wide side to side. In each corner of the object I recall seeing round circular formations that reminded me of turbine- like features, but that memory is a little fuzzy. Anyway, when we saw these objects, we hid in the bushes alongside the alley and watched them slowly, si- lently glide in a true eastward direction. Because the al- ley ended at Second Street, our view was blocked by trees and houses as they continued to move east. We then ran out to Pacific Avenue, which paralleled the railroad tracks. There we had a clear view to the east and sure enough, there they were still moving at about the same slow speed. They had no lights, but still appeared as dark silouettes against the night sky. When they were about a mile east of town, they split up. One continued east, one went north, and the other went south. I remember telling my parents of the inci- dent. Recently I asked them if they had remembered the story, and they did. February 2003 Childhood sighting mystifies... (Continued from page 4) about one another, or about a common axis to be more precise. At first slowly, like two dimes on opposite edges of a 33rpm record player. But they kept accelerating un- til: they went so fast that they appeared as an amazing golden-yellow ring of light like a tiny halo in the sky! At that point, I screamed for somebody inside my house to come out and see this. My father and grandmother both came out in a matter of seconds. I couldn't take my eyes off the objects. I knew it would be fruitless to try and photograph this because we didn't own a camera sophisticated enough at that time to capture anything with any useful detail. And I knew I couldn't see the objects through my scope because I'd never get it out of the house and get it trained on them fast enough. Besides, I didn't want to miss any of this life-altering event! \"Do you see that?\" I asked my folks, \"What is that?\" They both saw it alright; and they issued the obligatory \"wows\" and \"hmms,\" but neither had any idea what it was. Whatever it was didn't seem to have much of an ef- fect on either of them. My dad mumbled something about \"flying saucers.\" they just stared and found it momen- tarily fascinating, then wandered back into the house. It was just I who was having this epiphany. The objects whirled about one another for a total of perhaps a maximum of three to four minutes. Then they decelerated smoothly to a stand-still once again. They hung motionless for another couple of minutes. Absolutely still. Absolutely silent. Then one continued on its way to the east and the other to the west, each accelerating to its original moderate speed. They quickly disappeared out of my field of view. That was it. I searched day after day for some mention in the newspaper, but found none. Perhaps no one else saw them. People, especially back then, didn't look \"up.\" I searched year after year in the UFO books and publica- tions for similar sightings. Twenty-five years later I found one! I don't recall now which of the many books it was in. In a collection of sightings, similar to Blue Book, there it was. From their description, brief as it was, two brothers in Ohio had seen the very same thing. This meant nothing more to me than that it confirmed my notion at eight years old. These were craft from somewhere else. As to what they were doing in our skies, and why they had chosen to stop right over me is a mystery which will haunt me to my dying day. Did they know I was watch- ing. Did they see me? Did they come because I was out there watching? Or were they just doing their \"thing\" and a little boy just happened to look up at the right time? I am now 61 years old, living far across the country (northern California) from Newark. While my \"sky watch- ing\" has continued, and I have seen a number of unusual sights, none has struck me as definitively as \"other worldly\" as this, nor has any affected me to anywhere near the degree this one has.

Anything that will help solve the UFO \"mystery\" should be employed. I see in the future a host of interactive tools and informa- tion that will aid investigators and researchers alike. Investigator's can now log on and simply click the cri- teria matching the information in their reports and per- form pre-evaluations of the information they have col- lected. With this tool, reports can be examined for com- pleteness, and investigators will know whether their re- ports have all essential questions asked and answered prior to submission, while at the same time putting per- centage values on the reports to indicate their \"strength.\" It must be emphasized that this is not a \"grade\" of how well an investigator researched an event, but rather an evaluation of the information collected. This project was the result of two particular circum- stances: (1) I'm studying to be a Field Investigator, and (2) I'm trying to learn Javascript. While studying the Field Investigators Manual (Sect. XVIII Part 2), I came to the Ballester-Guasp method for performing numerical evaluations of Field Investigator's reports. I thought it would be a good project for me to write some simple javascript that would perform the evalu- ation on the fly. A Ballester-Guasp evaluation takes various aspects of a report, such as Information Quality, Strangeness, and Witness Reliability, and weighs them according to a math- ematical model. For instance a 1-hour personal interview with a witness is better than a 15-minute telephone con- versation; therefore, the 1-hour interview will carry more weight.

She was able to see a pointed end, fanning out towards the form of a half circle type of configuration. She had difficulty de- scribing it, but stated a sketch would be more enlighten- ing. Efforts to stop and relocate the object were futile. It is unknown at this time whether the \"vibration\" was due to the vehicle's engine running rough or if it was caused by the craft.

He went into the local drug store and purchased a camera and film and started photographing at 5:20 PM. His taking photos of the sky caused a crowd to form and look at the UFOs flying overhead. An Air Force cap- tain, dressed in uniform, seemed amazed to see the disks. He pointed and said, \"That's not a plane!\" He claimed he was a pilot, and had never seen UFOs or anything like that. There were heavy contrails high in the sky, and the UFOs were flying around below the contrails. Matt called me immediately after the sighting and seemed quite ex- cited.

The craft flew back and forth in a straight line. The craft was a metallic silver and had one fluores- cent light. There were planes in the area, but the lights on these planes blinked, while this did not blink and moved at a comparatively slow pace. Thanks to Peter Davenport NUFORC Triangles in California SAN JOSE — Near dusk at 5:20 PM, a private pilot saw two black triangles hovering in a very slow flight pattern on Jan. 1, 2003. The sky was still bright blue, and these triangles did not fly like our planes or birds. The witness said, \"I watched for ten minutes as they headed from the east to the west, and then slowly back toward the west again. They moved progressively closer together, and appeared to be about 45,000 feet altitude. Several jumbo jets passed underneath at 15-20,000 feet during my observation. \"The flying triangles were clearly not flying like the planes, nor did they look anything like any kinds of planes I have ever seen. I am a private pilot and quite familiar with the flight patterns in this area. I have also observed many birds of prey such as hawks and eagles and these craft were not like any bird. \"This is the first time I have ever observed anything like this. I have always been extremely skeptical about UFOs and have not really thought they were anything but mistaken identities. However, these objects were clearly some kind of object that I could not identify.\" Green object in Wisconsin MARSHFIELD COUNTY— Kat R. reports that on Dec. 26, 2002, \"My husband and I were traveling with our new snowmobile, and the sky was very clear, with tiny airplanes all around, and with the Big Dipper directly ahead. \"We were somewhere north of Marshfield when at 8:50 PM, we saw a round, solid, green-colored object that came from the left side, and our first thought was that we were going to witness the crash of something. It was coming at an angle left to right, top to bottom, across the windshield! We realized it couldn't be a plane as there was only the green color. \"There was no pulsing or flashing or quirky moves, just the same speed, almost like slow motion in a sense, al- though we were so locked in to what we were seeing, time seemed to stand still; no tail like a comet, no flames, and close enough it seemed that were it a plane we would've seen the shape of the tail, etc. \"We were coming up an incline with a bank of trees, and the object appeared to be coming down, but nothing was to be seen as we rounded the bend.

Reviewed by Dwight Connelly This is one of the most interesting and important books that have come across my desk in recent years. Interest- ing because the reader is provided a rare insight into the public and private . '' life of a top-notch UFO investigator, and important because it painstakingly traces the author's evolution from a strictly \"nuts and bolts\" investigator to where he is today: not only accepting the reality of abductions, but convinced that he is himself an abductee. This once again brings up the ques- tion of how many UFO researchers are drawn into the field of ufology be- cause of a past and/or present close association with alien entities-whether consciously realized, only suspected, or even completely unaware. Aside from the very personal experiences reported by Fowler, this book can also serve as a valuable supple- mentary manual for the UFO investigator. The author dis- cusses numerous cases which he has personally investi- gated over the years, and his intense efforts to sift the crucial facts from the extraneous material is evident as he takes the reader through these cases. It was Fowler, of course, who first developed MUFON's Field Investigator's Manual more than 30 years ago, and who served several years as MUFON's Director of Investigations. Praised by Dr. J. Allen Hynek as a ufologist \"whose meticulous and detailed investigations...far exceed the investigations of Bluebook,\" Fowler has dug into some of the very best cases, including the Betty (Andreasson) Luca affair and the Allagash abductions. And it was Fowler who did the initial investigation that eventually resulted in a popular book by John Fuller, Incident at Exeter. Fowler is himself the author of nine previous books: UFOs: Interplanetary Visitors; The Andreasson Affair, The Andreasson Affair-Phase Two; Casebook of a UFO Investigator; The Melchizedek Connection; The Watchers; The Allagash Abductions; Watchers II; and The Andreasson Legacy. He received the B.A. (magna cum laude) in Liberal Arts from Gordon College, served with the U.S. Air Force Security Service, and worked for 25 years with GTE Government Systems as a senior planner for the Minute- man Intercontinental Missile Program. He built and has directed his own planetarium and observatory. It is important to look at this background if one is to appreciate the significance of Fowler's evolution over the several decades he has worked as a ufologist. He was known for his careful approach to cases, and admits, for example, that he was quite skeptical of the Betty and Barney Hill case when it was first revealed. Only gradu- ally did he somewhat reluctantly report what he consid- ered the more bizarre cases to NICAP, the UFO group he was initially affiliated with. But as time went on, the evidence for abductions and other seemingly \"far out\" aspects of ufology grew stron- ger, both for him and for ufology in general. More signifi- cant from his personal viewpoint, the abduction cases trig- gered memories of strange nighttime experiences as a youth. Eventually he underwent hypno- sis, hoping to get answers. This process was-and is-painful, es- pecially since Fowler's work with UFOs (and particularly his belief that he may be an abductee) is very upsetting to his wife. His grown children are also very upset that their father, who once was a divinity student and who brought them up as religious fundamentalists, is now possibly flirting with something that could be related to Satan. The family pressure on him is now so great, in fact, that he has given up the idea of having a possible implant in his nose removed, and he is retiring from active work in ufology-though he continues to be a mem- ber of MUFON. This is a very large book, and it covers some very large subjects. Fowler's investigations have taken him into the possible relationship between UFOs and power black- outs, UFOs and the disabling of missile sites, and even possible UFO crashes in New York and Mexico. He tells of his experience with the famous Colorado Project (Condon committee), which was an alleged \"sci- entific study\" of UFOs financed by the Air Force, but was actually a project designed to debunk UFOs. Having spent several years as an investigator for NICAP, he is in a position to look with some authority at the ouster of Don Kehoe from that organization, and the possibility that NICAP was intentionally disrupted and killed from within by CIA infiltrators in 1980. There is more in this book, of course. Much more. The one thing lacking in this 528-page testament is an index, and there are numerous proofreading errors which distract just a bit. However, this is a tremendous book, and one that no serious student of ufology should miss. Highly recommended. \"Out of the Blue,\" narrated by Peter Coyote, 2002, FCZ Media (James Fox, Tim Coleman, & Boris Zubov), VHS or DVD, 95 minutes, $19.95 for VHS, $24.95 for DVD, $34.95 for both, Pay Pal, customerservice@outoftheblue.TV, www.outoftheblue.TV.

All views are seemingly of equal value in this presentation. \"Out of the Blue\" presents an overview of ufology, not an analysis of credibility, and nowhere is this more clear than with the numerous movie, video, and still photos of \"UFOs\"from China, Russia, Mexico, Oregon, the UK, Germany, California, etc. The Mexico City video, which is a proven hoax, is given as much prominence as the McMinnville photo, which has stood the test of time and thorough investigation. Only at the very end of the film is there the statement that the images of UFOs \"could not be validated,\" and that \"the validity is left to viewer discretion.\" Fine for the experienced ufologist; not so fine for the neophyte who doesn't notice the disclaimer. Even so, this is a good film which professionally pre- sents a comprehensive overview of ufology. It would be a welcome feature at a local MUFON meeting-and one which would be bound to generate spirited discussion. At the 2002 International UFO Congress convention, \"Out of the Blue\" won the \"Best UFO Documentary- Long Subject\" award, as well as \"The People's Choice\" award.

The debate, in which I deliberately did not participate, demonstrates both the good and bad aspects of the internet when it comes to doing UFOlogy. Indeed, but for the magazine editor putting the article onto the World Wide Web, it is unlikely my article in its raw state would have stirred up the wasps nest that it did- for it instantly transformed a piece probably read by a few dozen into one read by thou- sands, most of whom seem- ingly had a view to express about it! This is no bad thing when it comes to any article offering positive ideas to develop the future of UFOlogy. The article itself posed the question as to whether UFOlogy, which is clearly struggling in ways that it has never faced before, might be in terminal decline-or was simply going through what Jacques Vallee once called \"the Dark Ages\" after a spell of lethargy in the late 1950s, early 1960s when UFO interest was moribund for a while. Back then a wave of sightings and the Apollo space program kick-started an explosion of interest which only now has time (and a sea of digital TV channels with a never ending diet of pop UFOlogy) begun to erode. Many commentators, based only upon reading the few sentences extracted from my article posted onto the net, began a discussion which rapidly turned into a battle over whether I was right or wrong to proclaim UFOlogy as being D.O.A. In reality, had they read my article in full (as I suspect few of them did), they would have seen that I was making no such claim, and that they were missing the main purpose of the article itself. This is not the first time that things I have written have been used by others woefully out of context. I will not go into details save to say that once this had devastating consequences, thus showing that it is the meaning of words in full that really matters, and not an interpretation of a short extract viewed without that context altogether. Unfortunately, the ease of communication, speed of response, and terse nature of the cybernetic medium (where nuance and emotional background-not to men- tion irony or humor-are often tough to decipher) com- bine to make internet communications inferior to real writ- ing (such as here in the MUFON UFO Journal). It is actually teaching us to jump the gun, to be lazy and to make assumptions that are not necessarily true whilst seeing issues in stark terms minus the subtleties that nearly always are required to make clear what the point of any argument ought to be. There is no substitute for the UFO conference, even if we might try a real time virtual UFO conference sooner or later. UFOlogy is very much about subtleties and a need to consider a wealth of possibilities, not merely to fasten onto one idea and stick to it. My point was not that UFOlogy is forever dead (as many seem to think I was saying), nor indeed that the internet is bad for us (another point often seized upon, but also not what my article was alleging). An opportunity, not a disaster: We ought to be viewing the current hiatus in positive terms, not negative ones. I have little doubt that the day of the UFO will dawn again when something happens to create wider public in- terest. For instance, the proven discovery of alien mi- crobes under the Martian soil would cause millions to se- riously ponder whether intelligent alien life might be out there-in many cases for the first time-and UFOlogy, rightly or wrongly, would be included in their remit once more. So it is not a matter of writing off the subject, but analysing why we are suffering a downturn. For a lot of it is our fault. In my view one key point is that the public has dealt with the fact that after 50 years of big promises we are no nearer to proving what UFOs are-certainly not in any exotic terms. (I do think we have made real progress in more mundane aspects of UFOlogy). Ergo, we should be looking at ways to reinvent our- selves in a manner fit for the 21st century, seeking new methods of doing UFOlogy that offer hope of better progress when interest and money comes around the next time. My article has some ideas, but very few commen- tators even mentioned them because they never got past reading the extracted quote and getting all aireated over what they thought I said. Harnessing the net As for the internet being a disaster for UFOlogy-not a bit of it. I pointed out some of the downside: it is making mainstream UFO literature (books and magazines) harder to survive, and it is courting a lot of trivial discussion and chat (although some good and useful chat as well, of course). But there are massive advantages that in general we have failed to grasp as fully as we might do. These in- clude the harnessing of the net for pro active UFOlogy. Why do we have 1000 chat lists endlessly discussing what Page 18 MUFON UFO Journal February 2003"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"happened in the New Mexican desert 60 years ago and virtually no sites devoted to UFO window areas where events are occurring right now-with, for instance, 24/7 monitor cameras allowing virtual skywatches to be con- ducted? Here is a perfect way to use the power of the net, but UFOlogy tends on the whole to see its potential as merely an extension of what we have always done: talk to one another about the good old days of UFOlogy. The net certainly is advantageous for such discussions, and amidst the general chat lists (which tend to recycle similar topics every couple of years) there are a few well adapted lists set up for a specific purpose. For instance, to present all of the evidence (not just people's views, but case documents, site photos, etc-in effect a kind of virtual book) exclusively about one key case and focus debate on progressing the investigation of that case. Progress in the UK Wonders are being worked in the UK on lists part way towards this ideal discussing, for example, the Rendlesham Forest 1980 or Lakenheath-Bentwaters 1956 episodes. And this is a still very under utilised way in which we can make the internet work for us. But there are other ways of doing virtual UFOlogy that do not seem to have been attempted. For example, there are very few sites devoted to of- fering any kind of diagnostic tool to the investigator. Why not? The net is perfectly suited for such a thing. IFO Finder: There ought to be sophisticated data bases avail- able on line that include interactive lists of solved cases designed to allow UFOlogists to compare their ongoing investigations with this information. If you had a case and could type in the parameters to this site, then it ought to let you cross reference to similar cases already on file somewhere and suggest to you vari- ous identifications based on previously solved cases that you ought to be considering. It is a logical way of using new technology to facilitate global UFOlogy. So why is nobody doing it? This kind of site-what we might call an IFO Finder-is a perfect way of mobilizing the strength of the UFO community on a broad scale, sharing resources, harnessing the power of the net, and using it to provide a powerful tool that simply could not be made available by any other way. I first suggested this idea when I was working as a director with BUFORA (British UFO Research Asso- ciation) about 12 years ago. Back then the computer revo- lution was in its early days. Then it would have been very crude and would have had to be released as a product on disk and distributed to UFO groups or individuals in that limited form. Now it could be far more powerful and interactive and with the might of the internet set up for instant global access. It could even be a wonderful PR opportunity for UFOlogy because we could offer it to the public as a self diagnostic tool using the fruits of 50 years of our UFOlogical labors. We then might come over as slightly serious and edu- cative, rather than merely as crackpots trying to prove a government conspiracy, as is all too often our lot these days. A witness could plug in his or her own sighting, get referred to similar sightings \"out there\" in virtual reality, and be offered various possible solutions that they might contemplate and that could turn their UFO sighting into an IFO. Not a waste of time As we know, the vast majority of UFOs are indeed really IFOs, so this tool would hardly be a waste of time. Indeed it would free us up to concentrate on the cases that truly merit such effort. So why is this not being done? Probably because it takes time, work, and coordination. And whilst the net allows us to chat to people thou- sands of miles away as if they were next door, we as a subject have yet to extend this global community thinking into anything akin to a working partnership of serious UFOlogists. We lack a sense of international respect or partnership. We are still living as separate groups with separate aims. If every major group nominated one person to work on this project, then IFO Finder could be up and running within a year, giving at the same time a clear statement to the skeptics community who often vociferously argue that we have failed to provide anything scientificlly useful at all after 50 years. This is a simple project to reject that claim out of hand. If we create IFO Finder, then we might really get our act together and create other useful joint ventures. It has to be the right way forward. If not, then some commer- cial enterprise will doubtless cream off ideas like this, as they do now with the commodity that UFOlogy has be- come-to create a CD ROM of IFO Finder and sell it for $50 a pop whilst UFOlogy sits arguing yet again about what really happened at Roswell before most of those arguing were even born.

Friedman Frank Kaufmann I first heard about Frank Kaufmann as an important Roswell witness at a meeting in Chicago about a decade ago. The meeting was sponsored by FUFOR and CUFOS. Its ostensible purpose was to discuss the saucer crash in the Plains of San Agustin in New Mexico in early July 1947. The Plains are over 100 miles west over a moun- tain pass from the Foster Ranch crash site described by Maj. Jesse Marcel and others. The meeting, which CUFOS had postponed twice at the last minute, was to review the testi- mony of Gerald Anderson, who had come forword after hearing the Unsolved Mysteries program's second broadcast in January, 1990.1 had instigated the program , first broadcast in Sep- tember, 1989, and was given ac- cess to many people who called the toll free number. Gerald had plane tickets for the first two proposed meetings, but didn't make it third time around. His testimony is discussed in Crash at Corona. There was a lot of animosity (Kevin Randle wouldn't even shake my hand) because Don Berliner and I were defending the Plains crash first heard about from people who heard the story from Civil Engineer Barney Barnett. He had told his good friends Vern and Jean Maltais and his wife's niece Alice Knight, and neighbor Harold Baca. It appeared that CUFOS was dead set against a crash in the Plains, for reasons I have never understood, and were talking primarily to Kevin Randle and Don Schmitt about their new witness, Frank Kaufmann (two aliases were used for reasons unknown). Frank supposedly was a member of an elite military group of nine which had tremendous power to go any- where and do anything and were very heavily involved in the Roswell Incident-except Frank came up with a new location North of Roswell and off Highway 285 to the west and much closer to town than the Foster ranch. Supposedly, Frank had been sent over to White Sands by Gen. Martin Scanlon of the Air Defense Command (his ADC role was head of Public Affairs at Mitchell Field\" in NY!) to watch the radar scope there because there had beeri radar observations of strange craft North of Roswell... even though the distance was greater than the range of the radar, and ADC had no radar in NM in 1947/ r The rocket guys at WS generally used tracking, not search, radar. He was on duty for 24 hours (very doubt- ful). They observed the screen fill with light indicating an explosion north of Roswell.. Frank was later one of the team that went out from Roswell, even though he was just a civilian clerk, having left the service in October, 1945. The story had many permutations, all centered around Frank's very important role. The evidence, to say the least, was minimal. It was a very highly classified event, but here Frank was spilling his guts about seeing the damaged craft on the ground and several bodies near it. Military people had kept in touch with him all this time. He couldn't tell us who was running the show, but he could describe, and then draw, the downed craft and the alien bodies! Don Schmitt knew that I was very dubious about Frank's stories, and in July, 1995, when we were both in Roswell, arranged for me to talk to Frank. We were in my room at the old Roswell Inn: Frank, Don, and Kevin. I was not allowed to tape the session. Frank spun his tale, including being in touch with the Roswell base from White Sands, having somebody at the Roswell Army Air Field go north, and seeing a glow in the sky west of Highway 285. Frank dashed back over the mountains and woke Col. Blanchard and Maj. Marcel. They all drove north, and went off the highway through fences and gullies in the middle of the night where there are scorpions and rattlesnakes. After several miles they came across the saucer with a gash in its side and bodies near it on the ground. Frank, who was an excellent artist, drew the bodies, which were much more like Earthlings and bigger than other reported descriptions of the aliens. The craft was triangular and had octagonal energy cells on the bottom. They contacted the base and a flatbed truck was sent out cross country as well, and by morning was back at the base with the wreckage and bodies. This story made no sense to me. If Jesse Marcel had gone out that Saturday night and seen bodies and wreck- age of a strange vehicle, surely he would have responded very differently later on Sunday, July 6, when he was called by Sheriff Wilcox about rancher Brazel and his strange wreckage. Surely, I said, Blanchard as commander of the 509 th , the only atomic bombing group in the world, would have waited until morning when a spotter plane could have immediately determined what had crashed. How could he leave his post without knowing what was there? Frank said there were no spotter planes. (There were). How could a flatbed truck get out, get the wreckage on board, and be back to base after many miles cross country, by morning? Surely in all plane crash investiga- tions one wants to be able to study pieces in situ and to photograph before moving anything. There was certainly no fear about tourists or others coming across the wreck- age in the middle of nowhere. And why Frank?

Kevin and I were embattled both at the meeting and in a discussion right afterward. Don and Frank had left. Kevin said he could refute all my com- plaints of his false claims in a paper (MUFON 1995 \"Roswell Revisited.\") He could not. He skilfully constructed scenarios to explain the Plains case away, drawing on his experience in writing more than 6 dozen books of fiction. Barney must have lied to his wife (accounting for her \"false\" entry in her diary), and rather than being over in the Plains had been at the debris field East of Corona. I pointed out that her diary gave not one instance when Barney worked east of Socorro that whole year. Kevin claimed the debris field was in Barney's district. I checked with the SCS. It was not. He tried everything possible over the years to discredit Gerald, who didn't help matters any by changing a phone bill after he had been told that Kevin was saying bad things about him and had changed a time on a picture. Kevin claimed the only reason Gerald came up with a Dr. Buskirk as the anthropologist he saw out in the Plains was that Gerald had taken a course under Buskirk at Albuquerque High School. He even has repeatedly falsely claimed that a student in that class had said Gerald was in it. I talked to the student, Larry Henning, five times. Not only had he not told Kevin that Gerald was in the class, but he, and sev- eral other fellow students who were in the class looked at Gerald's picture in the AHS yearbook, and said they had no recollection of him. Frank had of course in effect backed up Kevin by claim- ing that, through his inside information, he knew that the Barnett story was a diversion to distract people from the Kaufmann's site. But there was never any mention of the Barnett story until The Roswell Incident was published in 1980. Meanwhile, Frank was spilling more tales. He named some members of the oversight committee (None had been verified). He said he couldn't name any others. He did show pictures, especially one with him and a bunch of military officers, and another with members of the group of nine. There was no indication of what the pictures meant. Frank, who had become affiliated with the Roswell Chamber of Commerce, might have been guarding them? Escorting them on a town tour? There is a picture of Frank being given a medal in the 1947 Base yearbook, though Frank was not in uniform. Turns out it was a medal ev- erybody who was in the military during WWII received. Frank attended a meeting of many of the investigators and Roswell witnesses arranged by a Japanese film crew. Each witness (Loretta Proctor, Dr. Jesse Marcel, Opera- tions Officer Shirkey, undertaker Glenn Dennis) was asked to describe the wreckage they had seen. I was astonished to hear Frank say the wreckage was just as described by Dr. Marcel!! Jesse hadn't been at the crash site, had only been eleven years old at the time, and had seen only some pieces of wreckage, not an al- most intact craft. This made no sense to me. A witness to a truly extraordinary event deferring to somebody who was quite young and hadn't been out there, and whose father never said anything about an almost intact craft, only debris!! Frank was very much of a name dropper, seemingly knowing all kinds of important people. He claimed to be close to Maj. Marcel, though only a sergeant. Yet Dr. Marcel had no recollection of Frank at all, despite re- membering Counter Intelligence Corps members Cavitt, Rickett, and Yeager. Later on, Frank was upset when I told him I had ob- tained a brief record of his military career showing noth- ing after he left the service in 1945. He had claimed being in the paramilitary... .and said his records had been burned up in the big fire. I sent him a copy of what I had ob- tained. Frank had written me expressing anger at my com- ments about him in various letters and a paper or two. But never was there real evidence for any of his claims. I had noted early on that Anderson had passed a poly- graph examination. Frank had never taken one. The museum for several years has had a big copy on the wall of a letter from a member of the McKnight fam- ily which had owned the supposed crash site prior to it being sold to the Corn family not too many years ago. The letter notes that there was, in 1947, no way to get to the crash site except by horseback. There had also been no talk among the ranchers, as there had been near the Foster ranch operated by Mac Brazel where the debris field was. Finally, in December, 1999, when I was in town for a meeting of advisors to the International UFO Museum and Research Center, Frank wanted to see me. We met for breakfast. He made sure I would be at a later meeting at his home with Linda Moulton Howe, Don Schmitt, and (for 90% of the time) Dennis Balthaser, a very active Roswell researcher who lives in Roswell and had been very closely associated with the museum. Frank was sweetness and light this time. He knew he had very serious cancer. A number of his paintings were on the walls. Since the tone was very friendly, I asked, \"Frank, did Col. Blanchard go out with you to the crash site?\" No. \"Did Maj. Marcel go with you to the crash site?\" No. I mentioned these comments in my notes of the meet- ing, which were sent to the others present. I asked for corrections. None were given. This exchange is in my MUFON 2000 paper \"Roswell and Operation Majestic 12 in the New Millennium,\" July, 2000. I also noted that Frank's drawing of a supposedly tri- angular-shaped craft looked almost exactly like drawings of the TR-3 plane that appeared in Popular Mechanics and Aviation Week and Space technology in 1991, well before Frank had made his drawing-even to the beehive- type segments on the bottom. In July, 2001, after Frank's death a few months earlier, Don Schmitt told me, in confidence, of finding papers at Frank's home that indicated that Frank had substantially changed the few records describing his military record February 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"and his involvement. He asked me not to talk at that time, because of sympathy for the family. Frank's wife was not in good health, there were grandchildren, etc. Juanita Kaufmann died, and then suddenly there was word that tell-all articles were on the internet to be pub- lished in the CUFOS International UFO Reporter by Dr. Kevin Randle, \"Frank Kaufmann: Roswell Witness,\" and CUFOS Director Dr. Mark Rodeghier, \"Frank Kaufmann: Roswell Hoaxer,\" exposing the forgeries and basically discounting everything Frank had ever said-but without notification of the family, nor permission to have the documents. I had noted on UFO Updates (Internet) that Frank had basically admitted that he had lied in his description of events when he said that neither Blanchard nor Marcel had gone to the crash site. Kevin said this wasn't admit- ting to lying!! The articles detail some of the specifics of the fraud, do not give Don Schmitt any credit for the discoveries, and basically excuse Kevin's not paying any attention to previous criticisms of Frank on the basis that \"Challenges from the outside seemed born more of politics inside the UFO field than of investigative analysis.\" I am truly saddened by this whole business because much of The Truth about the UFO Crash at Roswell (Randle and Schmitt) is built on Frank's testimony. The first portion of Randle's new book \"Case MJ-12\" (Harper Collins, Torch 2002) is also based on Frank's false claims. Many people had placed Frank at the center of the Roswell story with important revelations. If he falls, many of those people will say, \"Well, there was also nothing to Roswell.\" Frank doesn't figure at all in the story told in The Roswell Incident or Crash at Corona. If there is a moral to the story, it is a statement by President Reagan: \"Trust, but verify.\" Frank was charm- ing, extroverted, and clever, as most con men are. I ex- pect he has been laughing in his grave all the while at how he so easily pulled the wool over so many eyes. Record year of UFO sighting reports in Italy for 2002 The Italian Center for UFO Studies (Centra Italiano Studi Ufologici, CISU) reports, \"The drop in reports in the month of December notwithstanding, 2002 went out as a record-setting year for sightings and reports of UFO phenomena in Italy.\" The number of case histories gathered and filed to- taled 724 for last year, compared with the 796 which made the preceding 2001 one of the richest periods of the last 24 years. It is expected that in the coming months, as usual; the total cases for 2002 will grow to surpass that of 2001, which at this point a year ago saw \"only\" 630 cases. The month-by-month distribution of sightings for 2002 was less spotty than that for 2001, which was much more centered around a summer flap. Lombardy and Emilia- Romagna were the richest regions for reports, followed by Veneto and Tuscany; and the usual prevalence of Northern Italy, with 56% of the observations. Robert and Ryan Wood produce new documentary on Majestic 12 documents A new documentary, \"The Secret Evidence We Are Not Alone,\" produced by Dr. Robert Wood and son Ryan Wood, aired on The Discovery Channel in Canada Jan. 16. Dr. Wood explains that the presentation \"provides evi- dence for government cover-up of extraterrestrials, fur- ther exposing the Top Secret Operation Majestic 12.\" The Woods have been researching the MJ-12 documents for several years, and the current one-hour documentary was developed over a period of two years. No specific licensing agreement has been concluded yet-for showing the documentary in the US. \"When we know the date and time of a US or other foreign country airing, we will post it to our website at www.majesticdocuments.com and send out a specific press release,\" said Dr. Wood. \"The program covers new ground,\" explains Ryan Wood, \"with a hard look at the Majestic 12 documents and their authenticity from multiple expert perspectives. 'The Secret' presents the story of how 'leaked' govern- ment documents prove that the United States has been recovering crashed unidentified flying objects, often known as flying saucers, since 1941.\" He adds, \"These documents have been examined us- ing forensic techniques, and are declared genuine by those who examine the subtleties of paper, ink age, watermark, type fonts, classification stamps, and markings. This pro- gram is not a rehash of the old Roswell crash scenarios, providing evidence that the first U.S. crash was in Mis- souri in 1941. A short interview with one of the principal sources of this Missouri crash retrieval can be viewed at: www.majesticdocuments.com/documentary.html. Wood says, \"Not only does this show have some dis- tinguished advocates taking compelling supportive posi- tions, such as Astronaut Ed Mitchell, and researchers Stanton Friedman, Timothy Good, and Michael Lindemann, but some dissenting views are included from skeptical comers.

After much delibera- tion, MUFON's Board of Directors has determined that appropriate advertising will significantly benefit our orga- nization, as it does other scientifically-oriented groups. Since MUFON dues are only $35 per year, the Board feels that advertising is needed to generate additional in- come. Advertising will also allow readers to be informed about books and other products that may be of interest. The MUFON UFO Journal is committed to providing quality advertising, and will not accept ads that do not meet certain standards. It was this concern, in fact, which resulted in the Board's decision some years ago to elimi- nate advertising in the Journal. MUFON is also committed to restricting the amount of advertising in the Journal, adding pages where neces- sary to preserve and even expand editorial content. Advertisers should contact John Schuessler at MUFON. P.O. Box 369. Littleton, CO 80465-0369, or call 303-932-7709. The rate card and ad deadlines appear below. At this time, only black and white ads will be accepted. Clifford Clift, MUFON director, has been instrumental in working out details of the new advertising program.

New Field Investigators Kathleen Marden, Director for Field Investigator Training, has announced that the following Field Investi- gator Trainees have completed the Field Investigator's Exam and are now MUFON Field Investigators: Brice Buehler, Phoenix, AZ, and Lynn Stratton. St. Peters- burg, FL. All Field Investigator Trainees are urged to study the MUFON Field Investigator s Manual and take the exam. The manual provides guidelines for UFO investigations and reporting. It is available from MUFON Headquar- ters for $25 plus $3.50 p&h in the U.S. Add $4.00 for orders shipped outside the United States. The exam is available from MUFON Headquarters and is mailed free to trainees when they have completed their studies. Position Announcements The new State Director for Colorado is Leslie Varnicle. Leslie first joined MUFON in 1979 and has extensive investigative, ham radio, and flying experience. As one of her first duties she announced a campout/in- vestigator training session to be held in the San Luis Val- ley of Colorado in June. The valley has become known as a hot bed of UFO activity and cattle mutilations. We thank Lin Simpson, MUFON Director for Mem- bership, for her work as acting Colorado State Director for the past many months. David Hillendahl has accepted the position of State Section Director for the Texas counties of Travis and Williamson. He is already SSD for Austin County. Donations to the MUFON Archives Kenneth Ewing, Los Alamos, NM, has donated yet another package of clippings, science articles, and UFO newsletters/magazines to the MUFON archives. Additional books were donated to MUFON by Judith Jones of Montpelier, VT and Nicholas Roesler, Mil- waukee, WI. Nick bids on UFO books on eBay, with instructions to mail them directly to MUFON Headquar- ters. We thank these members for their generosity. Article Submission One of our goals is to use the pages of the MUFON UFO Journal and the MUFON website at www.mufon.com to share as much UFO information as possible. State Directors, Consultants, Research Spe- cialists, National Directors. Country Representatives, Field Investigators and writers are urged to submit the results of their work for possible publication. While we are not interested in attacks on other indi- viduals or groups, we welcome investigated reports, his- torical articles, and speculation if it is science-based. Our goal is unity in the UFO field and sharing information. New Books by MUFON Members In addition to writing in the pages of the MUFON UFO Journal, a number of MUFON members go the extra mile and make the results of their work available in book form. This month I would like to mention books by two of the speakers scheduled for the 2003 MUFON Inter- national UFO Symposium. Beyond UFO Secrecy by John Greenewald, Jr., is the story of \"The Black Vault's\" pursuit of the truth. John is probably best known for his excellent web site at http:/ /www.blackvault.com that now includes over 107.000 pages of UFO-related material obtained directly from the files of the U.S. Government through the Freedom of Information Act. This labor of love should not be missed. 5000 Years of UFOs-Are We Really Alone by Jim Hickman documents what he calls his \"strange journey\" that started with his own close encounter at age 7 and continues. In addition to being an active UFO investiga- tor, Jim has his own radio show \"The Hickman Report\" and an excellent website at http:// www.thehickmanreport.com.
