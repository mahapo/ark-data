FROM THE EDITOR The article by Stuart Campbell which tends to discredit the Extra- terrestrial Hypothesis (ETH) is a truly provocative one, well worth fol- low-up dialogue that I hope will be forthcoming. Campbell touches on all the presuppositions (dare I say \"assumptions\"?) that make extra- terrestrial visitation seem unlikely if not impossible. It appears to me, however, that Campbell is rather free with his own assumptions, which I shall refrain from pointing out in the hope that informed and ob- servant readers will respond for publication. In fact, I invite and urge reader response in this particular case, since Campbell has managed to incorporate just about every conceivable anti-ETH argument yet advanced. His own assumptions need to be examined. The pages of the Journal are open for full discussion of the issues he raises.

Preliminary details only are provided as both cases are still under active investigation. The physical trace case happened on the \"White Acres\" property just to the West of Sale in Victoria, Southern Australia. At 1 a.m. on the morning of September 30, 1980, Mr. George Blackwell, a station hand, awoke and immediately noted a noise like a whistling sound, unlike the noise which comes from the nearby Princes Highway, a main road between Syndey and Melbourne which carries interstate traffic. There were also noises which he ascribed to cattle bellowing and a horse running around in a panic. He got out of bed and went out- side. Climbing up onto a rail to look over an obstructing roof top he noted an unusual object approaching from the southwest. He estimated its height to be about 2-3 metres above the ground, and it appeared to pass behind a shed but in front of a hedge- row of trees, at a distance he believed to be about 180 metres. Then it passed between a silo and a tree. From there it progressed some one kilometre or so to a concrete water tank where it seemed to hover for about a minute. From the tank it moved northwards and to him appeared to come to rest on the ground about the same distance from the house as the tank. Initially as soon as he saw it he thought it was an aircraft about to crash but when it passed by the silo he saw that it had no wings nor tail. At that time there was a full Moon and a clear sky and he had a good view of it. He did not note any illu- mination of the ground as the object passed over the terrain. It was de- scribed as like a top. It was spinning and there were blue and orange lights visible coming from it. Its size was estimated as 8 metres across. An ac- curate description at various stages of the observation is currently not avail- able in these preliminary notes. Mr. Blackwell decided to see what was going on and got dressed, then mounted his motorcycle and rode up to the area, opening farm gates as he went. The object remained visible on the ground close by the water tank as he rode. It continued to make the whistling noise all the time. When he was within 50 metres or so he felt an odd sensation within his body which he could only describe as making him feel \"like a plate of jelly.\" He opened a final gate and rode to a spot which he reckons was only about 15 m from the object. The noise was now so loud that he covered his ears with his hands and sat on the motorcycle resting his legs on the ground. There were no effects noticed at any time on the bike. The object was clearly visible sitting on the ground still making the sound. After a few minutes it gave out an awful bang, there was a blast of air and heat, and then it lifted off the ground and moved away to the east. It then went silent and a shower of debris fell from underneath it to the ground. By this time it was some 10 m east of the site. Mr. Blackwell rode his bike onto the spot where it had been and watched, stunned. This was the closest approach to it. It travelled eastwards gradually becoming smaller in size until it was lost to his view. He arrived back home at 1:50 a.m. and noted that his watch had stopped at 1:10 ajn. He had a cup of coffee, found that his watch would go if placed on the table but stopped whenever he put it back on his wrist. Then he went and lay on his bed still fully clothed, although he couldn't get to sleep properly. He woke up at 5 a jn. and went to have a look at the spot to convince himself that it had really happened. Arriving there he relates finding a 46 cm wide black ring some 8.5 metres across with green grass to the outside and inside. East of this was a scatter- ing of debris, cow pads, and rocks. There were also, he relates, six evenly spaced half spokes around the circum- ference of the circle pointing towards the centre of the circle. At 9 a.m. the owner of the prop- erty came by and together they in- spected the site noting the damage. This inspection was followed by nu- merous others, including one 2 weeks after the event by Paul Norman, MUFON state representative for Vic- toria. It is hoped his report will be available shortly. A short report was published in the December issue of the VUFORS 1 Bulletin, 1980. The authors, respectively MUFON Continental Coordinator and State Representative for New South Wales, and Garry Little, private investigator, travelled to the site during December to conduct an on-site investigation. Mr. Blackwell, although he had re- ceived visits from all sorts of people, graciously provided an in-depth report on the night's events. Soil and rock samples were removed for analysis by a consultant of the Australian Centre for UFO Studies. 2 An extensive report is currently being prepared as in total the event involves a one-witness close encounter, a mark, effects on the witness and his watch, other trace effects in ad- jacent paddocks, effects on stock, the disappearance of 10,000 gallons of water from the tank, and a possible second witness. Details will be docu- mented in due course and provided to MUFON.

My designation of this case as a \"probable abduction\" - despite the absence of any hypnotically-retrieved confirmation — is deliberate. Obvious- ly, since a huge number of close en- counters in remote areas can be fairly regarded as possible abductions, the term \"possible\" carries little descrip- tive weight. I prefer to use the classi- fication \"probable abduction\" in close encounter cases in which one or more of these situations occur: A definitely recollected time lapse or period of amnesia; recurrent dreams or con- scious flashbacks of an abduction ex- perience; an unexplained incision, in- jury, or physical mark associated with a time and/or.space dislocation, and so forth. According to these criteria the reader will easily understand why the following CEIH case has been des- ignated a probable abduction. On November 13, 1979,1 was the guest of Betty Ramey, owner of Rock- land County radio station WPKL, on her call-in interview program. It was the third time in 2 years that we had discussed the subject of UFOs on WPKL; surprisingly, each of the earlier programs had brought to light at least one case which strongly implied a buried abduction experience. At the very end of our November 13 inter- view a woman called in at the sugges- tion of her husband (as she later explained) to report a \"strange, peculiar experience\" she had had as a child. She was, however, reluctant to describe it, and as our time was running out Betty Ramey asked that she leave her phone number off-mike, and I called her later that afternoon. Something about her hesitation, and the tone of uncertainty in her voice, was intriguing. The incident occurred in a small town near Spring Valley, perhaps 30 miles from Manhattan. The witness, whom I shall call Ellen Sutter, told me the encounter took place when she was about 9 years old. SJie had been outside playing on an overcast summer afternoon when she 'noticed a flash of light, \"like the reflection of sun on a metallic object. It kind of blinded me, and I was startled and looked up. There was a big oak tree outside our property, and above the tree was something huge, shaped like a dirigible, with many, many port- holes, and, you know, this peculiar light. \"It was just like I was rooted to the spot. All of a sudden these peculiar things. . a few, I don't recall how many, came out of it and seemed to be. . .floating. This is why I never told anyone, because, as I said, it sounds a dream. These people - I call them people; I don't know what they were — looked like a diving suit with a head shape at the top and a very distorted, short-looking body. It was weird. Very, very weird. At the time I kept thinking, my gosh, they're on ropes or something. You know, the way a child thinks. And they eventually got back into the thing and it went off, (Continued on next page) (Australia, Continued) Radar-Visual Case The radar/visual event occurred on December 4, 1980. News media reports alerted us to the event which was initially reported as a visual ob- servation at Perth airport, Western Australia, and radar confirmation. The incident is currently being jointly investigated by Jeff Bell of UFO Re- search (WA) and the Australian Centre for UFO Studies. Upon hearing of the event, letters were immediately sent to the Depart- ment of Transport whose staff were involved and to the Royal Australian Air Force which is the relevant govern- ment body responsible for UFO re- ports, requesting confirmation of the event and details of it. The Department of Transport WA responded to Jeffs query by confirm- ing \"that an unexplained sighting was made on 4th December 1980 at Perth Airport and that the sighting was made by officers of the Department.\" They advised that there was \"no docu- mentary evidence of the sighting ex- cept for a telex message from Perth airport.\" Other details advised that \"the objects were never stationary while under observation\"; \"there were no reports from aircraft of any sight- ings\"; and \"there were no disruptions to aircraft operations because of the sightings.\" The short telex was released to us and basically relates that objects glinting in the Sun were seen for 15 minutes on December 4 and that a radar paint of a matching target(s) was obtained. The nearby RAAF base radar was unmanned at the time and thus there is no independent radar confirmation. The returns were lost in the radar cone of silence. The tower observed four objects; radar had four returns. Initially the objects were at 26,000 ft. and later at 72,000 ft. A reply received from the De- partment by the Centre also contained a copy of the telex and agreement for a Centre representative to interview the main air traffic controller. Jeff Bell will interview the controller shortly, and there is a possibility of locating two independent visual observers. A more complete report will be made in due course. NOTES 1. VUFORS, P. O.

And I thought, 'Oh, I'm losing my mind! It's a dream!' And yet over the years it's something that's always been with me. Many times the mem- ory of it has come back to me.\" Some of Ellen's recollections have a subtle precision, such as her descrip- tion of the shape of the craft's win- dows: \"They were peculiar in shape .. they weren't exactly rectangular. Their shape may have been determined, by the contour of the object, if you know what I mean. They could have been rectangular up close. And these 'people' came out of an opening below the window section, through some- thing like a trap door. They just seemed to walk around like you or I would. . .up in the air. Their color was not a color with which I was famil- iar. You wouldn't say gray, you wouldn't say stiver, you wouldn't say blue, do you know what I mean? Everything gave me the impression of being all metal, and that was frighten- ing, too. Metal, but of what sort I have no idea.\" These figures, Ellen insisted, never came down to the ground; they merely floated about some 30 or 40 feet off the ground. I asked her how long she watched them. \"I have no idea. I do remember at the time that my mother scolded me for having been gone so long. 'Where have you been, what have you been doing', things like that.\" But despite her scolding Ellen never told her mother what she had seen, nor did she ever tell anyone else until years later, when she informed her husband. The presence of a time lapse is strong- ly implied, as is the suggestion of an unconscious injunction not to tell anyone about her experience. Later, when I pointed out how strange it seemed that she never told her mother what had delayed her, even as a simple act of self-defense in the light of her reprimand, she said this: \"I thought no one would believe me. And also I felt that it was something I couldn't reveal at that time. It was almost like a secret that 1 should keep.\" I asked Ellen what her reactions were immediately after the encounter. \"I was afraid for quite a while afterwards. Very much afraid. For weeks afterwards. I was afraid of being alone. . .of it happening again. I wanted to have a feeling of safety all the time. I didn't feel safe.\" Ellen said that she had a \"special place\" in the attic where she could go to be by herself and to read; for many months after the incident she was afraid to go there alone. A second reaction was even more suggestive: she developed an intense fear of falling til, of having to visit a doctor or go to the hospital. This feeling was accompanied by a dread of having caught some horrify- ing disease from the \"people\" whom she had seen emerge from the huge craft, and this despite her insistence that they never came down to the ground, and were never less than 100 feet away. I asked if she dreamed about her experience after it happen- ed. \"Yes, I had dreams about it, many, many times. And I'm not the kind of person who dreams very much.\" I asked what the dreams were like. \"More or less being chased.. .by these things, whatever they were. Sometimes they were on the ground, and some- times flying. It puzzled me, and up- set me.\" To summarize this case, Ellen's ac- count strongly implies a classic abduc- tion scenario: 1. She is outside, playing, and sees a flash of light. 2. A UFO hovers nearby, and a group of small figures emerge from it. 3. She feels \"rooted to the spot.\" 4. The figures get back into the craft and it departs; she is scolded for being late, and cannot account for her time. 5. She dreams of being chased by the figures and develops a fear of being left alone, of never being safe. 6. She also develops an intense fear of becoming involved in a \"medi- cal\" situation, along with a dread of having been somehow contaminated by these creatures. 7. Through it all she tells no one, not even her mother, because, \"It was like a secret that I should keep. . . something I couldn't reveal at that time.\" The most interesting aspect of this classic apparent abduction is its date: It occurred, most probably, in 7929, 52 years ago. Ellen Sutler was born in 1918. She is a retired school teacher and an assistant principal with a distinguished career in education. She is happily married, and has a son who is on a university faculty. She has very little acquaintance with the UFO literature, and so was simultaneously relieved and shocked to hear that her experi- ence is neither unique nor uncommon. She also has no idea that I suspect she was captured by those strange 'people' and examined aboard their craft nearly 52 years ago. Though she is in many ways an open person, unopposed to experi- ment and exploration, when I sug- gested that hypnosis might aid her re- collection of an experience that hap- pened so many years before, she quickly demurred. She has a special fear about the process. Also, she is currently in poor health, and is un- willing to make any unnecessary trips away from her home. I delayed writing this report in the hope, now vanished, that she would one day consent to undergo regressive hypnosis, and so I present it now, 14 months after the interviews were completed. I have visited Ellen and her hus- band, a retired business man, in their comfortable suburban home near Spring Valley. Fifty-two years ago the site of the original encounter, near their present home,.was rural and quite isolated. I have absolute confidence in the veracity of both Mr. and Mrs. Sutler, and respect for the clarily of Ellen's recall. Her language can be unusually eloquenl, as she describes an experience lhal I, for one, had thought of as a phe- nomemon of the post-1947 years: \"There wasn't another soul. Not another noise. The birds stopped. Everything slopped. Il was like time stood still. Almost as if you were in the present and yet you weren't. I can't describe il. It was like the fields (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"THE CREDIBILITY OF UFO HYPOTHESES By Stuart Campbell The many hypotheses which have been proposed as explanations for the UFO phenomenon vary greatly in scope, credibility, and the number and type of underlying assumptions. Some lists of alternative hypotheses have been produced, such as that of BUFORA 1 (see Figure 1). It is evi- dent that some hypotheses, such as the first, are quite credible, but that others, such as the fifth, are very dif- ficult to believe. That assumptions do lie behind the hypotheses is evident from the use of undefined terms such as \"expert,\" \"mental projection,\" and \"beyond our space-time continuum.\" In fact the reader can only guess what these terms mean to those who framed the hypotheses. Another list of hypotheses is given by GreenwelP. Here an attempt at classification has been made; the hy- potheses are divided into two cate- gories. The \"conventional\" category includes all those hypotheses which propose that UFOs are misidentifica- tion of known objects or phenomena, or hoaxes, or hallucinations. The \"un- conventional\" category is said to con- sist of eight major hypotheses, as fol- lows: 1. Secret Weapon Theory 2. Hollow Earth Theory 3. Underwater Civilization Theory 4. Space Animal Theory 5. Extraterrestrial Hypothesis (ETH) 6. Time Travel Theory 7. Ultraterrestrial Theory 8. Psychic Projection Theory (Abduction, Continued) were there, the tree was there, the house was there, I was there, and yet. . .1 felt like. . .my mother was in the house, but she wasn't in the same world I was in. . .\" Q It is clear that Greenwell's \"conven- tional\" theories are more credible than his \"unconventional\" ones. A \"credible\" theory is surely one which does not require the assumption of very many unconventional ideas. All hypotheses make assumptions, and it is axiomatic in science that as- sumptions should not be multiplied more than necessary to explain the evidence (Occam's Razor). By \"as- sumption\" I mean the taking for granted of statements which are un- supported by any evidence. Among assumptions there are degrees; some seem more likely to be true than others. Thus those hypotheses are to be preferred which make the least number and most credible assump- tions, and UFO hypotheses may be ranked in order of credibility accord- ing to the number of assumptions in- volved and the reasonableness of those assumptions. One means of examining the avail- able hypotheses is to consider them, in order of increasing number of as- sumptions, as applied to a hypotheti- cal UFO report. Figure 2 illustrates the interrogative procedure that should be applied, and the relative credibility of various explanations. A series of yes/no questions is asked, and analysis proceeds via one of two alternative routes. The horizontal levels represent increasing degrees of assumption downwards, hypotheses of equal credibility appearing on the same level. We make no assumptions con- cerning the UFO report; it exists! Thus the first question must be: \"Is the report true?\" Thus explanations which involve hallucination or fraud are seen to be high credibility theories; indeed the public and media are dis- posed to believe that UFO reporters are either mentally ill or liars. But where it is assumed that there was no objective stimulus for the report, it is still necessary to show cause for hallucination or motive for fraud. In the absence of any evidence that the witness was prone to perception with- out objective stimulus, or that fraud was perpetrated, it is necessary to as- sume that the report is true. Advance to the next level (2) in- volves the reasonable assumption that there was an objective stimulus, and faces the question: \"Was the object natural?\" Either the stimulus was a natural object or phenomenon, or it was an artifice, and we should remem- ber Shklovsky's Dictum that \"every object must be assumed natural until proved unnatural\"^. Natural causes are either extraterrestial, such as Venus or meteors, or terrestrial, such as birds or various meteorological phenomena. Artificial causes of high credibility include balloons, air and space vehicles, and satellites. Level 3 shows that \"conventional\" hypotheses enjoy roughly equal rank and credibil- ity. Among the man-made artifices there may be a special class of secret military craft or weapons unknown to the public, and of course also un- known to ufologists. Thus the Secret Weapon Theory must rate as more credible than the other \"unconven- tional\" hypotheses, but, as Greenwell has demonstrated, it does not appear to be very reasonable. If the U. S. government had UFO type craft it would hardly spend so much money on conventional rocket development, nor would it permit the new craft to be flown so blatantly in public, both in the U. S. and in other countries. Further, details of such craft could hardly have been kept secret for so long.4 It may also be asked why, if the U. S. government was responsible for UFOs, it established both internal and external enquiries to explain them. Clearly the Secret Weapon"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Theory requires us to assume that the U. S. government (to say nothing of any other government) is insane, and controls the press, in this matter but in no other, to an extent only otherwise seen under totalitarian re- gimes. Not only do these assumptions make the theory less credible, they are completely unjustified. Other \"unknown\" explanations may lie in level 3, as BUFORA's fourth hypothesis aptly suggests. There may well be unidentified na- tural objects or phenomena, either in space or in Earth's atmosphere, which could account for UFO reports. If they exist, the fact that they are unidentified means that their charac- teristics are unknown. Thus it is not possible to determine whether or not such objects or phenomena can ex- plain all UFO reports which are not explicable by other means. Remem- bering Shklovsky's Dictum, and the fact that this hypothesis rests only on the assumption that such phenomena exist, the theory should have a high credibility rating. Now of course there is another class of artificial objects that could, if they exist, explain UFO reports. If a UFO is an artifice, but not one made by mankind, then it must have been made by some other (alien) intelli- gence. Although this appears to be a straight alternative explanation, it is nothing of the sort. The chart makes it clear that this alternative makes more assumptions; in fact it makes so many assumptions that it must be given a very low credibility rating. (The chart should really show a great gulf between levels 3 and 4, to repre- sent the huge number of assumptions that are made in level 4.) The principal assumption under- lying all alien artifice hypotheses is that alien intelligence exists. But, apart from the UFO phenomenon itself, which in this case can hardly be a determining factor, there is no evidence that in the whole Universe there exists any intelligence other than the human race. Some scientists even argue that we are absolutely alone, at least in our own Galaxy. While it is known that the elements found on Earth are also present in all parts of Figure 1. - BUFORA'S UFO Hypotheses 1. That the sightings involve misidentifications of objects which are manmade or natural and are well known to experts. 2. That the sightings involve manmade devices only known to their inventors. 3. That the sighting reports are hoaxes or involve fabrications. 4. That the sightings involve natural events which are not observed often enough for scien- tists to have produced suitable scientific explanations. 5. That the sightings are mental projections by or received by the witness. 6. That the sightings involve devices produced by one or more alien advanced technologies, which originate A. elsewhere in our Universe, being (i) within our Solar System (ii) within our Galaxy (iii) beyond our Galaxy B. in a Universe which is not obvious to us yet using conventional techniques and which is (i) parallel to ours in space and time (ii) parallel to ours in space but contemporaneous (iii) parallel to ours in time but not space 7. That the sightings are of intelligent processes beyond our space-time continuum and not explicable in any of the categories listed above. the Galaxy, and while it is believed that most stars possess planetary sys- tems, it does not follow that intelli- gent life is plentiful. Many life forms may exist, but, as Christian observes, an \"extremely rare combination of events\" may be necessary to produce intelligent beings.-* Simpson has con- cluded that it is \"extremely unlikely that anything enough like us for real communication of thought exists any- where in our accessible universe.\"\" The more we discover of the origin of life on Earth, the more re- markable the human race appears. It is certain that without the Moon, there would be. no tides upon Earth, and without tides marine life might have found it impossible to make the transition to the land. Recently, it has been proposed, not without evi- dence, that a giant meteorite caused the extinction of the dinosaurs and nearly all life on Earth 65 million years ago. Without this accidental change, which permitted the mammals to flourish, dinosaurs might still rule the Earth! And what accidents caused a group of primitive apes to adopt up- right gait and to communicate by sounds? Almost certainly climatic changes were responsible for the emer- gence of the new species homo sapiens. Therefore the evolution of man- kind appears to be the product of a series of environmental accidents, which, while they may occur on any planet, may not occur in just the right combination or at the right time. Who knows whether or not a similar set of accidents has produced other intelli- gent beings in the Galaxy? It would be rash to claim that we are unique, but equally rash to claim that we are not unique. Thus the concept of alien intelligence is based upon one colos- sal assumption, and all hypotheses, which rely on the concept have their credibility reduced accordingly. Do Aliens Exist? Another argument for the unique- ness of mankind is that if other in- telligence exists, it would by now have found us. UFOs apart, we have not yet been visited by alien explorers. Some argue that mankind could ex- plore and settle the entire Galaxy in the next million years, and ask why another intelligence more advanced than us has not already done so. It may be concluded that they have not done so because they do not exist! Once it is assumed that aliens exist, more assumptions have to be (Continued.on next page)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"(Hypotheses, Continued) made before a viable explanation for UFOs emerges. Estimates of the num- ber of advanced technological civiliza- tions (ATCs) in the Galaxy vary great- ly, but all put the nearest one at a very considerable distance from us. This distance may be anything be- tween a few hundred light years, and several thousand. Such huge distances may mean that physical transport be- tween ATCs will always remain im- possible. Marx observes that inter- stellar flight would demand antimat- ter as fuel and that a 100 light-year return trip would require many mil- lions of tons of this fuel^. As Asimov observes, it is unlikely that aliens would expend this amount of energy, to say nothing of the time involved, merely, \"to play games with us over a period of decades\" . In similar vein, Berry has observed that it is difficult to see why a species should send an expedition tens of trillions of miles through space, with no other purpose than to alarm airline pilots^. To overcome these objections, it is necessary to assume that superior aliens have found some way to cross interstellar space without consuming so much energy, or so much time. Perhaps they can travel faster than light, or through some (hypothetical) \"holes\" in the spacetime continuum. However, these drastic assumptions greatly reduce the credibility of the ETH. But the ETH demands even more assumptions. If UFOs are alien space- craft, we must assume that Earth is under almost constant surveillance. On the assumption that there is noth- ing special about Earth and that simi- lar surveillance takes place on one billion planets, and, further, making the modest assumption that only one Earthly UFO per year represents a genuine alien visitation, Sagan has calculated that each of an assumed one million ATCs would need to launch ten thousand spacecraft per year (i.e. about one launch per hour)! Hong-Yee Chiu has calculated that the total mass of metal needed to build all these spacecraft during the history of the Galaxy, assuming that each craft is no bigger than an Apollo capsule, is equivalent to the mass of half-a-million stars!'0 Of course it may be that only a few, or even only one, ATCs are re- sponsible for the craft, and that UFO reports are generated by repeated sighting of the same craft at different times in different places. But the odds are very much against a few ATCs oc- curring close together in a Galaxy otherwise devoid of them. And it is questionable whether this is a more reasonable hypothesis than the idea that we are being visited by many ATCs. It would imply that at least one nearby ATC has found us sufficiently interesting to justify surveillance, but not interesting enough to justify overt contact. It would also imply that the ATC concerned has been visiting us over a period of at least a thousand years, without any change in its tac- tics, or indeed any change in the de- sign of its craft. This does not seem reasonable. Sagan has pointed out the basic flaw in the argument that something on Earth is of extreme fascination to aliens. If there are very many ATCs, so making visitation more probable, then Earth must be far from unique and interesting. On the other hand, if there are very few ATCs, which would make us more interest- ing, then visitation is much less prob- ablell. If UFOs are alien spacecraft, it would be necessary to impute to the occupants what seems to us as irra- tional behavior. When (or if) man- kind reaches an alien planet, it is most unlikely that we will sneak about in the dead of night, frightening lonely aliens and conducting obscure experi- ments. Beings who are intelligent enough to build interstellar spacecraft are intelligent enough to make contact in the proper manner. It is special pleading to argue that aliens, especially very advanced aliens, may not behave in the same way as us. The thought processes of all intelligent creatures are most likely to follow a similar pattern, and there is no reason to suppose that aliens think in a way different from us. Any beings capable of crossing the vastness of space, or spacetime, will have a highly developed intellect and culture. By all our standards they would, if nothing else, be rational. Having reached us they would cer- tainly make contact openly,especially when they know, as they must, that we believe in the existence of aliens and are prepared for their arrival. In the developed countries there would be no question of severe cultural shock, although there would certainly be mild tremors. In all, the number and radical nature of the assumptions necessary to make the ETH a feasible explana- tion for UFOs make it a most unlikely explanation. Time Travel An alternative hypothesis suggests that time travel is involved; that the UFOnauts are either our descendants or aliens from the future. Here is another colossal assumption, that time travel is possible. Robinson has pointed out that time travel, at least backward travel, is a perfect type of a contradictory and impossible con- cept. It is not possible to accept the notion that travel into the past could so alter the present that something which existed when you left was not there when you returned. Nor does he accept that time travellers who watch but do not touch the past are really time travellers. They, he says, are just backward-looking clairvoyants. The acid test of time travel should be the ability to do things in or to the past. Not that travel into the future is any less paradoxical. Unless the travel is permanent and irreversible, the traveller who, after he has seen the future, returns to his present so as to work to avoid the future which he has seen, turns his time machine into a cheat! For how could his machine have shown him a future which he is now working to avoid? ^ Despite the philosophical objec- tions to time travel, Tipler has sug- gested that a time machine could be constructed based on the principles of general relativity. But the machine would need to be built in space, and would consist of a massive cylinder with a radius of 10 km and a length of 100 km. It would need to have a density similar to that of a neutron 8"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Figure 2. — UFO hypotheses related to each other and degrees of assumption FALSE hoax hallucination TRUE (objective stimulus) MAN-MADE OBJECT air/space craft balloon NATURAL OBJECT OR PHENOMENON IN SPACE sun/moon, star/planet, aurorae.

Even then Tipler suggests that it could only be used for sending mes- sages into the past, and not beyond the time of the construction of the machine^. It seems very unlikely that such a machine would ever be built, and impossible to see how it could explain UFOs. Travel into the future at a rate faster than our usual rate is one pre- diction of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity. As speeds approach that of light, then time slows. In ef- fect, travellers in very high speed vehicles will travel more rapidly into the future than those who remain behind. Apparently, travel into the very intense gravitational field of a black hole causes the same relativistic effect. The traveller sees time in the rest of the universe speeded up, such that when he emerges from the field he is well into his own future. Gribben calls this type of travel \"time travel of the first kind\" ; J 4 Some believe that rotating black holes, like Tipler's rotating cylinder, offer the theoretical possibility of penetrating to other areas of space- time. This may mean that they could be used to explore the past, or for what Gribben calls \"time travel of the second kind.\" But chance alone would determine where you went and \"when\" you went, and it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to get home again. If UFOs are occupied by travellers who have used a rotating black hole to come back in time to explore our planet, then they came to our spacetime by chance and do not know how to get back to their own spacetime. Under such circumstances one would imagine that they would make open contact with us. Such an explanation for UFOs not only assumes that the objects are spacetime craft occupied by aliens, or humans from the future, but that the craft can travel through space to reach Earth from the nearest black hole, perhaps Cygnus X-l 6000 light- years away! Clearly the time travel hypothesis holds more assumptions than the relatively simple ETH. Nor is the number of assumptions reduced by adopting hypotheses which (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"(Hypotheses, Continued) claim that UFOs come from inside the Earth, under the seas, other dimen- sions, or parallel universes. The Psy- chic Projection Theory involves the grave assumption that mankind's col- lective unconscious can physically project material forms! The most credible of these alien or \"unconven- tional\" hypotheses, the ETH, involves so many assumptions that it must be regarded as very unlikely to offer the correct solution to the UFO problem, while the credibility of the other \"un- conventional\" hypotheses must be practically zero. Faced with such a large credibility gap between the \"conventional\" and \"unconventional\" hypotheses, it must be obvious that we should look for explanations in level 3 of the chart. We should turn to explanations in- volving large numbers of assumptions only when and if explanations in- volving few assumptions cannot ex- plain the evidence. Some may con- sider that the evidence is inexplicable in \"conventional\" terms, but that depends upon what is meant by \"con- ventional.\" If there are as yet uniden- tified natural phenomena in the at- mosphere, it may be that their char- acteristics can indeed explain the UFO enigma. At least this possibility should be considered before turning to hy- potheses which require many more assumptions. Another criterion for hypotheses is whether or not they are scientific. Popper defines a \"scientific hypoth- esis\" as one which is falsifiable; hy- potheses cannot be proved true, but they can be proved false, and only those that are capable of being dis- proved are truly scientific. A scientific theory must produce predictions that are testable, and theories which pro- duce no predictions are unscientific^. Thus claims that UFOs are due to a certain cause are unscientific unless it is possible for someone to prove that they are not due to that cause. Which UFO hypotheses are capa- ble of being falsified? It is evident that most of the \"conventional\" hypoth- eses could be proved false. For in- stance, the postulation that a particu- lar UFO was an artificial Earth satellite could be falsified if it were shown that no satellite was in the appropriate position at the appropriate time. All the hypotheses in level 3 should be capable of producing testable predic- tions, although hypotheses which state that UFOs are a rare natural phenomenon may be difficult to falsify where little is known of the phenomenon. Among the \"alien\" hypotheses of level 4, some may be scientific. For instance, the theory that UFOs origi- nate from or are based on the Moon is capable of falsification, given com- prehensive exploration of the satellite. Indeed, any theory which nominates the source of UFOs can be regarded as scientific insofar as exploration of that source can be expected in due course. But hypotheses which nomi- nate sources which are presently be- yond our reach and investigation are less credible than those which nomi- easily accessible sources. The Hollow Earth Theory is scientific, not only because it makes a testable prediction, but because the alleged' source is so easily accessible. Furthermore this theory has already been proved false. 16 What then of the ETH? This hy- pothesis can only be falsified if we are told the exact location of the alien planet and have the means to explore it. It would also need to be demon- strable that UFOs are spacecraft originating from and guided by in- telligent beings from that planet. Only if all this could be proved true could it be proved false. At present we do not have the means to locate, let alone explore any extrasolar planets, and the ETH must remain unscientific. And how do you falsify the hy- pothesis that UFOs are time machines from the future, or capsules from another dimension or universe? With- out the means to falsify such concepts we cannot regard them as scientific. REFERENCES 1. British UFO Research Association: UFO Investigation (A Field Investi- gator's Handbook) Rev. ed.

Could standard photo- grammetric processes be applied in studying them? Not fully realizing the difficulty Rev. Bailey's 12 photos presented, I chose a usual course of action first, contacting two of our finest sources in the Los Angeles area. One is a space research facility equipped with com- puter enhancement instrumentation: scientists at this facility have assisted UFO researchers in the past in analyz- ing potentially valuable UFO photos. Our contact at this facility, how- ever, would not accept Bailey's Pola- roid prints for study. During an ex- tended conversation with this gentle- man, Rev. Bailey and I were told that the two shots which showed the shad- owed humanoid shapes in the door- way, as well as the dimmer photo which depicted what Bailey described as the two (disembodied) heads against the window shade, were \"acceptable\" for scientific study. These three photos showed sufficient \"physical\" forms, including suggestions of facial features and definite humanoid bodies with light reflecting off a dispropor- tionately large, and apparently bald, cranium. The two photos showing the formations of lights were also accept- able for analysis. However, the \"full light\" photos with their dangling appendages and black, staring eyes were a roadblock to this scientist. Bailey's denial that he owned a flash unit for the camera was greeted with extreme skepticism. He indicated, albeit tactfully, that the full light photos cast doubt on the authen- ticity of the entire incident. The other photogrammetric source in Los Angeles has also con- tributed richly to the UFO photo re- search field. This gentleman, when consulted regarding Bailey's photos, stated that his intuitive impression was that the photos might be authen- tic; however, he did not know how to go about properly analyzing them, since his expertise is in analyzing UFO photos showing physical craft. He said he thought the brilliant light streaks and shadowed shapes in the \"dark\" photos were replicable with proper equipment such as strong light sources and special reflective materials, etc. However, he had neither the time nor the inclination to devote to study- ing them. He suggested that in view of their apparent paranormal aspects, that I should find a source which would investigate them from a para- psychological angle. I consulted with psychic re- searchers Raymond Bayless, D. Scott Rogo, Barry Taff, and Kerry Gaynor. Nowhere in the Southland area were there any psychic research facilities which could adequately examine Bailey's photos. Taff and Gaynor took more than a passing interest in them and were instrumental in secur- ing an enlarged reproduction which depicted the flight of the second en- tity through Bailey's bathroom door- way. Though not computer-enhanced, the resulting color slide showed de- tails of the humanoid body which were not readily apparent on the orig- inal Polaroid print. (This picture was presented in Part I, this column.) Even among the parapsychologists there was skepticism over Rev. Bailey's statement that he did not own, or use, a flash in connection with the full-light pictures. It was suggested by some of the parapsychologists that the witness did not \"remember\" taking these pic- tures with a flash. In view of the fact that Bailey had told me during the initial interview that his memories of that nighrwere incomplete, and that he had recalled the events of that night only in snatches since October 31 - November 1, 1978, this explanation seemed possible, but Bailey continued to state he did noKown a flash unit. I sent complete reports, compar- ison photos and copies of some of Bailey's clearer pictures to MUFON headquarters and to the Center for UFO Studies. MUFON felt there were nothing that scientists could do to analyze them. They were considered too paradoxical and, therefore, ques- tionable. The Editor of the MUFON UFO Journal, Richard Hall, also ini- tially took this view. Dr. J. Allen Hynek, on behalf of CUFOS, consulted Dr. Jules Eisenbud about the photos, who was not at all impressed. He told Dr. Hynek that \"he has dozens like it, but that they all fell into the class of 'interesting but so what.' They were all too fuzzy and too ambiguous to attempt a real scientific evaluation.\" Dr. Hynek agreed with Dr. Eisenbud's opinion. He could not offer any suggestions, although he considered them interest- ing, and in view of the fact that I vouched for Rev. Bailey's character, he conceded the possibility that they were \"genuine\" but was still at a loss as to how to proceed. 1 I, too, was unsure how to pro- ceed; therefore I proceeded onward. After months of work I finally located a source in San Diego who took copies of several of the photos''to analyze. This source has computer enhance^ ment facilities, but work on the pic- tures, being on a voluntary and unpaid basis, is slow and no real results have (Continued on next page) 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"(Entity Photos, Continued) been forthcoming. It was refreshing, however, after many rejections, to finally find scientists who were at least willing to accept the possibility that the photos were genuine, though paranormal. For by this time it was quite plain to all concerned that, if the photos are, as stated by Bailey, a record of visitation by (UFO) en- tities, then the photos, and the visita- tion, must have definite paranormal aspects. The entities, if they truly existed, could not have been \"phys- ical\" as we understand the term. The Problem The problem of the photos re- volved around this question: could we accept Bailey's statements that the photos were a true record of what had happened to him? Although the dark and shadowed photos were \"accept- able,\" the full-light pictures exuded difficult parapsychological implica- tions or, worse still, suggested a crude hoax. But why should Bailey mix ac- ceptable photos.with patently ridicu- lous ones? That he did present the'en- tire lot for study, in my opinion, speaks of his honesty. In spite of his own confusion and fear, he did not withold any information he had about the experience. Taken as a whole, his statements, backed up by the photos, seemed to represent an accurate record of the chronology of events. At. the suggestion of D. Scott Rogo, I asked the Bureau for the In- vestigation of Paranormal Photographs to analyze the photos. This London- based organization promptly returned a technical report through the kind- ness of its director, Mr. Cyril Permutt. The report is too lengthy for full in- clusion in this column,2 but in general the Bureau could find no trace of any extraneous marking effects or altera- tions of the images. Permutt was of the opinion that the \"black\" or dark photos could be likened to certain \"black\" Polaroid pictures produced by Ted Series. 3 By this time, much interest in Bailey's photos had been expressed by a group of UFO researchers who meet regularly, but unofficially, on the campus of a major Los Angeles university. This ten-member group accepted the difficult situation the pictures presented. We set about trying to make sense of them. By \"sense\" we meant to find out through tech- nical means whether the pictures were hoaxed or genuine. All we sought was the truth. Slides were made of Bailey's orig- inal Polaroid pictures by Martin Studios in Pasadena. A talented tech- nician at this photographic studio produced such careful duplications of the images on these prints that the \"dark\" photos looked almost en- hanced. The features of the entities on the first slide could be viewed rather clearly and compared to the two masks. The features were not the same. The entire series of slides were projected on a screen and studied by our research group in a brainstorming session. We could not find any gross evidence that the pictures had;been hoaxed. The humanoid shape(s) in the two pictures depicting the entities' flight through the doorway were rem- iniscent of human, but were more sug- gestive of an embryonic form than a fully developed one. We could not readily identify the material of which the appendages in the full-light photos were formed — they were not readily apparent as nurses' stockings filled with cotton batting, or child's pajamas for instance. The legs had a peculiar, flexible, fibrous quality. The group re- commended that these appendages be compared to pictures of ectoplasmic manifestations. Strangest of all, on two of the photos, Bailey's bathroom door frame appeared to be double-exposed. The Polaroid One-Step camera used by Bailey was supposed to be impossible to double-expose. With the help of Raymond Bay- less and his splendid psychic research library, ectoplasmic manifestations captured on film in the early 1900s by European researchers gave us suf- ficiently dense photographic images to compare with Bailey's full light photos. Slides were made of four such photos from the book PHENOMENA OF MATERIALIZATION, by Baron von Schrenck-Notzing.4 Compared with the \"appendages,\" and allowing for the diminished, lithographic quali- ty of the ectoplasmic pictures, they seemed to have similar texture and flexibility. The situation remained thus for several more months. Other than waiting for the source in San Diego to report, there seemed nothing more that could be done to analyze these exceptional photos. I kept remember- ing something Bailey had described, however, very shortly after he first showed me the photos in January 1979. From his incomplete recall of the events of the night of October 31 - November 1, 1978, he had snatched a memory of an \"object\" he had seen in the corner of his bathroom. He had viewed this strange thing for a second or two after he attempted to follow the first entity as it flung itself off the table and sprang through the doorway. Although the creature was no longer visible when Bailey looked into the bath, the \"object\" seemed to be spin- ning strings of \"stuff like spider webs\" which collected into a stump of ma- terial several inches long. It disap- peared quickly \"into the wall\" as Bailey entered the room. The witness' attention was then quickly drawn to the balls of light which he stated were also in the bathroom, and he assumed that the creature (and the subsequent second entity) had disappeared into, or turned into, one or more balls of light which he saw spinning around in the room. I began to wonder if, at all possi- bly, the \"object\" resembling clumped spider webs could have had anything to do with the ectoplasmic-like mani- festation of the appendages shown in the full-light photos. In October 1980 a fortuitous event occurred. A microphotographic technician with 25 years experience in the photographic field offered his ser- vices for photo analysis in the Los Angeles area. Timothy King,^ having an intense interest in UFO research, generously gave of his time and talents in trying to help make sense of the Bailey pictures. Together with Dr. William Hassel, the State Section Di- rector for Los Angeles County, and 12"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Charles Druffel and myself, King studied the set ! of slides. During a two-hour session, the following para- doxical aspects of the photos were noted: 1. In the first photo which shows the \"disembodied heads\" against the window shade, the image of the door- way is double exposed. There was no answer as to how that part of the pic- ture could appear double exposed, since the edge of the window shade and the heads themselves were not double images. One head appeared to be looking off to the right, the other to the left, and the features on the two faces were not identical. 2. In view of the sharpness of the angles on the double-exposed doorway and the absence of \"streaks\" between the double images, King con- cluded it was not a normal double exposure. He called this picture paradoxical, a \"puzzle.\" The heads themselves were apparently three- dimensional with proper shadows within the features themselves and also a deep shadow between the two heads. They were illuminated by a strong light source streaming through the bathroom door, and this light source, as well as the door frame, was double exposed. The light source was not the 40 watt bulb burning in Bailey's bath; this was far too dim to register more than a faint glow on comparison photos taken with the same camera. Bailey had mentioned seeing a mo- mentary, strong \"red\" light shooting out the doorway about the time he photographed the heads. 3. In the full-light photos, all images within them - the shadows of the table legs, a reflection off a Vicks' cough drop box on the table, the lu- minosity of Bailey's net curtains lying on a nearby bookcase, and the total absence of orange, incandescent tinge — all bespoke \"flash.\" In King's opin- ion, the full light photos were taken with a flash, most likely a small unit, such as a hand camera would normally employ. By this time, Bailey had pur- chased the necessary equipment to take flash pictures. He had consulted the photography department at the Broadway where he purchased the camera in the summer of 1978. They had explained to him that the flash unit was built into the camera and that the simple use of a Sylvania blue-dot flash bar atop the camera would give him the ability to take flash pictures. Since King's opinion was that the full-light pictures were taken with a flash unit employing strobe light, I asked Rev. Bailey again about the conditions under which the full light photos had been taken. He maintained that, to the best of his remembrance, he had not known about the built-in flash unit or the necessity of using flash bars to activate the flash. When I suggested that he might have \"for- gotten\" this particular detail, either in the excitement of the moment or due to the fact that the memories of the night in question were still hazy and confused, he stated that this was possible but that he had no memory of it. He could not remember whether a flash bar was included in the box at the time he purchased the camera. The question of the light source of the full- light photos remains unanswered. 4. The texture of the \"append- ages\" was also studied with King and Hassel. We could not think of any common material which could enfold into the fibrous, flexible shapes dis- played by the \"legs.\" The material still seemed suggestive of dense ectoplasm, and indeed, in later viewing of these photos through a microviewer, the fibrous, compacted quality of this material could be plainly seen. We were also confronted by another strange feature in the humanoid- shaped form. This slide, an enlarge- ment of the entity, revealed that part of the creature's body, particularly the left arm and an umbilicus-like cord projecting from the area of its abdomen, seemed to be shredding away. The shredded part seemed to be going ahead of, or projecting ahead of, the creature in its flight through the doorway. 5. A totally unexpected surprise remained to be discovered by Timothy King toward the end of this two-hour study session. Bailey, after photo- graphing eleven aspects of the crea- tures' alleged visit, had seen creatures and lights disappear from view, leav- ing an apparent normal bathroom. However, he took another picture, hoping that perhaps some other mo- mentary manifestation would appear. This twelfth photo showed nothing' but the west and south walls of the green, glossy bath, with small dia- mond-shaped window frames high on' the south wall. Below these was a mirror about 20 inches by 36 inches, set in a heavy wooden frame. On the' small table where this mirror was perched was a pile of newspapers. This was all that showed in the pic-\" ture, at least to the normal eyesight. King, whose eyes were attuned to seeing detail in photo grain which could escape normal scrutiny, noticed that a fuzzy pink feature in the photo, which we had first taken for part of the mirror, had a curious double- image effect. Using a Fresnel reduc- tion lens, he focused the light rays from this part of the picture onto the screen. To our surprise, two humanoid forms, complete with heads, facial features, shoulders and torso, were plainly visible within this pinkish mass. King opined that these, images represented one entity being reflected in the mirror! If I had not seen this curious phenomenon with, my own eyes, I would not have be- lieved it. Later, showing this to Bailey, we found that the double forms are also readily visible when the photo is examined in strong sunlight. It is hoped that in the future this particular slide can be computer enhanced so these humanoid shapes can be more clearly visible. The above account of extraordi- nary means taken to analyze extra- ordinary photos is necessarily con- densed and incomplete.

Cerny (MUFON Western Regional Director) A small discoid type craft was discovered in the middle of a carrot patch a few miles south of Salinas, California, in the summer of 1947. Time was 9:00 a.m. and month was either July or August of that year. The object had apparently come down in the night as it was discovered just sitting there in the morning, by the vegetable ranch foreman. The object was approximately 9 feet in diameter and 4 feet high. It appeared to be made out of a dull metal resembling aluminum. The shape was double dis- coid, that is like two soup bowls edge to edge. There was a series of elon- gated or rectangular ports complete- ly surrounding the edge or rim area. Nothing could be observed through these. There were no markings, insig- nia, numbers or any other I.D. on the craft. It seemed undamaged and un- occupied. No visible means of propul- sion could be seen. The interviewed witness, who was 19 years of age at the time, was cut- ting hay in an adjacent field along with a fellow worker of approximate- ly the same age. At the time they were unaware of its presence until the ranch foreman came by and told them. Their curiosity urged them to go and look at it. The witness, who is now a local respected businessman in the Bay Area, does not wish his name used in connection with this incident.

Since it was so long ago and he was so young at the time, he does not recall the names of his working partner, the foreman, or the ranch owners, as the ranch could have changed hands several times in that span of time. Keeping their distance, within reason, they cautiously walked around the object. The witness then stated he got up nerve enough to run up and kick it, for any possible reaction. None was forthcoming. About that time an Air Force truck approached with a long flatbed attached, along with a contingent of military personnel. They instructed the two young men to \"get lost\" and warned them not to breathe a word about what they had seen-. From a distance the witness and his compan- ion observed the military group pro- ceed to struggle the vehicle onto the truck bed, cover it with a tarp, secure it, and drive off. That was the last they saw or heard of it. Inquiring of the foreman later, they learned that the ranch owners had informed the military authorities of the object's presence. Sisters Watch Object Over Des Moines By Mildred Biesele Two sisters driving home from a movie in Des Moines, Iowa, last winter (1979) watched a diamond shaped UFO move slowly over the city. The case was investigated for MUFON by Dr. Desmond H. Bragg, former State Section Director for Polk County, and Forrest Lundberg, State Director for Iowa. The night of December 20 was cold and clear when Darla Goodrich, 18, and her sister Tysa, 24, left a movie house about 9:30 and headed east on the freeway toward home. Darla was driving. As the car came out from an underpass, Tysa exclaim- ed, \"Look at that! That's not a plane!\" Darla looked up and saw a huge diamond-shaped object, much larger than a plane, low in the sky about two blocks away. Darla pulled the car off the free- way and the girls jumped out to watch as the object moved toward them. Fly- ing over, they said, it looked like the bottom of a square dishpan, slightly convex, with bright white lights at the four corners. It made a low rumbling sound, deeper than the noise of a plane. After the craft disappeared behind the trees, the girls climbed back into the car and started to follow it. They could catch occasional glimpses of it through the trees and knew when they were close to it by the sound. Soon they gave up the pursuit and started home, but they spotted (Continued on next page) 14"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MOVIE REVIEW Hope springs eternal. But as I sat in the movie theater, moaning softly and covering my eyes from time to time and thinking of a man named Stringfield, I knew that if \"Hanger 18\" is not the worst UFO film to date, it is running neck and neck for the gold cup. Where to begin to convey its rich implausibility? Consider, for example, the motive for concealing the exis- tence of a crashed UFO, blaming two astronauts for the \"accident\" at the space shuttle that caused the death of a third, and destroying assorted evi- dence. Well, the President must win the election that is coming up in two weeks, and some pretty grim types in the White House are determined to hush everything up until then. Their methods? Spectacular. Car chases, pursuits and dodgings among huge oil tanks and pipes, two federal agents, roaring after the astronauts who are trying to clear themselves, burned to a crisp in their car, two other federal agents ditto, another dead astronaut, the desperate survivor at the gates of the hanger - it's enough to make every script writer in Hollywood turn green with envy. At the White House, disclosure looms. But no! - those grim types don't thwart easily. See the unmanned plane, loaded with incendiaries, launched from a truck marked CIA programmed to home in on Hanger 18, as it speeds sinisterly through the night! Unmindful of their doom, the medical team, linguists, and so forth assembled and incommunicado in Hanger 18 have been performing prodigies. For a start, they successfully whisked the crashed UFO from Arizona to Texas in a mere matter of hours. Gingerly they enter it, warily they explore it, awestruck they gaze at its gadgetry (at least I think those wooden faces are trying to look awestruck). But they are not bewil- dered long. The linguist announces that the cryptic symbols in the UFO library are the same as those on a mysterious pyramid in the Central American jungles, and in a couple of days of earnest study he has decoded the language. Then what revelations! It turns out that the aliens have been dropping in on Earth for thousands of years, mating with our primitive forebears, making pictures and taping descriptions of it all. They are our ancestors, in fact. In case you've wondered. As for the two alien occupants, asphyxiated by the crash, don't worry. They are as like us as makes no real difference — bones, blood, etc., etc. The male, D.O.A., stretched out on the slab, has a large hairless head but otherwise looks ruddy and. robust. The female lives only long enough to give us a glimpse of her beautifully waved blonde hair as she tosses her head and dies screaming. What a pity she wasn't saved. She could have sup- plied the romantic interest that is the only Hollywood ingredient missing from the film. She could have fallen in love with the third astronaut, but his human girl friend is jealous and - but I must not live in a world of fantasy. But the two weeks are slipping by, and here comes that plane loaded with fiery death. Are all these dis- coveries to be wiped out, along with the astronaut, the director of NASA, and the scientists? If you think so, you underestimate Sunn Classics. The plane hits. Conflagration. Where is everybody? Why, inside the UFO.

They noticed that a motorist had stopped his car on the ramp and was hugging the steering wheel, staring at the object. After they had been in the house a few minutes, they heard the now familiar rumble and rushed out to see the UFO moving away behind the trees. Darla was waiting for a phone call, so Tysa took the car and tried to follow the object alone. She drove a few blocks in the direction they had seen it moving and was able to spot it again, close to the ground. It rose and moved slowly on. The last she saw of it, it seemed to be stationed over Ber- man Woods. The total sighting time was about 45 minutes. Tysa went back home and the girls debated what to do. They called the police, the airport tower, and local television and radio stations. They said they didn't know whom to call to re- port the sighting; neither \"UFO\" or the Air Force was listed in the tele- phone directory. The police sent a squad car to the area, but the officers did not find any- thing unusual. A spokesman at the air- port tower said there was nothing in the air over Des Moines from 9:45 to 10:15 to account for the sighting. Af- ter the story appeared in the Tribune the next day, several people called the Goodrich girls and said that they, too, had seen the object over the city. Both girls are university students, normal, healthy, intelligent, with good eyesight. Their father is the Regional Minister for the Christian Churches of Iowa, Minnesota, and Nebraska. Anyone else who may have seen the UFO in or near Des Moines last December 20 is asked to get in touch with Dr. Bragg at Duke University. IS"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"2.

Letter A World UFO Organization Editor, Is it possible for a world UFO or- ganization to exist? If so, how large of a project would we need to satisfy our curiosity in the realm of UFOs? Per- haps something like the system the United Nations has now. Letting our imagination go a bit, lets see how far we can go to fulfill such a request. Computers everywhere, dissecting each case into many differ- ent factors. Finding patterns (if any) in the landing traces cases or similar- ities in the shapes of the objects. All UFO reports reviewed by a UFO Review Board. Also, all theories about UFOs reviewed by a different Review Board. Field investigators were given tests of their abilities under cer- tain circumstances. An example of this is how they would react when given an alleged scrap of a UFO. Here's an important point and probably one of the hardest to obtain. Every major and minor organization would either evolve into the world UFO Organization or at least be con- nected in some way. Will it work? No. We don't have the funds for such a large scale pro- E Mark R.

MUFON BOOK REVIEW UFO ABDUCTIONS, edited and with commentaries by D. Scott Rogo (New American Library Signet paperback, 242 p., $2 25). The continuing controversy be- tween what might be called the psy- chological and technological schools of contemporary UFO studies is no- where so sharply centered as in regard to that facet of the phenomenona known as the abduction. Are the percipients the transient biological hostages of an innately curi- ous and technologically advanced alien intelligence? Or is their frequently frightening and bewildering experience merely the byproduct of some as-yet- unidentified psychological process, an internal encounter more akin to psy- chic or religious revelation than to the actual physical confrontation of extra- terrestials? Jacques Vallee, of course, the most visible and vocal regent of the Invisible College, continues to of- fer a working compromise by keeping a foot firmly planted in each class- room. What we have here is a collection of selected abduction cases which leans heavily in the direction of a psy- chological reaction of the problem. D. Scott Rogo, the editor, is a west coast parapsychologist whose con- tributions account for almost half of the text. Ann Druffel and Jerome Clark provide another third between them; the remainder is comprised of excerpts from Bill Barry's book on the Travis Walton abduction, Gordon Creighton's oft-seen account of the Antonio Villas Boas incident, \"UFO Abduction in Brazil,\" by Coral Lo- renzen, Bill Faill's article about a UFO \"car-napping\" in Rhodesia, and a chapter from the Ralph and Judy Blum book which treats with \"the ordeal of Herbert Schirmer.\" Abductions are divided into three characterizing scenarios, \"Waking En- counters,\" \"Time-Lapse Cases,\" and \"Psychic Abductions (sic).\" Rogo con- tributes introductory notes to each section as well as substantial introduc- tion and conclusion.

The \"fault,\" of course, is not so much Rogo's. One of the most per- plexing aspects of abductions is their curious absence of corroborative wit- nesses and physical trace evidence, What Rogo does suggest is that in- vestigators take a closer look at the percipients' pyschological history, specifically at his or her mental frame preceding, during, and following the encounter, with the object of profil- ing the UFO witness and abductee. What seems to be overlooked, in general, in a survey of this sort, are the implications of possible future findings; in this instance, the very real possibility, for example, that if abduc- tions are found to be an innate psy- chological mechanism, an altogether new perspective is required, one in which abductions, instead of standing at the front of the class of inquiry, will be relegated to the back rows where they can occupy their proper seat next to the other psychological and sociological parameters of the phenomena. ' The situation then becomes anal- ogous to the psychoanalytical cliche of the paranoid, whose analyst spends more time investigating his inner, men- tal states than he does looking at the percipient's proffered evidence of a conspiracy. What psychologist bothers to look further when his patient is so obviously deluded? This is not to say that ufologists concentrate on a literal UFO conspir- acy, as in the example given, but that they do give equal consideration to the possibility that the abduction experi- ence has its origin in an external stim- ulus, which is interpreted, rather than manufactured, by the individual(s) involved. It may well be that abduc- tions in toto have nothing at all to do with the phenomena under considera- tion. It may just as well prove that they have everything to do with it. - - Dennis Stacy 18"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Lucius Parish in Other's words Jerome Clark's article in the Feb- ruary issue of FATE is one which Ufo- logisis of every persuasion will want to read.

Stringfield, titled \"Status Report On Alleged Alien Cadaver Photos,\" which provides the update that he has promised concerning his research into these controversial photos. On two occasions, your Director has published information about these photos in the July 1980 and October 1980 editions of the Journal for our readers' consumption. We identified the probable source of the photos and discussed how they could be used by the intelligence com- munity to discredit Mr. Stringfield's sensitive work in the crash/retrieval of craft and bodies. In the October 1980 edition, I alluded to the two photos that came into the possession of Williard Mclntyre, Charles J. Wil- helm, and Dennis Pilichis from a Navy photographer that allegedly displayed a burned body taken from a crashed craft found about 30 miles south of Laredo, Texas, on July 7, 1948. On January 16,1981, we received a booklet titled \"Alien Body Photos: An Updated Report\" published by the Coalition of Concerned Ufologists which is made up of MARCEN, UFOIN, and OUFOIL members, through the courtesy of Dennis Pilichis. This comprehensive report not only shows the two photos of the , burned and disfigured small body,but relates the details surrounding this purported crash taken from letters mailed to Williard Mclntyre of the Mutual Anomaly Research and Evalua- tion Network from December 11, 1978, to August 2, 1980, by the in- formant. After publishing the results of their work on the photos from the Laredo, Texas, episode the editors proceeded to devote 18 pages of their booklet to explaining the source of Leonard Stringfield's eight photos and reviewing his lecture on September 20, 1980, to the Cleveland Ufology Pro- ject meeting. The information and disclosures contained in the booklet were pub- lished in the October 1980 issue of The MUFON UFO Journal in' my Director's Message, therefore this has been common knowledge to Journal readers. If the intelligence community has purposely released these two dif- ferent sets of photos to Williard Mc- lntyre and Leonard Stringfield to dis- credit the crash/retrieval investigation, they must be delighted at the dissen- sion that, they have instigated. Objec- tive and positive research is imperative, . especially now, when the people in UFOlogy have the responsibility to \"police\" ourselves. When books such as .\"UFO. . .Contact From The Pleiades\" are thrust upon the public,'it is our responsibility to speak up and reveal the truth. This obviously applies to the photographs of the alleged bodies as well. Your Director does not condone the unwarranted attack upon Mr. Stringfield by the so-called \"coali- tion of concerned Ufologists\" as being objective research, however I do re- commend that people interested in ; the UFO crash/ retrieval phenomenon secure a copy of this publication by writing to UFO Information Network, P.
