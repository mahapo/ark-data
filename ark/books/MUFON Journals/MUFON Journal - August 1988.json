He is considered one of the world authorities concerning the effects of magnetic fields on living systems. He is also affiliated with the Center in Mining and Mineral Exploration Research in Sudbury. The tectonic strain theory states that most verified UFO phenomena (CUFOS classification IV or greater) and associated anomalous events are generated by extremely energetic but focal and brief geophysical forces. They display intense electromagnetic (as well as unknown) properties. When these forces occur, radioactive gases can be released from approp- riate rocks beneath the soil. Recent evidence strongly suggests that peo- ple who are frequently exposed to similar electromagnetic emissions and radioactive gases may suffer a higher risk of specific cancers, psychological depression and personality changes that are caused by alterations in elec- trically sensitive portions of the human brain. That most verified UFO pheno- mena share the characteristics of earthquake luminous phenomena or \"earthstress lights\" is well known. For example, as documented in Torahiko Terada's seminal work published in 1931, a \"fireball resembling a paper lantern\" was seen flying through the sky before an earthquake in Yedo (Japan) in the year 1672. Before the November 26, 1930 earthquake in the Idu district, a straight row of round masses of lights, each one revolving on its own axis, was noted above transmission lines. Earthquake-related luminous phenomena can precede MUFON UFO JOURNAL, No. 244, August 1988 By Michael A. Persinger earthquakes by days and can occur up to several hundreds of kilometers from the imminent epicenter. Recent field studies have shown that two potentially biologically hazard- ous physical stimuli are associated with some earthquakes: low level, low frequency (10 Hz or cycles per second, to 100 kHz) electromagnetic fields and radon gas emission. Radon emission from soils above faulted quartz diorite was noted by Yasui during the famous Matsushira earth- quake swarm. During this period there was copious generation of low frequency (kHz range) electromag- netic fields. Preseismic electromag- netic forces sufficient to illuminate household fluorescent lamps (switched off) and to alter the strength of magnets have been common but inconsistent observations. The tectonic strain theory predicts that similar physical stimuli should occur within the region in which fre- quent UFO reports are occurring. Although no earthquakes may be measureable near or at the time of the UFO sightings, substantial or unprece- dented increases in seismic activity (or the occurrence of an unusually powerful earthquake for the region) would be expected within the region during the following months to years. However, the geophysical forces gener- ated during the condition that creates the UFOs or Terrain Related Lights (Paul Devereaux's nomenclature) are sufficient to allow propagation of low frequency electromagnetic fields and to promote the release of radioactive gases. Although brief (a few minutes) at any given time, these forces may occur very frequently (several times per day) during flap periods within a small area but not always at intensi- ties sufficient to generate luminosities. Alleged emission of energetic elec- tromagnetic fields from luminosities and the occurrence of radioactivity near UFO phenomena that were seen on or over the ground are frequently reported. The multiple references to disruptions in electrical apparatus, such as television sets, radios and light fixtures, are also suggestive. As shown by the elegant field experi- ments of the Vestigia group in New Jersey, both low frequency electro- magnetic field emission and brief enhancements of radioactivity accom- panied by the relatively faint recur- rent luminosity known as the Hooker Light. It occurred along an old rail- road track that was adjacent to a local fault line. CANCER RISK Although the effects of ionizing radiation, such as X-rays, ultraviolet and microwave (primarily mediated by heating of tissue), upon human beings is well known, the influence of power frequency magnetic fields has only recently been considered. New epidemiological evidence suggests that people who have intermittent, but frequent exposures to low frequency magnetic fields are more prone to develop brain tumors. Electrical engi- neers, electronic technicians and radio operators are in the high risk category. There are dozen of different types of brain tumors. The most frequent involves abnormal proliferation of glial cells. One class of these cells (astro- glia), primarily responsible for the interaction between neurons and the blood vessels, is the source for the most malignant form of brain tumor: the glioblastoma. There is now evi- dence that this tumor facilitates its own growth by suppressing the per- son's immune system. Glioblastomas invade brain space quite unlike other 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"brain tumors (like meningiomas) that remain within a kind of capsule (but apply pressure) outside of the brain. Secondary sources of brain tumors originate from tumors of the lung, testis, breasts and thyroid. High risk populations that are exposed frequently to low frequency magnetic fields are more likely to develop the glioblastoma and the astrocytoma. Because they are the most frequent types of brain cancer, particularly for adults, most researchers have suggested that low frequency electromagnetic fields promote the development of the cancer. The esti- mated levels of exposure that are expected to promote these aberrant cell growths involve strengths greater than about four milligauss (60 Hz), a level that is sometimes found in ordi- nary homes near overhead powerlines. Although there is reason for con- cern, there is not necessarily a requirement for alarm. A conserva- tive estimate of the incidence of all intracranial tumors is about 20 per 100,000 people with primary malig- nant tumors (glioblastomas) in the order of 2.5 per 100,000. The odds ratios for the most sensitive epidemic- logical groups is at most about 1:3 (that is about eight per 100,000). However, these estimates are based upon vocational exposures that would be much lower than the frequent but intermittent electromagnetic fields that are postulated to occur in UFO flap areas. From an epidemiological perspec- tive, the incidence of brain tumors within sensitive populations is more effective in determining a link between the existence of the focused strain fields that accompany intense UFO phenomena and the risk of disease. Because brain tumors are frequent causes of sickness or death, their presence is conspicuous. An increased incidence of heart attacks, for exam- ple, would be more difficult to dem- onstrate since they are the most common cause of mortality. More precise quantitative studies would be required. A second type of cancer that is associated with chronic exposure to power frequency electromagnetic fields is leukemia, particularly in young children. This form of cancer has been 4 shown to become more frequent with exposure levels of more than two mil- ligauss; the exposure duration is in the order of one to a few years. Some researchers suggest that about one-third of all childhood leukemia cases may be related to electromag- netic noise. The third type of cancer appears to involve the reproductive organs. Al- though the link between reproductive problems, such as spontaneous abor- tions and miscarriages and cancer incidence has not been established, both dysfunctions have been asso- ciated with exposures to environmen- tal electromagnetic fields. The sensi- tivity of the testicles to low frequency electromagnetic fields seems particu- larly acute. Nonspecific problems that accom- pany cancer development are also associated with electromagnetic field exposure. These problems are highly correlated with a general, low level suppression of the body's immune system. Consequently, a general increase in sickness, that includes more frequent colds, flu, systemic infections and general lethargy, has been noted. Usually these complica- tions occur during the earlier period of exposure (or if a person is a new resident within the flap area). PSYCHOLOGICAL DEPRESSION AND SUICIDE RISK The types of electromagnetic fields that may be frequently generated in flap areas have also been shown to influence the body's daily (circadian) rhythms. In fact, there is some evi- dence that psychological depression occurs; it may be mediated by mela- tonin. This normal chemical, derived from the person's pineal organ that is buried deep within the brain, is inti- mately involved with mood and sleep. Exposures during the night time of less than one hour to low frequency magnetic fields have been shown to drastically affect the biological activity (including the sensation of pain) asso- ciated with melatonin. Melatonin is a part of a chemical pathway within the brain that produ- ces serotonin. Disruptions of this chemical system are known to pro- duce severe depressions and to increase the risk of suicide. Marked decreases in the concentration of serotonin in the brain stems of people who have committed suicide are well known observations. Recent experimental work with non-human primates have indi- cated that whereas other brain chem- ical systems return to normal follow- ing brief exposures to electromagnetic fields, the serotonin system remains suppressed. The occurrence of moderate depres- sion may be masked by substance abuse, such as alcoholism. Milder depressions may be hidden by psy- chological or personality disturban- ces, that include phobic responses (inappropriate fears) or panic attacks. During the latter the person may feel apprehensive, as if death is about to occur. Some mildly depressed people can become psychologically depend- ent upon specific rituals, such as jog- ging, that can reduce the unpleasant experience by elevating the body's own pain killers and euphoriants. PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDERS Epidemiologists have tended to avoid the spatial determination of psychiat- ric and psychological problems. The incidence of these occurrences are difficult to quantify because different professionals have tended to classify the same collection of symptoms (a syndrome) under different categories. In addition many psychiatric or psy- chological ailments are reversible or at least prone to remission, i.e., decrease in overt intensity over time. Although studies have not been completed, there should be a con- spicuous occurrence of a syndrome that involves enhanced temporal lobe signs. They are experiences and behaviors that reflect the function of this important area in the human brain. People who are already prone to temporal lobe sensitivity would be vulnerable to the effects of even brief exposure to the fields associated with UFO phenomena. The personality characteristics of these individuals have been discussed in another arti- cle for the MUFON Journal. In summary, they would be normal peo- ple who are suggestible, creative, emotionally labile, anxious, prone to philosophical and aesthetic interests MUFON UFO JOURNAL, No. 244, August 1988"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"(music, poetry, writing) and charac- terized by \"bursts of productive activity.\" Because of their intrinsically sensi- tive deep temporal lobe structures, such as the amygdala, these people would be susceptible to microseizur- ing during proximity to tectonic strain fields as they emerged within living areas. These electrochemical changes would not be obvious to the observer and would be similar to but more intense than those which occur nor- mally during dreaming. Consequently these people would have a profound experience that has personal and cosmic significance. The negative or positive residual of the experience would depend upon the intensity of the strain fields. If the experiences were painful or traumatic, then the symptoms would be very similar to the post-traumatic stress syndrome. After the experience, there might be widening of affect (everyday, mun- dane details appear to suddenly relate to the experience), and a sense of personal contact. Friends and family would note a marked change in the behavior. RADIOACTIVE GASES Radon gas emission has become a significant concern to environmental protection agencies. The release of radon gas from soils overlaying faulted acidious rocks (like quartz diorite) is a frequent natural phenomena. The most common health problem associated with radon gas is lung cancer. This gas can accumulate in domestic set- tings with poor air exchange, a factor that is often made worse in overly insulated houses. Whereas the lifetime risk of devel- oping lung cancer is only 0.3% in a house that contains 1.5 picoCurie (a unit of disintegration rates) of radon per liter, this estimate increases to 2% when the air contains more than eight picoCuries of radon per liter. It is estimated that more than one mil- lion houses in the U.S.A. alone exceed this value. During a recent measurement series, some houses contained values of more than 50 to 100 picoCuries per liter. Unfortunately these studies did not address the issue of seismic activity or of tectonic stress within the MUFON UFO JOURNAL, No. 244, August 1988 region. If the observations of Yasui and the assumptions of the tectonic strain theory are correct, then the inhabitants of houses near areas in which multiple UFO reports have occurred, could be exposed to exces- sive levels of radon gas. The concen- trations would rise and fall aperiodi- cally but over the duration of the flap the cumulative dosage would be sub- stantial. Only constant monitoring would discern the variability. IMPLICATIONS: UFO FIELD RESEARCHERS There are two important implica- tions of this recent research for UFO researchers. First, UFO field research- ers may be a high risk population for the development of these disorders. Secondly, populations in small areas (50 km) within which large numbers of UFO phenomena are frequently reported for several months to years might be expected to show an increas- ed incidence of brain tumors, leuke- mia (in children), lung cancer (depend- ing upon the type of bedrock), and depressive disorders. UFO field researchers, the men and women who have spent the grea- test amount of time visiting new UFO sites and who have experienced the most frequent proximity to luminous displays, would be particularly at risk. During some UFO flap periods, research- ers have actually camped near these areas. The brain tumor risk would be elevated in addition because of the immunosuppression that invariably ac- companies hectic traveling, disruption in sleep schedules and change. Testicular changes would be expected as well. That even 10 to 100 gauss magnetic fields (well below those inferred from the presence of actual luminous displays) can affect the activity of testes and the thymus gland (the major source of the bodies T-lymphocytes that are involved with fighting against tumors and foreign materials) is well known. Because these fields are likely to be promoters of cancer, testicular (including pros- trate) forms should be prevalent in older males. The psychological changes that occur following close proximity to a single UFO episode have been address- ed elsewhere; specific references are noted at the end of this article. How- ever, the psychological changes that could occur in UFO field researchers have been rarely considered. Whe- reas post-traumatic stress symptoms, such as recurrent distressing dreams of the event, hypervigilance, feelings of detachment, over-reactivity to noise, and panic attacks may emerge initially, an underlying psychological depres- sion may persist. Such depression would be suffi- cient to be treated medically; how- ever because it is likely to emerge slowly, learned substance (alcohol) abuse, a very common correlate of some types of depression, may mask the difficulty. Although depression suppresses the libido and reduces the ability to experience and give affec- tion, its most critical correlate is an increased risk of suicide. The major problem at present is dosimetry, that is, how much real exposure has occurred either during the more intense eposides or cumula- tively over a lifetime. Because appro- priate electromagnetic measurements are rarely taken and continuous mon- itoring of an active area is almost never completed, dosage levels have not been established. In addition, there are some UFO researchers who have had effectively little actual field proximity to UFO phenomena. Their exposure levels and hence risk factors would be sig- nificantly different from the more avid, close proximity researcher. IMPLICATION: VULNERABLE POPULATIONS The second application of this con- cept is to the community in (or around) which the high activity of phenomena occurred. People living in areas in which frequent luminous events were observed over long peri- ods should demonstrate an increased incidence of lung cancer, brain tumors, leukemia and psychiatric admissions for severe depressions. If the flap lasts for one or two years, the first symptoms would involve general immu- nosuppression as manifested by more frequent sickness and infections. Ele- vated numbers of treatment-requiring depressions and childhood leukemia 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"would follow, especially towards the end of the flap period. Brain tumors and related cancers should develop last. It is estimated that the incidence level would at least triple, but the actual value would depend upon the activity density of the flap (the number of UFO reports per unit area per unit time). Indices that might be used as inferences of the presence of tectonic strain fields within the vicin- ity would be the numbers of episodes of unexplained power surges, altera- tions in radio or (non-cable) television reception and the frequency of anoma- lous events. Certain locations in which a strong UFO flap occurred in a very small area for a long period are optimal because of the phenomenon of \"dose dependence.\" If there has been min- imal social mobility (people moving in and out of the area), the development of their disorders should be a func- tion of the numbers of and proximity to the major phenomena. Possible areas of investigation would include the Uintah Basin (after the 1967 flap), the Yakima region, Washington (1972-1975), Carman, Manitoba (1975- 1976), and Hessdalen, Norway (1984- 1985). Some of the strongest test cases are too far away in time to study. For example the October, 1917 luminous display in Fatima, Portugal was a classic luminous display that was observed by thousands of people. Two of the three children who had the most frequent and closest contact with the phenomenon died within three years after the incident. One of them died of symptoms that are markedly similar to a solid lung tumor associated with elevated calcium levels. Until recently UFO research has been primarily a fragmented endeavor with little support from the traditional sciences. However, as more data is collected and epidemiological methods are applied to populations who have multiple or single, intense exposures to UFO phenomena, perhaps a more accurate health risk estimate can be attained. It is important to emphasize that like all epidemiological pheno- mena the effects would be primarily detectable with large populations. Con- sequently, this does not mean neces- sarily that all people who have close UFO experiences will develop serious health problems.

The Gulf Breeze, Florida Photographic and CE III CASE - PART V By Donald M. Ware, Florida State Director, Charles D. Flannigan, Lead Investigator and Walter H. Andrus, Jr., International Director Copyrighted by the Mutual UFO Network, Inc. (MUFON) 1988 IMPROVED STEREO CAMERA The date May 1, 1988 appears to be the final set of photographs taken by Ed which was inaugurated on November 11, 1987 with the original five color Polaroid photos. Ed had taken the latest version of his \"self- referencing stereo camera (SRS)\" to Shoreline Park South in Gulf Breeze on five consecutive evenings starting April 26, 1988. The SRA camera, designed by Dr. Bruce S. Maccabee and built by Ed, consisted of two new Polaroid 600 LMS Sun Cameras, mounted two feet apart on a boom and supported by a heavy camera tripod. A sighting rod (broomstick) 6 with a screw on the end is 48% inches from the camera's lens plane. The camera rig had been stabilized using a triangle of plywood since the previously discussed photos of March 17 and 20 were taken. (See the June 1988 issue of MUFON UFO Journal page 16 lower left for a photograph of the SRS improved version.) As a further means of calibrating distances from the camera, a set of six tape- coded poles were placed 60 degrees apart in a circle at a ten foot radius from the camera point of rotation. MAY 1,1988 PHOTOS Ed set up his cameras each even- ing about 11:30 p.m. on the beach side of a concrete picnic table near the park pavillion (see photo of table, figure 1). Nothing was observed or photographed from April 26 through April 30th in spite of his persistence and patience. However, his efforts were to be rewarded after midnight on May 1, 1988 at 1:00 a.m. when he heard the familiar hum in his head as he sat in his pickup truck. He imme- diately manned his cameras. At 1:10 a.m. CDST he saw a lighted object in the southeast sky in the direction of the Bob Sykes Bridge. Simultane- ously photos with both the right and left hand cameras were taken. (See MUFON UFO JOURNAL, No. 244, August 1988"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"figure 2 in this article). After raising his. head, he observed another lighted object (UFO) in the same direction, but apparently smaller. The second object, appearing in the upper right corner of the photos in figure 2, looked like the object photo- graphed with the Nimslo 3-D camera on February 26, 1988. (See May 1988 issue number 241 of MUFON Journal page 14). Ed lowered his head to the viewfinder in preparation for taking a second set of stereo photos but could see nothing through the left view- finder. At this moment he raised his head and observed a bright object less than 30 feet above him. Ed flinched and inadvertently took a pic- ture with the right camera. He was immediately hit by a white light, which he referred to as a \"white-out\" in his head. He said his whole head went white and he lost control of his senses. He remembered falling, but not the sensation of hitting the ground. (See figure 3 for the second photo by the right camera). POSSIBLE ABDUCTION When Ed recovered his senses, he found that he was lying face down in the sand about 20 feet away from his camera set-up and closer to the Santa Rosa Sound beach. When he regained his feet, he felt unstable and dizzy as he observed the surround- ings. He walked back to the picnic table area and noticed that the time was now 2:25 a.m. (There was one hour and fifteen minutes of missing time, 1:10 to 2:25 a.m.). He said his head was throbbing and he had a horrible odor emanating from his right hand. The odor was coming from a black substance under his fin- gernails. When he collected his equip- ment, he left four of the tape-coded white poles behind. Considering what had happened to him, he did not feel that this loss was important. Ed drove from Shoreline Park South, arriving home about 3:00 a.m. The odor was so bad that he wrapped a wet towel around his right hand so that he would be able to sleep. He had a feeling or fear that his 13-year-old daughter might be abducted, so he sat with his back to her bedroom door until 6:00 a.m. Ed MUFON UFO JOURNAL, No. 244, August 1988 Figure 1. Shoreline Park South. Picnic table and park pavillion. went to bed at 6:00 a.m. When he awoke at 11:30 a.m., he went to the bathroom and saw three red marks on his face in the mirror. After calling Dr. Maccabee to report the additional photographs and missing time expe- rience, he removed the smelly black stuff and a portion of the clipped fin- gernails, which were placed in a jar and frozen. Ed had an abrasion between his eyes and on each temple, plus a knot on the back of his head. He took a photograph of the abrasion between his eyes and gave it to Charles Flan- nigan. Mr. Flannigan also took a photo of the abrasions on Ed's head which have been both filed with his report. The marks were visable for many days afterward, although there was no blood present to indicate an incision per se. Ed said there were apparently no other witnesses since none have come forward. Normally, his wife Frances accompanied him to Shore- line Park for the potential photo ses- sions, however she was chaperoning a group of high school students on a bus trip. Half of the black substance from under the fingernails on his right hand was given to the Pioneer Lab in Pensacola for analysis. The remainder will be analyzed elsewhere by Dr. Maccabee. The original Polaroid photographs (3) were sent to Dr. Maccabee for analysis. Following his preliminary analysis of the excellent parallax information, he said the bright light was about 500 feet away and 14 feet in diameter, and the \"Nimslo object\" was only 134 feet away and about three feet long. Slides of these photos were displayed by Dr. Maccabee and Walt Andrus in their presentations in Lincoln, Nebraska on June 25th. Ed realizes that the May 1st expe- rience may have been an abduction due to the missing time of 75 min- utes. He suspects that he may also have been abducted at the age of 17, 25, and 33. He said, \"he thinks they abducted him to remove his capabil- ity to hear the hum in his right fore- head.\" He hopes there will be no further incidents that have been inter- rupting their family life since November 11, 1987. It was explained to Ed by Walt Andrus that a tiny implant or 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Figure 2. May 1,1988. Stereo photographs of two different objects. communication device may have been inserted into his head at some prior time (November 11, 1987 or before) and possibly removed on May 1, 1988. He has agreed to undergo hyp- nosis regarding the May 1st event by a professional in the Pensacola area to explore the implant possibility and the potential abduction scenario(s). Investigation continues into this highly significant case, since it is conceivable that \"only the tip of the iceberg has been exposed.\" It relates to many other witnesses of reported UFOs, entities, and abductions in the imme- diate locale. It is no longer necessary to preface the Gulf Breeze, Florida Case with the disclaimer that it is either one of the most incredible cases in UFO his- tory or the most fantastically orches- trated hoax — one that would chal- lenge the production skills of Steven Spielberg to duplicate. The over- whelming evidence is in. Gulf Breeze is indeed one of the most incredible cases in modern UFO history. For the photo analysis by Dr. Bruce S. Maccabee please secure a copy of the MUFON 1988 Interna- tional UFO Symposium Proceedings for his paper titled \"A History of the Gulf Breeze, Florida Sighting Events\" (92 pages). Dr. Maccabee literally 8 Figure 3. Second photograph by right camera. demolished the objections of the skeptics and the unfounded accusa- tions made by people who labeled the case a hoax. No other case in UFO history has been composed of CE I, CE II, CE III, and CE IV attributes that could be studied and measured through modern scientific methods and techniques. Gulf Breeze is a solid case and you read it first in the MUFON UFO Journal as we prom- ised in the March 1988 issue.

He is trained in research psychol- ogy. After a thorough investigation of all pertinent facts, the UFO sighting reported by Dan Maclndoe of Oak Harbor on January 21, 1988 has been given the classification of a true \"unknown\". The Mutual UFO Net- work has ruled out all possible con- ventional explanations for the object seen by Mr. Maclndoe, his wife, mother, mother-in-law and father-in- law, and three-year-old daughter. Dan Maclndoe, age 32, an ex-Navy lieutenant with seven years military service in the field of aviation supply — including work assignments with the Navy's prestigious Blue Angels squadron — was rated as an excep- tionally credible witness by the MUFON organization. The UFO encounter began at 10:45 p.m. on the night of January 21st at the Maclndoe home not far from the Whidbey Island Naval Air Station. Flight operations at Whidbey NAS had by that time been over for 15 minutes, with the last plane reported \"on the deck\" at 10:30 p.m. The UFO was first observed by Cornelia Maclndca, age 72, Dan Maclndoe's mother, who sighted a bright, orange-yellow stationary light in the southern sky when she went outside to smoke a cigarette. She called the entire family's attention to the object, and together they watched as the UFO shot straight up for approximately three degrees of arc from a position of 25 degrees above the horizon in the direction of the Naval Air Station. The object then abruptly stopped, made a sharp right- angle turn in the horizontal direction and came straight towards them. According to Maclndoe's account, the object covered a distance of one and a half miles in approximately three seconds. As the UFO approach- MUFON UFO JOURNAL, No. 244, August 1988 ed the house it seemed to slow, tak- ing approximately 15 seconds to slowly drift directly over the heads of the five adult witnesses and child. It disappeared from view as it travelled in a straight path to the NNE, passing behind some tall fir trees behind the Maclndoe house. While the object was passing over- head Dan Maclndoe was able to observe the object through a 135mm telephoto lens, and was also able to determine that there was no sound associated with its flight. Mr. Macln- doe described the shape of the underside of the object as that of \"a perfect circle.\" LIGHTED CIRCUMFERENCE \"The lights were blueish-white in nature and I estimate 15 lights spanned the circumference of the circle. All remained on forming a circle of 'run- ning lights'. The lights would pulse brighter in sequence, I believe going in a clockwise direction,\" Dan Macln- doe reported. He went on to say, \"...during the event winds were calm, there were scattered clouds in the vicinity. We live in a rural area. There were no sounds. During the entire episode none of us heard the usual prop or jet noise associated with military air- craft using the airfield. At the time the object was directly overhead I asked my family for complete silence to listen for engine noise. There was absolute silence.\" According to Dr. Donald Johnson, Washington State Director for MUFON, a combination of factors were sufficient to rule out all mun- dane explanations for the sighting. \"The fact that this overflight occurred in restricted military airspace, together with the testimony of multiple wit- nesses, the complete lack of sound, the observation of the unusual light- ing pattern on the object seen through magnification, and the lack of wind combine to provide sufficient informa- tion to classify this case as an unknown.\" \"In other words, there is little pos- sibility that the object the Maclndoes and others reported seeing that night was a satellite, balloon, commercial or military airplane or helicopter, or astronomical body.\" The National Weather Service and Whidbey NAS were called to confirm that there were no weather balloons released at that time. Additionally, several of Mr. Maclndoe's Dugualla Bay neighbors and others from as far away as Lake Washington, Edmonds, and Bellingham called him to report that they had also witnessed unusual lights in the sky that evening. Dr. Johnson reports that the field investigation has been evaluated by the National headquarters as com- plete. The sighting was assigned a strangeness rating of four on a five- point scale — labelled as \"strange, does not conform to known princi- ples\"; it also received a probability rating of four on a five point scale — \"credible and sound.\" (Further information on this report may be obtained from Donald A.

MACINDOE NARRATIVE \"On Thursday, 1-21-88, at approx- imately 2000 hrs,, my mother, age 72, went outside on the porch to smoke a cigarette. The weather was mostly clear with scattered clouds. Navy flight ops were being conducted with occasional flyovers by A6/EA6B 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"aircraft doing touch-and-gos. \"My mother called my attention to an unusually bright object at about the 10 o'clock position to the SW as we looked out our family room win- dow. The object would brighten and dim with occasional flashes of blue and red. (Note: this object has been positively identified as either the star Sirius or Rigel; both stars in that sec- tion of the sky now and Mr. Macln- doe has verified that a bright star has been in the same spot as the object his mother saw on subsequent nights — Don Johnson.) My initial impres- sion was that this was probably a Navy helicopter conducting flight oper- ations to the SW. \"There was intermittent cloud cover which would occasionally obscure the object. From 2000 - 2200 members of my family made numerous trips to the window to look at the object. I noted the object would change posi- tions (laterally) from time to time but never more than 3-5 degrees left or right (Note: this apparent motion was due to scintillation and optical illu- sion, as this object has been identified as a star — Don Johnson.) \"The object I and members of my family witnessed was a curiosity but nothing dramatic due to the distance and size. I know it was not a star, planet, or satellite passing overhead. As time went on my helicopter theory became weaker as I could not under- stand one hovering in almost the same spot for more than two hours. \"We watched TV from approxi- mately 2200 to 2245 without making another observation. \"At 2245 my mother again went outside to smoke a cigarette. She immediately called for me to come outside in a distressed voice. I, my wife, 3-year-old daughter, and my wife's father all ran out on the front porch and my wife's mother observed through the window. \"Our observations over the next 25-30 seconds are as follows and we all agree on the following description: \"We saw a ball of light yellowish/- white in color and in the same posi- tion or relationship to the trees as the object sighted earlier in the evening but now much closer and lower in the sky. I estimate the glowing object 10 was l l / 2 - 2 miles from our home to the SW placing it at south side of Dugualla Bay Flats. I estimate its ele- vation to be 100' above tree level. Within 2-3 seconds the object moved from a stationary position. \"The bright ball of light took off vertically at a terrific high rate of speed, from a dead start to perhaps 1000- 1500 feet up and immediately changed direction from vertical to lateral. My mother exclaimed 'here it comes' as the light moved directly at us and covered a distance of l l / 2 miles in approximately three seconds. As it approached our house it seemed to slow, taking approximately 15 seconds to slowly drift directly overhead and disappear from view as it went to the NE. We lost sight as our view became blocked by our roof. We were standing on the front porch. \"I viewed the object from the time it reached its vertical position to the time it disappeared behind the house through a telephoto camera lens. I took my eyes away from the camera when the object was straight above our position thus viewing the object both with my camera lens and the naked eye. As it moved to an over- head position the bright ball of light was no longer visible as if it were turned off. \"When the object was directly overhead its shape was that of a per- fect circle. We determined the shape from the light pattern now clearly visible. \"The lights were blueish-white in nature and I estimate 15 lights spanned the circumference of the circle. All remained on forming a circle of 'run- ning lights'. The lights would pulse brighter in sequence, I believe going in a clockwise direction. I could not make out the body of the craft and the circular description is based on the light pattern only. \"During the event winds were calm, there were scattered clouds in the vicinity. We live in a rural area. There were no sounds. During the entire episode none of us heard the usual prop or jet noise associated with military aircraft using the airfield. At the time the object was directly overhead I asked my family for com- plete silence to listen for engine noise. There was absolute silence. \"Our family ran into the house after the object disappeared over the roof top. We were all visibly shaken but not terrified. We began to com- pare notes on what each of us saw and agreed on the description I have provided. \"At approximately 2255 I called NAS Whidbey's weather office and inquired if there were any unusual lights sighted. The answer was no, but a log entry was made on my report by the Forecast Duty Officer. \"I next called NAS Whidbey's duty office and again made the same inquiry. Again I was told there were no sightings reported. The Duty Petty Officer took my name and number. \"The third and final phone call was made to my older brother Doug in California. I had a strong urge or need to talk to someone who I know would take me seriously. I knew Doug took UFO sightings seriously having himself believed to have made a sighting in the desert years ago. This conversation concluded and our family again recounted the events and compared notes. We went to bed at approximately 2330, all of us feeling uneasy.\" DREAM \"I awakened Friday morning (1-22-88) at approximately 630 having suffered a nightmare which involved a craft above our house which bathed the house in light. I had a feeling of ter- ror. We were all awake by 7 AM and comparing notes once again. We went over the events again and again leaving no doubt among us that we all saw the same thing. \"At approximately 0800 I called NAS operations to ask if they had any lights in the area at 2245 the night before. I was told by the Duty Chief that all flight operations were secured at 2230. Our sighting was at 2245 and the object was in NAS Whidbey's restricted air space. When sighted above the tree level approxi- mately iy 2 miles from our house I would estimate the object was within 200 yards of the eastern end of NAS Whidbey's runway. \"I hesitated to make the next call MUFON UFO JOURNAL, No. 244, August 1988"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"\\ \\, but felt a strong need to find some- one else who at least might have seen the bright light. I called the local radio station in Oak Harbor and talked to Dur Roberson the Radio D.J. At first I cautiously asked if anyone had phoned and verified our sighting. The answer was no. I then told our story. He made a tape and put it on the air and I hoped it would draw out some- one else who had seen the light over Dugualla Bay. Within minutes I was beseiged with calls from Seattle Radio and TV shows. I granted interviews with them in the hopes the increased exposure would put us in contact with someone who viewed the ob- ject.\" WITNESS PROFILES Dan Maclndoe (principal witness) birthdate 2/22/56, age 32.

MUFON Amateur Radio Net Report FORTY METER NET activity con- tinues to grow, with new check-ins almost every week. The Eastern Sec- tion of the net opens at 0800 EST/EDT on 7237 KHz with WA3QLW, Har- risburg, PA, and K8NQN, Cincinnati, OH, acting as net control stations on alternate months. On March 12, eighteen stations were privileged to hear Stan Gordon, MUFON State Director for Pennsylvania, summarize recent UFO activity. We thank WB3AMR, Charles King of Greens- burg, PA, who phone-patched him on the air. We hope to transmit reports from other states as the directors begin to utilize our communication abilities. During the second hour of the net, stations in the Central and Mountain Time Zones are encouraged to check in as the Section II of the net is acti- vated. Eight stations checked in on March 5 at 0800 Central Time. WD8ARZ was pleased to report that sixteen stations participated in the second section of the net on March 12, including seven new check-ins. We look forward to even more activ- ity as word spreads about the more convenient time and better propaga- tion conditions for those who live west of the Mississippi. WOTID, Duane Sanderson in Topeka, KA, is wel- comed back as a regular. We're par- ticularly glad to have NY2X, Charles Huffer, a MUFON State Section Director, aboard from Fayetteville, MUFON UFO JOURNAL, No. 244, August 1988 By Dave Dobbs, K8NQN AR. W5UAA, WA5CTJ, and WAOOBN are a few of the other regulars help- ing to establish the Central Section. NG1E in Boulder, CO, is a key sta- tion in the effort to roll the net west- ward into the Mountain Time Zone at 0800 MST/MDT. He is mighty lone- some at this point and is looking for check-ins from the mountain states as well as potential net control sta- tions for that part of the country. Mountain and Pacific Time Zone members, fire up those rigs! We will be interested in reports of activity from the Pacific Coast area as the 0800 PST/PDT net begins to operate. The Sunday ten meter net can be used to liaison back. Please keep us informed. TEN METER NET activity is improv- ing, despite spotty propagation on that band. Conditions will get better as we move into the longer daylight hours of summer, and the new suns- pot cycle ionizes the upper atmos- phere to provide the necessary reflec- tion of signals. WD8ARZ reports reg- ulars are beginning to check in every week. Excitement prevailed on March 6 when 8P6GG from Barbados check- ed into the net! Art told the net, \"We don't see UFOs in Barbados like you do there in the States.\" He was invited to be a regular participant, nevertheless. Because of the interna- tional potential of the ten meter net, WD8ARZ intends to keep the time at 2000 Z when Daylight Savings Time begins. This will shift the net from 3 pm to 2 pm on Sundays. The net meets on 21470 KHz USB to permit Novice and Technician Class opera- tors to participate. We anticipate increasing involvement of MUFON members in this net in the coming months.

His company, Admiral Photo-Video, offers video transfer and duplica- tion in Seattle, Washington, and he manufactures and installs elec- tronic equipment for film produc- tion and theatrical projection. Unfortunately the time has passed when a photograph could be taken as irrefutable evidence of anything. Hoax- es can be perpetrated via techniques used in the motion picture industry, which will be reviewed; by video effects equipment, which will be men- tioned briefly; and by in-camera trick photography, of which examples will be shown. MOTION-PICTURE VISUAL EFFECTS A statement was recently published to the effect that there are no films made for reproducing negatives as negatives. The perpetrator of that remark was evidently unfamiliar with the wide range of special motion pic- ture emulsions, primarily made by Eastman Kodak, for just that pur- pose. For a visual effect sequence, original photography may be done with Eastman Color Negative 5247, Eastman Special Application Negative 5295, or other materials. A duplicate negative can be made directly on Eastman Color Reversal Intermediate 5249, or through two generations (color master positive and color dupli- cate negative) on Eastman Color Intermediate 5243. A blue screen is used for generating mattes (pronounced \"mats\") to permit or prevent certain picture elements from showing in the duplicate negative. A range of B&W films is available for making mattes from the original color negative. The field of modern visual effects is too complex and specialized to fully 12 Figure 1. Polaroid UFO Photo. describe here. For a taste of what is possible, though, the reader may refer to the July 1988 American Cinematographer magazine for a dis- cussion of the current effects film \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\" For a typical shot discussed in detail, some 14 film elements and mattes were combined in an optical printer with microscopic precision, correct expo- sure, correct color balance, etc. to produce a visually believable result. One could say that inserting a simple UFO vehicle into another negative would be child's play by comparison. Only a fairly expert technician could tell, by examining the resulting dupli- cate negative (if it were made availa- ble to him) that it was a duplicate and not an original negative. Telltale signs would be different edge printing, pos- sibly different perforation shape, pos- sibly different density and coloration of the film base. It may be worth men- tioning that the effects generations of most high-budget films use a resur- rected Vista Vision format, using eight perforation pairs per frame, nearly identical to the normal 35mm still photography format. Release prints are made on the normal four-perforation 35mm or five-perforation 70mm film. Other tricks can be done in the camera, eliminating the need for slow, costly, grain-inducing optical printing. Some of these will be mentioned in the section after next. VIDEO EFFECTS EQUIPMENT A photographed or video image can be stored in computerized form and manipulated, altered, combined with other images, distorted into odd shapes, and then displayed in video form or else photographed to yield a \"hard copy\" of the electronic signal. With the high-resolution digitizing into thousands of scanning lines, it may not be possible to detect that the image has been altered, particularly if it is rephotographed on ordinary color negative or color slide film. It would not show any of the telltale signs of being a duplicate negative that had been generated through special printing. Video effects do not require the degree of commitment of someone making a \"Star Wars\" film where tens MUFON UFO JOURNAL, No. 244, August 1988"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"of millions of dollars are spent on special and optical effects. A few thousand dollars' worth of equipment, or more, is required but many of these systems are in use nationwide and it is not out of the question for a bored technician to fabricate a hoax on a slow night. IN-CAMERA TRICK PHOTOGRAPHY A little imagination and some fairly ordinary equipment will enable a per- son to make convincing pictures. One technique borrowed from the movies is the glass shot. Here, a medieval fortress (or UFO) is painted on or attached to a large pane of glass to save the expense of building a real one. Details such as people walking in the distance are photo- graphed through an unpainted por- tion of the glass at the same time as the finished painting. Attention must be paid to adequate depth of field, using a large piece of glass, a high light level, and a small aperture. A piece of glass can also be used as a mirror. Held at an angle, it will make the object reflected in it have a transparent ghostly appearance. The actors can interact with each other in real time and avoid the bother of double exposures or laboratory trickery. By partial mirrors and controlled lighting an object can be made to change shape or disappear. Double exposures can be of two basic kinds; where the entire film area is exposed more than once; or where portions are masked off during certain exposures to allow certain areas to register. In the whole-film double exposure, objects that are moved between exposures will take on a ghostly, transparent appearance. Where portions are masked off, unre- lated scenes can be recorded on the same frame. With careful attention to exposure, degree of softness of the edge of the mask, and composition, a completely convincing picture can be faked, and here again nothing can be deduced by carefully examining the negative. One person can become twins; spectral apparitions can haunt the living. Through animation, inanimate ob- MUFON UFO JOURNAL, No. 244, August 1988 Figure 2. \"Paranormal\" Trickery jects can be made to move. This is done by exposing movie film one frame at a time, and moving the sub- ject between frames so your hand doesn't show in the picture. A telltale sign of this stop-motion filming is that the moving object is too sharp and shows no motion blur. High-budget effects films have overcome this prob- lem by a secret technique dubbed \"go-motion\" where the miniatures are moved slightly during each exposure to prevent their looking too sharp. Objects can be suspended on arma- tures behind them attached to the wall, or suspended from the ceiling and photographed from below. For outer-space epics, often the space- ship is stationary and the camera moves instead under computer con- trol. The pole holding it up is removed optically later because it is painted the same color as the blue screen. Objects can be supported by exceedingly fine wires that will not show if conditions are right. In front-screen projection an object can have anything as a background, which is actually film being projected onto a special retro-reflective screen material. By interlocked zooming of the projector and camera, \"Super- man\" for example flies towards you without moving. Following are UFO and paranormal photos that were faked without the use of any unusual equipment. FIG. 1. UFO POLAROID PHOTO Our startled witness sees a dark and menacing UFO overhead. Luck- ily he has his Polaroid 210 pack camera loaded with type 108 film. He manages a grab shot before the thing streaks back to Clarion. A learned investigator knows that the 210 has shallow depth of field, so the UFO must have been the same distance as the trees. He solemnly pronounces the photo to be genuine. Actually, our intrepid hoaxer has been giving some thought to this problem. He knows that at the nor- mal ASA 75 film speed setting the Polaroid shoots at about F/10 so the 12\" paper cutout taped to his bed- room window comes out too fuzzy to be believable. He toys with the film speed slider, trying the ASA 3000 set- ting, and as expected the next photo is too dark to see as it was underex- posed by a factor of 40; however the depth of field at the resulting F/64 aperture is good enough. He lacks a 1.6ND filter to put over the photocell window to correct the exposure, and puts his little finger over it instead. He braces himself for the long (1 second) exposure and produces the photo shown. 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Largely by accident, the picture is pretty convincing. The slight fuzzi- ness and underexposure, together with the bad composition, gives just the right effect. Subsequent pictures with better composition and expo- sure, and using a better and 35mm pro-grade camera, are actually less convincing and take on a pretty hokey appearance. These are not shown publicly. FIG. 2. 35mm PARANORMAL PHOTO The author, left, does a \"doppel- take\" as his doppelganger leers at him from the stairway. The spectre needs only to steal the eyeglasses to assume a solid form, meanwhile con- signing the victim to an eternal void in the 39th dimension ... Or, this could be a triple exposure with the camera (a Ricoh XR-P) firmly mounted on a tripod. Using the multiple-exposure capability and manu- al exposure settings (found on a number of good cameras) and a black paper mask that only allows the left or right half to be seen at one time, this can be done in a minute without accomplices who might some- day recant. Locking in a manual exposure, determined before affixing the paper mask, the hoaxer sets the camera's self-timer and poses at left. Without advancing the film, two more exposures are made at right, each with half the exposure of the first so the two will add up to an equal brightness. Again using the self-timer, one exposure is made including the hoaxer (sans glasses) and one is made without him giving a transpar- ent ghostly appearance. Since he was careful not to move the camera between exposures, and the largely out-of-focus black paper gives soft edges to the transition area in the center of the picture, no dividing line is to be seen. In the foregoing the author does not mean to imply that any particular photos have been faked, but just that techniques are available for doing so. My regret is that now, if I ever take a genuine UFO or paranormal picture it may prove impossible to prove its authenticity! LOOKING BACK By Bob Gribble FORTY YEARS AGO - August 1948: At noon on the llth, two young boys were playing in their backyard at Hamel, Minnesota, when they noticed a strange object des- cending from the sky approximately 12 feet from the ground. The object settled to the ground gently. Upon landing, the UFO spun once, made a whistling sound, and then shot straight up into the air approximately 20 feet, stopped, and again made a whistling sound. The object then shot upward to a height of about 30 feet, and, dur- ing this ascent, maneuvered around tree branches and utility wires. When the UFO reached a height of approx- imately 30 feet, it moved away to the northeast at a high rate of speed. The boys described the object as about one foot thick, two feet wide, and circular. The UFO had no windows, wires, or any visible appendages. It was a dull gray in color, and when it hit the ground it made a slight clank- ing noise, like metal hitting metal. In the spot where the. object landed investigators found an impression two feet in diameter. Within the impres- sion rocks had been pressed into the ground and were level with the soil. *** THIRTY-FIVE YEARS AGO - August 1953: About the first of the month Berryman Davids took off from Seattle, Washington in his A'eron- ca Chief airplane. He climbed to 10,000 feet, leveled off and headed for the Cascade Mountain range to the southeast. No clouds and bright sun- light. Suddenly the whole cockpit was drenched in dazzling-white, intense light. The pilot circled to try to determine the source of the light. After a 90-degree turn back toward Seattle, the blinding light hit the air- craft again. Then the pilot saw the source: 12 bright metallic craft, per- haps a mile away. One object turned on its side and the sun caught it as a huge mirror. And again the blinding light for a couple seconds. The pilot flew toward the objects which were playing like a school of dolphins. As he neared the objects he could see they were disc-shaped. They would ascend straight up until out of sight, then descend at fantastic speed, three of the discs descended just in front of his aircraft, heading for the ground at high velocity. Just as they were about to crash they suddenly reversed direction and went straight up at high speed. That was enough for the pilot. He left the area 14 as fast as his Chief would take him. A woman in the Ground Observer Corps in the Black Hills of South Dakota reported a light hovering in the sky to the east of her position on the night of the 12th. Two operators from a radar station went out to check visually while the woman was still on the telephone. While they were scanning the sky the woman reported, \"The thing is beginning to move over Rapid City.\" Simultane- ously, the two radar men observed the light start to move. They returned to their radar, while the woman reported that the object was moving back to its original position. The radar got a fix on it at that spot. An F-84, in the air at the time, was vec- tored in to the target, the pilot mak- ing visual contact. The object headed north with the jet in pursuit, radar tracking both blips. The UFO stayed ahead of the jet and seemed to main- tain distance whenever the pilot speeded up the jet. After chasing the object 120 miles, the pilot ran low on fuel and was granted permission to return. When he turned around, the UFO also turned and followed. After the first jet landed, a second F-84 went up to investigate. He was talked into posi- MUFON UFO JOURNAL, No. 244, August 1988"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"tion and spotted the thing visually above him. He went up to 20,000 feet, reported that he was level with the light, and again the object took off to the north with the jet in pur- suit. Again the chase was observed on ground radar, with both the UFO and the jet showing plainly on the scope. When the pilot thought he was closing in on the object, he switched on his radar gun sights. This type of jet has a light on the instru- ment panel to indicate a \"lock on\". The light came on. The second jet chased the light 160 miles to the north before abandoning the pursuit. This time the UFO con- tinued flying north. The Ground Observer Corps Filter Center ahead was alerted and observers there reported a light speeding north. This was an incredible UFO incident. There were simultaneous visual sight- ings from two ground sites linked by telephone, simultaneous ground and radar sightings, simultaneous ground- radar and jet-visual sightings, a pur- suit in which the UFO outran the jet, a reversal in course, a second jet- visual sighting confirmed by radar, an air-radar \"lock on\" and finally a sight- ing from the ground hundreds of miles away. *** TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO — August 1963: Ronnie Austin, 18, and Phyllis Bruce, 18, were driving near Fairfield, Illinois on the 4th, about 11 PM, when they spotted a big, white object moving along just above the tree tops. It looked as big as an automobile. At first the object was on the south side of the road and then it crossed over in front of their car to the north side, at one point coming within 100 feet of the car. The radio went crazy, so Ronnie turned it off. When he reached his girl's house the object hovered in the area around the home. As soon as he pulled away from the house, the UFO began to follow. \"I really poured the coal to the car and I must have been doing 120 MPH (sic) when I topped the hill on the gravel road not far from our place,\" Ronnie said. \"I was coming into a dead end spot on the roadway MUFON UFO JOURNAL, No. 244, August 1988 and the object seemed to exert some strange force on my car, otherwise I would never have been able to make the turn. It slowed me down at an unbelieveable rate of speed. \"Then the thing came straight for me and hovered over my car. My car engine started to miss ... it would hardly go ... finally the engine stopped running. I didn't know what was going to happen then. Then the light moved over to the side of the high- way, overhead, and my car started. I raced for home. I ran inside and woke up dad and mom. They thought I was drunk or had gone crazy. Dad ran outside and took one look and ran back inside for his gun. When the object saw that gun it seemed to move right toward us. We ran back inside. The UFO was round and moved with the most ungodly speed I ever saw ... I can't imagine what it was.\" On the 9th, a fireball as big as a washtub hovered over the home of a former Mt. Vernon, Illinois mayor. Harry L. Bishop said the fireball he saw \"coming right down the Centralia Road from the north was the bright- est red light I have ever seen. It appeared to be only about 300 or 400 feet high, was oval-shaped and was about the size of a washtub. When it got over my house it stopped and I could see it very clearly. Although it was bright red it did not light up the neighborhood. It seemed to be mak- ing a light whirring sound. I noticed a car coming down the Centralia Road. It stopped suddenly and the driver jumped out and looked upwards. He saw the object, too, and it startled him to a stop.\" When the car stopped, the light turned, hovered overhead, then moved off westward. \"I thought those people at Fairfield were crazy when I read about the strange things they have been seeing in the sky,\" said Bishop, \"but I've changed my mind...\" *** TWENTY YEARS AGO - Au- gust 1968: Mrs. Harold B. Eggers of Mt. Airy, North Carolina, was awa- kened by the frantic barking and scratching on the front door of her home at 2:30 AM (date unknown). When she got out of bed she heard a penetrating sound like a \"huge swarm of bees,\" and when she opened the door her dog ran and hid under her bed with his paws covering its ears. Before closing the door Mrs. Eggers saw a circular UFO with a dome on its top, divided by 12 square open- ings, hovering about 50 feet off the ground, some 90 feet away from her home. She estimated the UFO to be about six or seven feet high and 15 feet in diameter. The base appeared to be aluminum (in the glow of the full moon) and reddish-orange lights shown from inside the numerous openings. Her first reaction was to shut the door immediately. Almost at the same time the house lights dimmed, which she then turned off. Through a bedroom window she could see what appeared to be a strange-looking, small being peering at her through one of the openings of the hovering UFO. The occupant wore a sort of silver helmet and appeared to be about three to four feet tall, and clothed in some sort of tight-fitting uniform. Finally the UFO departed. The next morning Mrs. Eggers discovered that her three electric clocks had lost about an hour overnight and that a power failure had occurred in the immediate neigh- borhood that same evening. She suf- fered from sleeplessness, dimming of vision and headaches, off and on for several days after the incident. *** FIFTEEN YEARS AGO - Au- gust 1973: Experts at an Army mis- sile base at Huntsville, Alabama said they were puzzled about strange \"ghost ships\" picked up on powerful radar screens in the Pacific during a tracking exercise. There had been lit- tle official comment on what the scientists found during the exercise but, Major Dallas Van Hoose, an Army spokesman, confirmed that \"some unexplained aerial phenomena\" were observed. Scientists, many of whom were reluctant to be named because of general public skepticism over UFOs, said privately they have been unable to find any explanation for the 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"\"ghost ships.\" \"We have never seen anything precisely like this before,\" said one ballistic missile defense expert who works for an Army agency at Hunts- ville, and who is familiar with the advanced radar used to test missiles and warheads. Huntsville houses the Army's ballis- tic missile defense system command, which analyzes results of tests in the Kwajalein Atoll region of the Marshall Island Trust Territory. In August the Air Force launched a Minuteman from Vandenburg AFB, California, aimed for the Kwajalein target area. Radar experts in the Pacific found they were also tracking a UFO next to the ICBM's nose cone. It was picked up to the right and above the descending nose cone, and tracked while it crossed the warhead's trajec- tory until it was below and to the left, before vanishing. The ghost blip was described as 10 feet high and 40 feet long. Two separate radar systems saw it at the same time, decreasing the likelihood of a malfunction in one of the sets. Three other similar objects were in the vicinity. One scientist said the data indicated that the phantom ship \"flew under its own power,\" but could not explain what sort of power that might be. So far, none of the experts at Huntsville believe the ghost ship was a natural phenomenon caused by freak weather conditions or echoes commonly seen on radar screens. *** TEN YEARS AGO - August 1978: Terry Mayo reported his motor- cycle was passed by a strange flying object that \"looked like a cup inverted on top of a saucer,\" as he drove to his Buffalo Shoals, North Carolina home prior to 11 PM on the llth. According to Mayo, \"the object was about the size of a four of five room farmhouse. It was domed on the top and flat on the bottom and gave off a yellowish-white light.\" When it passed near his motorcycle it caused the lights to go out and the engine to stop. Then it hovered nearby for about one minute, lifted up, then shot straight up into the sky with a loud humming. When the UFO left the area, the cycle lights came on auto- matically, but his starter switch did not work. Larry Jenkins saw his first UFO at Strasburg, Virginia, at 9 PM on the 17th. He said it was about 18 feet in diameter, round in front and the back looked like it was blocked off. It had a red and green light which illumi- nated the sky as the object hovered just about the ground. Then the UFO began to glow and a mist or fog sur- rounded it. Both Jenkins and his sis- ter, as well as his son and three daughters said the light was so bright it hurt their eyes. \"It made my hair stand straight up in the air,\" said Jenkins. Jenkins said the police arrived 10 to 15 minutes after the thing dis- appeared in a shroud of mist. Letter To the Editor Dear Editor, I was interested to read Jerome Clark's article in MUFON Journal June 1988. However, he calls me to task a little unnecessarily. At no time was I suggesting that the subcons- cious belief in the extraterrestrial hypothesis was either all-pervading or religious in contect. My article (MUFON Journal, April 1988) actually suggested that there were some altruistic Ufologists who could legitimately say \"yes\" to the question that I posed. They would be involved in the subject even if it were demonstrated that aliens had nothing to do with it. However, I am sur- prised that Jerry considers it bad psychology to try to see inside peo- ple's heads and second guess motives for interest in UFOs. In fact, of course, I can only really speak for British UFO enthusiastics. But I strongly suspect the same is true of the USA. It should be remembered that serious Ufologists are comparatively few. BUFORA, for example, has around 300 members. 16 Yet its \"hard core\" — ie those-who are long term committed and in any sense professionalized is at best per- haps 30-50 people. I doubt if a similar percentage does not apply to organi- zations such as MUFON or CUFOS. What this means is that the major- ity of those involved in the UFO field are there for reasons not connected with either altruism or their desire to find the truth. That remains the pro- vince of a handful. My contention comes from experience at meeting many of them over the past 15 years and receiving literally hundreds of let- ters a year from readers of my books or the \"grass roots\" of Ufology. What this has revealed about the matter is fascinating. There is no question, certainly in Britain, that most of these people have an inner compulsion that (con- sciously or subconsciously) wishes to see the UFO phenomenon proven to be extra-terrestrial in nature. Frankly, I am surprised this is even regarded as a controversial statement. What might make controversial is its extension to others — the real Ufologists, if you like. Those amongst whom both Jerry and I would doubt- less count ourselves — although the definition probably accomodates itself according to whomsoever you are. I was brave/foolish/honest (take your pick!) by admitting that there is something of this vague hope inside of me. It would not be immediately recognizable from my books, articles or lectures, because I strive so hard to remain objective. Indeed, I suspect that I counteract the tendency so much that I over-rebel against the ETH in an effort to remain \"unbiased.\" My feeling is that others probably are similarly inclined, without neces- sarily realizing it. Let us face it. Unless you are a specialist with a legiti- mate reason for interest in UFOs, then you are brought up with the mythical ideal that UFO and space- ships are synonymous terms. You can hardly avoid it (at least you could not when I got involved) as it is soaked through the fabric of popular books, cultural media and virtually MUFON UFO JOURNAL, No. 244, August 1988"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"every public presentation of the sub- ject. You have to \"unlearn\" the truths about UFOs (as perceived by the tab- loid press or the mass market books). That takes time and because you are unlikely to be attracted to the field in the first place unless a hope was sneaking somewhere inside that it may be like that, then what would have attracted you? Of course, I know it is true that you can grow out of the indoctrina- tion of the ETH. But it is a painful process of evolution and I am merely suggesting a hypothesis I consider to be valid. Maybe hardly any of us ever totally escapes. Otherwise why does the ETH remain such a vital part of the UFO phenomenon? Realistically, it is not because of its overwhelming support from the evidence. Jerry proposes that the lack of photographic evidence for abductions is not persuasive, citing the interest- ing analogy that there are no pictures of assault, rape or murder. Interest- ing, but not wholly correct for two reasons. There are some secondary obser- vations of murder and a few have been captured on film (even TV cameras). True enough, the witness is hardly going to take a time-out to photograph the assailant. There are rather more important things to be doing! This has a degree of relevance to abductees. However, there are plenty of long duration observations of entities in non-stressful situations where photography would be feasible. Also the problem with photographic evidence is not confined to the abductees themselves. Nobody pho- tographs (or even sees) someone else being abducted. And there are so few modem photographs of craft-like UFOs that even pass first base in analysis that it is a major question we have to face. When camera ownership, qual- ity of cameras and film have all vastly improved over the pat 30 years why are we reduced to citing as proof of good UFO pictures the McMinnville, Oregon shots from 1950 or the Tri- nidad Island ones from 1958, plus a very few others? We ought to be get- ting dozens of good new cases each year. We aren't. I have yet to hear any sort of answer as to why. MUFON UFO JOURNAL, No. 244, August 1988 I strongly suspect we need to look deeper at the people who mold the evidence (ie both the witnesses and the Ufologists). This is partially veri- fied by the study that Dr. Shirley Mclver made for her Sociology PhD at York University in England. Shirley analyzed motives of the BUFORA membership (a potted sum- mary can be found on pages 1987-188 of the book Science and the UFOs, by Peter Warrington and myself — recently issued in a paperback edition by Blackwell Inc. of New York). Cru- cially she discovered that 44% of people believed that UFOs were the product of physical extra-terrestrials travelling to earth. That was easily the most favored hypothesis. There is no stigma attached to this. It is human nature and necessary we understand that. The problem comes more from our failure to acknowledge the same trend inside us. An unrec- ognized problem is far more danger- ous than one that is spotted and guarded against. As to Jerome interpreting my words as religious in nature, that is totally wrong but fascinating as to why he did so. What I actually said was that the inner temptation leads us towards seeing UFOs as the consequence of \"advanced alien visitors who have come here, will change the world and maybe help us get out of the mess we are in.\" However, this statement was adapted by Jerry to fit in with CSICOP ram- blings about pseudo-mysticism and religion. All I suggested was that the aliens are seen as a kind of \"interga- lactic cavalry\". They act as a Super- man substitute. We have made a mess of things, in terms of our envir- onment, nuclear weapons, etc. Science does not appear to be finding the answers quickly enough. The desper- ation this engenders has the natural result of fostering a wish for some wise alien souls who have solved the problems to come here and tell us what we are doing wrong. The UFO phenomenon is in many respects exactly what the doctor ordered. Of course, there are two ways of looking at this. Either our innate desires are twisting the evi- dence and producing blinkered per- ception of the issues. Or else the answer is what it seems to be and we are merely responding to our intuition of a great truth. I suspect a bit of both possibilities might be involved. But I do not know the truth, as does nobody else, of course. All I am trying to show is a tendency towards the ETH within many UFO researchers. It works both ways, good and bad, for and against objectivity. But it is better we admit that it exists and not sweep it under the rug.

Webb MUFON Astronomy Consultant August 1988 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Mars, in Cetus, rises in the east shortly before 10 PM in midmonth. Shin- ing at magnitude -2, our ruddy neighbor now rivals Jupiter in brightness. Usually Mars is a disappointing small disc except when Earth catches up to it every 26 months. Its diameter exceeds 20 seconds of arc from August 19 to October 24 — the best period to observe the planet. Mars begins retrograde or westward motion on the 26th. See the July Night Sky. Saturn, in Sagittarius, is low in the southern sky at dusk. The yellowish ringed planet (magnitude +0.4) resumes direct or eastward motion on the 30th. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus rises in the NE about 2:30 AM in mid-August, reaching its farthest point west of the Sun on the 22nd. Its magnitude is -4.3. Mars is visible in the SW at dawn. Jupiter, in Taurus, rises in the NE below the Pleiades about midnight in the middle of the month and is high in the SE at dawn. The giant shines at magnitude -2.4. Saturn sets in the WSW about 1:30 AM (mid-August). Partial Lunar Eclipse. The northern limb of the full moon enters the Earth's shadow on the morning of August 27. Weather permitting, all of North America except the East will see the partial eclipse. The Moon slips into the dark central shadow (umbra) at 5:07 AM CDT, is 30 percent (maximum) eclipse at 6:05, and leaves the umbra at 7:02. Meteor Showers: Unlike last year, there is no moonlight to spoil the annual Perseids shower which climaxes on the morning of the 12th. The optimum time to watch a meteor shower generally is between midnight and dawn — especially toward dawn when about one Perseid per minute can be glimpsed. In addition, the July Aquarids continue into mid-August.

Each State Director received a packet of informational material that may be reproduced in appropriate quantities, prepared by Marge Christensen. Some State Directors revised their previous pub- licity material and have already com- pleted their plans for photo exhibits, handouts, lectures, media publicity, etc. UFO public education and information is high on MUFON's priority list. In the July issue of the Journal it was announced that George R. Coyne and Jennie Zeidman be- came new Board of Directors mem- bers. The following revisions in the Board of Directors structure and responsibilities have been made to bolster MUFON's public relations clout. Marge Christensen now has the responsibility for Director of Pub- lic Education and Information, a posi- tion in which she has performed admirably for the past 5 years. MUFON has reached the stature in UFOlogy where a spokesman and Director of Public Relations has become essential in order to dissemi- nate vital UFO information to the printed press and the electronic media. The MUFON Executive Com- mittee has approved the appointment of Robert H. Bletchman, presently State Director of Connecticut, to the position of Director of Public Rela- tions on the MUFON Board. An attorney with 20 years of experience in the UFO field, Mr. Bletchman is eminently qualified to execute this important function. As the greatest mystery of the 20th Century and the space age, the UFO phenomenon has not received the scientific recognition that it deserves in the press and elec- tronic media. Several UFO documen- taries are presently being produced for distribution to television networks and cable TV outlets. It is essential that the debunking press releases by a CSICOP spokesman concerning UFOs be repudiated with scientific MARGE CHRISTENSEN facts. With major UFO break- throughs on the immediate horizon, MUFON must be prepared to respond to the public in a professional, scien- tific and respected manner. *** Increased interest in the UFO phe- nomenon is readily apparent by the substantial number of new members joining each month. This is also reflected in the high caliber of people volunteering for leadership positions. Chuck Brooks, State Director for South Dakota, has appointed Tedra L. Plane as the Asst. State direc- tor. She is vitally interested in hypno- sis and counseling of abductees. Robert E. Lawler, M.D. of Cocoa, Florida has accepted the dual role of Consultant in Radiology and State Section Director for Brevard and Osceola Counties. Robert E. \"Chip\" Eggerton, Jr. living in New Orleans, is the new State Section Director for the Louisiana parishes of Orleans, St. Charles, St. Bernard, Jefferson, and Plaque Mines. \"Chip\" holds a Master of Divinity degree and an A.D. in Nursing. George A. Filer, a retired USAF Major and a MBA degree, volunteered as the State Section Director for Burlington and Ocean Counties in New Jersey. John S. Carpenter, M.S.W., residing in Springfield, Missouri, is the new State Section Director for Greene, Webster, Polk, and Christian Counties. He also serves as a Research Specialist in Clinical Hyp- nosis. Robert A. Liesser, M.S.L.S. of Tulsa, Oklahoma has joined MUFON in the capacity of Research Specialist in Library Science. Mr. Liesser worked with the late Robert Loftin, author of the book \"Identified Flying Saucers\". Other Research Specialists joining MUFON this past month were Gerald Mark Zeitlin, M.S.E.E. of Oakland, California for Electrical Engineering and Amateur Radio Operator N6DH; Rodney Jay Curd, M.S., of Lincoln, Nebraska in Psychology and Counseling; and John R.
