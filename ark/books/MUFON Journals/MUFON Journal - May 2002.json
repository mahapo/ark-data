Burleson, Ph.D. MUFON New Mexico State Director O ne of the most remarkable events in the history of UFO studies was what happened near Levelland, TX, on the night of Nov. 2-3, 1957. Assisted by my wife, fellow MUFON mem- ber Mollie Burleson, I undertook a three-day research trip in late March 2002 to Levelland, mainly due to my suspicion that there might well be something more to the Levelland flap than we knew about, something perhaps like physical trace evidence. Let me briefly review the ba- sic features of the case. Much . of what we have known here- tofore about this matter derives from early investigations done by NICAP and from the initial police reports themselves. Unfortunately, some of the primary witnesses,, notably Jim Wheeler and Frank Williams, were never really interviewed, and are now nowhere to be found; the details of their sightings are known only from their original reports to the police. These reports started coming in around 10:50 P.M. on Saturday, Nov. 2, 1957. A. J. Fowler (now deceased) received a call from a farm worker named Pedro Saucedo (also deceased), who, along with his friend Joe Salaz, had a frightful experience while driving on Route 116 (now 114) some four miles west of Levelland. It seems a large glowing object was down in a field just north of the road. Vehicle interference The object rose and passed over Saucedo's truck, caus- ing the motor and lights to die. Saucedo, badly shaken, got his truck started and drove on to the town of White- face to make his call to the Levelland authorities. Around midnight Jim Wheeler, driving on the same road about four miles east of Levelland, encountered a large oval object in the roadway. Wheeler's lights and engine died, but the lights came back on when the object lifted. At about the same time Jose Alvarez had a similar expe- rience on Route 51 (now 385) just below the town of Whitharral, northeast of Levelland. A few minutes later, Newell Wright had the same kind of sighting on Route 116 (114) several miles east of the Wheeler sighting; the object rose vertically off the road- way and darted northward at high velocity. In all cases witnesses described a large object (estimates of the width vary from 75 to 200 feet) and reported the now well- known, but until then virtually unknown, EM effect. A number of accounts describe the object as glowing blu- ish-green when on the ground and changing to bright red when lifting off. Around 12:15 A.M. Frank Williams had a similar en- counter a little south of Whitharral, just below the Alvarez site, a case of \"pulsating EM effect\" in that the large oval object's glow alternately brightened and dimmed, while his vehicle lights dimmed and brightened in contrast. But the night wasn't over. Around 12:45 Ronald Mar- tin saw an oval object land on Route 116 (114) several miles west of the Saucedo site, and half an hour later a truck driver named James Long encountered such an object on a farm road (now numbered 1490) north of Levelland. Also, sometime after 1:00, Fire Marshal Ray Jones saw a bright object in the air further north on 1490; his vehicle lights dimmed and his engines sputtered but didn't quite stall out. By 1:30 in the morning, Sheriff Weir Clem, mystified by all these crazy-sounding reports, took to the road him- self with his deputy Pat McCulloch, and they saw an ob- ject in the air near the James Long site on the farm road. (Unfortunately, like so many of the other players in this extraordinary drama, Sheriff Clem and Deputy McCulloch are no longer with us.) Around the same time constable Lloyd Bollen and two highway patrolmen saw an airborne object in the same area. I first began to suspect that there was more to the Levelland affair than previously understood when on an earlier trip through the city (Nov. 17,2001) I found a new witness, Allan Haney. Having gone to school with Weir Clem's daughter Sammie, having once interviewed Clem's son Mike, and having once spoken with Sheriff Clem him- self, Mr. Haney informed me that the sheriff and his deputy had themselves experienced the EM effect reported by the other witnesses, and that the mechanic who later checked the sheriff's then new 1957 Plymouth Fury was at a loss to explain why it should have stalled out. FBI tells Sheriff Clem not to talk? Mr. Haney told me, \"I asked Weir Clem what had hap- pened and he wouldn't tell me, except to say that the FBI had told him not to say anything about what he had seen.\" (This is the first time I had heard about the sheriff being officially admonished not to talk about the incident, but not the last time.) Mr. Haney also told me that he recalled, the day after the incident, or right around that time, that \"there were FBI or Air Force investigators all over the place in their black cars with the blackwall tires and radio antennas sticking out all over them. You can't bring a car like that into a small town without everyone knowing within a matter of minutes that something strange is going on.\" Mr. Haney also described a two-week series of May 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"sightings from the summer of 1957, a few weeks before the November events; he and his friends on several occasions climbed onto a roof to watch three or four objects hovering over Reese Air Force Base twenty-six miles to the east, near Lubbock. According to an Air Force insider whom Mr. Haney's father knew, the base tracked these objects on radar and even sent T-38 trainers to try to intercept them, but \"the objects would dart away at impossible angles and higher speeds than the T-38s could match.\" By this account, the road- way landings of November 1957 were hot the first Levelland experience with UFOs. But for me the important thing about the Haney testimony is that, in its description of an attempted \"muzzling\" of the sheriff, the account suggests a good deal more of- ficial angst over the whole matter than is readily explainable. Those familiar with the case will recall that the Air Force explanation ended up being \"ball lightning,\" so in view of the Haney account, we are left to wonder about the logic of officially telling a West Texas sheriff, in effect, \"Don't talk about all that lightning you people saw.\" On 25 March 2002, at the library on the campus of South Plains College in Levelland, I interviewed Carolyn Reno, who was in Levelland in 1957, and who turned out to be the first of two well-correlated physical-trace wit- nesses. Scorched prairie grass According to Ms . Reno's account, when she was around ten years old her father, Johnny Thompson (now deceased), took her to a place \"at the edge of town,\" a pasture where there were no houses or buildings nearby, and showed her a scorched spot in the prairie grass. She could not recall exactly where the site was. The scorched spot itself was roughly round and \"at least fifteen feet across.\" Ms. Reno pointed to the counter area at the front of the library and said that the spot was at least the size of the square counter, possibly a little larger; I later paced the counter off and estimated it to be about twenty-four feet long on each side. But it was Ms. Reno's father's remark to his daughter that was interesting, upon showing her the spot. He said, \"That was where it landed.\" Later the same day I spoke with Carolyn Reno's mother, Lorene Thompson, and while she had not gone to the site herself, she not only verified that Mr. Thompson had taken their young daughter to such a site, but also narrowed the location down to a place between Levelland and Lubbock, five or six miles out on Route 114, \"closer to Levelland than Lubbock.\" As we shall see, this description is important in terms of correlation with another witness account. I should men- tion that when we searched the newspaper files, kept on microfiche at the same college library where I interviewed Carolyn Reno, Mollie and I found that the Levelland Daily Don Burleson at the site oj the Pedro Saucedo sighting. ulo bv Mollie Biirli'Mini) Sun News for Sunday, Nov, 3, 1957, carried no news of UFO sightings, as no doubt the Sunday paper had been \"put to bed\" by Saturday evening-and that all issues be- tween Nov. 3 and Nov. 7 were missing. Starting with Nov. 7 the existing files showed no relevant news sto- ries. Also, the Hockley County News was missing from the files for the entire year of 1957. Mollie called Stephen Henry at the Levelland and Hockley County News Press, and he said that the rel- evant stories in the old Daily Sun News were cut out of the file copies by someone before they were microfiched. Mr. Henry was kind enough to supply me with photo- copies of an article that appeared in 1982 for the twenty- fifth anniversary of the sightings, and of a writeup done in 1999 by Antonio Rullan. The other trace-evidence witness I was referring to was Ginger (Clem) Sims, a daughter of Sheriff Weir Clem. (I was able to find her thanks to the assistance of Harley Reid and Laura Woolam at the Levelland Area Chamber of Commerce, who provided me with photo- copies of town records giving details of Sheriff Clem's family, including the married names of his daughters.) Ginger Sims graciously allowed me to interview her on March 25 and again on March 26, 2002, and spoke freely and fondly of her father. Weir Clem. She was only about four years old at the time of the events in question, and said that she was therefore somewhat un- certain as to exact dates and locations. Over the years she had become aware that someone like Sheriff Clem could come in for a lot of ridicule for talking about flying saucers, so she remembered her father usually being very careful about speaking of such things. Sheriff Clem \"opens up\" However, she said that as a child she had accompa- nied him one day to the coffee shop, and in the ensuing conversation there, Sheriff Clem for some reason de- cided to \"open up\" and talk about things to a group of men gathered in the shop. He described an incident in Page 4 MUFON UFO Journal May 2002"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"which he and a deputy named Chicho Barra were corning back from a ball game and got a call from a Mrs. Redd, on a ranch near the community of Sundown, southwest of Levelland. Mrs. Redd had reported seeing strange ob- jects in the air near her ranch on earlier occasions, and Sheriff Clem had been called out there more than once. On this occasion on his way to the ranch he saw a cigar-shaped object with lights, and his car engine died. He got out of the car and watched for three or four min- utes as the object hovered near the ground and then shot off into the distance, at which time the car lights came back on. When the sheriff got home he reported the inci- dent and called Reese Air Force Base (now closed). Of- ficials at the base told him, \"Don't say anything about any of this. You've seen nothing, heard nothing.\" On another occasion, his daughter told me, Sheriff Clem went out in his car and saw an object that \"he couldn't get close to.\" (This sounds like the 2-3 November event.) This story, too, Ginger Sims heard over coffee in the shop where the sheriff talked to his acquaintances. The sight- ing was sometime after midnight, and the advice to the sheriff from the Air Force was: \"Drop it.\" Ms. Sims re- members her father saying that there were government people in town soon after the sightings (this correlates well with Allan Haney's account). I had mentioned to her that Mollie and I had driven to Levelland from Roswell that morning, and remarkably enough Ms. Sims said in referring to the Air Force people who talked to her father, \"I think some of them might have been from Roswell.\" (Should that turn out to be the case, needless to say it would have intriguing implications.) In any case they again told him, \"You haven't seen anything.\" She further related to me an account of Sheriff Clem being called out to the Spade Ranch, toward Lubbock, to see a burned spot there, a large ring scorched into the ground but not burned in the middle. (Carolyn Reno de- scribed her own scorched spot as a solid circle. It's pos- sible of course that there may have been more than one.) Dead cattle reported The sheriff had mentioned that there were some dead cattle reported in connection with this event as well, and that was the primary reason why he was called out. The location having been the Spade Ranch is significant here, as it correlates closely with the description of Carolyn Reno and her mother, to the effect that there was a charred spot somewhere five or six miles east of Levelland off Route 114, which indeed is where the Spade Ranch is. Thus we have both a primary trace-evidence witness (Carolyn Reno) and a secondary witness (Ginger Sims) whose accounts are consistent. Given the uncertainty of the dates involved, it could be argued of course that the sheriff being called out to see a burn-ring was an event separate from, possibly unrelated to, the reported landings of 2-3 November. But it should be kept in mind that Carolyn Reno's father said to her, \"That was where it landed.\" This \"it\" to which he re- ferred would logically appear to have been a reported and talked-about object, since he didn't just say, more generi- cally, \"That was where something landed.\" (When I men- Sliertff Weir Clem tioned, at the very end of the second interview in order not to have prejudiced the current witness account, that another witness had once seen a burned spot and had been told, \"That was where it landed,\" Ginger Sims re- sponded, \"That's what Daddy always said.\") Thus we could frame a reasonable hypothesis, or at least not unreasonable-mat Sheriff Clem's bum-ring was related to the events of Nov. 2-3. And in this scenario, the existence of physical trace evidence could help to explain how anxiously the official powers tried to see to it that the Levelland sightings were explained away and then forgotten, especially if the causes of the reported burn-ring may possibly also have been related to cattle deaths, and if a num- ber of townspeople knew this. What's more, Ginger Sims told me that her fa- ther, Sheriff Clem, though normally a man not afraid of anything, was disturbed and frightened by what he saw. \"My father,\" she said, \"had no fear. But when he spoke of this, there was fear.\" She said that he was \"gentle as a lamb, but you didn't want to mess with him,\" and said that ordinarily nothing would scare him. But: \"You could see the fear in his eyes when he spoke of it.\" This image, of a rough-and-tough West Texas sheriff seeing something truly frightful in the air, something that continued to haunt him, makes the official explanations (ball lightning, wet ignition systems, storm-induced hys- teria when there was no storm) truly preposterous. That the sheriff had an uncommon experience appears to be well remembered by older townspeople, even though to the younger generations the Levelland events are largely unknown. A number of people whom I inter- viewed brought up the EM effect, without calling it that, and without my mentioning it beforehand. Even Mickey Palmer, the proprietor of the Levelland Motel where we stayed, mentioned (March 25,2002) having had an uncle who remembered Weir Clem's talking about how his car engine had died. A man named Dick Tubb, whom we met at a restau- rant, said (March 26, 2002) that he had known people to whom the sheriff had described the classic dying engine and fading headlights to the effect that Clem, seeing a large glowing object in the air, was unable to get close to it (a correlation with the Ginger Sims account) because his car would stall out. Verification On March 27, 2002 I also spoke with a real estate man named Sam Langford, who had known Weir Clem, mentioning that the sheriff had chased the mysterious object \"up and down the road a bit,\" but his car died May 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"when he got closer. Mr. Langford turned out to function as a character witness, as he remarked, \"Weir was a good, solid man,\" and said that he had great respect for the sheriff's veracity in spite of all the ridicule that people indulged in when the topic turned to flying saucers. \"I really believe he saw something,\" Mr. Langford said. All in all,.what emerges here is a picture of key wit- ness Sheriff Clem as a truthful and trustworthy man well known and respected in his community, a man having had a haunting experience with the unknown, a man having been enjoined by governmental forces to keep silent. Where these new witness accounts speak of the pres- ence of government types in Levelland soon after the sightings, they may appear to be at odds with earlier nar- ratives, but 1 would say that such is not really the case. A feeble investigation For example, Dr. Kevin Randle in Scientific Ufology describes the visit to Levelland by an Air Force \"investi- gator\" identified as SSgt. Norman P. Earth of the 1006 Ih Air Intelligence Service Squadron. While Earth cursorily interviewed a few witnesses (including Pedro Saucedo, Sheriff Clem, and Deputy Pat McCulloch), he spent only a short time in town, leaving the press to wonder out loud about this \"mystery man\" and.his \"feeble parody of an investigation.\"   . In contrast to this single-investigator scenario, a num- ber of my new witness accounts describe larger numbers of government types prowling the city, though again I feel there is no real inconsistency here. As Kevin points out, a local news story did at one point refer to \"investigators\" in the plural. Anyway, not only was the Earth inquiry merely a to- ken investigation, but it seems clear that the purpose of the other governmental visits to Levelland was not to in- vestigate at all, but rather to encourage witnesses to for- get the whole thing and keep quiet. Visitors with such an agenda would probably not make themselves any more conspicuous than necessary, though as Allan Haney points out, such people tend to stick out on the streets of a small town. Besides collecting new witness testimony illuminating such matters as these, the other purpose for my recent research trip was to clarify map locations relating to the UFO touchdown events reported in 1957. There was a rough map of the landing sites in NICAP's The UFO Evidence, edited by Richard Hall (along with a basic writeup of the Levelland sightings originally compiled by NICAP advisor Walter N. Webb), but while the map was helpful, it contained no identification of the roads involved. I have been able to identify these roads, thus pinning down more specific locations for the landing sites themselves relative to road names and numbers (see map on cover). The primary reference is Route 114, running east-west along the northern edge of the city. From its intersection with 114, Route 385 runs north and then northeast to the three-way intersection at which Frank Williams had his sighting, the pulsating-EM landing event. Here Route 385 turns north again and leads to the community of Whitharral. The road leading west from the Frank Will- Molly Burleson at the Jim Wheeler report site. (Photo b\\ Don Burleson) iams intersection is called Monaco, and the road leading south from there is called only \"County Road\" on Hockley County maps, though if one follows it south all the way back down to 114 it is marked there by a street sign as Kauffman Street, and this intersection at 114 is roughly the site of the Jim Wheeler report. What early accounts identified as the Oklahoma Flats Road is Farm Road 1490. northwest of town. A few miles north from 114 up this road is the place where Weir Clem saw the UFO in the air. To verify the location of the Pedro Saucedo report (as there are many roads branch- ing off 114) Mollie and I drove the zigzag path starting north on 1490, past the Weir Clem and James Long sites, then west on Farm Road 2306 with a \"zig\" south and a \"zag\" west, then back south to 114. where the southward road is marked at the intersection as Five Mile Road. (It is in fact 5.3 miles west of the city limit sign on 114.) This identifies the Pedro Saucedo site as the intersec- tion of 114 and Five Mile Road, and the place where he saw the object on the ground would be roughly the open field area on the northeast side of that intersection. Fur- ther west on 114. going toward Whiteface (where Saucedo called in his report) one sees Route 303 leading off to the north to the farm community of Pettit, where two com- bines were said to have shut down when an object flew over them in 1957 as originally reported by NICAP mem- ber James Lee. I should mention that while the 1957 touchdowns may well not even have irradiated the sites, and while in any case it would be highly improbable that any such effects would have endured after forty-five years, as a matter of routine I checked the Frank Williams, Jim Wheeler, and Pedro Saucedo sites with a geiger counter, but (not sur- prisingly) found only normal background radiation. Altogether the Levelland case is an exceedingly strik- ing one, with its multiple witness accounts and its well- attested roadway landings-as many as seven landings within a twenty-mile radius in the interval of two and a half hours. Now it appears that there may well have been physical trace evidence as well, and. accordingly, a good deal of official anxiousness to keep the matter quiet. But obviously it should be kept anything but quiet. Page 6 MUFON UFO Journal May 2002"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Characteristic light pattern observed Giant triangle 'covers' Idaho hunters Four hunters were camped at a remote site in central Idaho on the night of Sept. 27,2000, when one of the men went outside their camper to get some food from the back of his pickup. The time was approximately 9:45 p.m. He sensed that something was not quite normal, \"like a thick blanket suspended overhead.\" . The men had been in camp for about a week, and were in an area where they had hunted annually for more than 20 years^ so they were very familiar with the surround- ings, even though they were from out of state. As the hunter stepped up on the rear tire of his truck to reach into the bed, his flashlight swept across the clear night sky above him, illuminating something very large, directly overhead. He was so startled by what he saw that he fell to his knees from shock. ; He was looking at the bottom of a huge, silent, un- lighted triangular-shaped object that was sitting motion- less in the sky directly above the camping area. His initial impression was that the object was at least the size of a football field, hundreds of feet on a side. It had rounded corners, and its skin, where his flash- light had swept over one corner of the bizarre object, ex- hibited distinct texture. It was so large that it seemed to blot out the sky above him. The witness, 43 years of age, started yelling almost hysterically for the others to come outside immediately. The men in the camper were so alarmed by the tone of their friend's voice that they rushed for the camper door, expecting to see a bear attacking their mules or some other \"normal\" event taking place outside. They were not prepared for what they saw. Two of them were able to get outside in time to wit- ness the object overhead slowly and silently begin to move away from their campground toward a nearby mountain. Even before they had managed to get out the door, how- ever, the object had begun to generate a distinct whining sound, at which time lights suddenly appeared on the ven- tral surface. A large, round, subdued, white light was now plainly visible in each of the three corners of the triangle, and a prominent red, strobing light was visible in the middle of the ventral surface-a lighting pattern frequently reported where triangle-shaped objects are seen. The two witnesses who had rushed outside quickly grabbed high-quality binoculars and were able to focus on the object long enough to be able to observe it for approximately 45-50 seconds. The object proceeded to ascend and maneuver up a narrow canyon in the side of the nearby mountain. The men described its motion through the sky as being \"like a hockey puck gliding over ice\"-very smooth and unwavering. One of the three men has been a private pilot for more than two decades, and he felt certain that it was not moving through the atmosphere the way on aero- dynamic body would. The men were stunned by the sight- ing. After they had discussed the event for several hours, two of the party felt so threatened by the experience that they decided to leave the area, drive for several hours to the nearest major town, and spend the night at a motel. One of the two, the first to witness the object, spent a very uncomfortable night, lying awake and thinking about the object he had witnessed hours earlier. He felt keenly \"on edge,\" and startled dramatically on one occasion when the electric heater in their motel room suddenly came on. The next morning, they contacted local government offices to report the incident, providing them with details, including the co-ordinates of their sighting. Then they con- tacted the National UFO Reporting Center, which took a report from them over the telephone and requested a follow-up written report. After reporting the incident, they returned to the site and remained there for several more days before driving back to their homes. Interestingly, the two men who re- mained at the camp the night of the sighting witnessed military jet fighters fly down the valley the object had flown up the night before, and pass directly over their camp. They reported that the jets were rocking their wings dramatically as they descended down the valley toward their camp. 'Gathering camp-out' set near Area 51 over Memorial Day Ike Bishop, State Director for Idaho, is putting together a \"gathering camp-out\" at Rachel, NV, over the Memo- rial Day weekend. There will be an open bar Welcome Reception at the famous Little A'le'inn on Friday evening May 24. The entire event will cost $100 per person, and includes camp space, breakfast buffet Saturday and Sunday mornings at the inn, a trip to Tempiute Mine, speakers Saturday and Sunday, a sack lunch both Saturday and Sunday, side trips to the Area 51 Boundary, and a trip to Tikaboo peak for a climb and a look into the famous Groom Lake Base (Area 51). There will be other side trips available, according to Bishop, and sky watches at the famous Mail Box Road where there have been numerous sightings. \"It will be a fun, action packed weekend!\" says Bishop. \"I can't wait to share this exciting adventure with my friends.

In Part 2 he continues these comparisons. The Malleus Maleficarum has much to say on the subject of procreation between demons and humans. In fact, after a discussion about what is done and how, their conclusions are startlingly similar to those'of any abductionist today. As far as scholars such as David Jacobs are concerned, there are several ways in which the aliens may intervene or manipulate: * A normal human couple may be watched by Grays during lovemaking in their room and feel compelled to carry on regardless. * Two normal humans, possibly strangers, may be forced to have sex aboard an alien craft. * Aliens collect semen from men by natural and arti- ficial means, and eggs from women artificially. * An alien or \"hybrid\" may have, .sexual intercourse with an abductee. In this case, either the abductee is de- ceived into believing she is with a loved one, or is raped. . The Malleus, which was written, we must not forget, five hundred and six years before Jacobs' first study was published, mentions the following kinds of sexual inter- course between demons and humans: * A demon may have sexual intercourse with a hu- man being, either by adopting an illusory form (such as a husband or a seductive stranger) or in their own form. 4 Demons collect semen from men to inject it later into the bodies of women. * Demons could prevent a normal human couple from procreating by intervening in their own room to bring about impotence. Adopting human likeness How could demons rape, seduce, impregnate, or even : copulate if they did not have physical bodies? This is not a doubt confined to Medieval theologians. Abductee \"Eva\" expressed her feelings about this to John Mack: \"Here's an energy, a formless energy, and it's somehow sending this telepathic message that it's going to impregnate me.\" How, she wondered, \"is some formless consciousness going to impregnate me, the fact being that I have a body?\" Eva's conclusion was that \"it was trying to maybe meet me in my territory by putting on a human form, hoping that that would make me feel more comfortable and would subside the terror of that communion.\" Most of Part II, Question I, Chapter 4 of the Malleus Maleficarum is devoted to this problem. Indeed, the chap- ter is called \"Here follows the Way whereby Witches copulate with those Devils known as Incubi.\" The au- thors eventually come to the conclusion that, though the devil assumes an \"aerial body,\" this air \"is in some re- spects terrestrial, in so far as it has an earthly property through condensation.\" Thus demons raise \"gross vapours\" from the earth \"and by collecting them together into shapes in which they abide\" they are able to attain \"the formal appearance of life.\" Semen collection The Malleus Malefi- carum goes into considerable detail about how semen was collected by the demons. It was a great worry to them that the beings interfered with matters of human reproduc- tion \"by obtaining human se- men, and themselves transfer- ring it.\" The basic belief at the time was that demons were unable to reproduce themselves because they do not pos- sess \"physical organs which have bodily life,\" that is, they lack a soul and the necessary organic parts to procreate as a species. . However, with their powers and their \"age-long expe- rience\" the devils could manipulate man's \"privy parts and navel\" for their own ends, enabling them to interfere with the reproductive process as much as they wanted to. Sperm-collection procedures are an important part of alien abductions. \"For men, the expression of sperm is a central aspect of the abduction experience.\" There seem to be three ways in which this is achieved: * sexual intercourse with an alien being (for example, in the Villas Boas case); * extraction via a tube connected to a machine; 4 through an \"envisioning\" technique (the projection of a false image), leading the abductee to believe that he is having sex with a human woman. The \"woman\" either turns out to be a machine or an alien. In demonic rape, men either knowingly had sex with a female demon (succubus) or were deceived into thinking that these were human women. This was achieved by demons using their magic powers, with which they could \"change the perceptions and befoul the emotions of men.\" No machines are mentioned, but this is what we would expect in medieval times. Indeed, what we know of the technology employed by the aliens today comes to us through the use of hypnosis-something which did not ex- ist five centuries ago. After studying dozens of cases and consulting the works Page8 MUFON UFO Journal May 2002"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"of other scholars dealing with the subject, Sprenger and Kramer arrived at their own conclusions about the pur- pose and mechanism of human-demon procreation. Firstly, they reiterated the fact that devils have no way of pro- creating without human intervention. A devil has no se- men of its own: \"And the semen does not so much spring from him, as it is another man's semen received by him for this purpose.\" How is the semen stored? Secondly, the devils extract men's semen in the ways stated above and store it. Kramer and Sprenger were aware that some might wonder how this was possible: \"...it may be argued that semen has no power of genera- tion except as long as the heat of life is retained in it, and that this must be lost when it is carried great distances. The answer is that devils are able to store the semen safely, so that its vital heat is not lost; or even that it can- riot evaporate so easily on account of the great speed at which they move by reason of the superiority of the mover over the thing moved.\" Once the semen has been stored thus, the time comes to \"transfer the semen which they have collected and inject it into the bodies of others.\" This they may do in three ways, according to the Malleus Maleficarum: 4 by adopting the form of an incubus and feigning copulation with a human woman; 4 by penetrating in this way but invisibly; * by an alternative method not involving copulation. The third of these methods is not described in detail. Sprenger and Kramer are reluctant to accept it, but they admit that other theologians and demonologists regard it as a fact. \"And the conclusion,\" they write, \"is that devils, even without assuming bodies, can work transmutations in semen.\" One way or another, witches were said to be impreg- nated with what was originally sperm extracted from a human male not known to her personally. Five hundred years later, abductionists have come to the same conclu- sions about abductees. Firstly, eggs and sperm are taken from human subjects. The former are fertilized with the latter, the fertilized egg is then implanted into the uterus and the female abductee becomes, technically speaking, pregnant. \"Through such action,\" says the Malleus Maleficarum, \"complete conception and generation by women can take place, inasmuch as they can deposit hu- man semen in the suitable place of a woman's womb where there is already a corresponding substance.\" An important point to note is that abductionists claim the fer- tilized egg is genetically altered before it is implanted in the uterus. Naturally, nobody could have speculated about this possibility in the fifteenth century. They did seem to be aware that the offspring born from demonic rape were not wholly normal, as we will see below. Pregnancy In alien abduction, the hybrid fetus is thought to be removed from its human mother after a few weeks. The Malleus Maleficarum neither denies nor implies that this was the case centuries ago, remaining mute on the sub- ject of what happens after the conception. This is com- prehensible, as our knowledge of where the fetus is taken comes from hypnotic probing performed long after the event. The only clue that an abduction researcher usually has to go on is the abductee's memory of experiencing all the typical symptoms of pregnancy only to wake up one day to find that she is no longer pregnant. There are sev- eral references in the Malleus Maleficarum to infertility and sudden, seemingly unnatural abortions, supposedly provoked by demons or witches. Whether or not this amounts to the same thing, it does indicate that, like aliens, the work of devils often had to do with an interruption of the natural birth process. It is in- teresting that John Mack makes an allusion to exactly this issue while discussing the experiences of abductee Ed and his wife Lynn: :There have been a number of fertility problems, which may or may not be abduction-related, including three or four spontaneous terminations of Lynn's pregnancies.\" The Malleus Maleficarum refers to \"disappearing pregnancies\" when it says, \"At times also women think they have been made pregnant by an incubus, and their bellies grow to an enormous size; but when the time of partition comes, their swelling is relieved by no more than the expulsion of a great quantity of wind...And it is very easy for the devil to cause these and even greater disor- ders in the stomach.\" Nevertheless, the Inquisitors were aware that other pregnancies definitely were caused by the physical \"seed- ing\" of Incubi, and that they had to take care in order to distinguish real cases from false ones. \"Too easy cre- dence,\" they said, \"should not be given to women, but only to those whom experience has shown to be trust- worthy, and to those who, by sleeping in their beds or near by them, know for a fact.that such things as we have spoken of are true.\" The Malleus Maleficarum also states that \"a married witch who has been impregnated by her husband\" is also at risk because \"the devil can, by the commixture of an- other semen, infect what which has been conceived.\" This points to a logical extension of the \"breeding project\" theory that abductionists have rarely proposed. Strange offspring There were two kinds of children born from human- demon procreation: changelings, who had everything in common with the \"hybrid\" creatures allegedly produced by abduction activities today, and normal-looking babies indistinguishable from other human beings. As far as the normal-looking ones were concerned, Sprenger and Kramer acknowledged that these were more likely to receive visits from devils during their lives than the average Christian. Those children \"whom they beget have the best sort of disposition for devil's work.\" However, they were also quick to point out that \"Incu- bus Devils do not infest only those women who have been begotten by their filthy deeds or those who have been offered to them by midwives, but all indifferently with greater or less venereal delectation.\" The changelings, on the other hand, were physically May 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"different from humans. Basically, they were ugly, pee- vish, and frequently highly intelligent. They were identical to the changelings found in fairy tradition, which is evi- dently where the concept was borrowed from. There were two main types of changelings in Medieval demonology. One was the species created by incubi from semen taken from men and incubated in women. The other was when the devils themselves appeared in the guise of in- fants to \"attach themselves to the nurses.\" Both kinds \"are always ailing and do not grow, and cannot receive enough milk to satisfy them, and are often reported to have vanished away.\" In Part II, Question I, Chapter 13 of the Malleus Maleficarum we read that babies will turn out to be pow- erful witches if they are dedicated to the cause \"from, their very cradles.\" It is at this point that Sprenger and Kramer explain their understanding of multi-generational contact with devils. The \"whole of a witch's progeny is infected,\" they declare. This is how the witchcraft tradition survives for centu- ries, passed on from mother to child. \"For how else could it happen, as it has very often been found, that tendergirls of eight or ten years have raised up tempests and hail- storms, unless they had been dedicated to the devil under such a pact by their mothers.\" The authors touch on a phenomenon well-attested in UFO lore, that of the so-called wise children. Generally, at least since the beginning of modern investigations, abductees only see such children in \"dreams.\" Instinc- tively they know the dream is also a reality, and that the child is theirs. Randies (1988) and Hopkins (1987) go into this topic at length. Strieber also hints that his young son, also allegedly an abdqctee, is innately \"wise\" but does not propose a theory to explain it. The age of the abductees Sprenger and Kramer reveal that demons would first contact humans at a very early age, a few months after birth in some cases, and that such contact could continue until old age. Demonological treatises constantly mention cases of young and elderly women maintaining sexual relations with devils and even becoming pregnant by them: Jacobs does not differ in his opinion. In fact; in his 1998 study, The Threat, he goes into great detail about the way in which postmenopausal women can be used in the breeding program. Theoretically, age is no obstacle, and none of the \"old crones\" referred to in the Malleus Maleficarum and else- where would have been exempt from accusations of deal- ing with demons. Jacobs concludes, \"We now know that abductions begin in infancy...We also now know that the abduction phenomenon continues into old age.\" The role of women Sprenger arid Kramer dwelt long on the question of who were most likely to be \"seduced\" by the beings and why. They came to the conclusion that women were usu- ally taken more often than men, and that their relationship with the demons tended to be deeper: The friars speak mainly of female witches throughout their treatise, ex- plaining that it is more correct to use the feminine term than a generic masculine one (warlocks, for example) because, simply, they came across more cases of be- witched women than men, despite their acknowledgement that both sexes were Vulnerable. Is it mere coincidence that David Jacobs writes the following in a note at the beginning of his Secret Life! \"Because the majority of abductees in this study are women, and because women seem to have a larger num- ber of more complex experiences, I have adopted the stylistic device of using the pronoun 'she' throughout the abduction event, except, of course, when discussing spe- cific male experiences.\" We can be sure that Dr. Jacobs was not being preju- diced against women in his book, merely honest. And we know for a fact that the authors of the Malleus Maleficarum were highly sexist! Yet it is curious that Jacobs would come upon the same anomaly as Sprenger and Kramer in their book. A brief scan of other landmark abduction studies-the books of Budd Hopkins, for example-suggests a pattern. Mack writes that of the 76 individuals who he consid- ers fit his \"strict criteria for an abduction case,\" forty- seven are females and twenty-nine males. Not knowing how many cases of abduction exist in the world today, it is not possible for anyone to say whether there are more female abductees than male ones, but there is at least an apparent imbalance. The goddess Leaving aside the issue of whether women are more likely to be abductees than men, it is nevertheless inter- esting to note that the authors of the Malleus Maleficarum refer to the witch-queen Diana or Herodias in the first question of the first part of the book. It is with Diana that \"during the night they [the witches] ride abroad,\" they point out. Diana was an ancient Italian deity identified with Artemis, and commonly regarded as a moon-goddess. She was also associated with fertility: However, there is very little evidence that the witches ever worshipped her at all. Much of what is commonly believed about witchcraft and the \"witch-goddess\" comes from a series of books published in the twentieth century. The Witch-Cult in Western Europe (1921) was an attempt by British author Margaret Murray to explain the presence of witches in Europe by suggesting that they were the remnants of a pagan cult devoted to the Mother Goddess. This theory has had many detractors, however, and nowadays it is very difficult to believe that such a religion ever existed. There is simply no evidence for it. : An outcome of Murray's books was the popularisation of pseudo-Pagan religions. \"Wicca\" cults emerged in vari- ous parts of the world, many in imitation of the religion which Murray hypothesized. Some of these have become officially recognized, especially in the United States; where Wicca ministers can perform marriages and carry out other priestly functions. One of Wicca's most renowned supporters is Whitley Strieber. His first two abduction-related books go into detail about certain experiences of his that indicate, for him, the Page 10 MUFON UFO Journal May 2002"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"involvement of a Mother or Fertility Goddess in UFO en- counters. Another famed abductee, Betty Andreasson Luca, also made remarks which seem to allude to a fe- male presence behind the abduction phenomenon. This occurred during a hypnosis session in which Betty sud- denly began to speak in a strange language that was later identified as Gaelic. Translated, the first lines can be in- terpreted as meaning \"Children of the northern people, you wander in impenetrable darkness. Your mother mourns.\" Strieber wrote the foreword to Raymond Fowler's 1990 book The Watchers. In it he refers to Betty's and his own experiences: \"My own experience, as I have mentioned in both Communion and Transformation, seems to in- volve an immensely powerful female figure. Certainly it is full of symbolic imagery that relates to ancient feminine deities and feminine mythology. And here, hidden in Betty's recollections, is another mysterious reference to a pow- erful female presence...\" No matter what we think of Strieber's beliefs and Betty Andreasson Luca's testimony, this recent emphasis on the involvement of a Mother Goddess in alien abduction brings the subject even closer to the theories outlined in the Malleus Maleficarum. Invasive surgical operations It is irrelevant whether the Medieval scribes repro- duced garbled accounts of actual events, or whether most of their tales were invented by over-fertile paranoid imagi- nations, but what is certain is that among the strange ex- periences and encounters they compiled are descriptions of surgical operations carried out by supernatural entities. (Not demons this time, but angels.) The purpose, or at least the result, of these operations is, in each case, to rid a man of his sexual urges. The first incident of this kind mentioned by Sprenger and Kramer is one described by the ascetic writer John Cassian, of Southern Gaul (c.360-c.435 AD), as having happened to the Abbot Serenus. According to Cassian, \"An Angel of the Lord came to him in a vision in the night, and seemed to open his belly and take from his entrails a burning tumor of flesh, and then to replace all his intestines as they had been...\" In this way, Serenus' body was rendered as pure as his heart, and he would have no sexual urge again during the rest of his life. In Lives of the Fathers by Saint Heraclides, it is said that a monk named Helias was also frustrated by his unpious sexual desires until the day he was visited by three Angels in a dream. They set about making him a eunuch in this way: \"...one seemed to hold his hands, an- other his feet, and the third to cut out his testicles with a knife; though this was not really so, but only seemed to be.\" The monk did not feel another \"spark of temptation\" in the remaining forty years of his life. If not garbled accounts of real surgical interventions, these operations must have been purely metaphorical. That is to say, an operation would seem to take place but no wound would be inflicted and nothing would be extracted from the body. The effect would be placebo, as the de- scription in the Malleus Maleficarum suggests. May 2002 Abductee Karin was put through a similar ordeal dur- ing one of her abduction experiences. On page 142 of John Mack's groundbreaking Passport to the Cosmos we read: \"They opened up my chest and took out my heart.\" She protested violently that that does not happen. \"You don't take out somebody's heart.\" The operation was not real, it was an illusion, \"holo- graphic, perhaps.\" It was also metaphorical, as Mack explains: \"By this time Karin had done a good deal of self-educating about hearts, metaphors, symbols, and so on, and she suggested to us that this was all a metaphor, 'an archetype for all that is love and all things that are life.'\" Collecting seeds For two decades the only close encounter reports not regarded as being too outlandish were those in which alien beings were observed to be gathering rocks and plants in the fields, or seemingly inpecting the terrain. Witnesses often arrived on the spot and watched the aliens at work. Typically the aliens would detect the human presence in a matter of seconds or minutes and hurry back into their craft and leave. These cases include the Maurice Masse case in 1965 in which the bald, white-skinned dwarves paralyzed the French farmer in his lavender field when he found them bending over one of his lavender bushes, and scores of lesser-known incidents such as one that occurred in 1954 in Pontal, Brazil, in which little men were seen gathering water and vegetables near a river bank before re-enter- ing their craft. For many years there was a lot of speculation about what the aliens were looking for and what exactly they did with the items they took with them. Researchers still wonder, but nowadays abduction reports have superseded simple \"landings\" as the main subject of inquiry, and the latter are being largely ignored. There is an overlap, however. Many abductees claim to have seen, aboard alien vehicles, beautiful gardens and forests teeming with wildlife apparently taken from the earth. Such is the case of Betty Andreasson Luca (she enters \"a huge vivarium, an enclosure for keeping or rais- ing plants or animals indoors\"), Catherine (although there was \"forest all around\" she \"could still see the curving walls of the ship\"), and Denise and Bert Twigg (\"The vegetation on the mother ship for the most part seems much like the forests of evergreens here on Earth;..\"), to name but a few. The Malleus Maleficarum makes it clear that demons make trips over the earth in order to gather seeds. Refer- ring to the writings of Strabo, it is affirmed \"that devils hurry up and down over the whole earth...and these dev- ils are able to collect various germs or seeds, and from these germs or seeds they are able to cause various spe- cies to grow.\" Later it is written that devils, by \"collecting every sort of seed\" can \"by working upon them broad- cast various species.\" There is a strong ecological bent in modern reports of this kind. At the conference held at the M.I.T. in 1992, abductee Sue said that during one of her experiences she had been shown an artificial environment under glass MUFON UFO Journal Page 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"domes containing plants, animals, and people. \"I was then brought down into a large cavern where I was shown and encouraged to handle different kinds of seeds,\" she added. The beings were apparently trying to heighten her eco- logical awareness. Devils and dreaming One of the many theories expounded in the Malleus Maleficarum to explain what went on in encounter or abduction cases was connected with \"inner sensory per- ceptions.\" This is the most \"modern\" of all the theories developed by medieval researchers to try to comprehend the seemingly impossible things reported by both witches and non-witches. The gist of the idea was that at night everybody dreams, and that some dreams are so powerful that it appears to the dreamer that his room has been invaded by \"appari- tions.\" Such apparitions, it was suggested, are fancies that come from \"the treasury of ideas received through the senses\" which \"remain in the mind or inner percep- tion.\" Devils, then, were thought to \"stir up and excite\" the minds of humans and thus create illusions \"so that such men imagine these things to be true.\" This theory-that witnesses see supernatural objects or entities extracted from their own dreams, imaginations, and recall-is a popu- lar one in ufology among skeptics and \"believers\" alike. On the one hand, the \"believers\" propose that the phe- nomenon, though physically real, often manifests itself in forms designed to appeal to the belief-system of the viewer. This would explain why witches often encoun- tered horned goat-like entities brandishing staffs, and to- day people generally see science-fiction monsters. Somehow the phenomenon (aliens, energies, spirits or whatever it is) knows what we expect or desire to see (angels, sprites or almond-eyed insectoids) and adapts to it. Sceptics, on the other hand, point out that if UFO end- WUFOD login & password for MUFON members WUFOD is MUFON's Worldwide UFO database, linked to the MUFON home page.

They also regard prewaking (hypnogogic) and presleeping (hypnopompic) states as likely triggers of vivid \"dreams that seem indistinguishable from reality. There are some very good reasons to take'these theo- ries seriously, and some equally strong ones to doubt them. As far as anomalous experiences are concerned, our knowledge has not come all that far since the same is- sues were debated by Medieval scholars. We have seen a number of parallels between a study of personal encounters with supernatural beings written in 1486 and the theories and investigations of twentieth- century ufologists. The correlations between the two are deep enough to demand serious consideration by modern researchers, especially those whose personal Malleus Maleficarum happens to be David Jacobs' Secret Life.

In different ways. Dr. Brenda Denzler and Dr. Jim Deardorff (Deardorff and I have corresponded in the past) ask the question when I talk about the \"God Hypothesis,\" what kind of God am I talking about-a big, big God, or a sort of medium sized God or gods-pretty smart aliens-gods, but not the big God that created the universe? My answer is. [ do not know yet. What I do know is that just as there is huge resistance in our culture, espe- cially among the power elite, to admit UFOs are real, there is also an equal resistance among those who take UFOs seriously to admitting that the religious dimension of UFOs needs to be part of the scientific quest. Few UFO researchers have done more in the field than Jerome Clark with his wide ranging and encyclope- dic work. Yet he says. \"It is entirely likely, in my opinion, that daylight disks tracked on radar and exotic entity en- counters experienced by individuals are two entirely sepa- rate, unrelated classes of phenomena.\" (Ron Story's En- cyclopedia of Extraterrestrial Encounters, p. 130.) I suppose this could be true. But taking Clark's opinion to its logical limit, people like Budd Hopkins, John Mack, Ann Druffel, and David Jacobs are not doing UFO re- search. If you are going to admit that \"daylight disks\" are real, and probably extraterrestrial, as Clark does, but not admit that UFOs may abduct humans from their bedrooms, sometimes with independent witnesses who see the body come out of a building, and being taken into a UFO, as Budd Hopkins reports in his 1996 book Witnessed, what kind of scientific method is this? What is obvious is that this method excludes the study of the most important part of the UFO phenomenon-the aliens themselves-as legitimate science, and, of course, perhaps conveniently, it excludes the religious dimension from UFO study. What kind of science says, \"I believe airplanes are real, and fly in our skies, but I do not believe they have pilots, or that they land and take on passen- gers?\" What may be true of Clark and many other UFO re- searchers is that they are willing to admit that UFOs are some form of advanced technology which is beyond our ability to understand, but cannot admit that the aliens in the UFOs have a psychic/spiritual nature which is also beyond our ability to understand. It is of course in the psychic/spiritual nature of the aliens that the deepest reli- gious questions lie, and why I said in \"Wormholes. Heaven, and the God Hypothesis\" that exploring the mind/spirit of the aliens is the most important challenge we face-the technology of UFOs has to be secondary to the nature of the aliens themselves. It seems to me the rather unscientific methodology of those like Clark which maintains the religious/psychic di- mension of UFOs as a taboo keeps us from exploring the historical and religious implications of UFOs with the se- riousness they deserve. I use the term \"The God Hypoth- esis\" partly to overcome this taboo, but I also use the term in a descriptive sense, and with the possibility of a philosophical sense. 1) In a descriptive sense, the aliens seem god-like. Budd Hopkins finds it anndying-insulting-that the aliens treat us like laboratory animals. In other words, the aliens assume a god-like power over us. The aliens not only assume they have the right to exercise lordship over our bodies, but evidence from researchers such as Hopkins and Mack make it clear the aliens feel they have the right, along with the power, to invade and control our minds. We have stories that aliens have changed the computer codes in our missiles, they feel free to knock out the tech- nology in our jets, and they fly circles around our technol- ogy. The Semitic word for power is -el, and from this word comes both the Hebrew word for God, elohi, and the Muslim word for God, Allah. The most basic idea about God in the Western world is that God is intelligent power. And in the Hebrew, Christian, and Muslim religions, God and his angels come from somewhere up in the sky. God is an intelligent extraterrestrial power. In their letters, both Dr. Denzler and Dr. Deardorff suggest it is a mistake to say it was the real \"Big God\" of the universe who met Moses at Mt. Sinai. Pretty smart aliens, maybe, but not God. Dr. Denzler wants to shrink down the aliens, not worship them and \"commit the same logical error that I suggest our ancestors may have made.\" Dr. Denzler wants to shrink the aliens so that when the aliens enter her bedroom she, not the aliens, will \"decide the nature of our relationship.\" Maybe I am making the mistake of giving the aliens too much power, but I think it is a worse mistake to un- derestimate their power, as I believe both Denzler and Deardorff are inclined to do. I worry that just calling the aliens ETs shrinks them too much. 2) If it should be true that modern aliens created West- ern religion-Judaism, Christianity, Islam-how powerful are these aliens? Deardorff says our minds are \"inca- pable of imagining the advances in technology that a mil- lennium of continued evolutionary progress could bring.\" Deardorff thinks the god of Moses would be god with a little \"g.\" But I would ask: how do we decide how much to shrink the power of the aliens? I am working my way through God and the New Phys- ics by Paul Davies. As I read the account of the exist- ence of the \"singularity\" from which we presume our universe exploded, the question came to mind: could be- ings in a laboratory in another dimension have created the singularity? This is a question more for philosophy or phys- ics than for history or the Bible. But if the aliens in our UFOs somehow created our universe-in a laboratory or whatever-do they then qualify to become God with a capi- tal \"G\"? When we are doing UFO and alien research, we are facing some kind of power. A big power. How big I do not know. Whether it is divine or demonic, or a blend, or just advanced ETs, I do not know. Maybe the \"God Hy- May 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"pothesis\" attributes to the aliens too much power. And in the biblical tradition, that would be idolatry. But in the Christian tradition, the crucifixion of Jesus is the story of those who underestimated the power of the one Chris- tians came to call God incarnate. At this point, the God Hypothesis is exactly that-a hy- pothesis, a possibility to be explored. I think it is a good hypothesis, if only to warn us to be careful about the kind of power we may be dealing with. John Mack says UFOs take us to the edge of the sacred. What might this mean for a scientific study of an alien reality? -Dr. Barry Downing Abduction experiences still needed Dear UFO Research Supporter: The UFO Research Coalition, the URC, of which MUFON is a one-third partner, continues to look for re- peat abduction experiencers for their Ambient Monitor- ing Project, the AMP. We have now solicited about as broadly as we can short of advertising directly to the public. Unfortunately we have not had sufficient response to fulfill our needs for the project. As a result we are starting another cam- paign to see if new information on possible subjects may have come to the attention of any of the researchers or investigators we have contacted in the past. If there are any prospects, new or old, in your area, we would like the opportunity to try to work with them. Contact me at tdeuley@ieee.org, by telephone at (210) 804-0552, or at 2827 Sir Phillip Dr., San Antonio, TX 78209  - In the process of our research and solicitations we are in general finding that there are fewer abductions in the past few years and especially few cases of repeat ab- ductions. If this seems to be true in your area we would appreciate a response to that effect. This would-help us verify that abductions are indeed decreasing. We appreciate your assistance and any consideration you may give to our request. -Tom Deuley, URCamp Project Engineer A direction for MUFON Dear Mr. Connelly, The article on FUFOR's January workshop was ex- cellent. May I make a few comments? Examine the impact of current and probable future national and international .situations on ufology. To what extent should MUFON watch its step? Its back? For years elements of the government, including some scientists, have struggled to learn as much as possible about UFOs. Their work has been carefully hidden in the usual ways (classification, compartmentalization, ridicule, manipulation, disinformation, and the junk ufology in the media). . Let's not stubbornly prejudge scientists. Consider all the reasons they might avoid unclassified ufology. Why risk losing job, tenure, and respect for subjects as difficult and potentially dangerous as ours? Has MUFON actu- ally discussed cooperation with non-MUFON scientists with whom it would like to work? Why not privately seek the advice of retired non-MUFON scientists? We need to know details about not only how we have been manipulated, but also by whom and why. A \"nuts and bolts\" only approach may appeal to some scientists and many members of MUFON, but it is se- verely limited. We can draw some conclusions about UFO intelligences from their observed behavior. So far they have shown remarkable restraint in spite of our primitive penchant for violence. -Mary Moore Boulay Airship page changed Dwight, The URL for the reference Airship page has changed.

Varner UFOs were seen Dear Editor: In his research article called \"Were the 1897 Airships UFOs?\" (MUFON UFO Journal, March, 2002), author Fred R. Varner wrote that \"To the best of my knowledge tbere are no UFO reports or factual U.S. Airship reports on record between 1897 and the Second World War when reports of the 'foo fighters' shadowing Allied bombers over Europe emerged. The next instance was the 'ghost rockets' of Sweden in 1948.\" The \"foo fighter\" reports came during late December 1944 and early January 1945 over the German-Belgian-French borders, while the \"ghost rock- ets\" over Sweden actually happened during 1946. But in the MUFON 1997 International UFO Sym- posium Proceedings, Australian writer Warren P. Aston described the American miner Udo Wartena, who said that during early May of 1940 near Townsend, MT, he observed a hovering and then a landed UFO with two occupants who communicated with him. In a 1929 published book called Altai-Himalaya, ex- plorer Nicholas Roerich wrote that while leading an ex- pedition into the unexplored areas of Central Asia on Aug. 5, 1926, he and his party saw in the clear blue sky a bril r liant, metallic object that glinted in the sun and changed direction as it flew overhead and was observed through binoculars by members of the expedition. So it does appear that there were isolated reports of UFOs between 1897 and the \"foo fighter\" incidents of 1944-45 and the Swedish \"ghost rockets\" of 1946. -Kenneth Larson Page 14 MUFON UFO Journal May 2002"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Filer's Files By George A.

UFO over a cruise ship CARIBBEAN — Jeff Sainio reports, \"A well-re- spected co-worker of mine told me about a sighting in August, 1971. He was serving on a Navy aircraft carrier in the Caribbean. (Exact location was not revealed to the crew) \"After his shift ended at midnight, he headed to a rear deck (where smoking was allowed) for his nicotine fix, along with some 20 other smokers. They passed a pleasure cruise ship, close enough to hear the band play- ing, probably under a mile distant. The carrier was blacked-out, while the cruise ship was brightly lit. \"They then noticed a cigar- shaped object, about half the cruise ship length (therefore about 500 feet) tracking above the cruise ship. They could see the object only be- cause it blotted out the stars. As the ships crossed and the tail end of the object was visible, a \"power pack\" became visible, resembling a jet afterburner. \"As the sailors watched in amazement, the object quickly moved backwards an angle of about 90 degrees, then back to its original position, in the span of a few seconds. This was repeated several times, then the ob- ject shot skyward until it disappeared. The sailors had the impression their carrier wasn't noticed until this ac- tion. \"The event was reported to the duty officer, who inter- viewed each witness separately. No secrecy order was given, and nothing resulted from the reports. My co- worker remembered other witness' names for potential corroboration, although I have no reason to disbelieve him.\" Thanks to Jeff Sainio. Jeffrey.Sainio@qg.com Video of daylight disc in Colorado SALIDA — Jennifer Brown-Jacobs visited with Tim Edwards on March 24, 2002, and viewed a video that contained six minutes of a spectacular UFO sighting. Tim's six-year-old daughter pointed out the UFO, and Tim grabbed his camera. Tim's father, his teenage daughter, another witness from across the valley, and two joggers saw the craft. The video is clear and in full daylight. He astutely took it to an independent lab that verified that it was indeed a large object (approximately 1/2 mile in length) hovering at 75,000 feet. Square windows line the sides of two rings set one on top of the other with an inner source of light, sparkling and producing vivid colors. Each ring seems to be moving independently, causing the windows to move in opposite directions, sometimes in tandem. Tim further verified the reality of this sighting by zoom- ing in on the object and pulling out to show the guttering on his house with the object still in sight. Tim told me that at one point in the more than hour-long sighting the object seemed to tilt, and they could clearly see that there was a \"Wheel within a wheel\" that was set perpendicular and was also spinning. This ring also had the same lighted windows, the same \"almost-a-code movement.\" I think that this video is by far the most definitive sight- ing evidence I have encountered in my many years of research. Tim has his video for sale at his restaurant called the \"ET's Landing\" for $19.95, in Salida, CO. $5 for shipping and packaging: If this is what Ezekiel saw, no wonder it's in the Bible!

It was then that he saw that the red light was glowing in the center of a large black Flying Triangle (FT) that was the size of a Jumbo-Jet. Apart from the pulsating red \"fuzzy\" light in the center of the craft, there were three white/bluish lights positioned at each corner. Normally you can hear ducks and wildfowl in the area making quite a din, but now there was complete silence. The FT was hovering quite stationary, and then began to move across the lake slowly, and he could see its reflec- tion in the water. Mr. Herbert says, \"It flew point forward at first, and then as it gathered speed, it slowly turned (on its axis) until it was flying 'flat side' forward as it passed behind me heading east. The central pulsating light began to dim, and the bluish/white lights on the corners changed to amber as it increased its speed. Then quite suddenly, moving at incredible speed, it shot off and then stopped about two miles away.\" It hovered over Badgburry Forest and a microwave tower. The incident took ten minutes.

UFO investigator David Kingston received reports of a bizarre May 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"triangular craft with red and blue lights, zooming across the skies that was first spotted in St. Austell. This con- firms other similar reports not far from Lyme Regis later the same day, then over Portland and Poole. Ufologist Mr. Kingston, first heard aircrew talk of see- ing UFOs during the nuclear tests on Christmas Island in 1957, while in RAF Intelligence. He then witnessed the UFOs himself; that started a lifelong interest in catalogu- ing hundreds of reports. He says: \"I received a number of consistent reports of a craft flying over the West country on Feb. 15,2002, and there is nothing like it in the world aircraft guide. It was triangular, 100 feet long with red lights all the way up on the right hand side and blue lights on the left hand side. Underneath was what appeared to be a very large light, in the middle, glowing pale electric blue through to purple with a corona surrounding it.\" Four people witnessed it and described it as gliding silently at about 2,500 feet and hovering quietly above Portland. The last sighting was near Poole, about two hours after the first. Thanks to Gary Farshores. Huge daylight saucer in Canada ONTARIO — Sue Darroch of Para-Researchers Ottawa reports the March 19, 2002, sighting of a HUGE flying saucer. The witness was in the Gatineau hospital smoking room at 2 PM, which has a panoramic window view of the Ottawa River and downtown Ottawa. A man in the room yelled, \"What the hell is that flying over there?\" The witness also spotted the massive saucer hiding in a lower cloud in a cloudy sky. It moved forward out from the cloud completely revealing itself. She sayb, \"My view was very clear, and amazing, of this huge dark gray me- tallic craft with a round shape-a classic flying saucer! \"The sighting lasted for about thirty seconds, when the object flew north and out of view due to the hospital block- ing the view. The UFO was a little bigger than an airliner, but there were no lights. It couldn't have been over 400 feet above the skyscrapers of downtown Ottawa! Many others must have seen it!\" Thanks to Sue Darroch http:/ 7www.pararesearchers.org. Three silver entities in Australia reported AUSTRALIA'S TERRITORY OUTBACK — UFO sightings have been made almost nightly in Australia's Outback during the past month. People claim to have seen colored lights in the sky, cigar-shaped and hat-like objects moving erratically, and a spate or wave of triangular-shaped craft. One woman claims she was in her vehicle when ap- proached by three silvery creatures after a triangle-shaped craft landed in a paddock 30 kilometers south of Wycliffe on April 11,2002. She says she turned her car around and hurried away. Lou Farkis, a travel lodge manager, said there had been many sightings by workers on the Alice Springs to Dar- win railway. He said: \"There are sightings here all the time, but in the last month they have been seen almost nightly. About five years ago we had a landing just 10 kilometers west of here every night for 28 days in a row. One guy filmed it and a TV channel bought the film from him.\" Mr. Farkis says another worker inadvertently pho- tographed a UFO while taking pictures of work at a nearby bridge. \"When he got the photograph of a bridge girder developed in Darwin, there was an object, like a big, black ball, in the background.\" http://www.news.com.au. Air Victory Museum to expand UFO display I am now building an expanded UFO Exhibit at the Air Victory Museum in Medford, NJ, 20 miles east of Philadelphia at the South Jersey Regional Airport. There is now small display of 40 UFO pictures next to an F-14 Tomcat fighter aircraft. One out of every five visitors, particularly the children ask about UFOs. The museum wants to greatly expand the UFO display to give its patrons what they ask for. We can use your help with photos, videos, etc. This will be the largest UFO display east of Roswell, where fifty million people can reach in a day's drive. The Phantom F-4, F-14 Tomcat, A-7 Corsair, E2-B Hawkeye, F-1Q4 G are among the aircraft on display. The nonprofit educational museum emphasizes victory through Air Power, and that America's youth should seek careers in the applied sciences. The museum emphases extraordinary examples of aerospace technological achievements. Some of the greatest examples are in our skies and reported in these files. http:// www.airvictorymuseum.org. Spheres seen in Ohio CINCINNATI — On March 20, 2002, we spotted several spherical objects that moved in straight lines, and also hovered in place for several seconds at about 9:40 PM. The witness spotted a sphere that was switching from a silver to dark green color, and once in a while reddish. My co-worker spotted several others, with the main one heading west, then back east. r They hovered in place for several seconds and went up through the clouds out of sight. They moved in very straight lines. Diamond shape in Missouri ST. LOUIS —The witness reports seeing \"an object in the shape of a diamond at 5:30 PM flying over St. Louis City, where I live, on March 28, 2002. The object had two blinking lights on both sides, and it was surrounded by a fog of some sort. It stopped in mid-flight, then took off straight up.\" Thanks to NUFORC http:// www.ufocenter.com Zigzagging object reported in Florida OVIEDO — The witness spotted two small sphere- shaped metallic craft that were zigzagging while flying quickly through the air, noting, \"It was late morning/early afternoon on March 21,2002, when my Mom and I looked out the sliding glass door to see two shiny metallic whitish spheres zip by. \"There was no time to grab a camera, since the ob- Page 16 MUFON UFO Journal May 2002"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"jects were going so fast and were about half to a mile away.

In a matter of 30 seconds or less the two zigzagging craft were gone.\" Crescent-shaped object reported in Maryland ANNAPOLIS — The witness was on his balcony at 10:35 PM, watching some flights of local and commercial aircraft with a slightly overcast sky with high haze, but some stars were visible, including the Big Dipper. He says, \"I saw a distinct crescent-shaped form, moving west on April 2, 2002. There was no light, erratic movement, or change, simply a thin cloud-like \"C\" shape moving across the sky. \"Had I not been in a reclining posture, I would not have seen it. The form went by rapidly, but not so fast that I didn't have time to comprehend what was happen- ing and concentrate on the object. It seemed a 'black' object was moving across the sky and creating a pres- sure zone ahead of its path.\" Shape-changing lights in Illinois WHEATON — The witness was watching the sun- set on March 27, 2002, when he saw two strange orange lights slowly approach each other on a deliberate collision course. Just before the crash, they stopped, and both turned into perfect orange lines, each one half of a centi- meter in length. \"I was awestruck by the two lights that they were not moving at all, or at least not flying at plane-like speeds to any degree,\" he says. \"They flew in formation for thirty seconds and then the lines disintegrated back into orange lights and continued on their paths without colliding, though getting EXTREMELY close to hitting each other. The lights continued to move along their straight courses until both ran into a smaller cloud, never to return.\" Two bright lights in Illinois GREENFIELD — The witness went to lock her door on March 21, 2002, and glanced out the door window at 11:12 PM, and saw \"a slow moving UFO with two very bright lights. It was very bright like a planet on a clear night except that it had two bright lights side by side and was moving slowly.\" The witness states, \"I woke my husband up, and he saw it; at first he thought it was a planet until he noticed it was moving. I thought I had time to get my camcorder, but it was gone by the time I got outside. There was a strange hovering sound and then nothing.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport Director of NUFORC http:// www.ufocenter.com Wyoming lights in formation LARAMIE — On April 4, 2002, a cluster of approxi- mately 15 lights appeared and fanned out into a V shape while flying overhead at Laramie at 7:45 PM. The wit- ness claims, \"This is the third time I have seen the flying triangle. Two years ago, within a two-week span, I saw a similar thing and thought it was weird, but did not report it. He said, \"Tonight I saw what appeared to be fifteen lights in a clustered shape in the sky, not far enough away to be stars, but about as far as an aircraft might fly. The cluster changed shape as I looked towards it, and fanned out into a V shape. It continued to fly straight ahead and I looked away.\" Thanks to NUFORC Arizona orbs and dark rounded shape QUARTZITE — The witness saw a very bright cir- cular light with a rounded dark object behind it appear, move northeast, and then disappear, on March 20, 2002. It was low in the sky and moving horizontally at 11:30 P.M., then quickly veered upwards. The witness reports, \"In back of the bright light we could see a dark rounded shape. The sky was very clear that night and we are in a very rural area with no city lights. Then the bright light vanished into nothing. There was no sound, and either the object was very large or very low in the sky. \"There was a great deal of light movement activity in the sky afterwards for over an hour. Lights moving ver- tically, zigzagging, steady lights, rapidly blinking lights, dis- appearing lights, but they were not nearly as big as the first one we saw.\" Yellow-orange circle photographed in Canada COOMBS, BC — The witness lives in the woods and was taking out her dog on a dark overcast night with no lights around at 12:20 AM. She reports, \"When I stepped out the door on March 29,2002,1 couldn't help but notice a bright yellow orange circle moving very slow from west to east just above me about a mile up, but below the clouds. \"Suddenly it stopped for about 15 seconds, so I ran in the house and grabbed my camera and took 3 or 4 pic- tures before it turned north and moved away very slowly. All of a sudden sparks shot from it. It stayed in place for another 10 seconds as I talked to my brother on the phone, telling him what I saw and describing what it was doing, and then it just disappeared.\" Mexico light falls, then stops PUERTO PENASCO — The witnesses were camp- ing on the beach on March 31,2002, looking at what they thought was a shooting star falling from the sky over the ocean. Suddenly it stopped and hovered. The witnesses could see it was a circle with small changing colors of red, blue, white and moving rapidly around from side to side and up and down.

Moseley & Karl T. Pflock, Prometheus Books. Amherst, NY. 2002, 6X9 hardback, 371 pages plus 16-page photo insert, $25.00 ($17.50 at Amazon). Reviewed by Dwight Connelly Perhaps the first thing which should be noted is that this book is essentially by Moseley, not Pflock, since the latter contributes only a four-page prologue and fewer than two pages of the remainder of the book. Perhaps Pflock's name is on the book to help sales, or maybe his success with his Roswell book, also published by Prometheus, has something to do with getting this book published. A book put out by Prometheus automatically indicates, in some eyes at least, that the book will be anti-UFO-6r, as in Pflock's case, just anti-Roswell. Moseley's book basically fits into the anti-UFO cat- egory, but Moseley, like Pflock, is more of a skeptic than a debunker. It is interesting that when it comes to UFOs, the two authors do not necessarily agree on specific cases. Pflock, for example, thinks the Betty & Barney Hill case probably occurred. Moseley seems not to endorse this or any other major or minor case. Called the \"Reigning Court Jester of Ufology\" by former Journal editor Dennis Stacy, Moseley does not find this tag objectionable. Says he, \"As I've long since given up taking the trouble to research UFO events in great depth, and I do have some original thoughts on various ufological topics, the only reasonable role for me in The Field is that of a court jester, chiding and poking fun at Serious and Semi-Seri- ous Ufologists and other Leading Lights in such a way that they are not moved to cut me off completely-but may be moved to rethink their various notions and nos- trums.\" This he does in Shockingly Close to the Truth, as in various other publications over the years. What saves this book from being nothing more than a series of at- tacks on the foibles of various individuals and organiza- tions is Moseley's detailed honesty about his own short- comings. How many ufologists, for example, would tell about faking a burned landing trace or faking a film of a UFO sighting for personal gain? He even tells of setting up a ficticious dispute between himself and Gray Barker in order to gain more readers for his newsletter. For that matter, how many authors would tell about digging,into ancient graves in Peru and illegally spiriting the plunder out of the country-again for personal gain-then use the experience as the book's sub-title? It is a cliche to say of a book, \"Once I started reading it, I just couldn't put it down,\" but that was the case for me with this book. It is certainly that interesting-although the late receipt of the book and the fast-approaching dead- line for this issue of the Journal may also have also had something to do with it. Moseley talks about people and events that I have known-or at least known of-since my days with Skyldok, the UFO Monthly back in the 70's. The book, of course, goes even farther back than that. He provides insights-from his own unique perspec- tive, naturally-into Hynek (pro), Adamski (con), Fried- man (pro & con), Hopkins (con), Maccabee (con), Andrus (con), Jacobs (con), Klass (pro & con), the Betty & Barney Hills case (con), the Walton case (con), and many'others (mostly con). Regardless of whether or not I agreed with him on his assessments of the cases and individuals, I always had the feeling while reading this book that he was being to- tally honest (or at least shockingly close). While I feel that Moseley gave a disproportionate amount of space to the \"kooks\" and con men who are always with us, these are the people he apparently has found most interesting. And, as already noted, he did not ignore the better-known researchers (although I'm sure most would have preferred to have been ignored). The 16 pages of photos featuring Gray Barker, Dan Fry, Truman Bethurum, Long John Nebel, John Keel, Tiny Tim, and others, including several pictures of the never- shy author, are a nice bonus. There is also a good index. Moseley, now 71, made excellent use of the daily diary he has kept all these years, revealing a half century of digging into ufological people and events (as well as Pe- ruvian graves). At a time when so many UFO books are not worth buying, this autobiography by one of the long- time players in the ufology game is a welcome addition. Your ufological library will not be complete without Shockingly Close to the Truth. And if it makes you an- gry, Moseley will no doubt be especially happy.

Like most ufologists, he has some definite favor- ites. At the top of the  _ list for the 1990s, for ex- ample, is the Varginha case in Brazil. \"This is a very strong case,\" says Good. \"There were both mili- tary and civilian wit- nesses, bodies were re- covered, a military po- liceman lost his life af- ter handling one of the bodies, and there was reportedly a video-taped autopsy.\" He adds, \"Among the investigators were Bob Pratt and Cynthia Luce, and I have the highest regard for them. I don't personally know the other investigators, although I have worked with some of them. One is a lawyer, which should add something to his credibility.\" It is not certain that the creatures were extraterres- trial, he notes, \"but there was at least one sighting of a craft in some sort of trouble which may be connected to this case.\" Good discusses Varginha in his latest book, Unearthly Disclosure (2000). Another case which Good feels is strong also involves a creature. This is the Filiberto Caponi case in Italy, which was also featured in Unearthly Disclosure. In multiple chapters, Good describes the photographing of the crea- ture by Caponi. It is this case, in fact, which accounts for a third of the $50,000 which Good spent in researching this latest book-an example of how a thorough researcher requires funding, while the armchair author does not. Investigations in Puerto Rico accounted for additional significant expenditures as Good attempted to check out such items as the lateral displacement of an aircraft, strange creatures (one of whom was apparently shot by a policeman at point blank range), and underground or undersea bases. In spite of the expenditure of large sums of money and a tremendous amount of time in researching cases, Good reports that he is still occasionally misled by witnesses. When this occurs, he makes every effort to correct the information. In Beyond Top Secret, for example, he not only added new cases to his previous book, Above Top Secret, but also corrected some items as he became aware of additional information. \"I can be bamboozled,\" he admits. \"Witnesses just don't realize how much they hurt research and under- standing when they lie. Of course some witnesses are simply fantasizing and do not realize they are lying.\" Despite their lack of validity in the eyes of some ufologists, Good does not shy away from contactee cases, discussing them at length in his books and in lectures. He attempts to separate the legitimate contactees from the others by spending a great deal of time with them, check- ing their statements against other available information, and evaluating their general reputations for truthfulness. One contactee which he still feels may be legitimate is George Adamski, which he discussed in some detail in Alien Base (1998). \"Sometimes contactees start out truth- fully,\" he explains, \"but then for one reason or another expand on the truth, as Adamski did. Like abduction cases, the contactee cases are minefields-a hall of mirrors.\" At this point Good has no plans for additional books, although he continues to investigate cases. \"The time is not right for another book,\" he explains. \"My readers would expect an even more sensational book next time- and I thought Unearthly Disclosure was pretty sensa- tional-but the material is just not there right now, and I'm not going to invent cases.\" He says the expense of researching a book also has to be considered at a time when UFO books are not selling well. \"I received a large advance for Alien Base\" he notes, \"and this allowed me to do a lot of research on Unearthly Disclosure. But I'm wiped out now, I'll tell you!\" Another factor in writing the types of detailed books for which Good is known is the time factor. Above Top Secret, for example, took ten years to write. Its \"sequel,\" Beyond Top Secret, took two years. At this point in his life, Good could be having second thoughts about getting so involved in ufology, despite his successes. With his many talents and an extremely re- warding career as a classical violinist, he could have en- joyed the good life without going public on UFOs. But he has no regrets, saying, \"I'm driven to work with this topic.\" Like many ufologists, his interest in ufology was ig- nited by Maj. Donald Keyhoe's book, The Flying Sau- cers Are Real. His enthusiasm is also partly explained by the fact that he has had several personal sightings, includ- ing a large tetrahedral-shaped object (which he thinks may have been a French balloon) hovering over London in 1963. In 1980, also in London, he had a brief sighting of what others watched for over an hour (using binoculars), described as an elongated triangle-shaped object similar to the one which landed outside Woodbridge US Air Base ten days or so later. A different sort of \"sighting\" may have occurred in 1963 in a restaurant near the Arizona-California border on Good's first tour of the U.S. with the Royal Philhar- monic Orchestra. His attention was drawn to a waitress May 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"with \"blond bobbed hair, delicate pale features, and a pe- tite figure\" with \"almost transparent skin.\" He says the girl would later remind him of George Adamski's descrip- tion of Kalna. He determined to try mental telepathy on the girl, ask- ing, \"Are you from another planet?\" Good says, \"There was no immediate response, but as she left the queue, she made a point of walking past my table, pausing to give me a gracious smile and an actual bow of acknowledgement before proceeding to another part of the restaurant with a 'dead-pan' expression on her face.\" While Good found this experience interesting, it was an experience in New York in February of 1967 which made the real difference in his approach to ufology. He was in the Big Apple with the London Symphony Or- chestra for a series of concerts in Carnegie Hall, and was seated in the lobby of the Park-Sheraton Hotel when he decided to test a theory of alien contact. Good concentrated on making mental contact with whatever entity might be available, sending out the fol- lowing message: \"If any of you are in the New York area, come and sit beside me and prove who you are. Now I realize that there are all sorts of unusual people in a New York hotel lobby,\" says Good, \"but what happened is ex- traordinary. \"A man walked up and sat down beside me. He was immaculately dressed, about 5' 10\", well-proportioned, tanned, about 35 years old, and if I could place his coun- try of origin, I would say Sweden-so there you have the Nordic aspect. \"Anyway,\" Good continues, \"he superficially scanned the New York Times, but said nothing. In my mind I said, 'If you are who 1 think you might be, raise your right index finger and place it to the right side of your nose.' He immediately did exactly that. I wanted to say some- thing to him, but, being British, we don't normally talk to people without an introduction, so I said nothing. I tried more mental telepathy, but got no results. \"He got up, looked at me seriously, and walked away. I shall regret to the end of my days that there was no conversation. I would still recognize him. This incident changed my life. It gave me proof. That was when I decided to go public.\" Good will continue going public this summer as one of the presenters at the MUFON International Symposium in Rochester, NY. One of the cases he will touch on is Roswell, which continues to hold interest despite the many books, articles, and internet debates, pro and con. Good's fascination with Roswell is multi-faceted, but one aspect is particularly intriguing. \"In an article by Billy Cox in Florida Today,\" explains Good, \"the late Brig. Gen. Tho- mas Jefferson DeBose made a statement that Gen. Clements McMulIen, acting commander of the Strategic Air Command at Andrews AAF, ordered a containment strategy at Roswell-a cover-up-and he gives the rea- sons. I find this compelling.\" Good says he will also discuss the reported study of strange materials by a group of international scientists in 1974-materials reportedly provided by the U.S. govern- ment. His source, a German reporter, says he obtained the story from a Polish biophysicist, who was part of the group. The scientists reportedly met again in 1977, this time at the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) in California, where they were shown an unusual skull and hip bone. The materials studied by the group reportedly came from two 1947 incidents in New Mexico. \"I have not yet met the Polish biophysicist,\" says Good, \"but I am reasonably sure I can get his name. I plan to follow up on this.\" NASA okays testing of anti-gravity device Laws are made to be broken. Or so the National Aeronautics and Space Administration seems to think. After an almost two-year wait, the agency's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., is poised to take delivery of a machine that proponents hope will counteract the laws of gravity. At the heart of the device is a purported effect so radical it could change the way we interact with one of nature's most fundamental forces. We're talking revolution, not evolution. A revolution in spaceships would be just one spinoff. Back here on Earth, the internal combustion engine could become an endangered species, replaced by gravity-pow- ered cars, planes and elevators. The dream of defying gravity has a long, and ignoble history. From Icarus on, the road is littered with failed attempts to unbind our feet from the shackles of nature's most seemingly inexorable force. But the team behind the NASA project say they are basing their ef- forts on real science, and NASA has paid almost $600,000 to have the machine custom-built by Ohio-based Superconductive Components, Inc. (SCI), a company that specializes in high-tech ceramics and superconducting materials. Says SCI Vice President James R. Gaines Jr.: \"If it works, what a hoot!\" Revolutions are usually bloody affairs, and this one is no exception. Many physicists be- lieve the whole project is a waste of time, based on un- substantiated research of dubious origin. Gravity, they contend, is in no danger of diminution-the only thing they see at stake is NASA's credibility. In 1992, Russian physicist Evgeny Podkletnov published the results of an experiment in which he claimed to have discovered a \"gravity-shielding\" effect. According to the article, Podkletnov had managed to reduce the force of gravity on a small object by up to 2%-in effect, he had reduced its weight. Now 2% may not sound like much, but to the physics community, it was like a bomb blast. The law of gravity is one of science's most sacrosanct principles; any breaching of its walls would represent a major threat to the current theoretical frame- work. If verified, such a finding would bag its discoverer a Nobel Prize. But here's the rub: Podkletnov's paper was hazy on the details.

Friedman One of the most frequently asked questions after my lectures or during radio and TV interviews is, \"Why is the government not telling us what it knows about flying sau- cers? Is it fear of panic like the reaction to the Orson Wells' 'War of the Worlds' radio program in 1938?\" Apparently people have no problem with the evidence I present that indeed the subject of flying saucers is a kind of Cosmic Watergate. I show the blacked out CIA and NSA documents, the whited out NSA documents, and review some of the lies told by Air Force and other officials. But the kicker seems to be WHY? I normally start by saying that obviously I am not a spokesman for any government agency, but here are the five major reasons that I believe help explain (not justify) the coverup: Technology most important consideration  Stanton T. Friedman 1. From a government's view- point, what is most important about flying saucers is the technology; not the philosophical implications of man not being alone, so often proclaimed by the SETI (Silly Effort to Investigate) cultists. The first country to duplicate the ability of flying sau- cers to move at very high speed and very slowly, to make right angle turns at very high speed, to move up and down vertically, usually with little noise or exhaust or visible external engines, will rule the planet. Having wreckage and lots of classified technical data about flight perfor- mance, naturally a secret project was set up to try to learn as much about the technology as possible and to tell our enemies as little as possible about what we have learned. A basic rule of security is that one can't tell one's friends without telling one's enemies. Fifty-five years is a very very short time to try to learn the technological se- crets of a civilization(s) that might be thousands or mil- lions of years ahead of us, especially since technological progress comes from doing things differently in an unpre- dictable way. 1, for one, don't want technical data out on the table where Saddam can have easy access. Who gets it first? 2. Governments must be concerned about the possi- bility of \"The other guy\" (and every country has an \"other\" guy) figuring out how they work before we do. How do we defend against the new technology? We certainly don't want them to know we know they know. If they have a new poison gas, and we figure out an antidote, then they have to change the gas, we have to change the antidote, etc. Mankind has been playing these silly, but deadly, games for eons. Bigger clubs, stronger shields. A pri- mary espionage target is determining what the other guy knows. A political problem 3. The third problem for governments is political. What happens if an announcement were to be made by people respected around the world (The Queen and the Pope??) that some UFOs are indeed ET spacecraft? I think Church attendance would increase, as would mental hospital ad- missions. The stock market would go down. But I think one of the most important reactions, based on more than 600 college lectures, would be a push from the younger generation (which unlike me was never alive when there wasn't a space program) for a new view of ourselves as Earthlings (Terrans?) instead of as Ameri- cans, Canadians, Peruvians, Chinese, etc). Some people immediately think \"wouldn't that be great??\" Unfortunately, I know of no government that wants its citizens to owe their primary allegiance to the planet in- stead of that government. Nationalism is the only game in town. There certainly isn't anybody who truly speaks for the planet. I can't imagine a galactic federation offering membership to individual countries, any more than the UN offers membership to cities. Actually I don't think our planet yet qualifies for membership in the Cosmic Kindergarten. A devilish question 4. Certain Christian fundamentalists in the USA (Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell) have strongly expressed the view that mankind represents the only intelligent beings in the universe, and that this flying saucer stuff is the work of the devil. These guys were very close politically to Ronald Reagan and Bush senior. They would be up the creek without a religious paddle should an announcement be made. It is interesting that the Mormons, Hindus, Muslims, etc all accept the notion that there is intelligent life out there. It's the economy, stupid! 5. The fifth difficulty is economic. Suppose that an announcement were made, obviously not quietly, but care- fully, saying that indeed Earth is being visited by intelli- gently controlled ET spacecraft. I believe that many people, so long as no direct threat were being presented, such as was the case in \"War of the Worlds,\" would say that obviously the aliens are much more advanced tech- nologically than are we, since they are coming here and we can't go there. Probably this would suggest that soon May 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"there would be new methods of energy production, of ground and air transport, of computing and communica- tions. In short, economic chaos. Who would be the winners? Who the losers? Remem- ber that in the late 1980s the countries~of the West were saying that if only the Russians would take down the Ber- lin Wall and have elections, freedom, democracy, and capi- talism, everything would be great. They have had those things and everything is terrible. We Earthlings don't seem to be very good at large-scale economic transitions. Knowledge is power I am sure that readers can think of other reasons, such as the government has made a deal with the aliens, per- haps swapping access to medical examinations of earth- lings for advanced technology. Perhaps they know that something terrible will happen and there is nothing that can be done about it, etc etc etc. The point here is that Knowledge is Power. Ameri- cans and other nationalities long ago conceded that infor- mation would be kept from the public in the interests of National Security. After all, the Director of Central Intel- ligence in 1996, because of a court action, was forced to admit that his total black budget that year was only $26.6 billion dollars. That represents a lot of effort with little oversight by elected officials. Those in power want to stay in power. Elected officials take as their first duty the need to be re- elected. Those with access to very highly classified infor- mation take as their first duty the need to keep it from all but the very few having a need to know. May 11.

Source: New Scientist The dream of teleporting atoms and molecules-and maybe even larger objects-has become a real possibility for the first time. The advance is thanks to physicists who have suggested a method that in theory could be used to \"entangle\" absolutely any kind of particle. Quantum entanglement is the bizarre property that al- lows two particles to behave as one, no matter how far apart they are. If you measure the state of one particle, you instantly determine the state of the other. This could one day allow us to teleport objects by transferring their properties instantly from one place to another. Until now, physicists have only been able to entangle photons, electrons and atoms, using different methods in each case. For instance, atoms are entangled by forcing them to interact inside an optical trap, while photons are made to interact with a crystal. \"These schemes are very specific,\" says Sougato Bose of the University of Oxford. But Bose and Dipankar Home, of the Bose Institute in Calcutta, have now demonstrated a single mechanism that could be used .to entangle any particles, even atoms or large molecules. To see how it works, consider the angular momentum or \"spin\" of an electron. To entangle the spins of two electrons, you first need to make sure they're identical in all respects but their spin. Then you shoot the electrons simultaneously into a beam splitter. This device \"splits\" each electron into a quantum state called a superposition, which gives it an equal probability of travelling down either of two paths. Only when you try to detect the electron do you know which path it took. If you split two electrons simultaneously, both paths could have one electron each (which will happen half of the time) or either path could have both. Bose and Home show mathematically that whenever one electron is detected in each path, they will be en- tangled. While a similar effect has been demonstrated before for photons, the photons used were already en- tangled in another before they reached the beam splitter. \"One of the advances we have made is that these two particles could be from completely independent sources,\" says Bose. The technique should work for any objects- atoms, molecules and who knows what else-as long as you can split the beam into a quantum superposition. Anton Zeilinger, a quantum physicist at the University of Vienna in Austria, has already shown that this quan- tum state is possible with buckyballs-football-shaped mol- ecules of C[60]. Although entangling such large objects is beyond our technical abilities at the moment, this is the first technique that might one day make it possible. Any scheme that expands the range of particles that can be entangled is important, says Zeilinger. Entangling massive particles would mean they could then be used for quantum cryptography, computing and even teleportation.

Lowest and 1 st to disap- pear after about midJune is Mars (magnitude 1.7). It sets around 10 PM early in the month. Next up in the western sky is Jupiter (-1.9). The giant planet pairs up with Ve- nus on the 3rd, making a striking sight. The big world is joined by the lunar crescent on the 12th. Jupiter sets about 10 PM in midmonth. Highest of the planet trio is Venus (-4.0), not setting in the NW until about 11 PM. The crescent Moon is visible near the bril- liant planet on June 13. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): There are no bright morning planets visible this month. Partial Solar Eclipse: On June ] 0 the new moon hides part of the Sun's face, the entire event visible from most of the U.S., Alaska, and Hawaii, except for the eastern states where the Sun sets during or at the start of the eclipse. Local times of maximum eclipse with obscuration per- centages at several cities follow: Honolulu. 2:42 PM, 41%: San Diego, 6:24 PM, 74%: Seattle. 6:04 PM. 37%; Den- ver, 7:16 PM. 40%. Houston, 8:23 PM, 55%; Chicago, 8:10PM, 19%. Elsewhere the event assumes the form of an annular or ring eclipse observable in a very narrow zone stretch- ing across the Pacific from Indonesia to Mexico. The rule for safely viewing this type of eclipse: Do not look directly at the Sun unless you use a special eye filter such as a #14 welder's glass. If uncertain, observe the eclipse indirectly by projecting the Sun's image through a telescope or binocular eyepiece onto a white surface. Moon Phases: Last quarter-June 2 New moon-June 10 First quarter-June 17 Full moon-June 24 The Stars: The celestial meridian at 11 PM divides the night sky into springtime stars in the W (Leo. Bootes, Virgo) and summer stars in the E. The Summer Triangle is now fully visible above the eastern horizon. The stars Vega, Deneb, and Altair form the corners of this spring sky symbol. Hercules with his little 4-sided \"Keystone,\" Ophiuchus the Serpent Bearer (shaped like a large tent), Scorpius with its reddish heart star Antares, and Sagittarius the Archer all occupy the eastern half of the heavens. Straddling the meridian in the S is the upside-down crown of Princess Ariadne, Corona Borealis, and, lower down, a distorted rectangle, Libra the Scales, on which nearby Virgo weighs the fate of mortals.
