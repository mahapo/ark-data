FROM THE EDITOR Looking through back issues of the MUFON UFO Journal, I am quite impressed with the way Richard Hall handled the job as editor for the past five and a half years. As I struggled to put together this, my first issue, I can only begin to appreciate the amount of time, effort and skill it took. Not only did he very capably edit the Journal but he was also a major contributor of articles. If I do half as well as he did, I will be pleased. If my first few issues appear a bit ragged, please bear with me. With Richard in Maryland, MUFON headquarters in Texas, the printer in Missouri and me in Florida, I am flying blind much of the time with no one at my elbow to turn to. My first priority is to get the Journal back to current status as soon as possible. At the same time and thereafter, I will search for ways to better serve the interests of all Journal readers.

An unexpected and welcome visitor at the conference, Jenny is a well known investigator and author of six books on UFOs published in Britian. -Bob Pratt, Editor VERDICT ON UFO COVERUP: GUILTY Official government documents on the subject of unidentified flying objects give clear evidence that UFOs have posed a threat to national security and may have human survival implications as well. That is the charge made by Larry Fawcett, assistant state director for MUFON in Connecticut and co-author of the book Clear Intent. The book, written with Barry Greenwood and to be published in April by Prentice-Hall, claims the government has long covered up the truth about UFOs. \"There is now a new case for the UFO and the evidence for it is in government records,\" Fawcett told a conference on \"UFOs & Government Coverup\" at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln on November 12. \"I know what evidence is and how evidence must be presented in a court of law,\" he said, explaining that he has been a police officer for the last 14 years. \"I will present evidence to you as if you, the audience, were a jury. Your only job will be to hear the case and listen to the testimony presented. At the end of my presentation, you must reach a verdict. \"The defendant is the U.S. Government. The charge I am leveling is the continual coverup of the UFO experience by the government. The testimony will be the government's own documents on UFOs.\" For the next hour, he showed on a large screen previously classified documents containing testimony of scientists, military personnel, intelligence personnel, law enforcement officers and other reliable and responsible people. The documents were obtained through the Freedom of Information Act by himself, Greenwood and other UFO researchers, including Peter Gersten, Robert Todd, Larry Bryant, Charles Buffer, Dr. Bruce Maccabee, Stan Friedman, Raymond Fowler and William Moore. Citing the support of such organizations as Citizens Against UFO Secrecy, the Center for UFO Studies, MUFON and the Fund for UFO Research, he said that more than 4,000 pages of documents relating to UFOs have been obtained from the government since 1977. \"Some were released voluntarily, others had to be pried loose by means of court action,\" he said. \"Obtaining the documents was not always easy.\" He related in detail the visit that CAUS Research Director Robert Todd received from two FBI agents on July 28, 1978, in connection with queries he had made concerning a UFO report. \"They explained to him the espionage laws and added that'the laws carry a penalty of life in prison or death if one is found to be in violation of these laws. \"Another method used by the government to discourage individuals from filing requests for UFO documents would be to levy extraordinarily high search and repro- duction fees against the requests. \"For example, in response to a CAUS request for information regarding uncorrelated observations or UFO radar trackings, the North American Aerospace Defense Command informed CAUS that the retrieval of these records would take 18,383 hours and would cost $294,157. \"One can imagine the look on a general's face if the country were in a serious national security dilemma and important decision making information took that long to obtain. In this computer age, the idea that NORAD's indexing system is in such a mess that it takes over 18,000 hours to make specific information available is beyond belief.\" Then, as documents were displayed on a large screen behind him, Fawcett discussed a number of UFO incidents reported at military bases, including the following: • Hunter Army Airfield, Georgia, Sept. 8, 1973. Two military policemen saw an \"Object at treetop level that made an apparent dive at their vehicle, seemingly just missing the vehicle, and (continued on next page) Philip Klass tried to scuttle the University of Nebraska's conference on UFOs and the Government Coverup, contending that, among other things, UFO groups which question the integrity of the government are aiding the Communist cause. —see Director's Message, by Walt Andrus, on back cover."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Fawcett, continued appearing again later at another location and hovering for 15 minutes in front of them.\" • Algeria, March 1975. A State Department Message from the Secretary General of the Algerian Defense, Ministry reported \"UFOs maneuvering over Algerian airspace...Object maneuvers and was seen to land and take off. Sighting was first by radar and secondly visual.\" • Several military bases in the United States and Canada, October and November 1975. \"Malmstrom search and height finder radars carried the object between 9,500 ft. and 15,600 ft. at a speed of seven knots ...As the interceptors approached, the lights went out. After the interceptors had passed, the lights came on again. One hour later...the object increased to a high speed, raised in altitude and could not be discerned from the stars...Minot AFB on Nov. 10 reported the site was buzzed by a bright object the size of a car.. .The next day, the commander and other personnel at a radar station at Falconbridge, Ontario, tracked an object on radar...With binoculars, the object appeared to be a 100 ft. diameter sphere and appeared to have craters around the outside.\" • Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico, Jan. 21,1976. \"Two UFOs are reported near the flight line. Security police reported them to be 25 yards in diameter, gold or silver in color with a blue light on top, hole in the middle and red light on bottom.\" The document, from the National Military Command Center in Washington, D.C., was signed by a rear admiral who was deputy director of operations at the time. • Fort Ritchie, Maryland, July 30, 1976. \"Two separate patrols reported sighting three oblong objects with a reddish tint moving east to west...Five minutes later, sergeant observes UFO over the ammo storage area at 100-200 yards altitude.\" • Pinecastle range, Naval Air Station, Jacksonville, Florida, May 14, 1978. Unidentified blip observed on radar for an hour, then moves rapidly across scope at 400-500 knots, then reverses direction and stops. During this time, eight naval personnel in the control tower visually observed red, green and white lights for more than an hour. , • Kuwait, Jan. 29, 1979. Message from the U.S. Embassy to the State Department tells of UFO appearing over northern oil fields which \"seemingly did strange things\" to the automatic pumping equipment. When the UFO appeared, the equpment shut itself down. But when the UFO \"vanished,\" the system automatically started back up. Other documents related to incidents occurring at a number of SAC bases along the northern tier of the United States in October and November 1975, including one at Loring Air Force Base in Maine about an object that \"demonstrated,a clear intent in the weapons storage area.\" \"These documents prove beyond a reasonable doubt that unconvention- al aerial objects possessing a highly advanced technology have posed a threat to our national security and may pose a threat to human survival,\" Fawcett said. Then he presented details from two \"quite spectacular UFO incidents\" which took place • in the vicinity of secret facilities at Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and • at RAF Bentwaters, a jointly held British-American NATO base near Woodbridge, England. At Kirtland, Sept. 8, 1980 \"several UFO landings were reported by security policy at the Manzano Weapons Storage Area — supposedly the largest atomic bomb storage site in the world. 'Significant' is hardly adequate to describe these events. But if this is what the public is being allowed to see, what else is being suppressed? To paraphrase Roy Neary in Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind, we just want to know what the hell is going on here.\" LARRY FAWCETT A series of UFO events occurred near RAF Bentwaters in late December 1980. Fawcett said that after he gave a lecture at a college in Connecticut last February, a young man approached him and told him about the incidents. This soon led to the filing of about 50 FOI requests by CAUS research director Robert Todd for information about the incidents. The Department of the Air Force and other agencies claimed to know nothing about the case. Only one unit responded favorably — headquarters of the 513th Combat Support Group, a document management group for the Third Air Force, which includes RAF Bentwaters. \"They released a document which must be regarded as one of the most stunning revelations in the history of UFO research,\" said Fawcett. The document was a memo to the Royal Air Force from Lt. Col. Charles I. Halt, deputy base commander at RAF Bentwaters, relating three separate UFO incidents just outside the base. The first occurred about 3 AM on Dec. 27,1980, when two U.S. Air Force security policemen saw unusual lights outside the back gate of the base. They were given permission to go out and investigate and, according to Colonel Halt's memo: \"The individuals reported seeing a strange glowing object in the forest. The object was described as being metallic in appearance and triangular (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Devious double-talk and mis-use of statistics \"Devious double-talk and gross mis-use of statistics\" was a form of government cover-up of the UFO question that Dr. J. Allen Hynek personally witnessed in his many years as scientific consultant to the U.S. Air Force's Project Blue Book. \"I myself have had some brush with government secrecy and with military intelligence in my years with Project Blue Book,\" Dr. Hynek, director of the Center for UFO Studies, told the audience at the conference on \"UFOs & Government Coverup\" at the University of Nebraska. \"Even my slight contacts with the intelligence hierarchy taught me that they are a class apart. They even consider the American public as sort of an enemy, certainly not to be trusted and definitely not to be told what's going on. \"In Project Blue Book, with which I was associated from its inception to its demise, I frequently saw how the public was regarded. Even though Blue Book was, for cosmetic purposes, officially an unclassified project, that was largely fiction. There was no way for an outsider to get a hand on Blue Book files. Oh, yes, the files were unclassified, but, it was explained, they are kept in classified areas and, so, access was impossible.\" It was a daily practice at Blue Book, he said, to reveal the cases with an easy solution, the identified flying objects, but to say nothing about the \"real interesting cases.\" Dr. Hynek said he often winced at some of the so-called Blue Book fact sheets that were released to the public from time to time. \"They were certainly a form of coverup, and I insisted repeatedly that my name not be used in connection with them. \"Yes, I saw a coverup in Blue Book, but it was not of Watergate proportions, as it apparently has been in other parts of the government. It was merely devious double-talk and gross mis-use of statistics. \"Statistics, of course, can be used as a means of covering up actual facts, and on this I tended to argue many times with various Blue Book directors. They would come out in their fact sheets 'and say only two or three percent of the cases were unexplained. \"How they got those two or three percent is very interesting. First of all, some 17 percent of the cases they classified as 'insufficient information' - and they considered those solved. \"Then, other reports came through they would put down as 'probably aricraft.' It had a light, so 'possibly aircraft.' Or, if it wasn't flying too fast, 'possibly balloon.' \"But at the end of the year, these nice little qualifiers like 'probably' and 'possibly' were dropped. A 'possible balloon' became a balloon. I argued that that was not good statistics. I remember one of the directors as saying, 'But there is no such thing as a possible balloon; it's either a balloon or not a balloon.' \"So, certainly that is a form of coverup. \"Another subtle form of coverup is the U.S. Air Force's public stance on the UFO subject today. If you try to report a UFO to any air base today, and there are quite a few of them, you get exactly the same prepared statement, that they Air Force is no longer concerned with UFOs since they do not pose any threat to national security, and you are politely dismissed. \"Yet, on the other hand, the courts, in refusing access to UFO- related documents, have pled the very opposite. They say they cannot release the documents because of national security.\" Fawcett, continued in shape, approximately two to three meters across the base and approximately two meters high. It illuminated the entire forest with a white light. The object itself had a pulsating red light on top and a bank(s) of blue lights underneath. The object was hovering or on legs. As the patrolmen approached the object, it maneuvered through the trees and disappeared.\" The next day, Halt said, three impressions IY 2 inches deep and 7 inches in diameter were found where the object had been seen, and moderately high radiation was found. Later that night, Halt said, \"a red, sun-like light was seen through the trees. It moved about and pulsed. At one point it appeared to throw off glowing particles and then broke into five separate white objects and then disappeared. Immediately thereafter, three star-like objects were noticed...the objects moved rapidly in sharp angular movements and displayed red, green and blue lights. The objects to the north appeared to be elliptical through an 8-12 power lens. They then turned to full circles.\" At the end of the memo to the RAF, Colonel Halt said that numerous individuals saw the events of the final night — including himself. \"This document,\" Fawcett said, \"proves three things: One, the events occurred; two, a UFO left physical traces; three, the Air Force lied to us under the FOIA. The existence of this document is also an indication that other documents exist and that the Air Force was deeply involved in a coverup of the story.\" The story of the RAF Bentwaters encounter eventually appeared in the British press and \"as a result of the publicity, the Air Force has refused to respond to any further inquiries, thus reinforcing our long held belief that the UFO phenomenon is of such significance that the military finds it necessary to suppress all public discussion of the matter,\" Fawcett said, adding: \"You have now heard .my evidence, It is time for your verdict.\" The applause was instantaneous and loud. The verdict was guilty. 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"BRITISH GOVT. INVESTIGATES UFOS, BUT. The British government, unlike the American government, does investigate reports of UFO sightings — but claims it does so only to make sure the country isn't being invaded by a foreign enemy. \"They say they investigate UFO reports purely for their defense implications and they do not pursue their inquiries to the level where they can positively identify any case,\" says Jenny Randies. \"In other words, as soon as they're satisfied they're not invaders, they don't care what it was, and they're quite happy to say that, in a roundabout way.\"      . Despite that, the British 1 government has amassed records of some 15,000 cases over the years. \"They're not saying like the American government is saying, that we're not interested in getting reports. Quite the opposite, there are official procedures whereby all civilian and military airports a>nd other establishments have to report UFO sightings to the Ministry of Defense.\" The most recent figure given to civilian UFO groups is 6,500 reports in the last five years. \"However, they also openly say, categorically, and they're very emphatic about it,: that they have absolutely no evidence whatsoever that any extraterrestrial spacecraft has landed on this planet,\" says Jenny. However, Ministry officials will — if pushed far enough — say something extremely interesting. \"They say, 'We do not deny there are many strange and puzzling things in the skies,' \" says Jenny. But it'is difficult getting anything -substantial from DS8, the department within the ministry responsible for investigating UFOs. .One case currently under investigation by British ,UFO groups occurred on a summer day in 1948. A York transport carrying the pilot, co- pilot arid four non-commissioned officers was flying north, accompanied by. six Meteor jet fighters, when everyone aboard all the aircraft saw a silver disc at a much higher altitude. Ground radar was tracking the object and operators said it had a diameter of about 100 feet. Two Meteors were ordered to pursue it but as they began to climb, the object accelerated straight out of sight in seconds. The civilian UFO investigators approached the Ministry of Defense concerning the incident but were told the ministry has no records of any UFO events prior to 1962. \"This was. interesting because in 1977, we realized we could approach the ministry for UFO records dated 1947,\" says Jenny. \"In Britain, there is the 30-year rule about documents of this kind, that once 30 years is up you can apply to have'them released. \"So, we did that and we were told, 'Oh, sorry, we can't give them to you 'because what we've decided to do is put all the files on one big file with all UFO reports up to 1950, so come back in 1980 and we'll see what we can do.' \"We did, and guess what? They had all been put in with the UFO reports for 1955. Come back in 1985. They've changed their minds again now, that they haven't got any files prior to I960, so come back in 1990. This could go on forever, of course.\" \"OH, YES, OOPS, SORRY\"' About 2 AM one morning in February 1979, numerous witnesses over an 80 to 100-mile area of Britain saw a large, flaming orange spheroid object. ;, \"It moved in a rather controlled way and was visible to most witnesses for upwards of two minutes, moving steady steady across the sky,\" says Jenny Randies. Among the witnesses were a number of police officers, including two who saw it descend into a quarry, and still another officer in a patrol car who chased it. \"It flew low over the back of another car where a couple were doing something late at night and it so upset them that they dived onto the floor, thinking the car was going to explode,\" says Jenny. Many residents of a trailer park 6 were awakened as the object passed overhead. \"Suddenly, their doors and windows began to rattle and they felt the whole place was going to shake apart. They jumped out of bed and dashed outside just in time to see this orange thing passing overhead and disappear out to sea.\" There were also a number of reports of electromagnetic interference on the radio, with stations being blacked out by the passage ,of the object. \"The usual plethora of possible solutions were presented until a day or so later the Ministry of Defense came up with the answer,\" says Jenny. \"They explained that it was a rather bright meteor. \"They didn't explain how it caused the effects on the radio, how it managed to rattle and shake the buildings or the car, or whatever. When it was reported to them that the object was visible for , far too long to be a meteor and that several of the locations where it was seen happened to have overcast skies, they said, 'Oh, yes, sorry about that. We've now discovered it was actually a civilian aircraft that was landing at a certain airport.' \"They didn't realize, of course, that we had already checked with the civilian airport and got a complete record of every flight in and out. We promptly presented that to the ministry and showed them that there wasn't one flight within 45 minutes of this time, and they said, 'Oh, dear, sorry, we'll try again.' \" The next explanation was that a photo reconnaissance exercise had (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Update on UFO Crash/Retrievals By LEONARD H. STRINGFIELD \"The biggest story ever, never told\" is a catch phrase I have used in the Prologue of my recently published Status Report III, and, I repeat, it may well apply to the postulate that UFOs have crashlanded on Earth and have been secretly retrieved by the military- intelligence establishment worldwide. Needless to say, since I espoused this postulate at the MUFON symposium in 1978, it has shaken UFO research to its roots, and with valid cause. But, while earning measurable respect among our. rank and file, let it be stressed that with all the information collected it remains, to my knowledge, in the controversial and unproved category. In my judgement, all the reports I have received from all levels of independent sources and have had the opportunity to investigate at varying Oops, continued been going on in the area and the ministry officials gave the name of the outfit involved. \"We checked with the people concerned and discovered the photo reconnaissance had taken place the previous evening. So we went back to the Ministry of Defense and they said, 'oh, yes, oops, sorry.' \"They then finally settled on THE solution, that this was, in fact, an American F-lll from a particular U.S. Air Force base that had got lost and was flying around trying to find its way home again.\" The investigators then went to the U.S. air base and asked if that was true. \"I can't repeat what the major actually said but he didn't think very much of that hypothesis. When we got that back to the Ministry of Defense, they didn't answer. \"Eventually, about 18 months later, we got a sheepish admission that, \"Yes, sorry, we possibly were wrong; if the U.S. Air Force said they didn't have an F-lll there, then they didn't have an F-lll there and therefore we don't know what it was.\" This statement was presented at the University of Nebraska's conference on Exploring Unexplained Phenomena II by conference organizer Ray Boeche for Leonard Stringfield, who was not able to attend. depths, are still largely anecdotal. Moreover, they are too random in time sequence or vague on important issues to 'form a strong, linkable pattern. Since publishing Status Report III, there have been no significant breakthroughs, or, one single case rise above the others, old or new, to affirm that alien, extraterrestrial craft has crashlanded on Earth with its recovered crew. Also, without hard support data, it remains difficult for the average human mind to accept the notion that UFOs are alien craft from outer space and, to expect that same mind to swallow \"rumors\" of humanoids captured and preserved at Wright-Patterson AFB, for instance, is unthinkable. If my work can serve as a test for public reaction, I say, indeed, we need more qualitative evidence and better public relations. So, in this generally adverse atmosphere, one or two published affidavits from former military personnel, purporting that they witnessed the alien craft or its occupants, would probably be viewed as unbelievable. Even documented proof, or anything short of a presidential pronouncement, would be questioned or ridiculed by most members of science, many religious sects and the generally benighted public. Subsequently, for myself and my colleagues, finding facts to prove the case for ET and CR, if you will, can be difficult. But my cumulative information, most of it appearing in three published papers, cannot be summarily dismissed either because we do not like it or, it fails to fit the rules set forth by science, or religion, the media, or a Philip Klass. As my probes continue into some of the old cases recorded in my papers, new evidence, both pro and con, has surfaced. Before any conclusions can be reached, however, further investigation is necessary. Sought is clarification of questionable data from the principal source or an new outside source. It does take time and patience. One firsthand case in my recent Status Report III, for instance, reveals some negative aspects based on conflicting testimony from the witness. However, he openly admits the flaws, and attributes his confusion over names, times and places to his blurring state of mind caused by brainwashing techniques. At this point, one objectively may relegate the case to fantasy. Patience won over, however, when the witness called this past week to relate that a new source has emerged who may be willing to provide new support. More time is needed, in all fairness, for final judgement. Another case published in Status Report III re-emerged suddenly after a mysterious three-year silence when my source wrote to one of my colleagues with whom I had shared his name and other data. In his letter, the source alleges that he had been restrained from further contact by visitors who warned him about his disclosures to me. Time will tell if the source will surface as he suggested, or it there will be more interference. This can be a key case and little can be said at this time. Still another turn-around case in Status Report III, reopened by a visit this past summer of an intermediary who knew my firsthand source whose claim was that he was at a Western UFO retrieval site in 1967. Without supplying qualifying details, my visitor, who had worked closely with me when the case initially surfaced, now said he had reason to believe the story was phoney. He based his charge only on the informant's questionable character. Like so many other cases, my informant long ago vanished and remains unreachable for comment. Like finding the proverbial needle (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Stringfield, continued in the haystack is finding the right issue of the right magazine — Pageant or Coronet — published supposedly sometime in 1948 which allegedly featured an article of a UFO retrieval operation in New Mexico, 1948, as described in Case A-4 of my recent Status Report III. Two researchers searched through all issues available of both magazines in academic and public libraries and found nothing on the crashlanded UFO. The magazine in question allegedly was seized from the newstands by the FBI to prevent the story from reaching the public. Four researchers told me they saw the article, one said he mislaid his copy, and another, prominent in the field, told me recently he has a copy whose contents I hope he may share with me. New sources reaching me since publishing my Status Report III, dated June 1982, tell vague stories about UFO crashlandings. Most are cryptic references by a secondhand source to a crash/retrieval, or to an anonymous person's participation in that event which cannot be followed up. But a few have claimed to be in possession of more lurid information, which after the initial promise of great fulfillment, lead to the usual deadends, evasions, silence, and in one known instance, a hoax. The hoax simply was a neatly typed .letter sent to researchers Bill Moore, Todd Zechel and my self in April 1983 from an avowed military retiree who, claiming fragile health, was now ready to blow the whistle about his past in a retrieval operation in New Mexico, 1950. Signed \"Ben De Loof,\" it was a carefully composed, compassionate letter supposedly mailed from a \"drop\" in California. Awaited were our responses to be judged by De Loof to determine who would get the prize of \"inside\" information. I answered, of course, showing ostensible keen interest. In my opinion, the letter was just too glib, offering too much for so little in return, considering the risks to him in such a venture. No one ever before, I thought, had been so eager to help. In short time, the letter had been 8 leaked out to other researchers, one of, whom told me that the letter was a definite hoax. He was able to trace the typing to a source known to be a trouble-maker but he would not disclose the name of the culprit. A week later, another researcher who had been intimate with a trouble-maker in the past was quick to point the guilty finger. The trick was in the name \"De Loof,\" which, by reversing the letters, spelled \"Fooled\". So, those with a sly, sick mind are always underfoot in this sensitive business, as I pointed out in my Status Report III under the heading of \"Supercecrets, etc.\" Others to surface, however, seemed less suspect of fraud. One new source came from a highly respected researcher — an engineer — in California, who chanced on meeting the source at a Kiwanis Club dinner. I was able to get all the basic information by phone, which was followed up by letter requesting more details. My source responded with a taped interview conducted by my engineer friend and there was the promise of more to come. The story intself concerns a large Chicago-based manufacturer — now merged with another company bearing a different name. The time was approximately 1953, when two experts in metallurgy of that company were hired by the Air Force and sent to Arizona, where an alleged alien craft had crashed. Photos (were made into slides) secretly were taken of the craft and placed in the custody of the Secretary- Treasurer of the company. As the story goes, the entrusted officer of the company was a close friend of my source, both of whom were interested in photography. Plans were made to meet privately at the home of my source, where the slides would be projected on screen and studied. But it didn't happen as planned. The FBI interceded, said my source, confiscating the film. I'm still hopefully waiting for word from another new source which came as a result of my colleague, Larry Bryant, whose legal endeavors tried to pry open the lid of Air Force secrecy concerning crashed UFO. As director of the Washington, D.C., office of CAUS, Bryant filed a petition in July of this year in the Federal Court of the District of Columbia against the Air Force for release of information re the captured or deceased aliens. My name and research, being a part of the legal proceedings, surfaced in the newspapers and triggered radio talk shows. One response came from a business man in North Carolina who claimed that his brother, in another state, was in the Air Force for 27 years, most of them stationed at Wright- Patterson AFB. In the early 1950's, he said, his brother witnessed the arrival of a retrieved space craft at the base, which, because of damage, still contained the bodies inside. Said my source, his brother was sworn to secrecy, but might be coaxed to talk to me. He planned to visit him soon to discuss the matter. After a long wait, I phoned and learned that my contact had a bad auto accident and would have to delay his visit with his brother as he will be bed- ridden for several months. Finally, being a guest on a talk show on WLW radio, Cincinnati, produced an anonymous caller who claimed that, while in the Air Force in 1974, he had seen a military photo showing alien bodies. I asked that he send details by letter. In his response, he said the photo showed four humanoid bodies stretched out in an X formation, feet at the epicenter, and whose heads, on the outer edge of a circular base, appeared to be wearing a life support device. The photo, he said, was taken through a translucent canopy, perhaps of glass or plastic. My source, who prefers anonymity, added that he had never discussed the photos with anybody before and felt I needed support in my research. In summary, the story of UFO crash/retrievals still lacks proof, but persons willing to talk about their small roles under an alleged cover up are increasing. Unfortunately, many of my erstwhile sources remain unreachable, each case hinting of mysterious interference. In all honesty, are UFO crash/ retrievals a fact and, in consequence, the biggest story ever, never told?

Beginning last June and continuing through early October, the Pennsylvania Association for the Study of the Unexplained (PASU) was inundated with UFO reports, and dozens are still under investigation. This wave of reports is the largest and most baffling since the famous outbreak of 1973. These incidents are only one category of strange occurrences which appear to be part of a major flap that has produced not only numerous good quality reports of UFO encounters but also other phenomena, such as Bigfoot creatures, black panthers, unusual animal killings, unexplained sounds and apparitions. Most of the UFO activity seems to be centered in the western part of the state. Not only have there been numerous reports of nocturnal lights making erratic movements but also a number of low-level observations of very large, structured objects, both at night as well as in daytime/ By STAN GORDON State Director for Pennsylvania Interestingly, almost all of the close encounter sightings have been accompanied by reports of a very loud, high-pitched sound. Following are some of the more interesting observations. The names of the witnesses have been changed because of their wish to remain anonymous, but their identities are on file at MUFON headquarters. • At about 5:15 AM on July 25 in Latrobe, Tom Jackson was shaving, preparing to go to work, when he noticed a bright light outside his bathroom window. He opened the window and was amazed to find the source of the light was a huge object that was hovering over a group of pine threes about 250 yards south of his home. He described the object as being battleship metallic gray in color, and elongated but with the front and back ends dropping down and rounding off. The object was flat on the top and bottom. There were two rows of what appeared to be four evenly spaced Stringfield, continued there an international cover-up? Or, are all of my informants mentally sick jokesters? Or, is each of my better- grade informants a part of an orchestrated masterplan designed to decieve me and cause confusion in the ranks of research? If it is the later, why? What, I ask, are \"they\" really covering up? Frankly, I have thought of every negative possibility in my endeavor to find the truth. But there is no simplistic answer; .all of the alibis fail to make sense to this date. I have over a hundred sources who have related to me bits of C/R information through intermediaries, and above that striking number are 25 independent firsthand reports from witnesses who allege they have seen the alien craft and/or the occupants. Among my key sources, I must stress, is a medical person who claims he performed an autopsy on an alien body in an Eastern Hospital in the early 1950's. This person still serves on the staff of that major hospital and is highly recognized in his specialized field. Why would he feed me false information risking his profession and cause embarrassment for the hospital? The same applies to other key informants who prefer understandable anonymity. These people I trust and I will not break that bond between us for a moment of glory. Those interested in my research may obfoin my recent monograph, UFO CRASH/ RETRIEVALS: AMASSING THE EVIDENCE.

There was no illumination from these windows. The object was very large, possible 300 feet long. The bright light that Jackson had seen was round and 15 to 20 feet in diameter. It was attached to the front of the structure and appeared to be able to swivel, turning on a radius of 180 degrees. When the light was turned away from the witness, it angled up and cast just enough light off the haze and clouds to silhouette the object. Jackson ran outside and watched as the object stayed motionless above the trees for a couple of minutes. At this time it made no sound. Jackson then ran back into the house and looked out the window and realized the object had now moved and was disappearing in the direction of the Latrobe sewage plant. At this point, the bright white light had now turned a brilliant orange. Jackson had observed the object for almost five minutes. Other Latrobe residents reported seeing a brilliant orange light over the sewage plant, moving toward the southwest. Other residents, unaware of these other incidents, were awakened by a very loud, high-pitched sound so intense that some people complained of suffering severe headaches. The sound seemed to come from above the homes, and dogs in the area were very disturbed while the sound lasted. Reports of this sound followed a line from the Latrobe sewage plant to the village of Lloydsville. .• About two and a half hours later, Mrs. Hood had an encounter with the unknown. She lives on the outskirts of Jeanette, about 10 miles west of Latrobe. Her husband had just left for work and she had dozed off when she was suddenly aroused by a loud, high- pitched whistle sound that shook the windows of her house The noise seemed to be just overhead. Within seconds, a beeping noise (continued on next page) 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Pennsylvania, continued accompanied the other sound and became so intense that it hurt Mrs. Hood's ears and vibrated through her body. Thinking that this might be the Life Flight emergency helicopter, which makes regular visits to the Monsour Clinic nearby, she opened her window and looked outside to see why it was so close. Instead of a helicopter, Mrs. Hood saw a very large object hovering over a wooded area about 450 feet away. She said it looked like a giant \"silver metallic double-decker layer cake.\" At times, the surface appeared to have a green tinge to it, possibly caused by the sun's reflecting off of it. There was a dome-like structure on top in which a row of four square windows was apparent. Below the windows was a sharp outline which indicated a possibje doorway or opening. Numerous square windows were evenly distributed around the entire perimeter of the object. The outside edge of the object displayed flashing blue arid green lights that could easily be seen in the daylight. Mrs. Hood said the object moved up and down like a yo-yo over the trees for four to five minutes. Suddenly, there was a different, high-pitched \"whoosh type noise\" and the object climbed straight up into the sky and vanished from sight in seconds. After the incident, Mrs. Hood became very nervous. She said she felt as if little bugs were crawling all over her body. • Joe Taylor, a Westmoreland County businessman, reported being chased by a huge unidentified flying object on the night of August 30 not far from the town of Derry. Taylor was driving on Route 217 North when he saw amber lights above his car and realized a huge, solid object was about 40 feet directly above him. It was making a sound which Taylor described as \"whoop-whoop-whoop\" with a very deep bass tone. The sound was so intense that it made his body vibrate from head to toe. Taylor became quite frightened and accelerated to get away from the object, but about 100 yards further 10 Artist's impression of object seen by Tom Jackson down the road, the object appeared once again and hung motionless about 40 feet above the road. Taylor had to pass underneath the object a second time and once again he could hear the sound. Finally, the object made the same maneuver a third time, with Taylor passing under it and beyond. This was the last point at which he saw the object. All three appearances of the object occurred within a quarter-of-a- mile stretch of the road. Taylor described the object as being round, approximately 200 feet or more in diameter and battleship gray in color with a bluish tinge. The bottom was flat, but there was a 40 to 60-foot- square or slightly rectangular area outlined in black, giving him the impression of being a door which could open. There were many lights around the perimeter of the object, each amber in color, giving off a soft bright glow. Each light was about 9 to 13 inches in diameter and they were evenly spaced about four or five feet apart. The lights seemed to be about three feet from the edge of the object. Taylor said that when he was underneath the object, he had a claustrophobic feeling, as though he was being closed in. He said he felt like he was driving into a lighted underground parking garage.

Ron went to a window and saw a large, elongated gray object moving toward the house. The object, which appeared to be about 150 feet long, stopped motionless at rooftop level over a parking lot across from the house. A red light suddenly began flashing on the bottom of the object, and then a white light was beamed down to the ground and moved around as if searching for something. After about two minutes, the white beam of light turned orange and the object then left, moving in the direction from which it had come. It made the humming sound the entire time it was • being observed. Ron said his eyes were itchy while he observed the object.The dogs calmed down once the object left Three times the object hovered over Joe Taylor's car the area. • Jack Orange, who lives in a rural part of Butler County, was pushing his motorcycle into his backyard on the night of September 12 when he noticed a bright white, circular object moving west toward him. He shined his Mrs. Hood saw numerous windows around the perimeter Sketches pages 10 and 11 by Bob McCurry, artist for the Pennsylvania Association for the Study of the Unexplained headlight toward it and the object stopped, motionless, directly over him at a height of about 600 feet. It was very bright and circular and about the size of a house trailer It remained stationary for about two minutes and then rose vertically into the sky heading north. It made a high- pitched sound as it left. Throughout the period of observation, a pet Beagle dog sat looking at the object and whining. . • At 4:30 AM on September 24, a security guard near the city of Indiana observed a huge stationary light hovering about 20 feet above the trees. She said she had been attracted to the object when she heard an unusual, loud noise coming from that direction. The light was the shape of what can best be described as a vertical hot dog about 100 feet long and 30 feet wide. Six beams of light were emitted from the bottom, but during the observation other beams of light appeared from various sections of the object. At one point, blue and green blinking lights were also seen around the structure. At times, the object appeared to actually change shape from the original configuration to a rounded object and then back again. 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"LETTERS: Klass vs. Hall I do not question Richard Hall's inalienabje right as a critic and long-time UFO-proponent to dislike my new book, \"UFOs: The Public Deceived,\" as reported in your August 1983 issue. I only wish to challenge a few errors of fact. In discussing my analysis of the Ohio Army helicopter incident, Hall writes: \"Klass is forced to cope with the information that the UFO was visible for several minutes; one minute would be sufficient to rule out [my hypothesis] a 'fireball.' Hall's claim is denied by time estimates given by the helicopter pilot himself immediately following the incident, as quoted in pages 135-138. Hall is wrong when he charges: \"...he [Klass] repeats an argument that he knows is false: that the green glow flooding the helicopter cockpit is attributable to the green-tinted upper portion of the windshield...\" I relied Upon Coyne's own .account, shortly after the incident, when he said that the light from the object \"came on the upper Plexiglass and flooded the cockpit with green light.\" This \"upper Plexiglass\" to which Coyne referred are the two upper plastic windows atop the cockpit, as shown in Fig. 7 of my book. Hall dismisses the fireball hypothesis saying: \"The conclusive factor is the apparent lack of any reported sightings from adjacent states, which is virtually always the case with [a] prominent fireball...\" A notable exception to Hall's claim is cited in my book (p. 155) which occurred two days after the Army helicopter incident, at 9:07 p.m., roughly two hours earlier when there would have been many more potential ground observers. A United Airlines flight crew flying near Pittsburgh, a large metropolitan area, reported seeing a large fireball, yet there were no other reports either from ground or airborne observers. Reference the Cash-Landrum \"UFO radiation\" incident, my book states: \"Although Schuessler has written several articles on the case over a two-year period, he has never included any details on the health of the two women prior to the alleged 12 incident.\" Hall charges that I am \"miffed because MUFON investigators have refused to allow them access to this sensitive information. It has been and will be made known to proper authorities.\" If both Cash and Landrum were in perfect health prior to the alleged incident, this is hardly \"sensitive information.\" And if one or both did have serious health problems, this deserves to be made public so that all investigators can evaluate its relevance to the claims of \"UFO radiation\" injury. Hall charges that \"he [Klass] bemoans the fact that he isn't [invited to participate in more UFO conferences and programs] throughout the book.\" I challenge Hall to cite, say, five instances in the 310-page book. I did cite two instances of where Dr. Peter Sturrock, who claims to be neutral on the UFO question, had organized symposiums on the subject and noted that he did not invite any experienced UFO-skeptics to participate. Hall claims my book says that \"Keyhoe and Hall at NICAP were too 'conservative' so they were 'replaced' by 'more \"UFOlogically conservative\" Stuart Nixon.' \" Hall calls this \"laughably inaccurate.\" Compare Hall's version of what I wrote with what actually appears on p. 284: \"By the late 1960s, NICAP was in serious financial trouble because of declining membership. Keyhoe and Hall were replaced with persons who proved to be more 'UFOlogically conservative.' Stuart Nixon, who assumed Hall's position, aroused the wrath of many NICAP members when it became known that during a radio interview he had publicly admitted that NICAP lacked proof that UFOs were extraterrestrial and even lacked 'solid proof that something extraordinary occurred.' Nixon soon was replaced.\" [Emphasis added.] I can sympathasize with Hall's disappointment that after spending more than 20 years of his life in UFOlogy, with considerable personal sacrifice, the long search for proof of his convictions has been fruitless. I would predict that Hall, and other UFO- proponents, will never know anything more about \"what UFOs really are\" than they know today. The real tragedy for Hall, and others who continue to \"believe\" in UFOs was summed up a century ago by the famed Louis Pasteur when he wrote: \"The greatest derangement of the mind is to believe in something because one wishes it to be so.\" Philip J. Klass Washington, D.C. Editor, Phil Klass\" response to my review of his book, (No. 186, Aug. 1983) attempts to throw red herrings across the path leading to proof of his culpability as a distorter of evidence. I invite any objective observer to read my review, his response, and — particularly — Jennie Zeidman's report A Helicopter-UFO Encounter Over Ohio* for a personal appraisal of Klass' credibility as a reporter and analyst. Furthermore, I challenge Klass to have the current director of the American Meteor Society read the Zeidman report and offer an independent opinion of the \"fireball\" meteor hypothesis. Klass attempts to make it sound as if I have committed factual errors. I am allegedly wrong in saying that crewmembers saw the green glow through untinted windows of the helicopter. Klass claims to have read the Zeidman report. He must, then, be aware of the following testimony which contradicts his selective citation of data in support of his interpretation: Spec. 5 Robert Yanacsek (p. 28): \"The green light also came through the windshield, which is not tinted.\" Capt. Lawrence J. Coyne (p. 70): \"[The green light also] came through here [front windshield, not tinted].\" Ground witnesses also reported green illumination from the UFO, reaching all the way to the ground, at its closest point to the helicopter (p. 45-47).

I interviewed the witnesses, a man and woman whose names are on file Letters, continued encounter lasted several minutes. As I stated, this militates strongly against a meteor interpretation. I could also rebut his other red herrings, but choose not to do so for the moment, except to . say that his depiction of events at NICAP no longer is \"laughably inaccurate,\" it , is hilariously inaccurate. I will close by saying that the real tragedy for Klass, and others who continue to think that we are simpletons, is their belief that UFOs are nonsense and that we 'have a compulsive will-to-believe. I, for one, have no desire to believe in \"saviors from space\" and, though I am on record as considering the Extraterrestrial Hypothesis as the most likely interpretation, I am most willing to consider alternative hypotheses provided that they confront the reported facts fairly and objectively.

' At 9:15 that evening, the two witnesses were sitting on the front porch of the woman's house, enjoying the night air, when the woman became aware of something passing over the house from the east. She told her friend and both saw what they described as a triangular-shaped object. The man described it as one of those \"old flying wings.\" He said it was covered with a myriad of small, off-white colored lights on the underside and along the edges, \"like miniature Christmas tree lights.\" The woman thought the lights were light orange in color. Twenty to 30 of the lights were centered in a cluster on the underside of the object, and eight or nine were arranged around the edges. None of the lights had a distinct shape but seemed to vary in intensity like what one of the witnesses • called \"heat fumes\" (heat waves?), giving the impression the object was changing shape although the male witness did not believe it was. No distinguishing marks were noted. The object was silent, although a freeway 300 yards away could, have masked any possible sound. As the object headed,west and toward a lighted football stadium, where a game was in progress, it suddenly \"stood completely up on edge\" and banked, making : a sharp 90- degree turn, and went south, vanishing behind a stand of trees. The total sighting time was estimated at 15 seconds. On the night of the Perseid meteor shower several days later, August 11, both witnesses were in the backyard of the house, when the woman again noted the object, this time about a mile to the north, traveling west to east. She called the man's attention to it and he also saw it! The object flew in such a manner that the same lights were once again seen on the underside. After four seconds or so, the object vanished behind some intervening trees. The male witness estimated the apparent size of. the object as that of several 8 l / 2 by 11 sheets of paper held at arm's length. He said the object was large and traveled \"awful fast.\" The trees are about half a mile from the house. The Walla Walla airport reported a crop-dusting plane may have been in the area, but it seems unlikely it would have been operating over a residental neighborhood. Neither the county sheriff or state patrol offices reported any sightings on those dates. The obvious problem here is the short duration of the sightings, especially the second one. However, I was struck by the impression the sightings made on the witnesses. The woman was upset by the first sighting, while the banking maneuver of the object, when it stood on edge, deeply impressed the male. 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The danger in asking questions prematurely UNRELIABLE WITNESSES By PAOLO TOSELLI Allessandria, Italy , \"I saw it with my own eyes!\" How many times have we listened to this statement designed to avoid doubt, to reinforce certitude? Usually, but erroneously, one believes that the witness is a perfect recording apparatus, that all that passes before his eyes is recorded and may be plainly reproduced through well contrived questions. Numerous experiments show, however, that testimony is remarkably subject to error. In order to discuss something as controversial as UFOs, it is first important to realize that the eyewitness is as much a part of the event as is the physical stimulus that led to the personal experience. In fact, an objective stimulus seems to be there in the first place of a UFO experience, but the whole thing is channeled through our own personalities and comes out as an experience with greater or lesser \"subjectivity\" elements. Perception is not just a simple reproduction of what we see. Some psychologists have argued that in order to comprehend an event that we witness, various aspects of the event must be interpreted by us. Only part of this interpretation is based upon the environmental input that gave rise to it; that is, only part comes from our actual perception of an event. Another part is based on prior \"memory\" or existing knowledge, and a third part is inference. As remarked by Haines, \"in an honest attempt to reduce the emotional and intellectual uncertainty which inevitably accompanies a novel experience, the witness may add certain types of percepts from his memory and/or delete other types; this helps reconcile the often unreal qualtiy of the original percepts with an acceptable, reality-based, final perception. For instance, (....) a UFO 14 witness may add certain visual details gleaned from his imagination or memory. The addition of these details usually makes the object he describes appear more similar to objects he believes others have reported. Thus, what may originally have been the perception of a vague, greenish haze seen hovering silently above an open field late at night, may be reported as a well-defined, light green object which flew slowly and evenly over the field without making a sound.\" 1 Another process influencing the responses that will be made to an ambiguous, novel (unknown) event is the psychological predisposition (also known as \"set\") of the witness. Many times the concept of \"set\" is expressed in the psychological literature with the terms of \"hypothesis/' \"expectation,\" \"meaning,\" \"attitude\"; they are quite similar terms emphasizing the .general concept that a person is prepared or syntonized to receive some kinds of information; so the perception depends on set and stimulus interaction. Ron Westrum, in a paper on UFO witnesses, touches upon this matter. \"A considerable folklore has grown up around UFOs, as I discovered to my surprise — he writes — in the course of making investigation of UFO sightings. (...) This folklore tends to set up an expectation that certain kinds of things will be seen or will happen during a UFO experience and this affects not only what the witness feels he ought to relate to others, but also what the witness remembers as happening.\" 2 The question of \"mental set\" is especially important to consider when dealing with certain UFO/IFO cases. Because so little data exists, the distortion of only one factor can make an identifiable object apparently unidentifiable. An example of the \"mental set\" effect is supplied us by Philip Morrison. It is the case of three radio astronomers; one of these was a friend of Morrison, who stood outside Washington, D.C., some years ago watching a large cigar-shaped object in the air, perfectly silent, with visible lighted windows, moving very rapidly past them. \"Independently, they told each other they had each certainly seen the most remarkable kind of unidentified flying object. Suddenly the wind changed, and aircraft engines were heard; the distance adjusted itself, and they recognized they were seeing an ordinary airliner, much nearer than they had thought but not audible because of some peculiar sonic refraction of the wind. A change of the perceptual set changed their entire view of the phenomenon.\" 3 When we experience an event, we do not simply record that event in memory as a videotape recorder would. The situation is much more complex. Usually, we don't retain the pure experience, but we elaborate before storing it. In fact, we store in memory not the environmental input itself, nor even a copy or a partial copy, but only fragments of the interpretation that we gave to the input when we experience it. A vivid, detailed photographic resurrection of the part is not the most efficient way to remember. Memories of everyday events are more similar to a syllogism than to a photograph; usually we go gradually towards the past and only seldom do we recall it as a \"snapshot.\" A grown-up person usually uses (verbal) symbols, to organize his memory in such a way as to find what he needs. We constantly translate our experiences by means of intervening symbols, store them in our memory and recover them instead of our original experience. When we have to (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Toselli, continued remember, we try to reconstruct the experience from the symbols. Research indicates the experi- ences people remember about an event are influenced by the label associated with the event. Labels are not neutral, they carry explicit and implicit stimuli previously associated with them. As remarked by Michael Persinger: \"A confounding interaction arises when one uses a label which is already heavily 'loaded' with emotionally-laden associations. For example, suppose an observer sees a pulsating luminous light with dark stimuli moving within it. If the person labels the observation as a landed UFO, then the observation is no, longer 'neutral' since the previously learned associations of the word UFO may now contaminate the observation. The operation of this process could result in a report like: \"I saw a UFO landed on the hill, it was slowly materializing and de-materializing, and there were aliens moving within'.\" 4 People's memories are fragile things. The tendency to invent or to introduce new material taken from a different structure can increase considerably with the passage of time. External information provided from the outside can intrude into the witness's memory, as .can his own thoughts, and both can cause dramatic changes in his recollection. Usually, this happens when witnesses to an event later read or hear something about it and are subsequently asked to recall the event. Postevent information cannot only enhance existing memories but also change a witness's memory and even cause non-existent details to become incorporated into a previously acquired memory. 5 Many peopje believe that their memories are absolute and constant. But/ contrary to apparent popular belief, the evidence in no way .confirms the views that all memories are permanent and thus potentially recoverable. , A witness's confidence in his memories and the accuracy of his 1 memories often have little correlation. People are often confident and right, but they can also be confident and wrong. To be cautious, one should not take high confidence as any absolute guarantee of anything. Memory isn't the only place where' the recognition processes can go on the wrong track. Many psychologists think that the main errors and misunder- standings depend on the retrieval processes. The conditions prevailing at the time information is retrieved from memory are critically important in determining the accuracy and completeness .of an eyewitness 1 account. Reporting is one of the most crucial factors in the UFO problem. There are numerous ways to influence (and often drastically distort) the recollection of a witness. The manner in which a question is phrased and the assumption it makes have profound effects on the accuracy and quantity of eyewitness testimony. By using leading questions, for example, an attorney can \"shape\" the testimony of any eyewitness. A leading question is simply one that by its form or content suggests to a witness what answer is .desired or leads him to. the desired answer. We all probably ask leading questions without realizing we are doing so. Dr. Elizabeth Loftus, an Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Washington in Seattle, has demonstrated how altering the semantic value of the words • in questions about a filmed auto accident causes witnesses to distort their reports. 6 When witnesses were asked a question using the word \"smashed\" as opposed to \"bumped\" they gave higher estimates of speed and were more likely to report having seen broken glass — although there was not broken glass. To summarize the issues involved in question type and . structure of testimony, the notion of cognitive set, defined in terms of the specificity of the questioning situation, is a useful tool and also helps to illustrate the negative correlation between accuracy and quantity of testimony. When giving unstructured testimony (i.e., free elaboration without the use of any questioning) the witnesses' cognitive set is under the least restraint, and witnesses are likely to give only \"testimony about which they are somewhat certain, causing accuracy to be high and quantity low. As the questioning becomes more and more specific, cognitive set becomes directed and narrow, accuracy decreases, and quantity increases. The studies in this area indicate, then, that the witness should first be allowed to report freely, or in a controlled narrative fashion. This free report can be followed by a series of very specific questions so as to increase the range or coverage of the witness's report. On the contrary, asking specific questions before the narrative can be dangerous because information contained in those questions can become a part of the free report, even when the information is wrong. Summing up, the reported testimony — viz.,the UFO report — on which we are bound to work is conditioned by many .facts that affect the observation and reporting of an event, whose effect nevertheless we aren't able to quantify and estimate a posteriori. It is essential, therefore, that UFO .investigators recognize the factors that might influence how well a person perceives, remembers, and reports an event. The purpose of this paper is to represent an invitation to probe the numerous problems involved in dealing with eyewitnesses. REFERENCES 1. Haines, Richard F.

On Route 701 about four miles from her home, just as she was approaching the intersection with Route 692, she noticed a green light about 30 to 40 feet above a field directly ahead of her. She pulled up to a stop sign, came to a complete stop, and shifted into parking gear. As she reached to turn her radio off, she heard the announcer say it was 11:10 PM. \"That's when I noticed the whole object,\" Ms. Larose told MUFON investigators. \"I didn't know what to think. I thought at first it was some new helicopter or aircraft belonging to NASA or the Air Force.\" NASA's Wallops Island rocket- launching facilities are nearby. She said the moonlight gave the object a grayish- silver reflection. At this time she noticed a bright shaft of light was shining down on the field, as if searching for something. \"Then I realized there was no loud noise you should hear from a helicopter or aircraft, and it sure wouldn't just stand in mid-air with a beam of light directed to the ground.\" The object was circular, she said, with two green lights, one on each side, and two red lights, one between each green light and the center of the object. She said the center, perhaps a window or bubble similar to those found on helicopters, was illuminated by a soft- white interior light. \"As I was watching the lighted area, I noticed three dark shadows moving about,\" she said. She said the three silhouettes were human-like and were visible from the waist up. \"I was afraid but my curiosity was greater and I had to stay there and see what it was going to do,\" Ms. Larose said. She didn't have long to wait. When she stopped at the stop sign, she had left her headlights on and they were shining almost directly at the object, which was then still above a field on the opposite side of Route 692 from the stop sign. \"A few seconds passed and the beam of light disappeared,\" said Ms. Larose. \"The object then raised up to tree-top level and started moving slowly toward my car. I just kept watching. Finally, it went right over the top of the car. I was shaking when that thing went over. \"The bottom was black. I couldn't see the sky because the object obstructed the view. It had a humming sound to it like a generator.\" The humming noise drowned out all other sounds as it passed over, she said. \"I stayed there and watched it disappear in the woods behind me. It was going northwest, toward the bay.\" She looked at her watch and saw that about seven minutes had passed. She drove on to work, arriving at 12:05 AM. Later, she phoned the Washington Air Route Traffic Control Center in Leesburg, Virginia, but was just given the phone number of the UFO Reporting Center in Seattle, Washington. Ms. Larose said her car's engine and lights continued operating normally throughout the incident, and she heard no static on the radio before turning it off. She also said she did not experience any unusual physical sensations as the object passed over her vehicle. The object was larger than the car, but she gave no estimate of its size. Ms. Larose, who appears to be an intelligent and honest person, said she had read a little about UFOs and feels certain she saw one that evening. 16"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Australian researches ET space technology By JOHN F. SCHUESSLER Mr. Stan Deyo, an American research physicist now living in Perth, Australia, believes he is on the verge of a breakthrough in .aerospace propulsion. Although controversial, his work finds its basis in solid scientific theory; coupled with observed effects from a number of credible UFO cases, government research project results, and data exchanges with a number of researchs in various countries. Perth is jokingly referred to as the other side of Earth; but the work being conducted by Mr. Deyo at Tesla Research Industries, or TRI for short, is no joke. This writer met with Mr. Deyo and other participants at TRI to examine their data base and review films of recent experiments. I was impressed by their dedication, professionalism, and will to succeed. Tesla Research Industries was formed for the purpose of conducting electrical propulsion research in Australia. However, Mr. Deyo bagan several years earlier in America in his quest for the ultimate propulsion scheme — antigravity. He said: \"my interests in the United States were to develop a propulsion system for our government that would fly just as it was reported: ,UFOs flew.\" In the twelve years since he left Texas he has made significant progress. A number of UFO researchers have been intrigued by the reported antics of UFOs and have tried to define their propulsion concepts in layman's terms. Usually, although interesting, their systems appear more like flights of fancy, rather than flights of machines. Mr. Deyo has not allowed himself to fall into that trap. Instead, he has concentrated on the technology necessary to define a \"better machine.\" An initial question that required an answer was \"will a disc-shaped vehicle really fly?\" The affirmative answer to that question came from the flight test results gained from the Avrocar program in 1960 and 1961. The Avrocar, manufactured by Avro Aircraft, Limited, in Canada, was an unconventional aircraft powered by three J69-T-9 jet engines. It was an 18 foot diameter disc, designated a Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) aircraft, that predated the modern Harrier VTOL by several years. Flight test reports and films were used to evaluate the flying qualities of the disc. Although the nearly three ton Avrocar had some stability problems and marginal power, it did fly. Unfortunately, it never achieved the design goal of 200 mph at 10,000 foot altitude. Being interested in magnetohydro- dynamic (MHD) propulsion rather than the continued use of jet engines was a real plus for Deyo. As he and the TRI team reviewed the films of the Avrocar test flights they discovered a segment of film that was more revealing than wind tunnel data. As the disc flew across a snow covered area the downward thrust of the jet engines forced the snow to swirl back up around the disc in an unusual flow pattern. By inverting the film one could see how an MHD vehicle constructed like the Avrocar, but placed in an inverted orientation could have the proper flight characteristics to duplicate some of the reported UFO incidents. Next, Deyo collected a significant data bank covering the works of Dr. Nikola Tesla of Yugoslavia. Tesla held more than 900 patents and invented the AC generating systems we have today, according to Deyo. Even more important to the propulsion issue was the remote-controlled submarine Tesla presented to the U.S. Navy in 1905. Deyo has studied the details of the Tesla patents and built a large Tesla coil for use in his own laboratory research. Movies of that phase of Deyo's work showed some effects that could relate to futuristic propulsion devices. Also demonstrated was the need for well defined safety rules and the screening of project personnel. The work of Dr. Thomas Townsend-Brown, famous during the 1950's in the United States for trying to build a real flying saucer, was carefully scrutinized for details that could add to the success of the TRI project. According to Brown's original patent specification his invention \"relates to a method of controlling gravitation and for deriving power therefrom, and to a method of producing linear force or motion. The method is fundamentally electrical.\" Deyo understood those words to be basic to the goals of his project. Once the historical data base was in place the works of other inventors were added. Notebooks from the Bahnson Company, along with laboratory films and photographs; Bill Moore's claims of the reality of the Philadelphia Experiment; Aerodynamic plasma propulsion test reports; MHD craft patents; nuclear rocket program details; and the electromagnetic- submarine test results all combined for serendipity. Mr. Deyo is not only a visionary scientist, he has been called a \"computer whiz.\" He has utilized his computer to pull the common characteristics from the historical data and manipulate that information in various ways to refine his propulsion concepts. He has begun to focus on the Lorentz force phenomena. By using super-conducting toroidal coils he believes he is only a step away from building a test model capable of free flight. He has named his vehicle the LORENTZ-O. When I questioned whether or not the world is ready for the LORENTZ-O, he replied: \"It just may be mandatory,\" and proceeded to reveal a keen insight into the world political and social issues. To circumvent the problem of pitting one country against another, he is releasing his project results to the public on a continuing basis. In that way, perhaps the world can make a peaceful entrance to the twenty-first century. A scientist in Melbourne contacted me to scoff at the possibility of the Deyo Project success. Under questioning, this scientist admitted he had not (continued on next page) 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Director's Message, continued Ph.D. in physics at Kyung-pook University in Daegu, Korea, and holds amateur radio license HL5IZ. The following new State Section Directors, some of whom have been MUFON members for many years, have been selected: Gordon Kellander, Fairmont, Minnesota, for Martin County; Grant Callison, Galesburg, Illinois, for Knox and Warren Counties; Mrs. Gayle Treadwell, Beeville, Texas, for Bee County; and Joseph S. Haas, Jr., Ashland, New Hampshire, for Grafton County. Mr. Kellander, Mr. Callison and Mr. Haas all attended the recent conference at the University of Nebraska, where we had several enjoyable visits. It is a pleasure to welcome two new Consultants to MUFON's Advisory Board, headed by James M. McCampbell, Director for Research. Richard M. Neal, M.D., a speaker at the MUFON 1983 UFO Symposium is Pasadena and residing in Lawndale, California, is a Consultant in Physiological and Psychological Effects. Dr. Neal is specializing in the medical aspects suffered by individuals in close encounter cases. Samuel D. Greco, Ph.D., an aerospace engineer with a variety of related degrees and living in Aston, Pennsylvania, has volunteered as a Consultant in Propulsion. John Prytz, a librarian with a Graduate Diploma, hailing from Curtin, A.C.T., Australia, and a frequent writer for the Journal, becomes a Research Specialist. Eric Jacobson (Master of Education in Counseling), from Arlington, Massachusetts, has been recommended by Mrs. Marge Christensen to be a Research Specialist in psychological, sociological, and physiological factors which contribute to UFO experiences. And speaking of Marge Christensen, we are all indebted to her for publishing and mailing the MUFON Newsletter to the State Directors. Her December newsletter will contain information taken from this \"Director's Message\" so that it will be current. Several State Directors have already responded to the letter and list of former subscribers to Frontiers of 18 Science, inviting them to join MUFON and to participate in State meetings and activities. Leonard W. Sturm, State Director for Illinois, and Dan Wright, State Director for Michigan, have shared copies of their letters with the Director. Leonard has consistently sent personalized letters of welcome to new members in Illinois for a number of years. We recommend this procedure as a means of building a State organization. In order to squelch any remor that may have started, the financial health of the Arcturus Book Service, 263 North Ballston Avenue, Scotia, NY 12302, is not in need of medical attention. Bob Girard recently placed a fresh order with MUFON for all of our publications to replenish his stock. Bob is providing a much needed service to Ufologists through the operation of his book store. He not only sells UFO related books, but purchases books of entire personal libraries to make many of the out-of- print editions available to his customers. Mr. Girard periodically publishes a catalog of books in his stock. We heartily recommend Bob's book service to our Journal readers as one of the finest. In spite of his busy schedule, Richard H. Hall, former editor of the Journal, is continuing to submit material for publication. Dick has volunteered to specialize in countering the skeptics. He would accept the responsibility of ensuring that skeptical views published in the Journal would receive a prompt and adequate answer. At the same time, he could pursue the goal of \"reasoned debate\" between proponents and skeptics. He feels that being a critic of the skeptical viewpoint better fits his true beliefs. Your Director is confident that Mr. Hall can contribute a valuable service to Ufology in this capacity. During his attendance at the Nebraska Conference, Dennis B. Pursel, M.D., from Munster, Indiana, presented a generous donation to MUFON to further our work. May we express our public gratitude to Dr. Pursel for his appreciated gift. The Journal does not accept advertising; however we do publicize books authored by members. John Magor's much delayed book titled Aliens Above, Always is now available from CUFOR books, P.O.

Witnesses claim that technicians from Argentina's Atomic Energy Commission recovered fragments of the object. The October 11 issue tells of a UFO landing in France, leaving traces that defied explanation by the French government's study group, GEPAN. The October 18 issue of THE STAR reported on the landing of a UFO just outside a U.S. Air Force base at RAF Bentwaters in England. An estimated 200 base personnel allegedly saw the object. The \"Anti-Matter/UFO Update\" column in the November OMNI reports on the claims of Wyoming rancher Pat McGuire, detailing his stories of various contacts with UFO occupants. The column in the September issue reported on the March 1983 sightings in New York State, which were so widely publicized. UFO cults and deprogramming procedures were discussed in the October issue. The recently formed Society for Scientific Exploration is the subject of an article by Patrick Huyghe in the December issue of SCIENCE DIGEST. The SSE, whose members are interested in all aspects of the unexplained, was founded by Dr. Peter Sturrock, professor of space science and astrophysics at Stanford University. Dr. Sturrock's special interest is UFOs. Dr. Bruce Maccabee contributes an excellent, detailed review of Philip J. Klass' new book, UFOs: THE PUBLIC DECEIVED, in the November issue of FATE. In providing examples of Klass' inaccurate and misleading arguments, Maccabee suggests that the public will certainly be deceived if the contents of the book are considered the final word on the subject.

Commendations are to be bestowed upon the following people for their planning and implementation of this very professionally manged conference: Ray W. Boeche, organizer and MUFON State Director for Nebraska; Russ Free, Coordinator and Robert A. Mortenson, Director of Conferences and Institutes, University of Nebraska; and Mr. Boeche's team of investigators, including Scott Colburn, State Section Director. The format of the conference provided adequate opportunity for the participants to secure answers to their questions from the speakers. The outstanding cadre of speakers — composed of Tom Adams, Larry Arnold, Loren Coleman, Larry Fawcett, Budd Hopkins, Linda Moulton Howe, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Dr. Roy Mackal, John Schuessler, Ray Boeche, and Walter Andrus — were the keys to the success of this educational, interesting and exciting conference. Several of these speakers are scheduled for the MUFON 1984 UFO Symposium in Dallas, Texas, on June 8,9 and 10. Bob Pratt, Editor, has prepared articles in this issue of the Journal depicting some of the new material presented. News coverage by the wire services, newspapers, radio and television stations and network TV proved beyond doubt that the subject of UFOs is newsworthy and in great demand by the general public. The MUFON photo exhibit and banner in the Conference Center lobby was the backdrop for all of the television interviews. Cassette tape recordings of individual speakers are available from two sources for $5.00 each. The University of Nebraska sales should be addressed to and checks made payable RAY W. BOECHE to Ericon, Inc., 13468 Arnold, Redford, MI 48239. MUFON will also accept orders for the tape recordings by writing and making checks payable to MUFON, 103 Oldtowne Road, Seguin, TX 78155, specifying the name of the speaker and the quantity of tapes for each speaker. Wayne Erickson, a MUFON member, has contracted to reproduce the tapes and make a small donation to both the University of Nebraska and the Mutual UFO Network from the profits. * * * Upon receipt of the conference brochure mailed to Journal subscribers, in August, Philip Klass placed telephone calls to Russ Free, Conference Coordinator, Robert A. Mortenson, Director, Conferences and Institutes, and the Chancellor of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln vehemently complaining and demanding why a prestigious university would sponsor such a Conference. Phil became so obnoxious on the telephone that neither Russ Free nor Bob Mortenson could reason with him. (Both gentlemen shared this information with your Director personally.) Phil's blatant call to the Chancellor prompted an investigation and interviews with the other recipients by Dr. John K. Yost, Assistant to the Chancellor. To provide an insight into the extremes that Mr. Klass will take to criticize people and to thrust his personal views upon people, I quote one paragraph from a letter dated August 23, 1983, to Dr. Yost from Mortenson: \"/ talked at length with Mr. Phillip Klass of Washington, D.C. this afternoon. Mr. Klass is a member of the Committee for the Scientific Investigations of Claims of the Paranormal. This committee has a much different view of unexplained phenomena than those groups we are working with as sponsors of this conference. He was, in fact, quite adamant in his position regarding the credibility of the conference presenters. Further, Mr. Klass has a personal feeling that the nature of this conference seriously questions the integrity of the United States Government. He feels that there is no scientific evidence to support the claims of the presenters and indicated that these organizations, by publicly questioning the government, lend support to the Communist movement.\" In addition to the letter, I have a copy of five pages of notes taken during the actual telephone conversations in which Phil also attempts to promote his personal credibility to the university personnel. Russ Free, in the initial telephone call, was disturbed when Phil Klass introduced himself as \"a free- lance writer with an interest in such phenomena\" and properly identifying himself only later. Obviously, the conference took place as scheduled in spite of Phil Klass' attempts to undermine both the presenters and the university. This is concrete evidence that Mr. Klass will use any means within his power to attack people and institutions who do not share his personal beliefs. Are these the actions of a person suffering from desperation? * * * Mr. Chung Chan-ik has been appointed our Representative for Korea at the recommendation of Thomas L.
