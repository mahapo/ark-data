FROM THE EDITOR Ufology lost not only a founding father but a friend when Dr. J. Allen Hynek passed away at the end of April. I knew him neither as long nor as well as many of you, yet I found Dr. Hynek invariably patient and considerate, willing to give of his time and energy when the demands put on either would have strained any man half his age and less gifted with enthusiasm for his life's work. He was indefatigable, but alas, not indestructible. News of his death came just as we were going to press. No doubt more tributes and memories of the man will appear in the future. In the meantime, this issue of the Journal is respectfully dedicated to the late Dr. J. Allen Hynek, now outward bound on the Closest Encounter of them all, that of a man with his Maker.

Allen Hynek (1910 - 1986) THE NEW YORK TIMES, THURSDAY, MAY 1, 1986 J. Allen Hynek, Astronomer And U.F.O. Consultant, Dies By JOAN COOK J. Allen Hynek. an astrophysicist and consultant to an Air Force project to assess reports of unidentified flying ob- jects, died of a malignant brain tumor Sunday at Memorial Hospital in Scotts- dale, Ariz. He was 75 years old. Dr. Hynek, who moved to Scottsdale from Evanston, 111., a year ago, was for 18 years professor and chairman of the Department of Astronomy at North- western University and director of its Dearborn Observatory, until he retired in 1978. He was involved in the Air Force U.F.O. research effort from 1948 to 1969. Often his task for the Air Force was to examine at first hand more substan- tial reports of flying saucers and the like. In 1966, after a rash of sightings in Michigan, he went to the area to take charge of the investigation. After inter- viewing scores of people, he ascribed certain sightings to luminous marsh gas rather that something from space. Nevertheless, he said, \"Scientists in the year 2066 may think us very naive in our denials.\" He long asserted that U.F.O.'s should be taken seriously and he eventually became.displeased with the Air Force approach. He said that its methods were slipshod and that it was not con- ducting a scientific study. The Air Force, in turn, concluded that there was no evidence of extraterrestial craft and the U.F.O. project was abandoned. He Avoids 'UF.O. Nut' Label In an interview in 1974, Dr. Hynek said (hat he had remained with the pro- gram as long as he did to retain access to Air Force data and to avoid being marked a \"U.F.O. nut.\" Dr. Hynek founded the Center for U.F.O. Studies in Evanston in 1973 and took it with him when he moved to Scottsdale. He is credited with coining the phrase \"close encounters of the third kind\" to describe humans meeting creatures from space. He used the phrase in his 1972 book \"The U.F.O. Experience\" and it became the title of the 1977 Steven Spielberg film, on which he served as technical adviser. When a reporter once suggested that Dr. Hynek he might be remembered not as an astromer but as the man who made U.F.O.'s respectable, he replied: \"I wouldn't mind. If I can succeed in making the study of U.F.O.*s scientifi- cally respectable and do something constructive in it, then I think that would be a real contribution.\" He resigned from the center he founded a few months ago for ill health, according to the director, Tina Choate. He Worked on Proximity Fuse In World War II, Dr. Hynek was a civilian scientist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Science Laboratory, where he helped to develop the Navy's radio proximity fuze. Josef Allen Hynek was bom In Chi- cago, 111., to Czechoslovak parents. He graduated from the University of Chi- cago in 1931 and earned a Ph.D degree there in 1935. He joined the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Ohio State in 1936. After the war he returned there, rising to full professor in 1950. In 1956 he left to join Prof. Fred Whipple, the Harvard astronomer, at the SroiUisonian Astrophysical Observ- atory, which had combined with the Harvard Observatory at Harvard. Dr. Hynek had the assignment of directing the tracking of an American space satellite, a project for the International Geophysical Year In 1956 and there- after. In addition to 247 optical stations around the world, there were to be 12 photographic stations. A special cam- era was devised for the task and a The New York Times J.Allen Hynek prototype was built and tested and then stripped apart again when, on Oct. 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched its first satellite, Sputnik. Assumed the U.S Would Be First \"We had always assumed that the Unied States would have the first satel- lite,\" Dr. Hynek said ruefully at the time. \"If I've ever had a traumatic ex- perience, that was it.\" Observations of the Soviet satellite were received, and with twice-daily news conferences. Dr. Hynek and Dr. Whipple began to reassure the public after what Dr. Hynek called \"this intel- lectual Pearl Harbor, a real gutsy sock to the stomach.\" Once things in satellite tracking set- tled down to a routine, Dr. Hynek went back to teaching, taking the chairman- ship at Northweatern in 1960. He is survived by his wife, the former Mlria.T, Curtis; four sons and a daugh- ter, Scott Josef, of Waltham, Mass.; Joel Curtis, of Leonia, N.J., Paul Cur- tis, of Scottsdale, Ross Allen, of Lake Forest, 111., Roxane. of- Hanover, Mass.; and five grandchildren."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"UFO ACTIVITY OVER OHIO By Irena Scott Irena Scott, Ph.D., is a MUFON field investigator and consultant in physiology. In spring 1984 several, possible UFO sightings occurred in the Columbus, .Ohio, area. J learned of this first sighting from a local newspaper article. On 18 May, 1984, at 9:35 PM, two witnesses saw a flash of light as though from a large flash camera. One witness, a retired Army colonel, said the flash \"was followed by a jet-like rocket propellant, which .was a bright white rocket exhaust for just a split second. At that time a long (approximately 12') rocket-like vehicle proceeded in a westerly direction, tree- top high on a gradual descent path.\" He saw a black .object that he believed was around 125 feet from him. On July 30, he reported the sighting to the police, because on July 27, a Russian rocket had fallen from space and he thought the object he had seen might have been falling space debris. Both witnesses (the other witness was a nurse) described a streak-shape having a west or northwest trajectory. It appeared several times larger in apparent diameter than the moon. They both thought the object might have come down just over a hillside from them. I checked with the neighbors, who owned this property, but no one had noticed a disturbance. A check with the power company showed no disturbance, there was no record of falling space debris, and no one knew of anyone shooting rockets or firecrackers at that time. The people lived near a resort area close to two airports and were familiar with landing lights, ultra-light air craft, balloons, meteors, and astronomical objects and did not believe they had seen a conventional object. The weather had been clear. FRIGHTENED Artist's impression superimposed over site of reported sighting. In order to gather additional information, I asked other neighbors and discovered several other possible sightings. Another had taken place approximately 0.4 miles to the southeast on a Tuesday in April, 1984. The witness (a retired accountant) said, \"I saw a red flashing light in the sky; about the time some trees cut out my view, so I kept driving and then I saw it again. It was a very large, round object. It appeared overhead in the sky about tree top-high with amber lights all around it and the rest of it was quite red all over. It kept coming closer so I stopped the car and turned off the radio, and just looked at it because I was frightened and thought that it was going to land in the road in front of me.\" She said that it was traveling very slowly and all at once it disappeared. Judging by the trees behind the object she believed it had descended to 20 feet elevation and disappeared when it was around 80 feet away from her. The object was a sphere with amber rays projecting from lights around its periphery and it appeared to be approximately 10 times the moon's apparent diameter. She kept watching for it as she drove home and, upon arrival, dashed into the house. She continues to feel creepy when she drives by the area at night (1986). However, she did not tell anyone about the observation, because her husband had told her not to talk about it. Several other possible UFO sightings were reported within 15 miles of these sightings during the spring. One of these occurred on February 23, 1984 at approximately 4:00 to 4:25 PM. (continued next page,)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"OHIO, continued This sighting was by five highly educated witnesses and was over Columbus, Ohio. The object's appearance underwent a regular change (possible rotation) approxi- mately every 60 seconds from an upside-down ice cream cone to a rectangle. No circular or balloon- shaped component was visible above it and it appeared to have traveled 5-10 miles during the period of observation. It was first sighted over the Ohio State University and, traveled to the northeast. It appeared higher in elevation than the aircraft leaving Port Columbus airport, but otherwise its elevation could not be determined. An investigator, Warren Nicholson, said that in checking with Port Columbus (east of the sighting .location) immediately after the sighting, he found that the ground wind speed was 0 and that the airport radar had not detected anything. CONTRAILS Later that evening, Mr. Nicholson said that he received a report from a highly credible witness and his family about a group of four objects (over west Columbus, Ohio) that appeared as black contrails and then flew away in different direction's. An attempt was made to photograph one of the objects. The next week, February 29, 1985, at around 3:30 PM, a witness sighted ' an amorphous black-brown object around 1-2 feet in diameter, briefly hovering close to the roof of a building near the Ohio State University campus, that rapidly flew to the southeast. Around the times of these sightings some possible poltergeist activity occurred. In March, 1984, approximately 0.8 mile from the red sphere sighting location, a woman's neighbor called to ask if she were all right because, \"there's a man walking down the road. He had been walking back and forth (repetitively) across another neighbor's driveway on the opposite side of the road and next door to her. He then started walking down the road and as he passed my house, would take a few steps, stop and look in at my house (repetitively), then continue until he passed by the house.\" She rushed to her picture window (that has a good view of both ways of the road) and was unable to see anyone. The following morning after a fresh snowfall, she found a man's tracks in her yard, which started in the middle of her yard about 20 feet from the road, walked up to her doorstep and stopped, with no tracks leading to or away from them. She had lived there for around 30 years and nothing like this had happened to her previously. She knew of no reason why anyone would play jokes on her. Also, the controversial \"Columbus Poltergeist\" activity began on March 3, 1984. BURN-MARK Another interesting event, althought it was not correlated with a UFO sighting and was investigated only as an unidentified burn, was'a roughly 130-foot by 6-foot elliptical burn that made a sudden appearance in an isolated field of knee-high, green alfalfa about 0.8 mile northwest of the location of the rocket sighting. The farmer, who discovered it in early June,'1984, had reported it to the fire department, asking if it could have been caused by a helicopter. It was unusual in that no tracks were found near the area, the field had been planted in alfalfa the previous years and had grown normally, and nothing had been applied to the area. This was not an ordinary grass fire because June was a wet month with water standing in the field and special equipment would have been required to burn the alfalfa. It must have its water vaporized first. I had the soil analyzed by mass spectronometry. Neither the biochemist, who did the analysis, nor the soil scientists, who examined the chromatograms, found any trace of herbicide, pesticide, or gasoline. The following spring, an unusually large proportion of the dandelions that grew in the area were thick-stemmed. Some looked as if five or more stems had grown together to make one stalk. These stalks lay along the ground rather than standing as dandelions normally do. The trace remains visible (1986). All the witnesses were reliable, well-educated people, who were used to being out-of-doors. Since several of these sightings were over Columbus, Ohio, one wonders how to get other witnesses to report sightings. Also, if investigators were able to obtain enough reports, they might be able to examine possible relationships between reported poltergeist activity and reported UFO sightings. Jennie Zeldman's assistance in this investigation was very much appreciated.

Reddy Mr. Reddy is a research specialist who joined MUFON in 1983. This is his first article for the Journal. A question damaging to the opposition of the ET theory is, If we have no visitors from the stars, why not? Consider the near certainty of hundreds of billions of planets in our galaxy alone, the evidence and arguments for the widespread distribution of life, and the probably billions of years that civilizations evolved on the planets would have had by this time to propagate throughout the Milky Way, utilizing intelligence and technology that presumably would have become ever more extremely advanced. Why has such alien intelligence not colonized all of the planetary systems, including ours, arid indeed refashioned the universe? • . • To address the question, firstly, we should realize that not all scientific feats loosely conceivable are necessarily physically possible. Time travel into the past is almost certainly not, as it would permit the traveler to change-events which had to occur as they did in order that the world of the present be as it is-, a logical contradiction. This likely impossibility is but one of many that together may create a general lirhitedness of science, technology- and space travel. (At a level which, however, may be far above our modern attainment.) Another major always- inviolable limitation may well be the speed of light. LIMITATIONS The various inherent limits to science and technology, if they exist, could be approached but not exceeded no matter how old our or any other civilization becomes. And, if technology does advance within an overall limit, a question arises as to how far above the present human level innate intelligence capacity might evolve or whether ; it would evolve further at all. It too might come to a maximum, with computers doing the noncreative brainwork. Such an idea of limitation is not new, and may seem to have been discredited by the surpassing of some supposedly established limits. Nonetheless it may turn out to be truer than notions of fan-out possibilities realizable- sometime or somewhere, .or truer than extreme extrapolations of present trends of progress. Perhaps indicatively, most biological species have ended their upward evolution. Immediately this could explain why ET civilizations have not swamped and revamped the universe. It is the/irsf reason, within the present theory, why that has not occurred. A few years ago I wrote an article explaining that the most advanced ET civilization may not be as far beyond us as one might infer, presuming it had an eons-earlier starting date, for a different reason than that just stated. 1 This is: Probably, life in the universe and especially within galaxies began and evolved with some degree of concurrency, owing to an interconnect- edness. Organic chemicals produced and evolved to some extent in space, and wafted .by gaseous currents, starlight, and gravity, might have established the first life or stimulated life on planets all around our galaxy at about the same time. Then, as life developed .on the planets, complex organic molecules or even actual spores might have begun to escape into space, bringing about a still-continuing interchange of genetic material throughout the galaxy, accelerating the evolution of less-developed life. Later, when the first civilizations ventured into deep space, they may have begun sending various kinds of seeds — and occupied interstellar vehicles being or containing our UFOs — to initiate and promote evolution on other planets. Thus, life may not have begun elsewhere so very long before it began on Earth, and even if it did, it may not be all that far ahead today, biologically or technologically. . I referred to this process as the \"compression of evolution\" — the more backward a place is, the more it tends to have its evolutipn assisted. Conversely, the more advanced a place is the less help it receives and the lower its rate of evolution; this is the second reason herewith proposed why extraterrestrials have not taken over — they have not yet had enough time, because they themselves came to spacefaring not so .long ago. If the most advanced part of, galactic civilization were, say, 100,000 years beyond that on Earth (i.e., were at present where we would be in 100,000 years -without help), a moment in the age of the galaxy, it may still be very, very advanced even if technological progress slows owing to the aforesaid limitation effect. However, as this length of time -.approximates that required to span our galaxy at the speed of light, it probably is insufficient for a complete galactic colonization. Moreover, if what has been theorized here so far is true, we may not have had visitors from other galaxies because they may not be advanced enough nor have had time, in view of the great distances. ECONOMICS The third such reason' is connected with a theory of mine about the economic progress of industrialized societies: As they develop beyond a certain point of diminishing returns, they will gradually cease investing their economic products (e.g., money) toward the employment of more and more energy, materials, space, and labor, and thenceforth will increasingly (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"ECONOMY, Continued invest toward the conservation of these economic bases, so as to realize, growing savings- derived from this conservation. 2 . • ' : . . To do so will avoid the multiplying various costs of exponential quantitative. ', : (or gross)i economic • growth, and indeed will become the only way to raise profits and benefits, to enhance the real, net standard of living. The change will come about owing to the multifarious limits, shortages, and \"diseconomies\" encountered more and more frequently with the obsolescent gross growth of the economy. Thus, a new mode of growth will ensue, continued growth in value but by way of technologically increasing conservation — qualitative^ net growth. Therein, just about all'tasks will be performed with less and :less ,means (especially in respect to the quantities utilized of energy, materials, space and labor). Obviously this runs directly counter to the conventional wisdom that future society will'employ ever more energy, etc.; but if the conventional wisdom were right, astronomers should have, seen evidence of advanced ET cjvilizatipns'effects. This new kind of growth, I submit, is an inevitability pertaining to all economically advanced civiliations everywhere. It implies that the society or societies behind the UFOs use methods of, operation that employ minimal' means. 3 ' And this jibes with what: has '.been -seen': the fleeting appearances, the dearth of hard evidence,'.. the, ! lack of the full-scale contact that would bring sudden arid drastic change upon us. On Earth today we are gradually shifting toward this new kind of economic growth, although by no means are we yef'into it. This alone (which should bring our socio- economic systems progressively into harmony with that of the UFOs), plus our progress in general, plus an expected gradual rise in UFO activity (as per this' theory), may well bring us into increasing contact with, 1 the \"galactic community.\" MAGIC Now, here are some remarks of inference and summary:  ( . , 1.1 believe that the three/'reasons\" while mainly, independent are consistent with .each other and all essentially true. Even if only any one is true, many' of the observed UFO characteristics are accounted for on the basis of an ET origin. . 2. It is because of unknown near- term objectives, methods of operation that differ radically from' ours, and . advanced technology producing rriagic- , like effects, that particular acts of UFOs . are incomprehensible to us. 3. But \"they\" are not so advanced as i\" to be omnipotent. Their innate intelligence capacity may perhaps not be much greater or better,than ours. 4. At''least three factors account for the overall UFO influence being, so far, inconspicuous and nondisruptive: (a) the limitations of their technology and time in existence, (b) the time requirements . incurred and other difficulties caused by stellar distances, \" arid (c) the socio-economic .imperative to do things by lesser and lesser means. These would be connected with a jikely intention to \"extend the community\" by utilizing and improving the existing •material :— we Earthlings arid our works — rather thari invading in force, destroying it, and replacing it. 5. Relatedly, putting across new or differing ideas within a society is not easy, nor is transferring. technology from one 'society, relatively, a little ahead, to another on the same planet. •So it must be unfeasible for \"them\" to teach us quickly their science, far advanced (even if it is only thousands rather than:a billion years beyond .ours) and very different in objective and kind. The technical problem of transferring technology probably constitutes another inherent limitation. This too would serve to reduce contact, but still they might be imparting incremental advances to our minds rriore or less secretly. ' 6. We can form a rough idea of the propulsion of UFOs, based on assumptions consonant with this ET theory, as follows. With relativity and other known physical laws' setting limiting conditions, an interstellar ship could travel up to nearly the speed of light without a prohibitively great power source requirement (or'one violating minimal means) only by controlled conversion of its own matter and that of its contents into kinetic energy. This would be done in variable degrees up to nearly the entire.me 2 content of the said matter, affording almost instant acceleration, and reversibly, with rematerialization at the destination. 4 Of'course, we do not know whether this cari ever be a technological possibility; as of now it seerns to be a- reasonable guess according with the observed features of UFOs and with what must be.' \" • .To* hypothesize further: (a) The implementation technique of this \"energization\" of the UFO tends to energize also the immediate surroundings, disrupting matter (with 1 electromagnetic and radiation effects), causing the adjacerit air to glow' and move aside so that it presents no resistance, and, farther away, making insulators -conductive, thereby stopping car engines; ,(b) .uniform energization of all particles of the craft and its contents eliminates any force of acceleration thereupon, permitting sudden acceleration to speeds up to nearly that of light (this could explain the seemingly instant vanishings, also); (c) in accordance with conservation of momentum, a \"jet\" of completely energized matter (matter or antimatter carried by the craft as a sort of fuel) is ejected in the direction opposite that pf the craft's acceleration, but without a rocket-like blast; (d) for space travel, nearly complete energization allows the ship to pass through thin gas and dust- without damage (complete energiza- tion, with a corresponding speed 1 equal to light, would reduce the material component to zero, causing loss of control arid indeed 'disintegration); (e) the changes of shape observed are only apparent due to refraction of light or varying stimulation of light emission by the energization means, or real due to slightly nonunifofm energization or to external forces on a craft rendered flexible by energization, or a combination of these. OCCUPANTS (continued on page 17)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"SIGHTING REPORTS HUMMING DISC A recurrent feature of UFO inquiry is the surfacing of sightings and encounters that actually took place .many years before. Recently, during the latter part of 1985, one such incident was brought to my attention-by one of my co-workers who made mention of her mother's sighting. Eventually, I obtained a signed account from the witness (via her daughter), and also had the opportunity to, briefly meet her in person. . The locale of this nearly lost UFO observation was Far Rockaway, an outlying section of Queens county, one of the five boroughs that comprise New York City. The incident itself took place . sometime between 1975:1978 though the witness, Rose M. Kras, then in her late fifties, cannot specify the exact year. She recalled that it must have been the beginning of November as the leaves were no longer on the tress. It was a warm clear night, around 11 PM, and Rose was taking her dog for his evening walk. They were about 100 feet from the shore of Jamaica Bay when Rose suddenly heard a low humming sound. She looked up and saw nearly .overhead a round object emitting a soft silvery glow. Its altitude was not very high, being about three stories above the houses in the area. Rose estimated the diameter at about 20 feet, and the thickness at between 6-8 feet. The object hovered motionlessly for some 2-3 minutes, then took off very slowly to the east. When.the object started to move, the humming sound increased slightly in pitch. It disappeared from sight about a minute later over the LILCO (Long Island Lighting Company) power plant two blocks away. And what was the reaction of the witness to this very out of the ordinary and unexpected occurrence? Her own 8 words tell it best: \"I wasn't frightened; but as I looked at it I wondered if someone was in the object and was looking down at me. Naturally I got excited that I had seen this.\" When I had the opportunity to briefly meet with Rose Kras she made a point of emphasizing the feeling of excitement. In fact, she went back a number of times to the sighting location \"hoping it would come back and I could see it again.\" .Her hope never materialized. Rose had no dreams about the incident (I had been a bit suspicious concerning a possible abduction factor), nor did she experience any physical effects. The dog did look up, but continued his walk, exhibiting none of the oft-reported animal reactions. Though my personal meeting with the witness was unfortunately brief, I was impressed by her demeanor as a solid-type individual. She had no interest in seeking notoriety, and although most curious as to her own observation, had no interest in pursuing the matter of the subject further. She did express regret that no one else could offer supporting testimony as to what she saw. What did Rose Kras see? Was she a victim of some gross misperception, or an observer of something truly anomalous? While the passage of time since her sighting acts as an inhibitive factor in a thorough inquiry, nonetheless the data provided does allow for a reasonable analysis. Ruled out with absolute certainty is a misperception of any type of astronomical source (bright planet or star, fireball meteor, the moon). Also ruled out with absolute certainty is any misperception of a satellite, or of any type of fixed-wing aircraft (including the troublesome advertising plane). Could a lighted weather balloon or a helicopter be the responsible stimulus? While each of these two explanation modes might satisfy some of the sighting characteristics, neither such explanation can satisfy all of the observational data as provided by the witness. Was a true UFO present that night over Far Rockaway? Perhaps. At the very least such a possibility must be given serious consideration. -Herbert S. Taylor BOOMERANG I would like to report a sighting that occurred on September 14, 1985 at Lake Casitas near .Ojai, California. I have not had a chance to follow up on reports from other witnesses so incjude here a description by the principals, Phyllis and her husband Hector. Phyllis reported that nine people were in .her camping party including some children. At about 8 p.m. on that night, Phyllis was preparing a barbecue when someone in her camping party spotted some bright white lights that were moving in the sky west of her position on a course from northeast to southwest. One light rose to a high point in the sky, then stopped. This light then swooped down on the camping party and passed slowly over their heads at low altitude. Phyllis said the object appeared to be a very large craft shaped like a boomerange with a continuous row of fixed white lights along the outer perimeter and fixed blue lights along the inner perimeter. The object had rounded edges with no sharp corners. A bulkier mid-section seemed to protrude from the under belly. The surface was dark. Hector reported the object as oval- shaped and said he could see dimly-lit windows. Hector is a carpenter by trade and used to working with measurements so I asked him to estimate the object's size and altitude. He felt it was approximately 600 ft. from tip to tip and had passed not more than (continued on page 19)"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"A MAN TELL DIARY By T. Scott Grain, Jr. T.

Although the Air Force pieced together several explanations for the cause of the crash, the official conclusions do not stand up under scrutiny. Upon review Air Force documents of the incident from Project Bluebook, a copy of MantelPs Aircraft Accident Report, and numerous research notes of UFO investigators from here and abroad, I've come to the conclusion that the object Mantell was chasing was neither the planet Venus or a Navy skyhook balloon. The evidence points to something ' of a more extraordinary nature. This report examines the facts that led me to this consclusion. At 1:15 p.m. on January 7, 1948, several witnesses from Maysville, Kentucky, called the Kentucky State Highway Patrol to report a strange aerial object moving westward. Twenty minutes later, witnesses in Owensboro and Irvington, Kentucky, called the State Police to report something unusual in the sky that was \"circular, about 250 to 300 feet in diameter,\" accelerating west at a \"pretty good At. 1:45 p.m. the Assistant Tower Operator at Godman Air Force Base, Kentucky, suddenly saw the unusual object and called his chief to see it. When the two officers were convinced •• the UFO \"was not an airplane or a weather balloon\" they informed flight operations. 2 The presence of the UFO was brought to the attention of the Base Operations Officer, the Base Intelligence Officer and the Base Capt. Thomas F. Mantell Commander who all observed the UFO through the tower's 6X50 binoculars and were unable to identify it. At 2:30 p.m. an unidentified man in Madisonville, Kentucky, \"...called in a report on an unknown which, with the aid of a telescope, he had identified as a balloon.\" 33 At 2:45 p.m. the P-51's. flew over Godman Field. At 2:48 p.m. Mantell is asked by the tower if he would investigate. What happens, next can best be described in the summary from the official Aircraft Accident Report on Mantell: \"On 7 January 1948, a flight of four P-51's departed Marietta Air Base, Marietta, Georgia, en route to Standiford Field, Louisville, Kentucky. Captian Mantell was acting flight commander for the four aircraft. The flight was planned and scheduled as a ferry and navigational trip at low level. The flight proceeded without incident to the vicinity of Godman Field, Kentucky. Nearing the field, Captain Mantell was asked by Godman tower to investigate an unidentified object in the sky to the southwest if his mission would permit. Captain Mantell replied his mission was ferrying aircraft, but he would attempt to identify the object. He turned the flight in that direction and began a maximum climb in left spirals until approximately 14,000 feet, then transitioned to a straight climb at maximum power. By the time Captain Mantell had reached approximately 22,500 feet, three of the four flight members broke off because of lack of oxygen. When last observed by one of his departing wingmen, Captain Mantell had passed 22,500 feet and was heard to say that he would level at 25,000 feet for about 10 minutes. Further transmissions were garbled and attempts to contact him by his flight went unanswered. A ground observer noted an aircraft circling at high altitude, then descending in a spiral. Approximately halfway through the descent, the plane was observed to disintegrate and crash. Captain Mantell was fatally injured in the crash.\" 4 QUESTIONS , The controvery in this case has two parts: one, what was Mantell pursuing and two, why did he crash? The official answers to these questions appear in the book, Project Bluebook, edited by Brad Steiger. The report states: \"It is the [Air Technical Information Command] opinion that Captain Mantell lost consciousness due to oxygen starvation, the aircraft being trimmed continued to climb until increasing altitude caused a sufficient loss of power for it to level out. The aircraft then began a turn to the left due to torque and as the wing drooped so did the nose until the aircraft was in a tight diving spiral. The uncontrolled descent resulted in excessive speed causing the aircraft to disintegrate. It is believed that Captain Mantell never (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"r- v },:;,.»- T •-T^s^BSL — ** MANTELL, continued .regained consciouness. This is born out by the fact that the canopy lock was still in place after the crash, discount ing any attempt to abandon the aircraft. The UFO wasinwaydirec?/y responsible for this experienced pilot conducting a high altitude flight without the necessary oxygen equipment. There were two conceptions as to the identity of the object; Venus, one of the brightest objects in our heavens, or a large balloon used for high altitude experimental flights and known as 'sky hooks.\" 5 VENUS Now let us examine the official version in detail. The first conception as to the identity of the object was Venus, which was located at the approximate directional position coinciding with the UFO. An Air Force representative from 10 the Pentagon stated, without reservation, that \"...they checked again and it was Venus,\" according to an article in the Saturday Evening Post. 6 This is the only explanation that was offered and it met little opposition for many . months. Hence, poor Mantell was officially listed as attempting-to reach Venus before he crash and died. The story might have ended here except for a few noted individuals who pursued the case further and through careful analysis determined that the facts disagreed with official conclusion. In his book. The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, Edward J. Ruppelt, former head of the U.S. Air Force project investigating flying saucers, wrote he was \"... convinced that the UFO wasn't Venus,\" 7 He, along with Dr. J. Allen Hynek, then head of the Ohio State University Astronomy Department and now director of the Center for UFO Studies in Evanston, Illinois, reviewed the entire case. They concluded that although Venus was located in approximately the same spot as the UFO, \"...Venus wasn't bright enough to be seen,\" the day Mantell was killed. 8 When Air Force brass got wind of this, the official explanation was changed to teeter on a new conclusion. The Air Force now decided that the UFO Tesponsible for killing Mantell, \"might have been Venus or it could • have been a balloon. Maybe two balloons. It probably was Venus except that this is doubtful because Venus was too dim to be seen in the afternoon.\" 9 A curious way to put the death of an Air Force pilot. Even the official • report says \"...atmosphere conditions ' must be exceptionally good,\" to view Venus in the daytime. 10 Atmospheric conditions were anything but good the day Mantell died, for weather reports indicated there was considerable haze in the area. 11 The point to be made here is that the- Air Force switched their opinion of the cause of the crash from a positive solution (Venus), to an uncertain solution (probably not Venus, maybe a balloon). It's obvious the Air Force lacked sufficient evidence to foist either solution with certainty, so they unconvincingly stated it probably was a balloon or a planet, not knowing for sure which it was. BALLOON The second conception as to the identity of the object came several years later when the Navy Department disclosed they. were using large balloons for-high'altitude experimental flights known as \"sky-hooks,\" in the vicinity on the day of the sighting. The reason the explanation wasn't offered sooner is that the Navy program was classified at the time. Therefore these balloon flights were known only to a select few. Hence, the official report states, \"It has been unofficially reported that the object was a Navy cosmic ray balloon. If this can be established, it is to be preferred as an explanation.\" 12 The Air Force goes on to substantiate their \"new\" conclusion in Steiger's book. (confirmed next page)"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MANTELL, Continued \"It was subsequently determined that on the date of the Godmari sighting, a balloon was released by the Navy from Clinton County airport in Ohio. The release time of the balloon was related to a wind plot for 7 January 1948, and it revealed that the balloon would have been in the area of Godman at the time of the sighting.\" 13 The first flaw in this explanation is that no one to. this, day has ever produced the records of a balloon launching that would put a skyhook in the right place at the right time the day , Mantell died. Captain Ruppelt, an insider to the official UFO investigation, could find no records to put a skyhook in the area during that day. If records did exist, as the Air Force claims they do, they surely would, have been made public by now.-  , : Secondly, the official Bluebook report states \"...the prime culprit is believed to have:been the skyhook balloon released by the Navy. Captain Mantell was attempting to close in on a. balloon which was 'still- more than 40JOOO feet above him.\" 14 However, in an article, in \"Official UFO,\" February 1975 issue, B.R. Strong writes, \"''..the balloon isn't high enough for all the other sightings. Air Force calculations showed that it would have to be 25 to 50 miles high.\" 15 The skyhook balloon had only half the required altitude. And finally, the balloon that was supposedly the cause of Mantell's misfortune was never recovered. 16 OTHER SIGHTINGS Sometime between 5-5:20 p.m. reports of a large ball of light in the sky are reported over Lockbourne tower (Columbus, Ohio) and Clinton County tower, another airport in Ohio. According to Aime Michel in his book, The Truth About Flying Saucers, observers at Lockbourne tower said the object was \"...traveling at 500 miles per hour and has changed in color from silvery grey to amber, leaving in its track a tail five times its own length....\" 17 Other reports of UFOs were being made over a wide area.

Among the witnesses were police officers, military pilots, aircraft control tower operators and ranking military officers, all of QE UOIDITO K. UATTUBfTS Major. U3AF Deputy Couaander whom are familiar with the planet Venus and balloons, but were unable to identify this object. An interesting study was made by Dr. J. Allen Hynek,. Director of the Center for UFO Studies, shortly after the incident. Michel writes: \"The investigations conducted by Professor Hynek during the period immediately after Mantell's death showed that the same object had been seen simultaneously at Madisonville, Elizabethtown and Lexington, nearly 100 miles from Fort Knox, a few minutes after the F-51 had disintegrated.\" 19 In other words, the UFO was observed at the same time in three (continued next page) 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"MANTELL, Continued different locations, up to 175 miles apart. How is that possible? Michel continues: \"...the observers in the Lockboume control tower who estimated its speed at more than 500 miles per hour reported that they were watching it for no less than twenty minutes. In twenty minutes an object traveling at 500 miles an hour covers a distance of about 175 miles, a figure which tallies with the previous one. '20 SKYHOOK Based on the above scenario, it is conceivable that one object could have been responsible for the UFO sightings in those three areas. Based on Air Force calculations, in order for the UFO to account for all the other sightings, it had to be flying at an altitude of at least 25 miles, possibly 50, to be seen in all three towns and Lockbourne tower. If we can believe Mantell, an experienced pilot, when he says \"It's directly ahead of me. I am going to climb and get nearer,\" one could estimate the object to be at 25,000 feet since Mantell was a little over 22,000 feet when he saw it. With this information, three points can be made, which throw considerable doubt on the \"skyhook explanation\" for Mantell's death. 1. A skyhook ballon had less than half the required altitude to account for all the other UFO sightings. Skyhook balloons can ascend to about 70,000 feet (14 miles), whereas Mantell's UFO is estimated to be 25 to 50 miles high. 2. In the few minutes that passed between Mantell's crash and the UFO's appearance in three towns, the object had risen from approximately 25,000 feet (5 miles), to an altitude of at least 25 miles. That speed is at least 420 miles per hour. 3. In his book, Michel estimates the UFO would have to be between 300 and 450 feet in diameter to account for the sightings over such a large geographical area. Skyhook balloons are approximately 100 feet in diameter. MANTELL & OXYGEN )fort of skull inJ r.calp t' In «A boll »irwJd»d Uft Bins .

Mantell knew he was reaching the maximum altitude for his P-51 without oxygen, yet he continued to climb. Why? Ruppelt .writes: \"Why did Mantell, an experienced pilot, try to go to 20,000 feet when he didn't even have an oxygen mask? If he had run out of oxygen, it would have been different. Every pilot and crewman has it pounded into him, 'do not, under any circumstances, go above 15,000 feet without oxygen.' In high-altitude indoctrination during World War II, I made several trips up to 30,000 feet in a pressure chamber. To demonstrate anoxia we would leave our oxygen masks off until we became dizzy. A few more of the hardy souls could get to 15,000 feet, but nodody got over 17,000. Possibly Mantell thought he could climb up to 20,000 in a hurry and get back down before he got anoxia and blacked out, but this would be a foolish chance. This point was covered in the sighting report. A long-time friend of Mantell's went on record as saying that he'd flown with him for several years and knew him personally. He couldn't conceive of Mantell's .even thinking about disregarding his lack of oxygen. Mantell was one of the most cautious pilots he knew. 'The only thing I can' think,' he commented, 'u;as that he was after something that he believed to be more important than his life or his family.'\"*' The question remains, what did Mantell see that would entice him to altitudes that he knew would kill him quickly? A possible solution which is in direct contrast to offical Air Force reports is related in Leonard H. Stringfield's book, Situation Red, The UFO Siege. Stringfield, a long-time (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MANTELL, Continued UFO investigator, worked with the Air Defense Command from 1953-57 in the investigation and reporting of UFO activity as well as an early warning co- ordinator for the Colorado Project under Dr. Condon. His credentials are impeccable, having served in important posts with NICAP, IUFOR, MUFON and the Center for UFO Studies. Stringfield writes, \"My informant, preferring anonymity, related that he had talked with Mantell's wing man, who witnessed the incident. The pilot stated that Mantell pursued the UFO because he was the only pilot with an adequate oxygen mask. The pilot also related that he saw a burst of 'what appeared to be tracer' fired from the UFO, which hit the P-51 and caused it to disintegrate in the air! Since the Mantell case, all other military encounters ending in disaster have been hidden from the public.\" 22 Stringfield's account certainly contradicts the Air Force version; and if we didn't know Stringfield better, one would think he was guilty of sensationalizing the incident. But when one examines Stingfield's passage closer, do the known facts really contradict the informant's allegations? Let's examine the evidence. The informant states, contrary to the Air Force opinion, that Mantell did have an adequate oxygen mask aboard 'his plane. I researched this question in detail because if he was carrying oxygen, Mantell had no reason not to continue pursuing the object. Through the assistance of two New Jersey UFO Researchers, Fred Schafer and Gerald Miskar, we purchased a copy of Mantelli's Aircraft Accident Report from Norton Air Force Base, California, for some help with this question. The report had one 'document relevant to the oxygen question. It states: \"Aircraft were not serviced with oxygen as none was available at this station. Pilots of aircraft did not request oxygen on checking in with line chief or operations.\" The location of the station is censored, but since Mantell and his crew took off at Marietta, we assume it was Marietta Air Base in Georgia. One must remember that Standiford Field, Louisville, Kentucky was Mantell's home base, so its' possible he could have gotten oxygen there before he left. According to Project Bluebook, Mantell's wingman Lt. Buford Hammond advised Lt. Albert Clements that he had no oxygen equipment, but Mantell continued to climb. Nowhere in the official report could I find any evidence to suggest that Mantell indicated that he had no oxygen mask. Why did .the Air Force assume Mantell carried no such oxygen? According to Stringfield, one wingman (either Hammond or Clements) knew Mantell had oxygen. This could explain why Mantell continued to climb. Some research was carried out by Captain Ruppelt to secure Mantell's wingmen's accounts of the incident. But according to Ruppelt all this evidence was, \"...in the ruined portion of the microfilm, even their names were missing.\" 23 How convenient for the Air Force to have this critical testimony destroyed. If one of the wingmen had mentioned this fact, it was not to be rediscovered. According to the informant, one of Mantell's wingmen saw the UFO emit something at Mantell's plane. Is this possible? Lt. Buford Hammond and Lt. Albert Clemetns, the other two pilots who pursued the object with Mantell, saw the unusual object. In the book, Flying Saucers on the Attack, Harold T. Wilkins writes that' the other two pilots radioed, \"This strange object is too high for us to catch. It's going too fast.\" 24 In The Encyclopedia of UFOs, edited by Ronald D. Story, he writes that one of the other pilots described it as \"round like a teardrop, and at times almost fluid.\" One of these pilots could have observed what happened to Mantell. 25 The informant also states the UFO fired a projectile at Mantell's plane causing it to explode in the air. Flammonde, in his book, UFOs Exist, writes, \"...Glen Mayes, who lives near Franklin, said he saw the Mantell plane flying at an extremely high altitude just before it seemed to explode in the air.\" 2 ' The informant concludes that other military encounters with UFOs ending in disaster have been withheld from the public. There are numerous cases on record, where the military have attempted to cover up incidents where planes or personnel have been lost. 27 When one examines the facts in the case, is Stringfield's account so far fetched? In May 1985, I wrote to Leonard Stringfield, asking for more details about the statements in his book. His response was that his informant related this information to him in the mid 1970s, and was at the time a student at the University of Cincinnati in Ohio. When I asked about his informant's reliability, Stringfield said, \"Hard to say. He seemed sincere and knowledgeable in his profession, but that is not enough to pass a qualified judgment.\" Commenting on his informant's information, he states, \"What he did relate is contrary to the known facts about the incident and, if true, I'm sure the Air Force would never admit' it.\" The wingmen who the informant claims made these statements was 2nd Lt. Buford Hammond. If Hammond is still alive and could be interviewed, we may have another story of what really killed Thomas Mantell. CONCLUSIONS The object Mantell allegedly chased was estimated to be 300-450 feet in diameter, accelerated at 500 miles per hour, and reached altitudes from 25 to 50 miles high. In contrast, skyhook balloons are 100 feet in diameter, have average speeds of 175 miles per hour and reach altitudes of 13.2 miles. The idea that Mantell was playing cat and mouse in the air with Venus that afternoon is highly improbable. In my opinion, the cause of the crash was due to Mantell losing consciousness at approximately 25,000 feet. The plane then went into a spiraling dive, and plummeted back to earth. Although I have presented evidence that an aerial attack may have taken place, I find this conclusion an unlikely explanation.

Movie stars read the daily trade journals to see if a critic has gotten on their case. Politicians do crazy things to be accepted and to avoid criticism. Engineers hate to have their designs criticized. Cooks become irate if their 'culinary creation is not loved by all: UFO researchers will close out a case with only cursory investigation if a critic .questions their endeavors. . The effort to please the critic is natural in a way. Human beings generally strive for perfection. When the critic questions that perfection the natural reaction is to neutralize the criticism. The, easiest way to accomplish that is to give in and try to be liked by the critic. Hopefully then, the critic will pick on someone else as the target of their venom. Actually, people .should accept criticism, only when, it is done in a constructive manner. There is no inherent requirement for .people to accept abusive behavior, whether verbal or written. Maybe it would help to remember that the critic makes a living off of the people that do the work. Naturally, the critic hopes to gain some personal recognition out of the interchange and often does. Often this is ill-gotten gain. In 1910, Theodore Roosevelt clearly defined the difference between the critic and the doer, as follows: , • \"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. . The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, and comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who.knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in'the end the' triumph of high achievements, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.\" In closing, consider how few monuments have been built in honor of"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"critics.

Short New Scientist 3 Afrt 1986 Hybrid aircraft prepares for test flight CROSS help between an airship and a r, called Hystar, could soon forestry industry. Helen Gavaghan It can reach trees that other aircraft cannot reach-^at least not economically. Hystar is the result of a development project that George Ninkbvich of the Hystar Development Corporation in Vancouver started in 1978. Ninkovich's team of engineers is working on both piloted and remotely-controlled .models. This month, the first remotely- controlled Hystar will be deliv- ered to the C ana ^' an govern- ment and the piloted version will fly for the first time. The fanaHian government Will show its Hystar at the World Fair, which opens in Vancouver in May. The fair's theme is transport 'and communication. Visitors to the Canada pavilion will see Hystar being manoeuvred around the main hall ' The remotely-controlled models can be any size between 4-5 and 17 metres long, and be able to lift between 1 8 and 680 kilo- grams. The piloted craft, known as Hystar 2, will be between 1.7 and 35 metres long with lifting capacities of 680 to 6800 kilo- grams. .Ninkovich says that the Hystar should find applications .in agriculture, for example crop spraying, and in mining. But the industry which inspired the machine's development is logging. Ninkovich says: \"There is some lovely old timber deep in the Canadian forests.\" If it could be felled and removed without disturbing surrounding trees, the forest would replant itself naturally, and the old timber would not rot away. Unfortunately, Canada's latest contribution to air travel the economics of such selective logging are not favourable. Building roads is expensive and can damage the environment, because when trees are felled for the road, the natural drainage is disturbed/The result can be landslides or sediment washing down into rivers and damaging the envi- ronment for fish. Another way to reach the timber would be from the air. The forestry industry in the US has employed helicopters to airlift timber from the centre of forests. But the helicopters needed for such a task must be modified to cope with a large number of short runs each day. Only 15 helicopters in the world have been modified for aerial logging. These include Sikorsky 64s and Boeing 107s. Another disadvantage of helicopters is the amount of fuel needed to lift the machine itself. For example, the Sikorsky 64 can lift 19 885 kilograms. Of this, only 9000 kilograms is load. As an alternative to helicop- ters, Ninkovich considered balloons, but these proved difficult to operate and to control. Airships are equally impractical, because they need to be very large to lift heavy loads. Airships are also dim- cult to control and to hold steady while they are being loaded and unloaded. In 1978, Ninkovich decided that what was needed was an envelope containing helium to provide lift and rotors and/or propellers to provide additional lift and control. His first design resembled a catamaran, with two hulls filled with helium. This design, however, proved unstable. Eventually, Ninkovich's team settled on the idea of a toroidally-shaped envelope. \"The Hystar can describe a square, travel at speeds between 1-6 and 104-6 kilometres/hour, and its operating costs are about one third those of a helicopter,\" Ninkovich says.

Waves;or flaps such as the 1973 experience are scarce, and each wave brings us one step closer to the answer. To help prepare you, I am offering these suggestions:  • 1), Read. the. MUFON Field Investigator's Manual: 2) Take the F.I. Exam as soon as possible. \"\"' ' 3) Get the F.I. Kits organized and equipped. 4) Set up a \"Filter Center\" with a published telephone number, a 24-hour \"hotline.'-' ' : ' . ' 5) Send out,, periodically, a status report to local law enforcement dispatchers and airport control tower' operators, and, occasionally, the news media.  •'','. MUFON MANUAL The Field Investigator's Manual is a tool some of us veterans never had 'available. It was prepared through the combined experience of many UFO .researchers and its use will make you a more .qualified Field Investigator. Just asking questions and filling out papers • is a good part of being an investigator, but anyone can do that. Separating the UFOs from the IFOs requires something extra. If we want to get to the bottom of this UFO mystery, we must do the best we can. Besides, our work is being scrutinized and criticized by a few skeptics who get a lot of attention in the press. Let's be professional about our work and take it very seriously. As Marge Christensen, our.. MUFON Public Relations Director,.has said, this is a \"volunteer profession.\" . '.' If you do not have a Field ' .Investigator's Manual, one can be 16 obtained from MUFON for only $6.00; the best $6.00 you ever, spent. The cost to non-members is $10.00, plus $1.50 for postage and handling. EXAMINATION : .. After you have read the F.I. Manual, you should be able to pass the F.I. Exam. Knowing what you are lacking in UFO-related knowledge will help you to be a better UFO investigator. Your state director will help you acquire and submit your test to the appropriate people. If you need further assistance, contact Walter Andrus, at MUFON headquarters. INVESTIGATOR KITS -\"•-,''•£ • - Materials needed for your kits are listed in the manual on page 13. They, are grouped Under three classifications: \"necessary,\" \"desirable\" .and \"optional.\" A small briefcase works we)l for the primary kit, which I call Kit ttiB. I put the MUFON questionnaires and the Manual in this kit. The Kit #1A contains the rest of the necessary materials, .such as maps, compass, flashlight, etc. Kit #2 has the \"desirable\" materials for special evidence gathering, including tape recorders, binoculars, plaster of paris, etc. I have other kits for \"optional\" materials! One of these is Kit #3 for the V-700 geiger counter and data recorder, etc. The point is, being organized will help you avoid loss of data, and even if no one knows what you missed, you will. I think we are all in . this for the same reason. We want to solve the mystery and want to help if we can.    . ', STATUS REPORT When I was a state-section director (and as state director, I still do it), I sent a monthly status, report to police, sheriff, state police and airport control tower people in my three counties. This helped maintain good relations after an initial in-person contact and has worked well for the last 13-years in my district. I now send this report to all my state investigators by making it a state report. If you wish a sample copy, send a SASE and I will send you a copy. My address is 618 Davis Drive, Mt. Vernon, IN 47620. The people who read these, basically dispatchers, know to transfer UFO reports to ypu by constantly seeing your group exposed monthly or periodically. In .fact, they don't particularly want to pursue this type of an occurrence, so they are glad,to \"dump\" it on you. My state people will get a \"3x5\" card that lists MUFON Field Investigators in their particular area. This card can be placed under glass or on a bulletin board near the dispatcher, so that he or she has ready access to the local UFO person by phone. Kerry Teverbaugh, one of my state-section directors, advised us that the Indiana. State Police suggested this. I will . provide these so that they can be filled out and sent to all law-enforcement and control tower people. A lot of UFOs, observed by local citizens (some highly qualified), do not get reported. A news bulletin or story will focus attention on the fact that they can phone you anytime and get a fair hearing or, if they can't remember, they will call the local police who will forward the report to you. Remember, the police dispatcher may not believe in UFOs, but if you use finesse and courtesy, he/she will probably transfer . these calls to you. SKYNET I go a little further than these five suggestions. I set up ai SKYNET, which includes law enforcement people who want to help and other people who I call \"spotters.\" These \"spotters\" are (continued on page 18)"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MANTELL, Continued evidence, the credibility of a single, unidentified informant is not grounds enough to support his allegations.'

No problem for the ET theory.. There is a biological principle of convergent'evolution of morphology, namely, that two or more species evolving in separate places, without contact and with different genetic constitutions, sometimes do develop very similar forms so as to fill . similar environmental!.;niches '. It is ,1 evidently true .then that only (or predominately) .the human-like form is suitable for technology and space travel, based on the reports of the beings associated with UFOs. Moreover, such evolutionary parallelism is enhanced to the degree that the lines of development are not genetically separate, and all the more so when an intelligent species guides the development • of a less-advanced one, the ultimate conclusion of which could be the merging of the two. ,8. The consistency of no gross interference by a variety of UFO i entities over many, many years suggests either the reality of a galactic community or .confederation ; implementing in coordination the principle of minimal means, or a remarkably uniform execution of this principle among all of the civilizations producing UFOs. 9. It would not be a coincidence that UFOs are visiting Earth at this time . (rather than, say, anytime within the last two billion years) if indeed our present state of advancement were due in part to concurrency in galactic evolution in general and in part to the influence of galactic civilization in particular.   . There is no need to resort to recondite hypotheses, nor to stretch ideas of mundane origin to the far- fetched (e.g., UFOs are floaters in the eye), to 'account for UFOs. The ^extraterrestrial theory suffices, it fulfills Occam's Razor. There is no substantial reason not to at least tentatively accept it: Advanced ET civilization almost certainly exists, and UFOs are evidence thereof; Reasonable assumptions made within the ET framework to explain their characteristics serve as clues to'the nature of ET society and the future of Earth society.

All UFO-related calls are taped while I.fill out a \"message slip,\" which asks the necessary, basic questions about the sighting. The National UFO .Reporting Center .in Seattle .and the Center For UFO Studies, both use such a slip for their incoming, calls.

'I also have a Muraphone which is a rechargeable portable radio telephone that I take outside to observe the sector of sky alleged to have a UFO in it. I can thus talk to the observer, one of my spotters or the control tower, continuously while this data is being recorded. The recorder stops and starts when the phone is picked up inside or the portable phone is turned on. I also take along a strobe light (a flashlight would be satisfactory) so that if I did observe a conspicuous lighted object, I could attempt a light beam response. If you have a TV tower in your yard, as I do, you can take your binoculars and other gear right up with you or, if you have a good sighting location, take your gear to that location. If you have to drive away from the 700 ft. range of the portable phone, you can maintain contact by using a CB radio and another investigator/spotter. We are fortunate to have a good UFO detector system, police and aircraft scanners that record data when actuated by a UFO or switched on during a sighting by the operator (if not automatically activated). The basic tools are within your reach. These are just a few ideas, to help you gather the most data accurately when the next THE NIGHT SKY By Walter N. Webb MUFON Astronomy Consultant MAY 1986 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): (continued next page) Venus, still shining at magnitude -3.9, dominates the western sky for some 2 l / 2 hours after sunset, not setting until about 10:30 daylight time in midmonth. Mars, in Sagittarius, 1 rises about midnight in mid^May. The ruddy world contihues'to brighten, becoming four times more brilliant than its neighbor in the heavens, Saturn, by month's end. It lies 3° above the moon on the 17th. .. ^   . Saturn, in Ophiuchus, reaches a point opposite the sun on the 27th. At that time it rises at sunset and remains visible all night. With its famous rings tilted 25° to our view, the giant planet reflects more .light and thus gleams at magnitude O.O, its brightest in nine years. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): . Mars moves to a point due south at dawn. Jupiter, in Aquarius, rises in the east shortly before 3 AM daylight time in midmonth and stands in the SE at dawn. The brilliant planet is 2° above the quarter moon on the 31st. Saturn advances to the SW at dawn in mid-May and on its opposition date sets in the WSW at sunrise. Meteor Shower: 'Unlike last year's moonlit Eta Aquarids display, this year's show will not be spoiled by moon interference. Appearing to radiate from near the star Eta in the Water Jar of Aquarius, the shower is best seen on the mornings of May 4 and 5, darting all over the sky at a rate of about 20 per hour. The May Aquarids represent one of the two meteor showers that originates from debris in Comet Halley's orbit. ,      , Halley's Comet: Early in May start observing Halley near the end of evening twilight (about 9:30- 9:45 EDT). Although the comet will have ascended to an altitude of some 30° (in midnorthern latitudes) in the SSW sky, it is fading rapidly and by midmonth will probably have vanished from naked-eye view. Binoculars and telescopes will then be required to follow the receding object.   . . Moonlight will also interfere from about May 13-24. During the month Halley moves from the constellation Crater, across a corner of Hydra, and into Sextans (where it remains until the end of July). It may be observed for a few hours each night before setting in the west after midnight.

Full moon-May 23 (nearest full moon of the year produces year's highest tides on the 24th and 26th) Last quarter-May 30 The Stars: The sky symbol of spring, Leo the Lion, is past the celestial meridian at 10 PM daylight time in midmonth. At that hour we get our last glimpse of the winter stars Capella, Pollux and Castor, and Procyon as they sink into the west. To the NE, two of the three stars of the Summer Triangle, Vega and Deneb, are in view hinting at the approaching summer months. Antares, the heart of the scorpion, appears low in the SE. This first-magnitude red star is occulted by the moon from northern and central states on the morning of May 24. (At Kansas City and Chicago, for example, the star vanishes behind the lunar disc at 3:16 CDT.) The Big Dipper is very favorably placed in its upside-down position high overhead in the north. Two weeks later I visited Lake Casitas and found a number of camping sites surrounded by trees and hills. Only one airfield was in the vicinity and it catered to light aircraft. The air is very clear around the lake and the only aircraft I saw in the area were small private planes.
