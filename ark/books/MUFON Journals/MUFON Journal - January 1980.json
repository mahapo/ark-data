FROM THE EDITOR \"When it comes to normal adult witnesses a number of individual psychological data play a more direct role on the content and form of the statements than the witness's theoretical intelligence....Adjustment mechanisms and emotional disturbances of different kinds which characterize the witness may also be of importance for the analysis of the origin and contents of his statements.\" The author is referring to the normal range of individual characteristics, not to pathological personalities whose overt bizarre behavior is obvious even to laymen. An example follows of a witness who was basically normal, but who believed he had a \"sixth sense.\" \"(His) thinking was colored all through with magical concepts, which gave his experiences a supernatural overtone.\" The manner in which his preconceptions distorted his view of reality, and his testimony, is discussed. These quotes are from Reliability of Evidence by Arne Trankell (Stockholm: Beckmans, 1972), an English-language book whose sections on witness psychology and techniques of analyzing witness statements are applicable to UFO witnesses. Background information of this type is essential for evaluation of testimony from abduction or contactee claimants. In this issue THE RAAF INVESTIGATION OF UFOs   3 By William C.

Chalker (MUFON Representative for New South Wales) An Australian Department of Defence (Air Office) document entitled \"Text for Lectures on the Investigation of Unusual Aerial Sightings. in Australia\" indicates — In Australia, the RAAF is responsible for the investigation of unusual aerial sighting reports. This responsibility was vested in the air force in the early 1950s, when the Australian government, in common with the United Kingdom and the United States governments were concerned that UFOs might have posed a. threat to national security following several years investigation of sighting reports in Australia. 1 RAAF policy on the UFO subject finds some close parallels with those of the USAF, particularly when both lean heavily on the findings of the \"Condon Report.\" They refer to the main conclusions of the report, which on the basis of about 2 years investigations, indicated that \"nothing has come from the study of UFOs in the past 21 years that has added to scientific knowledge\" and that \"further extensive study of UFOs probably cannot be justified in the expectation that science will be advanced thereby.\" 2 To quote again from the above Defence Department document: While these general conclusions still hold true today, the RAAF continues to investigate reports of unusual aerial sightings as a service to the public. In almost all reported cases, people have seen something and are concerned as to the cause. In some cases, people are genuinely alarmed at the possibility that their experience may be extra-terrestrial in origin. We hope that through our investigations any fears that people may have about \"UFOs\" can be allayed. Although the majority of reports can be resolved satisfactorily, we do believe that there will always be a small percentage that win remain unresolved probably because of insufficient information being supplied, late receipt of the report or current scientific knowledge being insufficient to provide a definite explanation. Reports are made initially to the nearest Air Force Base. At the Base, the intelligence officer or other suitably qualified officer conducts the preliminary investigation. He contacts the observer personally or in writing to obtain a completed \"Report of Unusual Aerial Sighting\" Pro-Forma. This pro-forma is designed to extract all the information relevant to the sighting and the preliminary investigation is conducted based on this information. The investigation officer's report, which contains details of civil and military aircraft movements, star and planet positions, known satellite passes, meteorological balloon releases and prevailing weather conditions, and his assessment of the probable cause is then forwarded to the Directorate of Air Force Intelligence at the Department of Defence (Air . Office) in Canberra where' the investigation is completed and a reply sent to the observer. Where necessary, advice and information is sought from specialist agencies such as Weapons Research Establishment, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Defence Standards Laboratories, observatories and universities. During the period 1960 to 1976, the RAAF examined some 1,023 reports and Table 1 reveals the yearly breakdown. 3 While these percentage unidentified figures are a reasonable reflection of the quality of accounts received by the RAAF, they are in fact quite deceptive. If one undertakes an in- depth study of the military data, as I have done, it quickly becomes apparent that many of the \"possible causes\" suggested as the stimuli for various observations of \"Unusual Aerial Sightings\" are an effrontery to scientific method. By that I mean that many sightings are given unsatisfactory explanations. I have included here details of three such sightings and the \"possible causes\" that have been ascribed to them by the Department of Defence (Air Office). At 6:10 p.m., on October 10, 1960, the Reverend Lionel Browning and his wife observed a strange spectacle from the window of their rectory, at Cressy.

It was described as having \"about four vertical bands along the side of the object. At the bow end of the ship was a rod jutting out with what seemed like a small propeller or some radar device on the end.\" After about a minute the object stopped its steady movement and hovered, apparently between 400 to 500 above the Panshanger Estate. Rev. Browning indicates that then \"out of the clouds above and behind the ship, five or six' small discs came shooting at terrific speed. They came towards the ship like flat stones skipping along the water. The smaller objects stationed themselves beside their mothership within a half mile radius.\" These smaller objects were described as \"flying saucers about 30 feet in diameter with a flat underside and a rounded dome on top.... After several seconds the ship, accompanied by the saucers, reversed the way it came. The ship did not maneuvre to return because the rod end was the last section of the ship to be covered in the rain cloud.\" Another person, Mrs. D. Bransden, also saw the spectacle, describing it as like \"a lot of little ships flocking around a bigger one.\" The total duration of the .incident was about 2 minutes. 4 Wing Commander G.L. Waller of the RAAF interviewed the Brownings, and in a letter to the late Dr. James McDonald indicated that the couple \"impressed me as being mature, stable, and mentally alert individuals who had no cause or desire to see objects in the sky other than objects of definite form and substance.\" 5 These comments by the investigating officer are all the more astonishing when compared to the Air Force Intelligence statement on the sighting released a few days later. It dismissed the observation as \"a phenomena (caused by) a moon rise associated with meteorological conditions at the time.\" In fact the intelligence report stated, \"The presence of 'scud' type clouds, moving in varying directions due to turbulence in and around a rain squall near which the objects were sighted, and the position of the moon or its reflections, produced the impression of flying objects.\" 6 Rev. Browning and the late Dr. McDonald place the sighting into a more correct perspective. The former indicated, at no time during the 90 minute Air Force Intelligence interview was he asked about clouds. Rev. Browning added: \"At no time was there cloud or scud when I saw the objects. The mountain was not the backdrop to what I saw. The rain cleared in front of us although it was still raining near the mountains. I saw the objects in the sky where there was no rain and the rain near the mountains provided the backdrop...\" 7 Dr. McDonald was a senior physicist at the Institute of Atmospheric Physics and a professor in the Department of Meteorology, University of Arizona, and during a 1967 visit to Australia he conducted a detailed retrospective investigation of the Cressy sighting. He made the following succinct comments: Such an \"explanation\" has a curiously familiar ring to anyone who has studied large numbers of USAF \"explanations\" of UFO sightings. One can quickly establish that the moon was full on the date of the Cressy sighting.... (that it would have been obscured not only by rain clouds and Ben Lomond but would also have been in a different direction, a few degrees north of east, rather than ESE, the direction in question — W.C.C.) From my own viewpoint, as one interested in atmospheric optics and in unusual refractive and reflective anomalies, the official suggestion that \"scud\" subject to turbulent motions could (had the moon not been wholly obscured by rain and mountain) be optically distorted into anything remotely resembling the phenomena reported by the Brownings seems entirely out of question. In asserting such a meteorological explanation as was issued by the RAAF intelligence office, little evidence of scientific knowledge was exhibited, unless that office felt that the essential features of the Brownings' account had to be simply disregarded as unreliable. Yet the interrogating RAAF officer, Wg. Cdr. Waller, evidently had no such inclination to disregard these witnesses' description of their observations, nor do I. 8 A further lack of scientific methodology is evidenced in suggesting that the possible cause in both of the following incidences, is ascribable to a \"tornado like meteorological manifestation.\" 9 On February 15,1963, at 7:00 a.m., near Moe, in Victoria, a curious manifestation came down out of the eastern sky and hovered at a height between ,75 and 100 feet over a tree for a few seconds. This \"tornado\" was described by the witness, Charles Brew, in the following manner. It was about 25 feet in diameter and 9 or 10 feet high. The top section appeared to be a transparent dome of glass-like material from which protruded a 5 or 6 foot-high mast or aerial. This \"aerial\" appeared to be as thick as a broom- handle and resembled bright chrome. The top-portion of the disc itself was a battle-ship grey and appeared to be of a metallic lustre. The base or underside section glowed with a pale blue colour, and had \"scoop-like\" protruberances about 12 to 18 inches apart around the outside edge.\" This section rotated slowly at about one revolution per second. This spinning motion apparently caused the protuberances to generate a swishing noise, somewhat like a turbine noise, that was clearly audible not only to Brew, but also to his son Trevor, who was located inside the nearby shed near the diesel power milking machine units. After hovering for a few seconds, the object began to climb at roughly a 45 degree angle, continuing on its westward course. During the sighting, cattle and a pony in the farmers immediate vicinity reacted violently. The two farm dogs fled. Mr. Brew himself experienced a peculiar headache, which came on with the initial approach of the object. It became very severe and lasted for the rest of the day. The use of tablets did not subdue the headache. Officials from Air Force Intelligence and a scientist from the Meteorological Division of the Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) interviewed Mr. Brew and his son. 10 The other \"tornado\" sighting occurred at about 5:30 a.m. on July 19, 1965. Vaucluse resident Denis Crowe came upon an \"unknown\" resting on the sand of a nearby small north shore Sydney beach. Mr. Crowe became aware of a glow coming from the beach. Upon investigating, he saw that the glow emanated from a huge disc- shaped object resting on the beach. He described the object in the following manner. \"Its diameter appeared to be (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"(Australia, Continued) about 20 feet. I estimate its height at nine feet, including what appeared to be legs protruding from the bottom. Its rim was glowing a greenish blue, while the top and bottom halves were dullish silver-grey. A hollow in the top could have been a glass dome,\" He could hot make out any sign of movement within the object, nor any evidence of portholes ,or doors. When Crowe approached the object, to within 50 to 60 feet, it suddenly lifted off the ground. A yellow or orange glow appeared beneath the disc and a \"noise like air forcibly released from a balloon\" was noticed. After a \"take-off run\" of only 50 to 60 feet, the UFO climbed rapidly in the direction of Manly. Mr. Crow watched the object in flight for 10 seconds, before it disappeared in cloud over Manly. He said, \"I looked around hoping to see someone else who saw what I saw, but my only company was about a dozen or so dogs. While the object was stationary, they were all barking loudly at it. After it took off they were all strangely silent.\" A local geologist studied the site and indicated that vegetation there was dying. In the case of the Moe incident, the ground around the tree, over which the UFO hovered, was apparently similarly affected. Mr. Brew's cows refused to walk over the spot on the way to the milking bails. 11 If the RAAF would have us believe that what Mr. Brew and Mr. Crowe saw . were only \"tornadoes\" (and I am suggesting they were not), then these Australian variations of this meteorological manifestation deserve world attention of their uniqueness. If it were the case that examples of unsatisfactory \"possible causes\" for sightings that appear to be definite \"unknowns\" were isolated occur- rences, then the situation would perhaps be excusable. It is unfortunate that this is not the case. Although the total figures for the Department of Defence (Air Office) study from 1960 to 1976 suggest that the \"unknowns\" constitute about 4%, independent study indicates it to be higher. In a number of the cases that appear in the Defence Department Unusual Aerial Sightings Summaries, civilian organisations have also conducted investigations, and often the conclusions drawn are significantly different. Cressy (1960), Moe (1963), and Vaucluse (1965) are but a few examples of this problem. There are many more cases that we are aware of, but space precludes their mention here. Other studies should be consulted for more details. 12 The problem is compounded by the stated, policy of the RAAF that it will not enter into any discussion of any of its suggested causes for particular \"Unusual Aerial Sightings.\" An inspection of any of the Department's \"Unusual Aerial Sightings Sum- maries\" emphasizes the paucity of information supplied with each account. Therefore unless one is privy to Departmental files or there has been civilian involvement, the listed data defies critical inspection. While the above situation is a problem in itself, civilian investigation groups and individuals have also found that there, are a number of quite impressive RAAF \"UFO investi- gations\" that are never included in the Summaries made available to the general public. The Department of Defence has not volunteered why this should be the case, but consider the following two cases. Both were not included in the approprite Unusual Aerial Sightings Summaries and both on the basis of the information we have at our disposal would be classed as \"unknown.\" The first report involved two witnesses observing a UFO near the restricted United States Naval Communications Station at North West Cape in Western Australia. At about 1915 hours, on Thursday October 25, 1973, Lt. Commander M (USN) observed \"a large black, airborne object\" at a distance of approximately 5 mijes to the west at an altitude estimated at 2000 feet. Lt. Cmdr. M was driving south from the NAVCOMSTA towards the support township of Exmouth, along Murat Road. The officer indicated in a written statement that, \"After about 20- 25 seconds the craft accelerated at unbelievable speed and disappeared to the north. The following details were taken from a completed RAAF- Department of Defence Sighting Report Form: \"3. Object first observed to right (west), approx. 20° elvn., approx. 090° relative bearing, with 5° accuracy. 4. Apparent size : approx. same as moon when very high. 1-2\" at ca, 20\". 5. nearest approach - 20° & 090° 6. est. 2000' elvn. 7. Hovering at first, then accelerating beyond belief. 8. disappeared to the north, 45-50° elvn., approx. 165-170° 9. no noise or exhaust. 10. Special training - assoc. with naval aviation for 11 years as aerial gunner and radar operator. 11. have never experienced anything like it. 12. Details, if any were blurred as I did not have my glasses on, (vision 20/40-20/100) but I saw something beyond all doubt in my mind.\" The other witness, Fire Captain (USN) Bill I , provided the following details: At 1920 hrs, I was called by the P.O.W. to close the Officers club. I proceeded towards the club in the Fire Dept. pick-up 488, when my attention was drawn to a large black object, which at first I took to be a small cloud formation, due west of Area \"B\" (Area \"B\" is the location of the High Frequency Transmitter and between 2 to 3 miles due west of this point is located Mount Athol.- W.C.C.) Whilst travelling towards the Officers club I couldn't help but be attracted by this object's appearance. On alighting from pick-up 48#, I stood forseveral minutes & watched this black sphere hovering. The sky was clear & pale green-blue. No clouds were about whatsoever. The object was completely stationary except for a halo around the centre, which appeared to be either revolving or pulsating. After watching it for approx. 4 minutes, it suddenly took off at tremendous speed & disappeared in a northerly direction, in a few seconds. I consider this object to have been approx. 30 ft. in diameter, hovering at 1,000 ft. over the hills due west of the base. It was black, maybe due to looking in the direction of the setting sun. No lights appeared on it at any time. The second report occurred at about 10:30, on March 22, 1975. Two men and three girls travelling in a car along the Dingo Mount Flora road, in Northern Queensland, observed an (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"(Australia, Continued) object just off the road, apparently hovering just above the ground in a gravel storage area. The people turned the car around for another look, and observed a row of dull flashing white to yellow lights, apparently attached to a large mass. Above this structure, a circular mass was apparent, consisting of several rings of blue-green lights, with a central black disc. Some of the witnesses noticed a \"pole\" connecting the two masses, and four \"legs\" could be faintly discerned. As the witnesses' vehicle drew to a halt, the lights increased in brilliance and blinked off and on rapidly, and a very loud bang, \"like a shotgun\" was heard. .The witnesses retreated in the car, and the upper circular mass seemed to turn with them \"as if it was watching them.\" The group quickly left the area, and shortly after, the men subsequently returned with a construction worker. By then the object had disappeared, but strange ground effects were noticed in the gravel storage area at the point where the object had been seen. Police, and subsequently investigators from Townsville Air Force Base, confirmed the presence of three oval-shaped areas, one roughly circular area, and a rectangular area, freshly impacted in the gravel storage area. The report of the investigative RAAF officer noted that he was \"unable to explain the nature of the alleged object, or the cause of the unusual ground markings which may or may not have been associated with the sighting.\" I have copies of the written statements and sketches of the witnesses, the police- officer's report, the RAAF officers detailed report, and the RAAF photos taken at the site. The data indicates that something \"unknown\" was seen and did leave behind the trace marks in the gravel storage area. During the years several civilian investigators and researchers have had a variety of success in extracting documented data from the RAAF- Department of Defence (Air Office) on \"Unusual Aerial Sightings\" or UFOs, in more popular parlance. Edgar Jarrold 15 , Dr. J. Allen Hynek 1 *, Harry Griesberg 17 and others, have over the years had the opportunity to assess to a limited degree the extent to which the RAAF has involved itself in the UFO question. In recent years, the Department of Defence (Air Office) has consented \"to provide individual reports to genuinely interested parties with names removed in order to protect the anonymity of those concerned,\" but, \"Although the RAAF files on unusual aerial sightings are unclassified,\" civilians are still unable to gain general access to the archival files for research purposes. 18 Fortunately the situation is slowly changing. The RAAF is slowly becoming aware of the fact that there are competent civilian researchers who are conducting serious investigations into the UFO subject, and in recent years there have been subtle changes in policy. The author has been receiving copies of RAAF case documents relating to \"physical trace\" incidences for inclusion in his UFO \"ground trace\" catalogue of Australian cases. Documentation on RAAF studies of \"UFO photos\" has also been forthcoming. 12 All this documentation has enabled more detailed understanding of the involvment of the RAAF in the UFO controversy in Australia, and only time will tell whether there will be further revelations.

These incidents included sightings dating back to 1962 of two kinds of beings and several types of UFOs. A surge of activity began in the fall of 1977 and continued through the spring of 1978. Scattered incidents are still being reported to this investigator. During the period of intense. activity different individuals reported seeing one or more types of small, white-suited, helmeted figures. During 4 days from 9-12 January 1978 the major sightings of a UFO(s) occurred on the Gould property. It is possible that a single UFO landed on the property the night of January 9, remaining for two days before departing on the morning of January 12. However, the exact sequence of events is confused. On January 9 and 10 there were observations of a white- suited figure in the vicinity of a UFO; therefore these sightings are Type C in the Humanoid Study Group's system. Only the January series and two well-documented humanoid encount- ers in April 1978 are discussed in this article. The other events are older, less well documented or vaguer. For more details the reader is referred to the full report on file at MUFON headquarters. Raymond Fowler referred this case to me and aided in the investigation. Synopsis The Gould family members are Theresa (aged 50) and Thomas (52) and their three children, Allan (21), Nancy (20) and Douglas (14); ages are in 1978. Thomas is a self-employed carpenter who is an emigrant from Canada. He served in the RCAF for 4 years as a medic. Theresa was born and lived in her parents' home for 42 years before she and Tom built their home in 1967, where most of the events occurred. They recently sold the house! Theresa's mother still lives next door in the family home. Nearly eight acres of land extending to the north of these homes are in the family estate. On December 17, 1977, the granddaughter of Mrs. Campbell, Theresa's mother, and her family arrived for a 2-month visit. Carol Ann (24) T. (name confidential) and her husband Giles (nicknamed Jay - 26) have two children Jenny (6) and John (4). Giles is in the Army in Texas. On the evening of Monday, January 9, 1978, Douglas, Mrs. Campbell and her granddaughter's family were in the Campbell house. The other Gould's were home next door. Doug and the children were put to bed between 7:30 and 8 p.m. At about 7:30 Nancy and Theresa Gould were sitting in their living room when, through the dining room window to the east, Theresa saw a large, yellowish-white light angling toward the ground, the main light may have had a small light in the rear (Theresa later described seeing 3 round lights.) The light(s) seemed to be approaching from the NE and remained in view at least 15 seconds. Nancy, who saw the object when it was closer, described a yellow-orange ball of light. She ran out the back door in time to see the object disappear behind trees some distance behind the house (azimuth: 15-30°). She said the light seemed to wink out as it went behind the trees. No glow was seen; total observation time was about 20 seconds. She returned to the house, recorded the time in her diary as 7:37 p.m.. and called a friend on the phone. Five minutes later when she tried the phone again it was dead and didn't work for 20 minutes. During this period Mrs. Campbell tried calling the Gould's from her home, to no avail. In the Campbell house, the children had been in bed about 10-15 minutes when John called out. Giles went upstairs to John's bedroom (each child was in a separate room). John said, \"Daddy, there's a man over there. And he was trying to touch me.\" The boy reported seeing a white figure in the room at the foot of the bed. His father naturally assumed the boy had been dreaming and told him to go back to sleep. • As Giles left the room, he heard a knock in the other bedroom, which should have been unoccupied. He went in to see who it was and heard a knock on a window. Pulling the curtain back, he saw a white-suited figure atop the roof on the back porch. The porch adjoins the house on the first floor. The . figure was about 2-3 feet away and hooded by what seemed like a mask. Giles looked at a pair of eyes which just stared back. He dropped the curtain and went downstairs. The night was windy and the porch door was banging. Carol mentioned the noise, so Giles went to the door to check. He went out on the porch and had to kick the porch door at its base to keep it closed. Turning to come back in, he noticed apparently the same figure standing just outside the door, which is all glass. No one else saw figures that night. January 10 was a day of high, broken clouds. Snow flurries occurred in the Boston area, but the Gould's remembered no large snow fall that day. During early January there were only a few inches of snow cover at any one time. The first large snow didn't occur until January when inches fell. It is probable that if the sky were mostly cloudy, the lighting was .flat on that day. Tom Gould spent much of that day working on the property. At 2:30 p.m. he was chopping wood in an area due north of their house when he \" (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"(Middleton, Continued) spotted a white-suited figure standing on a path beside a tree about 90 feet away. The figure stood 4% feet tall, wore a squarish helmet in which were set two dark eyes or eyeholes. (See Fig. 1.) It had broad shoulders with arms which hung down the sides. The being's apparently gloved hands had 3 digits (\"looked like mittens\"), resembling a thumb, finger, and a thicker part. The hands and helmet were battleship gray. (Investigator's note: These details are a composite of Tom's observations of the being, based on at least 7 separate encounters. Tom claims to have seen this or a similar figure 4 or 5 times during December 1977, or a few weeks before this incident. The figure was always alone; however, Tom always had the vague impression of a second figure near the first that he couldn't quite perceive. On January 10 it is unlikely that Tom saw much detail of a white figure standing 90 feet away against a white background of a flatly lit, overcast day.) The being stood staring at Tom. Tom spoke in English and got no reaction. But when he spoke in French, he thought it moved slightly. Tom was unafraid of the being (this not being the first encounter) and continued chopping firewood for l-l l / 2 hours glancing at the being occasionally. It never moved. (In explanation of this apparent nonchalance, Tom told me that by then the figures were a common sight to him and that chasing them had always proven futile.) Upon finishing the chopping, Tom got in his pickup and drove down the road a short way. He looked again for the being but it was gone. (The area is hilly with lots of trees and shrubs. It is easy to loose sight of a small object even nearby.) Then he noticed what looked like a huge boulder about 150 feet away down a slope in a partially wooded area. (See Fig. 2.) He stopped the truck, got out and walked some distance around the area to look for the being and to get a better vantage point on the strange object. The object was sitting on the ground; \"it was egg-shaped, wider at the front than....at the back. It's got little windows all over the sides of it....The window looked like a frog's eye — it had a hood-like over the window,\" said Tom. Later Nancy reported the windows as round and bubble-shaped; they seemed to protrude from the sides of the craft and were adjacent to one another. The dark gray surface of the UFO was dull and rough, like the surface of a brick. No seams or protrusions were evident. Measurements in the area indicated that the UFO was about 40 feet long by 13% feet wide across its nearer or wider end, and possibly 10 feet high (an undetermined portion lay in the snow or depressing the ground surface). The being had been approximately 300 feet to the west of the UFO. I investigated the \"landing area\" on April 23, or 3% months later; at that time it was well overgrown with brush and small trees. There was no evidence of a depression or environmental damage except for broken limbs on two trees. These two trees were the tallest in what would have been the UFO's path of vertical descent. I was the one who first noticed these broken limbs, and pointed them out to Tom. He stated he was sure they were broken by the UFO because they had not been broken before the sighting, and the wood had appeared green and clean-cut the day after the sighting. I questioned him closely on this point. He admitted that he could not be sure he had been in the area of the \"landing\" within several days to a week before January 10. Tom was afraid to approach very close to the UFO, and eventually returned home. He is uncertain when he told the family about his experience, but remembers that upon doing so they laughed and thought it was a joke. There is a discrepancy about whether the next sighting was the same day or the next day. On probably the following day (January 11) Tom was again cutting wood on the lot when he again saw the UFO sitting in the same place. In late afternoon he got first Allan, then Nancy to look at the object. Nancy remembered viewing the object about dusk. She thought the time was about 4:30 to 5 p.m.; sunset was about 4:50 p.m. Allan, whose vision is effected by glare, thought that the sun was reflecting off the snow causing glare. He could only see what looked like a big boulder. Tom would not allow the Figure 1. Figure observed by Tom Gould Figure 2. Boulder-like object on ground youths to approach closer than 150 feet to the UFO. Nancy was unable to see much detail because it was dusk, and the UFO was a distance away partially obscured by trees and brush. Even so she claims to have seen 7 windows on the UFO once her eyes focussed on it. On the following day (probably January 12), Allan saw a daylight disc ascend from the property. He was in the bathroom about 10 a.m. when he suddenly observed a UFO about 100 feet in the air over a rise at an azimuth of 15°. Its bearing was approximately the same from the house as the location where the landed object had been but 8"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"(Middleton, Continued) ' apparently closer to the house. The object had a smooth, dull, steel-gray or silver surface, and was shaped like two discs pressed together, the bottom being flatter than the top. Four long legs extended from the underside (Allan remembered seeing only 2 legs but assumed there were 4). The legs extended below the rise along Allan's sightline. As he watched, the object slowly rose vertically. He quickly ran outside, but saw nothing more of it. He later found what he called \"pod marks\" in the clay-like soil near the rise. Only one of these alleged marks was visible the day I visited the site, April 23. The hole was 4% inches deep, 6 inches wide at the top and lay on an inclined portion of ground. It lay near a partially buried can. The immediate area is open with a dirt access road running through it. The topsoil has been removed from some of this area; what remains is clay- like and dry. The remains of an old hog pen lie atop the rise. I had Allan stand where he remembered the. other holes and measured the distances. The result was a roughly rectangular area. Allan's idea was that these distances were the spacing between the four legs of the craft as it rested on the ground. The investigators consider these events to be the most important and best documented. However, a host of attendent events involving both entities and UFOs were reported before and after this period. Two of these involving humanoids are discussed below. Two April Incidents On the morning of Sunday, April 9, 1978, Doug and his cousin, D.P. (name confidential), were riding his minibike near the ruined pig house. Suddenly they glimpsed two large white heads through the low brush about 30-35 feet away. Only the heads were visible; their attitude was such that they seemed to be crouching behind the brush. Their faces were light gray with large, wrap- around dark blue eyes. Their heads were of normal size with no hair. The youths were frightened and quickly left the area. About 2 p.m. Doug and Allan and their cousins R.P. and D.P. returned to the same area. While sitting and talking, they had the feeling they were being watched. Doug and Allan glimpsed several beings that faded from sight or moved too rapidly to be studied. R.P., however, saw at least one being and gave the most complete description. R.P. and D.P. were sitting together when R.P. saw a figure standing about 10-15 feet away. It was seen in profile (See Fig. 3) and about her height, which is 5 ft 3 in. The head had an unusually large posterior projection and appeared to be encased in a clear, round helmet. She noticed a large, dark oval eye, a nose slit, but no mouth or ears. No hands or feet could be seen at the ends of flaring sleeves and pants. A belt with a dark central band, vertical stripes, and a black buckle encircled the waist. Recovering from her initial shock, R.P. yelled, jumped up and ran after the being. It quickly retreated with its back to her and was lost to sight in the brush. The others did not see too many details, and particularly remembered no facial details. Allan noticed that an odor like sulphur pervaded the area. It is interesting that, except for R.P.'s account, only vague glimpses of figures were reported despite there being four witnesses in an open area in broad daylight. R.P. saw the same or a similar entity about 10 days later on April 19. That night the four cousins were play- ing in the Gould basement when R.P. happened to glance at a window, which was at eye level. From only a foot away she observed a white face staring back GAP BETWEEN FACE AND HELMET SUN GLINTED OFF HELMET Figure 4. R.P. Face observed by Figure 3. Figure observed by R.P. at her! It was oval with vertical nose slits and a narrow mouth (in contrast to the earlier sighting; see Fig. 4). The eyes were large, slanted, and gold in color. A transparent helmet may have covered the head. She turned to yell at her companions, but when she looked back the face was gone. R.P. thinks the being must have been in a prone position on the ground, since ground level is only inches below the bottom of the window.

Education: Bachelor's Degree in Art, Master's Degree in Art and currently working on a Specialist's Degree in Art. WEATHER CONDITIONS: Less than 2 tenths cloud cover, high scattered clouds in the west, temperature 82°, wind 6 knots from the west, southwest. The sighting took place August 21, 1979 at 1930 C.D.T. over an asphalt road in front of her residence which is located 5 miles southwest of Sedalia, Missouri. The sun was low in the west with a darkening sky to the south and east. No stars were visible as the sky was quite light at the time of the observation. Mrs. B. was leaving to go to a bridge party and as she backed the car to the north to turn in the driveway she saw the object. The automobile was facing south and the object was bearing 165° when first seen. It appeared to be over the asphalt road at a distance of just under 150 feet. The witness estimated the altitude as about 40 feet as it was some 10 feet above power poles along the road. Mrs. B. described the sighting to me on August 28,1979: \"I was in the garage, I backed out and started to turn around, and just as I had backed around I saw this big sphere. It didn't appear to be moving, at that point. It was just above the trees and at no time did any tree obscure it. It seemed to be stationary or at least moving very, very slowly. It appeared to be an enormous white sphere — I would say about the size of a school bus (as it would appear at the road). I became really excited because it was evident that it was something most unusual. I gunned the car and shot down the lane (a distance of 0.2 mile). I got almost down to the road and it started moving faster, still fairly slow. I started to turn on the road to follow it, and just as I got on the road and started to go after it, it was over the creek area (approximately 200 feet from the witness) and it lifted up just as an aircraft would do to miss the trees beyond and then it just shot straight up at tremendous speed and disappeared in the sky. (I drove from the point of the first observation to the point of disappearance — the resulting time was 1 minute and 20 seconds). \"I have a 35mm camera but it was in the house. My husband was asleep and I don't know if the dogs reacted. The windows were up on the car so I don't know if there was any sound. As it was moving down the road, at first it was huge and very bright, it was pulsating at about one second intervals, as it would pulsate, the circular part that was so bright would get a little smaller and the fingers of light around its edge could be seen. The light fingers did not appear to be projected but just there in the glow and they were blue- white. It would get bigger again and you couldn't see them. The spikes appeared at what would have been the back of the sphere. When it accelerated to move away vertically, you could see the spikes and the whole thing glowed brighter just as it took off.\" Interview Phillips: The moon is visible now, in looking at it (half moon) did the objects glow as bright as the moon does now? B. It was brighter than that. Phillips: You feel sure that it was over the road and not beyond it? B. Yes, because when I was at the road I could see it down the road and just above it. I could see the glow from it on the road surface. Phillips: Was it as wide as the road? B. It was as wide as the ditches. (The road is 20 feet wide, the ditches are 28 (continued on next page) (Middleton, Continued) Evaluations This series of incidents taken as a whole is complicated and unique in my -experience with UFO/humanoid reports. It is unique in the combination of bizarre events occurring over years. These events included landed UFOs, two types of humanoids, cattle mutilation, poltergeist activity, strange odors, sounds and devices. Yet all these phenomena have been reported in various combinations in other UFO 10 reports. The testimony of the Gould's seemed sincere. Each family member was sincere and concerned in reporting details. Successive interviews revealed no basic discrepancies in the stories. Our character reference checks showed that the Gould's were considered honest people though possibly prone to exaggeration. In conclusion, it is my opinion that strange events did occur in Middleton. The January incidents and observations of the white-suited humanoid(s) are especially noteworthy because they were reported by several people, sometimes in groups and at close range during daytime. The witnesses to these events included three groups outside of the immediate Gould family. It is highly unlikely that all of these people were lying or hoaxing, hallucinating, or misinterpreting natural or man-made phenomena."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"(Glowinq Sphere, Continued) feet apart.) Phillips: When it started to climb, how long did it take it to disappear? B. Just a couple of seconds, very, very fast and it was gone, just a dot of light in the sky. Phillips: Were you sure it was generating its own glow and not reflecting light? B. Yes, the sun was very low and it was much brighter than reflected light. Phillips: Was the motion smooth? B. Yes and level. Phillips: As the front section was toward the setting sun, was there any brighter area visible on the object? B. No, it was the same brightness all over, the sun was very low. Phillips: Did it seem to be brighter toward the center? B: No....it was the same all over, no other colors, except it seemed as if when it was really bright, there was a kind of golden glow and as it dimmed it had a kind of bluish tone.. Phillips: The spikes....were they blue? Were they projected from the sphere? B: Yes, they were blue, I couldn't really tell if they were projected as a light beam would be. They just became visible when the glow dimmed. They didn't actually seem to move out. Phillips: In looking at this thing from the side, could you see any spikes facing you, coming out of the side or front? B: No, it seemed like they were mostly in back. Phillips: Could you still see the spikes when you were looking at the rear as it moved down the road? B: Yes....when it dimmed; when it brightened, I couldn't see them. Phillips: When it was over the road and down the road from you, how large did it appear in relation to the road itself? B: Larger, when it was bright it was over each ditch (28 feet) and when it dimmed and I could see the actual sphere it was about as wide as the road surface (20 feet). Phillips: Did it appear as a different shape when viewed from the back or the side? B: No, it was the same-so it must have been a perfect sphere, a globe. Phillips: In looking at this, did you have the impression that it was made up of a cloud-like material? B: No, it was not hazy or cloud-like. In fact when the glow dimmed it had the appearance of metal, like aluminum. When the glow was bright, it had fuzzy edges around the outer edge; when it dimmed I could see a metal sphere with well defined edges. The spikes were extending from the metal sphere into the glow which covered them with brightness. Phillips: Did you have your car lights on? B:No. Phillips: Radio? B: No. Phillips: Did you notice anything unusual about the car? B: No, it was running fine, normally. Phillips: Did your husband report anything unusual or did the dogs bark? B: No, Karl was asleep, one of the dogs doesn't hear and I was in the car with the windows up. I ran into the house and asked him if he had seen it, but he was asleep. Phillips: Did the dogs seem upset, different? Phillips: Did you see any external light sources, any brighter areas, darker areas? B: No, I didn't see any, just the glowing sphere, same brightness all over. Phillips: Prior to this event, what did you think of flying saucers, UFOs? B: Well, I thought it was a possibility, why should we be so conceited to think we are the only life forms in the universe? Phillips: Has this event changed your opinion? B: It strengthened it. Summary: The witness is certainly one trained to observe and retain. She seemed most honest and answered questions factually to the best of her knowledge. The sphere was observed in daylight (not full sun) the sun angle was excellent in relation to the witness and object. She was within 150 feet of the object which was some 40 feet above the road moving with a slow smooth motion to the point of acceleration which was immediate and vertical. Estimated.diameter of 20 feet for the actual sphere and 28 feet for the entire glowing area would be quite accurate as she had the road for comparison. In recreating, the events in real time, the observation lasted for one minute and twenty seconds. MUFON 103 OLDTOWNE RD. SEGUIN.TX 78155 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"HUMANOID CASE WITH \"MESSAGE' By Richard Hall (Note: The identity and exact location of the witness, a security guard in California, has been disguised in this report, for reasons that will become clear later. This article is directly quoted from the MUFON investigator's report.) On September 12, 1978, MUFON's International Director, Walter Andrus, received a most interesting letter from a sober-sounding young man in California. The immediate countryside in the lower portion of the large San Joaquin valley that extends up and down the central part of the state is industrialized, mainly in agriculture and oilfields. The main crop is cotton, with the fields stretching for miles, as far as the eye can see. Citrus fruit orchards are also quite common. The one large orange grove relating to this particular UFO incident stretches for miles, with roads criss- crossing through it in neat patterns much like the street patterns of many small towns. Instead of houses, however, it is solid orange trees. This particular ranch entails many thousands of acres of cotton, citrus trees, and vegetables. A 26-year-old security guard for the large farm related his fascinating and unusual story to Walt Andrus in a lengthy letter. Walt contacted this investigator, and I went to work. To begin with, I was impressed with this young man's sincerity, his apparent honesty, and his concern that he was unable to locate any other witnesses. I am by nature a cautious and suspicious person myself and frequently approach such cases with \"tongue in cheek,\" having run into enough hoaxes and fraudulent cases in my 22 years of investigation to give me adequate insight and recognition for such incidents. After spending over 3 uours with Carl (pseudonym) and making a tour of the area in question, plus several phone calls, I was quite satisfied as to his honesty. Briefly, he is a religious person, does not drink or use drugs. He has 2 years of college with a major in Environmental Technology, 2 years in the Army as a sniper and demolition expert. He is married and has three small children. Checking with a couple of local acquaintances also strengthened my satisfaction as to his credibility. He also had spent a considerable amount of money on newspaper ads and radio time in his determined quest for additional confirmation of the sighting, which he really could not affort. Fearing ridicule and harrassment from friends and co- workers, Carl kept this story to himself until he simply had to tell someone who would help ease his frustration and anxiety. I interviewed Carl in the early morning of October 24, 1978. The incident occurred at 8:50 p.m. on the night of February 27, 1977, while Carl was patroling the large orange grove area of the farm. Visibility was 10 to 20 miles, a slight south by'southwest wind, and the temperature was about 60 degrees. Patroling west along the orange grove roads in his radio- equipped company car, Carl suddenly noticed a bright light in the clear night sky to the southeast. Since there is night crop dusting and other occasional aircraft activity in the immediate area, his first thought was that the bright light was a plane. His estimate of distance was about 2 miles at an elevation of 7,000 to 8,000 feet, and it was moving at about the speed of a desc°nding aircraft — roughly 80 m.p.h. The object started to descend in its northwest direction of travel. Still thinking it was a plane in trouble, Carl proceeded in the direction he assumed (3) 'MALE~\"ALTENS~I~W Drawn by a police artist for MUFON the craft would come down, working his way hastily through the maze of orchard roads. He watched along each intersection for flames, a flash, or sign of a crash. There was none. Roughly judging about where the object should have come down, he turned south and drove about 2,500 feet. As he approached the next intersection he was aware of some large, dark object sitting right in the middle of the road in front of him, and about 250 feet away. Suddenly lights came on across the bottom of a large oval-shaped craft. These red, blue, and orange lights lit up the roadway to some extent and revealed the general shape of the strange machine. Carl eased the car slowly forward to get closer. It was quite dark in the orchard area, but there was a partial moon off to the left in the sky, giving some light. (continued on next page) 12"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"(Humanoids, Continued) Carl had been using his powerful hand- held spotlight searching for a possible aircraft hanging up in the trees. As these colored lights came on he stared in amazement through his windshield at the strange sight in front of him. At the same time his lights all dimmed way down and the car's engine died. The radio began to squeal at a high pitch, mixed with static. He turned down the volume and sat there staring, \"having a bunch of thoughts,\" as he put it. He got out of the car and started walking toward the object, which was resting on four telescoping legs about 80 feet in front of him across the intersection. There was an open doorway with light coming from within the craft and a ladder down to the ground. The bottom of the craft was high enough off the ground that he could have walked under it without hitting his head. As Carl approached, unafraid but curious as to what he had encountered, his attention was drawn to the right at the edge of the orange trees. There he saw two persons, one with his arms full or oranges and the other almost obscured by the tree branches handing the first one more oranges! The alien holding his armful of oranges turned and looked at Carl, emitting a strange, but brief squeaking sound. The other one who was handing the oranges to him suddenly stepped out from behind the tree branches and they both looked at him, but in a most unconcerned way as if to say, \"It's just one of those Earthlings,\" ho-hum! Carl described it as a \"care less\" attitude. I asked .Carl if they were picking ripe or green oranges, but he said at that distance and in the night light emanating only from the craft and partial moon, it was impossible to tell. It was about this time that Carl noticed a rabbit crouched down, not far from the aliens, either cowering or too frightened to move. (Rabbits are quite a common sight in the orchards.) Its ears were laid back along its furry body, and it simply squatted there against the ground, not moving. Apparently the two \"orange pickers\" noted Carl observing the rabbit as they too looked and one pointed at the animal, then to each other, nodding in -BOTTOM VIEW- (Overhead) Chinese-like' white markings g Direction of travel Blue lights Black rectangular area Red lights 35\" (4).Landing gear spots an unconcerned fashion. Strangely enough, and possibly as the result of fright or radiation from the craft, the rabbit let out a shriek too, but it was audibly different and recognizable to Carl as coming from the animal, not the beings. Carl cautiously walked about 5 feet closer when he noticed two more people, standing in the lighted doorway of the strange vehicle. One definitely appeared to be female, with obviously different body contours. She was more slight of build than her male companion and a few inches shorter, but had an obvious bustline and wider hips. All were wearing identical golden colored, tight fitting jumpsuits. The material looked metallic, was shiny, and appeared to be in one piece, which even came over the head like a tight fitting hood. Only the lower portion of the face was exposed. The skin color and facial features appeared to be that of Homo sapiens. Only the eyes were not discernible, as they were covered with rather large black shiny goggles. Carl estimated the males were about 5 ft. 7 in. tall and perhaps weighed 140 Ibs. The Humanoids It has been suggested that these suits provide protection from radiation emanating from the craft, possibly only while the door is open, or the occupants are outside. Further speculation is that the suits may be protection against earthly weaponry as well. The goggles gave the appearance of shiny black White bottom light (2) metal or obsidian. When the aliens turned their heads slightly, the goggles reflected with a sort of metallic sheen, as if they were made of fine mesh or screen. Each wore boots and gloves that blended in with the suits except for a slight broken line, possibly indicating a separation area. The only other obvious feature was a heavy black belt around each waist with a small holster- like holder containing a thick tube of some kind, resembling a black flashlight or police mace tube. Carl definitely felt this device on the right side of their belts could have been a defensive weapon of some sort. Each one had a necklace-like emblem around their neck which did not move in any way but seemed to be fastened to the suit. These were oval in shape and about 2&\" x 2\" with a large diamond shape in the center. The female's was silver colored, the other three were black. One of the two aliens on the ground walked with a slight limp. Their walk and general strides were very similar to ours. They all seemed to handle themselves very assuredly, precise, with a certain amount of gracefulness. The limping alien seemed to be attempting to slightly shake the soft orchard dirt and mud from his feet. The orchard is watered frequently so the ground stays soft and moist most of the time. About this time the female put her (continued on next page) 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"(Humanoids, Continued) hand up in a stop gesture, indicating that Carl should not come any closer. He immediately received a strong telepathic message in his mind: \"Stop, don't come any closer, you'll do yourself harm. We have no intention of harming you.\" Carl stopped in his hesitant advance. The lights of the craft had came on as he stepped out of the car, as if they were anticipating a possible need to depart in a hurry if more Earthlings should appear, or hostile action should develop. The craft was completely dark when he first approached it in his car, now it seemed ready to take off on a moment's notice. The various colored lights were on, underneath and on the ends. A white band of light glowed around the circumference of the entire craft, as did the red-orange pulsing dome on top. Carl had put his hand on the gun at his hip, a Smith and Wesson 41 Magnum revolver. She spoke again to him telepathically: \"Are you afraid? Do you feel the need to defend yourself?\" There were no verbally spoken words, the communication was entirely telepathic. Everything Carl started to say with his voice, she anticipated. He realized he was thinking what he was going to say and she was reading his mind with an immediate reply already formed for him. With the mind communication going back and forth, he began to formulate a visual picture of her in his mind. Behind those large welder-type goggles was a beautiful feminine face with slightly oriental eyes, much like a Filipina. He also came to the conclusion that she was in command. Her neck medallion was different and she was giving orders to the other three male crew members. The communication between the aliens themselves seemed to be in the way of brief \"squeaks.\" Carl compared the sound to the high-pitched squelch of a C.B. radio. The communications transceiver in his company car was of this type, but was not on the C.B. channels. The female's voice or squeak was slightly different and higher in pitch than her male counterparts. The two picking oranges had briefly \"squeaked\" to each other. They now were standing beside the craft on the ground staring at Carl, one with his 14 arms full of the freshly picked oranges. The female squeaked at the two on the ground. They looked up at her, and as if commanded to do so immediately came up the ladder and into the craft. As they climbed the ladder, quite gracefully and without using their hands for assistance, the two in the doorway stepped aside to let them through and they disappeared into the ship with their cargo of oranges. The female and her male companion then resumed their positions in the doorway to continue mental conversation with the Earthman. The male was intently watching Carl as if in anticipation of hostile action. He never took his eyes off of Carl. Part of the time he had one hand behind him, the rest of the time beside him near the holstered tube at his belt. Carl commented to me that he felt if he had made an aggressive move toward his own gun or toward the craft, that he would have been stopped in his tracks by some defensive method. She asked again, telepathically: \"Do you feel the need to defend yourself?\" Carl said he didn't understand, and she immediately pointed to his revolver. He said, \"No, not really.\" Then he took his hand away from the gun and put it in front of him where they could easily see it. This pretty much convinced him that the device on their belts may have been some sort of defensive weapon. The mental communication continued. Carl asked her where they came from. She answered that they were from a distant world and were on a scouting mission. She told him they were concerned about the many problems on this planet. She also said our government has one of their craft which had crashed in the desert, and also have four of the occupants but two others are living among us. She commented no further about this except that our government could not understand how the craft flew or how its defensive systems operated. She said we would never understand it. Carl said he had a million questions he wanted to ask, but couldn't get them out. The female leader said they would return but gave no indication as to when. A few other things were briefly discussed, and then she said the first verbally spoken words during the entire confrontation. In an average but rather metallic-sounding female voice, she said \"Goodbye\" in English, as if it were an effort. She and her male companion then stepped back, the ladder retracted into the lower doorway area or just below it, the door slid shut from left to right, both without making any sound. When the door was closed it fit so tightly that no seams or edges could be detected. One could not tell where the door had been. The Craft Now the dome on top and the white band around the entire craft's circumference brightened up. Each end light glowed, one yellowish green, the other red. Two white lights, one on each end between the landing gear legs, glowed white. Two small blue lights and two more small red lights were located underneath in the corners of the rectangular area. The main portion of the entire craft appeared to be made out of dull aluminum or steel-colored metal. The dome on top rapidly became very bright and was still a reddish- orange in color. The craft sat there for a few seconds, then it started to lift off. The legs retracted back into the hull in sections, similar to an auto antenna or old-fashioned hand telescope, completely disappearing into the bottom of the ship. The craft just hovered in a fixed spot 8 or 9 feet in the air for about 4 or 5 seconds. Carl then felt a slight wind emitting from under the craft and its breeze caused a definite circle of dust and sand to spread out underneath the craft, leaving an obvious but slightly built-up ring of the sand material directly underneath. It was as if the craft had a downward push of air or exhaust as part of a lifting effort. It then raised straight upward 60 to 70 feet and circled around Carl in a counter-clockwise direction. In this attitude overhead, he got a good look at the bottom of the vehicle, noting again the various light positions, the retracted landing gear spots, and the unusual Chinese-like markings on the bottom rectangular center section. He also got a better look at the overall shape of the entire vehicle from this perspective, which he described as football-shaped with somewhat pointed ends. The two large (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"(Humanoids, Continued) white lights illuminated the underside of the craft, and the ground to some extent. After the craft circled the witness it suddenly shot off at tremendous speed straight up, but slightly in a northeast direction. It disappeared from sight in about 8 to 10 seconds. As it departed the ship did not glow, but retained the same lights shining as when it hovered. As it circled and departed, its line of flight was end-wise, like the flight of a football being \"passed\" by a player. It made no sound whatever. When the alien vehicle had disappeared from sight, Carl stated that he really felt depressed. He wanted to go with them and said he would have gone immediately had they asked him. He was thinking of the fantastic technology he had just witnessed and could well imagine an elaborate futuristic world far better than our own. He got back in the car and just sat there for a few minutes, with the immediate events running through his mind. Glancing forward toward the orange trees, he noted the rabbit was still in the same spot. It hadn't moved. He turned the ignition key on and the car started right up. The lights came on and everything seemed normal as if nothing had happened. He reported in on the radio that all was well, afraid to mention anything about the UFO experience. During the encounter, he was not the least bit frightened. He was somewhat apprehensive but more curious and fascinated than anything else. Afterwards he stated that he was scared, when he began thinking about it all. He didn't sleep well for several nights, was nauseated, had diarrhea and headaches for about 3 days. During the encounter, he recalled being conscious of the hair on the back of his head and neck standing up. He was concerned if these physical effects, especially the illness, could have been the result of some type of radiation emanating from the strange ship. The thought also crossed his mind that the overall jump suits and goggles worn by the aliens might have been their protection against this. Carl wishes to this day that he had a camera with him. He carries one now in hopeful anticipation of a possible second encounter. (Some further discussion of the sighting content is deleted here.-- Editor) The Message The important message for all of us is that this case is a hoax — a confessed hoax. Since \"Carl\" did confess, and seemed contrite about the trouble he caused MUFON investigators, we have elected not to identify him. The story content fit so well with other cases, and the reporter seemed so \"sincere\" and in a responsible position, that we were nearly taken in. His mistake was that he couldn't keep his story straight in communications with three separate MUFON investigators — date, circumstances, or descriptive details — and when the three compared notes, the discrepancies were glaring. But this didn't happen until the report presented here was already being typemarked for publication. In retrospect, the \"contactee\" elements (visions of a better world, extraterrestrials concerned about our welfare) might have been a tip-off; these elements are not present in the typical humanoid case. When the main investigator confronted Carl with the now apparent contradictions, he confessed. The reasons for committing a hoax that he gave to Walt Andrus in a letter postmarked May 16, 1979, are interesting and instructive: Ihave some things that have been . weighing pretty heavy on me. First off — all my life I had been a nobody, unimportant and all. The reason I am writing this is to say I lied about my encounter of the III kind. I wanted to be important. I find that because of my religious background I want to clear the air and stop something that has gone too far. My encounter is and was a \"hoax.\" My personal conscience will not let me live like this.... God has forgiven me and I hope you also can....Tell * * * I'm sorry and I don't want to see him because I lied. I am not psychologically deranged but just wanted some attention. Please forgive me, that's all I ask. Carl has been invited to give Journal readers (anonymously) a more complete explanation of his reasons for perpetrating a hoax and where he got the idea content of his story (for example, what portions were \"borrowed\" from the literature and what portions fabricated outright). We feel that further analysis of the \"anatomy of a hoax\" would be educational for everyone, and that the act of providing additional insight would help Carl to expiate his guilt. He has not yet responded. A copy of this article will be sent to him with a repeat request. PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION Psychologists and psychiatrists who are MUFON members or subscribers are invited to help with investigation and analysis of \"abduction\" reports, in which witnesses claim either conscious recollection — or the story emerges under hypnosis — of forcible abduction on board seeming craft manned by more or less humanoid \"beings.\" Sometimes the beings are communi- cative, sometimes not. Medical examination of the abductees is a common theme. An interesting question in this connection is whether the psychological/psychiatric literature includes parallel or similar case histories of psychoses or fantasies in which the beings may be described as angelic, or demonic, or even as \"monsters\" of one sort or another. Is there literature bearing on claimed abduction or forcible detention of any type, with or without \"vehicles?\" If so, please submit case histories or references. Letters to the Editor commenting on articles published in the Journal will be considered for publication. Please restrict comments to 300 words maximum. If you have information that cannot be expressed in a letter, we will consider publishing a longer article if submitted in manuscript form (typed, doublespaced). 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"BOOK REVIEWS Plethora of Pictures from Pleiades Question: to a collector of books on the subject of unidentified flying objects, what's better to possess than a fancy picture book about mankind's latest so-called contact with alien cosmonauts? Answer: more such fancy picture books. The \"photo-journal\" at issue here - UFO ... Contact from the Pleiades, hot off the mail-order presses of Genesis III Productions, Ltd. (P.O. Box 32067, Phoenix, AZ 85064; price: $27.95) - indeed is a prize for any UFOphiliac's bookshelf. Starting with superb slick-paper stock, full-color photographs, avant-garde graphics/ typography, and the cryptic textual description of a Swiss farmer's alleged manifold contact with inhabitants of planetary systems in or near the constellation Pleiades, this teaser (Volume I) of a continuing contact story dating back to January 28, 1975, ends up by posing more questions than its sales brochure hints at answering. For one thing: after several years of playing host to a bevy of visiting spacepersons (including at least one female) and of being able to capture on film and audio tape their various craft, why does contactee Billy Meier (and his publisher) provide us with no photos of the aliens themselves? Yes, there is offered to us specimens of metal and crystal for tangible evidence of his claims; yes, there is offered to us pictorial physical-trace landing evidence; yes, there is presented in these 70, ll l / 2 - by 12-inch pages a computerized analysis of selected saucer photos; and yes, in the tradition of von Daniken et al., there is some intriguing, illustrated allusion to extraterrestrialism in antiquity. But all that marshaling of two-dimensional data, no matter how artistically presented and promoted, will neither still the voice of the superskeptic nor produce anything more than moderate acceptance on the part of the pro-ETI UFOlogist. What it will do is to further polarize these two factions of contemporary UFOlogy while at the same time appeal to the less critical 16 instincts of those persons who, for religious or emotional reasons, need to believe in the reality of visiting, benevolent humanoids. What we need, of course, is for Mr. Meier and the chief investigator in this case, retired USAF Lt. Col. Wendelle C. Stevens (a frequent contributor to the UFO press), to forget the flamboyant packaging and the happy huckstering for a moment and to concentrate their public-relations effort on any \"hard evidence\" in their possession. From the photogenic looks of Volume I, and from its off-the-top-of- the-head prose, the initial impression is that this material is too good to be true, that this account, unlike the Adamski contactee prototype of the fifties, will survive both the test of scientific inquiry and the test of time. Fool's Gold of the Gods? Volume I ends on the promise of more to come, to appear in Vol. II with \"startling details\" thus far unsuspected by an intellectually somnolent public. Until that publication, Volume I will rest in one of two places in my home: either on the shelf of my collection of \"fringe element\" UFO literature or on my living-room coffee table, where it will be a visible reminder of how American capitalism can reduce any social phenomenon to the common denominator of bucks at the bookstore and bucks at the box office.-Larry W. Bryant A Visual Survey of UFOlogy Sooner or later, it had to happen, some enterprising observer of the UFO scene had to stumble upon the obvious: the need for, and market for, a handsome comprehensive volume of UFOgraphy. In this case the stumbler is one David C. Knight, whose credentials for compiling this assemblage of black- and-white UFO photographs and drawings (with accompanying text/captions) include his authorship of a commendable children's book on UFO's. And in this case the product itself UFO's: A Pictorial History from Antiquity to the Present (New York: McGraw-Hill Book Co.; 192 pp with bibliography, glossary, subject index, and listing of illustration credits; price: $12.95) - offers the seasoned UFOlogist and the dilettante alike a graphic touchstone for his/her own participation in, and appraisal of, pictorial UFOlogy. The book's quality paper stock, typography, and overall design bring to mind the spate of high-priced science- fiction picture books that compete with one another for the attention of collectors. The only other UFOgraphy book that meets its pictorial challenge was published in 1976 by Japanese UFOlogist Jun-Ichi Takanashi. Half the page size (and half the price) of Knight's volume, Takanashi's nevertheless includes several full-color UFOgraphs. But, of course Takanashi's text is in Japanese, and the English-language content of Knight's includes summaries of key past and present personalities involved in UFOgraphy generation/ investigation. One of the investigators, incidentally, is erroneously referred to, in full-page treatment, as \"the late\" Donald E. Keyhoe, founding director of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena. Major Keyhoe, at the age of 77, is alive and fairly well at his retirement home in Luray, Virgina. For aficionados of \"ancient astronauts,\" pre-turn-of-the-century airships, and post-WW n \"ghost rockets,\" Knight tosses in a selection of the classic artifacts, drawings, and newspaper-clip facsimiles. The author's diligence in compiling this study is reflected in this excerpt from the Foreword: While many excellent books about the UFO phenomenon have been written, none has attempted what this volume does: to present the whole sweep of UFO history in picture and caption. Readers are urged to read it in sequence. Those who merely riffle through these pages in search of sensational shots of UFO's will miss the complete and fascinating UFO story as it has developed over the years. Indeed, many of the \"UFO's\" pictured herein are fakes, misidentifications, or the results of accidental, poor, or defective photography. Therefore, readers are advised to take the time to read this volume from start to finish, in order to leam about the events, circumstances, and personalities involved, and to gain an understanding of the social and political elements as they have unfolded on the UFO scene. The book is arranged chronologically year by year and, as nearly as possible, month by month.

The effects are very like those observed in the western sky from the Los Angeles area after every sunset launch at Vandenberg AFB, about 150 miles to the WNW. It should be recalled the \"Spanish investigation\" of the Canary Islands sky phenomena placed it about 200 miles to the west of the Canary Island group. It could well have been submarine launches of Polaris (United States) or Russian intercontinental missiles. Such test firings would not - readily ; be admitted by the governments involved. That a second firing occurred is also likely. The \"mysterious prediction\" that a UFO would appear after the first effect was fortuitous. The so-called cylindrical object and sky glow in the second picture is almost an exact duplication of what I and many others saw from the Los Angeles South Bay area a number of years ago as a satellite rocket admittedly launched from Vandenberg AFB climbed toward orbit in the dusky western sky just after sunset. It was spectacular. The bright spark of light (the hot, burning exhaust of the rocket itself) climbed steadily for several minutes, even changing course slightly at one point. The : exhaust spread out in a .great glow in the high stratosphere, turning from white to bluish as it slowly faded over a period of an hour in the sky. Meanwhile, below the glow, the ascending rocket exhaust became swirled and assumed many colors as high altitude winds pushed it in all directions. The so-called \"cylindrical object\" is likely the exhaust plume, directly behind the rocket before it spreads out and fades, and is many miles long. It is not an \"object\" and the rocket itself is not visible at that great distance. The colors are produced by electro- chemical reactions between the rarified atmospheric gases and the different molecules in the rocket exhaust. The light conditions just after the sun sets over the ocean helps make them visible. The suggested connection between this \"sighting\" and a National Enquirer article about a pilot who reported a UFO coming by as his plane climbed out of Grand Canary Island is not justified by the dates. The Enquirer article does not give the date of the pilot's probable UFO sighting, and just because it occurred in the same area and year is not reason to connect them. Rocket launch phenomena at dusk or at night can be truly astounding when they take one by surprise. As UFO investigators, we should acquaint ourselves with these colorful atmospheric effects.-Will Nelson, Villa Park, Calif. (Book Review, Continued) cross-referenced by page numbers in parentheses where aspects or personalities of one case apply to another. As a UFO-book collector of 23 years' standing, I welcome Mr. Knight's offering. And for three reasons I encourage him to begin work on a sequel:. (1) To present any newly acquired photographic evidence of UFO reality. (2) To bring us up-to-date on any data uncovered about the background/ technical evaluation of the existing photos. For example, does he or the average UFOlogist know that back in 1976 Grant Jaroslaw of Mt. Clemens, Mich., admitted in a telephone call to a UFO-book writer that his series of widely publicized photographs (January 9, 1967) was hoaxed? (Knight devotes two pages to the Jaroslaw brothers' case.) Also, why not provide an in-depth examination of the recently developed technique for computerized analysis of alleged UFOgraphs? (3) To explore the controversy surrounding the UFOgraphy of Ralph Mayher, whose CIA-confiscated film became the impetus for the continuing Freedom of Information lawsuit of Ground Saucer Watch, Inc., Vs.

Buenos Aires, July 26 (EFE).--Members of the provincial police force fired machine-gun shots against the three crewmen of a flying saucer which landed early this morning in the neighborhood of an airport, according to a report in today's edition of the newspaper El Popular of the city of Olavarria. It was a little after 2 A.M. (0600 GMT) and a wide sector crossing the Tapalque valley was lighted up by a very bright luminosity accompanied by a strange rumbido, more intense each time. A chief of police-whose name is withheld-who at that time was just proceeding to relieve a fellow officer on duty, noted with amazement the strange phenomenon. Hastily, and with four other witnesses, he reconnoitred the place. Armed with machine guns and in an open jeep, they went to the site of the happening. Once there, they ascertained with surprise, a few meters above them, the maneuvers of an oval- shaped object, flat and with some short feet on the edges, which was emitting multicolored rays toward them. At once, with intelligent movements and at giddy speed, it turned up vertically and then landed near some bushes behind the landing runway used by the military on emergency occasions. The powerful light appeared to diminish, and at the side of the flying disc, now more silent, there were three strange beings who measured more than 2 meters in height and were wearing silvery uniforms. -These, with slow steps, giving the impression of being unstable on their feet, made gestures of advancing toward the military garrison. The chief of police, surprised and fearful, tried to stop the OVNI crewmen, firing on them a burst of machine-gun fire, unfortunately without hitting the target. Then, while the unknown personages lifted their hands at the same moment, showing a small luminous ball, all the witnesses felt themselves invaded by a sensation of listlessness and causancio (not in dictionary), which rendered them incapable of using their weapons. Finally, the newspaper adds, the occupants of the ship went back up to it, and went away at great speed on a zigzag course, and the witnesses then recovered their faculties. Immediately, the police squad returned to Olavarria, where they reported this unusual happening.

By Richard Hall A luminous object in the sky — some say two objects — was shown on camera during the CBS-TV broadcast of the Dallas Cowboys and Pittsburgh Steelers football game October 28, 1979. The National Football League (NFL) game was in progress at Three Rivers Stadium, Pittsburgh, Pa., and I was among the TV viewers. Broadcaster Pat Summerall said words to the effect, \"what was that object....maybe we'll get another look at it.\" Shortly afterwards, the camera focused on a shimmering object, which must then have been seen by a few million Americans in addition to some of the tens of thousands in the stands. There was some additional serious commentary about the strangeness of the object, but no description given and no reference points to judge the apparent height or size. Nor was anything said later as to what became of the object. Several people in North Carolina also reported the incident to Wayne LaPorte, who in turn notified several UFO groups. Such a well-witnessed event ought to result in an identification — or a very unusual UFO sighting. Presumably videotape footage is in the possession of CBS, and it could be analyzed if it does show a UFO.

After filming all day and evening, they had interviewed not only the legitimate speakers, and participants, but a fringe element in the lobby of the hotel that did not attend any of the sessions. On Wednesday, November 7th, their edited version was viewed by a nationwide TV audience. Even though major emphasis was given to the personal accounts of some of the abductees and people with close encounters, it was done in good taste, with Paul Cerny moderating this particular workshop. It was a balanced presentation, giving good exposure to Stanton Friedman, Bill Spaulding, Tom Gates, and a crowd overview that confirmed our large attendance. On December 5, 1979, \"Real People\" again featured the work being done by Bill Spaulding, MUFON State Director for Arizona, and GSW's Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit versus the C.I.A. The majority of the short segment concentrated upon the computer photographic enhancement of authentic UFO photos. As MUFON took its earned place as a worldwide UFO organization, it was apparent that one person as the International Coordinator together with the headquarters office could not adequately handle the vast correspondence with our National Directors and Representatives in each nation. About 2 years ago,'the first of eight Continental Coordinators was appointed to provide service to the people in their segment of our planet. It is with jubilation that we announce that Peter Tomikawa has volunteered to become the Continental Coordinator for the Far East, which includes Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Philippines, Pacific Ocean Islands, Malaysia, Sumatra, Borneo, and Singapore. Peter, a Japanese citizen, is employed by Nippon Zeon of America, Inc., in their international management develop- ment program in New York, N.Y. Peter resides at 88 Shoreview Drive #2, Yonkers, NY 10710, with his lovely wife Mako and son Joe. He will continue to serve as MUFON's Continental Coordinator when his employment assignment necessitates his returning to Japan. Peter has been an Ambassador to the United States, representing all of the major UFO organizations in Japan. He has been writing extensively for the Japanese magazine \"UFOs and Space\" depicting the UFO scene in the U.S.A. His vital enthusiasm, congenial diplomatic manners, and experience as an international manager makes his selection an ideal arrangement for this important post. To compliment the fine work being done by our present Continental Coordinators, Keith Basterfield, Jerold Johnson, William Hinrichsen, and Peter Tomikawa, we are delighted to announce the appointment of Mrs. Barbara C. Mathey as our new Continental Coordinator for Africa, including Madagascar. Barbara and her husband Norbert, reside at 1450 North Kenter Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90049. She and her husband have traveled extensively throughout the world, having lived in France for 10 years. She is not only a competent French translator, but can also translate Portuguese to English. Barbara has been attending MUFON symposiums since 1975. Having personally met many of the world's UFO personalities in her travels, we feel that Mrs. Mathey will be a tremendous asset in providing communications with our representa- tives in Africa. Mrs. Cynthia Hind, Representative for Rhodesia, was instrumental in proposing the Continental Coordinator structure for MUFON. Robert Neville, State Director for Nevada, takes pleasure in announcing the appointment of Ron L. Curtis as the new State Section Director for Clark County. Since Ron has recently moved within the city of Las Vegas, his new address and telephone number will be listed in the February 1980 issue of the Journal. He is being ably assisted by Gene Applegarth, a Field Investigator with a B.S. in Engineering, who may be contacted at 6201 Carl Ave., Las Vegas, NV 89108; home telephone (702) 648-7687 or business (702) 732- 3543.
