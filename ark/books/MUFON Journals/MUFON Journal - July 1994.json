GREEN FIREBALLS Dr. LaPaz was definitely looking for something at Roswell. Was it a flying saucer or a green fireball? by Robert Todd F eatured prominently in most books about the Roswell incident are claims made by the late Lewis S. \"Bill\" Rickett, a Special Agent with the Army Air Forces (AAF) Counter-intelligence Corps (CIC). At the time of the incident, he was assigned to the CIC detachment at Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF). Later, when the AAF CIC was absorbed into the newly created Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), Rickett was transferred to AFOSI, but appar- ently remained at RAAF, which by then had been re- named Walker AFB. The AFOSI detachment at Walker AFB was attached to the 17th District OSI headquar- tered at Kirtland AFB, NM. Based on the crashed-saucer proponents' presenta- tions of Rickett's claims, it seems reasonable and fair to observe that Rickett's major contribution to the Roswell story centers around the alleged involvement of Dr. Lincoln LaPaz, Director of the University of New Mexico's Institute of Meteorites, in the Roswell incident. In essence, Rickett claimed that Dr. LaPaz scoured the area surrounding the \"crash\" site for witnesses who saw the object while airborne. From UFO Crash at Roswell (Schmitt and Randle, 1991, page 119): \"Rickett wasn't sure where the idea had come from but LaPaz had the various permissions and clearances to search the area. The CIC Headquarters ordered them to send someone and the senior man volunteered Rickett. He was told to pack his clothes and to take as long as was necessary. If he needed money, he was told to call. He was ordered to take care of LaPaz by driving him to the ranches, finding accommodations, and paying for the trip. \"According to Rickett, he drew a staff car and they drove off, looking for the ranchers and the ranch hands who might have information to share. LaPaz had a topo- graphical map and they used it to mark their progress, sometimes backtracking, talking to the old ranchers and cowboys who had never heard of flying saucers or flying discs and who rarely got into a town of more than two or three hundred people.\" The activities Rickett attributed to LaPaz in connec- tion with the Roswell incident seemed glaringly familiar to me. They mirror exactly the method LaPaz used in his failed attempts to locate fragments of the so-called \"green fireballs\" observed in New Mexico starting in December of 1948, less than two years after the Roswell incident occurred. Because the actions Rickett attributed to LaPaz in connection with the Roswell incident seemed suspi- ciously like those LaPaz took in connection with his green fireball investigations (circa 1948-1951), and be- cause 17th District OSI was deeply involved in the green fireball inquiry (LaPaz reported to the Air Force through the 17th District), I purchased several rolls of Project Blue Book microfilm in what I thought would turn out to be a futile attempt to uncover a green fireball link between Rickett and LaPaz. In addition, the scenario depicted by the crashed-saucer proponents simply didn't make a lot of sense, since the most accurate way to de- termine the speed and trajectory of a crashed object—no matter where or how many times it \"crashed\"—would be through an examination of the crash site(s). It would have been ridiculously unnecessary to interview farmers, ranchers, and ranch hands, unless an attempt was being made to locate possible impact points, as was done in the green fireball investigations. With the Roswell incident, the impact point(s) was/were already known. T he Project Blue Book microfilm (Roll #88) con- tains many records dealing with the green fireball investigation, even though the green fireball inquiry was handled separately from the Blue Book inquiry, and had its own code name (Project \"Twinkle\"). Among the records is a copy of Dr. LaPaz's fourth report to 17th District OSI, dated February 21, 1949. In his letter, Dr. LaPaz says: \"At Roswell, where very effective cooperation was provided by the OSI group at Walker Air Force Base un- der Lt. Paul Ryan, and the local CAP unit under Lt. H. K. Cobean, Special Agent Bill Rickett was added to the survey party and gave much aid in the later work.\" Further examination of the Blue Book microfilm turned up a \"Report of Investigation,\" dated 11 February 1949. The report concerns the investigation of a green fireball incident that occurred on 30 January 1949 in the vicinity of Walker AFB. Page 2 of the report says it \"is a joint report of Special Agents JACK B. WILLIAMS, LEWIS S. RICKETT, and the writer [Lt. Ryan].\" The re- port says (page 1) that \"an almost house-to-house search was conducted East of Roswell by OSI and Dr. LIN- COLN LA PAZ of the University of New Mexico for all possible witnesses.\" The report (page 2) refers to an aerial and ground search conducted in the vicinity of Lamesa, Texas, for physical evidence, with negative JULY 1994 NUMBER3I5 PAGE 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL results. Perhaps most interesting of all, the report says (page 3) that: \"Special Agent RICKETT continued this search throughout Southeast New Mexico and West Texas from 1400 hours, 2 February 1949, to 2400 hours, 5 February 1949. in the company of Dr. LINCOLN LA PAZ of the University of New Mexico. All information obtained during this part of the investigation was retained by Dr. LA PAZ and will be incorporated into his report to OSI.\" Compare the above quote to the following from page 121 of UFO Crash at Roswell: \"Rickett wrote an informal report about what he and LaPaz had seen and done. LaPaz, on the other hand, was required to submit an official report. Everything went to Kirtland and then to Washington.\" G enerally speaking, the 11 February 1949 \"Report of Investigation\" furnishes a detailed accounting of an exhaustive green fireball investigation in which both Special Agent Rickett and Dr. LaPaz participated. Moreover, the activities attributed to Dr. LaPaz in the re- port bear an uncanny resemblance to the activities at- tributed to LaPaz by Rickett in connection with the Roswell incident. Since the report deals with a green fireball incident that occurred in the vicinity of Walker AFB (formerly Roswell Army Air Field), somebody should have asked Rickett which Roswell incident he was talking about. Clearly, more than four decades after these events oc- curred, Rickett, like other Roswell witnesses was con- fused, and mistook the green fireball investigation for the Roswell investigation. This conclusion is supported by the obvious fact that, of the hundreds of alleged Roswell witnesses interviewed by the crashed-saucer proponents, the only one to link Dr. LaPaz to the Roswell incident was Lewis S. \"Bill\" Rickett. Or has an- other witness come forward to confirm Rickett's ques- tionable recollections? The December 1993 edition of the Fund for UFO Research's (FUFOR) The Roswell Events, prepared by Fred Whiting and apparently intended as a \"revised and updated\" version of the Fund's \"Congressional Briefing,\" reveals details of another former AFOSI spe- cial agent who allegedly confirmed Dr. LaPaz's in- volvement in the Roswell incident. From page 28: \"A former Air Force Office of Special Investigations agent. Earl L. Zimmerman, recently disclosed that, in 1949, LaPaz told him of his involvement in the Roswell case. 'He did not discuss the case in any detail,\" says Zimmerman, 'but he did say he went out with two agents and interviewed sheepherders, ranchers, and oth- ers. They told these witnesses they were investigating an \"At about this time, 1 saw Eighth Air Force commander General Roger Ramey in the of- ficer's club more than once. On a couple of occasions, he had Charles Lindbergh with him and 1 heard they were on the base be- cause of the flying saucer business.\" aircraft accident. I seem to recall LaPaz also saying they found an area where the surface of the earth had been turned a light blue and wondering if lightening (sic) could cause such an effect.' \"Zimmerman had been stationed at RAAF in 1947. where he served as a bartender in the base officers' club. \"During the summer of 1947,1 heard many rumors about flying saucers in the club and around the base, in- cluding something about investigating the discovery of one under the guise of a plane crash investigation,' he says. 'At about this time. I saw Eighth Air Force com- mander General Roger Ramey in the O club more than once. On a couple of occasions, he had Charles Lindbergh with him, and I heard they were on the base because of the flying saucer business.'\" Fortunately, Mr. Whiting helps put Zimmerman's testimony into perspective on page 54 by saying: \"Earl L. Zimmerman was stationed at RAAF in July 1947 and was transferred to the Office of Special Investigations at Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque. There, he worked with Dr. Lincoln LaPaz of the University of New Mexico on an extended re- search project. Dr. LaPaz told Zimmerman that 'he had been involved in the investigation of the thing found in the Roswell area,' and that he and his team told wit- nesses they were investigating an aircraft accident. LaPaz also described an area where the surface of the earth had been turned a light blue.\" Mr. Zimmerman's signed affidavit accompanies the Fund's briefing and furnishes additional information to help place Zimmerman's testimony into proper con- text: \"In early 1949, after being transferred to OSI in Albuquerque. I worked with Dr. Lincoln LaPaz of the University of New Mexico on an extended project at the university's research station on top of Sandia Peak. We were told the Air Force was concerned about 'some- thing' being in the night sky over Los Alamos, and we took 15-minute exposures of the sky with a four by five Speed Graphic camera. We worked in three-man, one-week shifts, and Dr. LaPaz was in charge. \"During this project, which lasted for several months, I got to know Dr. LaPaz very well. When I mentioned to him I had been stationed in Roswell during 1947, he told PAGE 4 NUMBER 315 JULY 1994"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL me he had been involved in the investigation of the thing found in the Roswell area that summer. He did not discuss the case in any detail, but he did say he went out with two agents and interviewed sheepherders, ranchers, and others. They told these witnesses they were inves- tigating an aircraft accident. I seem to recall LaPaz also saying they found an area where the surface of the earth had been turned a light blue and wondering if lightening [sic] could cause such an effect.\" O n the surface, Zimmerman's statements would seem to be confirmation of LaPaz's involvement in the Roswell incident. As in the case of Rickett's statements, however, Zimmerman's statements suggest that his in- volvement with Dr. LaPaz centered around the green fireball investigation. So I went back and examined the Blue Book records to see if they could shed any more light on Zimmerman's statements. One Blue Book document, a letter dated 17 May 1949, from the commanding officer of 17th District OSI to higher headquarters, reports that District 17 had \"established a temporary visual and photographic ob- servation post, located northeast of Albuquerque, New Mexico, on the crest of the Sandia Mountains. At present this post is equipped with one (1) wide angle lens cam- era, 8 x 10 film, fitted with a spectographic [sic] grating, and manned twenty-four hours daily by 17th District personnel.\" According to the document: \"This post was set up in view of suggestions made by Dr. Joseph Kaplan, UCLA, and a member of the scien- tific advisory board, USAF, during his recent visit to this district headquarters. Dr. Kaplan suggested that if pos- sible, it would be advisable to establish such a photo- graphic installation.\" Further review of the Blue Book records revealed another document which says that Dr. Kaplan visited 17th District headquarters on 27 and 28 April 1949, at which time apparently Dr. Kaplan and Dr. LaPaz made the recommendation for the establishment of the pho- tographic observation post. This was undoubtedly the observation post to which Mr. Zimmerman had been as- signed, and it was established because of the green fire- ball investigation. So we have Mr. Zimmerman being assigned to Dr. LaPaz's observation post sometime between 27 April, the date of Dr. Kaplan's visit, and 12 May, the date the District 17 commander reported the establishment of the observation post to higher headquarters. Dr. LaPaz and Mr. Zimmerman are at the observation post for an extended period of time, looking for green fireballs and other aerial phenomena. During this period, Zimmerman reveals to LaPaz that he had been stationed at Walker AFB, apparently as late as early 1949 when he JULY 1994    NUMBER 315 was transferred to Kirtland AFB and OSI. At this point, LaPaz allegedly reveals to Zimmerman that \"he had been involved in the investigation of the thing found in the Roswell area that summer.\" Ignoring the \"that summer\" part of Zimmerman's statement, we are entitled to ask. Which Roswell incident was LaPaz referring to? Was he referring to the crash of the alien spacecraft on the Foster Ranch in July of 1947? Or was he really referring to the green fireball incident that occurred in the vicinity of Walker AFB just three months previously, which resulted in an exhaustive search throughout Southeast New Mexico and West Texas? Human nature being what it is, the most likely answer is that LaPaz was referring to the more recent in- cident that occurred near Walker AFB, from which Zimmerman had recently been transferred. I addressed my questions to Mr. Zimmerman, and he confirmed that the observation post was set up to pho- tograph green fireballs and other aerial phenomena. In a follow-up letter, I informed Mr. Zimmerman of what I had learned from the Blue Book files about the estab- lishment of the observation post, and told Mr. Zimmerman about Dr. LaPaz's investigation of the green fireball incident that occurred near Walker AFB on 30 January 1949.1 asked Mr. Zimmerman if it was possible that Dr. LaPaz had been speaking of the more recent in- cident (the 30 January 1949 event), rather than the July 1947 event. In response, Mr. Zimmerman stated that he \"cannot truly say which green fireball he [LaPaz] was chasing at any given time,\" which is perfectly under- standable given the number of years that have passed since these events occurred. A s a result, it must be concluded that, if Dr. LaPaz said anything to Mr. Zimmerman about any Roswell incident, most likely he was referring to the more recent event that occurred on 30 January 1949 in the vicinity of Walker AFB, an incident that resulted in an impressive search for physical evidence. This, I believe, is the best interpretation of the cir- cumstances surrounding the alleged involvement of Dr. LaPaz in the \"Roswell incident.\" I further believe that any rational person will agree with this interpretation. It is also interesting to note that, of all the various teams of Roswell investigators (first Moore and Friedman; then Schmitt and Randle; and then Friedman and Berliner), only one team (Friedman and Berliner) even mentions LaPaz's involvement in the green fireball investigations, and they only mention it very briefly in passing. In other words, Dr. LaPaz's involvement in the green fireball investigations is most conspicuous by its absence, and one is forced to wonder why. Were the Roswell in- vestigators simply unaware of the facts related above? Or, if aware of same, did they simply ignore them? As im- portant as what the crashed-saucer proponents put into their published writings is what they leave out. PAGES"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL ABDUCTION RESEARCH IN AUSTRALIA Less populous, Australia doesn 't have as many reports. Those it does have are remarkably similar to ours. by Keith Basterfield A ustralia is an island continent. In size it is some 80% of the area of the United States, but has a population of only 16 million. Its coastal areas are more densely populated, with vast inland areas being isolated desert. Australia is a multi-cultural society with the popu- lation initially of native Aboriginies, then immigrants derived firstly from the United Kingdom, then Europe, and now Asia. It has a Westminster system of democracy, with a central federal government and eight state governments. The mass media regularly carry items about UFOs. However, the subject is rarely taken seriously. Abductions are far from an everyday topic of conver- sation, for example, only one Australian abductee has been featured on a prime time television chat show. Overseas UFO documentaries do appear from time to time with segments on abductions. Although books by Randies, Vallee, Strieber, Hopkins, Fiore, Jacobs and Schnabel have been car- ried by book sellers, only Strieber's \"Communion\" made an impact. Books typically arrive in Australia some 4-6 months after release in the UK or the USA. CATALOGUE Recently, I have completed the compilation of an updated catalogue of Australian abduction cases. The catalogue is intended to provide brief summaries of abduction accounts which have been collected from Australia and New Zealand. It has been produced from a larger catalogue of cases of \"missing time,\" abduction and \"abduction-like\" reports, the fifth edi- tion of which was compiled in December 1993. To select the cases for this catalogue it was neces- sary to arrive at a definition to use for an \"abduction.\" I decided to utilise that described in an article titled: \"Psychosocial Characteristics of Abductees: Results from the CUFOS Abduction Project,\" authored by Mark Rodeghier, Jeff Goodpaster and Sandra Blatterbauer, which appeared in the 1991 Volume 3 of the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies' Journal of UFO Studies. This definition is: 1. \"A witness must be taken against his or her will from normal, terrestrial surroundings by non-human beings. 2. These beings must take the witness to another en- closed space that is not terrestrial in appearance and is assumed or known by the witness to be a spacecraft. 3. In this place, the witness must either be subjected to various procedures 'that appear to be examinations of some type, engage in communication (verbal or telepathic) with the beings, or both. 4. These experiences may be remembered con- sciously or through various means of focused concen- tration, such as hypnosis, or by a combination of the two.\" I n comparison to the United States, little coverage of the subject continues to appear in the media in Australia. Items carried on television are mainly in the nature of imported specials on UFOs which feature, in part, abductions. However, the mini-series \"Intruders\" did feature as a two-part series in mid-1992. Interestingly, no new cases came to light as a result of the showing. Secondly, a UFORA search for Australian abductees was conducted in late 1992, which received wide media exposure, and resulted in a number of additional new cases being received, details of which have been incorporated into this updated cat- alogue. Thirdly, last year, late night chat shows fea- tured interviews with Travis Walton who was here in Australia to promote the film \"Fire in the Sky.\" There continues to be no broad appreciation of the abduction phenomenon amongst health professionals in Australia. Consequently, only about half a dozen in the whole country, to my knowledge, have taken an interest. UFO Research Queensland is working with an industrial psychologist, and recently initiated an abductee support group. Bill Chalker and Robb Tilley in Sydney have teamed up with several psychologists. An abductee support group also exists in Sydney. In Adelaide, the author and Peter Jones have enlisted the assistance of a psychologist, and a psychotherapist. Two case studies, have been published. One on abductee \"Susan\" in IUR 16(2): 4-6 & 22, and one on the Puddy abduction appearing in the IUR 17(3): 13- 14 & 23. It is planned to slowly document and publish others as time permits. Many of these accounts reveal complex narratives involving multiple episodes of \"abduction,\" \"missing time\" and/or psychic/paranor- mal events. The latter aspect has been very often over- looked in the work of American abduction researchers. ANALYSIS: The compilation of \"missing time,\" \"abduction-like\" and abduction cases, netted a total of 83 reported events from Australia and New Zealand. PAGE 6 NUMBER 315 JULY 1994"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL An example of an Australian \"missing time\" event is as follows: In September or October 1970, in Sydney, New South Wales, one night a man noticed a red/orange glow in the bushland close to his home. He took his dog and went to investigate. Getting closer to it, he saw a glow illumi- nating the area. His dog became excited and dashed into the bush. There next appears to be a discontinuity in his physical and emotional reactions—an apparent pe- riod of \"missing time.\" He next recalled seeing an owl fly past him and he could hear his own internal thoughts: \"There's something I should remember.\" Strangely, although previously very curious about the glow, he then lost interest and went home. An example of an Australian \"abduction-like\" ex- perience is one investigated by my colleague Bill Chalker of Sydney: It happened in 1976 in rural New South Wales. A 31- year-old woman was vacuuming about noon one day when she felt ill. Suddenly three little beings just ap- peared in front of her. One being was some 5 feet tall, very slender with a very elongated face. The other two were much shorter, with chubby, broader faces. All three had large eyes, with a hint of a nose and a mouth. Each wore shroud-like cloaks. Telepathically the taller being spoke to her, to tell her she had to go with them. The woman refused. The next thing she can recall is of her fiance arriving home at 5:30 p.m. A hypnotic re- gression revealed little beyond that of the conscious memories. However, utilizing the CUFOS definition for an ab- duction, this number of \"missing time,\" \"abduction- like\" and abduction events is reduced to just 39. The following presents an analysis of the data from the 39 known abduction cases: THE WITNESSES Forty-six individuals were involved in the 39 cases. Of the 33 individuals who participated in single witness events, 10 were male and 23 female. There were six multi-witness reports, of which the following is per- haps the most interesting. The location was Adelaide, South Australia, and I was the prime investigator. It occurred in July of 1989. A man was lying in bed trying to get to sleep when a low-pitched humming noise was heard. His wife, lying alongside him, apparently asleep, said he was not to worry, do as they say. He couldn't work out what she meant, and suddenly found himself paralysed. Next he found himself floating along the hall passageway into the lounge. Entering the lounge he saw his son in the arms of a strange being, some 5 feet 10 inches tall. It was of a greenish-white colour and appeared humanlike. Next he recalls lying down in a dark room. In this room was a non-human being. He described it as having an oval-shaped head; and big black eyes, the shape of eggs. There was no nose, just two holes, and a small slit Telepathically the taller being spoke to her, to tell her she had to go with them. The woman refused. The next thing she can recall is of her fiance arriving home at 5:30 p.m. of a mouth. Then he was floated back and went to sleep in his own bed. Next morning both he and his wife felt very strange. She can recall talking in her sleep, but not the words she used. She says she felt a presence during the night but was not afraid. She has a memory of being on a table with some people looking at her. She felt she had been investigated, then drifted back to her bed. Hypnotic re- gression of both persons confirmed the above details. Where age is given, (28 individuals) only two are over 40 years of age, with one being 63 at the time. In what setting do Australian abductions occur? An analysis shows just over 61% occur in suburban bed- rooms and 36% in rural outside environments. A typical bedroom intrusion was reported from Melbourne in Victoria in 1979 where a man named Mark retired to bed one night at about 11 p.m. Shortly after closing his eyes he lost all sense of sound and feeling and found himself travelling in a tunnel through space. Looking forwards he noted a light at the end of the tunnel. His next awareness was of lying on a table in a \"craft.\" He was medically examined by three beings. One of the beings seemed to be a human female, with long blonde hair. The other two were some 150cm tall, fat, and of a dark brown colour. These latter two had plumpish faces, large eyes, a large nose, bigger lips and ears than us. They addressed him in English, and seemed like scientists. When they introduced a \"scanner\" to check him over, he \"freaked out\" and woke up in his own bed. All his teeth felt numb and his knuckles were white. A representative rural event was that investigated by Mark Moravec of Ballarat in Victoria, occurring in September 1979 at Jindabyne, New South Wales. Two young men, out hunting, reported seeing a bright white, spherical, light on the ground some little dis- tance away. Next night it was seen again. In 1983 one of the men began recalling memories of a two-hour time lapse on one of those nights. He consciously recalled that they were both sur- rounded by a blue light as they went near the object. They were floated through a hatch into a grey-coloured, rectangular room in the UFO. After being put on two \"benches\" they were examined by several tall beings. The beings were hairless, grey, and had grey bulges where we have eyes. Slit-like mouths and flat noses, with no ears were described. During the examination, and without tearing their clothes, the beings connected \"wires\" to the men. JULY 1994 NUMBER 315 PAGE?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL The reporting man felt \"used,\" as if a specimen. They were then returned to the original spot where they had been. What of the entities reported? Unfortunately, perhaps due to fragmentary recall, data is complete in only 17 cases concerning the physi- cal description of the entities. There is an almost 1 to 2 ratio of reported humanoids and non-humanoids. Heights are spread from below 90cm to 240cm. Large heads are reported in eight cases, there are nine reports of alien eyes being large. Eye color is predominantly black. HYPNOSIS Almost all Australian abductees have fragmentary con- scious recall of some, if not all of their encounter. Regression was used in 15 cases. Only in three in- stances was there no conscious recall of an abduction; and once a girl in a hypnotic state spontaneously \"jumped into\" a \"flying saucer.\" Amazingly, this last case occurred in 1955 and was documented at that time. What of communication? In 15 cases comment is made about communication by the entity(ies) to the abductee, with nine mentions of telepathic means for this communication. Family connections? Besides the July 1989 episode mentioned earlier, in- volving husband and wife together, only one other case clearly records an attempt at involving more than one member of the family: In April 1991 a married, Melbourne woman related to me a series of events extending back some 14 months from that time. These included her 6-year-old son re- porting that 5-6 little men entered his bedroom and shone a \"torch\" at him. He felt paralysed and whilst there the men telepathically told him they would not hurt him, but examined him and pushed something up his nose. He described them as having gray skin, big heads and big black eyes. The woman recalled an episode where something tried to physically pull her out of bed during the night. She also recalled an episode at age 7. which she thought was a dream, where three pixies entered her room and abducted her. In 1991 she was regressed and this revealed: 1. At age 7, six beings entered her bedroom and took her away to a room somewhere. After examining her they pushed something up her nose. She was told she had been chosen for some task, not revealed to her yet. She did not feel they were going to hurt her. She was floated back home and into her bed. She woke up and thought it had been a dream. 2. At age 36, in 1991, beings again came to her bed- room and tried to take her away but she refused to go. Shortly after this, and while she was in bed with her hus- band, three small beings returned. They scraped both her and her husband with a silver \"knife\" telling her this was the last time for a while. At some stage the beings told her she is to spread knowledge when they are ready. They also told her the device up her nose was to keep track of her.

But getting MUFON members and other serious urologists to go on televi- sion and joke about aliens in front of millions of peo- ple never is easy. The Tonight Show staff had seen publicity on a UFO event and thought they'd do a funny piece on it according to Patty Grant, the show's producer. \"We wanted to do something light-hearted to run as a seg- ment on our show.\" When Grant contacted organizers of the LIFO Expo West, they asked her not to come to the conference, ac- cording to William McDonald, MUFON member in charge of security for the event. \"They didn't feel re- searchers and abductees would react well to a comedy situation,\" he said. But Grant took Leno and an on-location staff to the conference, anyway. Once there, they were given per- mission from hotel management to do on camera inter- views in the commons area where the two-day confer- ence took place. A crowd gathered instantly and cameras began to roll as individuals came forward to meet Jay Leno and talk with him. \"Do you know an alien?\" he began. His interview was structured in a format that started with a general question and became more specific. If the respondent was funny, the comedian pulled out a tabloid newspaper and sported a photo of Bill Clinton shaking hands with an alien. \"Does the President know any aliens?\" he continued. His coup de grace was another tabloid. Holding up a page with a headline that said. \"Twelve Senators are Aliens,\" he asked, \"Do you think the senators are aliens?\" Some played along amidst constant battering and shouts of, \"Tell the truth. Jay,\" and \"Tell about the cover-up.\" On the defensive. Leno tried to act sympathetic. \"I'm sorry.\" he said several times. \"I'm just trying to have fun with this.\" MUFON members Budd Hopkins and Yvonne Smith were amongst those pulled from meetings to talk to Leno. \"I told the producer what I do and about my CERO (Close Encounter Research Organization) and abductee support groups.\" Smith said. \"Patty Grant looked at me and said that my stuff, as Grant called it. was way too se- rious.\" JULY 1994 NUMBER 315 PAGE 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Smith said that the producer was very nice and they politely ended their conversation. The encounter between Hopkins and Leno was even shorter. They met and each went on their way. Spending over an hour at the conference convinced that there was some funny material there, Leno met and interviewed around 30 people. One of his subjects was Vicki Cooper, publisher of UFO Magazine. \"I wish I hadn't talked to him,\" she said. \"He started firing these questions at me and I'm re- ally not sure how it's going to turn out.\" One individual who did joke with the comedian on camera said, \"Oh, I've used the line a couple times that I was out late, honey, because the aliens abducted me.\" As Leno and his crew packed up their gear and left, a lecture in the meeting room next door was on: \"How to determine what may or may not be real in the often confusing field of Ufology.\" — Debbie Stock ROSWELL ON SHOWTIME by Debbie Stock F ilm Producer Paul Davids didn't believe in UFO's when he first attempted producing a Roswell movie back in 1983. But that was before he had a daylight disc sighting in his yard with his daughters four years ago in Los Angeles. \"From that point on, I began reading everything I could about the subject,\" he said. \"I had worked in sci- ence fiction for years but I never thought that it would become a reality for me until I had that sighting.\" Davids is looking forward to seeing his research be- come reality in his role as Executive Producer of Viacom's motion picture, \"Roswell,\" which should be released for airing July 31st on Showtime. Speaking to a standing room only crowd at a recent UFO conference in Los Angeles, he told the audience why he felt the Roswell case of 1947 was the most sig- nificant in ufology. \"We have for the first and only time, the US Army going on record that they found something crashed in the desert of New Mexico and they couldn't identify it,\" he said. Helping recreate that famed event wasn't easy, ac- cording to Davids. \"In 1983 we had a commitment from HBO to make a movie based on Roswell,\" he said. \"But it seemed a lot of horses were conspiring against us.\" When HBO withdrew its offer, the project was can- celled. \"It was a very black time,\" he said. It took six years to jump start the project again, ac- cording to the entrepreneur, who also has written a series of science fiction books for children. Paul Davids/Photo b\\> Debbie Stock With a budget of $6 million and Showtime's com- mitment, Davids put together a film based on Randle and Schmitt's \"UFO Crash at Roswell,\" starting in 1989. \"We got the rights for their book and I was one of three with a story credit,\" he said. He described how the story was put together, using a \"Rashamon\" structure of flashbacks. The actors are in the present and then they're flashed back to a scene, re- called in someone's memory. \"It wasn't a jigsaw puzzle where every piece fits, because we had many witnesses and some are now de- ceased,\" he said. \"Over 350 people testified about Roswell so we had to find the broad strokes of the case.\" That was a challenge for Davids but one of the best things for him was dealing with a scene in an examining room. \"The beings weren't necessarily grays, but were more human,\" he said. \"The bottom line is that whoever was the custodian of those biological remains, we had to use our judgement.\" Audioanimatronics were used to create the special ef- fects of one being, still alive on the examining table. \"Steve Johnson of FSX did an excellent job making it work,\" he said. \"There were wires running to it and PAGE 10 NUMBER 315 JULY 1994"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL seven people remotely operating the wires to make it move.\" While it wasn't all fun and games, Davids said that he was glad to see the project to completion. \"Maybe the time was finally right for us to do this.\" Now he is waiting. \"With evidence pointing to President Truman ordering a cover-up back in 1947, I'm hoping we'll see some sort of public recognition when the movie is aired.\" For those who don't receive Showtime, Davids said that depending on different variables, it's possible the film could be released on video at a later date.

SCIENCE MUSEUM SYMPOSIUM TO EXAMINE UFO EVIDENCE While many people believe the essential features of our universe are well understood, a group of scientists and researchers coming to the Science Museum of Minnesota this fall says the scientific world is in for a dramatic revolution in thinking about mankind's place in the cosmos. In a symposium titled, \"The Science and Politics of UFO Research,\" professional scientists from around the country will meet in St. Paul the weekend of November 5 & 6 to discuss the progress of their re- search into the global UFO phenomenon and explore the implications of their discoveries for humanity. The event also will compare the UFO controversy with major sci- entific revolutions of the past. \"There are two major aspects to the UFO contro- versy,\" explained symposium coordinator and journalist Terry Hansen. \"One is what it tells us about the way sci- entific progress occurs and the other is what the contro- versy tells us about the role government plays in con- trolling or restricting research. The UFO controversy has a great deal to teach us about the politics of science.\" Hansen studied the UFO controversy as part of his grad- uate program in science journalism at the University of Minnesota and has produced a documentary on the subject broadcast on National Public Radio. \"In this era of Big Science, people often feel that scientific research is only legitimate if it is supported by the federal government,\" Hansen said. \"But scientific le- gitimacy is a philosophical, not political, issue. Contrary to what some people may think, opinion surveys show UFO research enjoys broad support among rank-and-file scientists and engineers, and increasing numbers are actually doing it.\" Scheduled speakers for the two-day event include Dr. Richard Haines, a physiological psychologist for- merly with NASA's Ames Research Center; Jack Kasher, professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Nebraska at Omaha; nuclear physicist, author and nationally known UFO lecturer Stanton Friedman; Dr. Ron Westrum, a sociologist with the Department of Interdisciplinary Technology at Eastern Michigan University; engineering physicist and author James McCampbell; Dr. Thomas Bullard, folklore scholar at Indiana University; and Kevin Randle, former military pilot, Air Force intelligence officer, and co- author (with Donald R. Schmitt) of two books about the Roswell UFO crash-recovery. Additional speakers are expected. One of the symposium's goals is to explore the work- ings of science in modern society. Unexpected scientific discoveries are nearly always highly controversial and the Science Museum plans to use the debate about UFOs as a \"case study\" of science in action. \"While it's human nature to reject information that does not support our be- liefs and theories about the universe, the history of sci- ence tells us that this is a mistake,\" Hansen explained. \"All of the major theories of modern science—conti- nental drift, quantum physics, biological evolution, and relativity—were based upon observations that initially did not make sense in the context of established theory. In addition, the conclusions suggested by these obser- vations were often so controversial that they were not fully accepted by the scientific mainstream for decades after they were first proposed. Thus, the study of UFO reports is not only scientifically valid, it may well be es- sential to understanding the universe. \" Registration cost for the two-day symposium is $115.

The 34-year-old mother of two of the three children in the automobile drove right underneath the flat-bottom domed disk, visible at the 10:00 p.m. hour by its five brilliant white lights and one red one shining down from its underside. This object maneuvered very slowly around the road and the witnesses, who stopped for three to five minutes to study it, just north of Charlestown, Rhode Island, \"when out of nowhere came the second object about 1/3 to 1/4 of the size of the first.\" This one had five more of the \"blinding\" lights on it. Both objects started drifting to the northwest, so the car was moved to be able to see them among the trees. A third and fourth light appeared, these just starlike points, and the excitement in the car became too much for the youngest, an eight-year-old girl, who \"became scared and started crying hysteri- cally.\" By the time the others got her calmed again, the lights were almost out of sight, so they continued to their house. Calls to police and airports turned up no other witnesses.

Under a rainy, overcast sky at 7:40 p.m., the witness thought it to be highly unusual and put his binoculars on it, only to see it fade rapidly to darkness. Five minutes later a formation of three twin-engine military planes, blinking white lights, flew low over the same spot and close to the witness's house, followed closely by a heli- copter. A few minutes later, the apparent same three planes, minus the helicopter, flew in from the ocean following the reverse course north over the pond. Was it a military exercise involving a flare? MEMORIAL TO JEROLD R. \"RON\" JOHNSON 1950-1994 The entire MUFON organization is mourning the loss of our Deputy Director, Investigations, Jerold \"Ron\" Johnson, who died suddenly on June 9. 1994, while at- tending the annual meeting of the Society for Scientific Exploration (SSE) in Austin, Texas. Ron was born in Dallas, Texas, on June 16, 1950. He graduated from the University of Texas (Austin) in December 1972 with a degree in Anthropology. On October 28, 1978. he married Rox Ann Albrecht from La Grange, Texas. He is survived by his wife and two sons, Neal. eleven, and Wyatt, two and-a-half years of age, his parents, Mr. and Mrs. James W. Johnson, and a brother. Brian Johnson. Ron was an avid scuba diver and speleologist. He was known on MUFON's amateur radio net as WA5RON. He joined MUFON in June 1973 and held successive positions of Field Investigator, Texas State Amateur Radio Director. Continental Coordinator for Central America, and the Board of Directors, Executive Committee, as Deputy Director, Investigations (Vice President). He was employed by Earth Tech International, Inc., headed by Harold Puthoff, Ph.D., in Austin. Harold \"Hal\" Puthoff and Walter Andrus were pallbearers for the services on June 12, 1994. The family suggested that memorials be made to the Mutual UFO Network or to the charity of your choice. It will be difficult finding someone in MUFON with Ron's qualifications and persistence to details to fill this important position on the Board of Directors.

Heaton W hen I first became acquainted with MUFON, it was apparent to me that this was an organi- zation with a chip on its shoulder. I was amused with the emotional emphasis on scientific re- porting and with the prestigious titles offered to scientists willing to join the cause. Being new to the subject of UFOs. I was curious as to what lay behind the defen- siveness and mistrust that permeated much of the soci- ety's literature. Only after learning some history was I able to solve this puzzle. MUFON was organized to win UFOs back from the \"contactees\" and the tabloids, to promote scientific in- vestigation of a phenomenon that the scholars had re- jected in company with ghosts and bigfoot. Science, as we know it today, is the study of the physical world: it attempts to explain all phenomena on a physical basis, even psychological issues such as religious faith and vi- sions. It is therefore little wonder that the scientific study of UFOs began with a focus on the physical nature of the intruding spacecraft rather than the message of their supposed alien pilots. One need look no further than MUFON's UFO Sighting Questionnaire to recog- nize where the emphasis squarely lay. UFOs have always been a mystery, an elusive phe- nomenon that spurns our expectations and defies cate- gorization. Scientists have long debated the evolution of life elsewhere in the galaxy, but UFOs lack a consistent physical fonn and familiar rationale that would identify them as mere travelers from a distant planet. Christians believe in a dichotomous unseen world of angels and evil spirits, but UFOs and their occupants show no intent of confirming or destroying the Christian faith. New Age enthusiasts are open to almost any outside force in the universe, so it is little wonder that they adopted the supposed aliens as benevolent space brothers here to save us from folly. But as time has passed and more has been learned, this simplistic explanation has also fallen on hard ground. The more we learn, the more enig- matic the UFO phenomenon becomes. What is needed to make a mystery scientific, espe- cially when human testimony is its primary database? One method, exemplified by the work of Ray Fowler, is the rigorous case study. If a witness' report can be cor- |ULY 1994    NUMBER 315 roborated with some outside evidence and can stand up to lie detector tests and extensive psychological eval- uation, then it becomes hard to dismiss out of hand. When multiple witnesses report the same event, an even stronger case is made. A second and much more con- vincing method of investigation, exemplified by Budd Hopkins and Dave Jacobs, is to collect reports from a large and diverse sample of people and show that all are reporting the same esoteric details in their accounts. This is how Raymond Moody made the \"near-death experience\" a science, and it has been equally success- ful with UFOs. It has also drawn MUFON out of its fo- cus on the physical aspects of unidentified flying objects, much to its chagrin. The UFO has now become syn- onymous with the so-called \"abduction phenomenon.\" U fology has long been plagued by a reliance on am- ateur investigators. There was therefore great ex- pectations when John E. Mack, distinguished Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, espoused the cause and began writing his book, Abduction: Human Encounters with Aliens. But after three months in print this book has aroused nothing but controversy in both the UFO and psychiatric communities. The reason: Mack has linked UFO encounters with all the shady New Age phenomena that the skeptics had always lumped it with, from shamanism to reincarnation, and he has done so with little critical analysis or justification. Instead of winning the scientific world over to a belief in alien visitors. Mack has only aroused more skepticism and confusion. Having made this introduction, it may come as a sur- prise that I enjoyed the book and believe it to be a land- mark contribution. Before I explain why this is so, I need to state what the book is not. There are two important questions we would like someone with Mack's qualifi- cations to address: 1) is there any purely psychological explanation for the terrifying abduction accounts? and 2) is hypnosis a reliable method for recalling the details of abduction experiences? Mack does treat these ques- tions, but he does so very superficially, never giving de- tailed analysis to alternative explanations. The book is also not a piece of rigorous detective work like those of Fowler, Hopkins, and Jacobs. Mack presents thirteen case studies and makes comparisons between them, but once again the comparisons are superficial and fail to make a strong scientific case for the reality of alien ab- ductions. Mack's approach is clearly anecdotal rather than analytical. Many readers have had difficulty finding a theme in Abduction and have described it as a directionless mono- logue. The strongest theme concerns human spiritual evolution, a topic that falls on thin soil in both the psy- chiatric and UFO communities. A second theme con- cerns the need for more education about the abduction phenomenon among psychiatric practitioners, though whether this book will encourage such a trend remains to PAGE 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL be seen. But this lack of a strong theme can also be seen as one of the book's strengths. Mack is not trying to espouse any particular conclusion: he lets the abductees tell their whole stories with as little guidance or restric- tion as possible. Instead of driving hard at physical de- tails, he looks for the overarching essence of these strange contacts. In doing so he has found something that many have overlooked: that behind the trauma and fear and humiliation there is something overwhelm- ingly positive and transformative in interacting with entities that are fundamentally different from ourselves. T he idea that UFO encounters are generating spiritual evolution is not new with Mack. Kenneth Ring in his 1992 book The Omega Project came to a similar conclusion while at the same time proposing that UFOs and aliens are not objective realities (an unpopular con- clusion with MUFON in both respects). With his spiri- tual focus, one might ask how Mack differs from the in- famous \"contactees\" of the 1950s. I see two major dis- tinctions. First, Mack is letting his patients, or co-in- vestigators as he calls them, tell their own stories with few cues. Many speak of feeling at \"home\" with the aliens, of having some kind of dual human/alien spiritual identity, of having past incarnations in which they also experienced interaction, and of being shown prophetic visions of the world's destruction. And like the ab- ductees reported by Hopkins and other researchers, most of these people have nothing to gain from their stories and wish to remain anonymous. This alone sets them apart from the publicity-seeking \"contactees\" and makes their accounts credible. But the second difference is much more profound: Mack's patients report their spir- itual growth at the end of an agonizing road in which their entire concept of reality is shattered by the ab- ductions. This not only makes the \"contactees\" look like hopeful simpletons by comparison, but it also ac- knowledges the undeniable strangeness and ambiguity of the abduction phenomenon. An important question to be asked about this book is why Mack took the approach that he did. Unfortunately he makes us read between the lines for an answer, but I believe the answer is there. His previous work with nightmares, adolescent suicides, and transpersonal psy- chology provides a partial answer, but more important is the transformation in his thinking that took place during the course of his abduction study. I found it classic that before embarking he paid a visit to Thomas Kuhn, au- thor of The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. Kuhn has shown that scientific objectivity is largely a myth and that our cultural biases shape our perception of reality in subtle ways. He suggested that Mack circumvent Western dichotomies such as real/unreal and physi- cal/psychological wherever possible. Even with this suggestion Mack's study seems to have started on a stronger scientific foundation than it ended. But he changed his focus after listening to his patients, listening Mack has found something that many have overlooked: that behind the trauma and fear and humiliation there Is something over- whelmingly positive and transformative in interacting with entities that are fundamen- tally different from ourselves. to the underlying message of their encounters rather than only the details that happened to fit his precon- ceived notions. It took someone with Mack's genius to realize that the abduction phenomenon is bound to change our whole epistemology as well as our world view, and therefore a \"scientific\" study did not seem ap- propriate. In the end he saw that to follow his initial course would be to betray his patients and everything their message stood for. This unconstrained approach is the root of Mack's problems with the scientific community, for he is trying to break new ground by not playing by the rules. This may sound silly and unproductive at first glance, but let's face it: all our Western world views, scientific and religious alike, have utterly failed to incorporate the abduction phenomenon in anything but a bastardized form. Ufologists from Hynek to Jacobs have been pos- tulating other \"realities\" or \"dimensions\" that have no place in science as we know it. By stretching the possi- bilities Mack is merely seeking an understanding of what such a modified concept of reality might mean. Mack's book offers several major challenges to the UFO community. MUFON and other groups have come to view UFOs in terms of conspiracies, the aliens being parasites and the abductees being unwitting victims. This dogma has been moderately successful in gaining scientific respectability, pacifying the abductees with an explanation, and avoiding any overlap with the lu- natic New Age fringe. Despite its tenuous status, there is much resistance to relinquishing this dogma for fear of backstepping in all these areas. But I, for one, have never found this explanation satisfactory. It feels like a last-ditch effort to align the phenomenon with something familiar when every evidence suggests that it is not. If alien beings are penetrating our world from a reality we cannot fathom, then any perception of a one-sided rela- tionship may well be an illusion. Mack's patients, when given free reign to follow their intuition, find a strange but instructive balance in this relationship, one that has previously been reported by Betty Luca, Whitley Strieber, and others. To ignore this information is to overlook an important clue. It is reminiscent of the re- luctance to accept abduction accounts just a few years ago. Mack and his co-investigators talk of a personal spir- itual growth that results from alien contact and also from becoming aware of that contact, and in this en- PAGE 14 NUMBER 315 JULY 1994"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL lightenment they report many phenomena familiar to \"Eastern\" and \"New Age\" religions. This is problematic for several reasons. First, it further severs the UFO phe- nomenon from scientific rationalism, and it may be that we can no longer see UFOs in isolation from other psy- chic phenomena. Second, it may cause a division in the UFO community based on individual religious beliefs, for how will a team of people with diverse backgrounds manage to investigate a phenomenon that has enormous religious implications? While these may seem like in- surmountable problems that will hopelessly postpone the resolution of the UFO puzzle, they also suggest that we may have more to learn from this phenomenon than previously recognized. We may all have to give up fun- damental assumptions and pillars of faith in order to get closer to the \"truth\" of our existence, and UFOs may be just the puzzle to guide us in that direction. Perhaps the abduction phenomenon is more instructive and reaches nearer our center of being than we ever imag- ined, and perhaps this is so because of, not in spite of, its incomprehensibility. Mack's book is enormously thought provoking and deserves a more careful look. Let us get over our initial disappointment, lay aside our historic biases, and look at the book for what Mack intended it to be. It is not the last word on anything, but it is a beginning, and an in- triguing one at that. Dr. Heaton Is an associate professor of Earth Sciences at the University of South Dakota, Vermllllon.

Just so you'll know, however, I did co- edit and publish it in company with another student of anomalous phenomena, Patrick Huyghe, whom many of you will also know. The initial idea behind The Anomalist was to provide a new venue wherein writers and researchers could treat \"weird\" subjects of every stripe—including their own first-person experiences—at length in a relaxed, literate style. We also wanted to encourage detailed investiga- tions of anomalous phenomena. And we wanted to pro- vide a somewhat more permanent forum for the publi- cation of this kind of material than that provided by, say, Fortean Times, Strange Magazine or Fate. If the first is- sue succeeds, we intend to publish two volumes a year. As might be expected, the contents (and contributors) are eclectic by choice. The first article, \"Dinosaurs and the Gravity Problem\" by Ted Holden, addresses the issue of why so many dinosaurs were so gigantic when com- pared to today's walking and flying equivalents. Could the answer lie in a dramatic change of something so fun- damental as the Earth's gravitational field? Next, Patrick Huyghe interviews clinical psychologist Mario Pazzaglini, who has been conducting a study of writing samples allegedly acquired from alien entities, either via channeled contact or other means. Several examples are reproduced from Pazzaglini's own self- published book, Symbolic Messages. Martin Cannon's \"The Numbers Game,\" illustrated by Sal Amendola, recounts the author's personal expe- riences with electronic \"loop lines,\" a disembodied voice from Montreal identifying herself only as Joanne, and weird phone calls heard in the night which recite an endless series of seemingly meaningless numbers. In \"The Daytona Beach Mystery Wave\" Patrick Huyghe examines a mysterious wave of water which struck a limited section of the Florida coastline on the night of July 3, 1992, and the many scientific explana- tions that surfaced in its wake. |ULY 1994 NUMBER 31 5 PAGE 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Paul Rydeen's \"Cargo of the Gods?\" examines the history of cargo cults in Papua New Guinea and draws some interesting comparisons and parallels with con- temporary contactees and the UFO movement as a whole. The difference, says Rydeen, is that nowadays we don't yearn so much \"for material cargo, as for knowl- edge or wisdom.\" The longest article in the book, Martin Kottmeyer's \"The First Extraordinary Claim,\" looks at the early Greek philosophers and their notions about the shape of the universe and the planet Earth. Turns out that the idea of a round Earth was completely irrational! Nothing, in other words, is so simple as it seems. Loren Coleman's \"Incendiary Poltergeists, Spontaneous Human Combustion and Fire Suicide Clusters\" addresses mysterious fires as a whole, in- cluding their possible personal and political uses. Were you also aware that fire insurance in this country origi- nally grew out of a series of turn-of-the-century New York fire poltergeist cases? We thought not. Artist and psychic Ingo Swann weighs in with \"The Perils of Erasing Astrology From the Past.\" Regardless of one's personal opinion about celestial \"influences,\" there's no question but that our ancestors believed in what we call astrology, and that such studies led di- rectly to what we now know as astronomy and cosmol- ogy. Denying the connection may cause us to lose sight of our own cultural inheritance, as well as to seriously misread the intellect and motives of those cultures that went before. A brief commentary by noted anomalist William Corliss concludes the first issue of The Anomalist. What we are trying to do has been already mentioned—pro- vide a serious forum for the discussion of the odd and unusual in all their ramifications, or of what Charles Fort referred to as the \"damned,\" the excluded. What we are not trying to do is needlessly monger mystery, thus we will publish critical as well as \"supportive\" articles about a particular case or phenomenon. In the end, The Anomalist is intended to make you think for yourself, a faculty that could come in handy almost anywhere.

THE EXCLUDED MIDDLE Reviewed by Dennis Stacy The Excluded Middle (\"An Esoteric Journal for the Masses\") draws its name from a quote by Aristotle, the original of which I seem to have misplaced. The meaning is clear enough, however. In the field of extremes between kneejerk debunkers and believers, there must be some sort of common middle ground for the unwashed masses, i.e., the rest of us. At first glance, such an editorial policy would ap- pear to be a recipe for timidity and/or boredom. After all, given a choice among valley, peak and rolling farm- land, who wouldn't opt for the highs or lows of a par- ticular situation or phenomenon, as opposed to, say, the tried and true highway? When all is said and done, who goes on vacation with the intent of touring Middle McDonald America, when the Grand Canyon, Rocky Mountains and Florida Everglades beckon? Not to worry. Despite its title, The Excluded Middle is decidedly left of center, meaning it takes UFOs, abductions, near-death experiences and similar left field happenings and personalities seriously or it wouldn't be in business in the first place. Which is not to say its approach and attitutde to same is necessarily your approach and attitude to same. The first three issues have contained articles and interviews on the above mentioned subjects, along with articles on Aleister Crowley, Clay Shaw and Kennedy assassina- tion theories, contactee George Hunt Williamson, Bill Moore, false memories, and so on. There is a good mixture here of investigative historical reporting and contemporary interviews, derived from what might be called a younger generation's point of view. Contributors include Robert Anton Wilson and the regular West Coast staff of Gregory Bishop, Robert Larson and Peter Stenshoel. The overall emphasis is on UFOs and related subject matter. An annual subscription (four issues) is available for $20 from The Excluded Middle, P.O. Box 1077, Los Angeles, CA 90048. Highly recommended for a journal just finding its feet, and as a preview of things to come. Seems to be getting better and bigger with each issue. ROSWELL IN PERSPECTIVE By Karl T. Pflock FUFOR, paper, 189 pages, $25.00 Reviewed by Dennis Stacy Imagine you are asleep at night when a shadowy figure suddenly enters your bedroom. He pads quietly across the floor, shakes you awake by the throat and shouts in your ear, \"Roswell really was a balloon!\" then disap- pears through the door before you can react or cry out. That's about the sort of startling impact I expect this 189-page monograph to have on ufology as a whole, al- though I don't expect the author to vanish from view anytime soon. Titled Roswell in Perspective, it's written by Karl T. Pflock and is the preliminary report of an on- PAGE 16 NUMBER 315 JULY 1994"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL going two-year-old investigation into the Roswell Incident largely sponsored by the Fund for UFO Research. It's also a model of how any thorough, ob- jective UFO case investigation should be conducted, which is to let the chips fall where they may without try- ing to force-fit them into one's existing prior precon- ceptions or predilections. In the process, Pflock shatters several shibboleths or nuggets of accepted wisdom surrounding long ago events reported at or near Roswell, New Mexico, in the summer of 1947, while leaving one or two rela- tively intact. The Ramey press conference in Fort Worth on the afternoon of July 8, 1947, for example, which claimed the wreckage retrieved from the Foster ranch was that of an ordinary weather balloon, really was a deliberate cover-up. What was being covered- up in all probability, however, was a balloon of anoth- er type belonging to the supersecret Project Mogul. The latter—classified on a par with the Manhattan Project—was an attempt to monitor Soviet atomic bomb testing via acoustical sensors hauled into rela- tively stationary \"orbit\" at an altitude of approximate- ly 50,000 feet. Careful detective work, along with a trickle of just now emerging documentation, reveals a potential conglomerate of construction material— down to hardened balsa wood struts, monofilament wire and colored paper or tape—that closely resem- bles the debris first found by rancher Mac Brazel in early July and described by subsequent eyewitnesses. Moreover, some of the Mogul balloons were made of a newly fabricated material which ground personnel— Major Jesse Marcel and others included—probably would not have been familiar with, hence its seeming- ly \"anomalous\" nature. In fact, Pflock's overall case for Project Mogul is so persuasive that one can only wonder how critics will re- spond. My own prediction is that a number of attempts will be made to shoot the messenger, rather than the message, primarily by drawing attention to Pflock's past involvement with numerous government agencies, including a stint with both the Central Intelligence Agency and the Department of Defense. ((It should also be pointed out that he was involved early on with Keyhoe's NICAP and is presently providing informal as- sistance into the GAO investigation of the government's handling of Roswell and related documents.) Given the paranoid tendences of many within ufology, he is almost bound to be labeled a CIA \"spy\" or some other form of government UFO \"disinformation\" agent. To which one can really only retort: Read the report and decide for yourself. I should also note that Pflock is not wholly dismissive of everything revolving round Roswell and claims of a government cover-up; in fact, he maintains that bodies of some kind probably were recovered near Roswell, based primarily on the testimony of mortician Glenn Dennis. The author's arguments in this area aren't wholly con- vincing, however, if for no other reason than that once you've let the air out of a balloon, it's awfully hard to put it back in through the same hole. How likely is it, for example, that a highly classified terrestrial balloon pro- ject and an extraterrestrial spaceship with bodies aboard would have come to rest within 30 miles or less from one another, even assuming they had actually collided? Despite Mogul's dimensions—500 feet or more, top to bottom—it was made up of a series of small balloons, the mass of which would have been relatively negligible to anything remotely resembling a flying saucer as we've come to \"know\" it. T he ramifications of Pflock's Roswell report for the whole of ufology are such that it cannot conceiv- ably be ignored by any serious student of the subject. Many, after all, consider the Roswell Incident the most important UFO case of all time, the hinge from which the entire government cover-up of the subject hangs, not to mention allegations and rumors of MJ- 12 or some similar elite investigative agency formed in the wake of Roswell. As Pflock puts it in his introduction, \"A Parallax View\": \"Jerry Clark's judgement that Roswell is the most important case in UFO history may well be right on the mark. If the wreckage of an alien craft and the bodies of its crew were recovered on New Mexico's high desert in 1947, it goes without saying Roswell is the event of the millennium. Less obvious, perhaps, is the fact that, if it is proven a flying saucer and aliens were not involved, how ufology deals with this disap- pointing outcome will have profound and lasting con- sequences for the field.\" In short, is there life after Roswell? And if so, what is it going to look like? These are questions worth pondering. Roswell in Perspective is available from the Fund For UFO Research, P. O.

JULY 1994 NUMBER 315 PAGE 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Letters to Mufon UFO Journal CONTACTEE KLARER Elizabeth Klarer, age 83, the well-known South African UFO contactee, died in Durban's Highway Hospice in early February 1994. Elizabeth was always a controversial figure, both in South Africa and abroad. The story of her meeting with the \"space alien\" Akon, sometime in 1957, and her sub- sequent love affair with him, resulting in the birth of a son Ayling, not only raised eyebrows but often met with denigration and annoyance from the \"nuts and bolts\" UFO brigade. I first met Elizabeth in 1967 when I interviewed her for an article which subsequently appeared in FATE magazine in August of 1968. Whatever may have been said of her, she certainly told her story with great conviction and no fear of pub- lic condemnation as to her illicit liaison or illegitimate child. Later, in the seventies, during a trip to the USA. I spoke for the first time at a MUFON meeting in Quincy, Illinois, under the auspices of Walt Andrus and intro- duced by Joe Brill, and there is no doubt that Elizabeth's story was met with humour and almost total disbelief. I know that MUFON has never really been supportive of Elizabeth Klarer and her \"romantic tale\" of love and the bearing of a semi-alien child and I must admit that my own credibility was stretched to the limits to believe even the most basic facts. Elizabeth's story was simple: she first saw Akon and his craft from Flying Saucer Hill in the Drakensberg in South Africa. Her sister and brother-in-law owned a farm in the Mooi River area of Natal and Elizabeth would ride on her favourite horse to isolated areas. The first time she saw the craft, Akon stood at the window and watched her. The second time, he was already landed when she arrived and invited her inside. He then, with his pilot, took her for a ride. He was tall, extremely handsome, with high cheek-bones and slightly slanting grey eyes. Elizabeth was obviously greatly attracted to him. As time progressed, he visited her several times. They fell in love and she soon found herself pregnant. Later on in her pregnancy. Akon came to fetch her and she spent the remaining time until after the birth of her son Ayling (four months) on Maton, a planet of Proxima Centauri. All this is described in detail in her book Beyond the Light Barrier (Howard Timmins, Cape Town, South Africa). The book itself is romanticised to the nth degree and reads more like a woman's novel than an allegedly scientific report. But, despite all this, there are still many inexplicable factors to Elizabeth's story. Elizabeth was a woman of breeding; she was gentle. intellectual, well educated and numbered among her friends many academics and highly placed people in government and society. She came from an era where il- legitimacy was the hall-mark of the fallen woman: why would she choose a situation like this to publicise her story? Also, many features of her story are known now as typical of the contactee experience; the closing of the doors on the craft so that no entrance can be detected, for example. She says, \"The shining wall and door seemed to fuse and no openings remained.\" She also notes, \"The whole cabin was alight with this soft reflected light, the effect of light without shadows; no wiring or cables seemed to connect it.\" Akon says, \"We come from a double star system.\" The book was written in the early sixties. I viewed it in 1967. Elizabeth, via Akon, produces many statements about stars and star systems; could she have known about all this? Recently, an astronomer friend of mine wrote to say that planets surrounding Proxima Centauri (if there were any) would be unstable. I quote from Elizabeth's book, when Akon says, \"Proxima Centauri is like the sun, only with a reddish light and of course, a very stable star.\" But perhaps the most curious report is the one about the \"electric mirage.\" When flying in the craft, Elizabeth can see the Marine Parade in Durban, in perfect detail. She can also hear people speaking and recognizes what they are saying. She says, \"The scene materialised in front of us in colour, movement and sound, the mole- cules of air electrified and activated to reflect the scene and portray it before us as if we were standing on that very spot...\" What else but a hologram, unknown at the time, of course, to Elizabeth. Elizabeth Klarer died in comparitive poverty. She had very little money of her own and was looked after by her son David and daughter Marilyn and some gen- erous friends. Her incredible story brought her some fame (or more accurately, notoriety!) but certainly no riches. We will never know if Elizabeth's story was in her mind or a reality, but she never deserved the sly innu- endo and cruelty of the media. Whatever: I for one wish her only peace and perhaps a reunion with Akon, the man of her dreams. — Cynthia Hind P.O. Box MP 49 Mt.

ROSWELL REDUX In his letter in the June 1994 Journal, my colleague Kevin Randle makes a number of claims about Roswell- Corona case events which the record does not support. He also advances an \"interesting\" philosophy of inves- tigative reporting. Below I address the latter and the two most significant of the former. Randle writes that Frank Joyce claims to have \"in- terviewed Mac Brazel on the radio on [Sunday,] July 6.... That interview was broadcast, to the best of Joyce's memory, on Sunday afternoon [emphasis added].\" To my knowledge, this is the first time anyone has claimed Joyce interviewed Brazel on the air or, perhaps, recorded an interview with him which was broadcast later. Nowhere in any of the published accounts of Joyce's story—including Randle's two books on the case—is there any suggestion Joyce conducted a radio interview with Brazel. Nowhere in any of the videotaped news and research interviews with Joyce does he claim to have conducted a broadcast interview with the rancher (I have viewed and reviewed as many of these as I could find, including the complete, unedited interview con- ducted by Randle for the Fund for UFO Research). Further, when I interviewed Joyce (November 3, 1992), he made no mention of having broadcast an in- terview with Brazel. In fact, he told me he did not think much of his first contact with the rancher (a telephone conversation with Brazel as he sat in the Chaves County sheriff's office on July 6 or 7), except that the man \"might be a little crazy.\" He told me that, after sug- gesting Brazel or the sheriff contact Roswell Army Air Field, he went back to his disk jockey and news duties and neither thought much nor did anything more about the matter until the Army's famous captured flying saucer press announcement was released a day or two later. Also, none of the numerous newspaper and wire ser- vice accounts of the story makes any mention of a radio interview with Brazel. Moreover, except for those few who had direct or official knowledge—and, of course, Frank Kaufmann (AKA Steve MacKenzie)—not one of the many people who were in Roswell at the time of the incident whom I have interviewed remembers hear- ing about Brazel's find until the story broke on the af- ternoon of Tuesday, July 8.1 asked each explicitly if he or she had heard any reports or rumors about the dis- covery before July 8, and all said they had not. Which brings me to Randle's assertions that the Army's press release was \"designed to stop the spread of the rumors begun on Sunday by Joyce's broadcast \"about strange debris\" and to direct attention away from the impact site just north of Roswell where a craft and bodies are alleged to have been found. With respect to the former, there is not the slightest shred of evidence or credible testimony that there was such a broadcast or that there were any such rumors being put about. As for the latter, according to Randle, this was accomplished by re- ferring to \"a site 75 miles northwest of Roswell,\" which among other things led to \"a newspaper story in the af- ternoon paper.. . [claiming] the 'real' site was 75 miles from Roswell.\" In fact, the release as reproduced by the Associated Press and several major newspapers (the only form in which it is available today) makes ab- solutely no reference to such a location. Rather, it states \"the flying object landed on a ranch near Roswell some- time last week [emphasis added].\" As for the Roswell Daily Record story to which Randle refers, it states, \"According to information re- leased . . . over the authority of Maj. Jesse A. Marcel, in- telligence officer, the disk was recovered on a ranch in the Roswell vicinity [emphasis added].\" Clearly, if the purpose of the press release was to squelch nonexistent rumors and divert attention from the \"important find\" near Roswell, the perpetrators should have been cashiered from the Army for gross incompetence or, perhaps, disabled out as suffering from debilitating delu- sions. Let me now consider Randle's curious philosophy of investigative reporting. With respect to the second- and third-hand and uncorroborated testimony of Frankie Rowe, Ruben Anaya, Barbara Dugger, and others re- garding the alleged survival of \"one of the beings,\" he notes \"we included . . . [it] in the book [The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell] because that was what the witnesses were saying. We felt an obligation to JULY 1994 NUMBER 315 PAGE 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL report, accurately, all that we had been told.\" Concerning inconsistencies in this and other testimony reported in Truth, he writes, \"I believe we have an obligation to re- port all the data, not just that which we believe.\" This is the throw-anything-and-everything-against- the-wall-to-see-what-will-stick school of \"investigative journalism,\" and it has no place in serious investigative research. Such a philosophy \"relieves\" the investigator of any obligation to analyze what sources say, to com- pare the stories with known facts and each other, to carefully sort the wheat from the chaff from the \"to be determined,\" and to make clear distinctions among these categories in his or her reporting. It may sell books, but it also sells out the search for the truth — Karl T.

WORD FROM WHITLEY Dear Reader: I would like to thank you for taking the time and ef- fort to write me, and to tell you a little bit about what happened to your letter, and what's been going on with me. First, I read your letter personally, and if it con- tained a description of experiences that was appropriate, it was then placed into the database of the Communion Foundation. This database is made available only to academically qualified scientists and doctors, and only with their written agreement to keep the names in it confidential. In 1995,1 am going to publish a new book about the visitors. The working title is Beyond Communion: The Coming Moment of Contact. The reason that I'm going to do this is that there have been urgent changes. I understand why we cannot yet have permanent contact with the visitors in the phys- ical world, and what we need to do to change that. In the months between August of 1993 and January of 1994,1 had dozens of encounters, leading up to one that came within inches of permanent contact. I feel that we're right on the razor's edge, and I'm hoping that the new book will enable us to make the breakthrough we've all been struggling toward for so long. I've discovered, also, that everybody is equal in this: my letters tell me that nobody is being singled out, nobody is special. Everybody reaches about the same level of contact at the same time so when one breaks through to a new level, it's because everybody else is also ready. To answer a few commonly asked questions: 1. The Communion Letter is no longer published. I published twelve issues over two years, and back issues are not available. 2. On my last television appearance, I said that I didn't think that the visitors were aliens, but that didn't mean that I thought they were some sort of dream. They are the most complex phenomenon humanity has ever encountered, and labeling them just pushes them away. What the visitors are is unknown, and we are never go- ing to move this ahead unless we can learn to face them with empty minds. Again, thanks for writing me. I'm sorry that I couldn't answer you personally, but I get around five hundred letters a month. — Whitley Strieber GEORGE R. COYNE 1918-1994 Former Central Regional Director, George R.

It lies near the crescent Moon on August 3. Saturn lies in the SE at dawn. Meteor Shower: In recent years the Perseids have put on a spectacular show owing to its passage through a dense portion of debris from the shower's parent comet. An intense extra peak (300 mete- ors per hour) has preceded the normal peak (60- 100/hour). If this year's extra maximum occurs at all, one prediction places it between 4 and 7 AM EOT on August 12, favoring North America. An earlier or later peak would favor Europe or the western U.S. (and Hawaii), respectively. The normal peak is expected on the night of the 12th-13th.

LARRY KING TO NARRATE UFO PROGRAM On October 1, 1994, Larry King will provide the com- mentary for a two hour TV UFO special on the TNT network. It has been in production for several months, however we are unable to disclose any details, except to say the Roswell case will be featured and Area-51. Mr. King made a brief announcement to this event on his program, \"Larry King Live\" on CNN, the evening Michael Walsh and Walt Andrus were guests, discussing western Michigan sightings. COSMIC CONSPIRACY: SIX DECADES OF GOVERNMENT UFO COVER-UPS For those of you who do not subscribe to OMNI maga- zine or buy it at the newsstands, the April 1994 issue— a UFO special—inaugurated a six-part monthly series by our own Dennis Stacy, editor of the MUFON UFO Journal, running through the September 1994 issue. Editor-at-large Pamela Weintraub is to be congratu- lated not only for their UFO special, but for recognizing the writing talent of Mr. Stacy. We heartily recommend the six-part series to all of our members and readers. NATIONAL UFO INFORMATION WEEK Virginia M. Tilly, Director of Public Education, has an- nounced that the National UFO Information Week has been scheduled for August 13 through 21, 1994, which includes two weekends. Now is the time to start prepar- ing exhibits, information literature handouts, closed cir- cuit TV of UFO videotapes, and specifically making reservations at local shopping malls and libraries. This is an ideal event to educate the public to the UFO phe- nomenon and its implications to the scientific future of the world. FIELD INVESTIGATOR'S MANUAL OUT OF PRINT The third edition of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual is temporarily out-of-print. It has been removed from the MUFON Publications List. Work is progress- ing very well on publishing an expanded version to be identified as the fourth edition in the near future. Please do not delay conducting Field Investigator training classes due to the absence of the fourth edition. Some sections or chapters of the present manual are only be- ing updated, whereas new sections on abduction inves- tigations, animal mutilations, crop circles, and poly- graph will be new. Explicit instructions on completing Form I and Form 2 will also be new. An expanded sec- tion on interviewing witnesses by Dan Wright will be an asset to the new manual. The availability date and price will be announced in the Journal. Please do not back order the new manual since it will be doubled in size, and the price has not been determined from the printer. We are excited about the fourth edition, since it will be a state-of-the art pub- lication. THE ROSWELL DECLARATION OMNI magazine will publish a two-page spread in their October 1994 issue in which they will explain the Roswell Declaration and on the second page the actual Roswell Declaration as published by IUR and the MU- FON UFO Journal. Signed copies of the Declaration will be sent to either the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) or the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON). MUFON has already received over 1700 signed declarations from the original articles by Kent Jeffrey. NEW OFFICERS ELECTED TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS At the annual MUFON Board of Director's Meeting in Austin, Texas on July 10th, T. David Spencer (Austin, TX) was elected to the position of Deputy Director, Investigations, to fill the vacancy created by the un- timely death of Jerold Robert \"Ron\" Johnson. Mr. Spencer will continue to fill the role of UFO Database Administrator. The Regional Directors will forward their completed UFO sighting reports to Mr. Spencer at 6700 Woodcrest, Austin, TX 78759 for final approval and entry into the MUFON computer database file. The board also elected Tom M. Whitmore (San Antonio. TX) to become the new Treasurer to replace John Donegan who is retiring from the board and ex- ecutive committee. Mr. Donegan has faithfully served as MUFON's Treasurer for 19 years after MUFON moved its headquarters from Quincy, Illinois to Seguin, Texas in 1975. Mr. Whitmore is also the State Section Director for Bexar County (Texas) and will be a very active member of MUFON's Executive Committee. He will also be responsible for UFO research grant funds payable through MUFON by the Bigelow Foundation. Our office manager in Seguin, Mrs. Virginia Castner, will also become Assistant Treasurer, since she has basically filled this role for the past 17 years. GULF BREEZE UFO PHOTO ANALYZED Recognition and thanks must be extended to Bland Pugh for his coordination of the feature article appear- ing in the June 1994 issue of the Journal and to Ed Walters for the use of his enlarged color photographs.

POTENTIAL BREAKTHROUGH IN UFOLOGY A very significant UFO meeting was held in St. Louis, Missouri, on June 17, 18, and 19 where the officers or representatives of the three major UFO groups in the United States—CUFOS, FUFOR, and MUFON—met to organize a coalition council to administer cooperative UFO grants. Financial funding has been made avail- able to support the most ambitious program to fund re- search and investigation in UFO history. At an appro- priate time and place, a press release from the three participating organizations will announce further de- tails on this major breakthrough. UFOS: THE BEST EVIDENCE George Knapp, TV UFO documentary producer, has just released the first of a series of UFO related video documentaries titled UFOs: The Best Evidence,\" com- posed of a set of three tapes subtitled \"The Visitors,\" \"Strange Encounters.\" and \"The Government Coverup.\" In my opinion, this three-volume documentary series is the finest produced to date and comes highly recom- mended. The three programs are now selling for the introduc- tory price of $59.95 plus $6.95 for shipping and han- dling. If you purchase the handsomely-boxed videos now, you will receive a bonus of a few dozen pages of authentic UFO documents, squeezed out of our reluctant government through the Freedom of Information Act.
