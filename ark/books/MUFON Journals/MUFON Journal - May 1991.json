Taff Parapsychologist and Ufologjst laff is also a Hollywood screenplay writer. In the period from 1974 through 1977, few if any Ufologists believed that ex- traterrestrials were literally waltzing into people's homes within densely populated cities and abducting them for examina- tion and experimentation. Even after books like The Interrupted Journey by John G. Fuller and its TV movie, \"The UFO Incident,\" starring James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons, and Budd Hopkin's Missing Time (1981), most UFO researchers found it difficult to ac- cept or even believe that E.T.s were so bold and brazen as to literally come directly into one's home and kidnap them right out from under their fami- ly's noses. It was extremely hard for in- vestigators to even come to grip with the notion that large numbers of people might be being abducted to begin with, never mind why it always seemed to oc- cur in remote, desolate locations, far from major population centers. However, by 1990, . things have substantially and radically changed regarding UFO abductions and our perception of the possible magnitude of their occurrence. For one, most Ufolo- gists now generally agree that abduc- tions may, in fact, occur, and appear to be transpiring at an ever increasing rate, and that such events may have been transpiring for many decades. In fact, of the various types of Close En- counters, I-IV, IV being an abduction, it now appears as if CE-IV's may be the most common variety. With the publication of Budd Hopkins' second book, Intruders, and Whitley Strieber's Communion, its subsequent motion picture, his follow- ing books, Transformation and Ma- jestic, not to mention the plethora of motion picture and TV movies dealing with UFOs and a seeming wave of ab- duction reports from around the world, the entire UFO research community is well aware of the fact that these forces, or beings, may, in fact, frequently MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 277 May 1991"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"violate our most sacred privacy to serve their own needs. Unfortunately, the closed-minded attitude existing more than a decade ago pervaded my own mentality and caused me to overlook what might have been two very signifi- cant abduction cases; one in 1974, another in 1977 where I was actually present during the abduction! In the summer of 1974, while work- ing out of UCLA's Parapsychology Laboratory in the Neuropsychiatric In- stitute (since disbanded), I was refer- red by Dr. A, a psychiatrist at the NPI, to one of his patients, Ann, who com- plained of strange, diminuitive night visitors who did horrible things to her, one of which included impregnating her and eventually taking away her unborn fetus. Under normal circumstances Dr. A would have assumed (with good reason) that Ann's fears were the result of paranoid delusions of supernatural persecutors, however, her stories had a strange ring of reality and truth about them which is why I was consulted. Dr. A felt that as he could be of no assist- ance to her, perhaps I and our lab could be. Was he wrong on that account! N eedless to say, when I first met with Ann and heard her stories I was very skeptical of her claims regarding nocturnal presences. I spent several hours talking with her about her experiences, her personal background and any and all associated matters. My conclusion was that Ann was unquestionably suffering from acute trauma and anxiety brought on by some unknown stimuli. Her background revealed no evidence of any childhood abuse or neglect that might lead to nightmares or fantasies of being manipulated and sexually violated. Similarly, there were no other relation- ships in her past or present that would even suggest that her \"visitors\" were the product of a stigmatized imagination. When Ann finally felt more comfor- table talking with me, she confided more details than she had to Dr. A, perhaps because I was about the same age she was at the time, twenty-six. Her story, now quite common by abduction accounts, was that several small humanoids (my word usage) appeared out of nowhere within her bedroom and before she could put up a struggle rendered her semi-conscious through some form of paralysis. The next thing Ann recalled was ly- ing on her back on some type of metallic table in a roundish room, also metal-looking, that was emitting brilliant light from the walls and ceil- ing. Around her were either three or four humanoids. Her description of the \"funny-looking men\" is again very reminiscent of what we are now very used to hearing: 3-4 feet tall, hairless, slim with very large, inverted pear- shaped heads with no outer ears, no ap- parent nose except for two vertical slits and no lips except for another horizon- tal slit where the mouth should be. Ann's most disturbing memory of their physical appearance was their eyes. Large, dark, reflective and almond-shaped, angling up away from the horizontal about 15 degrees. Sound familiar? While these humanoids were \"ex- amining\" her she never heard them audibly speak, but seemed to sense their words in her mind, as if telepathic in nature. Though she said it was as clear as if they verbally spoke, their slit- for-a-mouth never moved. Their skin, according to Ann's recall, was greyish brown and was leathery in its texture. They did not have five fingers. The shape of their hands, which included webs between their three fingers and an opposing thumb-like digit, looked rep- tilian to Ann, who still found herself in a state of total muscular paralysis, except for her autonomic nervous system. As the humanoids began a more detailed examination of Ann, her memory began to cloud over as the be- ings kept repeating to her that she had nothing to fear, she would feel no pain and would not remember these events. Ann's memory concluded at this point with the apparent insertion of some type of probes into various bodily orifices: nasal, mouth, ear canal, rectal and vaginal. These probes were quite pain- ful and caused her to scream and cry. At that point, just before Ann lost con- sciousness, she remembered one of the humanoids placing its hand over her head, telling her not to feel any pain and to simply relax. Ann then blacked out. While conveying these details to me, her emotional state became more in- tense, eventually ending in a crying binge that lasted for quite some time which required immediate attention to calm her down as she was on the verge of hysteria. Finally calmed, Ann said that she knew the beings or whatever they were, were going to come back and get her again. A fter hearing the above story, I was startled and really didn't know what to believe. Ann was a well-educated, intelligent, emotional- ly balanced woman who, other than her supposed dreams, demonstrated ab- solutely no overt or covert signs of emo- tional disorders. In fact, everything in her life up until that point was as nor- mal as apple pie. However, her level of fear and an- xiety was so acute that I reluctantly agreed to spend several nights on the sofa in case the humanoids reappeared. After several nights on a very uncom- fortable couch with no visitations, I convinced Ann that everything would be fine and to call me if anything unusual occurred. About two months or so later she called back, saying that the humanoids had again reappeared in her bedroom and basically repeated the same pro- cedures they had performed original- ly. However, this time Ann said she was pregnant but couldn't account for it as she was using birth control which up until then proved very reliable. The last thing Ann wanted was an unplanned pregnancy, especially when she hadn't been sleeping with anyone in many months! Upon hearing this update, I was very reserved in my opinion regarding this entire affair as it was extremely \"strange\" and I felt more than likely could be explained very prosaically. The real shocker came several weeks later when in literal hysteria, Ann called late one evening to inform me that her fetus had disappeared from her womb, and that the little humanoids were the ones who removed it. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 277 May 1991"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"After visiting with her again and calming her down,. I tried to convince Ann that perhaps she had nothing more than a hysterical or false pregnancy, which is not that uncommon. However, Ann was not dissuaded by my attempt at logic, especially as she swore that she didn't have an abortion, that she really was pregnant, with tests to clinically prove it, and couldn't explain who fathered her child. During another lengthy session Ann told me of her encounter in which the little humanoids took her unborn fetus away. It again had all the earmarks and keynotes of what is now being reported quite frequently by Budd Hopkins and others. There was little I or anyone else could do to bring peace to Ann's mind. Eventually we were able to convince her that none of these events were in fact real, but simply the products of night terrors and that she would even- tually overcome her anxieties and fears regarding them. Well, she never really recovered in full. Her present life, what little is left of it after three failed marriages and numerous jobs she was unable to keep, is primarily due to a dramatic change in her personality. Ann was not the recipient of any form of therapy re- garding her possible encounter with whatever phenomena she experienced. Had such therapy been received, there's a good chance that her life today would be far more stable and rewarding. I have not heard from or of her since late 1979 and have been unable to locate her. I cannot help but wonder as to what we might have learned and how her life and emotional make-up might have evolved had I been less nearsighted in my a priori judgment of her ex- periences? T he second case occurred in Ju- ly of 1977 and was far more per- sonal as it involved a young woman, Margie, who was a close friend I originally met during an in- vestigation of poltergeist activity within the apartment her and her boyfriend resided in. The thirty-year-old woman was a model and an aspiring actress who bore a striking resemblance to a cross between a young Elizabeth Taylor While these humanoids were \"examining\" her she never heard them audibly speak, but seemed to sense their words in her mind, as if telepathic in nature. Though she said it was as clear as if they verbally spoke, their slit-for-a-mouth never moved. and Joan Collins. After my initial investigation of her case in the West Los Angeles area dur- ing which we recorded some audible phenomena, Margie and I grew to become quite close friends, during which time I discovered that she was extremely \"gifted\" in the sense of be- ing overtly telepathic, clairvoyant and precognitive, which allowed her to work with us in our UCLA lab. Over time, our relationship blossomed into a romantic affair and everything was going along smoothly. About the only oddities were Margie's occasional in- trusions into my own inner thoughts when she would literally tell me what I was thinking about although she had no knowledge of such information through our relationship or our cur- rent conversation. This happened with such frequency that I began accepting it as normal. Her psychic talents were multi-faceted in the respect that she was very helpful in looking for miss- ing persons and/or property, cases which we investigated many times every year. Another interesting phenomena oc- curred while I was massaging Margie's lower lumbar region which always gave her pain. In the midst of attempting to rub out the pain, a ball of brilliant light, similar to ball lightning and about the size of two large male fists, literally emerged from her lower back and headed straight up. The ball was self-illuminating and lit up the otherwise dimly lit room. Both Margie and I bolted at the appearance of the glowing sphere which disap- peared into the ceiling of the room without so much as a sound. As time moved on, more phenomena continued to occur while I was around Margie. Several times while visiting her apartment in the Hollywood hills, all the clocks in her house, which normally kept perfect time, suddenly and for no apparent reason began desynchronizing. Each clock was keeping its own special time, none of which were accurate. In fact, one of the clocks in the den ac- tually jumped off the wall, landing several feet from the location where it hung. As I first met Margie under con- ditions and circumstances strongly sug- gesting the manifestation of recurrent episodes of spontaneous psychokinesis, or what's more commonly referred to as poltergeist activity, I felt that this might just simply be another outbreak of this phenomena. However, nothing could be further from the truth as I was soon to discover. Having first met Margie in February of 1977, we had now known each other for approximately five months as it was July. She had a personal background of enduring emotional hardship and stress related to the untimely death of her older beloved sister from lung cancer and the very early death of her bio- logical father from alcoholism. Need- less to say, these are heavy burdens for anyone to bear, but even more so for Margie as her mother didn't really help raise her, but supplied her with a governess. Margie's stepfather worked for one of the U.S. government's in- telligence agencies and was never really around. Therefore, Margie grew up essentially without any real parental guidance. Given all this, Margie displayed ex- ceptionally normal patterns of behavior and appeared very well adjusted and balanced in terms of her interaction with others. Whatever emotional scars remained from her youth, they seemed well healed. However, in mid-July of 1977 all of Margie's sense of reality, well-being and peace of mind was forever shattered. She woke up one morning and was very disturbed by a dream she had that eve- MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 277 May 1991"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"ning. At least she first thought it was a dream. Margie turned toward me in bed and began telling me of her nightmare. She remembered being somehow levitated out of bed, ending up in a strange round metal room bathed in blinding white light. Suddenly, she found herself ly- ing on some sort of pedestal-like metal table in the middle of this room, sur- rounded by small men with big heads and large dark eyes without lids. The men were very strange looking accord- ing to Margie, as they didn't have ears, nose, lips or hair. Margie became very frightened and attempted to get off the table, only to discover herself paralyzed and re- strained at her neck, waist, wrists and ankles by some sort of invisible mech- anism. The next thing she recalled was one of the little men bringing a large, round eye-like device down over her body and running it from her head down to her toes. During this strange \"scanning\" procedure, Margie could see different colored lights going on and off on a wall near her. Then another one of the tiny men brought out a device and began inserting it into her nasal orifice, her ear, mouth, rectum and finally her vagina. The insertion of this \"probe\" or whatever it was, was ex- tremely painful and Margie began cry- ing, even while relating the dream to me. After the pain subsided she lost consciousness and finally woke up back in her bed. My first question to Margie was whether or not she was at all familiar with any UFO stories or literature, or had ever seen \"The UFO Incident\" on TV or read The Interrupted Journey. Her reply was \"no\" and that she never really had any interest whatsoever in UFOs or even believed in them (this was before Close Encounters of the Third Kind came out). Margie asked me why I was asking her about UFOs after having such a weird dream or nightmare. I answered that I was just curious, that's all. As soon as Margie got out of bed my curiosity turned into shock and hers in- to terror. For around Margie's wrists, ankles, waist and neck were black-and- blue bands of discoloration as if she'd been held in tight restraints for some time. Equally disturbing was the fact that Margie was bleeding from her nose, left ear canal and her uterus, although she was not menstruating. Were these the remnants or scars of a physical examination performed by extraterrestrials who abducted her while she slept and her interpretation of the event was a nightmare? Or was it a form of stigmata? More puzzling is that we were sleeping right next to each other in the same bed and I slept the entire night through undisturbed. How could any agency have removed her from the space directly adjacent to me without waking me? To say that these wounds and scars strongly sug- gest mishandling by someone not that familiar with human anatomy and physiology, and that the experience was traumatizing, would be the greatest understatement of the century. E ven as someone who had been studying Ufology for more than 16 years, I couldn't bring my- self to accept the possibility that an alien entity, or entities, may have entered her house in the middle of the night within the densely populated Hollywood Hills and abducted her right out from under my arms. Fourteen years ago, no serious Ufologist believ- ed that such events occurred, especially right in front of them. In that I didn't take Margie's \"dream\" or encounter seriously and felt that it might be a form of psychogenic reac- tion formation, Margie did not receive or seek any form of therapy for her ex- perience. Since 1977, Margie's per- sonality has almost completely disintegrated into a vegetative state in that she's become a religious zealot who literally lives to worship Sai Baba, a supposed East Indian avatar. She now believes it was he who actually visited her on the night of her encounter. Supposedly, Margie has had repeated nocturnal visitations by this being/en- tity/avatar and it has performed somewhat similar procedures on her again. Her emotional state is so frag- mented and disassociated from reality that she has been unable to hold down MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 277 May 1991"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"any form of employment, keep any close friends or relationships (except of course for those others who are also Sai Baba devotees), and has gone through numerous interpersonal relationships and a failed marriage. Margie is ob- sessed with the notion that she must live and breathe only for Sai Baba. Follow- ing her first encounter with whatever affected her physically and emotional- ly back in 1977, her psychic abilities became so tainted and distorted by her deluded sense of spirituality that they became virtually useless for all intents and purposes of research and law enforcement. Interestingly, following Margie's ab- duction and continuing for some time, she has experienced repeated outbreaks of poltergeist activity and apport phenomena, which she naturally as- sumed was due to Baba. The most intriguing event to follow Margie's initial abduction was when one of her close friends, also a Sai Baba devotee, also claimed to have had an abduction-like experience totally independent of Margie's. This also launched her into total spiritual zealotism. Later, she desired to have a child with her husband. She went to visit Sai Baba in India to literally ask his permission in order to have the child (both Margie and her friend [s] went to India at least once a year \"to be one with Baba\"). Nevertheless, Baba gave Margie's friend his blessing and of course told her to have a child if that is what she desired. Several months after Margie's friend conceived, she went to have a routine examination during which a sonogram was performed. The ultrasonic image revealed that there was no fetus in her womb, although she manifested every physical symptom of pregnancy! What's particularly interesting about this missing fetus is that it followed closely on the heels of what appeared to be another alleged abduction as described by Margie's friend, who of course, believed it was all the work of Baba, who took away her child due to some sin or infraction on her part. It is incredibly coincidental that another incident of an abduction-like scenario wherein a woman's fetus may have been Her emotional state is so fragmented and disas- sociated from reality that she has been unable to hold down any form of employment, and has gone through numerous interpersonal relationships and a failed marriage. removed from her by what might have been extraterrestrial intelligences is related to a woman who very likely was abducted in 1977 while sleeping inches away from me in the same bed. There may not be any direct proof or hard evidence that alien entities were in any way involved in the aforemen- tioned experiences, but the circumstan- tial evidence in terms of the vestigal scars certainly speak for themselves and there isn't the slightest indication that any of these women discussed here in- flicted any of their bodily wounds or scars upon themselves, nor would they have desired to. In conclusion, one might say that if it weren't for the close-minded attitude of this author back between 1974 and 1977, we may have actually come a lot closer to possibly understanding the nature of this phenomena, especially as this was all transpiring in our own backyards, so-to-speak.

Moreover, the most important loss is the personalities of the three women who will never again be the same or lead a normal life. It hurts to realize that we came so incredibly close to actual- ly linking up with this phenomena. But, the pain of allowing these women to go untreated, without therapy, will be a burden I and other colleagues of mine will have to bear for many years to come. No amount of knowledge or ac- quired information is worth their peace of mind, sanity and emotional well- being. Only now do we perhaps have our sense of priorities and respon- sibilities straight.

T his UFO sighting occurred in West Jordon, Utah, September 16, 1990, at 7:52 p.m. The witnesses, Denise and Steven Had- denham, were on their way home from eating Sunday dinner with Steve's brother and his family at a Greek restaurant on 3rd West at 2750 South. Steve and Denise and their two children, Courtney, 6 and Joshua, 5, were in their car, and the brother and his family were following in their car. As they left the parking lot of the restaurant, Denise's attention was drawn to something moving in the sky. Look- ing from the passenger's seat out the right front window toward the west, she saw what she first thought was a gray wisp of cloud; but as she focused on it, she could see that it was a silver, disc-shaped object with a dome and top moving at a rapid speed from north to south. She quickly pointed it out to her hus- band. He said, \"What the hell is it?\" and pulled the car over to the curb and stopped. The street is a commercial thoroughfare at this point, used large- ly by trucks avoiding the central business district a few blocks to the east, and at this time on a Sunday even- ing it is nearly deserted. They both jumped from the car, ad- monishing the children to remain in the back seat. From where they were stand- ing, they watched the object fly at about a 60° angle above the horizon, passing from the northwest to the southeast, and disappearing behind a grove of tall trees on the opposite side of 3rd West, about a half mile to the south. I drive from 39th South to 21st South on 3rd West every week to work as a volunteer at the State Library for the Blind and Physically Handicapped. Coming home today, I checked my odometer for the distances involved in this sighting. At the restaurant the odometer was halfway between .1 and .2, at the place where they stopped it was at .7, and when I passed the grove of trees where they lost sight of it the reading was .9. The object was moving so rapidly that by the time Steve's brother pulled up behind them and he got out to ask what was the matter, the object was already out of sight. Unfortunately, the other family members did not see it. Two Full Moons From where the Haddenhams live in West Jordon, a Salt Lake City suburb southwest of town, they have a view of planes approaching Salt Lake Interna- tional Airport for landing. They estimated the speed of the object as three to four times faster than an airplane. As to the size, I first asked them how it compared with a full moon. They both said \"bigger,\" and after some discussion agreed it was as big as two full moons. Next, I asked how it would compare in size to a coin held at arm's length. Again they agreed that it was bigger than a coin. Holding out their arms and circling fingers and thumb, they suggested it would be more like the size of a yo-yo. \"It was the size of a ci- ty block,\" they said. They saw no lights, but what ap- peared to be a gray metallic disc with a dome on top reflected light from the sun below the horizon. Although the sun had set, the sky was still blue and clear except for two thin clouds to the south. These clouds were not moving and there was no wind. A shimmer of air seemed to follow the object, like heat rising from a hot surface. They estimated that it was in view for about 30 seconds. In my opinion, this may be a little low, considering that Denise saw it first as they left the restaurant, showed it to Steve, and they were about two blocks down the road before they stopped the car and got out. Steve recalled later that as they stood watching the UFO they heard dogs howling. (We heard no dogs when we visited the site.) They were both excited about the sighting. Denise's mother was visiting at the Haddenham's apartment when Mara Ulis, Les Beard and I were there for the interview, and she told us that when Denise called her that evening to tell her about it she had never heard so much excitement in her daughter's voice. After calling her mother, Denise called the county sheriff, the Hanson Planetarium, the Salt Lake airport, and Hill Air Force base near Ogden. No one had received any UFO reports that day, and no one offered a possible ex- planation. The officer she spoke with at Hill gave her the Seattle number for the National UFO Reporting Center. Robert Gribble took the information and forwarded it to Walt Andrus in Seguin. I received it two weeks later. I phoned Denise and talked to her on the phone, then made an appointment to visit her with Mara and Les the next day. We talked with the couple, her mother and 1 the two children. After fill- ing out the General Case Form, we followed the Haddenhams to the place where they stopped to watch the UFO. They showed us where the object was when they first saw it, how it moved, and where it went out of sight behind the trees. Les shot pictures. The Haddenhams impressed me with their sincerity. He is a plumber; she is a crossing guard for the Jordon school district. They are both members of the Mormon church and do not smoke, drink or use drugs. Their eyesight is good; she was wearing contacts needed for distant vision.

Journals and mag- azines are gearing up for the expected summer onslaught as are, too, no doubt, numerous news organizations and the local landowners themselves. Look for roadside concession stands selling Guinness by the pint and T-shirts by the dozen. Look for loads of new ex- planations and \"translations,\" too, while a rationale as to why any self- respecting \"non-human intelligence\" would want to waste its time writing circles in wheat fields goes wanting. Look for more hoaxes, too, and then look for the role of the latter in this whole mystery to go largely over- looked. A case in point demonstrates the pitfalls of taking each and every Cir- cle at gospel face value. According to an article by John Haddington (Earl of Haddington is the patron of the Centre for Crop Circle Studies), \"Doons Law, The Whitsome Pictogram,\" which ap- peared in the April/May 1991 issue of Global Link Up, an English New Age journal, three Circles appeared over two nights last August in Scotland, near the village of Duns. Doons Law is an old burial mound. Two Circles 32 and 31-feet in diam- eter were found, along with a smaller Circle 16 feet in diameter. Without a plan of the formation itself to go by, working out the exact arrangement is hard to do, but apparently two of the Circles (one large and one small?) were connected to the other by flattened pathways like those seen in the giant dumb-bell formations found in Wilt- shire and southern England last sum- mer. The latter, however, were flattened along their length, whereas these were flattened perpendicular to their long course and each in a different direction. \"A new development, and one that should be carefully noted,\" Haddington writes. More oddities were found. One of the Circles was swept flat in an anticlock- wise direction, while the other two lay swirled clockwise. Moreover, the two pathways, each some 16 and Vi feet long, if I read right, were angled 67 degrees to one another. One pathway pointed straight toward the old burial mound and beyond, to either the kirk (church) at Swinton or Norham, the other to the kirk at either Norham or Swinton. Needless to say, I'm working here without a map. Weirder still, the distance to both kirks is identical, creating an isoceles triangle, and a 14th century knight is buried at each. Moreover, Haddington adds, \"a line drawn from Doons Law in a Westerly direction towards the Eildon Hills, goes through a \"Bastle\" which is an ancient defensive tower at Charterhall, the standing stone at Whiteside on Mellerstain Estate, and finally through the Eildon tree stone which marks the spot where in the 13th century Thomas the Rhymer met the beautiful Faery Queen wearing green and riding on a white horse. She took him away for seven years into the Eildon Hills where he was entertained by the little people all that time ... He was duly sent home with the gift of pro- phecy and healing and became famous for his divination. All of his pro- nouncements have to date come to pass.\" Again, without a map, it's hard to know exactly what a \"Westerly line\" really means, and how precise all these alignments actually are, although Had- dington assures us that three years ago he \"dowsed a twelve bar ley line run- ning from (the fallen monolith at Whiteside) down the field side in an easterly direction but had only traced it as far as Hume Crags. However since this latest development (the three Circles), the full extent of this line can be traced from the Witches Knowe (another hill) at Mordington to Doons Law and through the Whiteside Stone to the Eildon Hills.\" That this all seems too neat and nice never seems to have entered into Had- dington's calculations, and the reason why is probably partly explained by his intention in writing the original article, which was to refute the claims of \"coin- cidence\" lodged against similar alleged triangles and alignments in Wiltshire and southern England, where known ancient archeological sites are much more numerous than in Haddington's native Scotland. Thus, this latest isolated and spectacular alignment, in the form of an isoceles triangle yet, can be held up as \"proof positive that something exceedingly strange and wonderful is indeed afoot within the Circles. \"Maybe,\" Haddington continues, \"this is the start of a series of circles in the Scottish borders. Certainly the pattern is the same as in the south with sites of historical importance linked with ley lines, being chosen by the cir- cle makers. I cannot help but feel that this event of the arrival of a crop circle at this particular spot, Doons Law, is of great importance. Does it not show quite clearly to all who previously doubted, that there is a connection be- tween ley lines, burial mounds and the Circles? \"It is easy in Wiltshire to think such a connection to be purely coincidental, as there is a great proliferation of burial mounds within the region. Not so in the Borders, they are relatively scarce here and are far apart geographically. Besides the Doons Law circle anchors itself in the landscape with the triangle connecting it to the two churches, and points significantly at the Eildon tree stone and the Lady in Green. Plasma Vorticans take note.\" \"Captain Kirk\" The rest of us would do well to take note and learn from Haddington's ex- perience as well. Apparently the Circles to which he refers are the same ones which a trio of pranksters ad- MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 277 May 1991"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"I mitted hoaxing in the Glasgow Herald of February 14 of this year. I haven't seen the original article as yet, although I've written for a copy, and so am refer- ring here only to excerpts and com- ments made by Jenny Randies in the latest (April 1991) issue of Northern UFO News. The internal descriptions, however, leave little doubt that the hoaxed formation is the same one reported by Haddington. The hoaxers spoke only pseudononymously as \"Captain Kirk,\" but told how they entered the farmer's field along the ubi- quitous tram (tractor) lines and went to work, \"using a 16-foot wooden batten, and a three-foot steel pin and a few pints (of beer)!\" I'm not sure exactly what a wooden batten is, but we'll presume here it's a plank 16 feet long in this case, and perhaps a foot wide. The metal pin was inserted into the ground and then through a hole in the middle of the plank, which swept out the first 16-foot diameter Circle. Repositioning the pin at any point around the perimeter and using it as an achor point for either end of the 16-foot plank then results in a roughly 32-foot diameter Circle. (Try it! It works.) The pathways between Circles were next created by shuffling the board back and forth, or from side to side. Notice that all the dimensions of the formation, including the two pathways and the three Circles, are exponents of 16 feet, which would seem to support \"Captain Kirk's\" collective confession. But there is something a little too glib about the latter, too, or at least the shortened version as I have it. A few questions remain, and depending on their answers, the hoaxers were either extremely prescient and prepared, or unerringly lucky in their first noctur- nal (?) attempt at concocting a com- plicated 'pictogram' formation. Quick Complications For one thing, why the 67-degree angle between the two pathways at the outset? Admittedly, this could be a sim- ple artifact of the way \"things went down\" at the time of creation. On the other hand, it's curious enough to raise an eyebrow or two, too, not in terms of the actual angle degree itself, but in regards as to how the pathways themselves actually met their end Circles. If they met both satellite Circles at the same angle, and presumably at the Circle's \"midpoint,\" for example, then things become fair- ly complicated fairly quickly. In other words, how did the hoaxers know precisely where to position the centers of the two outlying Circles so that they would be connected to the original Circle by pathways of the same length? Certainly they need not have been worried by alignments that sur- faced later (and which, at any rate, were supplied by Haddington himself). But the problem may be trickier than it first appears. Say, for example, we've laid down a single 16-foot diameter Cir- cle according to the scheme outlined above. Now, using the only available \"ruler,\" the 16-foot long plank, how do you determine a distant center point for the second and third Circles? If you ex- tend the wooden plank from the outer perimeter of the first Circle, for in- stance, and then use that end point as the center of the next Circle, then ob- viously the result is adjoining Circles whose perimeters intersect one another. By way of a visual analogy, think of a Mickey Mouse cartoon in which the central Circle consists of the head and two adjacent Circles now constitute the ears. If you use your 16-foot plank to separate the distance between the Circles, however, all you've arrived at is a perimeter point, not the center point which is necessary for establishing the separate diameters of the second and third Circles. Furthermore, the latter two Circles need to be precisely posi- tioned in regard to the center point of the first Circle so that the resulting pathways equal 16 feet in length and presumably approach the two outer Circles at the same approximate angle. In other words, there is an informa- tion flow involved here which works automatically in one direction, but which involves at least a minimal amount of forethought and calculation in the other direction. Think back again to the original first Circle. Now if you go to its outer perimeter and plunk down your plank so that its far end lies 16 feet way, a Circle drawn using that point as its center will intersect the perimeter of the Circle you've just drawn by definition. A second plunk, or \"throw,\" of the plank along the same line, is required in order to determine the center of a Circle that will be separated from the first by a distance of 16 feet. And that Circle can only be 16 feet in diameter. A third throw is re- quired if the adjunct Circle is to be both 32 feet in diameter and separated from the first Circle by 16 feet of virgin, un- disturbed wheat. Am I making myself clear? No? Then you begin to appreciate some of the minimal difficulties in- volved with interpreting the Circles phenomenon itself in the absence of precise plans, maps and other relevant data. Both \"sides,\" in other words, are almost equally at blame for the present state of confusion and I, for one, somewhat resent being stranded be- tween two worlds and asked to choose allegiance on any other basis than the available data itself. The fundamental problem with cereology, and much of the same criticism could easily be extended to in- clude contemporary ufology, is that the original data is being hoarded and secreted away and only publicly disseminated as seen fit by opposing sides of the argument, both \"super- natural\" and scientific, and only in sup- port of their own prevailing point of view. H addington, for example, seems blissfully willing to accept any formation on face value, with- out so much as a backward glance at the possibility of a human hoax or mun- dane explanation, meteorological or otherwise. What this means in real world terms, though, is that having committed to the marvelous and mysterious point of view, the Earl of Haddington is no longer interested in garnering meteorological data as any field investigator should, whether rele- vant or not, because he himself is now obviously convinced that the latter can- not in any way apply to the phenom- MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 277 May 1991"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"enon at hand. Thus, for example, we have no way of knowing whether the pathways in the Scottish Circles pur- posefully point in the direction of the burial sites of 14th century knights or merely along the direction of the prevailing wind flow because no one on the 'supernatural side' of the equation is now willing to admit of any me- teorological correlation or influence whatsoever. If you don't think, a priori, that a cer- tain correlation appertains or even con- ceivably applies, then you certainly won't go looking for it. And by virtue of not finding what you are not look- ing for in the first place, you can only obviously conclude that your pre- existing world view is being reinforced at every turn. Meanwhile, potentially relevant data is consigned to the junk heap, not because it wasn't worth gathering at the time, but simply because it wasn't seen as worth gather- ing at all. In this particular case we can see that Haddington never once even considered the notion that wind flow, air tem- perature or frontal movements, never mind a human hoax, might have had anything remotely to do with what was found on the ground. Since we don't know the angle of prevailing wind cur- rents in the 'afflicted' area, for exam- ple, how do we know that the pathways, hoaxed or not, weren't aligned with isobars or not? This would be fairly easily obtainable information, too, one would think, were one so inclined. Instead, we are treated to information that is even more easily obtainable, and certainly more digesti- ble, when mixed with the overall aura of excitement the Circles inherently possess, namely the mythological land- scape and folklore of any area that can be found in almost any local library. If the Earl of Haddington indeed wants to inform himself and his readers about the Circles phenomenon, rather than regale both parties with cultural correlations that may or may not have anything to do with what's at hand, then it would behoove him and his to con- sider all avenues of approach, including the meteorological and human hoaxers, rather than face the prospect of having to consume a rather large facial om- elette later. I believe it was a Professor Schiller who once warned that \"Nothing is more likely to impede in- vestigation than premature 'explana- tion.' \" T he same could be said of some of his critics as well. Certainly as I have it, \"Captain Kirk's\" account of having confabulated these particular Scottish circles reeks almost as much of scotch as it does of reality. But isn't there an easy way out? With the promise of a few more pints couldn't Captain Kirk and crew be induced to replicate their infamous and presum- ably nocturnal escapade for all to see? The exercise, as I see it, would be both exciting and illuminating. We could finally find out the time frame under which human hoaxes could be per- petrated, and whether or not the latter can be convincingly distinguished and eliminated from the ongoing Circles data base by professional cereologists like the Earl of Haddington. If the local rowdies couldn't reproduce their clever performance of a fortnight or two ago, however, then we could also look upon their claims with some askance. Rather than trying to establish the paranormali- ty of some Circles, perhaps the Centre for Crop Circles Study should be try- ing to prove their normality, perhaps by hosting weekend contests with cash prizes for the best hoax? Publicity would accrue, and who knows, it might even turn out to be a fund-raiser of the first water. At the least it would let us know how easy it is to distinguish a manmade hoax from the real thing. As it is, we are usually told that the experts on the scene can readily tell the difference be- tween the two, but exactly how is never made clear. Most times, we're simply left to take the investigators' word for it, as if some sort of inherited sixth sense were at work. There must be a better way. Hoaxing an elaborate Cir- cle or two on our own would at least establish a few known benchmarks by which subsequent formations could be judged. Is it always true, for example, that a clever hoax breaks off seed pods and/or damages the existing stalks? Does it take \"hours\" to carve out a hoax, or can it be accomplished fairly rapidly, in a matter of minutes? Strange as it seems, hoaxers have even been filmed in the act with night-vision cameras; yet not one of the filmers, by all accounts, so much as considered the possibility that a mundane hoax — rather than something exceedingly strange and wonderful — was in pro- gress. No one went to investigate at the time. \"Translations\" What should be clear by now is that, unlike a good UFO case, Crop Circles are relatively easy to hoax, or at least easier to hoax, and that their numbers are likely to increase incrementally this coming summer, given the numbers of gullible investigators and tabloid media people likely to be on hand. For the rest of us to have even a vague idea of which formations are genuine and which are not, we need better guidelines than those of \"feel\" or intuition. This is especially true when it comes to \"interpreting,\" or \"translating,\" the complex \"pictogram\" formations, which is rapidly becoming a small cot- tage industry in its own right. Why an unknown \"non-human intelligence,\" ufonauts, or much of anything else, would want to spend its time carving complex patterns in cereal crops is just sort of blithely assumed on the basis that the patterns are simply too fun- damentally complex, on their face, to have sprung fullblown from nature, however complex or a prisoner of pat- terns the latter might be in other areas. Hurricanes are fairly complex systems, too, ones that have their origins hundreds and thousands of miles away from where they do their destruction, yet only a few fundamen- talists run around claiming that the sky is falling or that hurricanes are a \"warn- ing\" from above. Yet without fairly re- cent innovations in aerial and satellite photography, we would probably have no really good idea of just how com- plex the structure of an average hur- ricane or tornado really is.

Call for Abduction Cases In 1964 the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) issued a compendium of in- formation about UFOs called The UFO Evidence. This enormously influential and useful volume drew together the various aspects of sightings and witnesses into a systematic and power- ful testament to the reality of UFOs. It was used to educate congressmen and the public alike and it helped change the direction of UFO research. Now we have the opportunity to pro- ceed with a project that promises to be even more powerful and influential. Budd Hopkins and David Jacobs have been named project directors of a ma- jor effort to bring together into one volume the complexity and variety of the abduction phenomenon. The pro- ject calls for a compilation of abduc- tion cases from around the country in- vestigated by as many UFO and abduc- tion researchers as possible. It is hoped that new patterns will be identified, new questions can be asked, and new direc- tions for research can be developed. A compendium of this type can provide authoritative evidence of the reality of the phenomenon for UFO researchers, scientists, members of the therapeutic community and skeptics. Obviously this type of endeavor depends on the cooperation of the en- tire UFO research community. Without your help it cannot be done. Therefore I would like to make a special request to you. The project would like to publish the abduction cases that you have collected over the years. If your report is used, you will be given full credit in the compendium and your by- line will be on the case. In effect, this would be a refereed publication that can be added to your UFO resume. If you are planning a book on your case, and you want to have only a part of the case used, your wishes will be respected. This is a non-profit endeavor. Proceeds from the final publication will be used to further the study of UFO abductions. The time has come now to work together in a cooperative effort for the good of UFO research. It is only together that we can make substantial headway into deciphering the mysteries of this most important phenomenon. Both Budd Hopkins and David Jacobs will be contributing their cases and I feel sure that you will want to make your own contribution so that you can be a part of this historical undertaking. — Walter H. Andrus, Jr. Instructions The cases should be as complete as possible. Short fragments are accept- able, but we would prefer comprehen- sive cases. \"Multiple\" cases, in which abductees see others abducted, nonab- ductees see others abducted, or two or more people are abducted at once, are important for inclusion. Documentation should accompany reports. Names (or pseudonyms) along with the age, sex and pertinent infor- mation about the abductee, e.g., phy- sical infirmities, ethnic background, etc., should be sent. Include the time, place and date of the abduction. All names and addresses will be confiden- tial. It is also important to send sup- porting material like how the abductee first suspected that he/she was involved with the abduction phenomenon, where the abductee went for investigation and so on. If possible, please send a transcript of the hypnotic regression and/or non- hypnotically recalled interview. If it is not possible to provide a transcript, copies of audio and video tapes will be accepted. If a taped account is used, transcripts will be made by us and given to the investigator at the project's conclusion. Please include your name, address and phone number, along with infor- mation about your years of investigative experience and any other biographical data that you deem appropriate. If your cases are used, you will be asked to sign a release allowing us to publish them.

Jacobs Japanese UFO and Space Symposium The first International UFO and Space Symposium took place on November 23-25 of last year, in Hakui City on the west coast of Japan, several hundred miles from Tokyo. The sym- posium ran concurrently with a space exhibit which opened on November 17 and closed on the 25th. The UFO portion of the symposium was unique in that it was supported by both the local city and national govern- ments. Although Japan's Prime Minister, Toshiki Kaifu, did not attend in person, he did send a message read in his absence which said that he thought it was time to take the UFO problem seriously. The Governor of Ishikawa Prefecture, Yoichi Nakanishi, did attend, as did Mayor Kazuo Shiotani and the Hakui city council. Others who labored long and suc- cessfully so that the symposium could take place included Mr. Josen Takano, a name probably familiar to many American ufologists, ably assisted by Trudy Nodahara of Los Angeles, and a number of local helpers.

Widely advertised ahead of time, the UFO and space exhibits occupied several floors of the city's main cultural center. One floor, devoted to space exploration, was decorated with numerous displays of manmade spacecraft, from the early astronaut days to the moon landing. These in- cluded two actual moon rocks and a mock-up of a proposed moonbase. Another floor contained a large UFO photo exhibit featuring sightings from around the world. \"Space Girls\" in special uniforms served as guides. Nearly one thousand people attended the opening ceremonies. The Mayor welcomed the crowd while the speakers were presented with large bouquets of flowers presented by ladies dressed in beautiful traditional kimonos. Then the symposium split in two, the space half probably highlighted by Skylab 4 astronaut Dr. Gerald Carr, who ad- dressed over 15,000 school children in the first two days. The UFO portion of the symposium consisted of lectures, and a question and answer session directed at invited lifologists. Dr. Bruce Maccabee, Chair- man of the Fund for UFO Research and MUFON State Director for Maryland, represented the United States, as did Major Coleman Von Keviczky (Hun- garian Army, Ret.), a resident of New York and Director of ICUFON. The Soviet Union was represented by Dr. Vladimir Azhazha, director of the new- ly formed \"SoyuzUFOtsentr (Unified UFO Center), and by Dr. Marina Popovich, who holds over a hundred world records as a woman test pilot. She is also the wife of cosmonaut Pavel Popovich, head of the commission on Abnormal Atmospheric Phenomena. Representing Taiwan were Hong-Yung Chiang and Kai-Chi Chang. Finally, representing Japan, were Dr. Mikio Naganobu, a geophysicist, and Jun-ichi Yaoi. The latter should be familiar to many American ufologists, too. During the past decade, Mr. Yaoi has traveled ex- tensively in the USA, making UFO and environmental documentaries that have been widely and well received in his native Japan. Japanese Cases Dr. Maccabee opened the UFO lec- tures by discussing several cases, in- cluding three of special interest to Japanese citizens (Japan Airlines Flight 1628 of November 1986; the December 1978 New Zealand sightings; and the Hamazaki video case of July 1989). He also discussed the Roswell case re- search, pointing out that these sightings, and many others like them from throughout the world, demonstrate that UFOs are real. Now the major problem is to get the world to treat the subject seriously, as suggested by the Prime Minister. Mr. Von Keviczky addressed the in- formation contained in government documents available worldwide, and addressed his efforts to get the United Nations to recognize ufology as a legitimate subject of serious scientific inquiry. Dr. Popovich discussed a few Soviet sightings, but spent most of her time describing her activities as a pilot. Dr. Azhazha discussed several Soviet sightings and the official reaction to them, including the establishment last spring of a center to coordinate the more than one hundred small groups of scientists and civilians currently scat- tered throughout the country. Hong-yung Chiang presented a very interesting study he had performed of ancient (mainland) Chinese sightings. Reviewing the records of several dozen cities, dating back many hundreds of years, Chiang found numerous references to odd things seen in the sky. Kai-Chi Chang discussed sightings in Taiwan. Dr. Naganobu spoke about two sightings made from Japanese ships in the Pacific Ocean. He was an observer during one of the sightings. Finally, Mr. Yaoi surveyed several Japanese sightings, ufology in general and the sorry state of the environment throughout the world. His talk demonstrated that the study of UFOs often leads to a wider, more holistic view of world affairs than the limited earthbound perspective that normally prevails.

They said the objects had flashing lights, were \"baseball size,\" fluores- cent, and traveled at rapid speeds. \"They saw nothing other than ordinary celestial activity,\" said Col. John M. White, commanding officer of the 4602nd Air Intelligence Service Squadron at Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado Springs, Colorado. His men checked reports called in on six suc- cessive nights beginning on the first. Sgt. Gilbert Nelson, a member of the intelligence squadron, was sent to Pueblo to investigate. He reported observing six appearances of the ob- jects. \"They were dull, more or less fluorescent glows, faint but bright enough to see. Most of them were triangular in shape, but one was round and brighter than the rest.\" Nelson said the objects were visible for only five or six seconds at a time, so great was their speed. (The Star-Journal, Pueblo, CO, 5/4/56; The Free Press, Colorado Springs, CO, 5/12/56; The News Tribune, Tacoma, WA, 5/10/56) • In dead seriousness and with some reluctance, the Air Force confirmed an eerie tale of UFO sightings over Pratt, Kansas. Some two dozen people, in- cluding Ground Observer Corps members on duty in the observation post, saw the objects and were inter- viewed by Air Force officers. The ob- jects, described as resembling two saucers rim-to-rim, were seen three times the night of May 8-9. Four were \"flying in formation\" in the first inci- dent, at 8:30 p.m. A single disc was seen at 12:30 a.m., and two more at 1:30 a.m. (The News-Herald, Hutchin- son, KS, 5/27/56) • Four members of the Columbia, Tennessee, Ground Observer Corps spotted four UFOs at 4 p.m. on the 20th. Major Cecil Gullett, director of the post, said the filter center reported back to him that a radar check had been made of the area and the only thing that showed up on the radar screen was a jet that the Air Force had in the area \"looking around.\" The observers described the objects as being oval- shaped and resembling two plates put together rim-to-rim. After four minutes in the area, the objects disappeared. (The Herald, Columbia, TN, 5/30/56) • 1961 Skyquakes and UFOs plagued Long Beach, California on the 19th. Area residents reported two aerial explosions about 3 p.m., and the sighting of 12 shiny objects playing tag over the city at 3:50 p.m. At 4:30 p.m., three jet interceptors flying in forma- tion swept in from the ocean and the shiny objects \"just disappeared.\" Five minutes later, six of the objects reap- peared and continued their maneuver- ing before abruptly fading from sight at 4:45 p.m. (The Independent, Long Beach, CA, 5/20/61) • For 90 minutes in the early hours of the 20th, Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, was under observation by a strange round object, glowing orange- white, which maneuvered over the Drone (pilotless aircraft) Launching Site. During this time, the UFO was tracked by two Air Force radar stations. Its prolonged maneuvers were observed by members of the 4756th Air Police Squadron and the assistant to the base UFO officer. After attempted intercep- tions by a jet and a helicopter, the UFO climbed away from the base and disap- peared.

He was looking out the bedroom window and saw a white to bluish-white object \"for an estimated three to six minutes.\" It stopped twice in its slow, westerly course to pick up first four, then six \"very, very dim ob- jects.\" The larger UFO would brighten when picking up the smaller objects and then dim when the smaller objects were aboard, he said. Goldthorpe said the larger object accelerated at a \"fantastic rate of speed\" northward after the 10 smaller objects were aboard and after it changed its westerly course.

During the pre-dawn watch, Mrs. Grant said that at one time seven tiny specks of bright light appeared in the northeast moving rapidly toward the south. When reaching the large craft, the smaller ones appeared to circle around it, dip below it, and then three of them swooped under the hovering vehicle, went up over it and appeared MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 277 May 1991"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"to disappear into the top of the craft. Some time later the four pin points of light that had disappeared to the south appeared to return, fly under the larger object and then disappear into the top as did the three earlier ones. (The Pioneer, Madras, OR, 5/19/66) • A disc-shaped craft with a dome on top, \"as clear as seeing a Cadillac drift- ing by,\" was observed in bright daylight on the 21st by an experienced pilot and his passenger. At 3:15 p.m., William Powell, a chief pilot for Sears Roebuck on the east coast was flying north- northwest at 4500 feet, three miles from the Willow Grove Naval Air Station near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Ahead of him were four Navy jets split into groups of two. While watching the jets, Powell noticed a solid, bright con- figuration at his 11 o'clock position, ap- parently at his altitude. The weather was excellent and the disc stood out clearly. Moving from left to right, the craft approached one group of jets from the rear, then made a sharp turn and came directly toward Powell's plane at moderate speed. Passing within 300 feet, it was seen to be a disc with a glistening white dome on top. Powell estimated the UFO's diameter at 20 feet. The vehicle disappeared after passing the plane. (The UFO Investi- gator (NICAP), March/April 1967) • 1971 On the afternoon of the 16th, three teenagers, Mike, Bill and Dave, had set-up a campsite adjacent to a pond east of Fredericksburg, Virginia. Two of the high school students set about exploring the area. Mike re- mained behind with his German shepherd dog and began to walk away from the pond towards the other end of the field. \"I felt like something was following me and I turned around and there wasn't anything there. In a split second I turned around again and there was this huge object, just like it was floating.\" The craft, when first spotted by Mike, had been hovering almost directly above the high voltage power lines near the pond. It slowly began to move in his direction. Mike, shocked by what he had already seen, laid down in the high grass to avoid detection. The vehicle approached to within 100 feet of where he was hiding and began to descend. \"Legs came out under it and it bounced as it hit the ground,\" Mike recalled. \"I couldn't move, I was stun- ned. I kept watching it and finally a door came down. Finally I saw this man, he had long arms and everything. Finally he started walking ... he looked around. He had some type of object in his hand — I don't know what it was — like a little small box that was glowing. He looked at me, put his hands up and started coming at me. Finally I told my dog to 'sick em' and he went after him.\" The being turned around and in a stiff, bouncing fashion returned to his craft. The door of the vehicle closed \"and about 10 minutes later it just lifted off.\" Mike's compan- ions found him a few minutes later ly- ing down in the grass \"moaning\" and obviously frightened. All three quick- ly returned to their homes. • While Mike's experience went unreported outside of the immediate family, another incident that occurred in the vicinity of his home on the 18th received considerable attention, in- cluding an extensive police investiga- tion. That evening, two of Mike's sisters, Cathy, 18, and Susie, 14, were returning home from the house of a friend. They were driving up the fami- ly's long winding driveway when they became aware of a humming sound and red lights around them and apparently coming from above the car. Almost im- mediately, the car's engine stalled, the headlights went out and the car radio quit. They tried frantically to start the engine but it would not respond. Ac- cording to the girls, they could see a gigantic disc-shaped craft, glowing white with four red lights beneath it, hovering about 50 feet above their car. After about five minutes, the car finally did start and Cathy, the driver, raced up the driveway and the \"thing\" con- tinued to follow them. The sound of the car racing up the driveway, throwing rocks and pebbles in its frantic search for safety, attracted the attention of Mike, who was inside the house at the time. Mike stepped outside the front door of the house and observed his sister's car racing up the driveway with \"this gigantic disc- shaped craft following them\" When they arrived, Cathy jumped out of the car and ran to the house, while her younger sister remained inside the car, too terrified to move. The disc had followed the car up to the house and continued to hover above it while Mike and an older brother watched. Cathy, meanwhile, called her parents who were visiting nearby relatives. Before they arrived home, the vehicle moved away. (The UFO Investigator (NICAP), May 1972) I 1976 Huge chunks of earth weighing hundreds of pounds were mysteriously cut from the ground, moved intact, then arranged like giant pieces of a jigsaw puzzle in a remote Canadian farming region where glow- ing UFOs were reported. At least five people claim vivid, close-up UFO sightings. Others reported hearing strange beeping sounds in the night. But the most puzzling part of the mystery remains the holes in the ground. \"There has been no explanation for them,\" Police Constable Robert Bruce said. No tracks from excavation equipment have been found near any of the digs. And scientists are at a loss to identify a natural cause for the holes. Bruce investigated one case in which three triangular pieces of earth and grass, about eight inches thick and weighing up to 600 pounds each — like huge chunks of sod — were neatly cut from the ground and moved intact 16 to 21 feet from their original locations. One piece was 11 feet by seven feet by six feet along its three sides. The other two were seven feet by five feet by four feet. \"The sod was placed in the same triangular pattern as the holes and could have fit back into them like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle,\" Bruce said. The \"puzzle\" was discovered in a hayfield on a hilly, rocky farm near the hamlet of Cooper, 112 miles northeast of Toronto, Ontario. \"My son found the holes on Sunday, the ninth,\" said the farm's owner, 68-year-old Reginal Trot- ter. \"I'd been in the field the Friday before and there was nothing wrong MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 277 May 1991"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"then. I don't have any idea how it could have happened,\" Trotter said. \"I've lived on this farm all my life and I have never seen anything like that before.\" According to Trotter, no one could have gone into the field with excavation equipment without his knowledge. \"There's absolutely no way to get in there except to go right past my house. Any vehicle would have to go right through my yard,\" he said. Similar holes were also found on two other nearby farms. And in each case, the earth and grass were moved intact. \"One of the pieces I found must have weighed at least 600 pounds, and it was 30 feet from the hole,\" said farmer Glenn Rollins. \"There were no signs of machinery tracks,\" he added. Bob Reincke, a spokesman for Fiat-Allis in Milwaukee, a firm that manufactures construction equipment, said: \"I can't think of anything that would do that without leaving some kind of tread mark or track.\" He and other experts also agreed that no machinery they know of could move such large pieces without breaking them. Lightning was discounted by Dr. Frank C. Creed, a high voltage engineer and lightning expert employed by the Canadian government. \"When lightn- ing strikes, it's the equivalent of an ex- plosion. It would scatter the sod, not move it intact,\" he said. Dr. John Westgate, a geologist at the University of Toronto's Scarborough College, said \"I can't think of any natural process that could have done this.\" One of the most spectacular UFO sightings in the area was reported by Mrs. Pauline Dudgeon, who said she saw a brilliant object in the road near her home two miles south of Cooper. \"It was just a huge big thing sitting out there on the road...\" (Na- tional Enquirer, August 17, 1976, by Bob Pratt) • 1981 William Hummer, a middle- aged security guard in Danville, Penn- sylvania, was so intrigued by what he saw on the afternoon of the fourth that he couldn't help but tell others. But later he was sorry he did. \"You're marked as a looney as soon as you say something.\" He happened to glance up at the sky and spotted something, fair- ly high, but the sun was overhead and it was hard to see. Stepping into the shadows of the house, he got a better look. Then he got a pair of binoculars. When he looked up toward the sun, he saw what appeared to be a giant circular object with a dome on top. Small disc- shaped craft were being launched from the larger vehicle and they moved off in different directions in groups of three. While this was going on, a wispy material like cobwebs came floating down. \"This stuff was coming down con- tinuously,\" Hummer said. \"I went after some of it but it was like you wasn't touching anything. It just disappeared.\" It appeared that the silk-like strands were coming from the small disc- shaped craft. He said he and about six of his neighbors witnessed the objects. Hummer's sister, Marie, came home from work about 2:30 p.m. \"I could see silky-like cobwebs and they were in great big strands,\" Marie said. \"I watched that stuff flying around for a long time. I could also see these things like flying discs.\" (The Daily Item, Sun- bury, PA, 5/5/81; The Enquirer & News, Battle Creek, MI, 12/28/81) The UFO Press The UFO Silencers By Timothy Green Beckley, Introduction by John Keel Inner Light Publications, paperback, 160 pages, illus., $12.95 Reviewed by Dennis Stacy I f Timothy Green Beckley didn't already exist, ufology would prob- ably have to invent him all over again, a thought sure to send shivers down the spines of many. But he does exist, and in many ways he is his own best invention. He is, if nothing else, remarkably irrepressible. Others may dream about editing their own UFO magazine, of having their own pub- lishing platform, but Beckley simply goes out and does it, year after year after year. The results are not always on firm footing with facts, but why let little things like that get in the way of a rip-roarin' yarn? On occasion, public service is even performed, as with the publication in this country of Jenny Randies' Alien Abductions, also from Inner Light Publications, Box 753, New Brunswick, NJ 08903. The UFO Silencers, however, is pure unadulterated Beckley, from the garish cover art outside, to the equally garish contents inside, in this case an examina- tion of the myth and lore of the now in- famous Men in Black, or MIBs (Beck- ley even includes a photograph of one, or at least of someone in a dark suit). Form meets function, but the fault, dear reader, is hardly wholly Beckley's own, for nothing else about ufology is quite so garish or outlandish as the tales told of mysterious MIBs, those shad- owy strangers who drive black Cad- illacs and supposedly spy on UFO in- vestigators and witnesses, pilfering pic- tures and other evidential data, while posing as low level bureaucrats straight out of Monty Python's Ministry of Strange Walks. Nothing funny about this latest crop of Kafkaesque kids, though, in fact, far from it. Beckley's dark visitors strike terror into the hearts of men (and women) everywhere. Occasionally, they even cut loose with a machine-gun. But mostly, they just hang around and make a nuisance of themselves, exuding a sense of dread and otherworldliness. For all their assumed nefariousness, in- stances of actual alleged damage to per- sons and property seem relatively few and far between, hardly the results one would expect of sinister supernatural CIA or KGB agents. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 277 May 1991"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Beckley traces such stories back to medieval times and themes, but psychological and psychosocial com- mentary are not the author's strongest points. Nor is he fabricating these tales out of whole cloth, either. Although Beckley rarely meets a footnote or reference he likes, unless it happens to have an address and a dollar sign in it, he is, after all, only reporting what others have told him or written. Typ- cially, but not always, these others are a \"reliable\" or \"well-known\" UFO in- vestigator who no one else has ever relied on or heard of. But if verifiable facts aren't allowed to get in the way of a good yarn, why should reliable sources fare any better? If abducting Grays and Nords are believable, why not MIBs? Black Choppers The latter category, in fact, has taken on a new twist with the advent of the black helicopter, which seems to be well on the way to replacing the worn- out dark sedans of the early days of ufology. Whether this represents a psychological undercurrent of fear of modern technology, or merely an in- crease in the MIB's black budget, Beckley fails to note. Such stories con- tinue to surface in the serious literature, however, most recently in personal Epilogue of Ed Conroy's Report of Communion, and once started, they burn like grass fires, tenaciously and almost impossible to put out. Few seem to notice or care that once you start being aware of black helicopters, the more black helicopters there are to be aware of. Flying back to San Antonio not too long ago, for ex- ample, I glanced out of the window in time to see a shiny, new black helicopter on the ground in front of a small hangar, its rotar blades slowly turning. Curiously, the chopper bore no obvious markings. Equally curious, perhaps, my inflight reading had been Conroy's Report. Now, was it a mere coincidence of perception on my part, or an act of persecution or surveillance on the part of the MIB? Your choice not only reveals a good deal about how you think about UFOs, but also about how like- ly (and possibly even entertaining) you're apt to find The UFO Silencers. The author stirs in all sorts of discon- nected bits and chunks before the book not so much concludes, as simply ends with the last episode. As documenta- tion of the MIB phenomenon itself, or as an attempt to analyze what, if anything, it might mean, Silencers is fairly thin gruel. But both as source and example of the ongoing diaspora of rumor, myth, folklore and paranoia within the UFO community, it repre- sents a thick, chunky stew. And of course as the latest chapter in Beckley's own lifelong biography, it comes with its own collector's item status built-in. Not bad for thirteen dollars in today's market. Of Wolves And Aliens THE WILD By Whitley Strieber Tom Doherty Associates, NY, paperback, 378 pp, $5.95 Review by Robert J. Durant W hitley Strieber is by far the best known abductee. His Communion was on the best- seller charts for six months, and the se- quel, Transformation, also sold very well. Fans of horror fiction made him a star in that field long before Commu- nion appeared. Now Strieber has pro- duced a new book, The Wild, which I picked up in the supermarket, a certain signal that he has become a genuine mass media fixture. On the surface, the book has nothing to do with abductees or ufos. It is in- stead a return to his bread and butter horror fiction, and once again deals with a favorite Strieber theme — sen- tient, almost supernaturally powerful wolves. And like his previous horror fiction, this one is gripping and hard to put down. But the book is worth reading on a deeper level, too, as part of the search for the \"real\" Whitley Strieber and the true nature of his bewildering abduc- tion experiences. The central figures are Bob Duke, a man given to poetry but a failure in the practical world of business, his wife Cindy, and their 12-year-old son, Kevin. Prior to embarking on a career as a writer, Strieber worked in adver- tising, apparently with indifferent results. The rest of the description of the Duke family is plainly true to life, a thinly veiled biographical sketch, in- cluding the Greenwich Village apart- ment, the Ulster County cabin, and much else of both a concrete and per- sonal nature that Strieber-watchers have picked up in one place or another over the years about Whitley, Anne and An- drew Strieber. One day Bob Duke turns into a wolf, abruptly metamorphosing right in front of his family. This absurd, impossible event launches the story. The fact that Strieber makes everything following the metamorphosis perfectly logical, and indeed fascinating, is a tribute to his skill as a writer. But the book is far more than just a horror thriller. The nature of a universe that can permit sudden dramatic upheavals in the laws of physics and in everything that we thought was \"true\" and \"right\" is repeatedly questioned in the text. It quickly becomes obvious that Strieber has used the metamor- phosis as a metaphor for the nearly equally absurd and impossible abduc- tion experience. Yet, he is telling us, through the cleverly contrived medium of a man-to-wolf story, it happened. And the event demands explanation. A consistent theme of profound puzzlement and distress runs through Strieber's formal and informal com- mentaries on his dealings with the aliens. Lately he has turned his back on ufologists, denouncing them as useless at best in the quest for mean- MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 277 May 1991"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"ingful interpretation of the abduction experience. Like most abductees, he feels abandoned by his own civilization. Neither science nor religion has pro- vided answers or solace: \"He has no way of explaining himself, not even in his own mind. His only thought was that ours is an age at the far limit of time, and it is at limits and extremes that the impossible can happen. Or maybe the mysterious fifth force that physicists speculate about had something to do with it. Maybe it was a disease, psy- chological or otherwise.'' The wolf that had been Duke/Strie- ber enters the world of unadulterated nature, where higher and more univer- sal laws beyond our ken control ex- istence. His wife and child metamor- phose and join him in the new life, clos- ing the personal ring. Our human culture is left far behind without regret. It is troubling to watch an acute in- tellect such as Strieber's struggle helplessly in the face of \"the phenom- enon.\" Even more unsettling is the pic- ture of a man of truly refined instincts and immense erudition embracing wolves, primeval enemies and com- petitors of man, as models for both the aliens and a regenerated (Transformed?) mankind. U fologists can propound con- vincing arguments for the re- ality of extraterrestrial visita- tion. But for them the subject remains abstract and sterile, an armchair exer- cise, and that is something that enrages abductees, for whom the experience is overwhelmingly real and personal: \"What eats us? We can't understand it any more than the chicken can under- stand Frank Perdue. There is something out there.\" In addition to his wife and son, the metamorphosis was witnessed by Mon- ica, a psychiatrist and friend of the family: \"The woman was slowly com- ing undone, tortured by her inability to understand what had happened to Bob, and unable to enlist the aid of any of her fellow scientists and doctors in her research. Monica was now a haunted woman, her practice in ruins, her wealth disappearing into the well of what the rest of her profession saw as an insane quest.\" Sounds painfully familiar. Like \"Bob\" and \"Cindy\" and \"Kevin,\" Monica is a figure based on a very real person. Indeed, most of us who toil in this perplexing field of ufology can sigh agreement with this description. Aren't we all, researchers and abductees alike, victims? And in a passage reminiscent of his writing in Communion on the social nature of the aliens, Strieber speaks thus of the \"wolves\": \"How could anybody have ever thought that these were simple beasts? Bob was faced with the shocking realization that the wolves had evolved an intelligence and a sense so great that it was literally incom- parable, and yet so different from man's intelligence that it was all but invisible to the human mind.'' We suppose that the alien intelligence laughs at us, carrying on a sort of cosmic Keystone Kops routine that makes hilarious sense to them, but leaves our pythagorean sensibilities stupefied. One is reminded of the ex- traordinary elaborations of last year's Crop Circles. Surely this is an in- telligence at work, and surely some- thing like communication is the pur- pose. And there is a delicious irony in the use of cereal crops as the medium of communication, the same cereal agriculture that founded our human civilization. Dr. David Jacobs, a leading abduc- tion researcher, once told me that the common denominator of abduction ex- periences is what he called \"the stare.\" That is, the experience begins with the onset of what we would call hypnotic trance, and the trance is produced by a steady gaze from the awesome eyes of the aliens. In the final pages of The Wild, Cin- dy has been metamorphosed and the son, Kevin, is being asked to join his parents, completing the family transi- tion to the new world. A native American Indian has accompanied Cin- dy and Kevin, providing guidance from the rich store of his race's mysticism. Cindy, now a wolf, is standing with her paws on Kevin's shoulders, looking into his eyes: \"They do it to you,\" the In- dian shouted.

Dear Editor: Larry Bryant, a civilian writer for the Pentagon, has seen his lawsuit against the Secretary of Defense et al, finally come to an end. That suit, filed in the mid '80's, claimed an abuse of his constitutional- ly protected right of speech and press. As most know, Bryant's exemplary per- formance ratings plummeted (jeopar- dizing his career) when he refused to cease placing his \"UFO Whistle- blower\" ads in military base papers. The suit sought to prevent Base Com- manders from arbitrarily refusing to allow publishers to place Bryant's ads and to restrain his supervisors from fur- ther harassment. The Government agreed with Bryant on his claim of prior restraint and stipulated it would not recur. Those ads continue to be pub- lished. Bryant lost on his harassment claim, however, the reasons buried in legal esoterica. My reason for this letter is to thank Bryant as a U.S. citizen and ufologist.

I mean it when I say you have the stuff of which constitutional heroes are made. I'm very proud to know and have represented you.\" — Robert H. Bletchman Manchester, CT Dear Editor: The letter from Hilary Evans in the January 1991 Journal promotes Dr. Meaden's \"Plasma Vortex\" theory of Crop Circle formation as \"the best ap- proach — because it is the only scien- tific approach.\" I doubt that Mr. Evans, if he is a scientist, can have studied Meaden's theory for there is little that is scientific about it. Those who have read Meaden's book, The Circles Effect and Its Mysteries, will know that he ascribes the origin of his vortices to the lee effect of hills, which divide the airflow of the geostrophic wind: \"Something energetic takes place to disturb the relative tranquillity of the dynamic stability of the spinning col- umn or trailing vortex and forces a component of its energy, probably con- centrated into a small volume, to follow a path that eventually leads to self- destruction at the ground or in the air.\" Something energetic indeed! If we are to accept this line of reasoning, we must abandon the Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum, which physicists have never previously queried. Circles frequently form on completely still nights when the at- mosphere is extremely stable; so, from tiny initial velocities, Dr. Meaden would have us believe, localized speeds of over 200 km/hr or so, needed to flat- ten crops, spontaneously develop. Nowhere does his book suggest any rotational velocities for these mythical vortices or offer any equations to show how they form and act. His vortices are something quite different from whirlwinds and dust-devils since these are produced by separate (understood) processes and are ascending vortices, rather than ones that press down on the ground. And somehow Dr. Meaden's vortices, without any lateral movement, miraculously disperse leaving geo- metric patterns with sharply defined edges! Having abandoned one well estab- lished law, Meaden then has no qualms about jettisoning another. His vortex, which has sprung energetically from nowhere, can assume, he says, an \"in- ternal structure\" which is highly organized: observe for example the pat- tern, supposedly produced by a \"plasma vortex,\" which formed the Alton Barnes pictogram shown on the cover of the December Journal. He ig- nores the fact that such a process would contravene the well established Second Law of Thermodynamics, which states that entropy (a measure of the pro- bability of degree of disorder) of a system either remains constant or increases. If disregard for the established laws of physics were insufficient reason for rejecting Meaden's theory, its other glaring failure is that it simply does not account for the facts. There is no ex- planation for the vast increase in the numbers of Circles, the increasing com- plexity of the patterns and the occa- sional precise \"revisitation\" of the ex- isting formations, all of which are now beyond doubt. In the past Meaden has denied that any of this was even hap- pening! Anyone with scientific training, who is aware of the facts, has to discard Meaden's theory and think again. Most Circles researchers rejected it long ago. Dogmatic insistence that the Circles are a natural phenomenon and are not produced by a intelligence, is what has lead to the tacit acceptance by some people of this very unscientific theory. Few would deny that some kind of energy (whether intelligently directed or not) produces the Circles. If we lack scientific instruments at present which are able to record and explain this energy, are we to say that it doesn't ex- ist and settle for explanations which are clearly at variance with the facts? Finally, what I labelled \"stupid\" was the statement by Randies and Fuller that \"UFO research in its own right is now dead and has become part of meteorology.\" Perhaps, with the per- mission of the Editor of the Journal, I could canvas readers' views on this issue? — George Wingfield Director of Field Research Center for Crop Circle Studies Somerset, UK MUFONET-BBS Network Electronic Bulletin Board 8-N-l 300-14,400 Baud 901-785-4943 Have a Viewpoint to Express?
