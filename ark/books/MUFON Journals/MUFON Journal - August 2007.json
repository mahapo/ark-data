I had also attended the 50 th anniversary celebration in 1997 so it was nostalgic to be back. The International UFO Museum was larger than I remembered it and I was very impressed by the museum library’s extensive collection of UFO related books and periodicals. What really struck me was the sense of UFO history that Roswell evoked and it made me stop and ask myself whether we are any closer to understanding the UFO phenomenon after 60 years of investigation and research. As J. Allen Hynek once said, we suffer from an “embarrass- ment of riches”—that is, we have an enormous amount of collected UFO data, but what are we to make of it? MUFON is proud to announce that we have formed two research teams that will be actively looking at that data: the UFO History team and the Alien Abduction research team. Please stay tuned to the Journal for updates on team activities. When I got back from Roswell, I decided to spend some time going through the Edward Ruppelt files which MUFON now has in its posses- sion for scanning as part of the Pandora Project. Reading original correspondence between Ruppelt and other well known figures of the time in both the UFO and scientific and military communities evoked the same feelings of awe and inspiration that I felt being in Roswell.

Eight years of scientific testing strongly suggest that an ancient skull found in Mexico nearly eight decades ago is something other than entirely human. In fact, the skull known as the “Starchild” might well prove to be the first biological relic confirmed by DNA testing to be a human-alien hybrid. This remarkable skull is now on the verge of making history as large as history can be made. How it came to be in that improbable position is re- vealed in a new book, The Starchild Skull – Genetic Enigma or Human- Alien Hybrid? , which recounts my eight years of dragging the skull from expert to expert, seeking those with enough intellectual curiosity to take it seriously and to apply rigorous scien- tific testing to it, and then have the courage to put their names to their results. It hasn’t been easy. What follows is an abbreviated outline of the events detailed in the book. 1930 1930 1930 1930 1930 . In the baking high desert of northern Mexico, in a nondescript village in the general area of the Copper Canyon, a teenaged American girl arrived with her family to visit the home from which her parents had emigrated twenty years earlier. She was told to avoid the caves and aban- doned mine tunnels in the area because they were dangerous. As soon as she could, she went after the forbidden fruit, and eventually ended up in a mine tunnel. In that tunnel she found a human skeleton lying supine on the floor. Closer inspection revealed that a bony, “misshapen” hand emerged from a mound of dirt beside the skeleton, and was wrapped around one of its upper arm bones. Assuming a whole skeleton might be buried under the dirt, the girl dug with her hands to reveal a “smaller, totally misshapen” skeleton. The girl tried to recover every bone of both skeletons, assuming she could find a way to carry them back into the U.S. without her parents or siblings finding out about it. She hid them under a tree, but unfortu- nately a torrential downpour washed all the bones away—except the two skulls (minus their mandibles) and a broken piece of maxilla from the misshapen one. As the girl grew up and entered her adult years, she varnished the skulls and put them in a cardboard box, keeping them as ghoulish souvenirs from her first sojourn in Mexico. And so they stayed until her impending death in the early 1990s, when she passed them to friends in her home- town of El Paso, Texas. Those friends eventually passed them to another couple, Ray and Melanie Young, who had a unique skill-set for evaluating what until then was assumed by its owners to be a “genetic deformity.” 1998 1998 1998 1998 1998. For several years Melanie Young was a neonatal nurse dealing with all forms of human deformity. From the moment she first held the weird skull in her hands, she felt it wasn’t a “normal” human deformity. It was too light by far, weighing half of what a normal human skull that size should weigh, and it was entirely too symmetrical. Normal human deformity is anything but symmetrical. This skull was more symmetrical than a typical human, so she strongly suspected it might be something else. But what? As it happened, Melanie and Ray were members of the El Paso chapter of MUFON, the Mutual UFO Net- work. In consultation with a friend there, they had to admit it looked much like the shape and size of a skull that would fit perfectly inside the head of a stereotype “Grey” alien. After agreeing on that, they decided to have the skull scientifically tested to establish its genetic heritage conclusively. They contacted me and asked if I would undertake the task of bringing it to appropriate experts to determine what it might be, and, if that seemed to warrant more detailed analysis, then such analysis would be arranged and carried out. It seemed simple enough. It was anything but. 1999 1999 1999 1999 1999. The first scientific test of the skull was a radiographic X-ray analysis carried out in Las Vegas, Nevada. The weird skull’s bone was shown to be uniformly thin throughout, rather than exhibiting the usual thinness in areas of deformity while being otherwise normal. Also, no sign of frontal sinuses were visible, not even vestigial buds. This was considered highly unusual. The most striking result, however, was that the associated piece Left: A “Grey” alien as depicted on the cover of Whitley Strieber’s “Communion.” Right: Artist Rob Roy Menzies’ reconstruction of the adult Starchild, shown with the typi- cally all-black alien eyes.

Based on that seem- ingly solid piece of evidence about it, we named it “the Starchild.” Next came analysis by a pair of anthropologists at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. (They are among the few experts not identified in the book, by either their own request to go unnamed, or my decision not to reveal names if that only served to make them look bad. I believe they all were doing their jobs—rightly or wrongly—as they felt they needed to do them.) These two specialists felt the skull was the result of hydrocephaly to explain the extraordinary bulge of the upper rear parietals, combined with the effect of cradleboarding in infancy to explain the extreme flattening at the rear of the head. However, at that point I knew hydrocephaly would not leave the noticeable crease along the saggital suture separating the two expanded parietals, and I also knew cradleboarding flattened only a small area from inion to crown on a normal human, and the flattening was as flat as the board an infant’s head would be strapped to as its mother did her work. The skull found with the Starchild exhibited this common flattening, but the Starchild did not. Its flattened area was three or four times as great, and its natural convolutions were clearly visible. It had grown into its shape because its genes directed it to do so, and if that were true, then those genes could not be entirely human. My initial perception of the strange skull was that it was, in all likelihood, a bizarre deformity of some kind. For it to be otherwise—for it to be alien or an alien-human hybrid falling into my hands—would be equivalent to the Dead Sea Scrolls falling into the hands of the goat herder. But I was beginning to suspect that maybe such lightning had struck again. Denver Denver Denver Denver Denver. The turning point for me came in Denver, Colorado, when a brain specialist made a number of startling discoveries about the Starchild’s brain. (This doctor made a specific request that I not name him.) First, its capacity was astounding. Normal human adult craniums contain an average of 1400 cubic centimeters of brain matter. A small-stature adult or a child of about twelve—which was the Starchild’s size—would have a brain in the range of 1200 cc. The Starchild had a brain volume of 1600 cc, which baffled the specialist. Even considering the extreme shallowness of the eye orbits, the missing frontal sinuses, and the expansion of the parietals, he could not account for an Far Left: Insert showing the position of human frontal sinuses; Left: Frontal view X- ray of SFWS (showing normal sinuses).

He also found that the steep rear angle of the brain pressing down on the foramen magnum—the opening where the spine entered the cra- nium—made it unlikely that the cerebellum could have maintained its proper position at the base of the cerebrum. In addition to its steeply canted angle (visible in several of"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"      5 MUFON UFO Journal August 2007 The Starchild, Continued from page 4 Continued on page 6 many photos at w ww .starchildproject. com), the inner support structure of bone flanges (the saggital sulcus and transverse sulcus) was so reduced as to be ineffective as a support mecha- nism for the cerebellum. The expert could only conclude that the Starchild’s brain was made of some- thing denser than normal human brain matter, or it didn’t have a cerebellum in the way human cerebellums are understood. Either conclusion was enough to bolster my growing suspi- cion that the Starchild was not entirely human. Lincoln. Lincoln. Lincoln. Lincoln. Lincoln. In Lincoln, Nebraska, an ophthalmologist surgeon named Fred Mausolf studied the Starchild’s ex- traordinarily shallow eye sockets. He found them to be unlike normal human eye sockets in virtually every way. The foramen openings for both the optic nerves and the associated nerves and blood vessels needed to make a human eyeball function properly were skewed down and inside to the middle part of the nose, which would have put the Starchild’s eyeballs— assuming it had eyeballs— well below where human eyes normally were positioned. Also, their inner surface areas, while astonishingly shallow, were symmetrical to an equally astonishing degree. This expert could not imagine how those eye sockets—as bizarre as they were—could be the result of defor- mity. Again, the Starchild’s genes seemed to have told them to grow that way, and if that were true, I could only conclude that they weren’t normal human genes. New Orleans New Orleans New Orleans New Orleans New Orleans. In my home city of New Orleans, Louisiana, Dr. Joseph Smith, a chief radiologist at a children’s hospital, arranged a CAT scan that estab- lished none of the Starchild’s cranial sutures were fused in any way. He ruled out defor- mity as a result of cranial suture fusion—espe- cially the crease in the saggital suture between the expanded parietals. Also, inexpli- cably, the Starchild’s inner ears were shown to be on the order of twice normal size and, once again, perfectly symmetrical. Then Carbon 14 analysis showed that death for both skulls had occurred 900 years ago, plus or minus 40 years. 2003 2003 2003 2003 2003. The Holy Grail of biologi- cal testing, DNA analysis, was carried out by Trace Genetics in the summer of 2003 using equipment at the Uni- versity of California at Davis. Re- searchers Jason Eshleman and Ripan Malhi found that burial in a mine tunnel for 900 years was like preserv- ing both skulls in a climate-controlled storage locker. The human skull produced an easy recovery of its mitochondrial DNA, showing it was from a common haplogroup for Mesoamericans, haplogroup A. Its nuclear DNA was also recovered easily, showing it was a female. One down, one to go. The Starchild’s mitochondrial DNA—inherited from and passed along only the female line—was recovered as easily as its companion’s, and proved to be of a separate Mesoamerican haplogroup, haplogroup C. This meant that even though their relationship was such that the female appeared to bury the Starchild and then laid down beside it to die (most likely by suicide), they were not, as we had assumed, a mother and child. That left us with only the definitive test to complete: What about the Starchild’s nuclear DNA, which would reveal the genetic heritage of both of its par- ents? Right out of the box there was a problem. Relative to a normal human, the Starchild’s bone had proved extremely difficult to cut, even though it was half as thick and half as heavy as normal human bone. Then, when Jason and Ripan put it into normal solvents for dissolving human bone, it resisted those routine attempts to break it down. Ultimately, a very powerful solvent had to be adminis- tered to get the bone into a condition to be tested, after which six attempts brought no recovery at all—not even a trace of nuclear DNA.

In the first place, if the Starchild’s bone was from a normal human, normal solvents should have easily dissolved it. Sec- ondly, after 900 years in optimum preservation conditions, the small degree of degradation in the bone should have made it easy to recover its nuclear DNA, as was the case with the female’s. And why was it that only the Starchild’s nuclear DNA resisted recovery, not its mitochondrial DNA? There was only one plausible answer: something was “wrong” with its father’s DNA . Somehow Dad’s contribution to the Starchild’s genetic package had produced a genome that would not respond to the chemical primers used to recover segments of human nuclear DNA. What could be done about this frustrating technical stalemate? Ac- cording to Jason and Ripan, nothing, at least not in the short term. They told me that in 3 to 5 years they expected the headlong rush of their field’s tech- nical improvements to create an atmo- sphere in which problems like ours with the Starchild would be resolved. So what, I asked them, could I do now? “Get the bone’s biochemistry tested,” they told me. They wanted an explana- tion why it had been so difficult to cut when they removed their samples. London London London London London. I spent all of 2004 in London getting as many tests done as we could manage with our time and resources. One of the first things we did was arrange an analysis by the scanning electron microscope at the Royal Holloway Scientific Institute outside London. It revealed something utterly astonishing: embedded in the matrix of the Starchild’s bone were fibers of some kind, fibers which seemed to be incredibly durable be- cause they had been shredded rather than sheared by the cutting blade that removed the bone samples from the skulls. Such fibers had never been found in any other bone in any other animal species on earth, so this was yet another blinking red neon sign that the Starchild skull represented something extraordinary. Later, forensic geologist Dr. Ken Pye (no relation to me) discovered at his laboratory outside London that a red residue of some kind was scattered in the Starchild’s cancellous holes. Normally upon death, corpses activate a wide array of internal bacteria that scour every vestige of marrow from the cancellous holes in every bone, leaving them, in effect, sparkling clean. So the residue discovered in the Starchild’s cancellous holes was something else not found in any other bone in any known species on earth. Certainly not in human bone, so it was more evidence of the Starchild’s uniqueness. 2006 2006 2006 2006 2006. In the summer of 2006, three years exactly since discovering that the Starchild’s nuclear DNA could not be recovered by the current tech- nology, and precisely when Jason and Ripan predicted a breakthrough might occur, the breakthrough did occur. But it was not in the sensitivity of the primers used to recover DNA, as was expected. It was much, much better than that. It was a new technique that did away with primers entirely! 454 Life Sciences of Branford, Connecticut, announced that it had found a way of sequencing DNA in a base-pair by base-pair arrangement, bringing all 3.0 billion base pairs in an average human genome within eventual reach of their sequencing machines. This was astounding news, but even more astounding was that it was already being applied to sequencing the elusive nuclear DNA of Neanderthals. Experts around the world were already hard at work on it, having sequenced the first few million base pairs, and they expected to complete the entire Neanderthal genome by the end of 2008. While this was extremely welcome news in its own right, what flew under the radar was that this same technol- ogy could be applied to recover the entire genome of the Starchild! It meant we can now sequence every gene in every chromosome contributed by its human mother and its father, whatever he was. We will be able to recover its genome and—just as others will do with the Neanderthal genome in 2008—we will be able to compare the Starchild’s father’s DNA, gene by gene, with those of normal humans to precisely determine how far or near he was relative to the human norms. That glorious day is now expected to be sometime in 2010. It could be as early as 2009, but the best guess now is The Starchild Continued from page 5 Continued on page 7 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images of SC bone.

Inasmuch as we have already endured eight years of this interminable wait, two years more does not seem so daunting. In fact, as I have started to say when asked, I think that after what I’ve been through in the preced- ing eight years, I can do two more standing on my head in a deep mud puddle. Today Today Today Today Today. Upside down or upright, we can settle into the two-year wait secure in knowing every indication of numerous conclusive scientific tests strongly suggests that we will ulti- mately prove beyond any reasonable doubt that the Starchild skull belonged to a being who was a product of mating—whether natural or in vitro— between a human mother and a father who was surely something other than entirely human. But will that make him an “alien” in the extraterrestrial sense of the word? As with Neanderthals, it will depend on where his genome falls in The Starchild Continued from page 6 nuDNA results for SFWS (left) and SC (right). Ladder-like track at far left of both sheets is the geneticist’s DNA to act as a control and prove the gel sheet is functioning properly. SFWS produces a clear, ladder-like track of nuDNA on far right of left sheet, revealing a normal female human. SC shows only primer-dimer (a different kind of control agent—not a result) in six attempts. If the Starchild’s father was human, another ladder-like track should be seen. Photo and Video Analysis in the Electronic Age The Scientific Method vs. Psuedo-science Continuing the excerpt of Jeff Sainio’s talk about The Scientific Connections in Photo/Video Ufology, which was presented at the 2002 MUFON Symposium. Investigating a Typical Case Occam’s Razor says that, given several explanations for a phenomenon, the simplest explanation is probably the correct one. Few people will believe a photo shows a flying saucer, when it could be a bug on a window. Here, the first four steps of the scientific method, ending in comparison of the UFO and conventional objects by simple visual methods, gets nowhere. This case is in the most frustrating category: ambigu- ous. Many cases have simply too little data for a conclusion. This doesn’t mean the case should be shelved. If, luckily, other tourists saw a disk at the time of the photo, the picture would be much more interesting. A digital camera is capable of good quality. (In digital images, defects are usually repeatable; in film, defects are usually random errors in manufacturing or developing.) A major problem is determining object distance. One must remember that a photo or video is merely a 2- dimensional representation of 3-dimen- sional space. The third dimension, distance, is not instantly obvious. Many “analysts” assume that “close objects on film are close objects in reality” and misrecognize a bug 10 feet away for a huge object thousands of feet away, simply because other “nearby” objects are that distance away. As da Vinci said, “paint five times bluer, the mountain that is five times distant.” Distant hilltops have successively poorer contrast. Assumptions must be made about the unknown object; a blue UFO would give poor contrast against the sky; but typically, an airborne object will be bright on top, and dark on the bottom, due to sky illumination. So matching the UFO contrast against earthly object contrast, can give a rough indication of distance. Continued on page 8 relation to normal humans. Will it be fractionally different, or as much as 1%? Or how about 2%? Or 3%? Certainly that would make him as alien as E.T., and the Starchild’s incredibly different physiology and morphology certainly points in that direction. All we have to do is be patient, lay our bets, and wait. Lloyd Pye is a writer/lecturer who has researched various aspects of alternative knowledge for the past thirty years. He has been the caretaker of the Starchild skull for the past eight years.

His previous bestseller, Everything You Know Is Wrong, will be available in an updated new edition in October."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"August 2007 8 MUFON UFO Journal Continued on page 9 UFOs on Videotape However, most UFO cases are now on videotape. Compared to either film or digital photos, video has: 1. Much worse resolution. This prevents all but the most basic focus tests, since the edges of objects are so poorly defined. 2. Much better sensitivity. Nighttime photos are rarely successful, while nighttime video can often record the Pleiades, a fairly dim star cluster. This sensitivity is typically at the expense of noise levels. Although both film and video “encode” color in ways that can cause distortion, video color is even less reliable than film. 3. Motion. Rarely is a UFO determined to be anomalous by its shape. Instead, speed, acceleration, sudden turns, or silent hovering, are the defining characteristics. Motion is created by a sequence of pictures, creating a huge amount of data. Analysis is best automated for the determination of UFO position, angle, contrast, etc. This not only relieves the tedium, but also eliminates any human bias. Unlike a series of photos, the timing of video images is known, allowing angular motion determination. While cameras usually have unknown autoexposure times, the exposure time of a camcorder can often be determined when, for example, a bright light is seen, and the camera moves quickly. The needed combination is usually available in a video. Motion gives a wealth of data. When people ask me what type of camera to carry in case a UFO is seen, my answer is “any analog camcorder.” As of this writing, the digital camcorders I’ve seen sacrifice too much quality for more recording time, to provide video usable for analysis. Determining which cases to investigate Science provides a rigorous method of reaching the truth. However, those dedicated to reaching that truth find themselves looking for the needle of knowledge in the haystack of misidentifications, insufficient informa- tion, and dead ends. Budgeting one’s time is essential in determining which cases are worth investigating. With that in mind, I will end by sharing some guidelines, with experience more than science as a basis, to aid in determining how to budget one’s time: 1. The love of money is the root of all evil UFO cases. If money is a high priority to a witness, truth is probably a low priority. (Some “witnesses” have offered me 10% of their sales!) If money is a high priority to a re- searcher, doubt the researcher’s validity. 2. Sincere witnesses don’t want public- ity. They want to know what they saw, or if the evidence can show they weren’t crazy. A witness who wants publicity probably wants quick sales more than the truth. 3. Many people think UFO reports come from wackos. Yes, rarely. The average psychotic is too disorganized to submit a report. Paranoids are an exception. Their ranting testimony usually makes them obvious before even looking at the evidence, and the evidence is usually of a cloud or contrail whose sinister nature is apparent only to them. 4. It’s normal for a sincere witness to exhibit hypersensitivity after a sighting. Seeing an extraordinary object is a challenge to one’s mindset, and a sudden interest in learning or seeing more is to be expected. Misidentifications often follow. 5. UFO sightings appear to be rare, random events. Unless there is evi- dence of nonrandom UFO interaction with a particular person (abductee syndrome), a witness claiming to have many sightings, probably does... of misidentifications. My record is a videotape of 44 different UFO sightings; it contained every angle of airplane views. One portion showed the full set of standard airplane lighting, and the airplane engine noise on the soundtrack. 6. In view of the above fact, going out UFO hunting is usually a waste of time, absent any evidence of actual UFO activity at the time. However, UFO hunters WILL return with evidence... of misidentifications. My only two submissions of automobile headlights, were from UFO hunters; in one, the audio track declares the event a “significant alien interaction.” I’ve never seen a UFO, except in my mailbox. All these reports were from witnesses or researchers who risked ridicule, wasted time, endured frustra- tion, and chased the planet Venus, to try to unravel the UFO mystery. Effects of Computer Effects of Computer Effects of Computer Effects of Computer Effects of Computer Technology on Photo/Video Technology on Photo/Video Technology on Photo/Video Technology on Photo/Video Technology on Photo/Video Analysis Analysis Analysis Analysis Analysis The MUFON UFO Journal asked Jeff Sainio to update this topic to include electronic and digital media. Following is his update on the effects of computer technology on UFO photo/video analysis. As I’d expected, photo/video evidence is increasingly electronic/digital rather than film and classic camcorder. Although I receive about a case per day, I’ve not received a film or VHS tape UFO case in years. (I get some “ghost” photos, mostly on film, which, as non- UFO, are not analyzed.) The cases I get are probably 95% misidentifications of ordinary objects (usually insects or birds) or simply too vague (i.e. tiny, misfocused) to make any conclusions. The rest are about evenly Photo/Video Analysis Continued from page 7"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"      9 MUFON UFO Journal August 2007 Photo/Video Analysis Continued from page 8 split between fakes and objects which appear unconventional. If these figures are surprising to the reader, remember that I receive cases from curious, timid, members of the public who want no publicity, just a scientific explanation of their experience. I only publicize cases that are both interesting and specifically released for publication; a rare combina- tion. Even obvious fakes are subject to these rules; the confidentiality of the submitter is paramount. The public never sees these cases. Equipment advancements have made for some changes. Film defects are now rare, replaced by data-com- pression artifacts, a worse but more predictable problem. Digital video quality is vastly worse than analog camcorders; the video is “intelligently” compressed for more capacity, losing subtle detail and motion unobvious to the ordinary viewer but essential for analysis. Worse, witnesses will shrink the video to the size of a postage stamp for small file- size, and then expect meaningful analysis. Despite what you saw on X- Files reruns, no amount of enhancement will replace the lost resolution. How to Judge a Case The best way for the non- photoanalyst to judge a case is simple: don’t look at the photo/video, look at the photo/videographer. Somebody looking for attention, money, fame or groupies should get close scrutiny. A suspected- fraud sighting should be treated similarly to a crime: does the witness have the means, motivation, and opportunity to produce the evidence in question? Does the witness testimony corroborate or contradict the photo/video evidence? The easiest way for a faker to avoid contradicting the testimony and the evidence, is to omit the testimony. No case is complete without testimony, and missing testimony should be suspect. Note that “means” is one of the criteria above. Equipment and skill are included in means. Skeptics point to the availability of computers for the pur- poses of fakery. What is NOT common is the image-manipulation software and its steep learning curve, knowledge of atmospheric physics, lens theory, camera response and other details needed to assemble a plausible case. If anything, the average photographic-skill level has plummeted with the advent of digital equipment. Most witnesses are photographic idiots, skilled enough to turn on their equipment, and find the shutter button. This is why witness interviews are so important. If the witness works at Pixar Studios, idiocy and bad equipment can’t be assumed. A resulting analysis may conclude that the photo/video evidence is either consistent with a genuine anomalous object, or is a studio-grade fake. I’ve received perhaps a dozen fakes in the last 5 years, ranging from amateur photo touchups that a rookie analyst would catch, to studio jobs requiring hundreds of hours of analysis to expose mistakes. The studio jobs always lacked verifiable testimony. And as the fake- producing equipment gets faster, the fake-analyzing equipment (my ordinary PC and custom analysis software) does too. Video in particular, provides vast amounts of data. But analysis techniques which were previously impractical are now fast and easy. Video provides motion, both of the unknown object, and showing the motion of the camcorder. Every studio-level fake video I’ve analyzed failed to quite fit UFO motion into camcorder motion. So what characterizes the compel- ling “real” case? Photos contain too little information to be compelling these days, especially the awful results from a cell phone camera. Multiple witnesses, shown in a video and identified, are the best case. A faker’s chance of keeping multiple “witnesses’” stories straight is minuscule. Older children in particular are excellent witnesses, old enough to be a coherent witness, but lacking the adult’s tendency to interpret rather than “just the facts.” What is a compelling UFO? I’ve never seen a “pretty” UFO, embellished with antennae, arms, legs, and insignia. Maybe legs, maybe an antenna, but not complexity. I have no scientific explana- tion for this, only experience. Fakers seem to love complex models. UFO performance is the most common criterion separating anomalous cases from misidentifica-tions; silent hovering, astonishing acceleration, non-FAA lighting. (If a video shows an FAA- compliant 1-per-second flash, think airplane.) Looking Toward the Future What does the future hold? An ever- increasing portion of the world is videoed automatically by security cameras, and personal cameras/ camcorders are ever more common. Armed with “hard” evidence of a sighting, the public will be more willing to come forward with their experiences without being labeled drunkards. A sighting is increasingly likely to be recorded by multiple videos, vastly increasing the verifiability of the evi- dence. The future also will see quick dissemination of fakes via YouTube or other online video-sharing systems, absent detailed, boring, pesky witness testimony of course. CGI (computer- graphics imaging) experts can do their part by flooding the internet with fakes, with the words “April fool” (in some language) cleverly embedded some- where in the video to challenge the credulous.

Some will argue yes, while others argue to the contrary. One thing I think we all can agree upon. The supposed “Roswell Incident” of 1947 gave birth to the Modern UFO Era. And after personally being a part of the 60 th Anniversary “RoswAlien” Experience and UFO Festival in Roswell this past 4 th of July weekend, I can attest to the fact that no matter how hard our Government and Military tries to explain away the facts as mundane, and no matter how much our news media is trained to ridicule the subject of UFOs, nothing will detract normal citizens from all over our planet from making their own Trek to Roswell. The International UFO Museum & Research Center in Roswell (UFO Museum) was gracious enough to provide our MUFON representatives ample booth space where we could meet and talk with the thousands of folks who traveled from all over the world for this once a year experience. Presentations were made, facts were learned, and most important, MUFON representatives gathered as a team to educate the myriad of festival goers to the importance of joining the largest UFO investigative organization on the planet! The end result was a complete success as we were able to sign up many new members on the spot during the festival weekend The City of Roswell did a fantas- tic job of sponsoring this year’s festival, but keep in mind that the UFO Festival in Roswell only happens four days out of each year. What about the rest of the year? That is a topic I want to discuss in a way that is important to recruiting new MUFON members in the future. After the festival ends, life goes back to normal for most folks living in this small retirement community in the middle of the New Mexico desert. But that doesn’t stop eager visitors from coming to Roswell each day during the rest of the year. And when they do come to Roswell, where do these tourists end up? The Interna- tional UFO Museum & Research Center! Thousands upon thousands of curious men, women and children walk through the doors of the UFO Museum each year, and the numbers continue to grow. The UFO Museum in Roswell is a fantastic place to come and learn about the UFO phenomenon. They have gone to great lengths to preserve the history of the Roswell Army Air Field (now Walker Field and the Roswell International Air Center), and also the history of the 509 th Atomic Bomb Group. You’ll see dioramas and displays depicting the Roswell Incident and its historical timeline. There are many UFO photos, crop circle photos and the like. New Exhibit on UFO Research and Investigations But among all the interesting UFO displays, there is one thing that is missing: a section of the museum dedicated to UFO research and investigations. Now, I am happy to report, that is all about to change. Knowing the potential for future MUFON recruitment, James Carrion and I had a private meeting with the UFO Museum Director. We talked openly about establishing a much needed permanent MUFON educa- tional display at the UFO Museum. James graciously offered to donate from MUFON HQ historic UFO investigative tools and memora- bilia, with which to build a comprehen- sive display in the museum that will educate the public to the importance of MUFON and our mission of scientific research and investigation of UFOs. Our offer was met with open arms, and in the near future, a perma- nent MUFON display will be created at the museum for all visitors to experience. The future partnership of the UFO Museum in Roswell and MUFON will be a positive and rewarding one. By the year 2010, the UFO Museum plans to relocate to an all new, futuris- tic-looking building a few blocks from its current location. I definitely plan to be there to represent MUFON during that monumental grand opening! I hope to see you there! Mark Easter is the Nevada State Director for MUFON. Mark resides in Reno, Nevada, where he owns and operates Easter Creative Services, a retail adver- tising and marketing company and full service video, audio and motion picture production company.

For others, these reactions can persist, chroni- cally disrupting day-to-day functioning. For those most deeply affected, the changes in personal habits, social effectiveness, and coping skills can lead to problems on the job, relationship difficulties and spiraling depression. These victims may no longer see the world as a safe place. 7 By John B. Ringer Margaret recalls that, as a girl, she would sometimes feel herself unexpect- edly paralyzed. At the same time, she could see a raccoon sitting on the ledge of her window. The window was on the second story of an apartment building in Queens, with no trees around. The raccoon was on the inside case- ment of the window. 1 Joseph, a graduate student on vacation in rural Spain, decides to stroll outside the village he is visiting. As he passes a barren field, he spots a man in immaculate white tie and tails , dressed as if he were about to attend a formal reception. Joseph glances away for a moment, and when he looks back, the elegant individual has completely vanished. 1 Virginia is visiting France with her family. With her brother, she goes for a walk in the woods, and they apparently become separated. When, sometime later, she is reunited with her worried parents and brother, she is eager to tell them of the small deer she has been communicating with. She is excited as she remembers it saying good-bye to her. Right after this good-bye the deer disappeared. 2 These situations are all suspected of being “screen memories,” a common feature of the alien abduction phenom- enon. A screen memory is a false picture the mind uses to protect itself from something more frightening or harmful. Freud first used the term in 1899 to describe any memory which, in effect, screened out something unac- ceptable to the ego. Screen memories, by their very nature, are defensive or protective. 3 The body protects itself There seems to be an innate link between trauma and false memory. Some events are just too terrible to recall consciously, and so we protect ourselves by either forgetting or by masking the real with the made-up. There are also physiological reasons for forgetting in a time of extreme stress, and these stem mostly from the body’s “fight or flight” mechanisms. When we round the bend and come face to face with the tiger, our survival depends upon marshalling the best and most effective resources. Those leg muscles have to go into hyper-drive, and quickly! Unfortunately—or perhaps not—our redirected energy deprives the parts of the brain that enable memory storage and speech, thus people often have trouble talking about or even remembering a traumatic event. It’s all about survival. 4 Now, let’s talk about psychic trauma. It occurs when a sudden, unexpected, overwhelming emotional blow assaults a person. The event is external, but it quickly becomes incorporated into the mind. Clinicians point out that it is not the trauma itself that does the damage—it is how the individual’s mind and body react in its own unique way, in combination with the unique responses of the individual’s social group or family. As a species, we survived largely because we developed as social animals for mutual protection. 4 In a similar manner, it seems that adults who experience the trauma of alien abductions must also suffer when normal support systems are unavailable. The brain at work The brain is a marvelous organ, one which still holds many secrets. Neuro- scientists are still puzzling out just how memory works. They agree that the brain is not like a video camera; it does not provide an exact replay of experi- enced events. Rather, memories for specific events are constructed at the time of retrieval, which makes the process of remembering prone to errors. 5 Our memories can be accurate, but they are not always accurate. Eyewitness testimony, for example, is notoriously unreliable. Screen Memories may protect Abductees Read an account of a possible screen memory of an alien abduction on page 12. John B.

(You know, that fish you caught last year gets bigger with every telling of the story.) One psychological model catego- rizes memory into three different classes—the short-term or working memory, the sensory memory and the long-term memory. Working memory is fed input from both long-term and sensory memory. The sensory input provides external information from the environment and the long-term memory supplies information about objects, experiences, procedures, facts, concepts and so on. Working memory reminds me of an Internet search engine. Apparently all the accumulated data in long-term memory is searched —in very short order—to meet the needs of the working portion of memory. To add to this remarkable feat, we find that long-term memory is quite a Screen Memories Continued from page 11 Is this a screen memory of an Alien Sighting?? By Diane Johnson State Section Director, MUFON-Ventura/Santa Barbara Counties On a warm Saturday evening in the summer of 2002, I was part of a small group of people from MUFON-Ventura/Santa Barbara Counties going on a skywatch. Our skywatch site was a small “turn-around” where Stunt Road joins Saddleback Road. It was warm and clear, but I didn’t “see” anything in the skies that night. Just before 1 AM, I headed home. Alone, I headed east on Saddleback Road, a very twisty road, in my big 1985 Eldorado. I knew I had to keep my eyes on the road to stay safe. I had my seat belt on and my radio tuned to “Coast to Coast” with Art Bell. After 5 to 8 minutes of driving slowly on this road along the mountain crest, I looked to my right and saw a huge deer (maybe 5 feet high at the shoulders) running alongside my car on the passenger side. It was a male deer with a full rack of antlers; its body was light gray or beige in color. It was so close that I could see the texture of the fur. I clearly remember thinking about how much bigger it was than my car. The deer turned its head and looked at me through the windshield. I was awestruck at how beautiful it was and how big and beautiful its eyes were. It ran alongside my car for what seemed a long time, as I watched it. Time felt sus- pended. Suddenly I felt the need to look back at the road and found myself facing a sharp turn. When I looked back, the deer was gone. Only a few seconds had passed. I expected to see it running away, but it was nowhere in sight. I thought that the deer had probably run between two of the houses on my right, but, looking closer I saw there were fences between the houses. I felt a little confusion, but shook it off. As I turned north at Topanga Canyon Road, I suddenly realized that the radio was off although I didn’t remember turning it off. I was shocked to notice that the time was almost 3:30 AM! I didn’t think it would take so long to drive the back roads to Topanga Canyon, because the drive is only 12-15 miles at the most. I realized that there was no way the trip could have taken me that long, and that in fact, I had experi- enced some lost time. I’ve since learned that the deer that live in this area are mule deer, with an average height at the shoulders of 3–3½ feet. Obviously, it was not a native mule deer that I saw. Because I am a hypnotherapist, you might think I would explore this episode while in trance. But a wise person once told me that if a possible encounter or abduction wasn’t bothering the person, it was better left alone. I’m fine. Life is more interesting when there are a few mysteries.

Box 460, Lakeville, MN 55044-0460, www.galdepress.com, 6x9 soft cover, 239 pages, $19.95. Reviewed by Dwight Connelly Joe Lewels, author of The God Hypothesis , expands his views on the relationship between religion and the UFO phenomenon, moving well beyond the “nuts and bolts” approach into karma, reincarnation, healing, synchro- nicities, precognition, and spirituality. Rulers of the Earth is an emotional and personal journey in which Dr. Lewels describes his changing beliefs, which he says he has accepted “some- what grudgingly.” He bases his present ideas on such well-known sources as the Bible, but also on the Dead Sea Scrolls and other works from various cultures and time periods. Coupled with these sources is his own experience in regressing alleged abductees, his own emotional regres- sion session, and his contacts with others in the field of ufology, such as the late Dr. John Mack “I was forced to accept,” he explains, “that there were other ways to know than through the use of what scientists call the scientific method, or through our five physical senses.” Although Dr. Lewels’ degrees are not in science, he does possess a very legitimate Ph.D. in journalism and mass communications from the University of Missouri. Even so, he has come to some conclusions that seem entirely too “New Age” for many researchers—a situation which other ufologists, such as Don Ware, have experienced. He suggests, for example, that “we live in a special dimension created by superior beings for the purpose of allowing spirit beings (us) an opportunity to feel what it is like to be separated from God—the Oneness which is at the core of the universe or of the many universes.” However, rather than accepting the usual concept of man being created and directed by one god, Lewells contends that even the Old Testament talks of multiple sons of God with God-like powers. These sons of God are the “Watchers” who have been with us from the beginning. He says that these Watchers are also what we call angels. “This means,” says Lewels, “that angels were known to be not merely ethereal beings without bodies, but also powerful, willful beings who could, and often did, descend to Earth in physical form to interact with humans and create hybrid offspring, just as we find today in the UFO/alien abduction phenomena.” Among these “Rulers” are those “whose mission it is to confuse and divide the human race for the purpose of creating strife and dissension, while others are trying desperately to help us understand that we live in an artificial matrix, and that there is a way out.” Rather than allowing religious dogma to divide us, Lewels contends, we should look for the common rules or principles of spiritual knowledge. He describes his book as “an attack on blind faith, on anti-intellectualism, and on fundamentalism, regardless of the religion. It is a book that proposes that spiritual knowledge trumps blind faith, and also that it is too easy to have faith in the wrong thing.” He notes that “a look at the world around us teaches us that the human race is embroiled in a clash of religious doctrines. Each side believes that God is on its side. The only solution to this conflict is for each individual to seek spiritual truth within himself.” As these statements suggest, there is more religion than ufology in this book, and the suggested relationship between the two goes much farther here than Dr. Barry Downing did in his groundbreaking book The Bible and Flying Saucers. Whether readers will agree that Lewels has used the best sources— documents or individuals—or has come to the correct conclusions, it obvious that this is an intelligent and experienced individual trying hard to find the truth.

Friedman Stanton Friedman Continued on page 15 Intellectual Bankruptcy It is not surprising that the 60 th anniversary of Kenneth Arnold’s sighting and of Roswell, within two weeks of each other, bring out the debunkers who get a free ride for the nonsense they are trying to sell. A recent example was published in The National Post , a major Canadian newspaper, by Scott Van Wynsberghe of Winnipeg, Manitoba ( Dnumehob@hotmail.com ). Here is an open letter to the author. Dear Mr. Van Wynsberghe: I must congratulate you on your article “Sixty Years Later, We’re Still Alone,” published in The National Post on June 15, 2007. It is the best recent example I have seen of the intellectual bank-ruptcy of the pseudoscience of anti-ufology. You seem to have managed to get just about everything wrong. You did, however, adhere to the 4 basic rules for UFO debunkers: 1. What the public doesn’t know, I won’t tell them. 2. Don’t bother me with the facts, my mind is made up. 3. If you can’t attack the data, attack the people; it’s a lot easier. And, 4. Do your research by proclamation, because investigation is too much trouble and the public won’t know the difference, especially if the article appears in a respected publication. I will admit when I first became interested in UFOs 49 years ago as a young nuclear physicist, I was under the false impression that journalists and scientists had the same goal: to deter- mine the truth. I was sadly mistaken about the journalists. Just about everything in your article is false or misleading. I suspect you have no idea how far off base you are with your ten reasons for the ridiculous claim that we are alone. But before showing how wrong they are, let’s note your character assassination of Kenneth Arnold, your silly comment that “Generations later, the Arnold Incident pretty much sums up the field of UFOs as repeated in countless episodes all over the rural United States.” Perhaps you ought to break your rule for not looking at scientific material about UFOs. Read the 1968 congres- sional testimony of the late Dr. James E. McDonald (a professor of Physics at the University of Arizona) who pre- sented 41 separate cases, including reports over big cities, including multi- ple witness radar visual sightings, including sightings by pilots and astronomers and meteorologists. Else- where there is plenty of data on reports from all over the world. Furthermore, serious researchers have reported on more than 4,000 physical trace cases from 70 countries wherein UFOs are seen on or near the ground and physical changes are observed in the soil after they leave. You say “something was supposed- ly seen and reported and then a lot of fuss was stirred up by an irrespon-sible element.” I agree, and that element is the small but very vocal community of noisy negativists such as yourself following the basic rules laid down above. You say “this unchanging pattern over six decades should be sufficient grounds to dismiss the possibility that our Earth is being visited by space aliens.” The pattern has changed a very great deal and there is overwhelming evidence that indeed we are being visited. Kenneth Arnold was by himself, did not have radar, was not close to the ground, did not report beings. Perhaps you should examine Project Blue Book Special Report 14 , the largest study ever done for the US Air Force. Researchers at Battelle Memorial Institute found that 21.5 % of the 3,201 sightings could not be identified, completely separate from the 9.5% for which there was insuffi- cient information. The better the quality of the sighting, the more likely it is to be unexplainable. Statistical cross-comparisons between KNOWNS and UNKNOWNS showed that on the basis of six diff- erent characteristics such as apparent size, color, shape, speed, etc., the probability that the UNKNOWNS were just missed KNOWNS was less than 1%. The secretary of the Air Force unfortunately lied, saying that only 3% could not be explained, and that only because there wasn’t enough data. As one might expect, the authors of 13 anti-UFO books including Phil Klass, all of whom were well aware of the study, did not reference it. You don’t mention the University of Colorado study, done for the USAF. According to a special UFO subcom- mittee of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, one could come to the opposite conclusion from study director Edward Condon on the basis of the data in the report: any phenomena with 30% UNKNOWN is certainly worthy of further study. You call J. Allen Hynek a prominent believer. He also was Chairman of the Astronomy Department at North- western University and the USAF Project Blue Book scientific consultant for more than 20 years. His book The UFO Experience provides far more"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"      15 MUFON UFO Journal August 2007 Continued on page 20 Friedman: Intellectual Bankruptcy Continued from page 14 relevant scientific data than does Peebles and many cases that could not be explained. 10 Reasons Re-examined You give 10 reasons for discount- ing alien visits. 1. “Humanity has yet to detect a single ET civilization based on radio emissions.” I agree; it is the evidence concerned with UFOs that provides the basis, not the absence of radio signals. “Consequently almost all UFO sightings are explainable.” Absurd. Would you say that since most people aren’t seven feet tall, none are? That since most chemicals don’t cure any disease, none do? The problem is your ignorance about the evidence. You say UFO enthusiasms were based on the false assumptions of Frank Drake. Perhaps you should read “ My Challenge to SETI Specialists ” at my website www .stantonfriedman.com . Serious ufologists certainly don’t base their conclusions on the efforts of the SETI community. As a scientist, I won’t waste time on science writer Dewdney’s conclusion that we are the only species. Better check the evidence. There are many detections by many humans of what are fairly obviously aliens. 2. You say: “we have always seen too much in the night sky...astrology... based on ancient esoteric interpreta- tions of random star patterns.” Astrology is based on the positions of the planets, not star patterns—and those are anything but random. 3. “Human perception is shaky... eyewitnesses could be wrong.” What a brilliant thought! I presume you wish to exclude all eyewitness testimony in court even though some of it could be right? Would you throw out all judges and juries because witnesses can be mistaken? 4. “Consequently almost all UFO sightings are explainable [as identifiable objects].” More absurdity. That since most people don’t have AIDS, none do? Gold miners (unlike journalists) know that gold ore is worth mining if there is an ounce of gold per ton of ore. You say CIA Historian Gerald Haines claimed that half of all UFO reports from the late 1950s through the early 1960s were caused by spy flights. Careful study by Dr. Bruce Maccabee, an optical physicist, who—unlike you or Haines— has been studying the UFO evidence, showed that there was a decrease in UFO sightings, not an increase, when spy flights began. Whoever heard of the U-2 or SR-71 making right angle turns, or hovering or landing and taking off out in the middle of nowhere and not having visible wings and a tail? 5. “Nor is there a government conspiracy to conceal alien visitation.” You are way off base unless you can somehow read what is under the whiteout used by the NSA when they released 156 pages of UFO material on which one could read about one line per page, or the CIA UFO documents on which all but eight words were blacked out. Speaking as the original civilian investigator of the Roswell Incident, again let me say that the MOGUL explanation doesn’t cut it other than by proclamation. The characteristics and date and location of the Mogul launches simply don’t fit, as noted by Dr. David Rudiak at http://www .Roswellproof. homestead.com . Read my book Crash at Corona: The Definitive Study of the Roswell Incident. The claim of crash test dummies is equally absurd since they weren’t dropped until 1953 and were 6’ tall and weighed 175 pounds, unlike the small bodies described by witnesses. 7. “There are no alien abduc- tions...” Also absurd. Check out the work of Budd Hopkins, Dr. David Jacobs and Dr. John Mack. Check my new book Captured! The Betty and Barney Hill UFO Experience, co-authored with Kathleen Marden, Betty’s niece. You mention Susan Clancy’s work. Please check details given in Captured, as well as my review of her book (at www .stantonfriedman.com ) to see how grossly inaccurate and unscientific she was. An outstanding resource is the book UFOs and Abductions: Chal- lenging the Borders of Knowledge, edited by Dr. David M. Jacobs, a Professor of History at Temple Univer- sity, and published by the University Press of Kansas. An important contri- bution is the chapter by Dr. Don Donderi, a psychology Professor at McGill. 8. “UFO advocates are their own worst enemies.” One might equally say that UFO debunkers and journalists such as yourself, who won’t do their homework and do their research by proclamation, are the public’s worst enemies. 9. “The study of UFOs is riddled with frauds and hoaxes.” Really? There are many medical quacks, but does that mean that means all so-called doctors are quacks? The debunking community has provided more than its share of fraudulent misrepresentation. You say the Majestic 12 Document was a forgery and has been denounced by such activists as Kevin Randle. Again you need to do your homework. Try reading the 2 nd Edition of my To p Secret/Majic which demolishes the arguments of Kevin Randle and a host of other attacks on the documents, based on my visits to 20 document archives and 14 years of classified work in industry. Or check my review of his book at my website. 10. “In the end UFOs are just an overgrown offshoot of science fiction.” This is yet again another false proclamation. Try my paper “ Science Fiction, Science and UFOs. ” The reality of flying saucers aggravates the heck out of science fiction writers"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"August 2007 16 MUFON UFO Journal Ph Ph Ph Ph Ph y y y y y sical sical sical sical sical T T T T T r r r r r aces aces aces aces aces By Ted Phillips Continued on page 17 This month’s column continues the discussion of sighting incidents from the Marley Woods, Missouri sites, which have been under inves- tigation since December 1998. December, 1998 Site 2, Located 1,480 feet, bearing 145 degrees from Site 1—The property owner and two friends were watching television when the 1/4 inch thick glass on the front of the stereo cracked down the middle vertically with a loud report. They were startled by the loud noise and ran across the living room to the unit. The glass from the break was spread evenly on the floor “like [it was] poured from a salt shaker.” They had just reached the stereo when there was a very loud crashing noise at the opposite end of the house. They ran out the front door, around the south side of the house to the garage, located on the east side at ground level. There they found a junked truck against the garage door with the tow bar penetrating the door. The truck had been pulled to the gravel/dirt drive and left 12 feet from the door with the front tow bar attached and in a vertical position. The truck is a four-wheel-drive vehicle with no engine. The owner had left the truck in gear, with the emergency brake pulled on and the wheels locked. The truck has a set of oversized, wide traction tires and the bed was full of heavy metal parts. The truck had been “pushed” 12 feet with the tires digging into the gravel/dirt drive for that distance, leaving grooves, indicating the wheels had not turned during its trip to the door. There were no visible dents or marks on the tailgate or rear of the vehicle. The tow bar had dropped to the horizontal, penetrated the door and then was thrown across the garage floor about 20 feet. Five of us tried to push the truck and couldn’t move it at all. Obviously a considerable force was required to perform this action. Unknown to the Site 1 owners, numerous observations of small white globes had taken place at Site 2 during 1998. Site 2 was so active that the owner placed a video unit 30 feet above the ground and captured many of the white globes on tape. The activity has continued with several videos of “light balls” less than 10 feet from the camera. A summary of “light ball” sightings Site 2—A friend of the property owner looked out a window just after dark and saw a small white sphere moving around the camper she was in. She watched it go past the side of the camper and across the field to the south; it was moving slowly. Site 2—Richie and girlfriend saw a round white light move upward from the ground past a window.

It was the size of a vehicle headlight. From Site 3, located 2,400 feet south of Site 2—Site 3 owner has seen small white lights many times at the Site 2 property line. They appear like flashlights but very bright, seen in NE corner of Site 3 farm and Site 2 property line. After the lights appear, they move along the field and timber- line slowly and at times extremely fast. Site 3 owner has seen as many as 3 in a group. Seen from Site 1 over Site 2— Caretaker and friend saw white balls of light from the south window of the trailer. They went outside and—for over 30 minutes—they watched the two lights in the south in line with Site 2. One of the lights stopped directly over the Site 2 property owner’s house. The lights would dim and brighten throughout the observation. Site 2 house is 1,500 ft bearing 145 degrees from Site 1. From Site 3—Five witnesses saw an extremely bright white light due south of Site 3 over Site 2. It would snap on, shine brightly for 4 minutes then snap out. This off and on event continued for an hour. Site 2—A video was taken of a brilliant white object hovering or on the ground near an old wrecked truck on the Site 3 farm. It was some 2,000 ft from the camera. Site 2—The owner saw a small globe spinning rapidly four feet above the ground. He walked to a point less than ten feet from the object, turned on a flashlight, and it disappeared. The globe was less than three feet in diameter, and the witness could hear a low humming sound. It was extremely bright but did not light up the area or ground beneath it. Site 2 owner hit a deer late at night and wrecked his motorcycle. He was walking home on a gravel road. At a point less than 4,000 ft. from Site 2, he suddenly saw a white circular light in the field close to the road. It was less than 30 feet from him and appeared to be less than three feet in diameter. It moved slowly down the field and disappeared into trees. This is a very brief summary of Site 2 light ball activity. I’ll include additional video stills taken from this site in upcoming columns. Other light ball activity I have found many excellent reports involving the small white globes or light balls. They have been seen along the Site 1, 2, 3 line and in areas 3,500 feet NW of Site 1 and eight miles SW of Site 1. Farm adjoining Site 1 on the east—The same family owned this property for 20 years. The owner and his sons said the family saw many small white globes of light over those years. The lights appeared very near the ground and above the trees. On many occasions they would chase the lights on ATVs, motorcycles and pickup trucks across their fields. They stated that the lights would appear for many nights in succession then not be seen for weeks or months, but they always re-appeared. Many of the lights were seen in the heavily wooded timber area northwest of the house (Site 1), where they are still seen today. 6.5 miles NE of Site 1—A local historian stated that he and his family have seen many of the white light balls over the years. They sometimes move very fast or also travel slowly, but they do not cast a beam. They have seen them at ground level and at tree top level. One of the most unusual light ball reports comes from an area eight miles SW of Site 1. R— home 8 miles SW of Site 1— Mr. and Mrs. R were driving home on Rte —. When they arrived home Mrs. R got out of the car while her husband prepared to pull into the garage. The night was clear and calm. As the garage door began to open and he began driving toward the garage, in an instant, everything became brighter than daylight with a pure white light. They said the light surrounding them was almost blinding and their outdoor mercury vapor light went out due to the brightness. As R started to drive into the garage, a globe of pure white light moved past Mrs. R, to the front of the car without touching the car, and glided to the inside of the garage and stopped at the back wall. It filled the garage with a blinding light. Suddenly the light vanished and all was dark. There was no sound as it passed Mrs. R. It was less than two feet in diameter and traveled three to four feet above the ground. It hovered near the back wall less than four feet from the floor for over thirty seconds. No marks or traces were found on the garage wall or floor. A neighbor, Gale T, witnessed the entire event from across the street. Mr. and Mrs. R are in their mid 60s as is Mrs. T. I’ll have much more on the light balls including an EM report with physical traces in my next column. The Special Investigations Unit (SIU) is quite active at the Marley sites and will report on any current observa- tions. Still frame from video of Site 2 light ball.

As it came closer we could see that the top side was made of what appeared to be a highly reflec- tive gold colored metal. The bottom of the object was the color of dull bronze and didn’t really seem to reflect the light. Luckily I had my camera. I ran closer to the object. It made absolutely no sound and it initially moved slower than any air-plane. As it approached, the object banked to the north and after about 30 seconds reversed its direction reveal-ing its side to us. We watched it for some time as it banked back and forth, then all of a sudden it tipped its nose to about a 45 degree angle and quickly ascended out of sight. Thanks to MUFON CMS. LONG BEACH — On July 11, 2007, at around 4:45 PM, I was on my way to work from my home in Cypress California. I was driving down Wardlow Street just before entering El Dorado Park, when I was briefly blinded by an extremely bright, silver object in the sky in front of me. If I held my hand up toward the wind- shield, it would have been around the size of my thumb. After the bright flash stopped, I thought I was looking at a large metal blimp but then it disappeared. A second or two later, the flash happened again, it looked like a disc- shaped flying saucer. It didn’t seem to move until the front end rose up, dropped down, flashed, disappeared, came back, and then disappeared for good. Thanks to MUFON CMS. CHATSWORTH – Francine writes, “In the last few months I’ve been very busy, gathering videos of UFOs from the Oak Mountain area just north of me. I have acquired over 40 hours of videos. These mountains here are full of aliens and UFOs. You can watch them on www .youtube.com under Chatsworth Ca UFOs.” Thanks to Francine Illinois Flying Triangles HARTSBURG— Two nights in a row on June 10 and 11, 2007, I witnessed a triangle-shaped object with red lights around it and green lights on the bottom. It hovered in the field for 5–10 minutes 500 feet off the ground at 2300 hours, it then disappeared. The next night it appeared again around the same time, hovering in the field in a different spot. Then it shot up into the sky and stayed there for about ten minutes. Then it flew away! Editor’s Note: Twenty minutes later and 145 miles to the south a triangle was spotted. COLUMBIA— On June 10, 2007, a triangular object was observed moving across the sky on a clear night in Metro East St. Louis area. I was on the deck of my house observing a beautifully clear sky and noticed a commercial aircraft making its descent and approach to runway 30L at St. Louis Lambert Field about thirty miles NW of my home. The commercial aircraft with nose light on was moving fast and straight from E-SE to W-NW at 2320 hours. I then noticed a light that at first appeared to be a spotlight in the sky moving fairly rapidly and straight. The object appeared to be a triangle shape of lights that were not Continued on page 19 Note: These reports are presented in order to keep readers informed of some of the vast number of sightings being reported.

One side seemed longer than the other and had a straight line of lights on the tail end. It was silent and blocked out the light from stars as it passed in front of them. It moved faster than the landing commercial aircraft to its left. It could have been viewed by the co-pilot at about a 1 o’clock high position. The unknown object then passed above the commer- cial aircraft and continued on a 290 course almost due west. I spent 20 years in the United States Air Force with over 5,000 flight hours and know this was no aircraft I have ever seen. (NUFORC Note: We spoke with this witness via telephone, and found him to be quite sober- minded. Given his manner over the telephone, combined with his experi- ence, we suspect he is an excellent and qualified witness. PD) OAKFORD— In June of this year my son became frantic about some lights he saw outside in the sky, but I only saw aircraft. When he called again I finally saw what he was observing: two or three stars chasing in all directions flyin g fast in circles. Then they stopped all of a sudden. These lights were an orange color that looked like head lights on a car maneuvering and flying in weird patterns. About fifteen minutes later three jets flying from the south going north come blasting through looking for something. Thanks to Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research www .hbccufo.or g . Oregon PORTLAND— On June 23, 2007, at 8:35 PM, I was sitting on my bed looking at the sky when I saw a white point of light similar to ones I’ve seen before. I quickly grabbed my binocu- lars and observed it for about four minutes. It was long and cylindrical, like a pipe or a pencil. I also noted what appeared to be three bulbous protrusions along the length of the object, spaced apart from each other by one-third of the total length of it. It drifted slowly towards the south, slightly southeast. It is identical to the one from the Portland video on your website from a few months ago. Investigator’s Notes: The witness provided his report in explicit detail. He is not claiming that he saw a UFO. Given the characteristics he described, I don’t know what he saw. The sight- ing was not a weather balloon since they would have not been aloft at this time. He also reported a sighting on March 12, 2007.

Canada UFOs Over Pickering Power Plant PICKERING, ONTARIO —My friend and I were near the nuclear power plant in Pickering, Ontario, on June 20, 2007, at 11:30 PM, when my friend pointed in the sky and said, “Did you see that bright flash of light?” What I saw was a sphere-looking object; I can’t tell you how high or how big it was, all I know is it didn’t make any sounds and it was hovering for at least ten seconds before it disappeared. Thanks to Brian Vike, Director HBCC. OSHAWA— On June 22, 2007, after 6 PM, I was in my backyard and noticed a pea of white light high up facing west, and snapped 6 pictures using a tree as a marker. Four of the pictures revealed a maneuvering pea of white light near the moon. The series of four pictures shows this anomaly moved in a zig-zag pattern in reference to the moon’s position. In conclusion this is an unidentified object with a zig-zig movement near Pickering. Thanks to Paul Shishis. Editor’s Note: Near Pickering, Ontario, UFOs were reported seen on June 10, June 14, on June 22, and on July 4. UFOs have been seen regularly in the area for many years.

LEONARD)— On June 9, 2007, at 8:30 PM, I looked outside my window and saw a silver shaped disk in the distance going east. It faded out, then was a lot higher and went back west, very slow. It flew up to over 500 feet and it kind of shined maybe because of the sun. It went the other way and faded away, very cool. Overall what I saw was unexplained. NORTH BAY, ONTARIO— On June 11, 2007, between 11:00 PM and 1:00 AM, two friends and I saw a multitude of inexplicable colored lights over North Bay. They varied in brightness, but all seemed very high up. We saw 14 lights doing either jumpy lines across the sky, or zip over quickly and blink out again. I live two miles from NORAD and there is no way they didn’t see those lights on their instruments. I toured the facility a few years ago, and when we entered the underground room where all the radar panels are (since moved to the surface), they shut them all off. One of our tour group asked which of the panels showed all the current UFO activity, saying, “Come on, we all know you see them,” and while she was a bit insistent, she was light- hearted about it. She was then es- corted out of the facility and unable to continue the tour. They called her “disruptive.” It’s interesting that they took her that seriously, if there is nothing going on up there.

Try Richard Hall’s UFO Evidence as an excellent source, or Hynek’s book, and read the Congressional Hearings with testimony from 12 scientists. The real problem is that you and the small, but vocal, group of noisy negativists are too lazy and arrogant to study the relevant evidence. You presume that, in your infinite wisdom, you would know all about UFOs, if there were any such thing. Have you examined any of the dozen or so PhD theses that have been done about UFOs (listed in the 10-page bibliography in my book Top Secret/Majic)? Of special relevance is Dr. Herbert Strentz’ 1970 thesis, “ A Survey of Press Coverage of UFOs: 1947-1966, ” from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University. He noted, “The high degree of ridicule present in the UFO phenomenon was reflected in the press coverage... The coverage has been marked by superficiality, redundancy, silliness, careless reporting, and lack of relevant information. The lack of relevant information was also attributable to the reluctance of the repository, retaining knowledge for 50 years or longer. No one knows its capacity, but the brain consists of over 50 billion neurons, each one connected to thousands of others. The search of this storehouse of data is parallel in nature, with all the data being looked at simultaneously. The search terminates when the item is found. 6 Of course there are other theories on how memory works. The retrieval of memories typically re-activates a process of wanting to make sense of the new material, whether the new material has just been experienced or is being recalled after some period of time. This “putting together of the jig-saw pieces” is complicated by the fact that the memo- ries retrieved may not be complete. In addition to memory fragments, the traumatized person may try to make sense of: - Fragments of dreams that were symbolic of emotional conflicts. - Screen memories. - Strong memories that actually happened to someone else. - Memories that are vague due to dissociative defenses used to cope during the trauma. 7 Returning to normal is difficult Is it any wonder that victims of trauma—including alien abduction experiences—have difficulty when literature shows that many if not most abductees believe they have been abducted previously, and will likely be abducted again. That’s tantamount to an auto accident victim believing that she has had previous severe crashes and will have yet more car crashes . How can the mind cope with that? So, what do we know? From the broad fields of trauma treatment and brain functions, especially memory, we can begin to understand what happens to those who believe they have encountered aliens and were held against their will. Typically, there is a “forgetting” which shields the individual from the experi- ence, but memory fragments tend to surface, and subtle but disturbing feelings that “all is not right” may color a person’s life.

The top 10 State Directors are highlighted in yellow. The report is based on our two measures of UFO Investigation effectiveness. Assigning reports within 48 hours of receipt, and completing all investigations within 60 days of being assigned. The “Assigned” column is a six-month running average of the number of cases assigned within 48 hours divided by the total number of cases received in that six-month period. The “Completed” column is the number of cases completed beginning sixtytwo (62) days back and going back six months from there (for a total of eight months back) divided by the total number of cases reported in the same period. The “Weighted Rank” is just the average of the two columns expressed as a percent. State Directors can improve their scores by being sure to assign all cases within 48 hours, and to follow up with their Field Investigators to ensure all reports are completed within 60 days. To be considered complete a report must have been investigated and placed in one of the three com- pleted status codes (Unknown, Hoax or IFO) by the State Director.

Researching this era reinforces for me that the UFO phenomenon is real; however, the vast majority of people in the United Stated do not know the history of UFOs nor its current reality. One of MUFON’s goals is to educate the public on this phenomenon and with each passing year that goal assumes even greater importance.
