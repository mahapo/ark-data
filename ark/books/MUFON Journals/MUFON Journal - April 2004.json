T he Stan Romanek case is one of the most extraordinary UFO encounter cases Ihave worked with since I began researching UFO en- counter cases in 1985. Stan's case is complex, with a wealth of evidence on many levels. There is ex- tensive first-hand video from several sightings events, numerous credible wit- nesses corroborating the events, and an ongoing series of sightings in the Den- ver, CO, area beginning on Dec. 27,2000 (see March, 2004, Journal). Stan's anomalous experiences con- tinue to this day. There has been physi- cal evidence on Stan's body, in his hands, as well as in his yard. In addition, during and after our hypnotic session he drew advanced mathematical equations that far surpassed his educational background. Many of us have heard the term \"high strangeness,\" originally coined by Dr. J. Allen Hynek. If Dr. Hynek were alive to- day, he would definitely say that Stan's case is full of \"high strangeness.\" He and his entire family have witnessed an ongoing series of eerie phenomena, which seem to be deeply associated with the sightings. George Zeiler, former assistant to the International Director for MUFON, origi- nally brought this case to me in the spring of 2002. George had asked me to assist with hypnotherapy and ongoing research into this astonishing case that just seemed to keep unraveling'a tapestry of anomalies never seen before in a single case. This case initially attracted media at- tention on a number of local news chan- nels in the Denver area, as well as nation- ally on programs such as \"Entertainment Tonight.\" Audiences were stunned by the staggering home videos taken by Stan of two different UFOs seen by him on nu- merous occasions. Eyewitnesses a key element If it weren't for the plentiful eyewit- nesses during the sightings and the film- ing, it would be all too easy to label this case as a hoax. The ripples of this case have extended outward nationally to cap- ture the attention of many. Although Stan's experiences continue to this day, the initial timeline of major sightings included four events in the greater Denver area beginning Dec. 27, April 2004 About the author Deborah Lindemann is a Certified, Registered Clinical Hypnotherapist, a graduate of the L. & P. School of Professional Hypnotherapy in Garden Grove, CA, a.state accredited and approved school in secondary education. She is a member of the American Board of Hypno- therapy (ABH), and the National League of Medical Hypnotherapists (MLMH). She has been a speaker at numerous conferences, including.MUFON's 1998 International Symposium (\"The Spectrum of Abduction: A Question Of Percep- tion\"). She is also a scheduled speaker for the 2004 MUFON Symposium in Denver. In 1994 she co-produced and hosted a television pro- gram for MUFON of Los Angeles, \"In Contact.\" She has authored a number of articles, including \"Putting False Memory Syndrome To Bed\" in the MUFON UFO Journal, February 1997. She is currently working on a book on the subject of \"close encoun- ters.\" . In 1994 she became a MUFON Field Investigator in Los Angeles, CA. In 1995 she co-facilitated a support group in Orange County, C A, and from 1998 to the present has facilitated an ongoing abduction support group in Fort Collins, CO, where she has a private hypnotherapy practice. 2000, through Sept. 30,2001. An earlier article on the Stan Romanek case was written by Zeiler and published in the MUFON UFO Journal in October, 2002. The primary focus of this article is to give you my first-hand report of our re- gression session, and some glimpses, into this most important case. Due to the enor- mity of information, I will focus on one portion of our session that explored a strange dream on the evening of Sept. 20, 2001 .A description of this event will fol- low. On June 25,2002,1 conducted an ex- tensive four-hour hypnotic regression session. What was revealed astounded not only Stan, but also everyone present, including his sister and Zeiler. The entire session was videotaped. The day of the regression was the first time I met Stan,, who had never had hyp- notic regression done before. In fact, he was originally quite reticent with the idea of having hypnosis done. One of the qualities that impressed me about Stan was the overall innocence and frankness he exuded. I found it intriguing that he exhibited many special talents, such as music and an excellence in graph- ics arts; yet contrasted with that was the fact that Stan had shared that he was di- MUFON UFO Journal agnosed with Dyslexia at an early age and had learning difficulties all of his life. Later in this article I will briefly dis- cuss the amazing mathematical equations that he drew which would seem to defy his limited educational background.- ' It appeared that we were witnessing one of the strongest evidential UFO cases to date, and yet up until his sightings, Stan never gave validity to the subject matter of UFOs. He was a man who cat- egorized the idea as pure ludicrous. He says, \"I didn't believe in them.\" Yet he was caught up in an amazing and complicated case that has turned his world upside down, changing his life for- ever. Stan is among the ten percent or less of the population who is able to go into a somnambulant state of hypnosis, which is the deepest level of hypnosis. It is in this deepest level that hypnotic subjects have been known to speak foreign lan- guages from alleged past lives, and relive their memories with the greatest detail. As I regressed Stan, I realized that he was not simply recounting his story, but actually reliving it, and with an authentic emotion that punctuated these events with startling poignancy. One of the techniques I use to help Page 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"ft Stan Romanek validate the potential accuracy and de- tails of hypnotic memories during the ses- sion is to begin by regressing my client back to a non-re- lated positive or neutral childhood memory, a memory that has been par- tially or completely forgotten about consciously. If possible, the memories are then either validated or invalidated by rela- tives or friends who can vouch for their authenticity. In Stan's case he regressed back to an event at about age five when he was playing outside on his pedal car on the main sidewalk of their home. He was placing pebbles on the seat, and as he recalled the memory, his words and actions regressed to that of a five- year-old. Age regression (acting the age you have regressed to) is often an accu- rate indicator for the depth of hypnosis. His sister later validated this memory. Stan had not thought of the memory in years. A safe place Typically, as with all clients, I had Stan choose a place of relaxation, or a \"safe place\" he would like to go to as part of a deepening technique, as well as a place he could retreat to if he felt uncomfort- able at any time. Stan had selected a pleasant memory of a campsite he and his family had vis- ited as a little boy on the 4 th of July. Stan's sensory details were so vivid that after the session he expressed his surprise that \"I could even smell the smoke of the campfire!\" For him it was a revelation that the hypnotic experience could be so real and exacting. I had begun to establish that Stan not only goes very deeply in hyp- nosis, but his memories can be quite ac- curate. In validating the accuracy of memory recall, or even the authenticity of a case, there is a list of characteristics I look for before and during a session: •What is the consistency of what is reported within hypnosis? •During hypnosis are there physi- ological reactions to what is being said, and is it congruent with what is being experienced? •Are there emotional reactions to what is being recounted? Are the emo- tions congruent with what is being said or recalled? •Do the emotions seem genuine? •How does the recalled information fit with the conscious memories? •Do the memories support or explain physical evidence? •What is the motivation to come for- ward at this time? •What would be the motivation to fab- ricate or make up such a story? •Does any of the retrieved informa- tion exceed or challenge the client's edu- cational level? •Depth of hypnosis achieved. There is insufficient space and time here to detail all of the above characteris- tics as it applies to the Stan Romanek case, but I will state that Stan's hypnotically recalled memories do fit the criteria above in terms of being consistent, congruent, genuine, fitting, and supportive to his conscious memory. In addition, due to the multitude of witnesses during numerous sightings, it is my opinion that a hoax should be ruled out. In regard to his motivation to come forward at this time, as mentioned earlier, Stan was quite reticent to seek hypnosis, but was deeply troubled by his experi- ences and simply encouraged to seek hypnosis for therapeutic purposes. A complete analytical analysis of the Stan Romanek regression session is avail- able by emailing Deborah@cfree.org. We commonly hear the term \"screen memory\" in connection with the abduc- tion experience. A screen memory is best defined as a conscious memory that seems to mask or replace an actual memory with something more palatable or easier to cope with. It is hard to know which screen memo- ries are a result of a memory perhaps im- planted into the mind by the aliens in- volved, for the purposes of keeping the event camouflaged, or whether it is a cop- ing mechanism created by the person's subconscious mind as protection. Prelude to a dream Either way, the following event will demonstrate how a screen memory played out in one of Stan's experiences. Here is a brief description of that event that led up to the strange dream. On the evening of Sept. 20, 2001, at around 7 PM, Stan is at work when told by employees of a large reddish pulsat- ing balloon-like craft about 500 feet above his work. Stan walks outside to see it. The size was estimated at 20 to 30 feet in di- ameter. While watching the craft momentarily, it quickly disappears. By this time Stan is still reeling from his first sighting nine months earlier. However, this craft is dif- ferent than the craft seen on Dec. 27,2000. In addition to this sighting, this same craft would reappear twice again. Stan is stunned and immediately leaves work and drives home. On his way home it reap- pears and seems to be pacing ahead of him at some distance all the way home. Now in the habit of carrying his video camera since his first sighting, he video- tapes it while driving home, and after arriv- ing home it dis- appears once again. He, his sis- ter, and best friend watch the video that night until late and recall hav- ing a headache and going to bed. The next morning Stan recalls having a troubling dream about what he called \"possum people\" coming to his door. He realizes there was something different about this dream in that it felt very real, yet he also realizes the absurdity of see- ing \"possum people\" and attempts to cat- egorize it as simply a dream. In addition he awakens with a strange pattern of deep oozing sores on his back, and hair is rubbed off his wrists and ankles in a band-like pattern. He can find no ex- planation for the marks or the dream. The regression During hypnosis I regressed him back to the time when he had his dream. I had him simply observe himself sleeping, and noticing anything important, moving him moment-by-moment forward in time. Just before he had the dream I asked him what time the clock read. He said ... \"about 2 or 2:30 AM.\" I'd now like to share a par- tial transcript from our regression. Stan Romanek (SR): Somebody's knocking at the door! They woke me up. It's the front door. Why the hell would anyone be knocking at the door? Deborah Lindemann (DL): What do you do next? SR: I'm getting up; maybe there's an emergency. Maybe someone is lost or drunk. DL: What do you do to find out? SR: I get up. DL: And then what happens? SR: I'm getting to the door, and my sister is opening the door. Oh my God! DL: What happens when you open the door? SR: There's like three people there. [See Romanek's sketch on the Jour- nal cover.] DL: And who are these people? SR: They look like they're in Hallow- een costumes. DL: What makes you think they look like Halloween costumes? Page 4 MUFON UFO Journal April 2004"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"TTze wounds on Romanek's back. SR: Because they're so weird look- ing. DL: What particularly is so weird about their costumes? SR: They have really big heads and they look like they've got cancer; there's no hair hardly at all. It's like straggly hair. DL: What color is their hair? SR: It's white. It's like they have no pigment. DL: Is that true for all three of them? SR: Yes, yes it is. DL: And how tall would you say these people are? SR: They're a little bit shorter than me, about the same size as my sister. DL: Where would they come up to on your body? SR: Oh, maybe to my chin, or a little above my chin. DL: So you're about six feet tall right? SR: Yes. DL: So maybe around 5' 2\" or 5' 3\", or something like that? SR: Pretty close. DL: And what do they seem to be wearing? SR: Oh one of them seems to be wear- ing a long kind of robe type thing, with a necklace, some kind of a weird necklace. And the other two are ... well, they're wearing robes too, but one of them is more like a jumpsuit. DL: What color is this jumpsuit? SR: It's a light blue. They're all wear- ing the same color. SR: The female has big boobs and seems to be wearing a robe. Their faces are weird,... big heads. How do they hold their heads up? Big eyes. Like distorted Japanese or Chinese eyes. Their faces where their mouth and nose is, is really long. Their jaw line is long. The nose is very tiny. Tiny little mouth. Have really tiny lips. It's just like a tiny nose...how do they breathe? A difference Stan also recalled that these \"beings\" had large blue eyes with white sclera's, quite different than most reports. This de- scription sounds similar to what many call hybrids. At this point in our regression Stan reported that the \"beings\" came in and pushed his sister aside, and that he yelled at her, \"Don't let these freaks in.\" He tells me, \"She just stands there looking kind of stupid.\" All this is hap- pening while Stan is standing in the hall- way, about ten feet away from the \"be- ings.\" He recalled them all looking di- rectly at him. Then he starts to get his headache again. He's scared. I make the sugges- tion that he hypnotically move outside of his body, just observing what hap- pened next. Moving someone outside of their body helps disconnect them from any upset or trauma by simply being an observer. During this portion of the regression he still believes what he's looking at are some strange people with masks who have come to rob or mug them. Soon after this, Stan seems to have been taken and finds himself aboard a craft of some sort where the same three \"be- ings\" are interacting with him. During his memory of being with the \"beings\" on the craft, he recalled numer- ous details of that encounter, including a procedure that seemed to involve taking tissue samples from his back, which ac- counts for the oozing marks on his back. He remembered that as these samples were taken, they were somehow being stored in a specimen box or drawer ,of sorts. I am careful not to use leading ques- tions during my sessions, and found it interesting that without asking him about the cause of his back wounds he moved to that memory on his own, simply by my moving him forward in increments to the next important memory. In addition, he also recalled at one point being restrained in an upright posi- tion near a wall, with some type of electri- cal device connected to both his wrists and his ankles. The electrical device seemed to act to control him or keep him from moving, because every time he would try to move he received an electri- cal current that was somewhat uncom- fortable. When he recalled complaining to them about this, they seemed to convey it was for his own good. This accounts for the band-like missing hair on his wrists and ankles the next morning as well. He did not connect the memory to the question of how he received his back wounds or the missing wrist and ankle hair until af- ter he came out of hypnosis. It was also during this encounter that he recalled receiving an array of math- ematical equations given to him by the female \"being.\" I've had many abductees who report receiving symbols, and/or being given or taught strange equations and unfamiliar language-many from a young age. These symbols and equations had been haunting him to obsession for days prior to our session. He recalls attempt- ing to write what was filling his head, yet frustrated that he was unable.to remem- ber it clearly. Stunning details Our session brought out the details in stunning clarity, which I'll share in a mo- ment. These mathematical equations were later analyzed by physicist Jack Kasher, Ph.D. (MUFON State Director for Ne- braska); astrophysicist Bernie Haisch, Ph.D.; and physicist Hal Puthoff, Ph.D. What is remarkable about Stan's equa- tions is that he has absolutely no ad- vanced mathematical education. Stan openly shares that he has the equivalent of a fourth grade understanding of math, and was diagnosed dyslexic as a child. His dyslexia caused learning disabilities that kept him from completing a degree in higher education. After the medical procedures, he found himself face to face with the female \"being.\" Stan recalls asking her numer- ous questions typical of those asked by many experiences who are aware enough to ask. He recalled that whenever he would ask the female a question, she would answer him telepathically, filling his head with visions, numbers, and weird symbols. As he relived various memories of his experiences, he realized that this face-to- April 2004 MUFON UFO Journal PageS"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"face event was the source of the equa- tions and symbols that had been haunt- ing him. Before our session began, Stan mentioned how bothered he had been over the past 24 hours with strange sym- bols and equations that were filling his mind. He had become obsessed with at- tempting to write them down on his own, but couldn't recall them accurately. Now it was much more clear. At one point after coming out of hyp- nosis he stated he now remembered the symbols he was given quite clearly. I asked him if he could describe them. Bet- ter yet, he said he could write them down. A page in five minutes So I handed him a large pad of paper, and in just five minutes Stan wrote an entire page full of equations and symbols. It was amazing to watch how quickly and precisely the information poured out of him. After writing this page of equations and drawings he explained each line as follows. Pointing to the first line of equa- tions, he said, \"When I asked them where they're from, this part is what popped in my head.\" He then pointed to the seven dots on the left side of the page and stated, \"I asked where they came from, this part right here; I think is where they came from, I think.\" Later he recognized that as the constellation of Orion. Ten planets You'll also notice a straight line of dots (planets) with a small arc running through it. He said that this represented where we are from, but notice he had drawn our solar system with ten planets, not nine, plus the sun. He consistently drew ten planets during several drawings in our session. Many are familiar with the hypothesis and work of historic scholars such as Zacharia Sitchen who state that accord- ing to the ancient Sumerians our original solar system had ten planets. The arc probably represented the Asteroid Belt, though Stan was unaware of its meaning, as well as most of the rest of the equa- tions or drawings on the page. From an initial conference call with astrophysicist Haisch and physicist Puthoff, as well as conversations with Dr. Kasher, the top equation with 115 circled includes references to helium and element 115. It appears to be the most likely correct ground state electron configuration for element 115, which has not yet been cre- ated. It is based on the best-known ex- trapolation of element 114, which was first created in 1998. In the opinion of Bernie Romanek i first equation. Haisch, \"This would have been very dif- ficult for Stan to figure out on his own. That line cannot possibly be a random guess.\" Haisch stated that the numbers them- selves are seemingly correct descriptions of the outermost electron shells for ele- ment 115. Element 115 brings back memories for many of us of a physicist named Bob Lazar who allegedly worked at Area 51 many years ago developing top secret extrater- restrial reversed engineered propulsion systems. He reported that element 115 was the element used by these advanced space craft for travel. Describing further Stan's equations, the second line is one of Maxwell's four equations from electromagnetic theory. This particular Maxwell equation sim- ply represents how you generate mag- netic fields from changing electric fields, which is something which happens even in the power lines in your house, but nev- ertheless is amazing that Stan came up with this in my office. The Drake equation In the middle of the page on the right hand side you'll see an equation that be- gins with N=R and ends with X 100. Stan had no idea of what this meant either, but accurately drew the Drake equation. The Drake equation is intended to be a formula to help approximate the number of advanced civilizations in the galaxy. An advanced civilization is considered to be one that can be detected by its ra- dio transmissions, or is thought to at least possess the ability to emit radio trans- missions, and that is the marker of an ad- vanced civilization. Curiously enough, Stan adds X 100 to the end of the actual formula, suggesting perhaps that what- ever the number of advanced civilizations we thought there were, this should be multiplied by 100. This case and my hypnosis sessions with him yielded several unusual sets of drawings and equations. In the end, noth- ing he drew seemed to represent any new discoveries or unknown information. Highly complicated However, many of the equations were highly complicated, requiring even sea- soned physicists to run to their techni- cally-based textbooks to validate the ac- curacy of what he had written. What is remarkable to me is that I wit- nessed him writing these equations quickly, with little hesitation-not know- ing their meaning- and with great accu- racy, with the exception of a couple of symbols turned around due to dyslexia. Although the various equations seem random and unrelated to each other, the question to be considered is whether these equations are simply parts of a larger puzzle of information still forthcoming. Eventually, I hypnotically moved Stan forward to when he's returned from the encounter with the three \"beings,\" and he seems quite shocked to find his sister still standing by the front door, frozen in position with a strange blank look on her face. This seems reminiscent of reports of family members being \"switched off\" dur- ing an encounter. Stan then recalls that the two of them simply go back up to bed as though nothing happened. Page 6 MUFON UFO Journal April 2004"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Earlier I mentioned that this hypnotic exploration all began with the investiga- tion into Stan's memory of the dream about the \"possum people.\" What Stan realized after our session was that his en- counter was being recalled through a screen memory dream of possum people. It's understandable how the uncon- scious mind might interpret or confabu- late and remember these \"beings\" as pos- sum people. I asked him if he understood how he interpreted them as possum people. He replied, \"Because possums have long snouts, and long faces...\" The sketch A few months after our session, Stan consciously recalled his hypnotic memory of what the possum people looked like at his door, and he drew the sketch on the previous page. He said this is the closest he was able to draw, and admits it's not perfect. We hope to have a forensic artist help him draw them more accurately dur- ing a future hypnotic session. An interesting note regarding the abraded oozing sores and missing hair sections on his wrists and ankles found the next morning is that they fluoresced under UV light, a common phenomenon often connected to the marks left on abductees. There is ongoing sensitive research and analysis being done on video foot- age and physical evidence, including photo analysis, chemical and spectros- copy testing, and more. The findings will be made public upon completion. Upon initial observation of Stan's case, it would appear that something quite un- earthly and unexpected perforated Stan's safe and predictable world. Seemingly, he just happened to be at the right place at the right time-a man with no history of anything alien or un- worldly. Perhaps it was a cosmic wake- up call to a man who professed his disbe- ,lief in things as strange as UFOs. On the other hand, we are left with some intriguing pieces of his early child- hood that may cause one to contemplate an earlier connection. Those pieces include a military father who held high security clearances at both Grand Forks AFB and Minot AFB in North Dakota. This was during the wave of UFO sightings in the late sixties and mid sev- enties surrounding Air Force bases and missile sites across the country. During this same UFO flap, there was a major sighting by his brothers-and add to the mix a surreal woman who mysteri- ously contacted Stan on at least three occasions, beginning at age six. Stan's case continues to be studied. Missing hair area on Romanek's wrist fluoresced under UV light. NASA develops system to read words before they are spoken Maggie McKee NewScientist.com news service A computer program which can read words before they are spoken by analysing nerve signals in our mouths and throats, has been developed by NASA. Preliminary results show the button- sized sensors, which attach under the chin and on either side of the Adam's apple and pick up nerve signals from the tongue, throat, and vocal cords, can indeed be used to read minds. \"Biological signals arise when read- ing or speaking to oneself, with or with- out actual lip or facial movement,\" says Chuck Jorgensen, a neuroengineer at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California, in charge of the research. The sensors have already been used to do simple web searches, and may one day help space-walking astronauts and people who cannot talk communicate. The sensors could send commands to rovers on other planets, help injured astronauts control machines, or aid the handicapped. In everyday life, they could even be used to communicate on the sly-people could use them on crowded buses with- out being overheard, say the NASA sci- entists. For the first test of the sensors, scien- tists trained the software program to recognise six words, including \"go,\" \"left,\" and \"right,\"and ten numbers. Par- ticipants hooked up to the sensors thought the words to themselves, and the software correctly picked up the signals 92 per cent of the time. Then researchers put the letters of the alphabet into a matrix with each column and row labelled with a single-digit num- ber. In that way, each letter was repre- sented by a unique pair of number co- ordinates. These were used to silently spell \"NASA\" into a web search engine using the mind-reading program. \"This proved we could browse the web without touching a keyboard,\" says Jorgensen. Phil Green, a computer scientist focus- ing on speech and hearing at the Univer- sity of Sheffield, UK, called the research \"interesting and novel\" on hearing the news. \"If you're not actually speaking, but just thinking about speaking, then at least some of the messages still get sent from the brain to the vocal tract,\" he says. But he cautions that the preliminary tests may have been successful because of the short lengths of the words, and suggests the test be repeated on many different people to see if the sensors work on everyone. The initial success \"doesn't mean it will scale up,\" he told New Scientist. \"Small-vocabulary, isolated word recog- nition is a quite different problem than conversational speech, not just in scale but in kind.\" The NASA team is now working on sensors that will detect signals through clothing.

America's mainstream culture, ever rigid and narrow, yet acknowledges from ^time to time that such things exist. Frankly, it would be hard not to. The reports are simply too many and too clear.

A security guard at a gated community in Dallas saw \"a single solid black triangle, with no lights of any kind,\" traveling west for about 8 or 9 seconds. The object was completely silent, and seemed to float across the sky at about 1,200 feet. The witness watched the tri- angle disappear behind one of the homes, contacted the Dallas Police Department, and was told that no one else had reported the object. This report is available on the web at the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC). Indeed, the witness spoke with Peter Davenport, who runs the or- ganization, and was found \"to be quite sincere and credible.\" 1 Here is another recent report from NUFORC. On Jan. 24,2003, a man saw a triangular-shaped object while driving at night down a quiet Arkansas road. He slowed down, turned off his radio, and rolled down his car window. He wondered if this was a helicopter, but he heard no sound. Coming to a complete stop, he PageS watched the object hover 10 feet above a telephone pole, and noticed that it had three lights (red, white, and blue), one on each corner. He saw the object for a total of four minutes, \"and then it was gone.\" Neither of these witnesses described the size of the craft they saw. In fact, the sizes of these triangles have ranged from small to immense. Most are slow-moving and low-flying; occasionally people de- scribe them as boomerang-shaped in- stead of triangular. The fact that they fly so low and so slowly is a problem that demands an ex- planation, both scientifically and politi- cally. Complicating the matter are the many witnesses who describe exceptional speed and maneuverability relating to -these triangles, such as flat pivot turns or incredible acceleration. It is a tricky problem, indeed. The famous Illinois \"cop sighting\" in early 2000 of a giant triangular object is one of the best known cases of the flying triangles. In this instance, the object was substantially larger than a jumbo jet, fly- ing at perhaps 500 feet altitude, either si- lent or extremely quiet, moving slowly, and edged with an array of blinding white lights. All this is certainly extraordinary. But what really makes this case difficult to explain is the object's manner of accel- eration. In the words of one officer, it was able to shoot away \"in the blink of an eye\" with \"no sound whatsoever.\" One moment, it was a few hundred feet away; the next moment, several miles away. 2 The problem deepens If this were an isolated incident, one could write it off as a mistaken observa- tion of some sort. But this is not isolated, and here the problem deepens. For an object possibly identical to this one was seen many times in the early 1980s in the Hudson Valley, just north of New York City. On Dec. 31,1982, people from several different- locations reported such an ob- MUFON UFO Journal About the Author Richard Dolan studied at Oxford University, and did graduate work at the University of Rochester. While working as a self-employed business writer he became interested in \"the UFO problem.\" Throughout 1995,1996, and 1997, he spent most of his spare time con- ducting \"a fairly systematic biblio- graphic search,\" hunting down the many out-of-print books and UFO documents released over the years through the Freedom of Information Act. \"Once I began to delve,\" he says, \"I found the amount of information nearly overwhelming. I was methodi- cal, however, and eventually pre- pared a detailed chronology of rel- evant events, and realized it was more than enough for a useful text on the subject. So I set out to write it.\" The result was his book, UFOs and the National Security State. Among Dolan's many speaking engagements was an appearance at the 2002 MUFON International Sym- posium. ject. This was no mere New Year's Eve partying, either; the object was filmed with a movie camera. The object was huge, tri- angular, flew at less than 500 feet, had bright lights, made tight circles in the air, and at one point shone a beam of white light onto a highway. In July, 1984, the same or a similar ob- ject invaded the air space of the Indian Point Nuclear Facility, disabling the elec- tronic and communication systems while it hovered over a reactor. During the early 1980s, the number of witnesses to such events in the Hudson Valley numbered in the thousands.

Conclusion: something real, all right, but not a conventional aircraft. 3 Then we have the Belgian cases, which seem to have been part of a series of sightings stretching from Britain to Rus- sia from late 1989 to early 1990. On Nov. 29,1989, a dark triangular ob- ject, making a humming noise, hovered over a Belgian police car and shone a bril- liant beam of light on it. Many people re- ported this object; it was seen through- out the winter, then most spectacularly on thenightof March 30,1990. That night, thousands of witnesses saw a low-flying triangular UFO (or UFOs) with bright lights flashing in the center. This object could fly as slow as 30 mph, but it accelerated to incredible speeds. Witnesses were adamant that no plane belonging to any air force could have caught this object. Indeed, that night the Belgian Air Force sent two F-16s to do exactly that. The triangles were captured on several NATO radar stations; the jet pilots could also track the objects on radar, and even see them at times. But the F-16s-the top interceptors in the world-were completely outclassed by the triangular craft. Not only could it ac- celerate at incredible speeds, and not only could it stop on a dime, but it could change its altitude almost instantly. At one point, for example, radar installations and amazed witnesses observed the triangle to drop about 4,000 feet in one second. That's nearly a mile. Moreover, this object moved intelli- gently, at least in the opinion of the Bel- gian Air Force Chief of Operations, Col. Wilfried De Brouwer, who stated, \"There was a logic in the movements of the Photograph of the triangular object over Belgium, April 1, 1990. UFO.\" Nick Pope, who soon after this manned the \"UFO Desk\" in Britain's Min- istry of Defense, had contacts within the Belgian government who \"elicited the conclusion that a structured craft had flown over Belgium that night.\" They had no idea, they said, what that object was. 4 Like the other triangles people have seen, the Belgian object was real enough. The real question is, to whom did it be- long? Ours? Or theirs? Many people have suspected this to be a secret American project. Officially, however, there is no type of aircraft with a perfectly triangular planform. The B-2 stealth bomber is an angular and odd looking beast, but it's not a tri- angle. Nor can it do what the triangles do. There is good reason to believe that the U.S. has developed a triangle. In Au- gust, 1989, a former Royal Observer Corps member, Chris Gibson, was working on a North Sea gas rig about 60 miles off the Norfolk coast. He has been described as one of the world's experts in aircraft recognition, and competed in international recognition tournaments where a long distance shot of an aircraft would be flashed on a screen for a fraction of a second. At the time of the sighting, he was writing an aircraft recognition manual. What he saw that day was a matte black aircraft shaped in a perfect isosce- les triangle, with the nose angle at 30 de- grees, in a refueling operation with a KC- 135. Two F-111 fighters accompanied the craft. The triangular craft was slightly big- ger than an F-lll. Aviation writer Bill Sweetman noted that \"no aircraft other than a supersonic vehicle, or a test air- craft for such a vehicle, has ever been built or studied with such a planform.\" 5 Generally, people have attributed this sighting to the fabled Aurora, the alleged successor to the world's fastest \"official\" plane, the SR-71 Blackbird. Of course, the Aurora doesn't officially exist, but the ru- mor mill gives it dimensions that seem to be compatible with what Gibson saw. But given that the Aurora (or the same aircraft under a different name) exists, it is unlikely that this is the craft that buzzed Belgium in 1989-1990, much less is re- sponsible for the Hudson Valley sightings. The Aurora is said to be hy- personic, meaning that it is faster than Mach 5, and is rumored to move as fast as Mach 8. But, hovering? Changing altitude in- stantly? There are no accounts of Au- rora-none by aviation writers, anyway- that indicate it can do anything like that. The Black Manta There is an aircraft in the land of leg- ends that comes closer to fitting the de- scription of some of these triangle sightings. It is the Black Manta, TR-3, another aircraft that \"doesn't exist.\" All we have, apparently, is the rumor mill, which gives this object the ability to hover silently. There are said to be two very different versions, the TR-3A and the TR-3B. The first is supposed to be about 45 feet long and 15 feet high, with a 65-foot wingspan. The second is said to be a massive 600 feet across. Bearing in mind that none of this can be confirmed, the most detailed informa- tion I could find on this elusive creature of the sky is that, among those who be- lieve it exists, it is said to be a tactical reconnaissance aircraft, first operational in the early 1990s. Funding and tasking come from the NRO, NSA, and CIA. The outer coating of the TR-3B is allegedly reactive to elec- trical radar stimulation and can change reflectiveness, radar absorptiveness, and color. It is therefore exceptionally April 2004 MUFON UFO Journal Page 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Artist rendering of the TR-3A Black Mania. stealthy. More than this, however, it is said to have indefinite loiter time at high altitudes (as high as 125,000 feet), and the ability to travel as fast as-strap your- self m-Mach 9. By no means am I an expert on the technology involved here. Those who say they are tell us that the TR-3B has some- thing called a Magnetic Field Disrupter, which is a circular, highly pressurized, mercury-based plasma-filled ring sur- rounding a rotatable crew compartment. The plasma is accelerated to extreme speeds, which is said to result in \"gravity disruption,\" and can neutralize the effect of gravity on mass by as much as 89 per- cent. This is not exactly antigravity, which provides a repulsive force, but for all in- tents and purposes makes the vehicle ex- tremely light, with obvious correlations in performance, including acceleration in all directions. This, at least, is the claim from the website of Edgar Fouche. One scientist has told me that the technical details, such as the speed of rotation of plasma, are \"not credible.\" While Fouche's site provides an ex- cellent overview of the Black Manta, much of the information derives from anonymous sources, and it is always pos- sible that details can be wrong even while the big picture remains fundamentally sound. 6 While recognizing that any discussion of the Black Manta is highly speculative, some of the claims regarding it at least come close to the performance character- istics of the triangular UFOs. Is the craft real? I have no idea. While a few aviation writers acknowl- edge the possibility that it's real, no one can confirm it, and most appear doubtful. Indeed, there those who even doubt that there is such a plane as the Aurora. For my part, I find it difficult to deny that the U. S. military has a flying triangle. Knowing the credentials of Chris Gibson, if he saw a matte black isosceles triangle being refueled by a KC-135,1 am prepared to believe him. I am also prepared to ac- Artist rendering of the Aurora aircraft. cept that there are probably other deep- black aircraft out there. The U.S. government has a history of declassifying military technologies at its convenience. By the time the U-2 was public, its successor, the SR-71 Blackbird, was not long in following. We learned of the F-117A stealth fighter in 1988, for instance, only when it was decided to increase production sub- stantially and that it would therefore be impossible to hide any longer. Chronology problems But even the aforementioned candi- dates don't explain the triangle phenom- enon. Even if something as exotic as the Black Manta is real, it is clear that this would only explain sightings since the 1990s. Or would it? How far back could we push the technology and this aircraft? Could the Black Manta have been re- sponsible for the Belgian sightings of 1989 and 1990? And even if that is so, what does one make of the Hudson Valley sightings, which are earlier still? At what point do we move from the improbable, to the im- plausible, to the ridiculous? I wonder whether the TR-3A or TR- 3B explain the following sighting: On this occasion, a clear fall night in Hastings, MN, multiple witnesses saw a triangular craft approach from the east at a high rate of speed. When it was nearly overhead at about 5,000 feet, it \"stopped dead in its tracks.\" The object had a red- dish orange light at each of its corners; these lights sometimes turned greenish. It sat motionless and silent for half a minute, then made a slow 180-degree turn, \"leaving a vapor trail.\" It then sat motion- less for a few seconds before taking off at an amazing speed. It stopped dead at a point about 15 miles away from them. It then lifted straight up \"at incredible speed\" and was gone. The object in question certainly seems to have had much in common with the Belgian triangle, except it was seen in mid-October of 1968. As far as I know, this report has not been investigated, but at the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) you can read 25 reasonably.detailed reports of triangular UFOs that were seen from 1967 through 1973-and there are several that are even earlier.

House lights went out and the two family dogs reacted. They saw a bright light in the yard, like a camera flash in brightness. They could then see three objects hovering for five minutes. They changed shape and for- mation, and moved vertically making 90- degree turns. A sixth .witness tried to use her cell phone, but it wouldn't work properly. The lights climbed at high speed and the house lights came back on. The witnesses found a melted area of snow in a triangle with circles at each tip. The event lasted 25 minutes. 02/23/03, 0900-Argentina, Las Pailas, Salta-24-year-old Milagros Linquin had gone to a rocky hillside to retrieve her goats when she noticed a shiny object on the nearby hill. Close to the summit she saw a metallic object, rec- tangular in shape with numerous visible windows. She counted eight windows on the object. Around the object she saw nu- merous shiny objects, square in shape, some larger than others. She counted 14 of these square metallic \"covers.\" At this point, her father, 74-year-old Don Linquin came up and also saw the shiny object. In the meantime, Milagros had climbed a bit further and was now closer to the object. At this point both witnesses no- ticed several human-like figures wearing white garments and moving around the object, apparently working on the shiny covers. There were five figures in total. After about 30 minutes, Milagros climbed higher in order to approach the object. The object disappeared, leaving a MUFON UFO Journal deep rectangular track in the ground. 04/18/03,1817-Russia, Kalinin- grad-A large number of local residents watched as a \"flying wing\"-shaped ob- ject flew over at high speed and plunged into Kaliningrad Harbor. The event was caught on video by a local RTR Russian State Television news crew, which was present on the naval base, filing a documentary segment on the Russian Baltic Fleet. According to a Russian Naval Com- mander, that object had been tracked on numerous radar systems as it came in. The light colored gray device, with no visible seams or rivet patterns, was estimated to be the size of a small airliner, with no sound. One Sovremini Class destroyer was slightly damaged by the ejected debris. Radiation was reportedly detected, and debris less than one meter in size was re- covered. 05/00/03-Russia, Moscow region- The witness and her mother were sitting on the porch when they saw an unusual \"cloud\" form. Thinking it was just a cloud, they retired, and late that night they awoke with temble headaches and an odd vibration. A bright beam of light came through the window and moved across the room. As soon as she was, out of the light the headache ceased. The witness went to the porch and saw a pear-shaped ''cloud\" just like the one seen earlier. It was now much brighter, with silvery, blue beams of light and a protrusion resem- bling an antenna. The witness ran toward the object and suddenly her body felt weightless and she seemed to float above the ground. She floated quickly towards the bright object, and when she was less than two meters away she fell and lost conscious- ness. She came to the next morning lying on the cold ground. She had been there for over three hours. She and her mother went to the spot where the object had been and found a circular burnt patch on the potato bed. Nothing grew on the spot for three months. 08/00/03-Canada, St. Laurent, Manitoba-Four witnesses were driving south of St. Laurent towards the golf course road when they saw flashing lights over and above one of the build- ings on the course.

The witnesses thought, after seeing a car pulled to one side of the road with the lights flashing, that someone might be breaking into the shed. Two of the wit- nesses decided to sneak in to see if they could catch someone causing damage. The younger two went back home to get their parents. As the two were half- way down to the area, they passed near a dugout and heard a loud, piercing scream. They walked another 100 feet and a three- foot tall being ran in front of them 25 feet away. Both men ran back towards the road. Shortly after, the two youths arrived with their parents. Unusual holes were found in the ground throughout the area. 08/11/03, 0500-Poland, Szcecinek- Mr. Lech Hacinski was going home after work when he saw three figures standing under a nearby overpass. One of the fig- ures left the others and walked to the middle of the road with one of its hands raised up. Hacinski was forced to stop his car as the figure stood in the road. He claimed the figure asked him ques- tions about the car and how it operated, using telepathy. After something of a conversation, the figures floated to a nearby field where a huge dark round object rested on the ground. The bottom of the device was sur- rounded by fog. The beings disappeared into the object, which ascended to the west at high speed. On the field where the object had landed, there was a 50- meter-wide circular area of flattened wheat. 12/15/03-MO, Louisburg-The wit- ness reports, \"As my wife and I were pull- ing into our driveway after a dinner out, we noticed a bright light back in our fields.

(Photo by Joel Barrett, The Circleville Herald.) Farmer's report of UFO hovering over buildings still believed 56 years later By Joel Barrett The Circleville, OH, Herald, 2/2/04 From all accounts, Bruce Stevenson, a salt-of-the-earth, hard-working farmer back in 1948, was among the first in the modern era to claim to have seen a craft from out of this world. This week marks the 56th anniversary of what locals call America's first close encounter with an unidentified flying object. Stevenson was on his farm off state Route 56 in Pickaway County one cold February morning in 1948 when he saw a strange, brilliant craft hovering over his outbuildings. He kept quiet about it at the time, but told a Columbus newspaper four years later he'd never even thought about sci- ence fiction until that fateful cold Febru- ary morn. \"I never drank, smoked, or chewed in my life, and I never read any science stuff before I saw it, and the only science I've read since then has.been about these saucers,\" he told the media four years after the sighting. It was about 2 AM on Feb. 1, 1949, when he got up to check on some sows and piglets in his hog barn, a long story-and-a-half tall building. As he stepped from his farmhouse's door stoop, Stevenson was startled by what he saw. \"As he came out his back door he saw a strange glow from behind the hoghouse,\" the Columbus Citizen re- ported on Aug. 10, 1952. \"He said, he MUFON UFO Journal thought first it was flames from a fire, but then the glow moved between the hoghouse and a 120-foot-long tool shed. ...Then he saw it.\" \"The object was round like a- dinner plate, a gleaming silver color with amber-lighted dome,\" the Citizen re- ported. As he stood about 100 feet away near a farm pump, the craft floated about 20 feet off the ground. He noticed what seemed to be propeller-like lights running around the concave bottom of the saucer. \"One detail in connection with the silver-bottom section I noticed very clearly. There was something whirling around the bottom section, sort of like a big propeller or a series of propellers might do. The movement was clear, the bottom part did not turn. Something kept whirling around the whole thing,\" he told, the Circleville Herald. The dome-like top of the craft also caught his eye. \"This part was glowing with a bright amber light-all of it glow- ing, not as though there were bulbs in- side that would show bright spots,\" he said. \"There's no use saying why I didn't run and call others. Somehow I just stood spellbound, almost in a daze I guess, while I watched the saucer glide along the top edge of the tool shed roof,\" he told the Herald. Four years after the encounter, Stevenson estimated the overall diameter of the craft was about 60 feet, and the April 2004"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUF®N John F.

The light stayed off, but I could see the silver,\" he said. The farm's sheds and barns are still intact today, as is an interest in Stevenson's tale. Pete Hartinger, director of the Roundtown UFO Society, said Stevenson's close encounter is something that's getting lost in the passage of time. \"When I give talks locally, maybe one in 20 people in Circleville even know who he was,\" he said. On Sunday, Hartinger visited the site and recounted what he calls one of the first classic encounters with a UFO. While Stevenson told his family about the encounter the next morning, he kept basically quiet for more than four years out of fear of ridicule, not going public until 1952 when there was a reported UFO sighting over Washington, DC. Historically, 1948 was a time of change. The Red Scare was beginning, the Berlin Wall had gone up, the Soviets had stolen the \"bomb\" from the U.S., and the clouds of war were gathering over Korea. Hartinger said Stevenson's encounter came about six months after the infamous Roswell, NM, incident, and about a month after an Air National Guard fighter re- ported seeing a UFO over Kentucky and later crashed, according to Hartinger. Others may have seen UFOs locally, but only Stevenson spoke up and stood by what he saw, Hartinger said. \"He's not the only farmer that's seen them-he's the only one who came out and said so. He never changed his story to the day he died. When there's a sight- ing, you look at the witness' credibility. Bruce's was outstanding, and he had an excellent view of the object.\" Others, such as Stevenson's nephew, Pickaway County Commissioner John Stevenson, said his uncle wasn't prone to flights of fancy: \"I can't disbelieve what he said. I knew him well, and he didn't make things up. He wasn't a publicist.\" Steve Richards, Stevenson's grand- son, remembers hearing the story, hav- ing his grandfather gather all the children together and show them how close he had been to the silver craft. \"That's one thing, the proximity to it,\" Richards said. \"He was about 100 feet from it. And he watched it for a long time.\" Original news clippings of Stevenson's story make a special point of the presence of eerie blue-tinted lights in the hog barn. The news accounts ex- April 2004 plained that the blue-tinted lights were used by farmers to aid in reducing un- wanted bacteria. According to reports, the lights may have been visible from above through ceiling ventilation grids. \"I think it was the lights that gave them some kind of signal,\" Richards told the Columbus Citizen on Aug. 10,1952. Bruce Stevenson Jr. was only about 10 at the time, but still remembers those blue lights. \"I don't know if they worked, but they were bright blue lights, and you could seen them for miles,\" he said. He stands by his father's word. \"He was a very honest person; he didn't tell the story right away because he thought people would think he was lying,\" Stevenson said. \"I'm a believer in them myself, because of my father's history. The universe is just so big.\" Hartinger said the public's openness to the existence of UFO is growing. \"Most sightings have never been re- ported out of fear of ridicule,\" he said. \"We find that attitude is slowly chang- ing. Obviously, people who laugh at this subject have never done any research on it. Our local library has a lot of materials on UFOs, including a four-hour video. The Internet has been a great improvement for communications and research. Some- times you can find out about a sighting the same day it occurs.\" Stevenson may .have been among the first humans to claim he saw an alien craft, but Hartinger said he surely wasn't the last. Sightings continue today. \"Bruce Stevenson's unusual experi- ence has been repeated to the present time by thousands of reported UFO sightings worldwide by reputable wit- nesses,\" says Hartinger. \"I do know the UFO phenomenon does exist. Knowledge is not a matter of belief or desire; knowl- edge is a matter of evidence. There is plenty of evidence. The Roundtown UFO Society doesn't know the origin of the UFO phenomenon; we can only specu- late.\" -Thanks to Pete Hartinger.

MUFON UFO Journal Puerto Rico sightings reported By Jorge Martin After a period of apparent calm in UFO events in Puerto Rico, sightings of anomalous flying objects have started to be reported again on the island. Among some of the reports are the following: 1. On thursday, Feb. 25,2003, Mrs. Elba Rivera and h'er husband, as well as sev- eral other people, sighted from the park- ing lot of Santa Maria Shopping Center located in Rip Piedras (metropolitan San Juan) a large shiny silvery isosceles tri- angle-shaped UFO. The triangle seemed to be motionless in the sky, and even though it appeared to be miles away, they described its size as some three inches at arm's length. This indicates it must have been huge in size. It seemed to be suspended over the region of the city of Bayamon. The tri- angle remained motionless in the sky for about a minute until a dark cloud came from the east and covered it. When the cloud moved away the triangle had dis- appeared. On March 4,2004, she, as well as sev- eral other people, observed another UFO, this time a shiny large silvery cylinder- shaped object. She described its size as \"...almost six feet long,\" again seen from a distance of several miles away. The ob- ject flew from west to east, and dissapeared in a matter of seconds. The UFO was also sighted by resi- dents in the areas of College Park and Altamesa in Rio Piedras. On both occa- sions the sightings occurred around 5-6 PM.

Caribbean cruise UFOs COZUMEL, MEXICO - A group of ob- servers were on a Royal Caribbean cruise ship, the Navigator of the Seas. The wit- ness states, \"I was celebrating my 15th birthday, and we got out of the disco for teens around 3:50 AM on Feb. 14,2004, when my friends and my chaperons saw three bright lights. \"They were white, they weren't moving, and they were posi- tioned on a diagonal line. We thought they were planes, but they didn't move, and they didn't have lights like a plane. We were over water, so there wasn't any George Filer land nearby, and they didn't make sounds like a plane. \"Then we thought they were lights on an island, but there were no islands. They weren't satellites, because they were too close to the ocean. (The day before we left Cozumel, we heard of many sightings in Mexico.) \"After a while the first UFO, the low- est one, took off; colored lights turned on and it disappeared. The second low- est UFO took off the same way, and there was no sound and no trail Finally, the third one took off the same way and we were really scared!! That's when I real- ized that maybe those stories about UFOs .could be true.\" Thanks to Peter Daven- port, UFOcenter. Cigar shape in the UK CHELMSFORD - The five craft hov- ered in a triangle shape, and then seemed to freeze, according to the reporting wit- ness. Then the craft sped off without a trace on Feb. 13,2004, at 3 PM. The objects were fully visible, and were quite low, and the bottom side of the craft each had a black circle on the bottom. They sounded like a cross be- tween a lawn mower and a vacuum cleaner. Inside the house all radios had a strange chatter on them which stopped when the craft went away. When the craft left, there was a light red trail which hung around for about 10 minutes. Before the craft left, little black dots (like spores) fell to earth. Florida Encounter ORLANDO - The witness reports, \"It was about 8:45 PM, and I was catfishing at Lake Downy Park just east of down- town Orlando on Feb. 6,2004.1 had a feel- ing something was watching me, and for about five minutes I kept looking around me and saw nothing. \"It was very dark, but the moon made things OK to see. I heard footsteps in the woods/marsh on the side of lake near the dock I was fishing from, and I saw and heard a ripple in the water near the shore. Then I saw two stork-like legs and a head watching me. \"It looked right at me, and I was very scared and yelled, \"Hey!\" It stood up like a man my size or so, and stared me dead in the eyes. I went to run off the dock, but when I did so, it walked at a slow pace toward the end of dock to trap me. I phoned 911 and they told me to stay put, and the police were coming. \"What I saw was not human, and was not a native animal, but apparently, it didn't want to hurt me, because if it wanted to, it could have. Later, I called the FBI, and they said they can't help. \"Since then I can't sleep. I see that face and I'm scared to even sleep. I'm 22 years old and never have seen anything like that in my life. For proof, please call the Orange County Sheriff Department.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, UFOcenter. North Carolina flying triangle SHILOH - A criminal justice profes- sional was coming home from work Feb. 8, 2004, at 6:20 AM, and spotted a craft flying at treetop level. He reports, \"As I crossed a little bridge on 343 the craft flared to the left and flew south along 343, steadily increasing speed until I lost sight of the craft. The underside of the craft was unusual, with three conical-shaped depressions that glowed a bluish color that turned to white as it picked up speed. The top of the fly- ing triangle craft was jet black.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, UFOcenter. Five discs in Arizona SCOTTSDALE - A couple who are in- vestors and own two companies wit- nessed five disc-shaped ships enter the lower atmosphere at 11 PM from the northeast and travel south on Feb. 3, 2004. The reporting witness writes, \"Two ships were seen through my night vision scope, and this is how I know the shape of the ships. \"We could hear two ships as they flew by. They sounded as though they were pushing against the air. All ships were glowing red, blue, and orange. As the objects accelerated faster, the lights would pulsate more rapidly. All the ships were of equal size and shape. \"We estimate each ship was the size of a small airliner. Her background is as an advertising executive, and my back- ground is director of operations in my in- dustry.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, UFOcenter. Photos in New York TRUXTON - The witness was stand- ing on his front porch at 6 AM on Feb. 27,2004, and noticed a very bright star in the clear sky, which appeared to be hov- ering over the top of the tree line. He states, \"As I continued to look up at this star, it suddenly started moving slowly, right to left, while making a humming sound. \"It stayed above the tree line for ap- proximately 15 minutes. I called my hus- band at work, and he told me to get the camera. I took three pictures of the ob- ject. I am hoping the photos got a clear shot of what I witnessed. After the pic- tures were taken, the object lowered it- self behind the tree line.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, UFOcenter. New York memory STATEN ISLAND - The winess writes, \"I'm 37 years old, and when I was about 14 years old, in 1983, my friend and I were at a nearby pond and we looked up and saw the strangest ship. I will never forget it. It was oval to cigar-shaped, with lights around the whole ship. \"It moved very slowly back, forward, up, and down. We both froze and were shocked. For two minutes we were still Page 14 MUFON UFO Journal April 2004"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"looking at this ship, and then, it took off in a blink of an eye. I mean like turn your lights off and on real fast.\" Topthat97. UFOs reported in Sweden KISTA - Strong bright lights with yel- low, blue, and red colors were spotted on Feb. 11,2004, at 10 PM. The witness re- ports, \"The shape is different from craft to craft, and some are round. They sud- denly appear and just stop for two sec- onds, go up higher in the air, and then they just fly away. \"The speed is ten times an airplane. First there were five, then they become 18.\" Two girls, 17-18 year old students, had never seen a UFO before. Thanks to Peter Davenport, UFOcenter. Australian ground traces ALICE SPRINGS - On Feb. 10,2004, at 10:14 PM, a 16-year-old observer and a few friends were out in the bush looking through a telescope when one asked, \"Hey what are those things floating around?\" They watched for awhile and managed to get one in the telescope for a clear view. The observer says, \"They were like saucers, but there were four of them that had a green color, and were hovering about 15-20 meters from the ground. I didn't see any sort of alien life forms, al- though there were trees in the way, so we didn't get a clear view of the ground. \"But I did hear weird noises coming from the direction of the saucers that we watched for at least two minutes or even more. There were about 6-7 that departed, so I think that some were on the ground just sitting there. In an instant they were out of sight. \"After they left, we found two patches on the ground, and some faint footprints were observed. No one was around, so we stayed there for awhile, just looking at the marks, and were totally amazed and a bit freaked out. \"My friends are older than me: one is 20, and the other 22. We all saw it well .with the naked eye, and I also got the telescope on them. They looked unreal!\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, UFOcenter. Astronaut says we are not alone The St. Petersburg Times reports that Astonaut Edgar Mitchell announced that, \"the Earth is being visited by extraterres- trials.\" The sixth astronaut to walk on the moon told 200 people in the audience that the Presidents after Kennedy were not briefed on the situation. New Jersey video April 2004 ALPHA - On Feb. 27,2004, when the husband came home, his 12-year-old son and wife were very excited and nervous, saying they had just seen UFOs and caught them on video. They said the ob- jects were close, quiet, and moved unlike airplanes. The husband reports, \"I watched a few minutes of the tape, and. being an airplane mechanic by trade, they did not have a classic light pattern of any com- mercial aircraft. It appears on tape to be three objects close together. Two close together, off to the sides, moving irregu- larly, and one in the center. \"The one in the center was disc- shaped and spinning-as my wife said, 'Like a top.' Intrigued, I went upstairs to try to see what I just saw on tape for my- self, and I caught on video this time what appeared to be an unusually bright ob- ject over eastern Pennsylvania, very far away, maybe 8-10 miles. \"It was most certainly not in the air- plane flight path, as planes taking off .from Allentown appeared to be moving from the NW to the SE towards me at a steady . speed. This object moved from the east due west. \"I've never really believed, but it was unidentifiable to me. It was strange. Bright at times, moving rapidly in the distance, then gone. All total, maybe 20 minutes.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, UFOcenter. Florida disc WEST PALM BEACH - The witness was called to the balcony to see a UFO by three other witnesses around 11:50 PM on Feb. 11,2004. The witness states, \"So, I look out, and it has an orange shade/ glow, and it was oval/plate-shaped. \"The other witnesses told me that be- fore I came out it was really close to them. But it was now about four miles away. Little by little it started to fade, then when it did, I kept staring at its location, but it had disappeared. \"It moved from one location to another in a quick flash, leaving a lightning-type fade from its movement. It kept doing this for about five more minutes, then it fi- nally disappeared. I and my house mates were amazed. We're still a little shaken.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, UFOcenter. Indiana dark triangle BLOOMINGTON - The witness was at a friend's apartment on Feb. 15,2004, \"and I noticed that there was a large tri- angular object moving westward through the sky without any lights or sound at 10:50 PM. It moved slowly, and I could see its outline because it blocked out the background behind it. It also reflected a MUFON UFO Journal small amount of light from the city below. \"Thinking that my eyes were playing tricks on me, or my glasses had a glare, I removed my glasses and was still able to see the object and the small amount of light reflected from it. I watched it until it became hard to differentiate from the night sky. At that time I ran inside to get my friend.\" Thanks to UFOcenter. Round object in Delaware NEWCASTLE - The witness reports, \"Every night you can see this round ob- ject in the sky that only moves slightly in the vicinity of Newcastle Air Force Base. Sometimes it will move real fast. \"Other times you can see military planes circling around it, usually when it is lower. You can definitely tell it is not a plane, star, or anything that is a common sight on a daily basis. On Feb. 28,2004, at 6 PM, we saw it. You can see it best when there are clouds in the sky and, there are no stars visible to the eye. Sometimes it will vanish suddenly, but it is very suspi- cious.\" UFOcenter. Florida lights NOKOMIS - The witness reports, \"The object appeared to be over the Gulf of Mexico on Feb. 11,2004, at 8 PM. At first there were three lights with rays of light above and below. Then two sets of three smaller lights appeared between the three lights. \"It began vertical, and, depending on where you stood, it was horizontal or at varying degrees turned. There were up to 21 lights. I called the police, and an officer witnessed this as well. He called in a helicopter, and when it was headed in the direction of the lights they disap- peared, only to return within five minutes. \"We saw them in the same location from nightfall until 8 PM or so for three other nights, and then we returned from our vacation.\" UFOcenter. Oklahoma saucer/triangle SALLISAW - The observers saw a very bright light in the southwest sky on Feb. 14,2004, about 7:30 PM, that seemed to be hovering at a low altitude. They state, \"We began to look around and saw two more, one to the east and the other to the west. We got our binocu- lars out to get a better look and saw a saucer-shaped object, it was very large. \"The object seemed to have very bright lights in quarter sections around it. The lights were fire red, purple, or- ange, .and a light green color. The other two were the same, but smaller. \"The one in the southwest was lower- ing itself slowly to the ground, and as it Page .15"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"did, it'turned triangular-shaped, and all we could see was a fire red color with clear, : bright light glowing around it. It went down into the side of a mountain. \"Then we started looking at the other two. They moved back and forth and up and down, then they just disappeared.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, UFOcenter. Silver object in Ohio LYNDHURST - Driving north on Brainard road, just before May field, on Feb. 11, 2004, at 8:22 AM, the witness noticed a long, silver object about 50 de- grees above the horizon. He was stopped at a traffic light, and realized the object had no wings or tail assembly. It was 1/2 inch in length at arm's length, with high reflectivity and one dark spot midway on the body. The object kept a constant side-on view, rapidly receded away to the north in less than five sec- onds, and disappeared. It did not bank and rum, and there was ho vapor trail. No sound was heard. Thanks to Peter . Davenport, UFOcenter. Texas disc-shaped object ALEDO - The witness spotted some- thing outside on Feb. 27,2004, at 5:30 PM, and asked his family about the high fly- ing object. The second witness went out- side and looked up to see a large object floating along at a leisurely pace. The.object would waiver back and forth, showing that it was a flat disc. They watched it for about 10 minutes before it floated quite high and became very hard to see. There were no lights at all on the object, there was no sound, and it had a shiny metallic skin. One witness \"thinks\" there might have been a design on the flat face of the ob- ject. Thanks to Peter Davenport, UFOcenter. Flying triangles in Poland WARSAW - The witness reports, \"I was going home with my friends, taking a shortcut by the forest on February 21, 2004, at 2 PM. Suddenly we saw three triangle-shaped aircraft moving from south to north at a terrific speed. \"We heard a little bit strange sound; it was something like an electrical trans- former or high voltage converter. Two of these flying triangles had four lights, and three of them were in the corners of the triangular shape objectss with a blue color. \"One light was at the center of the plane/ship with a red/orange color and was pulsing. Trie third ship was bigger than .those two described above and had more lights located at the edges. The ob- jects were flying in formation and were looking-marvelous.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Orange spheres in Missouri ANNAPOLIS - Two brothers were driving on Champion Springs Ranch road on the evening of Feb. 10,2004, at around 7 PM .near Black River when they saw five very brightly shining orange spheres in the sky. At first the objects shot around like the balls that shoot out of Roman candles. They then began to fly in V formation like a flock of geese. This was in a wooded area, and at times the light from the spheres would shine across the tops of the trees. After the spheres vanished, there were several blinking lights in the sky that looked like airplanes. Then the witnesses heard very loud booms in the sky, like sonic booms. \"I later spoke to the owner of the ranch, who told us she saw the spheres as well and that she had seen them on other occa- sions,\" reported the witness. Thanks to Peter Davenport, UFOcenter. California Disneyland object ANAHEIM - On March 1, 2004, two witnesses noticed a black roundish ob- ject that was hovering above the Disneyland hotel at 10:50 AM. There were no lights or sounds from the object, and there were no surface features noticeable. It was an overcast day, and the object appeared high and not very large. The witness says, \"At first we thought in might be a Mickey Mouse balloon, be- cause it seemed to change shape slightly as it floated. After about a minute it started floating to the south very slowly, but it didn't quite behave like a balloon. \"Its movements were a strange kind of slow bobbing, and it was moving in the opposite direction of the wind. After five minutes of this, the object changed from a round shape to strait as an arrow and shot off to the east at a very high speed. It was quickly out of sight in a couple of seconds, making no sound.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Washington State encounter EATONVILLE - On Dec. 26,2003, just before midnight, D.H., age 41, was awak- ened in his travel trailer and clearly saw a red orb three inches in diameter floating around. The baseball-size red ball had a two inch red mist around it, so its total diameter was about five inches. Although the red light was \"hazy,\" it lit up the entire interior compartment of the trailer. \"It was an extremely bright light hovering in the same spot,\" he said. He leaned up on his right elbow very slowly, and the light moved about half an inch further inside the trailer, and then bolted out the door. D. H. was unaware until that moment that the trailer door was open. He always closes and locks that door. The door slammed behind the light. He awoke that morning with a good sized bump on the back on his head. Yet, he felt better than he had in months. The door trim on the floor had a one- and-a-half inch outward dent in it. The next night he closed his eyes for a minute and had a flashback of someone pulling him by his ankles out of his bed. All of the covers had been removed from his body, and he was terrified as he was being dragged feet-first by two hands from his bed and through the trailer door. The dent was probably caused by his head striking the trim. Later he remembered a large dark gray face about two feet away with thin arms. He saw no ears, mouth, hair, or nose. Joe Ryan (co-investigator) and Will- iam Puckett have both interviewed D.H. He does not drink or use drugs, and has no history of mental illness. He is very frightened and does not even want to dis- cuss the case. Thanks to William Puckett, UFOs Northwest, C A.

Fulham, 2003, ISBN 0-9687321-1-9, Amisk Enterprises Ltd, 59 Trigwell Bay, Winnipeg, Canada, R3K OH7,5x8, soft cover, 190 pages, $19.95. Reviewed by Dwight Connelly In the Introduction of this book the author says, \"Chal- lenges of Change reveals in- formation that some readers will find shocking, irreverent and unbelievable.\" While I did not find the information shocking or especially irrev- erent, I did find most of it un- believable. The subject matter in- cludes virtually every UFO topic, current or historical, including Pleiadians, Billy Meir, the Moon, Mars, Reptilians, Nazca, Stonehenge, crop circles, abductions, animal mutilations, Chupacabras, the Mothman, the Philadelphia Experiment, the Voronezh incident, Sasquatch, the Vajginha (Brazil) case, etc., etc And, believe it or not, each one of these mysteries is solved and explained- at least so far as the author is concerned. If this were not enough, there are ex- planations for the Sphinx scrolls, the Black Hole, spaceships, wars, \"the day computers die,\" Russia's Yeltson and his challenge to the UFO \"Cabal,\" the uni- verse, the \"Council of Eight,\" etc., etc. And wh~ere~'do all these answers come from? According to the author, they come from a group called the Transendors through the channeling of Rick Thurston, who reportedly \"acts as a medium, in a comatose state, and is not aware of the substance of the dialogue.\" The author does not otherwise explain who Thurston is. The Transendors are described as \"a spiritual group of approximately 43,000 souls.whd exist in the Astral plane which mankind often refers to as Paradise, Heaven, Nirvana, the Happy Hunting Grounds, and so on.\" I do not doubt the sincerity or good will of the author, who says he is a former officer in the North American Air Defense System. The fact that he believes what he writes is, I think, borne out in the fact that he dealt with the volatile topic of the location and future of Saddam Hussein in this book, despite the fact that Saddam's whereabouts were a mystery when the manuscript was sent to the printer last No- vember. Unfortunately, the Transendors failed to correctly predict what would happen to Saddam, saying, \"We don't see him extending his physical reality much longer.. ..In all probabil- ity, he may turn up somewhere in a non-living state and no one will know what happened to him.\" When Saddam did turn up- very much alive-the author inserted an addendum to the book, contending that Saddam suspected he would be assassinated while hiding in Syria, so he returned to Iraq to hide and grow a beard in anticipation of an escape to South America. Apparently even the Transendors don't get it right every time. Equally unimpressive are the accounts by the author of the various UFO inci- dents described, such as the Voronezh entity sighting in Russia, Roswell, and the Philadelphia Experiment. The Philadelphia Experiment-which most ufologists agree was a non-event- was an unsuccessful attempt by the U.S. Navy (assisted by Einstein) to test an anti- gravity weapon involving repulsive mag- netic field technology, according to the author. The technology is called the Transfer- ence Induction System (T.I.S.), says the author, and would not only be the ulti- mate weapon, but would also protect Earth against asteroids and meteorites, ward off unfriendly alien intrusions, and power our spaceships to distant stars. Also on the horizon, say the Transcendors, is a variation of cold fu- sion which will create free and inexhaust- ible energy. Is Dr. Greer listening? If you have lost faith in traditional re- search, science, and religion, then per- haps this book will fill that void. Newsletters appreciated The MUFON UFO Journal staff ap- preciates receiving newsletters from lo- cal MUFON groups.' Various sources Indicate possibility of life on Mars Evidence of water \"One of NASA's robotic rovers has found evidence that parts of Mars were once soaked with enough water to sus- tain life,\" scientists said on March 2,2004. \"Opportunity has landed in an area of Mars where water once drenched the sur- face,\" according to Ed Weiler, a NASA space science administrator. Evidence from meteorite A NASA news release in August, 1996, said that the team of James Hartfield (Johnson Space Center) and David Salsbury (Stanford University) \"found the first organic molecules thought to be of Martian origin: several mineral features characteristic of biologic activity; and possible microscopic fossils of primitive, bacteria-like organisms, inside of a Mars rock that fell to earth as a meteorite.\" The journal Science reports the com- pounds they elicited from the meteorites, found in Antarctica, were directly asso- ciated with fossil-like structures and car- bonate globules in the rocks. Australian evidence The Journal of Microscopy says that Australian scientists believe they have found evidence that life once existed on Mars. They have found that microscopic fossils of primitive bacteria-like organisms in a Mars meteorite match characteristics of bacteria found in mud in Queensland. One of the scientisits, Dr. Taylor, says he has found enough evidence of life on Mars to warrant a manned mission to the red planet. Solar system's most distant object discovered? (CNN) - Scientists may have discov- ered the solar system's most distant ob- ject, more than three billion kilometers far- ther away from the Sun than Pluto. The object-about 10 billion kilometers from Earth-has been given the provi- sional name of Sedna after the Inuit god- dess of the sea. Dr. Michael Brown of the California Institute of Technology and his team of astronomers, using the recently launched high power Spitzer Space Telescope, found Sedna during an ongoing three- year outer solar system project. Sedna is the largest object to be found circling the sun since Pluto was discov- ered in 1930. April 2004 MUFON UFO Journal Page 17"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"FRO] By Jenny Randies Jenny Randies The end of an institution? As I write these words the British me- dia are full of tales of doom and gloom. UFOlogy, which they hardly ever took seriously (outside of a few tabloids), is being feted by some of the more respect- able newspapers all of a sudden. Why? Because they can pro- nounce on its de- mise once again- just about the one topic that is guar- anteed to get the highbrow media ex- cited. Big stories and RIP announce- ments have been gushing forth. Several newspapers cited \"UFOlogist and skep- tic\" Andy Roberts-although the calibre of one best-selling newspaper was re- vealed by not even getting his name right and calling him Andy Smith instead. One might hope that they did their homework better in researching the rest of their story on the death of a popular cultural icon. Sadly, one suspects they did not, given that this newspaper also writes off the Rendlesham Forest case as a hoax by a disgruntled airman-a story the paper car- ried in 2003, but which is about the one solution to this complex case that we can be reasonably sure is not a significant part of the answer. Reasons to be fearful What is the cause of this obituary for UFOlogy in Britain, and by inference ev- erywhere else? It seems to be the deci- sion in March 2004 for the 20-year-old newsstand magazine UFO to fold. This is presented as symptomatic of the massive decline of the subject, which Roberts (aka Smith) defines as a product of the 20th century that has faded away along with it. To be fair, his argument is more specific than as trivialised by some media, and not entirely without merit. UFOlogy is undoubtedly not what it was, and we are at best in the sort of dark ages faced once before-in the early 1960s. Do we have legitimate reasons to be fearful for this subject that we all love? Have the naysayers won out? Has the Page 18 cover-up succeeded in covering up all in- terest in this field after nigh on 60 years? Will, as some pundits argue, future histo- rians be looking back from the end of the 21st century and thinking that UFOlogy was a passing fad, distracting mankind, but leading nowhere? Frankly, I do not think so. I think this shows the media love to shoot down things it has never really taken to heart. This alleged disintegration of UFOlogy fits in with their judgement of the sub- ject, and also has a peculiar attraction to people in the UK because we have a fond- ness for building folk up and then seeing them get knocked down. UFOlogy is not about to curl up and die any more than.it is possible to stifle human interest in mysteries. It is what mankind is all about. We seek answers to riddles-always have and always will. UFOlogy is a big riddle, and no pontification by hacks ; .or>skeptics will change that. Revolution or evolution? The disappearance of UFO magazine is sad, for it had a place in the hearts of many British UFOlogists, but it was a particularly homespun publication. Launched by the Birdsall brothers-two UFO enthusiasts who ran a local group in Leeds in the 1970s-it rapidly expanded into their personal empire, with confer- ences and merchandising. It caught the X Files generation ethos, and probably made its mark in the public domain for that reason. Of course, it had its readers amongst active UFOlogists, but they were not its target audience. I respected it, but rarely read it myself, and only once wrote for it (because I was asked). The reason is not that I regarded it as tawdry, but that it was aimed at a grass roots support which was not especially conducive to progressing serious UFO research-which is not to denigrate it. What it did, it did supremely well, hence its undoubted success. But it did it mostly for the fringe of UFOlogy-popu- larizing the subject amongst a group of people with unrealistic expectations of what UFOlogy is really all about. The X Files was great fun. But it was never real life. You should not judge the nature of UFOlogy from this science fic- MUFON UFO Journal tion. The problem is that some people did. It is that cultural element that probably kept UFO magazine afloat, and may. well have started to desert it just as they did The X Files towards the end of its long run. It is this aspect of the UFO commu- nity-not its serious element-that may be fading away. But that does not consti- tute the end of our entire community. There are also crucial reasons why UFO magazine was strongly dependent upon its editor, Graham Birdsall, and could not .survive his tragic death last year. I doubt, that you can pass sentence on UFOlogy because of the demise of one magazine that was never reflective of that UFO community in the first place. That said, there is an undoubted shift in the nature of UFOlogy which is being reflected by this magazine's closure. UFOlogy has altered in its essence very significantly because of the development of the internet. The internet could almost have been devised with UFOlogy in mind, since it provides most of what UFO groups, magazines, and newstand journals used to offer-with more flexibility and less cost. Discussion forums are more fun than some of the UFO group meetings that I have attended. You have no need to wait months to read about the latest big case, as it will be on the net within hours. These things have changed our sub- ject profoundly, but change need not be regarded in a negative sense. The UFO community has become more focused and smaller, but it has done so by removing a lot of the people who were really only interested in perpetuating the mystery for mysteries sake—not in find- ing answers. The trick will be to mobilize our re- sources better and to tailor our methods to the new world in which we live. UFO groups such as MUFON and jour- nals of record, such as this one, will al- ways have a place because they exist for the people who are seeking the truth rather than seeking just to be titilated by UFOs. Indeed they may become stronger in the absence of a newsstand alterna- tive presence. Nothing has died that we cannot live without. UFOlogy is alive and well, but it has evolved.

Hieronimus, Ph.D. http://www.21stCenturyRadio.com 21st Century Radio News Recently, a new attempt has been made to debunk one of the most famous images of Bigfoot in the world. The Roger Patterson-Bob Gimlin film taken on Oct. 20,1967, in BlufTCreek, C A, has been carefully analyzed for over 30 years, and this is just one of many at- tacks on its credibility by debunkers. Ironically, however, this latest attempt to call this film a hoax has earned little five-foot-five me a footnote in Bigfoot history!!! Believe it or not, the man who has so-called \"gone public\" to say it was really him dressed up in a gorilla suit in this famous film is named none other than \"Bob Heironimus\"! He spells it a little differently, but it's obviously causing a good deal of confu- sion out there, so here's my official state- ment on this case: That was NOT me!!! That's right; the \"Bob Heironimus\" claiming to be the man in the Bigfoot suit is NOT the same \"Bob Hieronimus\" who has interviewed countless Bigfoot re- searchers about this very film and other cases on his 21st Century Radio(r) pro- gram! Ironic coincidence??? You decide. As unusual as my name is, I have been con- fused with at least three other Bob Hieronimi in this world, so this is not the first time I've been accused of doing sorne- Photo 'by Roger Patterson thing I had no knowledge of! While it is too soon to make any con- clusions about these latest hoax allega- tions, let me simply tell you now about the track record of two of the proponents of this story: Bob Kiviat and Kal Korff. Bob Kiviat you may recognize as the name behind the infamous \"Alien Au- topsy\" footage of 1996. He has worked with Korff and FOX TV since then on several debunking films, including previ- ous attacks on the Patterson-Gimlin foot- age that turned out to be baseless. First they pointed to an alleged zipper WUFOD login & password for MUFON members WUFOD is MUFON's Worldwide UFO database, linked to the MUFON home page.

If you aren't, please contact geekology@worldnet.att.net which they had erroneously confused with a crease down the center of the creature's back. All gorillas have this fea- ture which follows the direct alignment of their spinal cord into the crease of their buttocks. In 1998 there were claims to have iden- tified the \"man in the suit\" as someone named Jerry Romney-claims which soon fizzled out. In 1999, USA Today ; claimed to have spotted an object hanging from Patterson's Bigfoot, resembling a metal fastener. This later turned out to be \"noise\" in a printed photo from the film. So the track record so far has been based more on hype than on fact. And in typical debunking style, they are going after the biggest, best known case by trying to expose the Patterson film as a hoax. Remember this: even if their claims were to be proved true, this does not af- fect in the slightest any of the thousands of other cases of Bigfoot sightings by reliable witnesses worldwide, the foren- sic evidence collected from encounter sites, and the lab tests done on them (in- cluding dermal ridges on footprints and DNA tests of hair samples that are shown to be from an unknown primate). In fact, on the Patterson film alone, a $75,000 study by the North American Science Institute was done, and their com- puter enhancement analysis suggested \"that the creature's skin and musculature are what one would expect to find in a living animal; not in a hairy suit, however innovatively it was constructed.\" The amount of physical evidence and reliable witness testimony from around the world is enough for any thinking per- son to believe in the possibility of Bigfoot. Even famed primatologist Dr. Jane Goodall has stated that she thinks it is likely that the Sasquatch is real, consid- ering that large groups of intelligent pri- mates have eluded discovery in the past. To learn more about why these and other attempts have been made to dis- credit Patterson's film, I recommend Loren Coleman's Bigfoot: The True Story of Apes in America, published by Paraview/ Pocket Books.

Friedman Technology and research Several months ago I took note of the fact that we need new blood in MUFON because so many of us oldtimers are in- deed getting older. In recent days, how- ever, I have had a couple of experiences that indicate that we oldsters still have some useful background that counts. A number of conference and program sponsors have urged me to \"get with it\" and start using Power Point in my lec- tures instead of 35 mm slides. I offered sev- eral objections, in- cluding the fact that I don't have a laptop computer, . Friedman that I often deal with students assigned to operate the projector, that I can teach anybody to operate a Kodak Carousel in 30 seconds, and that all sponsors seem to have one. Moreover, the Power Point projectors are much more expensive and take more skill to operate; I have loads of slides which I often change from lecture to lec- ture; it costs, locally, $2.50 each to get slides put on a CD; I have never had a bulb blow in over 700 lectures; and at ev- ery conference where I have seen Power Point used there has been a problem- sometimes several. I found a new advantage of slides when I finally viewed the videotape of my formal debate with James McGaha at Middle Tenn. State Univ. on Jan. 28. (The 2 hr. video is only $15, including ship- ping from me at FOB 958, Houlton, ME 04730-0958) My slides showed up very well, whereas the Power Point items with text on them showed up poorly. I have con- sulted experts, who were not surprised. It has to do with the brightness of the projector, the compatibility of the soft- ware, and, of course, slides have very much higher resolution than most digital images. Just because it is new high tech doesn't mean it is better. Not compuerized The second discovery came when I responded to an email request from AB wanting some comments from me about how important Information Technology has been for my UFO research. I noted that it helped to have e-mail for rapid communication, that it was great to use the internet to dig out a piece of trivia (Nobel Prize winner in Physics in 1958?) without leaving my desk, and that word processing was great for me because I am a lousy typist. He asked how about all my research on Roswell and MJ-12, and was shocked when I pointed out that, generally speak- ing. Information Technology was not im- portant because the 20 document ar- chives I have visited aren't computerized. One has to go there, look at a finders aid, select boxes to be brought, check the folders noted, copy what one wants, and request mandatory classification review for a document one wants declassified in the hope that it may be useful. There is no way to search electroni- cally, because those archives are not com- puterized. Furthermore, digging out news- paper stories from July, 1947, for example, required one to go to a library that has those newspapers in hard copy or on mi- crofilm. Sometimes one can get help from a li- brarian who will look up somebody in a city directory, find the year when his name last appeared, get names and numbers for people living near by, and then see if any of the same people are still listed in the latest version. AB shocked me by saying he just hadn't realized how important libraries can be when doing research, and had not been in one for years! I guess he was even more shocked when I pointed out that while I like using the white and yellow pages on the internet, it used to be that when one called telephone Information one spoke with an operator who was in the area in which one sought information and could answer such questions as \"Is that address in a good part of town.\" Now the operator is nowhere near the area of interest and, of course, knows nothing about it. . Until recently the ac- curacy was often poor, with wrong num- bers given in several instances. The point is that not everything new is better. What I would really like to do is to get readers to help me in a research project requiring some leg work using li- braries, especially ones with a large num- ber of periodicals from the 1940s on. Press reports Specifically, I believe it would be very useful to review press coverage of cer- tain ufological events in order to have ammunition in hand for approaching the media with what a poor job they have of- ten done. Here are some specific time frames of interest: 1. Coverage of the Roswell Incident in the period July 8-12,1947, paying particu- lar attention to the difference in coverage between the evening papers from Chicago west, which had the story, and the morn- ing papers which didn't (all of them) on July 8. 2. USAF Gen. Samford's Washington, DC, press conference on July 29, 1952, after the many radar and visual sightings in the DC area. 3. The Flatwoods Monster UFO sight- ing and landing in Flatwoods, WV, on Sept. 12, 1952. This is a very important case researched in detail by Frank Feschino and to be reported in his new book due out before the summer. Some of the meteor explanations were really quite funny, along with the 6' owl as an expla- nation for the \"monster.\" 4. The publication of a very widely quoted USAF press release after the completion of a huge study by Battelle Memorial Institute entitled \"Project Blue Book Special Report Number 14.\" The press release, dated Oct. 25, 1955, did NOT give the title of the report, did not mention BMI or the authors, and had this totally misleading comment by USAF Secretary Donald Quarles: \"On the basis of this study we believe that no objects such as those popularly described as flying saucers have over- flown the United States. I feel certain that even the unknown 3% could have been explained as conventional phenomena or illusions if more complete observational data had been available.\" The facts are that the UNKNOWNS were actually 21.5% of the 3,201 cases investigated, and that they were com- pletely separate from the 9.3% which were labeled INSUFICffiNT INFORMATION. Furthermore, the undistributed report showed that the better the quality of the case, the more likely to be listed as an UNKNOWN. The official lies have been Page 20 MUFON UFO Journal April 2004"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"repeated over and over again by UFO debunkers. I believe there were editorials as well as the press release, and that no newspaper noted the absence of a title, author, organization, or the actual data. I have the press release, but not much of the newspaper coverage. 5. In late March, 1966, (NY Times, March 23) Dr. J. Allen Hynek, professor of astronomy at Northwestern University and Air Force consultant on UFOs, noted at a huge Detroit press conference that some of the many UFO sightings in Michi- gan that week might have been due to swamp gas. Here again there were some editorials and a number of cartoons, many of them not accepting the swamp gas ex- planation. 6. The University of Colorado Study of UFOs, the Condon Report, was re- leased in early January, 1969, to wide press coverage . To date I have seen none that noted, as the American Institute of Aero- nautics and Astronautics UFO Commit- tee found, that 30% of the 117 cases stud- ied in detail could NOT be identified. 7. Project Blue Book was officially closed on about Dec. 19,1969, with, again, a totally misleading press release. I noted the many problems with it in TOP SE- CRET/MAJIC, but cannot recall any newspaper pointing out the false claims. 8. The ridiculous MOGUL Balloon ex- planation for Roswell was released about Sept. 16, 1994. There was a huge front page story in the New York Times, Sun- day Sept. 18, accepting it without ques- tion. Maybe some newspapers ques- tioned it, but I haven't seen them. 9. The Crash Test Dummies explana- tion for the bodies seen at Roswell was touted in late June, 1997, and widely cov- ered even in the UK, where I was when I heard about it. Hopefully, some reporters noted that none of the dummies were dropped until 1953 and that they were 6' tall and weighed 175 pounds. 10. There were over 320 journalists from all over the world in Roswell for the 50 th Anniversary in early July, 1997, of that crash retrieval. I am sure the press cover- age varied all over the place, judging by the many interviews I did there during that week. I would be most grateful for copies of any clippings, and would be happy to pay copying and postage costs for any sent to me at FOB 958, Houlton, Maine, 04730- 0958.

Shining then at magnitude -4.5, our dazzling planet neighbor begins the month low in the WNW, gradually sinking lower in the sky. Venus sets about 11:30 PM on the 1st, but about 9 PM on the 31 st. . During the latter part of May, even bin- oculars will show the planet's relatively large thin crescent phase (nearly 1 arc- minute in diameter). The lunar crescent itself is near Venus on May 20 and 21. Mars (1.7), in Gemini, is low in the WNW at dusk, setting in the NW soon after 11 PM. Mars and Saturn are about 2 degrees apart on the 24th. Jupiter (-2.2), in Leo, can be seen high in the SW at dusk. From there, it moves westward. Saturn (0.2), in Gemini, stands in the W at twilight and sets in the NW about 11:30 in midmonth. The world with rings gradually descends into the twilight glow by month's end. See Saturn. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Jupiter sets in the WNW about 2:30 AM in mid-May. A Tale of Two Cornets: This month two comets may become visible to the naked eye, and for a time observable in the evening sky simulta- neously. Comet NEAT (after the Near Earth Asteroid Tracking survey which discov- ered it) should become visible to the un- aided eye in Northern Hemisphere skies beginning the 2nd week of May. Look for it in the W about 10 PM, using binocu- lars to aid in finding the faint object. During the latter half of May, it should appear as a 3rd-to-4th-magnitude smudge of light sporting at least a short tail in the constellation of Cancer first, then Lynx. More difficult will be Comet LINEAR (after the discovering Lincoln Labora- tory Near Earth Asteroid Research sur- vey), a fainter 4th-to-5th-magnitude smudge with a short tail appearing to the S of NEAT toward the end of the month. Look for it in the WSW sky about 10 PM around the borders of the constella- tions Puppis and Hydra. Again binocu- lars are useful, if not necessary, in the hunt for the comet. (Southern Hemisphere observers may see both comets at a brighter peak 2nd magnitude.) Keep in mind that predicting the brightness of comets is notoriously difficult.

Her tentative conclusions, speculations, and recommendations are, in my view, very reasonable. As the original investigator of this his- toric incident, I can state that I would have conducted many components of my in- vestigation quite differently had I known exactly what I was dealing with back then. The Hill episode was my first expo- sure to both a UFO \"occupant\" report and to a UFO abduction scenario. In- deed, back then UFO abduction cases were virtually unknown (or at least unpublicized). During my Hill probe not everything was explored that should have been. And that includes close scrutiny of the dress. So kudos to Mrs. Budinger, and to Betty for preserving the dress all these years! -Walt Webb, Westwood, MA An 1838 sighting? In the process of reading the early his- tory of my church (1830 time period), I have interpreted a diary entry to mean and describe an appearance of a UFO over a late-night campsite. The information is found in Vol. Ill of the Church History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The informa- tion in this history is well respected and appears trustworthy. The diary inscription occurred when a group of church members embarked on a pilgrimage to Missouri from Kirtland, and occurred at night. In the book, the group pilgrimage is known as the Kirtland Camp. Actual Entry (in quotes): \"Sometime in the night a luminous body about the size of a cannon ball came down from over the encampment near the ground then whirled round some forty or fifty times and moved off in a horizontal direction, soon passing out of sight.\" The diary entry was for Sunday, July 22, 1838. The author was Judge Elias Smith, acting as camp scribe, and the lo- cation was Rush Creek, Logan County (I believe Ohio) on the farm of a Mr. Partial, inkeeper in the town of Rush Creek. The number of people who initially signed up for the Kirtland Camp: 529. I am interested in finding out if others within this individual's camp described similar information in their diaries as well. (Those with additional information should contact the Journal editor.) Glassy metal may be material of future By Brad Lemley Discover, April 2004 The wispy metal strip in my hands is 8 inches long, 1 inch wide, and as thin as aluminum foil. \"Try to tear it,\" says William Johnson, a materials science professor at Caltech in Pasadena. I pull-first gently, but soon with all my might. No go. \"See if you can cut this,\" suggests Johnson's postgraduate assistant, Jason Kang, handing me a mirror-bright piece of the same metal. It's an inch long, a quar- ter inch wide, and thinner than a dime. I bear down with a heavy-duty pair of wire cutters. The metal will not cut. I try again, squeezing 1 with both hands until my fingers ache. Nothing. But the most amazing act in this show is yetto come. \"Watch,\" says Johnson. From a height of about two feet, he drops a steel ball onto a brick-size chunk of the metal. The ball.bounces so high and for so long-1 minute and 17 seconds, with a metronomic tick, tick, tick-that it looks unreal, like some kind of cinematic special effect. \"When you try that with regular steel, it goes 'clunk, clunk, clunk' and stops,\" says Johnson.If the metal were glued to an unyielding surface such as concrete (instead of sitting on Johnson's oak cof- fee table, which absorbs a lot of the enr ergy), \"the ball would bounce for more than two minutes,\" he says. \"I've done it.\" UFO Awareness T-shirt MUFON has received a shipment of the UFO Awareness T-shirt.

April 2004 MUFON UFO Journal Page 23"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"o 2004 MUFON International UFO Symposium Planning for the annual MUFON UFO Symposium is going very well. It is shap- ing up to be an exciting and enjoyable event. It will be held at the Marriott South- east hotel in Denver on July 16-18. A registration form is included in this is- sue to make it easy for you to register for the event. Early registra- tion is suggested if you want to cap- ture the very low hotel room rates that we have ad- vertised.  John Schuessler Joining the list of outstanding speak- ers this year is John Greenewald. His Black Vault has documented more than 100,000 pages of government documents related to the UFO phenomenon. This documentation has shown that our government is still investigating and hiding the results. John will be partici- pating in the \"Not of this World Day\" at Six Flags on Thursday, July 15, and then will be a part of the Friday night sympo- sium kick-off event. For the rest of the weekend he will be the symposium master of ceremonies. This is an excellent opportunity to get to know John and hear about his research. Stephen Bassett of the Paradigm Re- search Group will present the case for deception, denial, and disclosure. Steve was a candidate for election to the House of Representatives from his home state in the last election. He continues to be a force for change and the release of UFO information. He says that in any court of law, first-person evidence is enough to convict. Since we have thousands of documented cases of first-person evi- dence, we need to pursue our case in the courts as well as the court of public opin- ion. John Schuessler will present a sum- mary of the body of evidence collected by MUFON and other organizations that shows that Unconventional Flying Ob- jects (UFOs) are real and that they are not ours. Other symposium presenters, as noted in the March issue of the MUFON UFO Journal include Grant Cameron, Peter Davenport, Budd Hopkins, Deborah Lindemann, Nick Redfern, David Sereda, and Ryan Wood. All speakers will be addressing the subject of \"evidence,\" making this a unique and exciting event. The MUFON Pandora Project Bob & Lin Simpson report that the beta testing of the project aimed at scan- ning the 35 years of paper files is finished, and scanning has begun. Since this is a volunteer effort, it will be a very longtime before all the files are converted to elec- tronic form and available for researchers to study. Recognizing the magnitude of the task, the MUFON Business Board has recom- mended seeking a grant that will allow the project to proceed with haste, thereby making the data available in the near term. MUFON members can assist by con- tacting businesses & influential people in their area to request a grant for this project. Although the cost is fairly large, donors can be reminded that MUFON is a non-profit organization, and grants can be tax deductible. Special recognition can be given to the donor as well. Some similar future scanning projects that we have planned include converting all 34 years of MUFON International UFO Symposium Proceedings to CD- ROM, followed by a similar project for converting the MUFON UFO Journals to CD-ROM. Grants for these projects will be considerably less costly than the Pandora Project.
