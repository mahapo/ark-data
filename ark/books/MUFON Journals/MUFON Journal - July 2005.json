DNA evidence and the future of ufology WIChalker By Bill Chalker In the July, 2001, issue of the MUFON UFO Journal I described in some detail the strange case of Peter Khoury of Sydney, Australia, and his 1992 experience with what appears to be two female entities-one with blue eyes and wispy, blonde hair, and the other one with dark skin and an Asian appear- ance. As a result of this en- counter, he dis- covered two strands of blonde hair wrapped around his penis, and immediately linked this hairto the blonde entity. Khoury, who had experienced other encounters with entities, realized the importance of this evidence and placed the strands of hair in a plastic sachet bag with a seal. It was not until 1996 that I heard from him about the hair sample. By 19981 was able to begin an inves- tigation into the sample when biologi- cal colleagues agreed to undertake the world's first PCR (Polymerase Chain Re- action) DNA profiling of ufological material implicated in an alien encoun- ter. My forthcoming book, Hair of the Alien: DNA and other Forensic Evidence for Alien Abductions, to be published by Paraview Pocket Books this month (July, 2005) uses the Khoury case as a potent touchstone, and examines evidence in cases from diverse locations, including the United States, South America, Af- rica, China, and my home country of Australia. The UFO subject and, more particu- larly, the alien abduction controversy are at a crossroads. Where we go from here will be critical for the credibility and future of UFO research. As a scientist myself, I have often la- mented the rarity of high-quality science in UFO study. Too often there is a JULY 2005 knee-jerk rejection of even the possi- bility that there might be something to UFOs. Over the years I have been fortunate to work with other scientists on the UFO problem in a sort of invisible col- lege, like the one the late Dr. J. Allen Hynek helped develop-an informal net- work of scientists who view the UFO phenomenon as worthy of serious at- tention. Many of my colleagues in this invis- ible college prefer to contribute anony- mously because \"the UFO problem\" is seen as a \"forbidden science.\" The bizarre events that centered on Khoury provided an extraordinary op- portunity to assess the reality of abduc- tion experiences. It was time that foren- sic science confronted the alien abduc- tion controversy. By early 1998 my circle of colleagues had expanded to include some scientists from the biochemical field. They were cautiously interested in UFOs, but in- sisted that their involvement would need to be conducted strictly on an anony- mous basis. The biochemists were established in their field, with well-regarded, peer-reviewed publications and re- search. Because I had an existing and reasonable public profile, and strong and established connections with key re- searchers worldwide, our group, which called itself the Anomaly Physical Evi- dence Group (APEG), decided that I would be its public face. DNA analysis begins And so it was that in 1998,\"as my new biochemical associates were lamenting the general absence of credible UFO evidence pertinent to their field (specifi- cally biological samples), I pointed to a credible sample, noting that in the Khoury case a hair sample had been recovered. Not surprisingly, my scientific asso- ciates were immediately interested. Our discussions then focused on the fact that techniques like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing of mitochondrial DNA on the hair sample might provide a strong test for the credibility of abduction sto- MUFON UFO JOURNAL About the Author Bill Chalker is a chemist and an International UFO Reporter (7UR) con- tributing editor.

Could a DNA-mediated forensic ap- proach help determine the reality of the abduction experience? If these bizarre episodes occur at a physical level, at least as we understand it, then a DNA analy- sis of the hair sample-the \"alien hair\"- would provide us with a unique oppor- tunity to apply some real science to this controversial area. This would be a rigorous test of the credibility of Peter's extraordinary claim. I pointed this out to Khoury, who told me that he was eager to have the evi- dence tested, and looked forward to hearing the results. He said this even knowing that, since this was a sexual encounter, he would have some explaining to do .to his wife if the hair turned out to be of prosaic human origin. The focused DNA profiling tech- nique we used in the Khoury case goes to the very heart of one of the key claims behind the theorized abduction program: alien/human hybridization. It provides an opportunity for test- ing the credibility of the claim that aliens are creating hybrids composed of both alien and human genetic material. If such claims are true, there should be some compatibility in. the DNA of alleged alien specimens, but some anomalies not readily reconciled with known human DNA variability should also be in evidence. Indeed, our origi- nal analysis confirmed that the alien hair came from someone who was biologi- cally close to normal human genetics, but of a highly unusual racial type. Together, two distinct phases of"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"DNA analyses undertaken on the hair sample recovered from Khoury's bizarre experience provide a striking array of generic findings. They appear to evince advanced DNA techniques and anomalies of die sort we are only now discovering—or starting to make sense of-in mainstream biotechnology. WhiJe the phase-one results initially discussed in the 2001 Journal article were not in themselves proof of die hair's alien nature, they were certainly puzzling and provocative. How is it that rare Asian Mongoloid DNA was found in a blonde hair sample which-if related to the blonde woman Khoury encountered—would have been expected to have most likely yielded a Caucasian DNA profile? The original DNA work was done on the shaft of the hair. More fascinating anomalies were found in-the root of the hair when the soft-root hair-tissue mi- tochondria! DNA was extracted. Additional analysis The very strange evidence in the new phase-two results on the blonde alien hair revealed an extraordinary anomaly. Depending on whether we analyzed die hard hair shaft or die soft root, its mi- tochondria! DNA appeared to be of two different kinds. From the lower hair shaft we again obtained die same rare Chinese mito- chondria! DNA substitution. But from soft-root tissue, we obtained a novel Basque/Gaelic type mitochondrial DNA, which had a rare substitution for diat racial grouping along widi several other characteristic substitutions. This in itself was a stunning result. The testing methodology meant diat prosaic explanations, such as contami- nation or laboratory error, were ruled out. In any normal human DNA, we should obtain consistent DNA, irre- spective of where the sample comes from-be it hair, blood, or other tissue. But incredibly, here within the one piece of hair we were getting two types of strikingly different DNA, depending on where the mitochondrial DNA test- ing occurred. The rare Chinese-type DNA in the hair shaft was confirmed, and a rare pos- sible Basque/Gaelic type DNA was found in the root section. The biochemists could not explain Peter Khoury this strange anomaly. There was no evi- dence of a somewhat rare DNA phe- nomenon called heteroplasmy (where two different mitochondrial DNAs rarely appear within the same sample, usually a result of coexistence of mu- tant mitochondrial and \"wild-type\" DNA molecules within a cell or tissue). Heteroplasmy, which is more readily found in human hair than other parts of the body, refers to single-base tran- sitions in the mitochondrial DNA. For example, G to A, or C to T. They are not big changes. Environmental expo- sure and aging can be factors. A research article in Nature Biotech- nology in 2000 that described cutting-edge hybrid cloning techniques to treat hair loss provided a clue. We may have encountered evidence of an extraordinary alien analogue of these techniques in Khoury's encounter. Perhaps even more controversially, we also have findings of nuclear DNA suggestive of possible viral resistance. The hair sample seems to show two deleted genes diat control production of the CCR5 protein. This protein makes it possible for the HIV virus to enter cells; its absence can thus confer immunity to HIV-AIDS, and may also provide resistance to other viruses such as smallpox. The implications are startling because less than 1% of the population has the deleted CCR5 form, which makes the already unusual hair sample even more provocative. And the CCR5 mutation occurred only about 5,000 years ago, further adding to die intrigue. Still, I must note that the limited nuclear DNA results were insufficient to achieve a completely clear result on diis matter. The DNA forensic work has given us an extraordinary level of certainty that the July, 1992, encounter actually occurred. Ail the evidence argues that the experience and the anomalous hair are not consistent with a hoax, a delu- sion, or other fantasy. - The hair sample PCR DNA study was conducted - by. Ph.D. biochemists, .well-established in their field, with well-regarded peer-reviewed publica- tions and research in mainstream bio- chemistry. Their study was conducted in .a professional private biochemistry laboratory. Other DNA studies conducted by the same team on other evidence, such as samples from encounter cases on the midnorth coast of New South Wales and Queensland, an alleged alien claw from California, and the dress worn by Betty Hill during her 1961 abduction in New Hampshire, have not uncovered evidence as interesting as that found in the Khoury_study. [The additional testing on Betty Hill's dress will be discussed in -the August issue of the Journal^ Independent scientists associated with tiiejresearch on some of diis other evidence were confident and impressed with the quality of the biochemists' work in those studies, as well as die original Khoury research. Physical evidence the key Without this physical evidence, it would be tempting to attribute Khoury's 1992 encounter to the doctor-pre scribed medication Peter was taking for a head injury. However, the hair evidence, which ultimately yielded unusual DNA results, supporting rather than conflicting with the reality of the encounter, cannot be ascribed to hallucination. During his extended period of medication Peter had this strange experience only once. Another similar encounter with ap- parendy the same strange women, some nine months earlier, only recendy clari- fied, occurred without the benefit of medication, injury, or stress as possible factors.

DNA sequence from hair sample. such as hak, was left behind. One cannot help noting remarkable similarities between the strange blonde-haired woman who coupled with Villas-Boas and Khoury's blonde inter- loper, though differences are also ap- parent. While Khoury didn't recall seeing pubic and underarm hak on the woman, DNA profiles that emerged from the shaft and root of the hair yielded the rare Asian Mongoloid DNA (usually associated with dark hair, but found in this blonde hair) and the rare Basque or Gaelic DNA (usually associated with orange or dark hak color, but again re- vealed in the blonde hak). Hak color, in biochemical terms, is determined by varying levels of types of melanin-eumelanin and pheomel- anins. The former dictates dark hak, and the latter controls brown hak. Natural blonde hak has a murkier ori- gin, some arguing it is dominated by eumelanin levels or at a genetic level via MC I R (melanocortin I receptor) gene diversity. Given that the Villas-Boas blonde was said to have freckled skin and blood-red pubic and underarm hak, it should be noted this is usually associ- ated with high levels of pheomelanin and low levels of eumelanin, linked at a genetic level by nonfunctioning alleles in the MCI R gene. Though hak and skin color are be- coming increasingly better documented in terms of thek biochemical and ge- netic origins, these issues have still not been fully resolved. Some success has occurred with the elaboration of the genetic nature of red hak, but the rest of the story is more difficult. New Scientist reported in July, 2002, that \"Hak color is usually determined by the cumulative effect of several genes, so there's no such thing as a single gene for blonde hair that could be turned into a simple test, for example.\" The field of genetics may offer UFO research important genetic signposts by providing possible genetic markers of significance to help unravel the reality behind abduction claims. The question of hybrids Perhaps Khoury's two females are the \"hybrids\" thought by some to be the goal of an alien genetic project. But the concept of hybrids in abduction ac- counts was until recently difficult to rec- oncile with our understanding of the limitations of interspecies breeding. Indeed, if we are dealing with a vastly technologically superior species that could be biologically different from us, hybrids of aliens and humans would seem both scientifically improbable and logically implausible. On the other hand, if the aliens have mastered space or interdimensional travel, arguably they would have akeady conquered the biochemical barriers that normally bar interspecies breeding. But the pace of our own develop- ment in genetics and biochemistry in the past decade has extended the hori- zon of this debate substantially. Indeed, transgenics, the transfer of foreign genetic material into other ge- nomes, perhaps addresses the logical interspecies barrier argument against human-alien hybrid claims. Budd Hopkins and Carol Rainey highlight transgenics, or rather an alien variation on it, as the breakthrough- \"the breakdown of the barrier between species\"-which may legitimize the no- tion that alien abduction may really be about genetic experimentation by alien beings. Thek book Sight Unseen (Atria, 2003) [reviewed in September, 2004, Journal\\ also focuses on strange accounts of human or human-like entities they la- bel as \"transgenic beings\" who seem to have stunted emotional ranges and carry out unusual social activities, sometimes with a sexual element to them. I certainly would be more comfort- able if dozens of samples like that from Khoury's experience existed, and if thek testing revealed some consistency of results. But for now we have only this anomalous sample, which has provided us with a strange DNA profile. Meanwhile, our findings will continue to be subjected to review and debate. While the Khoury case confirms the utility of the DNA forensic approach, the real challenge ahead for researchers is to determine if these anomalies are both valid and significant. To do this, abduction researchers should cooperate in a testing program focused on DNA profiling. Testing of a significant number of legitimate samples would allow us to validate or invalidate the apparent anomalies so far documented. Such a strategy could help us deter- mine whether the aliens are a biological reality, and if indeed any of them are visiting our planet and abducting hu- mans. The course I have argued for here is something of a potentially potent DNA paradigm, one with a strange alien per- spective. It has its roots firmly in sci- ence. The crossroads I alluded to earlier were demonstrated in the recent Peter Jenning's ABC TV documentary \"UFOs - Seeing is believing.\" While rather predictable and somewhat underwhelming in its treatment of the subject, it had for me at least two en- during moments. The past and the future One was firmly anchored in the past, and the other in the future. The his- torical signpost was the coverage of Dr. J. Allen Hynek, particularly the vintage 1960s footage of him undertaking a field investigation, complete with his ubiquitous notebook, and the profiling of his cautious transition as a scientific skeptic and USAF Project Bluebook consultant into a firm advocate of a UFO reality. The futuristic signpost was quantum physicist Michio Kaku's statements highlighting that there were cases wor- thy of scientific investigation. \"Let the investigation begin,\" Kaku argued. A common thread was that both signposts were anchored in science. Allen Hynek's scientific contributions JULY 2005 MUFON UFO JOURNAL"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"to the UFO subject were encapsulated in his classic book The UFO Experience— A. Scientific Inquiry (1972), which pro- vided his telling case for the potential of the UFO controversy as a legitimate area for scientific study. Even in what turned out to be his twilight years Hynek was steadfastly promoting a sci- entific approach anchored in solid un- explained cases. I was pleased to have the opportu- nity to interview him about these aspects during a stay at his Chicago home in September, 1984. In a more personal Antipodean focus, I was also able to get him to run through his 1973 Australian visit notebooks. These confirmed his continuing focus on using science as an anchor point in the investigation of UFOs. Michio Kaku is simply restating the obvious. Any phenomenon that reveals a consistent core of seemingly anoma- lous events should be the subject of scientific enquiry in the true spirit of open scientific study. Kaku's own field of quantum phys- ics perhaps offers an appropriate meta- phor for the UFO phenomenon. Both are laden with controversial attributes and ultimately each may have more to do with each other than mere metaphor. The paradoxical realities inherent in both may go beyond hints and uncanny echoes. Maybe Michio Kaku might encour- age a focusing on whether the UFO phe- nomenon represents.a macrocosmic manifestation of hyperspatial realities best elaborated in the burgeoning com- plexities of the cutting edges of quan- tum physics. Such complexities might be mirrored in the more bizarre aspects of the UFO controversy, particularly in UFO abduc- tion experiences. A DNA approach In my book \"Hair of theAlien-DNA and other Forensic Eiidence of Alien Ab- duction, \"I focus on a DNA forensic ap- proach to alien abduction evidence. While prominence is given to the Peter Khoury \"alien hair\" case from Sydney, Australia, other cases arid experiences from around the world are also exam- ined. While the validity of this evidence will be debated, my primary focus is to promote a forensic scientific approach to examining the alien abduction con- troversy, concentrating on the DNA ap- proach where compelling biological evi- dence is available. Part of this approach involves exam- ining DNA for evidence of \"non-Dar- winian patterns,\" which might reflect ex- traterrestrial or intelligent influence—a sign of artificial evolution or interven- tion. Clues in our \"junk\" DNA? The Anomaly Physical Evidence Group (APEG) has been examining this intriguing area, focusing in part on un- usual mutations, polymorphisms, hu- man \"junk\" DNA (or perhaps more ap- propriately \"regulatory\" DNA), and other aspects. Some intriguing areas are being looked at. Professor Paul Davies of the Macquarie University-based Australian Centre for Astrobiology has speculated that some sort of pattern along the mathematical type of code described in Carl Sagan's novel (and the film) Contact might be encoded in our \"junk DNA.\" While this sounds like science fiction, particularly if mathematical or symbolic codes are being sought, the idea is not as wild as it sounds. I briefly discussed this speculation with Davies during a Macquarie Uni- versity post-graduate open day on cam- pus on April 12,2005. He indicated his \"junk DNA-ET evidence\" speculations were meant to be serious. Davies feels the idea is no less seri- ous than the idea of seeking out ET \"radio signals\" (i.e. SETI which he agreed had not delivered any credible evidence so far). So why not try something that is far easier to do-and is potentially well within our current technological reach- search for coded clues within our own DNA. I mentioned to him that this inter- sected with some work I had been fo- cusing on, and he expressed interest in seeing my book. Whether this develops beyond mere tokenism remains to be seen. I reflected on Davies' well known skepticism re UFOs in recent times, bringing up with him his friendship with the late Dr. Hynek, originator of the term \"close encounters of the third kind.\" •- Davies acknowledged that Hynek was a nice guy and that he had once stayed at his Chicago home. He felt that • MUFON UFO Journal there is no one of Hynek's stature in the field of UFO research today. I said there were some interested re- searchers of note. Knowing he had en- dorsed Michio Kaku's new book Paral- lel Worlds, I mentioned Kaku's interest in the UFO subject. He seemed unaware of this, or skeptical of my statement, so I suggested he inform himself by watching the Peter Jennings' documen- tary which was airing on Australian tele- vision the following weekend. I alerted Davies to Kaku's open en- dorsement and advocacy of serious in- vestigation of UFOs, and said this was not the first time that Michio Kaku, \"one of the world's finest science writ- ers\" (Davies own endorsement) and a world-renowned physicist, had made positive comments about the subject. I indicated that Jennings' documen- tary would also show a positive presen- tation of part of the contribution his old friend Hynek had made to ufology. Science can help us navigate the bumpy crossroads the UFO subject is now navigating through. Sagan, in one of last books, argued that science could be a candle in the dark \"of a demon- haunted world\"-Sagan's take on a world too enamoured with dubious beliefs. However, I firmly believe, and the preliminary results certainly support this, that science, particularly with a DNA forensic focus, can certainly help light the way through this complex and engnimatic subject. Ultimately it will reveal more about ourselves—and perhaps a lot about the UFO reality that seems to be intruding into our world.

Burleson, Ph.D. The key to the refusal of Oppen- heimer's security clearance (as discussed in Part One last month), I would sug- gest, is the fact that Gordon Gray was running the day-to-day operation at the AEC clearance hearings. There had to be more to the matter than Oppenheimer's long-renounced prewar political leanings or his running argu- ment with Ed- ward Teller about the desir- ability of build- ing the H-bomb. ,--. T, , STH , . Don Durleson Those things themselves fall flat, without some darker reason in the background—some reason that had not been there in 1942, but was there by 1954. Here we recall the SSS (Smith- Sarbacher-Steinman) correspondence indicating Oppenheimer's early involve- ment in UFO crash retrieval operations. And we must note that as a member of MJ-12, Gordon Gray, officiating over the so-called Gray Board at the AEC hearings, would have known that Oppenheimer knew things classified \"higher than the H-bomb,\" things that he had not known in 1942 or even in 1945. Gray would have known that Oppenheimer was continuing to learn government secrets of unprecedented and unparalleled sensitivity. And in all likelihood, given the grow- ing independence of spirit Oppen- heimer was exhibiting over the Teller controversy, which would look alto- gether different when seen in the light of what Gordon Gray knew, Gray might well have found it prudent to recom- mend taking Oppenheimer out of the loop before his newfound waywardness took the form, possibly, of deciding that the public had a right to know about what had occurred at crash sites in New Mexico. JULY 2005 This is not to say that Oppenheimer ever really would have disclosed those things, which I doubt, but a conserva- tive-thinking MJ-12 member might have feared that he would. It has always been standard proce- dure, of course, to admonish anyone leaving the privileged ranks of security clearance holders not to talk about any- thing they know. Oppenheimer knew-and those offi- ciating over his situation knew-that his becoming an outsider would in no way alter his responsibility to maintain si- lence about classified information he had already learned. But those in power would also have wanted to prevent his learning any more than he already knew about so sensitive a matter as UFO crashes and retrievals, given that he was regarded in the end as a distinct security risk, whether justly or not. It is interesting, too, that when Oppenheimer was finally denied his clearance, and when, leaving govern- ment service forever to resume his po- sition as director of the Princeton In- stitute for Advanced Studies, AEC chief Lewis Strauss followed him there and attempted (unsuccessfully) to block his reappointment. This has all the flavor of a personal vendetta, quite possibly colored by whatever exchanges Strauss had with Gray over Oppenheimer's clearance, but one wonders why Strauss considered Oppenheimer so dangerous that he should not be allowed to function even in private life. When Strauss summed up his deci- sion against Oppenheimer at the end of the AEC hearings, he said, \"A Govern- ment official having access to the most sensitive areas of restricted data and to the innermost details of national war plans and weapons must measure up to exemplary standards of reliability, self- discipline, and trustworthiness\" (Polenberg, 380). When we read these comments in the light of the Sarbacher correspondence (which no one in 1954 knew would ever come to light), Strauss' choice of MUFON UFO JOURNAL About the author Dr. Burleson is New Mexico State Director for MUFON, a MUFON Research Specialist, and a Field In- vestigator. He holds masters degrees in math and English, and the Ph.D. in En- glish Literature. His Ph.D. disserta- tion led to a book, HP. Lorecraft, A Critical Study. Burleson's UFO books include The Golden Age of UFOs and UFOs and the Death of Marilyn Monroe. He has written articles for the In- ternational UFO Reporter (CUFOS) and the MUFON UFO journal. Burleson has done extensive re- search on the famous Ramey letter, utilizing sophisticated computer en- hancement. At one time he held a Top Secret security clearance in U.S. Air Force Intelligence as a Chinese language specialist. He is also fluent in Span- ish. words-\"the most sensitive areas of re- stricted data\"—tends to take on new meaning. One must assume that Strauss knew perfectly well that the subject of nuclear arms was not the \"most sensitive,\" though he may not have known the spe- cifics that Gray must have known. In any event, Strauss, Gray's boss, would in the end have been following up Gray's recommendations, however much or little Strauss himself knew of the UFO phenomenon. There are other indications that Oppenheimer's knowledge of highly secret matters ran far beyond those usu- ally cited. In his own initial response to the charges brought against him, Oppenheimer, referring to the postwar years circa 1947 at the old Manhattan Project facility in New Mexico, said, \"Los Alamos also had wide interests in scientific matters only indirectly related to the weapons program\" (Polenberg, 25).

I have had plenty of reason to confirm it, for I worked with him on many occasions on very difficult matters.\" (Polenberg, 203) Given that Bush was \"MJ-2,\" and that he was therefore up to his eyeballs in UFO-related missions, one has to wonder what those \"very difficult mat- ters\" were. It is worth noting that while two MJ- • 12 members were involved in the AEC hearings, one (Bush) supported Oppenheimer while one (Gray) did not. The difference, perhaps, is that Oppenheimer and Bush were fellow scientists; Gray was just a bureaucrat, though a very accomplished one, and could scarcely have had any profound understanding of Oppenheimer's mindset. Where scientists operate from a love of reason, politicians often operate from less felicitous impulses. It is obvious that Bush did everything he could, although to no avail in the end, to try to keep Oppenheimer cleared for Top Secret or higher, and this just might have been because his sense of Oppenheimer's value for future crash- retrieval activities would have out- weighed any sense of political doubt about Oppenheimer. On the other hand, it is natural to suppose that with Gray, who also must have known of Oppenheimer's involve- ment in UFO retrievals, it was the other way around. Gray, unlike Bush, was willing to see Oppenheimer go. How, specifically, was Oppenheimer involved in crash retrieval operations? The most detailed information appears to be in Steinman's book UFO Crash at A^tec. As Leonard Stringfield points out, writing the introduction to that book, it is unfortunate that Steinman has cho- sen in many cases for one reason or another not to name his sources, though Stringfield, needless to say a highly re- spected UFO investigator, would Oppenheimer scarcely have agreed to endorse the book had he not felt that Steinman's sources were legitimate. Indeed, Stringfield implies in the in- troduction that he himself knew who many of these sources were, even though the reader would not. Soon after the Aztec crash, Steinman writes, Gen. George C. Marshall (then secretary of state) assembled a military recovery team and also contacted MJ- 12 member Vannevar Bush, instructing him to organize a civilian scientific team as well. In addition to mathematician Dr. John von Neumann, Dr. Detlev Bronk (another MJ-12 member), Dr. Lloyd Berkner (another), Dr. Jerome Hunsaker (another), Dr. Carl Heiland, Dr. Horace Buele Van Valkenburgh, and others, Dr. Bush appointed Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer to the team. According to Steinman, Bush told them all to assemble as quickly as pos- sible at Durango (Colorado) Airfield, which is about 35 miles northeast of Aztec, NM, and thus about 24 miles from the impact site, telling them also that the mission was \"of the utmost se- crecy\" (Steinman, 31). The military recovery team, Steinman says, was from Camp Hale, CO, which was located west of Denver. My researches on Camp Hale show that the installation, which was deacti- vated in 1966, was used for secret CIA training operations from 1959 to 1965, and was in a remote location well suited to highly secret activities. In the unclassified literature on the place, no mention is ever made of the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit that Steinman says operated out of Camp Hale-a unit whose existence the Army MUFON UFO Journal Stringfield admitted in a document he provides— but then that would hardly be surpris- ing for so secret a group. Steinman says that Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientific team \"arrived on scene shortly after the IPU team got there. They went into immediate ac- tion, first checking for any possible ra- dioactivity. The ground and the disc- shaped machine were both gone over very carefully with Geiger counters.\" (Steinman, 35) He goes on to describe the scientific examination of the craft's interior, in- cluding \"control levels labeled in a hi- eroglyphic type symbol form unknown to any of the scientists in the team.\" He adds, \"Oppenheimer, who knew Sanskrit [this is firmly established as his- torical fact, by the way], made a remark that the symbols did resemble Sanskrit to some degree\" (Steinman, 38; he ac- tually uses the spelling \"Sanscrit\"), and mentions that cryptanalyst William Friedman would later be consulted, and that Dr. Bronk examined the alien bod- ies on site. Thus if Steinman's sources were au- thentic, as Stringfield seems to have felt they were, we have a firm connection of Oppenheimer with the UFO crash retrieval at Aztec. And while I have not seen similar documentation linking him with the re- trieval at Roswell, one would suppose that if the powers-that-be found it de- sirable to call him in for Aztec, they may well also have done so for Roswell. Indeed, it may be that Oppenheimer and some of the others were pulled in at Aztec precisely because they had ex- perience with the same sort of scenario dating from July 1947 in Roswell. I should mention here that Stanton JULY 2005"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Friedman interviewed Dr. Sarbacher in 1983 (Sarbacher died in 1986), and when Friedman remarked to Sarbacher, \"I'm very interested in the crash that hap- pened in 1947,\" and followed up by say- ing, \"and being New Mexico in 1947 one has to presume that probably Oppenheimer and Groves and those guys were involved,\" Sarbacher replied, \"Very likely.\" (See www.presidentialufo.com/ sarbacher-friedrnan.htm) Another document that tends to link Oppenheimer with an interest in UFOs is the so-called \"Oppenheimer-Einstein draft\" of June 1947, a sort of essay in which the authors explore the psychol- ogy, sociology, and politics of possible interactions between humankind and alien cultures. (Robert and Ryan Wood list this document on their website and give it a high authenticity rating.) The document is designated for sig- nature by Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer and Professor Albert Einstein. On the final page there is an adden- dum typed in that reads: \"Myself and Marshall have read this and I must ad- mit there is some logic. But I hardly think the President will consider it for the obvious reasons. I understand Oppenheimer approached Marshall while they attended ceremony at [por- tion redacted]. As I understand it Marshall rebuffed the idea of Oppenheimer discussing this with the President. I talked to Gordon, and he agreed. VB\" \\ Presumably \"VB\" is Vannevar Bush and \"Gordon\" is Gordon Gray. It is not clear whether President Truman indeed ever received this draft from its authors, but it appears that Gray knew of it in any case, so that we have yet another Oppenheimer-Gray-UFO con- nection. I have been at some pains here to indicate both the likelihood that Oppenheimer was involved in UFO in- vestigations, and that the reasons gen- erally given for the ultimate denial of his security clearance are awash in flimsy logic, precisely because I feel that it is important to get at what could well be the real reasons. My hypothesis is simple, but of far- reaching implications: Dr. Oppen- heimer's clearance was denied not so much because of his left-leaning politi- cal views or his reservations about the JULY 2005 development of the H-bomb as because of what AEC Personnel Security Board Chairman Gordon Gray, as a member of MJ-12, must have known about Oppenheimer's involvement in UFO matters far more sensitive than nuclear weaponry-an involvement that Gray must have thought it best to see discon- tinued. I believe that this hypothesis very tightly accounts for the known facts, and should be seriously considered until it is either disproven or replaced by some hypothesis that accounts for everything better. The simple fact is that the old logic does not work. If Oppenheimer's po- litical views and the like were going to be viewed as that detrimental, then he would never have been cleared to head up the Los Alamos project to build the atomic bomb to start with—so the AEC panel's excuses for denying his clearance make no sense. Unless, that is, one realizes that the panel was looking not just at Oppenheimer's knowledge of atomic weaponry in light of his doubtful po- litical views, but at his knowledge of things much more important—things that he had no knowledge of during the Los Alamos years, but did have knowl- edge of by 1954. Certainly, the UFO crash-retrieval activities of the late 1940s fit that de- scription. In any.event, one has to wonder why the still-secret portions of the Oppen 7 heimer AEC hearing transcripts have never been released, even half a cen- tury after the fact. Theoretically, there should be little or nothing in those tran- scripts still deserving to be classified. So why are portions of them still clas- sified? Could it be because there are references, in the testimony before the panel, to \"that flying saucer business in New Mexico\" or something of the sort? I hardly need point out how impor- tant even one such reference would be, if disclosed to the public and to the community of UFO researchers. I have submitted a Freedom of In- formation Act request for the release of the heretofore unseen portions of the transcripts, though I have little hope that they will be released any time soon. If my hypothesis is true, those tran- scripts could well contain references of immense importance to the field of UFO studies. So the point here is not just that Oppenheimer was royally \"shafted,\" though in my view he indeed was, or not just that he was involved in UFO investigation. The point here is that the real rea- sons for the government's treatment of him may, if spelled out in the hidden transcripts and if ever disclosed, bring us that much closer to the end of the grand UFO cover-up. Earth microbes might survive on Mars NASA reports that terrestrial mi- crobes that hitch a ride to Mars on spacecraft may be able to survive under special circumstances, according to a new laboratory study. The research suggests scientists should take extra care when analyzing potential signs of life during future mis- sions to the Red Planet. Most spacecraft that touch down on Mars have not been thoroughly steril- ized by heat or radioactivity, so they carry living microbes from Earth. But Mars's thin atmosphere allows such intense ultraviolet radiation to reach the planet's surface—triple that found on Earth—that any life inadvert- ently carried on the spacecraft is thought to be wiped out quickly. But now an international team has tested the endurance of a particularly hardy type of blue-green alga—or MUFON UFO JOURNAL cyanobacterium—that thrives in dry deserts from Antarctica to Israel. The resilient bacterium, called Chroococcidiopsis sp. 029, was chosen as a \"worst-case scenario\" for contami- nation of the planet. The team found that dormant spores of the bacterium had mostly died after five minutes of Martian UV exposure. However, the bacteria were able to stay alive if they were shielded by just 1 mil- limeter of soil during the tests. Under such a protective coating, the bacteria could survive and potentially grow if water and nutrient requirements for growth were met. • \"We think there are places on Mars where Earth life could make a living,\" says John Rummel, NASA's planetary protection officer in DC, who is charged with preventing microbes from contami- nating worlds beyond Earth."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Brazilian ufologists pause folloning a two-hour visit nith the military, \\jeft to right, A. ].

Brazilian military begins work with Brazilian ufology group By A. J. Gevaerd MUFON Representative, Brazil Editor, Brazilian UFO Magazine Head of the Brazilian Committee of UFO Researchers (CBU) gevaerd@ufo.com.bt Friday, May 20, was an historic day for ufology in Brazil and the world as the Brazilian Air Force (FAB) for the first time officially received a commit- tee of top UFO researchers to openly discuss sightings and fully examine clas- sified UFO documents in several mili- tary facilities in Brasilia, the capital. By doing this very important step, the Brazilian Air Force has placed Brazil in a very short list of countries whose mili- taries acknowledge ufology as a serious activity Brigadier Telles Ribeiro, chief of the Brazilian Air Force Communication Center, stated, \"We want to have all in- formation on the subject which has been withheld by us for some decades to be fully released to the public through the UFO community.\" The Brazilian Government, through the Brazilian Air Force, has thus finally decided to come forward and recognize UFO research as a genuine activity. This is a direct result of intense pres- sure made by the campaign called \"UFOs: Freedom of Information Now,\" a movement started by the Bra- %ilian UFO Magazine in April, 2004. 10 The campaign was launched by the Brazilian Committee of UFO Research- ers (CBU), composed of six UFO civil- ian researchers: Claudeir Covo, Marco Petit, Rafael Cury, Reginaldo de Athayde, Fernando Ramalho, and A. J. Gevaerd (Athayde was sick and replaced by new interim member veteran UFO researcher Roberto Affonso Beck dur- ing our visit). Details of the campaign, both in Por- tuguese and in English can be consulted at: www.ufo.com.br and www.ufo.com.br/secrecy.php The approach of the Brazilian mili- tary to the CBU committee started last February, ten months after the campaign began, with a phone call from a Brazil- ian Air Force spokesman, Maj. Anto- nio Lorenzo, and a formal invitation to visit the Air Force headquarters in Brasilia. Maj. Lorenzo fully recognized the UFO researchers' efforts in this field and provided a few details of the re- served files and procedures that the Bra- zilian Air Force has about die UFO phenomenon. Two meeting between the civilian UFO researchers and the military took place on May 20, the first at the head- quarters of the Integrated Center of Air Defense and Air Traffic Control, a very sensitive facility. During a two-hour visit the research- ers were given lectures of the proce- MUFON UFO Journal dures conducted at Cindacta, and had the opportunity to visit air traffic con- trol rooms and understand how UFOs could be detected by Air Force person- nel. The second and most important meeting took place just after this one at the very reserved facilities of Brazilian Air Defense Command, an even more sensitive installation that controls the entire air defense network, including the surrounding areas of the Atlantic Ocean and South America. In this facility the UFO researchers were given a full briefing of the top as- pects of aerial defense of the country. It was in this facility that its own com- mander, Brigadier Atheneu Azambuja, admitted to the UFO researchers how concerned the Brazilian military is about the UFO phenomenon. Azambuja also gave details of Air Defense procedures, and openly admit- ted that the country has systematically detected and registered UFOs in the country-labeled as \"H Traffic\"-since 1954. That wasn't a surprise for the UFO researchers, but how this registering process took place was. After this point of the visit, nothing could be filmed, taped, videoed, or even copied and transcripted.

The first case was an airplane pur- suit of a UFO in the ocean shores of Parana State. The second file was much more important. In the folder contain- ing the 1977 documents that could be examined by the UFO researchers were dozens of cases of UFOs in the Ama- zon—with an amazing amount of more dian 100 pictures made during the so- called Operation Saucer. This was an official program of UFO investigation by the military that took place from September to December, 1977, and has been fully covered by spe- cialized UFO press over the world. The third case was the \"The Official Night of UFOs in Brazil,\" a very sig- nificant group of events that happened in May, 1986, when 21 objects of over 100 m in diameter jammed Brazilian air traffic control systems over mainly Rio de Janeiro, Sao Jose dos Campos, and Sao Paulo. Several jets were sent to intercept the intruders—without any success. The Brazilian Air Force representatives at those meetings then fully admitted that ufology is serious business, and broadly recognized the activity of UFO research by the civilian UFO community. They also guaranteed diat further steps are about to be taken to let the researchers examine the entire military UFO files in a more comprehensive way. In addition, a committee of military and civilian UFO researchers was prom- ised to start operating very soon, coor- dinated by the Brazilian Committee of UFO Researchers (CBU). This certainly means diat we will start a new era in ufology in Brazil and in South America. Very good things are about to hap- pen as the Brazilian Air Force com- mand, the Brazilian Ministry of De- fense, and Brazilian President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva receive the letters and formal requests for opening for good these documents and starting the military-civilian committee.

The sky was overcast with low ceiling, and it was just after a rain. The road was freshly washed and clear of tire tracks. I had just left my neighbor's house and was driving my pet car, which only has park- ing lights. As I came to die end of their drive- way I noticed a blue cast on the road and on the trees opposite me across Crystal Lake road. I then looked up die road to my right and saw in the distance what I took to be a large RV or SUV with a light rack. The lights were of unusual color, and I assumed diis was a new vehicle widi some new kind of lights. It is not unusual for hunters to be out spotting deer in this area, especially at this time of night. So I thought I would sit at the end of my neighbor's driveway and let diem come past—as diey were probably drinking and widi loaded guns. I waited for over 10 minutes as the lights slowly came down die road, which was a downhill slant. I assumed they were coasting as I couldn't hear die en- gine running. It was at this time diat I began to feel something was very odd about die whole thing. For one, although the lights were extremely intense, there was no discernable reflection of the lights' beam on the road or on the trees-just a pale blue cast, much like moonlight. Another diing diat I noticed was diat die large vehicle covered die entire widdi of die road. Lasdy, die object cruised down die road smoodily, and this was a terribly bad washboard gravel road. It was at this point I thought UFO!!! But I also thought, \"No, that's too good to be true. It must be a truck of some sort.\" I still could not see die vehicle be- hind the lights. It was at this point diat I decided to pull out on the road facing diem and cruise slowly up to my drive- way, which was next door some 500 feet up the road in the approaching direc- tion of the lights. I drove slowly up to my own drive- way and pulled in past die large trees, blocking me from their sight. I noticed too that when I was behind die tree I could not even tell diere were any lights on die road, even diough diey were now only some 300 feet distant and the lights were the most intense I have ever seen on a vehicle, except possibly landing lights on a major airliner So I stepped out from behind die tree and saw diat die lights were still com- ing down die road slowly towards me. It was now some 100 feet from me. I JULY 2005 MUFON UFO JOURNAL 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"looked directly at it as it came towards me. I still could not see beyond the lights, and there was no sound. However, at this point I could see that there was no undercarriage to the thing!! It had, in- stead, a blue circle of light which pro- jected on the road beneath it. I had said my whole life that if I ever saw a UFO I would approach it directly. Now here it was, and yet I stood there for over 10 minutes before I decided to move at all. It had stopped about 100 feet from me and waited. My thoughts were racing...This was my moment...! would never forgive myself if I ran, or backed away, or did nothing. I thought, I'm a Christian; surely God would stand with me. I thought they are observing me, an alien creature from Earth, and what I am going to do. They just sat there, and amazingly no cars came along as they usually do this time of night. (All our neighbors were at the Ca- sino, and they usually come drifting home this time of night) Call It melodrama or not, but it took everything I had just to step out into the middle of the road and face the lights. I held my arms up and slowly turned around to show that I had no weapons. Then, arms up, I slowly walked to- wards the lights straight up the middle of the road. I had gotten to within 50 feet or so, and now I could begin to see some of the structure behind the lights. I could see the ends protruding over the edge of the road about three feet on ei- ther side. I walked like someone in a wedding march, slow and very deliberate. I never took,my eyes off those lights. The object then began to move back- wards up the road in pace with my walk. It did this until it became opposite my neighbor's driveway, and then it stopped. I continued slowly walking, and had gotten within 25 feet of the object when it suddenly shot sideways through the gap in the trees made by my neighbor's driveway on the right. \\ It was about 30 feet wide and over 10 feet to the top of the thing, and it just left, in an instant with a phhhhhhffffffttttt!!! Sound. That is the only sound it ever made. I want to describe the incredible method in which it departed. I was 20 or so feet from it, and it departed side- 12 ways so fast that I could not visibly follow its motion, other than to see that it took off to the right and instantly disappeared before my eyes. Other than the sound I de- scribed, it was totally silent, and there was no force in the air to tell me that it had left. Nothing. Absolute silence, and the air was motionless. When it left, I marked the gravel where I stood to be able to measure the distance between the UFO (as I now knew that's what it was) and myself where I last stood. I then went back to my car and raced up the driveway where it had disap- peared. This is a dead end drive, and I stopped to ask the neighbor children there if anyone had come in there, and they said no one had. I then went back to my neighbors where I had been originally and tried to wake them. The wife came to the door and saw that I was very excited. I told her that I had seen a UFO, and she just looked at me quizzically and said come over in the morning. I then went back to my house, got a flashlight and a tape measure, and walked back out to the road. I checked for tracks in the gravel road, where it had been, had left, and had come from up the road. It was just after a rain, and the only tracks in the road were mine from the car, and my footprints in the gravel. However, on the road, rocks up to the size of my fist were slid sideways for up to four or more feet to either side.of the road. There, at the spot in the road where it departed were only my tracks, and the same rocks slid outwards in every di- rection. I then measured the mark in the road where I last stood facing the UFO up to the place where the UFO had been. It measured 22 feet. I went into my stu- dio and stayed up all might creating a detailed drawing on scratchboard while everything was fresh in my mind. I should like to add that I had looked at my watch when I left my friend's house that night because I normally do not visit that late. It was two minutes to 12, and when the sighting was over I also checked my watch, and it was 12:38. 1 did this to consciously record the time. MUFON UFO Journal There was a sunburn that developed on my face, arms, and legs (I had on shorts at the time). There was never any redness or swelling, but there was the burning sensation like a sunburn, and it lasted about three weeks. The other unusual thing that I no- ticed was a dead skunk that I had run down the day before this encounter. It lay at the side of the road near my mail box. The next morning after the sighting, I walked out to the road and noticed that there was something unusual about the skunk. The smell was gone, and af- ter a minute, I noticed what was wrong. Where the skunk had lain was a wet spot, and the hair follicles lay in perfect order, even outlining the white mark- ings, but there was absolutely no flesh or bone!!! Subsequent events were: 1. The sighting of a small red dot about the size of a dime moving about the kitchen in the dark. I chased it, and it dove towards the floor and up to the top of the outside door and went seem- ingly through it. This was four nights later, and occurred at about 3 AM, Aug. 4. 2. On Aug. 14 at 3 AM I awoke to see a round disc with a swirling blue and pink center. There was a ring of diamond-like lights around the rim of the thing. It disappeared as I sat up. I noticed an acid type burning sensation on my arm, but went back to bed. The next morning I brought up the subject with my neighbor, and he pointed out that the acid burn on my arm was a perfect triangle. It lasted for three months, burning with the same in- tensity. Now, over two years later, it still can be clearly seen. 3.

I had heard a drumming noise above the house, and heard noises on the roof, but saw nothing. The next morning diere was a round spot behind my house about 500 feet from my neighbor's back yard. It was a depression in the new growth of young trees that was 30 feet in diameter, and the trees were twisted into a spiral. 4. On Sept 4 my neighbor and I were driving home when he noticed some- thing pacing us to my right. I didn't see anything at first, but then he pointed up above the trees and I saw six golden discs turn their flat surfaces to us re- flecting the sun. They moved in an un- dulating motion up and down as they paced along with us for over ten miles. They moved as If they were tied to- gether. Then they flipped to the hori- zontal and sped up into the clouds. The time was about 6 PM-sunset. 5. On Nov. 6 in the night about 11 PM my neighbor and I were walking a path in the woods some 600 feet dis- tant behind my house when we saw a red ball of light circle my house about 15 feet off the ground. We both saw it dearly. It went behind my house and was not seen again. There was nothing at the house. 6. On Dec. 15 or so, I was away, vis- iting relatives, when my neighbors saw bright lights come on inside my house. One neighbor converged on the house from one side, and the other neighbor drove in from the other side to catch the vandals. It had just snowed recently, and my driveway had no tracks in the snow. When they pulled up to the house the lights suddenly went out. There were no tracks in the snow, and no one inside. I had my main fuse box shut off at the pole, so there was no electricity. 7. Lastly, on Dec. 26 at about mid- night, my neighbors called to say they (several in the group) saw a huge red glowing ball of light slowly go across the tree tops and glide over my house, then shoot up into the sky at a 45-de- gree angle. I was in the house, but no- ticed nothing unusual. So that's it. I believe that's everything. I have the dates because after the first experience I kept a book on anything unusual that happened. I moved out to Washington that January, just to get back on an even keel, as it were. JULY 2005 MUFON Forum Scientists and UFOs We thank Paul Von Ward for his in- terest in ourJBIS article reprinted in the MUFON Journals of January and Feb- ruary, and also the editor, Dwight Connelly, for having reprinted it (\"Four experts explain why scientists should study the UFO phenomenon\" by Dr. James Deardorff, Dr. Bernard Haisch, Dr. Bruce Maccabee, and Dr. H.E. Puthoff). Von Ward took issue with two state- ments. One was that ET behavior is consistent with... \"the fact that not in the past 56 years, nor in past millennia, have we been colonized, conquered or exterminated, nor has society been traumetized by any ETs.\" He pointed out that beings more ad- vanced than humans have intervened in human society far into the distant past. In speaking for myself and Bruce Maccabee, we tend to agree with him on this, and so our words did not ex- clude such intervention. Instead, our intent was to mention the obvious fact that any such interven- tion never reached a stage where the human race itself was colonized or ex- terminated. The other statement was \"it appears all too evident that ETs have not inter- vened in world affairs in any benevo- lent manner that would have forestalled human warfare, famine and disease.\" To this, Von Ward objected with two examples, one being that reports of credible witnesses conflict with this. However, our statement here referred to world affairs and not to individuals. We agree with him that many indi- viduals have been cured of various in- firmities through alien intervention, as we made explicit reference to the book by Dennett & Dennett on this. His second example was to the strong ( warning supplied to Noah about the flood to come and how to build the ark. Von Ward's implication is that this warn- ing came from an ET, not \"God.\" We admit not having thought of the Flood in this context, and only point out here that supposedly only a tiny frac- tion of the population of the region in- . MUFON UFO JOURNAL volved was saved, the rest being non- benevolently doomed, and that after this event human warfare, famine and dis- ease continued to occur. It should be clear, however, that in a journal paper of limited length, directed towards why scientists should study UFOs, the scope of our argumentation had to be severely curtailed, and so we dared not raise the topic of religions nor even that of the abduction phenom- enon. -Jim Deardorff Kentucky call to action I noticed that in the April issue of the Journal that MUFON's Missions and Goals were listed. Having not read them myself in quite awhile, I decided to brush up on them. After reading them, however, I de- cided that in my state a call to action is sorely needed. Of the three goals, investigate UFO sightings, promote research, and edu- cate the public, I realized that Kentucky MUFON only gets about one third of the equation right. Our state has always had more focus on educating the public; we are not com- pleting the rest of the equation very well. People of Kentucky, this your call to action. We need more investigators. As of right now, we have only one—yours truly. We have a need for researchers. Edu- cators, please step forward. We need your help as well. Help us get the word out to the public. Also to those of you who may be on the fence about membership, why not join us? I know that there are some of you out there who are interested in help- ing with investigations and taking the MUFON field investigator test. I am asking all of the wonderful and talented people of Kentucky to not be afraid to share your unique abilities and talents with this organization.

Like many experiences, both Hayley and Joy felt much anxiety and many doubts about their encounters. For many UFO experiences and in- vestigators, the emotional trauma can vacillate between suppression and awareness, between acceptance and ac- knowledgment of these experiences. Fear of insanity, or loss of personal identity, can lead to denial and/or ad- dictive behaviors to ease the uncertainty. As a competent and caring clinician, Dr. Colli is able to sail her ship of psy- chotherapeutic alliance between ScyLla and Charybdis: the dangerous \"rock\" of denying debunkers on the one hand and 14 the dangerous \"whirlpool\" of psycho- pathology on the other hand. She describes with clarity and com- passion her interactions with Hayley and Joy. Both women were able to appre- hend and release their fears, and also move into higher realms of intellectual understanding, emotional acceptance, and spiritual awareness. In addition to these detailed investi- gations, Dr. Colli provides her readers with references to many authors and many studies, not only of other UFO investigations, but also of psychologi- cal studies of memory and stress. She refers to the DSM-FV (Diagnos- tic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), as well as the meditative practices of Asian spiritual masters. The author is able to use her training in philosophy as a \"shield\" to defend against the caustic complaints of crit- ics; she is able to use her training in psy- chology as a \"sword\" to seek and find the truth of close encounters. Eventually, Dr. Colli, as well as Hayley, lay down the sword and shield as Joy surrenders to Unity Conscious- ness: in essence, the easing and ending of duality/polarity as Joy experiences Oneness with All. In 1901, a Canadian psychiatrist, Maurice Buck, M.D, wrote of his inves- tigations of persons who experienced Cosmic Consciousness. More recently, an American psychia- trist, David R. Hawkins, M.D., Ph.D., has calibrated levels of consciousness in his 1995 book, Power vs. Force. Dr. Hawkins has shown that consciousness can be measured. Dr. Colli assists her readers not only to explore Higher Consciousness, but she also responds well to the perennial question about the motives of \"aliens\": \"good\" or \"evil\"? She states, \"Ulti- mately, the answer lies in fostering our own expansion of consciousness\" (p. 289). Whether the reader is concerned about Earth and Humanity, or con- cerned about ET (extraterrestrial) en- MUFON UFO Journal counters, the reading of Sacred Encoun- ters can be an opportunity for enlight- enment. The reader can learn from the phi- losophy, the psychology, and the trans- formation of individuals and society through these interactions with aliens/ demons/angels/ETs, who are interven- ing in our human history. Dr. Colli provides this opportunity with her scholarship, her expertise, and her inner light of spiritual development. Illinois women report close sighting of object By Phil Bloomer Champaign, IL, News-Gazette A curious news item from a January 1967 edition of the Villa Grove News has popped up in the newsroom concern- ing a UFO sighting near Camargo. It was approximately 7:45 PM on Jan. 7, 1967. Mrs. Dwight McCumber and her friend Cathy (Shearer) Bundy were on the way home from the movies .in Villa Grove. Mrs. McCumber's 18-year-old daughter also was in the car. They were a quarter-mile from the Shearer house, east of Camargo, when they noticed a strange light above the back door. The light was hovering, with no discernible shape, just lights. They stopped the car, and what had been a bright light moved closer and changed to a fuzzy light, then two flash- ing red lights. It stopped across the road from them and changed to a white light, still hovering at about the height of a telephone pole. Mrs. McCumber turned off the ra- dio and rolled down the window. Daughter Jeanette got out and yelled up, 'Take me to your leader?\" It then moved off to the west. Mrs. McCumber said she was more awestruck than scared—until her daugh- ter did that. \"Then I was scared. I thought they might take her away.\" They didn't. The McCumbers have lived nor- mal lives, and she just turned 80.

Alabama triangles MONTGOMERY - A security of- ficer on patrol near the downtown area at 2:45 AM on May 25, 2005, noticed two strange objects flying above him. They had strobe lights that emanated along the entire length of all three sides of each object, as well as three large pulsing lights under the bottom of each object. He states, \"I noticed a low humming noise coming from the triangles that were flying at about 10,000 feet altitude. The objects moved slowly at first, al- most seeming to hover, and after about 20 seconds they exited to the west in a burst of speed that I can only describe as almost instantaneous. 'The objects then stopped again and were only visible as two pulsing lights at that point. The objects again moved to the west and disappeared completely. \"The objects maintained exact dis- tance from each other during this entire time, and the altitude of the objects did not seem to change during this sight- ing. The event lasted about 30 seconds.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, director, www.UFOcenter.com. Washington black triangle KIRKLAND - On May 13, 2005, at 12:19 AM a black triangle with nine or- ange to yellowish lights on two sides of the triangle was seen by the witness. There was a center tight at the front tip of the craft, with four lights follow- ing each leading edge for a total of nine lights. No lights were observed on the stern or rear of the triangle. The color of the lights was a very light salmon/orange yellow. The lights glowed with barely detectible movement similar to air heating phenomena which you see on heated roadways, but in this JULY 2005 case the area was confined to the lights. The witness says, \"I discovered the craft due east in my field of view, and the craft was traveling north. I estimate the craft was 3 A to 1 mile from my posi- tion. I estimate altitude at 200-350 feet, traveling at 70-110 knots, and banking- more like floating—towards the left. 'The craft leveled off, traveling to- wards the NE, and became un- detectable as it became level, in perfect stealth. \"Unlike satel- lites, which float in an arc across the sky, this craft floated in a straight line close the earth. The size of the craft was as big as a 747, or at least 3 /4 of a football field.\" Thanks to Russ Hamerly. George Filer Kentucky stationary disc INDEPENDENCE - While driving to work near 1-75 on May 1, 2005, at 6:20 AM the witness noticed a metallic object hovering in the sky about half a mile away. It was somewhat disc-shaped with a tall dome or arch on top. It was silent and totally still. The wit- ness explains, \"I drove towards it to see if it was a helicopter; it wasn't. It was totally silent, no lights of any kind, and I was close enough to confirm that it was nothing familiar. \"It flew smoothly like glass. I watched it from a parking lot and tried to get pictures on my cell phone, but the reso- lution was too poor. It got smaller, so I drove after it and pulled into another parking lot about 1/4 mile away and watched it until it got real small. \"It was heading to the southeast, and must have been going pretty fast. It had at least two bent poles or \"arms\" com- ing off the sides, like the probes on a space shuttle.\" Thanks to Peter Daven- port. MUFON UFO JOURNAL Maine cigar-shaped object CUMBERLAND - \"I was at a party at 1 AM on May 9, 2005, with four of my friends from college,\" says the wit- ness. 'There were tons of stars because there were no clouds, and we were hav- ing a barbecue and relaxing. \"I kept noticing this particular star that seemed to stand out from the rest that looked like it was moving. I turned around to point it out to my friends, and it moved much closer to us in just five seconds. Its speed was incredible. \"After it got to us at such mind-blow- ing speeds, it slowed to about 10 miles an hour, hovering right above the trees that were about 20 feet away from us. These trees are about 50 feet tall, so we had an amazing view of this cigar- shaped ship. \"It had five intensely bright lights on the bottom that were all white, except the one in the middle which was a less bright yellow color. When the object completely stopped above the trees the middle yellow light became more intense than the white ones and flickered on and off twice. \"It was a solid object, because the lights on the bottom reflected off its silver metallic surface. It covered up most of the stars and was at least 65 feet long and about 25 feet wide. It lit • up the trees as it hovered. 'The white lights on the bottom of the craft were intense. The center yel- low light turned light blue, and the craft sped off at an amazing speed. \"We were actually kind of spooked, and off in the distance we saw two other ships on the left and right sides of the cigar-shaped craft. They rose up from the thick woods, and then all five sped away in formation.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Florida glowing orbs ORANGE COUNTY - Roberta Puhalski writes, \"On April 22, 2005, about 11 PM, the Georgia UFO Group Hotline received a cell phone call from 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"just north of Orlando where three Or- ange County fishermen had just ob- served at 20 yards a glowing orb type of UFO. \"The orb performed incredible ma- neuvers at a fantastic speed. They were so shocked; they phoned 411 and asked for the operator to get them in touch with any UFO investigator that could be found.\" They reached Tom Sheets of GUFOG in Fayetteville, GA, who turned the case over to Roberta Puhalski, the founder of the Central Florida UFO Group in Lakeland. Roberta Puhalski met with the three witnesses at the event site two days later and conducted a complete investigation. She determined that the witnesses, while night fishing and shining a flashlight, had observed what was initially thought to be an alligator's eye reflecting their flash- light beam about 20 yards away in some bushes. Suddenly the light rose up from the bushes into full sight at an alarmingly fast speed and was observed to be a dimly glowing orangish-red orb about the si2e of a basketball. The orb continued to rise at this very fast rate until it reached an altitude of about 150 feet, then it hovered, moved to the side about 100 feet, and came back down, tracing something like a tri- angle in it's flight path. The object moved so fast it was dif- ficult for the eye to follow. There ap- peared to be an object of unknown size and shape behind or attached to the orb, but it was difficult to see exactly what it was (due to the rapid speed and brief period of flight). This object flew off and vanished af- ter returning closer to the ground. Puhalski found these witnesses credible, forthright, and cooperative.

The first three were flying in a trian- gular formation, with two others follow- ing behind, perfectly aligned. They all flew at the same speed, and were headed east. \"It took about 3-5 seconds for the objects to leave,\" says the witness. \"My wife was with me and saw everything I am describing.\" Thanks to Peter Dav- enport. Oklahoma triangle chased NOBLE - This report was sent by a competent, educated scientist of sound mind and character, who never reported anything like this before: \"At 11:30 PM on May 27,2005, while taking my nightly walk, I observed a tri- angular craft traversing the sky from north to south at about 20,000 feet on a clear night. The craft's speed was about 500 knots, and several miles behind was a fighter jet moving very rapidly, 600 to 700 knots. Both craft were flying toward my position. I could begin to hear the engines of the jet at that time. \"It appeared the triangular craft was toying with the fighter, and when the fighter got close, the craft would speed up. As the two got nearly directly over my location, the triangular craft made a sharp right hand turn toward the west, but die jet was unable to make the sharp turn and made a much wider loop. \"After a few seconds, the triangle ac- celerated dramatically and left the jet be- hind. One thing diat was odd about the triangular craft was that the three lights making up the triangular pattern were not equal in distance. \"Referencing the wingspan of die jet, two of the lights on the craft were about 50 to 75 feet apart, and the third light was 100 to 150 feet from die odier two lights. Additionally, the two lights closer together were at the front, and die other furdier away light was at the rear facing die pursuing jet. \"This made die craft appear to be moving in reverse. The color of die tri- angular craft lights was an unusual milky white color, nothing like die very bright red, green, and white lights observed on die jet.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport.

In 1954, near March Field, CA, three witnesses driving a late model car ob- served a shiny circular object on the ground. They stopped the car and ap- proached the object. They saw a \"being\" who raised his arm and projected what appeared to be a fireball at the vehicle. The fire- ball passed by the men and struck their vehicle. The witnesses fled, the object ascended, and when they re- turned to the car they found the paint burnt and a large dent. On March 9,1966, Donnela Banning was driving toward Baytown, TX, with her mother, Mrs. Doyle Havard, and Debbie Carrico. At 7:45 PM Debbie yelled, \"Look.\" Ms. Banning reports: \"As I looked there it was. It looked like it was com- ing through the windshield. It hit with a thump and an explosion.\" The object was dark and the size of a bowling ball. The explosion was loud enough to bring people out of their houses some distance from the car. Harris County Sheriff's Department accident investigator Roland Kingsley said that whatever hit the car did $50 to $100 damage to the roof of the vehicle. The roof was dented and the paint was knocked off the metal, although the metal was not cut. Kinsley searched the area, but could find no fragments. It should be noted that the car was on an overpass, and no one was standing along the highway. In Kent, OH, on March 28, 1967, David Morris was driving home at 2:20 18 AM when he saw a reddish-orange cone-shaped object 25 feet off the left side of the road. The object was 12 feet wide at the base, which was slightly off the ground. The object tapered to a point 25 feet high, where there was a ball. Several small beings were on the road, and Morris claimed he hit one of them. He fled the area, and when he stopped down the road, found three dents in the front bumper and right headlight ring. On July 13, 1967, in Maumee, OH, Robert Richardson and Jerry Quay were driving around a bend in the road when they saw a large brilliant blue-white light completely blocking the road. Richardson, the driver, braked and swerved to avoid hitting the light. Both men closed their eyes as they felt the impact of a collision. They reported the incident to the Ohio State Police, who went back to the site to investigate. The hood of the car and the bumper had been damaged. On July 17,1967, in Miller ton, NY, a 13 cm object approached an automo- bile from the opposite direction. The car experienced EM effects, and the wind- shield was shattered. On Nov. 27, 1998, in Mt. Clemens, MI, a young woman was driving home when a sphere the si2e of a basketball was seen flying just above the road sur- face from the opposite direction. The sphere was spinning and emitting sprays of light. The object impacted the car roof on the passenger side over the front door, then flew on, leaving a two-foot long area of a creamy-gray colored residue. On Dec. 29, 2002, in Benson, NC, Linda Moore was driving her new Toyota when an object hit the passen- ger side of her car. Mrs. Moore's cousin, Vicki Wright, was in the front passenger seat, and Mrs. Moores two nieces were in the back seat. Vicki said she saw a black object travel- ing at high speed which approached the car from above a tall pine tree. The object impacted the vehicle just in front of the side mirror. The 14-year- MUFON UFO Journal old niece also saw the object approach- ing. The object gouged a large dent in the car and scratched off paint. No frag- ments were found at the site. A classic case of vehicle impact oc- curred on Aug. 27,1979, near Stephen, MN, involving a police car. Deputy Sheriff Val Johnson was driv- ing his patrol car near the North Da- kota border when at 1:40 AM he ob- served a bright white light through his side window. He contacted dispatch and proceeded to move closer. He estimated the dis- tance to the light at about 1.5 miles. Suddenly the light moved toward him, reaching the patrol car in one or two seconds. The light was so intense that Johnson was blinded. He heard glass breaking and lost consciousness. When he re- gained consciousness, he found the car stalled, and saw that it had skidded across the highway with the front wheels off the pavement. He was able to call dispatch 39 min- utes after the first observation of the light source. Another deputy arrived in minutes and called for an ambulance. The doctor found Johnson in a mild state of shock. His eyes were irritated as if he had suffered \"mild welder's burns.\" Johnson couldn't stand expo- sure to any bright lights. Police found that the car had trav- eled 950 feet after the first impact, as indicated by the location of glass from the headlight. The inside headlight on the left side was heavily damaged, while the headlight 2 inches to the left was not. There was a flat-bottomed circular dent on the left side of the hood. The dent was 12.5 mm in diameter, and close to the windshield. The windshield directly in front of the driver was heavily damaged from top to bottom. The roof antenna was bent at a 60- degree angle at a point 6 inches above its spring-loaded base. The trunk an- tenna was bent at a 90-degree angle at a point 6 inches below the top. Both an- JULY 2005"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"tennas had spring-loaded bases. The electric dash clock was 14 min- utes slow, as was Johnson's mechanical wristwatch. The deputy had set both clocks before starting his shift. A report released by Sheriff Dennis Brekke after a lengthy investigation found the following: Intense light: \"First, it occurred in the shape of a beam, then became over- whelmingly bright. The beam-like shape of the light suggests an unnatural source.\" Glass breakage: 'There are definite signs of impact. The direction of the impacting media is evident from the lo- cation of breakage and imprint in the hood. The relative angle of attack on the car is near horizontal.\" Engine stoppage: \"The stoppage was not due to mechanical failure, as evi- denced by the fact that the car func- tioned normally following the incident. The engine stoppage points heavily to temporary disruption of the electrical system.\" Driver unconscious for a period up to 40 minutes: \"It is not clear whether the bump on the head could have caused this or if other 'phenomena' might be the source. \"In order to function, the body's ner- vous system relies on electro-chemical signals. Could there have been disrup- tion of this by electrical means?\" Malfunction of the automobile clock and wristwatch: \"This was of a tempo- rary nature, much as the engine failure. Disruption of the electrical clock could very well coincide with the failure of the engine electrical system. The failure of the mechanical wrist- watch would, of necessity, be of a dif- ferent form; but again, the temporary nature suggests a 'malfunction' that dis- sipates.\" Bent antennas: \"Considerable effort was made to solve the problem of the bent antennas. The metal hardness tells us that they were not exposed to a gen- eral high temperature that caused bend- ing. \"Normally, an antenna subjected to a uniform force would bend at the base. However, on a car traveling 60-65 MPH the antennas are flexed toward the rear. A force from above, superimposed on the flexed antennas, could bend the parts in the manner exhibited. \"As no impact marks are evident, the force must have been of a relatively JULY 2005 MUFON International Director John Schuessler, left, and MUFON Business Board Member Clifford Clift, right, recently briefed Senator Wayne A Hard on MUFON's activities in Colorado and na- tiomtide. uniform kind—that is, not from a series of particle impacts. The kinds of phe- nomena capable of performing this bending includes electrical, fluid (air).\" Discussion: \"The best fit describes a highly charged electrical 'thing' with enough mass and momentum to create the effects. \"The question arises whether natu- ral phenomena such as lightning (ball or otherwise) could likely cause all these happenings. Two factors discount this. \"One, the sustained horizontal beam- like appearance of the light (unlike light- ning) and the need for mass to accom- plish the events. \"The disruption of the electrical sys- tems points heavily to something elec- trical in nature, and certainly enough force must be generated to bend the antennas. Super strong electrical fields can produce these effects. \"My advisor on electrostatic forces indicates that an electrical field capable of producing the forces involved would be of an intensity to cause arcing to the car. The round ball on the one antenna is 'cleaned' as if this may have happened. \"The source of these effects is, of course, speculative. We live in an age that tells us there likely are civilizations more advanced than us. We, as a civilization, are accomplishing extensive space travel. We know how to utilize intense electri- cal fields for accelerating particles or producing forces. Of course, there is much we don't understand.\" These are but a few of the UFO-re- lated vehicle events resulting in measur- able physical evidence. I would greatly appreciate any addi- tional reports of this nature, as well as additional information on any of the cases related here.

Frankly I am sick and tired of being asked about various supposed UFO whistleblowers who are spreading their supposedly insider wisdom about what the US government supposedly knows about UFOs. The history of ufology has had many that turned out to be as phony as a three- dollar bill. Back in the 1960s there was \"Dr.\" Frank Stranges who talked about a stranger in the Pentagon named Segnarts (note that this is Stranges spelled backwards!). Frank tried many cons over the years, even staging a big conference in Ana- heim at which astronaut Gary Powers and William Shatner were supposedly going to make appearances. He con- vinced NBC in Hollywood to treat these claims seriously because they thought his group NICUFO was really NICAP. I spoke with the station, noting that I had checked and found none of the stars were coming, and noted that I had also spoken with his parole officer. He served time for smuggling a planeload'of marijuana. The station apologized to the public. Frank's PhD was supposedly from a theological semi- nary. He was a space age evangelist. Another famous con man from back then (and still sometimes turning up) was Mel Noel, who then became Guy Kirkwood, but who was really Noel Bryce Cornwall. He had supposedly graduated from the elite Cheshire Academy in Connecti- cut, went into the Air Force, and be- came a jet pilot whose job it was to pho- tograph UFOs. He showed pictures of him standing in front of a military jet! Later he sup- posedly flew DC-8s for United Airlines, etc etc. He had been exposed by Bobby Ann Slate Gironda and Fritz Kron in FATE Magazine many years ago as hav- ing admitted on a TV program that he had never been an AF Pilot. A Life Magazine reporter checked with the Air Force. Under none of his names had he been an AF pilot. I did some 20 Stan Friedman more checking and found he had a po- lice record, only attended the prestigious Cheshire Academy for a couple of months, and had only a private pilot's license for single engine aircraft-though the DC-8 has 4 big engines. He couldn't find his Air Line Pilots Association membership card, probably because the United Repre- sentative with ALPA never heard of him, even though United is a union airline. He also claimed to Linda Howe that he would provide his DD-214 (Mili- tary discharge paper) after he replaced it. It had been in a box of papers mat fell off a truck when he was moving. And my dog ate my homework. Of course he never found it. Also he stated he had never gone to college at a time when one needed at least two years in an air cadet program or a college degree to become a USAF pilot. Frank Kaufmann claimed he was part of a supersecret government insider group of nine when he was directly in- volved with recovering the Roswell crashed saucer in 1947. Kevin Randle and others who had supported his tales have now acknowledged he was mak- ing it all up. Milton William Cooper, a really nasty rightwinger (inspiration of Oklahoma City Bomber Timothy McVeigh) made all sort of claims about being a briefing officer for the Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet, reading classified docu- ments about MJ-12, etc, but couldn't even pick out his CINCPAC guy from a list I gave him. He had been a hydraulics mechanic in the USAF, and then an E-6 in the MUFON UFO Journal Navy without any college background. Not likely a briefing officer. He also falsely accused Budd Hopkins, Bruce Maccabee, and me of working for the CIA. Yes, I once worked for the US Government I delivered mail in Linden, NJ, in 1952 during Christ- mas vacation for two weeks while a sophomore at Rutgers University. He also published in his book Behold a Pale Horse the \"Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion,\" a virulently anti-semitic tract, without noting that it had been shown to be fraudulent many times. More recently I keep getting asked about Dr. Steve Greer's Disclosure Project. Hundreds of whistleblowers have come forth to support Steve. There was a large press conference highlight- ing their testimony at the Washington Press Club. People ask me why I am not a major supporter of Steve's efforts to get the government to come clean, since I of- ten talk about the Cosmic Watergate. I have met Steve and am suspicious of his agenda. He is charismatic and quite success- ful at raising funds. He was promoting a weekend with him for a limited group of supporters to whom he would tell everything. It would only cost $600, and they would have to sign a non-disclo- sure agreement. A little strange for somebody pushing disclosure. Also I found he was not using the government's own documents, \"Blue Book Special Report 14,\" the Condon Report, or The Congressional hearings of 1968 to make his case. Nor was he using the blacked out NSA UFO and CIA UFO documents and the whited out NSA UFO docu- ments to make an official case for the coverup-nor the Bolender memo stress- ing that reports which could effect na- tional security were not part of the Blue Book system. Much worse, from my viewpoint, was his claim that the government has back engineered free energy devices from crashed saucers and is withholding them JULY 2005"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"from the world when they could help solve all of the world's problems. He did have some investments he was rec- ommending. No evidence has been pro- vided. Why mix the two cover-ups even if both are real? I also discovered their lack of verifi- cation when one of his people ap- proached me about using \"Dr.\" Michael Wolf Kruvant (1941-2000) as one of his whistleblowers. I asked if they had checked his cre- dentials-a total of six advanced degrees, including PhDs in theoretical physics from both MIT and California Institute of Technology, a medical degree from McGill University (before the physics degrees), a law degree from Georgetown, etc. In addition, he had been a USAF colonel, a jet pilot in Vietnam, and an advisor to President Clinton on classi- fied matters. He could verify that Bob Lazar was telling the truth about Area 51, etc. I was informed that they had checked with the New York Academy of Science and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which both revealed that he had listed all these de- grees on his applications. I said how about first-hand checking of the claims. They had done none. I checked and found not only no veri- fication of any, but that neither the NYAS nor the AAAS had checked ei- ther. Pay your money and here is your card. I think they must have thought the NYAS was the National Academy of Sciences, which is a self electing group with very prestigious members. I did check and found he had none of the degrees. He had flunked out of Upsala College, had spent time in a mental hospital, and lived in a tiny apart- ment in Hartford until his death in 2000. I spoke with his brother, sister, and three old friends. He lived in a fantasy world. He claimed to be emeritus head of the New England Institute of Ad- vanced Research, which, he claimed in one of many conversations we had, sup- posedly had 75 employees. He wouldn't give either the tides or names or thesis advisors for his PhD degrees. None of the several Connecti- cut State agencies I contacted could find any record of the institute. He had told Dunn and Bradstreet about the institute. They did a field in- vestigation at my request. There was JULY 2005 If U.S. Neil's says so, it must be true. no sign of such an organization. I have a piece about Lazar on my website, www.stantonfriedman.com, which I need to update because of new claims that the production of four at- oms of Element 115 (half life less than a second) in a huge accelerator operat- ing for more than three weeks verifies his false claims. Some have even falsely claimed that recent publications about magnetic levi- tation of various items, such as frogs, established that Lazar's science fiction about gravity wave amplification provid- ing anti-gravity that propels saucers have been verified. Unfortunately the new interest area of Exopolitics seems to have grabbed on to all these phony whistleblowers. Dr. Michael Salla (I did verify his degrees from Australian universities) has claimed that because governments have lied and have covered up UFO infor- mation and have intimidated witnesses (such as the Roswell sheriff) that some- how we must believe all the whistleblower claims because one can't expect verification or validation of their claims. There is no logic here. Yes, there has been intimidation and cover-up. But what is the purpose of the government supposedly wiping out all the academic records of these whistleblowers? The legal counsel at MIT told me MUFON UFO JOURNAL there was no way it could be done. No way a PhD can be granted without an advisor's name being provided, without a copy being on file. Validation of being in the military, receiving college degrees, or earning PhDs should be easy, even if one isn't provided with classified documents to establish the truth of whistleblower tes- timony about UFOs. Philip J. Corse's book The Day After Rftra?//(with William Birnes) contained a great deal of unsubstantiated whistleblower testimony about an alien body seen at Ft. Riley, and about how Corso had single-handedly, as head of the Army Foreign Technology Division (there were only two people in it, and for only 90 days in 1962; was he the se- nior officer) introduced a host of new technology into industry. He had indeed been a Lt. Colonel, and had a long military career, but no background in science or engineering. Corso also stretched his background, claiming in a sworn statement for attor- ney Peter Gersten, who was filing a suit to get the government to reveal his to- tal file, that he had been a member of the National Security Council, a very prestigious body indeed. Dr. Salla insisted that Corso had only said on the book cover that he was as- sociated with the NSC. I have a copy of the statement and his membership claim, and a letter from the Eisenhower Library saying he was not an NSC mem- ber and had never attended an NSC meeting. The point of all this is to be very wary of all whistleblowers. Trust but verify; and if their background doesn't check out, abandon the claims. Dr. Salla, please take note.

Earth-like extra-solar planet discovered Astronomers have announced the discovery of the smallest planet so far found outside of our solar system. About seven-and-a-half times as massive as Earth, and about twice as wide, this new extrasolar planet may be the first rocky world ever found orbit- ing a star similar to our own. \"This is the smallest extrasolar planet yet detected, and the first of a new class of rocky terrestrial planets,\" said team member Paul Butler of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. \"It's like Earth's bigger cousin.\" Currently around 150 extrasolar plan- ets are known, and the number contin- ues to grow. But most of these far-off worlds are large gas giants like Jupiter. Only recently have astronomers started detecting smaller massed objects. \"We keep pushing the limits of what we can detect, and we're getting closer and closer to finding Earths,\" said team member Steven Vogt from the Univer- sity of California, Santa Cruz. The new planet orbits Gliese 876, an M dwarf star 15 light years away in the constellation Aquarius. The \"super- Earth\" is not alone: there are two other planets—both Jupiter-sized—in the same system. This third world was detected by a tiny extra wobble that it caused in the central star. From this wobble, the researchers measured a minimum mass for the new planet of 5.9 Earth masses. The planet makes a full orbit in a speedy 1.94 days. Orbiting close to its star, scientists speculate that the planet's temperature is a toasty 400 to 750 degrees Fahren- heit (200 to 400 degrees Celsius). 'The planet's mass could easily hold onto an atmosphere,\" said Gregory Laughlin from UC Santa Cruz. © 2005 Space.com.

McLeod August Sky Moon Phases New Moon: Aug. 5 First Quarter: Aug. 13 Full Moon: Aug. 19 Last Quarter: Aug. 26 Bright Planets (Evening Sky) Venus (magnitude -3.8): Moving from Leo into Virgo. For northern hemisphere observers, Venus will be- come more difficult to observe as it will set less than 1.5 hours after the Sun, and will be observable only very low in the west during evening twilight. For more favored southern hemi- sphere observers, Venus will set nearly 3 hours after the Sun and will stand nearly 20 degrees high in the west-north- west at the end of evening twilight. Jupiter (magnitude -1.8): In Virgo. For northern hemisphere observers, Ju- piter will be visible very low in the west- southwest during evening twilight, and will set about 2 hours after the Sun in the west. For more favored southern hemi- sphere observers, Jupiter will stand about 35 degrees high in the west-north- west at the end of evening twilight, and will set about 4 hours after the Sun in the west. Bright Planets (Morning Sky) Mercury (magnitude 4.0 to 0.4): Moving from Cancer into Leo. For northern and southern hemisphere ob- servers, Mercury will brighten as it slowly emerges in morning twilight in the east-northeast during the second half of the month. By month's end Mercury will become lost in the glare of die Sun for southern hemisphere observers. Mars (magnitude -0.5 to -0.8): Mov- ing from Pisces through Cetus into Ar- ies. For northern hemisphere observers, Mars will rise near 10 PM in the east- northeast, and will stand about 50 de- grees high in the southeast at the begin- ning of morning twilight. For southern hemisphere observers, Mars will rise before midnight in the east-northeast, and will stand about 50 degrees high at the beginning of morn- ing twilight. Saturn (magnitude 0.2 to 0.3): In Cancer. For nordiern hemisphere ob- servers, Saturn will stand about 10 de- grees high in the east-northeast as morn- ing twilight begins. For less favored southern hemisphere observers, Saturn will rise in die east- northeast as morning twilight begins. PerseidsMeteor Showers: Date: Aug 10-15 (peaking on Aug 13) Rate: 66/hour August is a great time of the year to look at the sky after midnight. It is usu- ally still warm after the heat of the day, and skies can be surprisingly clear. It's just as well then that the year's best meteor shower, called the Perseids, al- ways occurs during this month. The Perseid Meteor shower occurs when the Earth passes tiiough the orbit of comet Swift-Tutde, a comet discov- ered back in 1862 which returns to the inner solar system every 128 years-its last visit was in 1992. In recent years, however, their num- bers have begun to increase, leading to a spectacular shower in 1994. Rates might exceed 100/hour, but in 1994 some observers counted several hun- dred to a thousand or more during its one-hour peak. There is a wide variety of meteors, die fainter ones being white or yellow, and the brighter ones green, orange, or red. About 1 /3 leave trails. Occasional fireballs will be seen, often ending in bursts. This is a very good photographic shower. The best time to view is after midnight in the early hours of the morn- ing of the 12th. Look to the northeast about 66 degrees above die horizon. The moon will not be a factor between midnight and dawn. Conjunctions and Occultations Aug. 8: Venus 1.2 degrees south of the Moon.
