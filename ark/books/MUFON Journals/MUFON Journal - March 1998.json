Aston The promises and problems of nano-technology By Warren P. Aston (Copyright 1997) With the passing of more than half a century, I believe that ufology has the right to expect some an- swers from the accumulated data from hundreds of thousands of unexplained sightings that have been documented worldwide. An emerging revolution in our own science may now hold a major key to understanding the technol- ogy that makes a UFO tick. For several years now a revolution has been slowly but steadily developing in science that has the potential, in the next decade or so, to change our world completely. That in itself is sig- nificant, of course, but what will be exciting to every UFO re- searcher is that this coming change bears some remarkable similarities to the UFO technology that has been observed in our skies (and sometimes on the ground) for so long. Furthermore, there are increasingly strong in- dications that this advance in our technology may have actually originated in part, or at least been spurred along, by the crash of an alien craft at Roswell in 1947. This new development is called nano-technology. The control of atomic or molecular matter Simply expressed, nano-technology (nano re- fers to a billionth) is the expected ability to be able to manufacture anything through the control of matter at the molecular or atomic level. This will require mas- tery of the very nature of physical matter. However, it is important to realize that no new fundamental sci- ence is needed for nano-technology to become a prac- tical reality, only engineering advances.(1) Nano-technology already exists in nature. One example we all know of are molecular machines such as DNA, RNA and the enzymes that make possible the reproduction and repair of cells and that manufac- ture proteins in the body. Now science is moving to- ward also being able to control matter at the most ba- sic level, a process that is well under way. Chemists are making great progress in design- ing and synthesizing molecules that bind to other mol- ecules at specific sites, allowing the same self-assembly that occurs in nature. The 1987 Nobel Prize in Chem- istry was awarded for just such a breakthrough. In 1988 About the author Warren P. Aston owns and operates a travel agency in Brisbane, Australia. He is the author of a highly- regarded anthropological and historical book based on nine years of fieldwork in the Middle East. An inde- pendent UFO researcher for more than 20 years, he is the author of \"An Analysis of the 1940 Udo Wartena Case,\" published in the MUFON 1997 International UFO Symposium Proceedings. a group at DuPont designed and fabricated a new pro- tein that is more stable than natural proteins. We now have tools allowing us to see and move individual atoms, and physicists are now making elec- tronic devices such as transistors that work at the mo- lecular level. The UFO Link What do all these impressive facts have to do with UFOs in general? Simply this: I believe that what we term \"nano-technology\" is nothing less than a ma- jor aspect of the alien technology that is witnessed as UFOs. There are some striking parallels between what nano-technology predicts for the future-even at this early stage-and UFOs as physical craft representing advanced technologies. Lets look at some of the things that nano-technology foresees: New materials Scientists and engineers have already begun fabricating new materials, \"nano-composites\" which have electrical and mechanical properties unlike any others known. Nano-technology will also make pos- sible the production of not only perfectly pure materi- als, but also large single crystals of materials which would open up new uses and processes. In 1997, scientists announced the development of carbon nano-tubes, describing them as not only the world's strongest material, but as \"quite probably the strongest material that can be made,\" anything up to 100 times as strong as steel. Roswell buffs will be in- terested that one of the properties of this fiber is that \"it can crumple without breaking, then spring back to its original shape.\" This new material is so exceptional that the possibilities for it's use seem straight out of the realm of science fiction. One proposal from Nobel chemist Richard Smalley at Rice University is for a millimeter wide carbon nano-tube to act as a tether, relaying data or electricity from the earth up to a satellite in a sta- tionary orbit 22,000 miles high. The storage of information The storage of information at a molecular level implies that super-advanced technology can be ex-"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 March 1998 MUFON UFO Journal tremely compact and non-localized. In other words, information-storage technology may eventually be able to function much as quantum physics tells us that our brains and consciousness do, unlimited by time and distance. Powerful super-computers smaller than any- thing now known could be developed. One of these, containing all of humanity's knowledge, could be mounted within our head, interfacing directly with the brain and resulting in an almost omniscient being. Manufacturing Almost any material object could be manufac- tured without the limitations of conventional tools. In practical terms, this means that even very large ob- jects could be built as a single seamless piece, rather than being assembled as separate parts. It has become, of course, almost standard to describe a UFO or the interior of a UFO craft as being without seams, rivets or joints. Restoration of habitats Molecular machines could be designed to re- store habitats to their natural state, remove specific iso- topes from nuclear waste, and toxic chemicals from water, make deserts fertile, or even \"terraform\" whole planets to a habitable state. Repair of body cells Molecular machines could be programmed to destroy or repair diseased cells within the body, re- build damaged organs, restore missing limbs, and re- store defective organs to perfect functioning, thus greatly increasing our life span. We could give our- selves the ability to absorb almost 100% of what we eat, recycling what we normally excrete and generat- ing the nutrients we need. We (or an alien) could breathe under water or in different atmospheres. Increase in intelligence We could bring other organisms up to a level of intelligence similar to our own, or we could create new intelligent biological organisms to perform spe- cific tasks for us. Increasingly it seems that some of the beings piloting alien craft may be exactly this. Genetic manipulation Nano-machines could locate, read and then store the genetic information of every living species in a central repository which, among other things, could then be used to improve or recreate all species, per- haps to depopulate a damaged habitat that has been restored. Economic revolution The speed of self-replicating molecular ma- chines could allow us to accomplish tasks that now take days or months in a fraction of that time and with- out the dangerous processes, by-products, and pollu- tion we now have. The resulting economic revolution would mean the elimination of the economic, environ- mental, and social problems that plague our planet. It would ensure that much more of our energy, time and resources would be quickly freed up for more productive and creative uses-exploring and exploiting the cosmos for example. Can you see, as I can, how closely the promise of nano-technology relates to ufology? The amazing performance characteristics of UFOs look much more believable when we know that our own science is pre- dicting such advances in the near future. Some of the more puzzling aspects of the phenomenon, such as seamless craft, reported alien life spans many times ours, \"abductions,\" and the \"Big Foot\" and robotic type creatures so often reported, start to make some sense in view of these new developments. My personal feeling is that describing alien technologies as being ''millions\" of years in advance of us is probably way off the mark; many may be only a few hundred years ahead of our science, or thou- sands at most. The dark side of nano-technology As with most things, however, there is a dark side to all of this. The wonderful promise of nano-technology could also be abused by amassing massive arsenals of weapons with far greater potential for destruction than our current nuclear and biological weaponry. On a more mundane level, the economic ad- vantages alone would allow a nation, or even a small group, which develops the ability to apply nano-tech- nology to dominate all others. There is mounting evi- dence that this is, in fact, what has already happened, and that the military/intelligence/industrial cover-up of UFO activity and recovered off-world technology has been orchestrated in part using nano-engineered de- vices far in advance of anything known elsewhere. In recent years a number of claims have been made suggesting that one specific nanoproduct, bio- logical computers many years ahead of anything avail- able commercially, have already been covertly devel- oped and put to work in the intelligence community.(2) If there is any truth to these independently made claims, we see one of the mechanisms allowing the UFO cover-up, as well as another reason for it. The connection with MJ-12 and Roswell When we examine the origins of nano-technology, things get really interesting. The very concept of molecular machines was first discussed as recently as the late 1940's by physicist Richard Feynman. To my surprise, in 1996 I discovered that"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal March 1998 PageS the other man credited with advancing these concepts at about the same time was none other than Dr. Vannevar Bush (1890-1974), the same man that a num- ber of documents and sources name as the senior mem- ber of MJ-12.(3) Is it just coincidence that what appears to be the very basis for alien technology was a subject of great interest to Bush? If MJ-12 had access to at least one crashed alien craft by 1947, as the evidence so clearly indicates, our concepts of nano-technology to- day may owe much to recovered alien technology.(4) Was background a factor? It is also possible that Bush may have been chosen for his position in MJ-12 not only because of his broad background in various fields, including com- puters, but because he had already developed molecu- lar concepts that would prove useful for understanding a crashed flying saucer. Richard Feynman's role in all this remained unclear, however, until the June 1997 release of Col. Philip (Torso's book The Day After Roswell, which gave what many researchers feel is the first believable de- scription of the back-engineering of recovered devices by the U. S. military. According to Corso, Feynman reportedly knew about the Roswell crash and the \"compressed molecu- lar\" materials recovered, leading to his well-known 1959 Caltech lecture which first pointed out the possi- bilities of molecular manufacturing.(5) Whether the Roswell/Corona crash was accidental, as commonly assumed, or intentional, as some have suggested, a defi- nite link between alien technoloy, MJ-12, and recov- ered craft is indicated, and we can be certain that the military and intelligence communities would have the strongest interest in the applications of nano-technol- ogy, however derived.

Durant Editor's Note: This is the final segment of Mr. Durant's analysis of the testimony of Dr. Jesse Marcell, Jr., regarding the debris recovered by his father, Maj. Jesse Marcell, near Roswell, NM, in 1947. This series is, in part, a response to the lengthy article by Kent Jeffrey in the July, 1997, Journal entitled \"Roswell-Anatomy of a Myth.\" There are reasons to suppose that Dr. Marcel was unusually well equipped to judge the anomalous nature of the material he handled: for example, the \"rod\" that the skeptics insist was only a stick of balsa wood. Elsewhere Dr. Marcel has spoken of his childhood hobby of building model airplanes from balsa wood, and apparently he had built dozens. During the interrogation he speaks of a model airplane hanging from the ceiling of his bedroom. As a hobbyist accustomed to working on a regular basis with balsa wood in many forms, Marcel's opinion about whether a certain rod that he had studied with rapt at- tention was or was not balsa wood should be given great respect. For the same reason, when Dr. Marcel says that the rod was metal, we should listen with care. Major Marcel was a radio hobbyist, which in those days meant building from scratch short wave receivers and trans- mitters and all the associated appurtenances. Obtain- ing a license to operate this equipment was not an easy matter either, for it required passing a difficult written examination and proficiency in sending and receiving Morse Code. Several times during the interrogation he men- tions his father's ham radio call sign, W5CYI. The son soaked all this up. That's why, during the interroga- tion, he speaks in awe, as if it were yesterday, about the aluminum tube construction of his friend's bicycle, and about his father's egg-shell blue '42 Buick con- vertible, and about the smell produced by sawing bakelite. Both were technicians Both father and son were technicians, tinkers and hands-on practitioners to the core. Dr. Marcel has carried on this tradition. Thus he is a skier, bicyclist, helicopter pilot, Army Reserve officer, aircraft acci-"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Page 6 March 1998 MUFON UFO Journal dent investigator, and so on, in addition to his demand- ing professional work as a surgeon. Neither Jesse Marcel, Sr. nor Jesse Marcel, Jr. were even \"average\" witnesses or reporters. Instead, they were exception- ally well equipped to sort the anomalous from the mun- dane. The character and probity of the father have been attacked. Todd concludes that he was a chronic spinner of tall tales, and if one is to credit Newton's story, Maj. Marcel was delusional. For various reasons, the testimony of the son has never been given much attention. Now that it has been demonstrated that Dr. Marcel's testimony is cru- cial, it can be expected that he will be attacked, prob- ably as a person suffering from a cognitive disorder or serious neurological disease, and we will be told that it runs in the family. The Ramey Hoax Gen. Ramey's press conference was a deliber- ate deception. The material he presented to the press, and thus to the American public, was neither the mate- rial collected by Maj. Marcel at the Foster Ranch, nor was it representative of that material. Moreover, it is not the remains of a Mogul array. The debris in Ramey's office matches the testimony of no witness on record. While the General was lying to the public, he was also deceiving the intelligence branch of the Army. Writing about Newton's identification of the debris as that of a balloon and weather target, C. B. Moore says, \"In fact, it now appears that Gen. Ramey wanted a second opinion after Warrant Officer Newton's identi- fication of the radar target debris.\" Moore goes on to say that the material in the General's office was flown at once to Wright Field. It was not sent to the Foreign Technology Division or a similar office, but directly to Col. Marcellus Duffy, the highest ranking officer at Wright Field, who would have known at once that the balloon was a balloon, and that the reflector was an off-the-shelf reflector. These re- flectors were developed under Duffy's personal com- mand during the war. Quick and efficient deception In order to insure the quick and efficient de- ception of Army Intelligence, it was necessary that Duffy be the one to receive this \"debris.\" Here are Duffy's words as quoted by Moore: \"While stationed at Wright Air Force Base in 1947, 1 received a call at home one evening saying that what was currently be- ing described by the press as a 'flying saucer' was being flown to Wright Field and would be brought to my home that evening for identification.\" (Emphasis added). In other words, the General did indeed want a Brig. Gen. Roger Ramey, commanding general of the Eighth Army Air Force (kneeling) and his chief of staff, Col. Thomas DuBose, with what Gen. Ramey claimed was the debris recovered from the site. second opinion, but not in the usual sense. He knew beforehand exactly what Duffy's opinion would be, as he had known in advance what would be said by the hapless Newton. And now he wanted that opinion spread throughout the Wright Field intelligence net- work. The FBI made inquiries, and was similarly disinformed. An FBI teletype message sent on the evening of July 8,1947, stated: \"(deleted name) at head- quarters Eighth Air Force, telephonically advised this office that an object purporting to be a flying disc was recovered near Roswell, New Mexico, this date. The disc is hexagonal in shape and was suspended from a balloon by cable, which balloon was approximately twenty feet in diameter, (deleted name) further ad vised that the object found resembles a high altitude weather balloon with a radar reflector...\" Ambiguities Resolved Gen. DuBose is the man in the above photo- graph posing with Gen. Ramey. Both are holding the"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal March 1998 Page? deformed radar reflector. DuBose, then a colonel, was Ramey's chief of staff, and would have known if the reflector in the photograph was what Maj. Marcel had brought from the Foster Ranch. According to all but one of those who inter- viewed DuBose, he said that the material had been switched. Mr. Jeffrey has chosen the testimony of that single odd-man-out, Jaime Shandera. This ambiguity, if it ever really existed, is now resolved in favor of those who claim that DuBose said the material was switched. The \"McCoy letters\" are adequately described by Mr. Jeffrey. He correctly points out that these let- ters make no mention of the existence of crashed \"discs\" or debris. Nor do they deny the existence of such material, but the strong implication is that McCoy believed there was no such material. This ambiguity is at least partially resolved, in that the hoax perpetrated on Col. Duffy would have been the basis for what McCoy and the rest of his colleagues at the Foreign Technology Division knew, or thought they knew, about the existence of physical materials connected with the \"flying discs.\" When the General Accounting Office discov- ered that the outgoing message traffic and the records of the military police unit at Roswell were missing and apparently destroyed, contrary to regulations, some thought this was a cover-up, and others thought it was merely an administrative error. A cover-up is likely This ambiguity is resolved in favor of \"cover- up,\" for reasons of consistency with the basic Ramey hoax. The removal of these records must have been done well after 1947, but recall that it was several years after 1947 that Army officers visited Bill Brazel, Mac's son, and confiscated the cigar box he had filled with tiny pieces of the \"radar target\" that still littered the Foster Ranch. Where did Ramey get the debris shown to the reporters and then sent to Wright Field? Almost cer- tainly from White Sands, where Capt. John R. Smith had routinely been using single balloons with single radar reflectors in connection with the V-2 rocket tests. Smith's recollection is that his targets were reinforced by \"plain\" instead of \"flowered\" tape. Ambiguities Unresolved What was the origin and nature of the material Maj. Marcel showed his son? It is important to note that Dr. Marcel's testimony elicited under hypnosis is not unique. A number of others who handled the mate- rial have left their recollections of this strange debris for posterity. The following fragments of testimony are transcriptions of tape recorded interviews with four such witnesses. Bill Brazel, the son of rancher Mac Brazel, who apparently was the first to find the debris, speaking of his father and of his own experience with some of the material: \"The next day he was up on the ranch, and he found this debris. He picked it all up, in his pickup, and was talking to people, and of course there was some talk about UFOs. Sheriff calls Air Force He was going to Roswell, and as far as I know, he got in touch with the Sheriffs department. They in turn called the Air Force. Then the Air Force got with dad and swore him to secrecy and they came out to the ranch and picked up this debris. Wood, I call it wood, I don't know what it was; it was something like balsa wood, but it wouldn't burn, and'I couldn't cut it with my knife.\" Maj. Jesse Marcel, Sr., who was sent to the site by Col. Blanchard, describing the material and what was reported to him about it by one of his subordi- nates: \".. one piece of metal, it looked like metal, any- way. It was not flexible, and it was as thin as the foil on a pack of cigarettes. It was that thin. One of my boys told me, There's something unusual here,' he said, 'I tried to make a dent in this metal, 'but,' he says, 'you can't bend it, you can't make a mark on it.' He says, 'I took a sledgehammer, and whammed it, I put it on the ground and whammed it. And the sledge- hammer bounced off of it!'\" Dr. John Kromschroeder, a dentist and intimate friend of Capt. Oliver \"Pappy\" Henderson, recounting an instance when Henderson showed him a strange piece of \"metal\": \"He said, what do I think of that? I said, well, it's different. And I felt it, and it did feel different. And I studied it some. And I was able to determine that its metal structure was different than alloys like we have in our aircraft, for instance. And of course he did preface this question by stating this was from this craft. Apparently, I think it was a case of 'appropriation,' that he acquired this, you know, for future study, perhaps.\" A member of CIC MSgt. Lewis Rickett was stationed at Roswell as a member of the Counter Intelligence Corps under Capt. Sheridan Cavitt. He accompanied Cavitt to the debris field after Cavitt and Marcel had made at least one previous visit. Approximately 30 armed military policemen were stationed in a ring several hundred yards in diameter to protect the debris field from in- truders. Picking up a piece of the debris, Rickett asked if he could try to break it. Cavitt told him to try: \"He"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PageS March 1998 MUFON UFO Journal says, do what we couldn't do. Go ahead, touch it! I said, for God's sake! ... what in the hell is that stuff made out of; it can't be plastic. I said, it don't feel like plastic. It just flat feels like metal, but I never saw a piece of metal that thin, that you can't bend... the more I looked at it, I couldn't imagine what it was.\" An expert Prior to his recruitment into the CIC, Rickett was attached to the Army Air Inspector's Office. His military occupational specialty was Line Chief and Air Inspection. This meant that he was an expert in the repair of aircraft systems and components. Immediately after the end of the war, Rickett was assigned to an air disarmament team inspecting German aircraft in Europe in order to gather data re- quested by the foreign technology specialists at Wright Field. These are the professional qualifications of the man who said of the debris, \"...the more I looked at it, I couldn't imagine what it was.\" Sheridan Cavitt retired as a lieutenant colonel after a career in counterintelligence. When research- ers attempted to question him about the events that took place in the summer of 1947, Cavitt insisted thai he did not know what they were talking about, and vigorously denied that he had ever been stationed at Roswell. Secrecy restrictions lifted? In 1994, pursuant to the Air Force investiga- tion of the Roswell Incident, Col. Weaver visited Cavitt, armed with a letter from the Secretary of the Air Force relieving Cavitt of any secrecy restrictions in order that he could speak freely. Cavitt told Weaver that he and Marcel had found a single rubber weather balloon and a radar reflector, and that these were in an area no more than 25 feet in diameter. Then he signed an affidavit to that effect, formally swearing that it was the truth. None of this answers the question about the nature and origin of the debris handled by Dr. Marcel. All that can be said with confidence is that the material and the circumstances of its appearance were such that it triggered a massive deception, and that neither the passage of five decades nor the intervention of of- ficials of such exalted rank as the Secretary of the Air Force have proven sufficient to unmask the deception. End Note: Dr. Marcel was furnished with a pre-publication copy of this article. In a letter to the author, he stated: \"I read your essay with utmost inter- est and I heartily endorse what you have to say about the interview conducted in Washington by Dr. Neil Hibler.\" Part Three American documents tell a convincing story By Gildas Bourdais Editor's Note: This paper was presented at the Primero Forum Mundiai de Ufologia in Brazil last December. Mr. Bourdais is from France. This is Part Three. It is a well-established fact that a policy of pub- lic debunking of UFOs was established in 1953 in the United States, but, as I have realized many times in France, the media keep ignoring it, so that it is neces- sary to repeat that again, even briefly, for the media. One of the biggest UFO flaps occurred during the spring and summer of 1952. The major event was, in July, the so-called \"Merry-go-round,\" during two Saturday nights of multiple sightings, confirmed by ra- dars, over the Washington, DC, area. This provoked a lot of turmoil in the press and in the Pentagon, and it attracted the attention of the CIA. Among all the official documents available to- day, we have a lot CIA papers of that period, which have been at the center of a violent controversy. When they were released in 1979, ufologists who had ob- tained them claimed that they proved a policy of se- crecy, and this claim was widely echoed in the press. However, the skeptic Philip Klass denied that in his book, UFOs: The Public Deceived, published in 1983 (9). What can we make of that today? In his book, Klass details a series of CIA documents which prove, according to him, that the CIA was very dubitative about the reality and the nature of UFOs. Clearly, a number of documents reflect such doubts, especially during the fall semester of 1952, but then there is a memorandum to the Director, dated 2 December 1952, which reveals a complete change of tone. It is regretable that Klass does not mention this memo, although it was declassified in 1975, eight years before the publica- tion of his book! The CIA Memorandum This memorandum of Marshall Chadwell, as- sistant director of Scientific Intelligence (OSI), to the director of Central Intelligence (at the time, Walter Bedell Smith) was on the subject of \"Unidentified Fly- ing Objects\" (10) (Doc 7). Here are key sentences from the very revealing paragraph 4: \"A. Recent reports reaching CIA indicated that further action was desirable and another briefing by the cognizant A-2 and ATIC personnel was held on 25 November. At this time, the reports of incidents con-"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal March 1998 Page 9 vince us that there is something going on that must have immediate attention....Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in the vicinity of major U.S. defense installations are of such nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or known types of aerial vehicles.\" What appears here is that, toward the end of 1952, there was no doubt left in the mind of the direc- tors of the CIA about the reality of UFOs, or about their somewhat menacing behavior. What did they do about it? Soon after this memorandum, the CIA pro- posed to the highest Defense authority under the Presi- dent, the National Security Council, to give UFOs the status of \"priority project.\" Then the CIA gathered with the US Air Force a scientific panel of top-level scien- tists, now known as the \"Robertson panel,\" from the name of its chairman, the physicist H. P. Robertson. This panel was gathered as soon as January, 1953, during three days in Washington, and was shown a careful selection of not too convincing cases, accord- ing to witnesses Allen Hynek and Edward Ruppelt. Scientists easily convinced Thus these scientist were easily convinced to sign a report (later published in the Annex of the Condon report) (11) (Doc. 8) recommending: \"That the national security agencies take immediate steps to strip the Unidentified Flying Objects of the special sta- tus they have been given and the aura of mystery they have unfortunately acquired\" (paragraph 4. a.). Needless to say, this recommendation was duly adopted, and it inspired the attitude of the US Air Force and its Blue Book commission during the following years. Clearly, this policy of public debunking is still applied today. In short, the American documents avail- able today demonstrate that the people in charge of security knew the reality of UFOs, but they decided to hide it from the public. This policy was decided, according to the con- clusions of the Robertson panel, to avoid false alarms and hysterical behavior, and to \"reassure the public of the total lack of evidence of inimical forces behind the phenomena.\" But, as we have just seen, the memoran- dum of December 2 revealed quite another situation. Was there only the presence of enigmatic UFOs to hide to the public, or was there more to it? Let's turn now our attention to the second question I raised,aUthe beginning; what can we draw from the official docu- ments regarding possible deeper secrets, such as the retrieval of a crashed UFO? The deeper secrets As soon as 1947, and during the following years, many documents now available established clearly the reality of UFOs, but they left open the ques- tion of their nature. This is the case of the two major documents previously mentioned: the Twining letter of September, 1947, and the Air Intelligence Report of December, 1948. Both documents ponder over the pos- sibility that flying saucers might be highly secret crafts of domestic origin, or \"foreign,\" which meant Russian, of course. In addition to that, they insist that they don't have any debris of a crashed saucer, and that they are very eager to find some. No deeper secret? This is a major argument put forward today by several American ufologists against the the idea of very deep secrets: the military were not sure of the true na- ture of UFOs, they did not have any debris, so they did not have any deep secrets! This argument has been used recently by Kent Jeffrey, for instance, against the Roswell crash, in his article published by the MUFON Journal (June 1997), called \"Roswell-Anatomy of a Myth\" (12) (Doc. 9): \"The 1947 and 1948 military documents are definitive. They cannot be simply and smugly charac- terized as 'absence of evidence.' They are evidence. They state definitely that there was no crashed sau- cer.\" How good is that argument ? I think for my part that it is a rather weak one, for at least two rea- sons. First, if there were deep secrets, such as the Roswell crash retrieval, about which very tight secrecy would have been imposed, then, of course, they would not be mentioned in such documents, even those stamped top secret. If President Truman did create a very small group of men, top scientists and military leaders (what- ever the name of that group), these men would not have communicated through the channel of an Air Intelli- gence Report, circulating in the Pentagon, and now declassified! On the contrary, it is logical to assume that such documents would have been designed care- fully to quell any possible rumors and suspicions in- side the military establishment about such highly se- cret operations. Documents were deceitful Second, it can be said that these documents were deceitful. Contrary to the opinion of some re- searchers, I can hardly believe that so highly placed people, particularly well informed, could be left in the dark about the existence of such a fantastic project that would have involved building a domestic saucer. They might have wondered about a Soviet project (although this is already doubtful), but certainly not about a do- mestic one! This can be said already of the Twining letter of 1947, but it becomes a glaring fact for the Air Intel- ligence report of December, 1948, more than one year"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Page 10 March 1998 MUFON UFO Journal later. The letter of Gen. Twining, after having clearly described UFOs in the first part, becomes very bizarre in its second part. Gen. Twining first explains, in para- graphs f and g, that it might be possible to build in the United States a craft comparable to the observed discs, but that it would be very costly: \"g. Any developments in this country along the lines indicated would be extremely expensive, time con- suming and at the considerable expense of current projects...\" Then comes the very strange paragraph h, which is perfectly incompatible with paragraph g: \"h. Due consideration must be given the fol- lowing: (1) The possibility that these objects are of domestic origin—the product of some high security project not known to AC/AS-2 or this Command.\" Interesting supposition Let's make things completely clear. Gen. Twin- ing is supposing here that both the director of Air In- telligence in the Pentagon, and his own Air Materiel Command (AMC), responsible for all technical stud- ies for the Air Force, in its divisions T-2 and T-3 at the Wright-Patterson base near Dayton, might have been left in the dark concerning a huge domestic project which would have severely affected financially all other projects, as he has just explained in the previous para- graph. I don't believe that, but I have found an Ameri- can researcher, Jan Aldrich, who finds such a conclu- sion conceivable on the part of Gen. Twining. To him, as he wrote to me (letter of Aug. 26,1997), \"it is pos- sible to consider that T-2, T-3, and Twining would think they might not know of some type of breakthrough U.S. development like the atomic bomb or the Proximity Fuse, as recent history had amply demonstrated.\" I don't find this argument very convincing. In fact, it is contradicted by other documents of the same period. In two declassified documents. Gen. Schulgen himself, who was deputy chief of Air Intelligence in the Pentagon, informed the FBI that the flying discs were not a domestic project. In a short letter to the director of the FBI, dated 5 September 1947 (two weeks before the Twining let- ter), he says (13) (Doc. 10): \"In answer to a verbal request of your Mr. S. W. Reynolds, a complete survey of research activities discloses that the Army Air Forces has no project with the characteristics similar to those which have been associated with the Flying Discs.\" Signed : George F. Schulgen Brigadier General, USA Deputy Assistant Chief of Air Staff-2 This information was already stated in an FBI memorandum dated 10 July 1947 (14) (Doc. 11): \"General Schulgen assured Mr. — that there are no War Department or Navy Department research projects presently being conducted which could in any way be tied up with the flying disks.\" What do we need to add to that ? As soon as July 10, the Pentagon was informing the FBI that the flying disks observed in great numbers across the coun- try were definitely not a domestic project. Why is the Pentagon still wondering, a year and a half later, about the existence of such a project, in the top secret Air Intelligence report of 10 December 1948? Let's quote the unbelievable \"conclusions\" of this report: \"11. Since the Air Force is responsible for con- trol of the air in the defense of the U.S., it is imperative that all other agencies cooperate in confirming or de- nying the possibility that these objects have a domes- tic origin.\" Of foreign origin? Of course, these \"conclusions\" also mention \"the possibility that some of these objects may be of foreign origin.\" Such a conclusion is not as unbeliev- able as the first one, but it can be argued that it is also rather peculiar. At that time, the Russians were work- ing hard copying the B-29 bomber. This is what the book Encyclopedia of'WarId Air Power (15) says about it: \"Faced in 1945 with a series of failures in the Soviet industry's attempts to build a modern heavy bomber, the Soviet leadership decided to produce a carbon copy of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, several of which had force-landed in Siberia during 1945 after raids on Ja- pan.\" The first Soviet bomber, named Tupolev Tu-4, flew in the spring of 1948, and production of 1,200 Tu-4's started in 1949. Of course, the US Air Force Intelligence and the Air Materiel Command were aware, first of the missing B-29's, and second of the Soviet production. Not very serious Therefore, we may honestly hint here that the document of December, 1948, was not very serious about the idea that, as soon as 1947, revolutionary Soviet planes were crossing the skies of the United States at supersonic speeds, and performing fantastic aerial shows, even over air bases. Some parts of these military writings are very revealing as to the reality of UFOs, but some other parts are just not credible. The only possible meaning of these strange statements is that they were hiding some aspects of the problem, even at a top secret level. It just might have been the recovery of a crashed disk. For the record, I want to mention here a differ- ent point of view, the one of French sociologist Pierre Lagrange. As he explains in his book La rumeur de"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal March 1998 Page 11 Roswell, and in several articles, these documents just demonstrate that the military were as baffled by UFOs as the general public. Hypothesis discarded Some of them \"believed\" in extraterrestrial crafts, and some others did not. But they soon discarded this hypothesis. In an article entitled \"When the U.S. Air Force believed in Flying Saucers\" (Review Anoma- lies, October 1996) (16) (Doc 12), Lagrange concludes: \"In August (1949), Project Grudge, successor of Project Sign, produces a thick report with clearly negative conclusions....The extraterrestrial hypothesis has not excited during a long time the military minds.\" A special position Please note the very special position adopted in France by Lagrange. He never discusses the ques- tion of the reality of UFOs. To him, the only question worth discussing here is sociological: the curious be- lief of a part of the military at that time in the extrater- restrial nature of UFOs. How curious! From such a point of view, the \"rumors\" of crashed UFOs deserve the same \"sociological\" treatment. Recently, another argument has been put for- ward against the idea of a very secret crash retrieval, based on documents from the Air Materiel Command stating that they did not have any debris from a crashed saucer. The first one is a letter signed by Col. Howard McCoy, dated 8 November, 1948. Col. McCoy's letter In November, 1948, Col. McCoy was chief of the Intelligence Division \"T-2\" of the Air Materiel Command at Wright Field. The now famous \"Project Sign,\" created at the end of 1947 to study flying sau- cer reports, was housed in its Intelligence Analysis Division (MCIA), headed by Col. Clingerman. As we know, the Project Sign team, headed by Capt. Robert Sneider, had written at the end of the summer of 1948 a thick report, classified top-secret, called \"Es- timate of the Situation,\" stating that flying disks were of extraterrestrial origin. This report had reached the highest levels in the Pentagon, where it had been rejected by the chief of staff. Gen. Hoyt Vandenberg, who judged that it lacked solid proof. Shortly after, in a letter dated 3 November, the Air Materiel Command was requested by Gen. Cabell, new director of Air Force Intelligence in the Pentagon, to send a new report, discarding of course the rejected conclusion of the Estimate of the Situation. This was done promptly with a three-page letter, dated 8 November, written again by the Sign team, classified secret, and signed by Col. McCoy. With due military discipline, it concluded now: \"8. The possibility that the reported objects are vehicles from another planet has not been ignored. However, tangible evidence to support conclusions about such a possibility are completely lacking.\" Another significant paragraph said : \"lO.c. Although it is obvious that some types of flying objects have been sighted, the exact nature of those objects cannot be established until physical evi- dence, such as that which would result from a crash, has been obtained.\" Definitive proof? Is that document definitive proof that there was no crash? This is the opinion, among others, of ufologist James Moseley, who sent it to me with this commen- tary: \"If this does not convince you that, as of late 1948, there had been NO crashes or other physical evidence, then nothing will.\" This argument has found a convincing contra- dictor with Dr. Michael Swords in his article \"The McCoy letter,\" published in the International UFO Re- porter of Spring 1997 (17). Swords has very clearly described the chain of events, starting with the deci- sion to write the Estimate of the Situation after the very spectacular sighting of Chiles and Whitted, going on with the McCoy letter, and followed by the Air Intelli- gence report of December 1948. A decision is made It is clear that a decision was made at that time to bury the mere idea of extraterrestrial craft. The op- eration was pursued at the beginning of 1949 with the disbanding of the original Sign team, replaced by \"Project Grudge,\" and a final report of the defunct Project Sign, stating that the extraterrestrial hypoth- esis would not be explored any more. This process was visibly forced upon the Sign team, so that all the documents involved have a low credibility, including the repeated statement that they had no UFO debris. If the policy was then to hide such a fantastic discovery, then the few people in charge of the operation, such as Gen. Twining, would not have acted differently. One objection expressed by the skeptics is that, if a crashed disk had been retrieved and studied se- cretly, this study would have taken place precisely in AMC and its technical divisions T-2 and T-3. The let- ter of Col. McCoy, they argue, proves that there was no such study. Again, we have a weak argument here, because if a very secret study had been decided, of course it would have been severely protected, and lim- ited to a small, compartmented staff. The technical staff of T-2 and T-3 would not have been associated with it as a whole. Besides, if the Sign team had been in the know, it would not have written the Estimate of the Situation. As for Col. McCoy himself, if he was in the inner circle, which is"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Page 12 March 1998 MUFON UFO Journal not certain, his letter was a purely deceitful document. Another document Recently, Kent Jeffrey has mentioned another document from the Air Materiel Command, in his ar- ticle, \"Roswell—Anatomy of a Myth.\" A 289-page document, released under FOIA in March, 1996, con- tains the minutes of the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board Conference at the Pentagon on March 17 and 18, 1948. Says Jeffrey: \"Buried in the document was a very interest- ing statement by a Col. Howard McCoy which referred to a number of unpublished UFO reports. The last sen- tence of McCoy's statement, however, is devastating to the Roswell case.\" Let me just quote the beginning and the end of it: \"We have a new project - Project SIGN - which may surprise you as a development of the so-called mass hysteria of the past summer when we had all the unidentified flying objects or disks .... We are running down every report. I can't even tell you how much we would give to have one of those crash in an area so that we could recover whatever they are.\" The same objections can be applied to this document. Again, if a highly secret crash retrieval had taken place, it could not have been revealed at such a conference. Information had to be restricted to a very small number of people.

Dan Wright Minnesota video Anatomy of a network hoax By Dan Wright, Director MUFON Abduction Transcription Project Having analyzed well over 900 audio tapes of claimed abduction accounts since 1992 involving 265 separate cases, I plainly wanted the UPN production, \"Alien Abduction-Incident in Lake County,\" aired Jan. 20, 1998, to be the genuine article. Finally, I thought, the proliferation of camcorders might have caught an actual abduction in progress. The thousands of hours spent by abduction re- searchers and myself deciphering often ambiguous rec- ollections of night visitors would thereby get a great boost at the hands of an alert 16-year-old who kept his machine running on Thanksgiving evening of 1997. This might have one day been heralded by all who pay at- tention to UFO events as a wa- tershed, the moment in time when alien intruders made their presence undeniably known. That was not to be, how- ever. Numerous major flaws stand unalterably in the way of acceptance that this was a genuine UFO en- counter, even as portrayed by actors. For those unfamiliar, the program depicts the McPherson family and guests, a group of nine people, about to sit down to a Thanksgiving dinner at 6:20 p.m. when the lights go out. Over the next five hours, virtu- ally every major facet of UFO abductions in America over the past 50 years occurs on this property. The videotape ends at 11:29 p.m., the producers stating that all nine people were taken and, as of the airing, not returned. Assumptions disproved First, we are to assume that the event occurred in Lake County, MN, as stated in the show's title and repeatedly by the voice-over commentator, though a more precise locale is not mentioned. Second, at the outset \"Sheriff Kent Tilson\" (in proper uniform) says without qualification that he dis- patched a deputy who found \"the videotape recovered from the family's abandoned home.\" Third, at multiple junctures a printed message and voice-over state: \"This program contains shock- ing and often disturbing images. Viewer discretion ad- vised.\" That language has always been reserved for real circumstances, and the viewing audience is thus led to believe that this program is no different."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal March 1998 Page 13 Wrong sheriff My call on Jan. 22 to the dispatcher at the Lake County Sheriff Department (located in Two Harbors, northeast of Duluth along Lake Superior's northern shoreline) elicited two basic discoveries: First, for the past three years Andy Haugan has been the sheriff; the dispatcher was unfamiliar with the narrie Kent Tilson. Second, Lake County had no such report of a disappearance, or any UFO report, for that matter, dur- ing the period surrounding Thanksgiving 1997. Parenthetically, and without having checked weather records, one can surmise that it's awfully cold there in the final week of November. Yet the videotape in question never showed anyone's breath while out- side, let alone snow on the ground. Two persons well known to ufology and with prominent MUFON connections made several appear- ances on the tape. Yvonne Smith is a highly respected, certified hypnotherapist and longtime contributor of tapes to the Abduction Transcription Project. Stanton Friedman, nuclear physicist and UFO lecturer, likewise is a person beyond repute for his dedication to finding the truth. Lending credence Their appearances as part of the program were certainly intended by the producers to lend credence to the McPherson account. In their numerous remarks, neither cited any specific aspect of the events on the videotape. Obviously, then, they were simply asked questions by the production crew rather than being af- forded an opportunity to screen the tape. Walt Andrus, MUFON's international direc- tor, has often said the MUFON UFO Journal exists to portray genuine UFO events, not hoaxes or mistakes. In this instance, however, we are beset with a major player, Dick Clark Productions (yes, that Dick Clark), first soliciting commentary from well established in- dividuals in the field of UFO research, then selling the program to Paramount Studios and its network of af- filiated television stations, UPN, as portraying a real event. That is not only highly unethical, it's scary. For purposes of possible repetition in the future, we need to consider how and why it was done. UPN and Paramount may have protected them- selves against legal action by citing the program in the TV Guide for the week of Jan. 17-23 as a docu-drama and (well into the credits at the program's end) by show- ing the actors' names and stating that Friedman and Smith were interviewed without benefit of the tape. Still, even the term \"docu-drama\" implies that the core event is genuine, whereas there was absolutely no basis in truth underlying this travesty. Regardless of the overall purpose of Dick Clark Productions and Paramount/UPN, this constituted an intentional and egregious manipulation of Smith and Friedman in par- ticular. Their reputations should not be sullied for hav- ing been taken in. Further, the program was a gross misrepresen- tation to the general public: at no time prior to the credits was there any indication that the participants and events were other than as portrayed. The alleged abduction subjects were identified as: Tommy McPherson (the videographer), his mother Roslyn McPherson, Kurt McPherson, Linda McPherson, Mathew Wilson, Melanie McPherson, Brian McPherson, Renee Laurent, and five-year-old Rosie McPherson. Other commentators (with superimposed creden- tials) during the program were shown as: Forbes Riley, identified as a \"TV news re- porter\" (but without network or station identifier) \"Al James\" (pseudonym), a \"former govern- ment agent,\" whatever that means Dr. Michael Shermer, editor, \"Skeptic Maga- zine\" Frederick Pearl, \"video EFX editor\" Dr. Gary Arthur, \"child psychologist\" Janet and Dennis Logan, \"abductees\" Jeane Sutton, \"abductee\" One simple phone call to the Lake County, MN, Sheriff Department and a careful review of the credits produced sufficiently damning evidence that this en- tire production was a hoax. Given the likelihood, however, that we have not seen the last claim of an authentic abduction vid- eotape, the remainder of this report presents holes dis- covered in the taping itself. The Acting Having had two close encounters of my own, and having interviewed dozens of CE witnesses over the years, I realize that, under extreme circumstances, many people act in strange ways. So it was not sur- prising to see Roslyn McPherson, the family's matri- arch, carrying her glass of wine outside to find her missing sons, Kurt and Brian. Likewise, the fact that she and four others pro- ceeded to a pickup which had a dead (and partially melted) battery, as logically would have been related to them earlier by Kurt or Tommy, is also within the range of acceptable behavior under great stress. Relatedly, folks in many anxiety-induced situ- ations say lots of dumb things and wonder later why they would have made such dreadful or silly remarks. There is little to be gained, therefore, by bashing the participants for seemingly contrived words, intonations or body language. One person, though, did stand out in this re-"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Page 14 March 1998 MUFON UFO Journal gard. Five-year-old Rosie was unusually calm, at sev- eral points asserting what might be typified as parental advice, her statements often delivered in a flat tone. Moreover, it seemed that each time the camera focused on her, she had an immediate and telling remark: \"Don't shoot, you might hurt somebody.\" \"Let's all go downstairs now.\" \"It'll stop burning in a minute.\" \"It's okay, go back in the house and calm down.\" As conveyed later on the tape by \"Dr. Arthur,\" these lines were not only presented with little emotion, but also seemed too pat, as if the adage \"a child shall lead them\" was in effect. In reality, of course, this was just bad acting by an amateurish child actress. Kitchen Sink Syndrome Virtually every aspect of alien intrusions re- ported in the literature over the past five decades was portrayed in this one event, including power outage, mutilated cow, glowing wand, laser-like beam, sub- ject ears ringing, shattering objects, telephone ringing, dead auto battery, aliens on the roof, static on video- tape, missing time, nosebleeds, ball of light indoors, triangular body marks, appliances on and off, melted gun barrels, and subject paralysis. Were all of this genuinely to happen as part of a single event, that would make for a really bad day. Audio Supplements Accustomed-even inured-as we all are to stir- ring musical scores as part of adventure films, it was sometimes barely detectable that the producers of this program had inserted, at low decibels, frenetic music to accentuate certain high-intensity situations on the tape. More seriously, when the chief cow mutilator fires at the three young men with its rod/wand, two sounds are heard: (a) a low wavering hum, followed immediately by (b) crackling electricity. Coincidentally or otherwise, these are very remindful of the sounds emitted by light swords brandished in the \"Star Wars\" trilogy. Who Are These Guys? The beings on the tape are always shown in poor light, which is just as well, for many B-movies have dressed them better. Granted, grey-tone entities are sometimes 5 feet or taller, as these are, and may even have a rather robust physique, as these do. But the combination of a long, wide, prominent nose, full- lipped mouth and broad chin is virtually never reported. Not to mention very thick hands with three fat, stubby fingers in cloth gloves. Credit, though, should be given to the program's director for instructing the entity to tilt its head near the end to show curiosity about Tommy. Nice touch. T. David Spencer By T.

After having break- fast with friends, the wit- ness left a local restaurant and drove toward her home, starting northward along Dale Mabry highway. Al- most immediately, she saw red and white lights glitter- ing to her right and at a low elevation, which appeared to be from a blimp on a northward course. She made a right turn onto Hillsborough Av- enue, then crossed over to West Commanche, heading toward the object. When she stopped at the stop sign at Armenia Avenue, it was floating \"like paper\" over some trees behind a restaurant across the street. Shaped like an unfolded hand-fan with its apex at the top and rounded at the bottom, the windowless, greenish-brown object rocked and turned slowly. She saw three pulsating red-orange lights, one at each cor- ner, and a small, twinkling white light on each straight edge from the apex. As it turned, the object revealed itself to be \"flat, like a pancake or Frisbee. It had a scratch, or grain-like lines running left to right that re- flected a copper-gold-like color on its surface.\" Deciding to call a television station, hoping they would film the craft, she headed toward a telephone booth. As she did, the floating object began to move away. She shouted to a man across the street. He looked at the oddity and exclaimed. \"What is it?\" Although uncertain previously, she was convinced it was not a blimp or hot air balloon. Both watched as the object departed, first slowly, then very fast, until it was no more than a dot in the sky. Another man left the restau- rant and saw the object before it was out of sight.

Lang MUFON became informed of this sighting through e-mail. Having a late lunch in the Highland Crossing Mall, the witness, who has experienced UFO sightings and is well read on the phenomena, casually looked through a window to the northeast sky. An odd-shaped object, not at all like an airplane, caught his attention. He studied the motionless oddity for a long time, noting it to be a \"ceramic-like\" white disc shape with an apparent division between its top and bottom. Then he watched it slowly descend diagonally to his right until it was a \"fist width\" (approximately ten de- grees) above the tops of the buildings. At this point, the object suddenly began to ascend almost vertically, at a much faster rate. In five seconds, it rose until it was behind a small cloud and out of sight. Estimates by the investigator, from consulting with the witness, suggest the object could have been 140 feet long and 28 feet from top to bottom. It was descending at about 135 miles per hour and climbing approximately 765 miles per hour.

Jones The witness is the same person as one of the investigators. While sitting on the deck of his second-story apartment, the witness noted a dark cloudlike, boo- merang shape at about a 75-degree elevation in the east, moving in the same direction as the easterly wind. Its apex trailed \"finger-like\" arms. \"The object did not look like a cloud or wispy.\" \"My first instinct was that this was some kind of debris loosely held together ... The mass [then] ap- peared to be dissipating at a rapid rate. . . It seemed like the two tips [were moving] inward.\" When it be- came about one-fifth its original size, looking more like a boulder than a boomerang, it stopped changing. The object continued its course until it was out of sight. (A similar object was seen in New York, and reported to the USAF on April 11, 1964. It developed from \"a very black spiral formation of what appeared to be smoke. \"Wisps of smoke were seen to be \"stream- ing out of the black cloud—almost boiling out. \"It as- sumed \"a shape not unlike a banana.\" The sketch indi- cated the arms of the banana shape led the center.

Driving to work, the witness saw a jet aircraft and another airplane, then a strange, hovering object at a distance in front of her. She pulled into a store's parking lot to get a better look and saw the object, shaped like a chevron (arrowhead), slowly approach- ing her with its tip (point) at the rear. The shape reminded the witness of the stealth bomber (B-2), but flying backwards. Its body was \"dark metallic\" and had \"very large red lights\" on its tips. Small blue-white lights were toward the center of the vehicle, just inside the red lights. One red light slowly blinked. A nearby, small airplane maneuvered as if its pilot, too, was trying to get a better view of the object. The craft turned counterclockwise and glided noise- lessly about five miles to the northeast. It hovered for between three and four minutes, then suddenly disap- peared. From information obtained, the investigator es- timated the craft's length to be about 40 feet. The local police and sheriff's departments had no reports from other witnesses, and the FAA had no radar traces of unusual objects that evening.

Sitting at their kitchen table and looking out the window, a man and woman talked as they watched aircraft over the Minneapolis skyline. From the right side of the window, a strange object was seen moving slightly slower than the aircraft, to their left along a tree line. The shape was that of three right-triangle fins 120 degrees apart, like feathers on an arrow, without an observable fuselage. The object went behind a tree, then emerged on the right side, apparently having turned 180 degrees while not visible to them. It continued toward the right until it had retraced half of its original path, then it again reversed its course and moved leftward until al-"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Page 16 March 1998 MUFON UFO Journal most out of view. It reversed again and moved to the right, finally disappearing behind a building. The witnesses claimed they felt something sin- ister from the craft. The FAA said there were no un- usual radar-detected events at the time. Minnesota right-triangle fins LOG # 971129fC, FB-1,10/30/96, Minneapo- lis, MN, at 21:15 hours CST, 03:15 GMT, for 30 sec- onds. Index = 17% Investigators: Craig R. Lang, Mar- garet DeHarpPorte. This sighting was brought to the investigator's attention while he was following up on another sight- ing by these witnesses (LOG # 971129bC, discussed later). After putting her daughter to bed, the woman witness had an impulse to look out the kitchen win- dow. The window gave her a view of the Minneapolis skyline and a line of trees to the side. At first, she did not see anything unusual. She and the second witness watched aircraft and stars in the sky for several min- utes. \"What's that coming over the trees?\" she asked as she noticed a strange craft. Both witnesses could see the object was very much like an airplane, but larger and at a much lower altitude, at or below the tree line. They thought it was between them and the city. The second witness grabbed his 7x25 hunting binoculars and studied the object, and he \"half expected to see passengers. . .\" He did not see personnel, but he could tell that the craft was a dark triangular form of three right-triangle fins fitting together along the longer side (not the hypotenuse). Large, intense (neon-like) red lights in the middle and other red lights at the base of each fin, where a fuselage should be, illuminated the surface. Looking from the back side, each fin was 120 degrees from the others. The finned object moved smoothly and level from their right, possibly turning several degrees away from them, giving a view of its rear. Estimates by the investigator, based on all information obtained, show the object was most likely between 60 and 375 feet in length and moving between 33 and 190 miles per hour. The FAA had no reports of unusual radar observances. Minnesota red and green beams LOG # 971129bC, CE-1, 10/18/96, Fergus Falls, MN, at 19:50 hours CST, 01:50 GMT, for 5 min- utes. Index = 25% Investigators: Craig P. Lang, Mar- garet DeHarpPorte This sighting was found by Minnesota MUFON in the \"UFO Roundup\" journal on Internet, and initial contact was made using e-mail. Driving with her two-year-old daughter to Fargo, ND, to visit her mother, the witness noticed an unusual star to her right. It being a crisp and clear evening, stars were easily viewable and twinkling, but this star was pulsating. As she continued her drive on an almost straight road between highway 59 and IH94, the star moved ahead of her. When she exited from the underpass to IH94, the star, now considered a nearby object, was \"right there,\" almost directly over her car. A circular soft-white light the size of her outstretched hand at arm's length passed over her car, then kept pace with her, in front and above her car, at the 10 o'clock posi- tion. She saw two narrow beams of light, one green and one red. They originated from different points at the top of the light and moved about irregularly. Excited, the witness rolled down the window, stuck her head out, and looked up at the object. Her speed dropped to about 50 miles per hour and she be- gan swerving on the road. The object continued keep- ing pace. Over a few seconds, the light apparently \"flipped upside-down.\" The red and green beams of light suddenly appeared from the bottom, rather than the top. The light then moved off to her left, almost casually gliding over the countryside, and slowly went out of sight in the distance. Cessna encounter in Florida LOG # 971205SE, FB-2, 01/27/95, Sarasota, FL at 00:45 hours EST, 05:45 GMT, for 5 seconds. Index = 27% Investigators: Don McLain, Jean Brown. The tower at the Tampa, FL, airport gave the witness the phone number for MUFON Florida and urged him to call, which he did. After picking up a business client in Orlando, the witness and his friend flew a Cessna 172 on a re- turn flight to Sarasota, FL. At 00:43 hours, when they were 30 nautical miles out of Sarasota, at an altitude of 3,000 feet, the squelch (noise level) of his ADF (au- tomatic direction finder) radio began to increase, then decrease, pulsating. A minute later, the plane began buffeting and pitching. Fearing malfunction, the witness (pilot) quickly studied the engine's gauges on the instrument panel. When he focused on the tachometer, \"the entire cockpit lit up with a brilliant light.\" In surprise, he muttered an expletive and looked upward, toward the light's source. At 11 o'clock, at about 5,000 feet, a semi-trailer sized, reddish orange and elliptical ball of light, looking much like red-hot metal, was streaming at lightning speed and at a steep angle of descent from East to West, toward Sarasota. The witness guessed it to be about 60 feet long and 20 feet wide. When it crossed his flight path in front of him, he could see two trails of greenish light emitting from the object, one on each side, which merged as a single contrail a half mile long. The pilot's friend, awakened by the flash of light"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal March 1998 Page 17 as the object flew by, watched in amazement. After another 2,000 feet of descent, the object quickly leveled off and went over the city, Sarasota Bay, Longboat Key, and on out over the Gulf of Mexico to disappear in the distance. The witness immediately called Tampa Approach to report what he had seen, but there had been nothing seen on radar. The Approach Controller called the only other plane in the vicinity, but it had been travelling in the wrong direction to have seen the object. A copy of the taped conversation between him and the FAA has been requested by the pilot, using the rights of the Freedom of Information Act. The esti- mated 21,600 mile-per-hour speed of the object puts it in a class along with meteors and re-entry of space debris, but the change in its course essentially elimi- nates this possibility. North Carolina object LOG#980101SE, CE-1, 11/25/97, Maiden, NC, at 22:10 hours EST, 3:10 GMT, for 2.8 minutes. Index = 19.1% Investigator: George Fawcett. The father of the witness knew of George Fawcett and advised him to report this sighting. Peacefully lying in bed late at night, the wit- ness noticed a bright light shining into his bedroom window that moved up and down twice. \"What the hell was that?\" he asked as he grabbed his .45 caliber pistol and opened his door to confront the intruder. What he saw was totally unexpected: a dark object rimmed with light that was moving (actually, bounc- ing) close to the ground no more than 300 feet away. Fear streaked up his spine and his heart raced as he thought: \"They're here to get me!\" The object went up and down \"really fast,\" although it was slower climbing than descending. While ascending, \"the bot- tom blinked a few times.\" About the size of a car, it was shaped like the crown of a baseball cap (without the bill), or an inverted, deep bowl. The rim was bril- liant white, and the bottom of the inside was dull yel- low. The remainder of the object was dark. After about six hops, the oddity went down behind the trees and beyond a nearby trailer. When it came back up, it went out of sight. Clad in only his underwear (shorts), the witness ran into his backyard and shouted to his neighbors, hoping someone else may have seen the sight, but there was no answer. Noticing the chill of the night, he went back in to put on a shirt, then returned to the yard and waited several more min- utes for the object to return. He was prepared to shoot it. When the cold became unbearable, he retired from his watch. George Fawcett contacted the chief of police, the county sheriff, the 911 Communications Center in Lincolnton, the director of a nearby planetarium, a re- porter of one radio station, and a staff member of an- other, but none had received a corroborating report. He would have called the airport, but he knew from prior experience that it did not have low-altitude radar sensing capability. Georgia girl followed LOG # 980105SE, MA-1,10/15/97, LaGrange, GA at 20:00 hours EST, 01:OO GMT, for 30 minutes. Index = 12.6% Investigators: Barbara Sheets, W. Tom Sheets. The MUFON State Director received word of this sighting and informed the investigators. Driving southward on Bartley Road, a teenage girl noticed a bright light that seemed to be following her to her farm residence, but it dropped back before she arrived. At home, she called to her older sister, who joined her to search for the object. When the two had driven a short distance northward on Bartley Road, they detected the light hovering just over some trees. As they watched, it moved back down the road from where they came. They followed and watched its side-to-side movements across the road at nearly two times treetop altitude as it continued its journey southward. It stopped and hovered over an area off New Hutcheson Mill Road and near Hogg Mountain Road. They observed that the shape of the car-sized craft was like a bell, or pos- sibly an upright triangle. At the top, or apex, was the bright white light, and near the bottom were two red lights. Suddenly, the object rushed soundlessly toward the witnesses at a high rate of speed, scaring the two and making them run homeward to avoid it. Before they arrived home, however, they saw the light again, now hovering below tree top level, near a tower used for cellular phone communications. The witnesses arrived home, gathered their courage, and left to locate the object once more. It was hovering over fields which were adjacent to their farm. When it moved closer to the ground, the girls again became frightened and returned home.

Durant's article, \"The Roswell De- bris Testimony of Dr. Jesse Marcel, Jr.\" (see the Janu- ary and February 1998 issues of the MUFON UFO Journal), presented a strong case against the skeptical community's claims that the debris recovered from the Foster ranch was merely the remains of downed Project Mogul Flight 4. Journal readers may want to review the re- sults of my own, independent research into the thin-strut (I-shaped and rectangular cross-section) debris frag- ment issue. It appeared in an article titled \"The Glue Explanation Just Won't Stick\" in the Winter 1997-98 issue of the International UFO Reporter, published by the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies. I evaluated the appearance, beam breaking strength, combustibility, and cut resistance of raw balsa wood and balsa wood coated with Elmer's Glue-All and an aircraft-quality casein-type glue. Simple and straightforward experiments provided unambiguous empirical data that indicate-conclusively-that the struts, which reportedly exhibited extraordinary physi- cal properties atypical of late 1940s technology, could not have been components from a Mogul balloon train. Robert A. Galganski West Seneca, NY Dear Mr. Connelly: First of all, thanks for publishing Malcolm Smith's review of The Oz Files in the December '97 issue. Granted, mistakes are bound to occur during an editorial switch, but the following is nevertheless amus- ing. \"There is a smattering of typographical errors,\" writes Smith, and in the next sentence: \"The index could have been expanded,.\" [sic] (Note the period next to the comma.). Now, whether the typo is Smith's or not doesn't matter; I appreciate the irony anyway. Thanks! (Editor's Note: The error was mine, not Mr. Smith's.) I should like to thank you also for publishing Joe Lewels' essay on The Holographic Universe. Michael Talbot's final book written before his untimely passing a few years ago (see Chapter 12 in Break- through by Whitley Strieber). The holographic idea is indeed a powerful one; partly because it explains everything science has ever unraveled regarding the structure of our universe, and partly because it appeals to the human spirit both intel- lectually and at a profounder level. The idea itself is an expression of the philosophy called monistic idealism (or transcendental monism), which posits that a unity of consciousness, not matter/energy, is the basis of ex- istence, the ground of all being. The universe is to the collective mind as a dream is to the individual mind (although, ultimately, individual minds do not exist). Monistic idealism will, in my opinion, soon replace the old materialistic thinking that has domi- nated our society since its inception. Rest assured, Mr. Connelly, that you will never encounter an article that will \"shoot all sorts of holes in the concept.\" The con- cept is, by definition, infallible: while it is possible to prove, it is completely impossible to disprove. It is the perfect philosophy. It explains every- thing-every paranormal UFO encounter, the high-strangeness of quantum physics, past- and future- life perception, NDEs, OBEs, the existence and pur- pose of life itself-every thing. Every human, whether a die-hard, nuts-and-bolts materialist or an idealistic New Ager, would do well to investigate this theory further. To my fellow MUFON members I recommend the following books (to name but a few), which are currently available at bookstores everywhere: The Self-Aware Universe: How Consciousness Creates the Material World by Amit Goswami, PhD; The Dream- ing Universe: A Mind-Expanding Journey into the Realm where Psyche and Physics Meet by Fred Alan Wolf, PhD; The Spiritual Universe: How Quantum Physics Proves the Existence of the Soul by Fred Alan Wolf, PhD; Who's Afraid of Schrodinger's Cat? All the New Science Ideas You Need to Keep Up with the New Thinking by Ian Marshall and Danah Zohar; The Matter Myth: Dramatic Discoveries That Challenge Our Understanding of Physical Reality by Paul Davies and John Gribbin; The Holographic Universe by Michael Talbot; The Conscious Universe: The Scien- tific Truth of Psychic Phenomena by Dean Radin, PhD, and The Holographic Mind: The Three Levels of Hu- man Consciousness and How They Shape Our Lives by Stanislav Grof, MD. A cogent perusal of each of these will result in a drastically altered perspective of human existence, a view that I feel is essential to possess before we can ever hope to fathom the magnificent profundity of the UFO phenomenon.

Puthoff, Ph.D. Institute for Advanced Studies at Austin, TX Editor's Note: The following material is an excerpt from a speech by Dr. Puthoff at the NASA Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Workshop, NASA Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, OH, in August of last year. Quantum theory predicts, and experiments verify, that empty space (the vacuum) contains an enor- mous residual background energy known as zero-point energy (ZPE). ZPE topics of interest for space flight applications range from fundamental issues (where does inertia come from?) to whether this vacuum can be en- gineered. The concept of''engineering the vacuum\" was first introduced by Nobel Laureate T.D. Lee in his book Particle Physics and Introduction to Field Theory. Quantum theory tells us that empty space is not truly empty, but rather is the seat of myriad energetic quan- tum processes that could have profound implications for future space travel. It was the advent of modern quantum theory that established the quantum vacuum, so-called empty space, as a very active place, with particles arising and disappearing, a virtual plasma, and fields continuously fluctuating about their zero baseline values. The en- ergy associated with such a process is called zero point energy (ZPE) because such activity remains even at absolute zero. If ZPE can be \"mined\" for practical use, it would constitute a virtually ubiquitous energy supply for space exploration. As Utopian as this may seem, physicist Robert Forward at Hughes Research Labo- ratories demonstrated proof-of-principle in a paper published in 1984. Proof that such a process violates neither energy nor thermodynamic constraints can be found in a paper by D. Cole and myself published in 1993 under the title \"Extracting Energy and Heat from the Vacuum.\" The fact that its potential application to space propulsion has not gone unnoticed by the Air Force can be seen in its request for proposals for the FY- 1986 Defense SBIR Program. Under entry AF86-77, Air Force Rocket Propulsion Laboratory (AFRPL) Topic: Non-Conventional Propulsion Concepts we find the statement: \"Bold, new non-conventional propul- sion concepts are solicited....The specific areas in which AFRPL is interested included....(6) Esoteric energy sources for propulsion including the zero point quan- tum dynamic energy of vacuum space.\" There is experimental evidence that vacuum fluctuations can be altered by technological means. This leads to the corollary that, in principle, gravita- tional and inertial masses can also be altered. The possibility of altering mass with a view to easing the energy burden of future spaceships has been seriously considered by the Advanced Concepts Of- fice of the Propulsion Directorate of the Phillips Labo- ratory at Edwards Air Force Base. Perhaps one of the most speculative, but none- theless scientifically-grounded, proposals is the so- called Alcubierre Warp Drive. Taking on the challenge of determining whether Warp Drive a la Star Trek was a scientific possibility, general relativity theorist Miguel Alcubierre of the University of Wales set himself the task of determining whether faster-than-light travel was possible within the constraints of standard theory. Alcubierre's further self-imposed constraints on an acceptable solution included the requirements that no net time distortion should occur (breakfast on Earth, lunch on Alpha Centauri, and home for dinner with your wife and children, not your great-great-great grandchildren), and that the occupants of the space- ship were not to be flattened against the bulkhead by accelerations. A solution meeting all of the above require- ments was found and published by Alcubierre in Clas- sical and Quantum Gravity in 1994. The solution in- volved the creation of a local distortion of spacetime so that spacetime is expanded behind the spaceship and contracted ahead of it, yielding a hypersurfer-like motion faster than the speed of light, as seen by ob- servers outside the disturbed region. The engineering requirements rely on the gen- eration of macroscopic, negative-energy-density, Casimir-like states in the quantum vacuum. Unfortu- nately, meeting such requirements is beyond current technological reach. Related, of course, is the knowledge that gen- eral relativity permits the possibility of wormholes, topological tunnels which in principle could connect distant parts of the universe-a cosmic subway so to speak. Publishing in the American Journal of Physics in 1988, theorists Morris and Thome initially outlined in some detail the requirements for traversible worm- holes, and have found that, in principle, the possibility exists, provided one has access to Casimir-like, nega- tive-energy-density quantum vacuum states. In principle, then, the vacuum can be engi- neered for space flight applications. However, engi- neering-wise it is clear that there is a long way to go. It is also clear that we are taking those first steps now in the laboratory. As we seek this \"magic\" solution, we are reminded of Arthur C. Clarke's phrase that highly-advanced technology is essentially indistinguish- able from magic."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal March 1998 Page 21 UFO MANIA The Lore and Legend of Ufology.

Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus (magnitude -4.2) and Jupiter (-2.1) pair up low in the ESE twilight sky. During the latter half of April, Venus closes with the giant planet. On the 23rd the crescent Moon joins the planet pair to form a truly spectacular and rare close encoun- ter. Except for certain Mars oppositions, these are the three brightest objects in the night sky, and they all appear close together that morning. For this dawn event, choose an unobstructed eastern horizon well in advance. Arrive early enough, if possible, to see the trio rise above the horizon as the Moon will be nearest the two planets at that time. Ve- nus and Jupiter will rise almost together between about 4 and 5 a.m. daylight time. (The interval between planet rise and sunrise will vary from 1 1/2 hours at 45 de- grees N to 2+ hours at 25 degrees N.) Seven times brighter than Jupiter, Venus will appear only 1/2 degree N of the former, while the lu- nar crescent (3 days before new) is about 1 1/2 de- grees below the pair. (The Moon gradually separates from the planets during twilight.) Observe the display with both the unaided eye and binoculars. If the fore- cast predicts severe clouds for that morning, try the previous day. On the 22nd the planets still are about as close together, with the Moon about 10 degrees away. This celestial gathering is well worth photo- graphing. Mount your camera on a sturdy tripod. Ex- posures will depend upon film speed, the lens-opening, and sky brightness. With ISO 64 speed color film and a standard 50mm lens, I've had good results shooting Moon crescents with nearby planets using exposures bracketed from 5 to 10 seconds at f/5.6 to f/11. Use a cable release to reduce shutter vibration. Meteor Shower: The Lyrids peak toward dawn on April 22 when their radiant point also is highest overhead. About 15 of the swift meteors dart out of Lyra the Harp (hourly rate). The meteor shower can be glimpsed all night, and from April 19 to 24, but in lesser numbers in both instances. Mars Rock Update: The November 1996 column announced the discovery of possible fossilized life forms in a Mars meteorite found in Antarctica. Since then, the research team's results have been heatedly debated as other sci- entists examine the rock. For instance, two independent groups say their findings indicate the microfossils may be earthly or- ganisms which infiltrated the meteorite after it arrived on our planet. These researchers performed detailed analyses of amino acids and carbon isotopes in the sample. The abundance of each matched those found in Earth's organic material. While the NASA discovery team agrees such studies weaken their hypothesis, its members believe other evidence in the sample remains uncontaminated and continues, to point to the possibility of Martian mi- crofossils. A resolution of the debate may have to await a NASA sample-return mission from Mars in 2008. Moon Phases: First quarter, April 3; Full moon, April 11; Last quarter, April 19; New moon, April 26.

The account will be limited to e-mail use only. Anyone interested must be a MUFON mem- ber in good standing, and must send a short paragraph about what they feel they will be doing, how they will handle difficult questions, and a short resume that should support a broad knowledge of the UFO phenomen and a broad knowledge of MUFON. This statement will be used to judge between the various volunteers, and for getting some idea of their writing style. Anyone interested in carrying out an important part of our daily function, for now and into the future, please submit your application to, or contact, MUFON headquarters for more information. SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS COVER DESIGN CONTEST The success of the 1996 and 1997 Symposium Proceedings cover design contests has prompted MUFON to make this an annual competition. Fran Geremia, wife of the New Hampshire State Director Peter Geremia, was the 1996 winner, and Anson Seale won the prizes for 1997 with his \"50th Anniversary of Ufology.\" The cover design should reflect the symposium theme, \"Closing the Great Divide Between Science and Ufology.\" It must also include, in addition to the theme, the wording \"MUFON 1998 International UFO Sym- posium Proceedings,\" the location \"Denver, Colorado\" and the symposium dates \"June 26-28.\" The contest submissions must be \"camera ready\" and not simply attractive designs, symbols, or artwork. The contest prize winner will receive $100 in cash plus $100 in MUFON publications or merchan- dise. Please submit entries to Walter Andrus, the sym- posium proceedings co-editor. The deadline for cover designs is April 1, 1998. MUFON LAPEL PINS Due to the popularity of the attractive lapel pins, we have received another order for distribution. The one-inch long oval-shaped pin has the MUFON logo in blue on a white background outlined in silver with a pin clasp on the back suitable for fastening to clothing. You may order yours from MUFON in Seguin, TX, for $5 plus $1 for P&H. This is an opportunity to let people know that you are a MUFON member by proudly wearing our new lapel pin. AWARD FOR SECURING NEW MEMBERS Numerous MUFON members shared their in- terest in the MUFON UFO JOURNAL by purchasing Christmas gift subscriptions for friends and relatives. We are extending this idea with a new concept to in- crease our overall membership. Any current MUFON member will be awarded a lapel pin if he/she solicits two new members by completing the enclosed form (page 22 or a copy thereof) and attaching a $30.00 check for each new member. A former member who has allowed his/her sub- scription to expire for over one year will qualify as a new member in this plan. Here is your opportunity to invite people who attend local meetings, your friends, and relatives to join MUFON, and you will benefit by receiving a free lapel pin.

VOLUNTEERS NEEDED FOR E-MAIL PROCESSING For more than two years we have had an e-mail address and have had some 2500 e-mail messages sent to us. When it was brand new, we found that we had to work with it for awhile to see what it was really all about. Now that we have an understanding of the e-mail system through the efforts of Tom Deuley, we are look- ing for volunteers to split up the 8 to 10 hours per week that it takes to receive, sort, and handle the mail. Volunteers will be asked to open the e-mail account one or two scheduled days per week to down- load all of the mail for that day, and then to go through it. answer what they can. set it aside if it has no mean- ing, or pass it on to the Director, the Journal editor, or whomever it may be addressed to in the MUFON or- ganization. Difficult mail will be forwarded for reso- lution to the Director. Most often preformatted responses can be used for people asking for information to join, or asking for information on what we do. (MUFON headquarters will provide standard information packets.) Volunteers need to be able to tactfully answer questions and make statements for MUFON; therefore they must have a full understanding of MUFON and its bylaws, poli- cies, goals, and mission.
