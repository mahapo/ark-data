Certainly not in numbers! By Joel Mesnard/Translated by Claudia Yapp \"y f* we take the word abduction in its strictest I T sense, we cannot cite 29 examples in France, JL J_ merely ten or so. We are using this word in a larger, more general sense here. In effect, there are numerous accounts that even if they don't strictly include a classical abduction, seem to be closely relat- ed, closely enough so that we can't actually classify them separately. This is true also for the element known as missing time, a memory-gap linked to a close encounter. When the witness cannot remember what happened during a particular phase of the encounter, whether or not they went on board, then he or she still lost control of their actions and became an object, not an actor. Likewise, some cases of \"paralysis\" or of \"tranquil- isation\" linked to the close observation of a UFO do not substantively differ from cases strictly defined as abductions. The Bouahmama case is a good example of this, and here is another which comes from an arti- cle by Pierre van Oudenhove in the Parisien Libere (Seine-et-Marne edition). (Pierre van Oudenhove has a great deal of experience with ufological investiga- tions and we doubt if anyone knows more about UFO sightings in the Seine-et-Marne region). The article, titled \"A Flying Saucer in Beauval?\", covers an event that occurred on August 28, 1977 near Meaux. \"When Mrs. Ghislaine Bonnefoy, a pediatric nurse for Dr. Tupin, started work at the hospital the other morning, she told her co-workers about a strange adventure she had had the night before at the window of her apartment in Beauval. It was 1:00 a.m. and her husband was asleep, but Mrs. Bonnefoy could not sleep. She heard a noise like a whistling or the faint noise of a turbine, coming from the side of the neighboring building. She went into the next room and opened the blinds, through whose gaps light was coming. She was amazed to see, directly opposite her, some 20 meters away, a dark, immobile mass. It was a metallic-look- ing saucer and appeared to be five or six meters in diameter. The device was about six meters off the ground, a bit above the tops of the trees in the yard. It was perhaps a meter [top to bottom] and was topped by a sort of cupola. The surface was smooth and ... had no portholes. The underneath part had twinkling red and yellow lights. Mrs. Bonnefoy found herself paralyzed, unable to move or to wake her husband. She stayed like that for an hour, across from this strange thing which contin- ued to make its turbine-like noise. Then suddenly, the device rose slowly and after a gentle stop, departed in the shape of a red disk with extreme speed to the southeast. Mrs. Bonnefoy was then able to leave the window and wake her husband. She was very upset and her husband had to comfort her. The next day, she noticed that the grass on the lawn over which the device had flown was slightly burned. She went to the police station to make a report. It seems that, at present, she is the only person to have seen this mysterious \"nocturnal ship.\" Although a park guard, Mr. Lucas, making the rounds with his dog that night, did see in the direction of Beauval a luminous phenomenon perhaps corresponding to this curious apparition seen by Mrs. Bonnefoy. Whatever it was, it is a complete mystery and the lack of witnesses does not help in solving it.\" see a striking similarity between the Beauval case and that of Bouahmama. When a wit- ness is so mesmerized for such a long time by what he or she sees that they cannot even think about calling out to someone, we can say that they have lost all con- trol of the situation. Whether the witness was actually \"taken\" without remembering anything, or whether they stayed put, we have here a type of experience that does not funda- mentally differ from an abduction in its broadest sense. All these experiences can thus be united, with- out a major disruption. So let us say that there is an abduction in this broad sense when the witness loses all control over events, to the point where he or she feels more or less removed from their familiar uni- verse. We will see in our 29 French cases, three examples that could be considered attempted abductions. We took them into account even though they were appar- ently not successful. On the other hand, there are cases that we could consider abductions which we have not included in the list. The Beauval case and that of Origny-en- Thierache on February 28, 1974 (LDLN #139) are very good examples. Our choice, perhaps arguable, is simply due to having to arbitrarily decide one way or the other. In fact, there is an obvious continuity between the most flagrant abduction cases and certain \"classic\" close encounters of the third kind. In other words, the boundary between abductions in the broad sense and \"simple\" close encounters is fairly fuzzy. We do not know which perfectly defined crite- JANUARY 1994 NUMBER 309 PAGE 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL ria enable us to say if a specific case is or is not an abduction. There are numerous close encounters where we can wonder if they were not in fact more complicated than the accounts would imply. Thus, Pierre Guerin, who is very interested and involved in the Valensole case (July 1, 1965), remarked that tak- ing into account the hour when the event occurred (5:45 a.m.), the hour when the Cafe des Sports opened, and its distance from the Olivol field, we can see that it took a very long time for Maurice Masse to come to his senses and go back to the village. Imagining that something may have happened that he did not remember is an obvious supposition, but one which cannot be verified. So for the time being, let's stick to facts, that is, to accounts where there is a reported loss of control which characterizes all abduc- tion cases. Precautions of Use Within this panorama of abductions in France, we find ourselves once again in an infinitely delicate domain. We are in the misty surroundings of Magonia, an incomprehensible country where the grandiose and the derisory blend together. The unwarned reader will probably be shocked by the unbelievable, absurd, and half-demented content of the majority of the accounts that follow. Certainly some resemble confabulations. But do not be mistak- en: in the ensemble there is something quite different. There is a category of experience the nature of which escapes us and which our culture insists on ignoring. Be careful: despite appearances to the contrary, it would not be sensible to dismiss them. But be careful, also, not to take these accounts completely at face value, considering them to be experiences of the same nature as ordinary experiences. It would be wise to consider these accounts as neither false nor true, at least initially. Moreover, the problem of their \"reality\" is very probably a false one, a sort of conceptual trap, inasmuch as it requires either a yes or no answer. These stories thrust us into the domain of the inbe- tween, the unproven, and the unprovable, into the country of paradoxes, strangely furnished with materi- al \"proofs,\" sometimes seemingly unimpeachable, but always ultimately insufficient. It is especially impor- tant not to conceal this absolutely confusing (and manifestly misleading) aspect of close encounters, since it may well be the phenomenon's most basic characteristic. The memories of abductees are probably not a faithful representation of what they actually experi- enced. We may even be dealing with false memories, artificially implanted, perhaps with the sole purpose of making such accounts unbelievable. In short, we would do well to suspect that the abductees' tales are there merely to mask the true nature of abductions! The memories of abductees may not be a faithful representation of what they actually experienced. We may even be dealing with false memories, artificially impanted. T he data that follows is very uneven in quality [from a variety of sources and spanning the years from 1921 to 1992]. Some cases can be checked at the source, while for others this is impossible. The quanti- ty of information is also very uneven from case to case. Some of these stories (nos. 1, 3, 9, 16, 18, 21, and 24) have been widely told but without the general public becoming aware of an abduction phenomenon. Ironically, the one French case (Nov. 1979 in Cergy- Pointoise) that got important media coverage turned out to be a joke and is not included in our list. Cases 10, 17, and 23 were covered in depth in issues 305, 302, and 299 of LDLN and are not covered in detail here. Case 1:1921 on the edges of the Canal du Nord As with stories of UFOs, stories of abductions don't begin yesterday, but contemporary cases have the dou- ble advantage of being much better documented and of allowing for a possibility of being studied in depth. Thus, we'll begin with the twentieth century. The first report, in chronological order, is 71 years old. It was told in the letters from the readers section of Paris Match, No. 291, October 23, 1954. About the witness we know only three things: his initials (G.B.), that in 1954 he lived in Marseille, and that he was eight years old at the time of his experience. Nevertheless, the story is interesting. Here is the let- ter: \"In 1921, a very hot year, I was playing one day along the banks of the Canal du Nord. I was 8 years old and I loved to play in the moonlike landscape created by both the construction and the war. Suddenly two beings dressed in a kind of flexible diving suit sprang from among the acacia trees. Without further ado, they dragged me toward what I thought was a strangely shaped tank. They raised me into the machine, without my being able to resist. I should say, 'without my being able to want to resist.' All of a sudden, I started to cry. and I don't know if they were moved, but after several minutes, an open- ing appeared in the ceiling of the room, and in several seconds I was back on the ground. However, I had to walk a large part of the afternoon before returning to the road I had left five minutes ear- lier. When I got home at night my parents accused me of lying, and no one ever wanted to believe my story.

See case 7. can hardly give details about the apparatus and its room. I was probably too upset. I remember only two details: There were square port holes, or at least rec- tangular. The room had a kind of flexible couch on which I sat. I think 1 remember that the diving suits looked metallic. I don't remember anything about the beings' anatomy, except that they were very tall and very slen- der.\" Case 2: May 20,1950, Cours-les-Barres (Cher) Any abduction is by necessity strange, but some are more so than others. This is one M. Veillith wrote about in LDLN 86. Since this issue dates from January 1967, it is no doubt useful to repeat here the major points of the adventure of Miss Micheline G., aged 32. Around 4 p.m., she had just left the hamlet of Givry and was walking toward' Fourchambault, following a road that went along the steep banks of the Loire, on the left bank. She suddenly found herself surrounded by a bright light, then saw descend in front of her, two large hands that violently pressed on her face. As ridiculous as it seems, these two hands were not attached to any body, but the victim had the impres- sion that they were pressing her head against an invisi- ble chest. This chest was as hard as iron. She strug- gled for seemingly long minutes against the grip of these two hands. She felt blows and was dragged across a thicket full of brambles toward a meadow. The pressure of the mysterious aggressor suddenly released and the phenomenon stopped. The young lady, very frightened, had returned to the road and come in sight of several houses, when she heard the sound of a violent breath and felt a strong movement of hot air. She saw trees bend over and there was again a bright light. She had the impres- sion that something was going by in the air at a great speed, but could see nothing. She finally found refuge and care with the lock attendants at Givry who took note of her state. When she got home, her family called the police who arrived quickly. In her testimony, she stated that the police went with her to the location and that they ascertained that the brambles were burned and flattened, that the acacias were partially burned and broken, and that the barbed wire and pickets of the fence were crushed and ripped. Other policemen came back several times to the site. Convinced of the reality of the attack, they printed an appeal for witnesses in the local paper. Case 3: April 10,1952, near NTmes (Gard) This exceptionally interesting story was the subject of a book, Rencontre avec les Extra-terrestres, published by Rocher, 1979. The book is by Rose C., the heroine of the adventure, but Charles Gouiran had a lot to do with the telling, and the preface is by Guy Tarade. It is thanks to Charles Gouiran and to Rose that we know about this affair. The book has been hard to find for a long time. Researchers who are interested in this case and will read the book will perhaps be put off by the fantastic quality of this tale. They should know that Rose, 40 years after the fact, still has two anatomical traits JANUARY 1994 NUMBER 309 PAGES"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL (apparently as rare as they are inexplicable) that she considers to have resulted from the incident. They should also know that the most remarkable of these traits is found in another of our 29 French cases (Case 6), which poses a problem... The abduction happened in the night of the 10th to the llth of April. Rose C. was 24 years old. Divorced for several months, she was the mother of a four-year- old daughter who was staying for 15 days with her paternal grandparents. Rose, who lived with her father, had come on a bicycle accompanied by her two dogs, to spend the night in a mazet (an outbuilding made of stone that can shelter one or two people and is primatively fur- nished). The mazet was fairly isolated and Rose was planning to do some work there the next day. She was awakened in the middle of the night by the dogs who were growling, but not barking. Worried, she went out and followed the dogs in the direction of another, smaller mazet which also belonged to her father. It was thus that she found herself in the presence of four strangers: one of normal size and three \"giants\" measuring about 2.30 or 2.40 meters tall. The one she called a \"normal man\" spoke perfect French and played the role of translator between Rose and the three giants, whom he introduced as coming from a faraway world. Aside from their extraordinary height, these giants could have passed for Hindus. Two of them looked athletic and spoke very little. The third, who seemed older, was apparently the chief. He had something like a black half marble in the middle of his forehead. He wore around his neck a strap holding some kind of box with buttons. The \"normal man\" explained that he himself had had a close encounter of the third kind 20 years earlier at the age of 25 and that he had been a teacher. Not having any family ties and being alone in the world, he had accepted the invitation of these extraterrestrials and lived since then with them. He had no regrets about his choice. When Rose was amazed that he looked so young for someone who should be 45, he explained that he was not that old, because \"up there time passes much less quickly.\" A s soon as he had explained that she had nothing to fear, the \"normal man\" told her that they would very much like, if possible, to take some books. Rose took them to the little mazet and gave them an old copy of The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas, as well as very old copies of a military medals magazine and a fashion magazine that she had bought that day. The former teacher explained to Rose that the Earth had been set up for use by its inhabitants by these extraterrestrials who had even put the Moon, reputed- ly a natural satellite, in place. But this human colony PAGE 6 on Earth had been something of a penal colony for banished individuals of whom we are the descendants. You must know, to appreciate this story fully, that Rose is a warm and voluble person. Very quickly, in spite of her initial fright, she felt very confident. When the strangers suggested taking her with them, howev- er, she withdrew and declined the invitation, explain- ing that she had a family and particularly a young child. It seems, moreover, that the chief, with the black marble on his forehead, had divined this even before Rose said anything, for he asked (always via the translator) \"Who is the old man, and who is the child?\" During the rest of the encounter, this \"man\" gave Rose the impression of having great wisdom and great physical power, and a strong feeling of affection grew rapidly between them. T hey showed her, practically invisible in a dark nook, the vehicle that they came in. It was enor- mous and had a shape like a straw hat. It was slate grey, parked about a meter above the ground and had no support between it and the ground, which amazed Rose. The visitors gave Rose a demonstration of their ability to levitate and teletransport objects. When they were inside the little mazet, the chief used the buttons on the little box he wore to dematerialize a rock. The rock reappeared outside the hut without the door hav- ing been opened. In addition, he raised up from a dis- tance some large rocks that floated in the air like bal- loons. But the words that the chief gave to Rose are much more interesting than the anti-gravity parlor tricks. Concerning a family of rats that had taken up house among the books in the mazet, he said that they should be allowed to live. These words and the quiet, gentle smile of the stranger reassured Rose. She said she would give bread to the rats tomorrow, but the giant told her that it was not good to do that either, because then they would become dependent on man. \"Don't kill the rats. And don't feed them.\" A little later, the teacher brought the conversation around to moral questions. He explained that they were there to take vegetation and mineral samples to evaluate the consequences of atomic explosions. It was an occasion for him to denounce the destructive and unthinking behavior of humans, their senseless acts toward not only their contemporaries, but also future generations. He made some remarks about cer- tain \"great men\" whose greatness was based on immense massacres and infinite miseries inflicted. He told Rose that because of Man, a cataclysm ravaged the planet 11,357 years before (9405 B.C). He dis- played great emotion in speaking of the beauty of the Earth and the foolish destruction of its inhabitants. Rose immediately shared this emotion. When she asked why the extraterrestrials did not intervene, the NUMBER 309    JANUARY 1994"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL teacher explained that each time they had tried to do so, no good had come of it. Rose didn't emphasize it in her account, but the parallel with the advice of the chief concerning the rats is obvious. Rose would have doubtless liked to continue the dialog, but the visitors told her they would have to leave. Reason given: Time spent on earth greatly tired the giants. They went aboard their device, having told Rose to get away from the ship and to hold the dogs. Rose tells in her book that following this encounter, she had a number of parapsychological experiences. She had the sensation of repeated psychic contact with these people. She also had premonitions of a series of experiences that related to catastrophes that happened after the encounter. There, briefly summed up, is the incredible story of Rose C. One notes certain partial similarities with other cases (notably that of Sospel), but above all we should mention one very important point that makes this affair much more credible. Soon after her adventure, Rose surprised herself in rubbing her right ring finger. A little while later, in looking at the finger, she noticed with amazement that it was as long as the middle finger. She compared it to her left hand, and came to the conclusion that follow- ing her encounter, the right ring finger had grown about eight or nine millimeters. T hink what we might, Rose's hand is there to bear witness. (We will see a second example of this phenomenon in Case 6.) In addition to the finger which apparently grew, a 1-centimeter long scar appeared at the same time in the middle of the palm of the same hand. The raised scar has not faded over the years. It is also important to note that a number of people, including the very reputable ufologist Charles Gouiran, have verified that in the mid-60s Rose did have precognitive or extrasensory perceptions. These are discussed in the book. Case 4:1954 in Yssingeaux (Haute-Loire) It is thanks to Pierre Guerin that we know about this case. The person involved is a professional clairvoy- ant whose abilities were tested by Remy Chauvin. Her gifts are real, but she does make mistakes. This is the case with the majority of these people, especially when they have chosen to use their skills on demand rather than accept them when they come spontaneous- iy. This lady lives in Paris and is today 48 years old. Her adventure, which according to her is what started her abilities, happened when she was 10. This puts it circa 1954. It was in summer when she was vacation- ing at her grandparents. After lunch she went out in the garden right next to the house. She saw a big light in front of her and lost consciousness. She came to at least an hour later, still on the prop- erty, but a bit more than a kilometer from her original location. She was in the middle of a wheat field, not knowing what had happened to her during this time nor how she had gotten to this spot. A typical example of missing time. From this day on, strange things happened to her. First, no one could touch her navel: it made her jump and was unbearable. Then, she became psychic. In the beginning, she was very upset when she realized that she was frequently reading the thoughts of her family, thinking they could also read her thoughts. Later, as a young boarder, she experienced a number of strange events that she could never explain. Balls and bars danced, sometimes in front of her. When she separated from her husband, a few years ago, she thought about using her gifts commercially and built up a clientele. She refuses to be hypnotized, fearing she will lose her abilities which are her liveli- hood. She also refuses to be read by any of her col- leagues. One notes how much her account is like that of Alicia Isabel Desvoignes in LDLN 305, pp. 24 and 25. Case 5:1961 or 1962 near Bray-sur-Seine What is interesting in the case of Michel (now age 49) is the scar on the edge of his hand, the cause of which he does not know. He lost his mother at the age of 13 and remembers frequently asking her about the origin of the scar. She was never able to give him any expla- nation for it. This indicates that the injury goes back to early childhood, of which he does not remember too much, and gives rise to the question: Can we imagine a mother of a very young child not remem- bering what caused a wound that leaves a scar still very visible 45 years later? [Michel's story concerns an encounter that] occurred one evening in 1961 or 1962. The exact date is for the moment unknown. We know only that it was a Sunday, probably around the month of November. Michel came out of a movie theatre at 5:30 p.m. (We know the theatre and we know the film so we can find the exact date with a bit of research which is cur- rently underway.) It was already dark. His adoptive father was playing cards in a nearby cafe and he decided to go alone on his bike back home to their isolated farm. He had a good kilometer left to go when he noticed, corning from the far left (south- east) of the courtyard of the farm, a steady beam of light rising vertically to the sky. He thought of auto- mobile headlights, but the light was orange-red, and the cylinder of light, with defined edges, rose very high in the sky. JANUARY 1994 NUMBER 309 PAGE 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL The closer Michel came to the farm, the less he understood what was going on. At the entrance of the farm (a big farm with annexed buildings arranged around a large court surrounded by high walls) he put down his bike and walked around the buildings from the outside of the surrounding wall. He came upon an enormous object sitting on the ground, about 50 meters away. The upper cupola, which had portholes, was turn- ing. [See drawing below] The lower part was cylindri- cal and had a large vertical opening. He could see the brightly illuminated inside. It seemed that the lower side of the cylinder was not resting directly on the ground, but that the device was suspended in the air. Michel continued to approach. He slipped under the flat, central part of the object to where he could look through the opening to the interior. The most amazing thing was that the interior of the cylinder was immense. Incomparably larger than the cylinder seen from the outside. B efore continuing with this story, we must empha- size that several examples of this \"it's not big out- side, but there's so much room inside\" syndrome exist in the UFO literature. Leonard Stringfield presented an example in LDLN 297, p. 10, and there is a more classic example in the story of Carl Higdon concern- ing his abduction in Medicine Bow, Wyoming in 1974 in Flying Saucer Review, vol. 21, nos. 3 and 4. As long as UFO stories include this kind of information, we cannot be too surprised that ufology has a bad rep- utation and that many people dismiss it. However, Michel appears to be as credible as anyone can be and his story is clear and coherent. Without going so far as to speculate on what infer- nal characteristic of the universe can, at least as far as appearances go, contain a larger volume within a smaller volume, we can simply state that accounts of close encounters have an absurd, even revolting, qual- ity which could be nothing more than a highly devel- oped form of camouflage. It is enough to imagine that the phenomenon could plant false memories in the minds of its victims. Michel stopped just In front of the opening, but did not go In. Nor did he touch the edges of the opening. He described the inte- rior of the cylinder as immense — at least six meters in diameter, which was about four times the diameter of the exterior. Michel stopped just in front of the opening, but did not go in. Nor did he touch the edges of the opening. He described the interior of the cylinder as follows: It was immense—at least six meters in diameter, which was about four times the diameter of the exterior. When he looked up, he could see nothing resembling a ceiling. All around the huge cylindrical room, he saw a variety of apparatuses holding moving lights, \"luminous dials in many colors with characters that moved.\" The dominant colors were \"light violet and deep salmon.\" Near, but not at the center was a vertical column that seemed be- tween 70 centimeters and 1 meter in diameter and that turned around its axis. What made this rotation visible was something like a cable, wound like a helix around the column, \"like a snake.\" [See drawing on page 9] A ccording to Michel's memory, he was watching this incredible spectacle when the sound of a fan, coming apparently from above, began and increased in intensity as the rotation of the column increased and the dials became brighter. That was when he was thrown back about four or five meters. The portholes on the cupola turned very fast. The opening closed and the cylinder went up into the body of the object. The object became luminous—a bright orange. It tipped, rose, and in an instant disappeared toward the south. In five sec- onds, it looked like an ordinary star. Michel got up, wading in mud. It was dark. He was not sick after his adventure and does not know whether the object left traces in the soil—he did not think to look. He does remember that the year after, seven apple trees died that were around the courtyard wall only several meters from the object. Michel did not tell anyone his story before 1978. We took his story in 1988 and in 1992. From the time of the event to the present, Michel has experienced some unexplainable and generally un- pleasant events. These events don't relate directly to UFOs, but rather to the paranormal. Two of them are en- counters with unbelievable creatures that took place on January 19 and April 15, 1988 (probable dates). No flying object was seen at the time of these encounters, which recall the account of Paula and Ron Watson in LDLN 311, pp. 15-18. Nothing about this case puts it in the category of an abduction in the strict sense or even in a broad sense. The witness does not remember having lost control over his movements, except for the brief moment when he PAGES NUMBER 309 JANUARY 1994"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL \" was \"ejected.\" And it would be an exaggeration to say that the encounter took him out of his familiar universe. Why then include this affair? For the following rea- son: this case comprises at least three characteristics that we find in numerous abduction cases. The most important is the scar, still visible 30 years after the en- counter (as well as before the encounter). It seems to me that when the link between the witness and the phe- nomenon is so deep, so obscure, and repeated over time, there is no argument against comparing it to an abduc- tion. Let us insist on the fact that concrete situations are sometimes (as here) very complex. This makes the no- tion of an abduction applicable, particularly in this do- main where there is always doubt. The limits are never clearly delineated. Case 6: April 1969 in Baiizac (Gironde) The way in which Catherine's case was discovered, almost by chance, in October 1988, is worth telling. This case actually is a striking analogy to that of Rose C., and one should not suspect that Catherine was inspired by Rose's tale. I can affirm that Catherine, at that time, had never heard of Rose. I can add that she also had no knowledge of or interest in ufology. However, during a meal (lunch) with friends, she suddenly brought up an observation made by one of her sisters (close sighting of a nocturnal light). I had met Rose C. some fifteen days earlier and had been impressed by the two anomalies on her right hand. In addition, I had read some accounts of American abductions that mentioned scars and had made the connection. I asked Catherine if by any chance her sis- ter had had an unexplained scar after her sighting. Catherine, a bit surprised, said, \"No.\" Then after a few seconds added, \"A scar—I have one...\" She showed us a scar, not very noticeable, on the outside of her left ankle. She began to tell us the ori- gin of the scar, which we will see is not clearly defined. It happened when she was about 17, around April 1969. She was on vacation at her godmother's in Baiizac. She was sleeping alone in a room with a fire- place, but other family members were sleeping in the house. Her memories are both succinct and a bit unclear. One night something interrupted her sleep. It was fair- ly scary, but she is sure that it is something other than a nightmare. She has a vague memory of small people, light colored—maybe white, near the fireplace. She was afraid, but curiously, instead of crying for help, she hid under the covers. The next morning, she had a bad injury on her ankle. It was all black, but not very painful, and total- ly inexplicable, especially since Catherine was not a sleepwalker. Several doctors verify the existence of this wound, whose appearance (particularly the black color) did not suggest any satisfactory explanation. What is particularly bothersome is that this wound did not scar up for a year and a half. A few hours later, I was again with Catherine and since our lunchtime conversation had taken a surreal- istic turn, I wanted to explain the reasons for my inter- est in her story. I told her very briefly Rose C.'s story. When I told her about the finger that had grown, Catherine held out her right hand and said, \"Ah, yes. Like this?\" S he had the same anomaly as Rose C, on the same finger. (She does not however have any scar in the palm of her hand.) Naturally, after this revelation, which I shared wtih a few friends, we tried to find a third person with this anomaly. We haven't found one. When I had the plea- sure of meeting Budd Hopkins in Paris two years ago, I spoke to him about this and asked if he knew of any similar cases. He had never come across any. It is only recently, mid-November 1992, that Claude Raffy found a third example to start up the inquiry into the mystery of right-hand ring fingers that grow. The investigation on this third case has just started. The two cases of Rose and Catherine exist. If an official body wants to verify this, we will furnish all the initial data. And doubtless, Rose and Catherine will not refuse to be examined as long as their anonymity is guaranteed. I don't know what one should think of this enigma. But we must be careful. We must not exclude the pos- sibility of a common, but little known anomaly. But we must find out. I asked Dr. Duroux, a doctor and JANUARY 1994 NUMBER 309 PAGE 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL ufologist. He did not know about this anomaly and gave me a book Cahier d'enseignment de la Societe Franfaise de chirurgle de la main [French Society of Hand Surgery Teaching Notebook] which described a number of hand malformations, but did not address our problem. Another doctor/ufologist also had no knowledge of this anatomical peculiarity. [Mr. Mesnard would like to see an official body undertake a serious scientific study of these finger anomalies...Any takers?] Case 7: October or November 1974 in a village of the Aisne region In this case there was no abduction in the strict sense, but we will see a detail that lets us interpret this close encounter as an attempted abduction. Around 2:00 in the afternoon on a beautiful autumn Sunday, Alain G. and Patrick V. got into the [vehicle] belonging to Patrick to go for an outing. They hadn't left the town limits before they decided to take another route. They planned to make a U-turn a bit further on. It was thus that Patrick stopped in front of the last house in the village (on their right) with the intention of backing up and continuing in the opposite direc- tion. But he stopped, frozen like his friend, by the amazing spectacle in the courtyard of the house. Five characters, the likes of which they had never seen before, were in this courtyard. Three of them were in the background, to the left. Another walked slowly along the front of the house and touched it with two hands. The fifth, in the middle of the courtyard, faced the two automobilists. Alain G., the passenger, who had the bad idea to open the right, front window, found himself only three meters from this being. He felt his blood turn to ice water in his veins. During some very long seconds nothing happened. The car engine turned slowly. The five characters were alike in physique and clothing. All about 1.30 meters tall, they were dressed in long dresses that almost reached the ground and were decorated with multicolor spots. The skin on their faces and hands was an earthy yellow, and their enormous eyes were black hemispheres, the size of billard balls. They had long hair, that fell down their backs to their waists. Their noses were compressed inward. Their mouths were always shut. The being that was walking along the facade of the house was frozen in place and the one close to the wit- nesses seemed to smile at them. This face-to-face immobility lasted a while, then the closest being gestured with arm and hand as if to say, \"Come.\" This was too much and the two men panicked. Alain screamed, \"Move it! Move it!\" His friend, with difficulty, put the car into reverse and backed up, turning into a space left open by a delapi- dated barn, and took off for the town. Shortly after, they came back with some other peo- ple, but no one was there. They went back to the vil- lage, then came back to the house again later, with other people. Everything appeared normal. The investigation eight months later established that in the early afternoon a neighbor had noticed little people on the road in front of the house. Having seen them from a distance, he thought they were \"children dressed in yellow oilcloth\" which had surprised him. Nothing permits us to say whether this episode hap- pened before or after a close encounter. Case 8: September 1975 near Bonnieux (Vaucluse) If many abductions seem like nightmares, there are others that seem like fairy tales. Here is a fine exam- ple of the latter. This account also needs verification that only an official service can provide. Jean-Pierre Thibaud first brought this story to our attention, and Gilles Garreau investigated the person to whom it happend on September 30, 1992. Here is his report: In 1973, Mrs. Denise B. was 49. Her husband had left her and she was suffering from severe psychologi- cal stress. At the beginning of the year she had left Marseille and her work in a factory at Aubagne. She also had a throat cancer at this time. She had begun chemotherapy treatments in 1973 in the Timone hospital in Marseille. Mrs. B says that at the time she had no reflex actions left, that she was partially para- lyzed. Her 17-year old son was in Thiers high school in Marseille and had a room away from home in the city. So Mrs. B. tried living outside of Marseille for a change of scene. In 1974 while her son was still a stu- dent in Marseille, she decided to settle in the place called Les Crests, about 4 kilometers south-south west of Bonnieux. Weakened by her treatments, she decid- ed to stop taking all medicines and went only once a month to the Timone hospital for medical follow-up. On August 15 they had told her that her condition was worse and that she had to come to the hospital on September 15. On September 14, 1975 she was get- ting ready to go to the hospital. She was alone and there was no one and no traffic in the area. In the evening, around 9:00 p.m., she decided to walk along the Chemin du Lot, as she did every evening, to relax. She heard the church bells in Bonnieux ring 9:00. It was dark, there was a slight wind, and the stars were visible. She was accompanied by a little dog. She went toward the place called La Chambarelle (dragging her feet because she had difficulty walking). She saw her dog disappear in the copse. When she got to an eleva- tion of pine trees situated a dozen meters on her left, she had the impression of \"having all her insides mixed up,\" and felt obliged to leave the road. Using PAGE 10 NUMBER 309 JANUARY 1994"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL her flashlight, she went toward a stone drain to be quiet a bit. Feeling intensely tired, Mrs. B. wanted then to get back to the road from which she was separated by an embankment. Her feet dragging, she went to where the embankment was flatter. It was then that her flash- light stopped working. All of a sudden, she had the impression that four fingers, or rather four sausages, were pressing the back of her neck, which made her lift her head. She then saw a lighted beam coming from above onto the trees. She was paralyzed, shoulders frozen. Her feet became very heavy. Shortly after, she felt that her feet were in the air, that they were not touching the ground. The illuminated beam, whose source was much higher than the top of the pines, was pale yellow and moved in place. Suddenly another light appeared at the base of a pine which was 12 meters from her. It was a rectangle, red-orange in color and relatively small. This light disappeared when Mrs. B. was no more than five meters from it. Instinctively, she got back on the road walking in the direction of the farm at Les Crests. Thinking about what had happened to her, she retraced her steps. Her legs no longer hurt. Arriving at the left side of the road, not far from the pine, she felt an intense cold, as if she was in a refrigerator. She then had the impression that \"something else was working on her will.\" She was frightened and wanted to run, but in fact returned calmly. Five to seven minutes had passed while she had stayed near the tree. The dog came back and showed no signs of trouble. Getting home, Mrs. B. went to bed. The next day in the hospital, the medical assistant examined her: no more cancer! This was confirmed by another doctor and she was told she could go home. But she was not given her medical record. Looking back, Mrs. B. remembers having seen, while she was walking home, a close formation of stars in the south toward the tree. The stars masked the sky. Mrs. B. did not confide in anyone until, seven years later, she asked one of the police officers of Bonnieux whether what she had seen was a paralyzing ray of the army. He explained that that was impossible. Mrs. B. remembers having seen, before her healing, lights above the openness, from a rocky outcrop in Luberon. not far from Robion. She was with her son. She is not religious and does not think her experi- ence either evil or divine. To the doctor that ques- tioned her in the Timone hospital after her healing, she said it was goat's milk that cured her. The day after her clean bill of health on September 15, the doctor at work considered her fit to work. She went back to work and had several jobs: invoice clerk. checker, and got her driver's license in 1977 while working for the Red Cross. She assured me that she had not thought about UFOs in 1975. Only after long consideration did she consult books on the subject in the library. Around 1978, she again saw lights that moved in front of her, above Val du Loup, near her home. They were orangey-red lights that disappeared in place. In all her sightings, Mrs. B. noticed no noise nor odor, but in 1975 she afterward had a feeling of pro- tection. Today she is retired and living in an apartment. She does not smoke and does do some sports. At almost 70, she is mentally sharp. She hopes her experience can be useful to medicine, saying \"If only this miracle could lead to a cure for cancer...\" Case 9: June 11, 1976 in Chatuzange-le-Goubet (Drome) From an historical point of view, this story occupies a special place in the list of 29 French abductions. This one is the first to be given attention by the sensational press and even the television. It also marks the first local use of a controversial investigative technique: hypnosis. Michel Figuet told this story in issue number 14 (1976) of the bulletin of the Drome-Ardeche UFO investigation commission, UFO Informations, pub- lished by the Society of Friends of Marc Thirouin (AAMT), today disbanded. Around 1:15 in the morning, a 21-year old woman, Helene Guiliana left Romans to return home to Hostun. She was alone in her car. She left National Route 92 and took a right onto a little road that crossed the Isere river and got onto National Route 531 (now N. 532) on the south bank. She went two kilometers on this road and was in Le Martinet when the incident occurred. The car slowed down as if it were running out of gas. However, the needle on the dashboard indicated that the tank was not empty. Suddenly, all the car lights went out and the motor stopped. Helene then saw a luminous orange hemisphere on the road about 15 meters in front of her. Frightened, she locked the doors and put her hands over her eyes. A very long moment passed. When Helene looked again, the luminous mass had disappeared. She turned the key, started up, and continued her journey. She was so upset that three kilometers further in L'Ecanciere, she forgot to make a right turn which resulted in making her trip longer. When she got home, her sister pointed out that it was four o'clock in the morning! Almost two and a half hours had passed of which she had no memory. An excellent example of missing time. JANUARY 1994 NUMBER 309 PAGE I 1"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Very soon, due to a local journalist, the affair received publicity rarely accorded close encounters. On July 12 it was covered in two papers, Le Progres de Lyon and Le Dauphine Libere. It is true that the story is not ordinary. How could the car sit, lights out on the edge of a busy road, without causing an acci- dent and without anyone stopping for a close look? How could this luminous mass on the road not inter- fere with the heavy traffic at this time of year? And how could this young woman cover her eyes at 1:15 a.m. and not uncover them until 3:45? All these questions spurred an investigator, Andre Revol, to call on the services of a hypnotist known in the region under the pseudonym of Stephane Dey. The results of this session were announced on FR3 [TV channel 3] and in Le Dauphine Libere of August 13. A second session took place August 18 in the presence of several journalists. The young woman's story as revealed under hypnosis was published in issue 1564 of France Dimanche, as well as in Le Progres, and several other journals, including Nostra. What Helene Guiliana revealed under hypnosis was startling: two dwarfs came up to the car and took her into a device that was at the heart of the luminous mass. There, they laid her on a table and one of them, using a sort of flashlight, made circles of light on her sweater. Everything in the round room seemed metal- lic, and there were white, red, and yellow lights. The young woman described her abductors as fol- lows: they were small (coming up only to the level of her chest), ugly, with a small squashed nose and a tiny mouth. They were dressed in one-piece, form-fitting suits that covered their heads. The two notable differ- ences between her statements of July 22 and August 18 concern the color of their skin (first yellow, then normal) and the color of their suits (violet, then black). These dwarfs made a lot of gestures, as if they were annoyed at not being able to make their captive under- stand something. Finally, they took her back to her car. The information she gave under hypnosis concern- ing the events does not fill the two-and-a-half-hour gap, which leads one to think that if the information is accurate, it is incomplete. The comportment of the hypnotist has been heavily criticised: he has been particularly brought to task for working without medical controls and for using lead- ing questions. In other words, he has been accused of lacking in rigor and using theatrical hypnotism and of spoiling the case. These criticisms are not without basis, but may also be biased. On December 17, 1992, Christian Jay reached the young lady of this story who is today married and the mother of a family. She confirmed the reality of the events of June 11, including the missing time. On looking back, she has another opinion of the two hyp- notic regressions she underwent. Here is what Christian Jay wrote concerning this: \" ...I was convinced that a certain kind of investiga- tion was totally disastrous for any advancement of knowledge. In fact, the conditions in which H. G. dis- covered what had happened to her were much more disturbing than the events themselves, and she was very specific about not believing anything that she revealed under hypnosis. She is certain that they made it all up for media publicity.\" That the young lady has an unpleasant memory of the two sessions, we can easily believe, especially since their exploitation by the media (both showy and brief) created a difficult situation for her in the coun- try. But must we throw out for good the elements revealed by hypnosis? Has the reputation of the hyp- notist (further aggravated by another affair two years later) influenced a judgement of the results them- selves? The link between the obligation of the hypnotist and the results is not so obvious. It is even less obvi- ous when the two-and-a-half-hour memory gap remains, even if we throw out the two dwarfs with the bathwater of the method. Again, the similarity between the young woman's story and many analagous accounts obtained by the same method (notably in the US) is surprising. The thick dossier of American abductions is not exactly a secret today since Communion by Whitley Strieber has been trans- lated in French and since at least two magazines with a large circulation covered [a meeting] in New York last year. But in 1976, things were different. Only three cases had any serious coverage outside the ufo- logical community. These were the case of Betty and Barney Hill, described succinctly in France Dimanche, issue 1093 in 1966; case number 3 in our list (April 10, 1952) which had few points in common with Helene's case; and the story of Paulo Caetano, told in the first book by Jean-Claude Bourret, La nou- velle vague des soucoupes volantes, published by France Empire, 1975. Case 10: Beginning of summer 1976 in Steenvoorde (Nord) We don't need to spend much time on this case of missing time because it is covered in detail in Lumieres Dans La Nuit, No. 305, p. 23. Briefly, near midnight, a truck driver noticed a luminous mass which stopped near the road. The truck driver stopped, got out of the truck, and cautiously approached to within 120 to 150 meters of the thing. After a while he returned to his truck to continue on his journey, but the diesel engine truck would not start—something which had never happened before. When the luminous mass departed, the truck started up on the first try. PAGE 12 NUMBER 309 JANUARY 1994"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL When he got home, the truck driver discovered that it was after 2:00 in the morning when it should only have been around 12:30, taking into account the time at the beginning of the encounter, the time during which he remembered observing the object, and the distance traveled. For 13 years, only his wife knew about this affair. When he told us about it on July 13, 1989, we asked him if he had been frightened and he replied: \"...frightened...without being frightened...It's a fear you can't explain.\" [This series will be continued in a future issue of the Journal.

FUND QUARTERLY REPORT During this quarter, the Fund participated in an unprecedented effort to launch a legal inquiry into the Roswell UFO crash case. The effort was initiated by a supporter who donated $20.000 to pay the retainer fees required by a prestigious Washington, D.C., law firm to interview individuals who are said to have had an operational involvement in the recovery of a craft and bodies. The supporter donated an additional $2,000 to pay for travel costs for investigators to introduce these witnesses to the lawyers. After ascer- taining the facts in the case and assessing the credibili- ty of the witnesses, the law firm will recommend fur- ther possible legal action. More on this project will be reported in the future. In the meantime, the effort to launch a congression- al inquiry into the Roswell case is proceeding. A Member of the U.S. House of Representatives is mak- ing official inquiries into the matter, and a request for a congressional investigation is expected in the near future. It is hoped that the investigation will lead to hearings, which will produce more witnesses and more evidence, into the apparent recovery of a craft and bodies outside Roswell, N.M., in July 1947. Thanks to those who responded to our most recent appeal, the Fund was able to fully support half of the costs of an ongoing abduction database project being coordinated by researcher Dan Wright. The Fund and the Mutual UFO Network are sharing the costs of the $7,000 project, which involves making transcriptions of hypnosis sessions with abduction witnesses and entering the material into a computer database. The information will be made available to a select group of qualified researchers. We're pleased to report that the recipient of this year's Isabel Davis Award, as selected by our support- ers, is Raymond Fowler, investigator and author of six books on the UFO subject. Mr. Fowler will receive an award in the amount of $1,000. The Isabel L. Davis Memorial Award was established in 1986 \"to recog- nize long-term accomplishments and excellence in promoting rational inquiry into reported UFO sight- ings and related phenomena.\" The Fund's major public education project during this period was coordination of a seminar, \"Mysteries of the Sky,\" at a community college in the Washington, D.C., area. Members of the Fund's Executive Committee and other researchers combined their talents to make presentations on several signifi- cant aspects of the UFO phenomenon. A videotape of the proceedings is now available; please write for more information. The Executive Committee wishes to acknowledge the support of the International UFO Center, a muse- um in Orlando, Fla., for its contribution of $80 in September. The museum is donating to the Fund 25 cents out of each $2 admission fee received. If you are in the Orlando area, be sure to stop by the International UFO Museum, located at 7227 International Drive, Orlando, FL 32819. During this period, the Fund received requests for grants totalling more than $58,000, which far exceeds the amount we have in uncommitted funds. While many of the proposals are worthwhile, they cannot be consid- ered unless we have a fund which can be held in reserve for serious scientific research into the UFO phenome- non. Therefore, we are establishing a Long-Term Fund to support future projects. Write us at Fund for UFO Research, PO Box 277, Mt. Rainier, MD 20712.

By Paul Cerny I n 1971, after I had completed a lecture on UFOs to a local group in California, a distinguished looking gentleman came up to the podium with a photo in hand. During the ensuing discussion I learned that he was a trained scientist with a Ph.D. in biochemistry, had been a Navy officer during World War II and was currently employed as a consultant by a major logging company. The photo that he showed me had been taken at Willamette Pass in Oregon in November, 1966. It showed a domed disk-like object with a series of dark and light bands underneath resembling secondary im- ages (cover). However, the man stated that the object he had seen looked like the top portion of the photo only and did not have the banded structure underneath. He said that he saw the object in his viewfinder and after he snapped the photo he looked up and saw the object shoot off to the right and upward reaching a cloud bank above the distant mountains in about 3 seconds. Later, 1 had him fill out the standard NICAP UFO report and forwarded it to our headquarters office in Washington, D.C. During the next 10 years the UFO community was di- vided on the authenticity of the photo with NICAP tak- ing a \"doubtful\" position and with photoanalyst Adrian Vance and Dr. J. Allen Hynek taking a positive one. The photo was often displayed at UFO Conferences and appeared in at least two books, several UFO publi- cations and some television documentaries. In 1980 I became aquainted with Dr. Irwin Wieder, a physicist who expressed an interest in the photo be- cause he thought that the difference between what the witness saw and what he photographed might offer clues as to what was propelling the object. I introduced him to the witness and after numerous interviews Wieder began to formulate a possible reason for the difference. In 1981 he presented his preliminary ideas on the photo at the CUFOS conference in Chicago. After a time he began to realize that his proposed mechanisms fell short of explaining the photo and in 1982 he temporarily abandoned the project. In 1989, Wieder again took up the investigation but this time with more attention to the possibility that the photo was not a picture of a UFO. After numerous false starts he zeroed in on the idea that maybe the photo was that of a sign off the road and taken from a moving car. This, even though the witness repeatedly denied having taken any pictures from his moving car on that trip. After a considerable amount of investigation Wieder visited the State sign shop in Salem, Oregon and estab- lished that the only sign at the Willamette Pass turnouts was the sign shown in the photo below. Wieder also obtained the specificatons of this sign from state personnel and fabricated a duplicate. Judging from the amount of snow on the trees in the Oreqon Photo and the snowbank in the foreground, Wieder as- sumed that on the day the photo was taken, Nov. 22, 1966, there was also snow on top of the sign. He then took the liberty of adding a white strip to the top of the sign including the protruding top of the post to simulate a blanket of snow. (The original sign was thick enough to support this kind of a blanket of snow). After a series of trial runs taking snap shots of the fabricated sign from a moving car he succeeded in pro- ducing the photo shown on page 15. This has all the es- sential features of the original photograph and yet it is only a picture of a sign taken from a moving car. The motion of the car blurred the image of the sign so that the snow blanket became the blurred image of a disk, the letters and spaces between the lines became the dark and light bands and the post was spread to look like a vapor trail. Wieder also verified mathematically that the sign at the turnout was at the correct distance from the road for the sign to produce an image of the measured size on the film in the witness' camera. Thus a well known UFO photograph has been shown to be an ordinary object. For a more complete and de- tailed description of the steps and reasoning used in this investigation the reader is referred to Dr. Wieder's original article, \"The Willamette Pass Oregon UFO Photo Revisited: An Explanation,\" in the Journal For Scientific Exploration, Volume 7, No. 2. 1993. PACE 14 NUMBER 309 JANUARY 1994"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Excerpt From Dr. Irwin Wleder's Original Article Implications for UFO Research Investigator Polarization In this investigation progress was hampered for some time because the author stayed in a pure belief mode. What is especially revealing is that the author remained temporarily oblivious to an abundance ot\" evidence that should have signaled something was wrong. If anything can be learned from this, it is that UFO researchers need to be more diligent in applying the principles of scien- tific research. As is well known but not always applied, this means that one must be dedicated to the truth and be willing to accept the results of an inquiry without personal bias. Witness Reliability This work demonstrates that our criteria for judging the reliability of a witness are inadequate. In this investigation the witness was judged on the basis of his high level of education, his level of attainment and special training in the military, his professional success, and his desire for anonymity. All these factors contributed to a highly credible witness according to conventional wisdom, and were key to the author stubbornly staying in the belief mode. It is not obvious that anything can be done about improving this situation. If a witness with these credentials cannot be believed then it appears that the concept of advancing a field on the basis of witness reports may be flawed. Effect of Witness Reliability on Research Results In the case of statistical studies of the UFO phenomenon there is a danger that by simply tabu- lating the number of sightings with a particular attribute, such as time of day or some observed side effect, any conclusions that are drawn may be skewed by the possibility that the overwhelming majority of the data points may be false or inaccu- rate. This problem may be addressed by choosing only cases with uncoupled multiple witnesses. While this would greatly reduce the size of the statistical samples it might also increase the chance of meaningful results. In the case of alleged contacts and abductions by extraterrestrials we have a much more serious prob- lem. Because of the very nature of the field the ev- idence is gathered predominantly from the percep- tions of single witnesses. Even assuming that the majority of these witnesses believe what they are saying, there is the problem of determining if some or all of their descriptions are generated by internal rather than external stimuli. The task of formulating valid criteria for believing such witnesses may be formidable if not impossible. —Dr. Irwin Wieder Reprinted with the permission of the Journal of Scientific Exploration.

By Keith Basterfield The Fantasy-Prone Personality (FPP) hypothesis, as a possible explanation for alien abduction accounts, was first proposed by Robert E. Bartholomew, and myself, in 1988. The hypothesis is a falsifiable, testable one and has generated much debate since then. However, of late, some inaccurate statements have been made in some quarters about the hypothesis, and even about the FPP itself. It therefore appears timely to review the cur- rent status of the debate. DISCOVERY From the outset it should be stated that the FPP itself is a finding of mainstream psychology. By the way, I con- sider the words \"fantasy-prone\" to be a poor choice, and would prefer the more neutral \"imagery-prone.\" In the early 1980's, two American psychologists, Sheryl C. Wilson and Theodore X. Barber, stumbled over a new type of personality which they came to call the fantasy-prone personality (Wilson & Barber 1981, 1982, 1983.) Amongst their findings from a group of women who rated as excellent hypnotic subjects were: 1) 60% of FPP subjects reported they had a false pregnancy at least once. They believed they were preg- nant, and typical symptoms of pregnancy occurred. Two even went for abortions, following which they were told that no fetus had been found. In the control group 16% of the women experienced false pregnancies but no \"missing fetus.\" 2) With their eyes open, 65% of the FPP subjects experienced their \"imagery\" as \"real as real\" in all sense modes. 3) The fantasies had a life of their own, they were not directed or controlled by the subject. 4) 75% of FPP subjects could achieve sexual orgasm by mental fantasy alone. 5) As children, the FPP subjects lived in a make-be- lieve world of their own construction. 6) When they were children, almost all the subjects believed in fairies, leprechauns, elves, and other such be- ings. 7) 58% of the FPP subjects, as opposed to 8% of the control group, had childhood imaginary companions whom they described as \"real\" to them. 8) Most FPP subjects had an incredible memory recall for childhood events, beyond that of most people. 9) 92% of the FPP subjects saw themselves as psy- chic and reported numerous telepathic and precognitive experiences, compared to 16% of the control sample. 10) 88% of the FPP subjects, as compared to 8% of the controls, reported out-of-body experiences. 11) 50% of FPP subjects, as opposed to 8% of the controls, reported an ability to perform automatic writ- ing. 12) 66% of FPP subjects reported a perceived ability to perform healings, which none of the control group did. 13) 73% of FPP subjects and 16% of the controls re- ported experiencing apparitions. 14) On the question of hypnagogic imagery upon falling asleep, 64% of FPP subjects, compared to 8% controls, reported frequent imagery as they fell asleep. It should be noted here that all the FPP subjects were socially aware, happy, normal, healthy individuals, free of psychopathology. They were all excellent hypnotic subjects. Since then, other psychologists have extended this work and confirmed that about 4% of the general American population fits into this personality type, which is not detectable on standard psychological tests. (Lynn & Rhue, 1986,1987,1988; Myers & Austrin, 1985; Rhue & Lynn 1987a,1987b,1989.) BARTHOLOMEW AND BASTERFIELD Having come across the research of Wilson and Barber, I mentioned the relevance of it as regards abduction re- search, as I saw it, to Robert E. Bartholomew, an American Ph.D. student in Sociology at Flinders University in my home town of Adelaide, South Australia. Bob and I had corresponded previously about hypnagogic and hypnopompic imagery. We saw that: • Many abductees who had undergone regression hypnosis were rated as \"excellent\" hypnotic subjects by the person performing the hypnosis. This fact is itself interesting, in that only a small percentage of the general population are in fact \"excellent\" subjects. • Female abductees were reporting pregnancies and then \"missing fetuses.\" This unusual claim closely matched the experience of two FPP subjects. • If abductions were internally generated FPP im- agery then they could appear as \"real as real.\" • My own research revealed that local abductees were reporting having above average memory recall for very early childhood events. • Many abductees reported that they were either psychic prior to their abductions, or that their psychic experiences blossomed after the abduction. We therefore felt that there were enough parallels between the FPP and abductions to warrant further re- search. However, it became evident to us that UFO re- searchers had not gathered sufficiently in-depth data PAGE 16 NUMBER 309 JANUARY 1994"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL about abductees to test the hypothesis that abductees would rate higher on psychological instruments mea- suring fantasy-proneness than the average population. Tt surprised us that some abduction researchers pos- sessed pools of hundreds of cases but had carried out lit- tle to no scientific work on the psychology of abduc- tions. So, we decided on another approach. We examined the biographical details of 152 individuals who had been classified as either a contactee or an abductee. We found these subjects to be remarkably devoid of any psychopathology. However, in 132 cases, one or more major characteristics of FPP were noted. This led us to propose that a closer examination be undertaken of a sample of abductees (Bartholomew et al, 1991.) This suggestion met with a range of responses. These ranged from agreement that here, for the first time, was a testable, falsifiable, scientific hypothesis; to outright re- jection. Interestingly, the rejection came from researchers without them carrying out any actual testing. Fortunately, some individuals did decide to undertake a scientific analysis of the hypothesis. TESTING The first was undertaken by U.S. psychologists Kenneth Ring and Christopher Rosing of the Psychology Department of the University of Connecticut. Some 264 individuals, a mix of UFO encounterers, near-death experiencers, and controls, engaged in a mail question- naire survey: 97 UFO encounterers; 39 persons inter- ested in UFOs but having no significant UFO experi- ence; 74 persons who had undergone a near-death ex- perience, and 54 persons interested in near-death expe- riences, were sampled. Quoting from the report: \"Results showed that per- sons reporting abductions were psychologically indis- tinguishable from those who had other types of UFO en- counters. However, UFO experiencers in general, while not more fantasy-prone than their controls, reported more sensitivity to non-ordinary realities as children as well as a higher incidence of child abuse and traumas than controls.\" (Ring & Rosing 1990:59). The FPP hypothesis, that UFO experiencers, includ- ing abductees, would tend to be more fantasy-prone than controls was not born out in this study. The second study, undertaken by the J. Allen Hynek Centre for UFO Studies, of solely abductees, was in part testing the FPP hypothesis, while addressing the wider question of psychological characteristics of ab- ductees. Quoting their 1992 paper reporting their findings: \"Using the ICMI plus MMPI profile data, we found that our subjects as a whole cannot be characterised as fantasy-prone. Does this put an end to the hypothesis of Bartholomew and Basterfield? It is tempting to say yes, but here is a better answer. First, no study in the social or psychological sciences is ever definitive when a field, JANUARY 1994    NUMBER 309 like abduction research, is in its infancy...Second, our sample size is small and could be affected by chance variation. But third and most important, it is our judge- ment that the abduction phenomenon is multicausal and that several mechanisms may be generating relatively similar reports.\" (Rodeghier et al, 1992:80). So, a testable, falsifiable scientific hypothesis was proposed by Bob and myself. It has twice been tested and appears not to explain the totality of abductions. Further studies of the FPP hypothesis come to mind. For example, although the Hopkins/Jacobs genetic en- gineering hypothesis indicates that all female abductees would have been impregnated and their fetuses stolen, Jean Mundy's analysis of Omni magazine's survey in- dicated only some 9% of female abductees recalled a \"missing fetus.\" It would therefore be interesting to de- termine if female abductees with \"missing fetus\" recall were more fantasy-prone than a control sample. Perhaps some elements of abductions have psychological coun- terparts. ALTERNATIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL HYPOTHESES Does this indicate that we should consider that psycho- logical hypotheses in general cannot explain abduc- tions? I would argue not, for both the Ring and Rosing, and CUFOS studies, together with the original study by Slater in the 80's clearly indicates that abductees are not typical of the general population. Citing Slater: \"To summarise, while this is a hetero- geneous group in terms of overt personality style, it can be said that most of its members share being rather unusual and very interesting. They...share...a certain richness of inner life...Shared underlying emo- tional factors include a degree of identity disturbance, some deficits in the interpersonal sphere, and general- ly mild paranoid phenomenon...\" (Bloecher et al, 1985:10.) Citing Ring & Rosing: \"What the Omega Project unequivocally demonstrates is that in fact not just any- one is likely to report undergoing a UFO encounter...those who do are distinctive in various ways, as our study makes clear...\" (Ring & Rosing, 1990:54.) Citing Rodeghier et al: \"As our results make clear...the abductees we studied are not a random group- ing from the general population. They are distinctive on various factors...\" (Rodeghier et al, 1992:85). CONCLUSION Whilst convinced by the wealth of evidence that the UFO phenomenon is worthy of serious study, and that some cases (e.g., Valensole, Socorro, Trans-en- Provence) indicate a physical component, I remain un- convinced that the Hopkins/Jacobs genetic engineering hypothesis is the definitive answer. If the FPP hypothe- sis fails testing, then we should move on to other testable, falsifiable hypotheses.

UFOs IN THE NEWS GAO CHECKING ROSWELL WASHINGTON — Congress' investigative branch is studying whether the government covered up a story alleging that bodies of alien space voyagers were taken from a crashed flying saucer found near Roswell, N.M., in 1947. After the purported crash of the spacecraft, the bodies of the extraterrestrial visitors were said by conspiracy theorists to have been autopsied and then secretly flown to an Air Force base in Ohio. Even though the \"Roswell Incident\" has been dis- missed by the Defense Department as nothing more than UFO fantasizing triggered by the discovery of a downed weather balloon, the General Accounting Office has begun searching for documents to prove allegations that the. Air Force suppressed information sought by Rep. Steven Schiff, R-N.M. Schiff is a member of the House Government Operations Committee, which oversees the GAO. GAO spokeswoman Laura Kopelson said the of- fice's investigation, first reported in the Albuquerque Journal on Thursday, stemmed from a meeting in October between Schiff and GAO Controller General Charles Bowsher. Schiff complained then that the Defense Department had been \"unresponsive\" to his inquiries about the 1947 incident. Kopelson said \"as far as I know, only one investi- gator had been assigned\" to the case, and that not enough work had been done to report results back to Schiff. At another point, Kopelson said \"the people doing it are either on sick leave or are unavailable.\" Kopelson said Schiff had asked the GAO \"to see if there is any evidence that information regarding UFOs had been suppressed\" after the Roswell inci- dent. The crash of a mysterious object 75 miles north- west of Roswell, which the Air Force later claimed was a weather balloon equipped with a radar-reflect- ing device, was the subject of several books and re- mains many UFO buffs' greatest riddle. UFO buffs contend the incident marked the be- ginning of a government conspiracy to suppress evi- dence of alien life. — Washington Post Service, January 14, 1994 RIGHT TO KNOW MARCH On Sunday, May 1, Operation Right to Know will stage a demonstration demanding an end to UFO se- crecy outside the California offices of Senator Barbara Boxer.

Unless noted, no sound, vibration, or odor was detected. All times are local. • On the night of 30 September, 1992, at 9:18 p.m.. an entire family watched a procession of lights and smoke plumes travel overhead from west to east at Moonville, South Carolina; investigators Mike Harrell and Dee Ewing. The father, mother, and college student son described a main object, large and cylindrical, with a dull orange glow in front and a white-yellow \"propulsion plume\" be- hind, twice the length of the \"body.\" There were five small white points of light travelling with the main ob- ject in formation, one out in front and two on either side of it. These small objects also had tail plumes. During the nearly sixty seconds of observation, a normal meteor was seen to cross the path and pass between the anomaly and the observers. A television news broadcast said that pilots had called the Grecnville/Spartanburg airport re- porting the observation, and an astronomer, Doug Cegan of the Roper Mountain Science Center was interviewed, stating that he had seen the spectacle himself, and be- lieved it to be the re-entry of space debris. Several sim- ilar reports from the same date and time reached MU- FON investigators from witnesses over a wide area, as well as a few reports from that night that do not conform to a booster re-entry or natural bolide observation. Log #930401J. • At Roslyn Estates, Long Island, NY, 26 March 1993, between 7:45 and 8:05 p.m., a 20-year-old woman stepped out to her back yard in time to see a silent disk fly low over her house; investigator. Herbert Taylor. She said that it was at about 150 feet altitude and glided at a fairly liesurely pace off to the east where she could see it in the distance for the next fifteen minutes. The disk had a dark bottom with a group of red lights at one edge, and a group of blue lights at the opposite edge. As it flew away, she was afforded a view that re- vealed a high dome, with \"very bright\" white flashing lights covering the entire top of the object. In her report, she stated: \"Not too soon before I lost sight of the object, I began to notice that small jets (aircraft) were shooting across the sky going in the same direction as the ob- ject.... some in side by side formation. As I stood there and watched the actions of the planes, I began to ques- tion 'What is going on?' I stood there watching the planes flying across the sky in great numbers for about another five minutes ... then shrugged it all off, gave up and went inside the house.\" Log #930402J. • \"/ took a right onto Route 2 when I saw a large, lighted object just above the tree tops hovering over the hill...\"; investigators, Sandy Lepore and Mary McManus. The 34-year-old mother of two of the three children in the automobile drove right underneath the flat-bottom domed disk, visible at the 10:00 p.m. hour by its five brilliant white lights and one red one shining down from its underside. This object maneuvered very slowly around the road and the witnesses, who stopped for three to five minutes to study it, just north of Charlestown, RI, \"when out of nowhere came the second object about 1/3 to 1/4 of the size of the first.\" This one was octagonal in elevation, possibly with a cylindrical circumference, and had five more of the \"blinding\" lights on it. Both objects started drifting to the northwest, so the car was moved to be able to see them among the trees. A third and fourth light appeared, these just star- like points, and the excitement in the car became too much for the youngest, an eight-year-old girl, who \"be- came scared and started crying hysterically.\" By the time the others got her calmed again, the lights were al- most out of sight, so they continued to their house. Calls to police and airports turned up no other wit- nesses. The date was 23 January 1993. Log #930702E. • On 23 March, 1993 a MUFON member and former A PRO Field Investigator looked out through a window and saw a \"brilliant, small, steady orange light\" over Warden's Pond near South Kingston, Rhode Island; in- vestigators Jon Gaboriault and Sandy Lepore. Under a rainy, overcast sky at 7:40 p.m., the witness thought it to be highly unusual and put his binoculars on it, only to see it fade rapidly to darkness. Five minutes later a formation of three twin-engine military planes, blinking white lights, flew low over the same spot and close to the witness' house, followed closely by a heli- copter. A few minutes later, the apparent same three planes, minus the helicopter, flew in from the ocean following the reverse course north over the pond. Was it a military exercise involving a flare?

JANUARY 1994 NUMBER 309 PAGE 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL February 1994 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Venus (magnitude -3.9) begins to appear very low in the SW during evening twilight late in the month. It sets then about 45 minutes after sunset. Saturn (0.9), in Aquarius, is visible early in February very low in the SSW at dusk. On the 1st, when it is only 1.3° S of brighter Mercury, the ringed planet sets about 6:30 PM. Thereafter, it sets earlier and earlier until finally entering the morning sky on the 21st. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars (1.2), in Capricornus, finally becomes visible again with difficulty in late February very low in the E. At that time the ruddy world rises about half an hour before the Sun. Jupiter (-2.2), in Libra, rises in the E about midnight and ad- vances across the southern sky to the SSW at dawn. The giant lies 3° above the quarter Moon on the 3rd. Jupiter com- mences retrograde or westward motion on February 28. SETI Update: NASA's search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) with new equipment ground to a premature halt last fall when fur- ther funding was terminated. Disenchanted with recent NASA failures and with big-science projects, Congress in effect killed the project. During its one year of operation, the radio search for alien signals came up with 15 baffling observations that warranted a second look. However, each one of the sig- nals failed to recur so an ETI origin could not be verified. (Many such odd signals have turned out to come from earthly sources such as satellites or radar transmissions.) Similar alien candidate radio sources appeared during Project META (Planetary Society/Harvard) and SERENDIP (University of California at Berkeley). Eight of META's 11 candidates were concentrated toward the plane of the galaxy, an unlikely lo- cation for earthly radio interference. But in all cases in both projects, the signals never repeated when the antennas were returned to the spots. The nongovernmental SETI surveys are scheduled to continue operation, at the same time ex- panding their frequency channel capacities. Moon Phases: Last quarter—February 3 New moon—February 10 First quarter—February 18 Full moon—February 25 <J c o The Stars: The brightest of all stars, Sirius dazzles the eye due S during the midevenings of February. Its very name seems fitting— from the Greek word for \"scorching.\" Marking the head of Canis Major the Big Dog, Sirius appears so brilliant because it is both the nearest of the bright stars (beyond our Sun), be- ing 8.6 light years distant, and an intrinsically very hot, white, A-type star. At midmonth the Dog Star is low in the SE at dusk, transits S at 9 PM, and sets WSW about 2 AM. UFO in- vestigators should be thoroughly aware of this infamous \"IFO\"! The Big Dog's little companion Canis Minor can be found to the upper left of Sirius and opposite Orion's shoulders. Requiring a huge imagination to visualize, the Little Dog is characterized by only two bright stars, Procyon and fainter Gomeisa. Procyon, 8th brightest star in the heavens (exclud- ing the Sun, of course) and 3rd nearest bright star after Sirius and Alpha Centauri (at 11.4 light years), rises half an hour ear- lier than Sirius. In fact, Procyon's Greek name refers to its rise time; the word means \"before the dog (Canis Major).\" February 19-20 — Tampa, FL, Holiday Inn. \"Do We Have Visitors From the Unknown?\" Call 417-882-6847 or write TRIAD Research Conferences, 4033 S.

Schmidt and David F. Webb. If you have not already voted, please detach the ballot, vote for one candidate, affix your signature and mail promptly. If a family membership exists, each member may vote on the same ballot identifying the person you are voting for and signing your own name. The deadline for re- ceiving ballots at MUFON headquarters in Seguin, Texas has been extended to February 15, 1994. This prestigious position is only one of the four MUFON Board of Directors elected by the membership that they represent. These gentlemen need your support, therefore please vote now if you have not already done so. MUFON-BBS NETWORK John Komar has relinquished the MUFONET-BBS to Pete Theer to fill the role of administrator. His data line is (512) 556-2524 and home telephone number is (512) 556-2746. This network has members in Australia, Canada, South Africa, and the United States. It is a closed network for MUFON members only, however it does have a public access. MUFON CONTINUES TO GROW 4732 copies of the December 1993 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal were mailed to members throughout the world with our Season's Greetings on the cover. Now in our twenty-fifth year, we will be commemorating our silver anniversary symposium in Austin, Texas on July 8, 9 and 10. This is an appropriate time to thank all of our members for making MUFON the world's largest UFO investigative organization. As a grass roots orga- nization, the majority of the credit for this growth must be given to the outstanding leadership of the State and State Section Directors. At least once a year, we do a casual analysis of our membership roster to identify states where growth is prevalent that could be attributed to statewide leader- ship. We are also analyzing states where strong leader- ship is lacking that creates a handicap to UFO investi- gations. Based strictly upon the total members in each state, California leads the pack with 499 members with 269 in southern California and 230 in the northern part. The other states in descending order are Texas (347), Florida (335), New York (237), Michigan (175), Illinois (170), Pennsylvania (137), Massachusetts (129), Ohio (128) and Washington (126) rounding out the top ten. Conversely, the ten states that appear to have poten- tial growth are North Dakota (5), Wyoming (6), Puerto Rico (8), Alaska (9), Vermont (11), Rhode Island (12), Idaho (13), West Virginia (15), Kentucky (18), and Maine (18). On the other hand the top five Provinces in Canada are Ontario (56), British Columbia (31), Quebec (29), Manitoba (11) and Alberta (9). These figures are taken from our computer membership printouts at the end of December, which were mailed to all State/Provincial Directors and their Assistants. It may be used as a guideline to measure future growth during 1994 in each state or province. In the brief analysis above, one would assume that the more highly populated states would have the largest membership, however this is not necessarily true. California with a population of 31,211,000, New York with 18,199,000, Pennsylvania at 12,048,000, Illinois at 11,697,000 and Ohio at 11,091,000 do not rank in the top ten states percentage wise. When the 1993 esti- mated population is compared to the actual members in each state as a percentage, significant leadership efforts do stand out. Surprisingly, some of the smaller populated states have a higher percentage of members than large ones like California and New York. When all of the states are ranked as a percentage, Delaware at .006% is number one, followed by the District of Columbia at (.00415%), South Dakota (.00335%), Florida (.00244%), Washington (.00239%), Maryland (.00231%), Missouri (.00216%), Massachusetts (.00215%), Texas (.00192%), and Vermont (.00191%). Accolades are extended to the State Directors and their teams, ranked in the top ten above. As we enter 1994, the MUFON Board of Directors and the Journal Staff wish each and everyone a pros- perous New Year and continued cooperation in resolving the UFO enigma — the greatest scientific challenge of the space age. NEW BOOK ABDUCTION: Human Encounters with Aliens by John E. Mack, M.D. Will be published by Charles Scribner's on April 20, 1994 (352 pages) ISBN 0-684-19539-9 for $20. Dr. John Mack, the Harvard psychiatrist and Pulitzer Prize-winning author, has dedicated the past three years of his life to treating people who sincerely believe they have had encounters with aliens. Dr. Mack, as a responsible physician and researcher, can- not discount their \"experiences.\" He examines this remarkable phenomenon, and his theory of what it means to human consciousness. He presents 13 case studies which reflect his work with over 100 people of various ages and economic backgrounds, from three-year-olds to major political figures. Most of these people have no history of men- tal illness, alcoholism, or substance abuse. In fact, most of them come to him searching for a rational explana- tion for their encounters, and are devastated when they must accept their experiences as true occur- rences.

Haines, Ph.D. (A review of Multiple UFO Cases). NEW WESTERN MUFON AMATEUR NET Several amateur radio operators in the western region of states have expressed an interest in organizing a MU- FON net to cover Mountain and Pacific time zones. The subject was revitalized during Walt's November 14th participation in the \"Area 2000\" radio talk show on Las Vegas, NV radio KDWN, hosted by Art Bell and sponsored by the Robert Bigelow Foundation. A sev- enty-five meter net was discussed at that time when it was found that Art Bell was also a ham radio operator. Prior to this date David A. Eckhardt (W6LEV) in Albuquerque, NM was invited to organize a forty meter net for the western states. After listening to the 40 meter band for several weekends, David believes that the fre- quency 7.233 MHz each Saturday morning at 0930 MDT (1630Z) would be the most conducive time for the convenience of both time zones and minimum foreign broadcast interference. This is the second announce- ment in the Journal. W6LEV will inaugurate this net on January 8, 1994 at the prescribed time as the Net Control Station on 7.233 MHz single side band. We invite all of our MUFON amateur radio operators to check in to this new net. The feasibility of organizing a 75 meter net is pending. EASTERN REGIONAL DIRECTOR ELECTION The names and qualifications of the three candidates nominated for Eastern Regional Director appear in the December 1993 issue of the Journal (page 20) along with a ballot for the members residing in the eastern states. The very qualified candidates are George A. PAGE 24 NUMBER 309 Continued on Page 23 JANUARY 1994"}]
