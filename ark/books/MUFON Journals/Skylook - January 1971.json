To gzin a fresh and objectihe perspective on the UFO problem, the UFO Subcommittee of the AIAA, from its inception in 1967, decided to ' phce specific, well-d~fined questions to UFO experts of high scicnti- fic qu~lifications but st,rongly divergent views.

It is at this stage where guesses and speculations creep into the discussion end lead to controversy.

It is interesting thzt,, contrsry to public opinion, the estimzted percentage of llhoaxesll is lik,ewise small (less than 5%) 2nd that the great mejority of UFO P-,-:htings c?n be explained by known phenomena (zbout 75%) while 15 tc 20% contain insufficient d2te. In other words- what may appear to the untrzined obscrver as strange 2nd unexplainable is in most czses known znd explsineble, Taking all evidence which h'2s come to the Subcommitt'ee*~' attention into 2ccount) we 'find it diff'icult to ipore the smll residue of well- documented but iinexplainable cnses.which form the h~rd core of the UFO controversy. They represent only a small fraction of the \"unidentifie-. cases and ?re characterized by'both a hiph degree of credibility and a high abnormzlity ( \"str7ngenes~'~ in Hynekf s terminology). Although none of them offers: to our' knowledge quzntitative rec'ordings by cali- brated instruments for permanent inspection, th-ey zre often called \"hard cases. l1 The Subcommittee has tried to explore the nature of this h~rd-core residue and found estimptes to vary between 10 2nd several hundred cases, depending in pFrt on a sub<jective judgment as to the criteria for a \"hard case;\" 'High credibility is generally accepted for observa- I tions by multiple independent witnesses of known and reliable back- , ground or by mult'ilj'le independent sensing systems (reported by multi-ple indeperldent operators) or both; high abnormality or strzngeness, whgn no known natural phenomena whatsoever seem,to fit the observations, It is cle~r, then, th~t the hard' core residue represents less than 1% of the tot21 availz'ble reports. Those used to 8work.ing under controlled laboratory conditions find 1.:. difficult to consider, seriously Pny observation which is not availzble in recorded form for\"quantitative inspection.' As a matter of fact, tl?c:- make this a criterion for' a \"hard case.'' On the other hznd, there arc those,~including~some members of this Subcommittee, qamilisr with the intricicies of resejrch in the 'complex and yncontrolTed 'lrborstory of the atmosphere, .who find this le~s of a deterrent.

SKYLOOK In the opinion of the Subcommittee, this question must be esked critically and ob,je3ctively in each individuel case. lr! cases which do not fit the extrapolation alternative, the. further question should be explored: \"Do tneY evidence common attributes?\" It epnears to the Sub- committee that,-the University of Colorado group has mde no serious attempt in this direction,. ' If it is alreaey difficult. to reach a consensus on what constitutes a h~rd case, it appezrs even more difficult to find ayreement on the advisability and imnortance of ~r~rt,in~:~'d reseerch.

These topics czme to our attention in connection with the interpretation of some UFO reports, but thcv are also of fundamental scientific interest, 2nd they zre relevant to przct- ical problems rckted to the improvement of safety of militzry 2nd civ- ilian flying.\" The Subcommittee finds ;this statdment of the Condon report a bettcr criterion for support of UNC-related -studies than the c1ai.m by some ETH ex~onentk th~t UFO rese2rch deser,ves maximum support es long as thcre is a-ghost of a chance'that UFOs are extraterrestripl veh$c.les, or the opposite claim that proof for the ETH must be provided before serious consideration of;the UFO prcblem is justified. Both opinions strike the Subcommittee as unwarrznted. We have already expressed our disenchantment with arguments ?bout the probability of the extraterrestrial origin of UFOs, since there is not sufficient scientific basis at this timc to take a position one way or the other. However, in view of the infzncy of our sceintific and technologic~l knowledge (approximate1.v one century,) , the ~ubcornr~t - tee would agree with this ststemcnt by Condon: \"We must-not Pssume thzi: we ?re capable of im~gining now the scope and extent off futur~ techno1 ogicel development of our own 'or any other civilization, snd so wt muc:-3 guard ppzinst 2ssuminp thzt-we hsve 2nv c~pacity to imegine wh~t a' more adv~nced socicty would reg2rd as intelligent conduct.\" On the other hand, we find no convincinp basis for his stetement, is s~fe to assume that no ILE (intellipent lire elsewhere) from outside of our, solpr svsf,em hes any possibility of visiting E~rth in the next 10,000 years.\" :(lllhen does one st~rt counting?) The question ariscs whether there is a need rt all tb spsculate on a s~ecifi~c hypothesis, such as ETH, in order to decide on the signif- icznce of a scientific problem, or whether any known phenomenon in qature lis worth i'nvestig~ting.

To illustrate this with a speciflc example, he UP the most publicized physical evidence case known--the Ubatuba magne- sium fragments. These fragments apparently were the only physical evidence analyzed by the Condon Committee. To review--on Sept. 14; 1957, it was reported an observer saw a UFO explode in mid-air, slicl~~ti;.ing fragments over the sea and a beach in thc C -Ubatuba region of ~Br'azil'. Three snldll pieces of dull-grey metal were then mailed to 2 newspaper column~st in Ric de Janiero, and he reported the signature on' the letter was \"lllegible.tt The s2mples werc .turned over to the late Dr. Olavo T, Fontes, a local UFO investiga&or, who took.-them to' a -Brazilian government lzbocatory for analysis. Emission spectroscopy revealed magnesium of ttunusuel pGritytt con- taining \"no other metallic elementtt and \"no trace elements. \" Analysis by x-ray kliffraction affirmed that the samples wcre bout 100% pure magnesium but also reve~led that they cont~ined magnesium oxide and mag- nesium Hydroxide. x-ray diffracti-on 2lso disclosed a type of atomic structure. that lncli-cated the llsamples were fragments of 2 m~gnesium ~asting.'~'A density of 1.866 grams per ccibic centimeter was found in- stead of -the expected vzlue of '1.!741 for- terr~stial: .m2gnesium. Although this could indicate a non-terresti+al\"isotonic' distribution, the s~ljlpl~s were not subjected to mass sp6ctroscopy. The Aerial Phenomena'Rcsearch Organiz~tion then received the samples .(Dr. Fontes was a member' of APRO) and submitted. one ,of the frag- ments to the United 'States hir. Force for analysis. But when the frag- ment ~as~~~accidentally burnedT9 during an at't~mpt 2t emission spectros- copy, APRO declined to send another. Emission spectroscopv by the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) reve~led smell amounts of iron, silicon, aluminum, 'and copper present as impurities in the sample. The AEC also redetermined the ,density of-one of the fragments by another method and found it to be 1.7513--fairly close to the expected value of 1.741. In Februsry of 1968, one of ,the fragments was loanea to the Condon Committee .and it was subsequently'analyzed by neutron gctivation an- alysis at the F.B.I. laborztories in Washington, D. C. 'rhe sample was found to be 99.9%- pure magneslurn. Magncsiun of this purity currently can be produced here on the earth. Small amounts'of zinc, b?rium, manganese, and chromium were found as impurities, but no alummum or calcium. ,Most terrestial-magnesium contains the latter two elements. The Ubhtuba fragments are extremely interjesting, but thcy have not conclusively convinced most scicntists that they are genuinc extra- terre~tr~ial UFOrfrSgmcn-ts.. There's. just too much to detract from this conclusi'on. For example', the idea of a hoax cannot be ruled out be- cause the finder .of the fragments has never been identified. ~lso,' a-lthough the- fragments have been rather extensively aria-lysed, the a- alyses sre confusing because they conflict, Confusion:always leads to' doubtl, Dr. Utke reminds us.

Is. Lorenzen reports on a vsricty of phenomena--psychic happenings, ghosts, sea mysteries, ice fplls, t'creatures,ll'etc.--in addition. to UFOs. Though the book m2y not rneasurc; up to the standzrds which have been set by the previous Lorenzen bookc, , it is a fairly typical collection of t1Forte2na.tt Some minor erros~se8re evident, but nothing of an outstanding n~ture. Many of the accounts involve anonymous witnesses, which is rither disconcerting to some \"reader's who would prefer all the fects regzrding a .particular case. I cannot.vouch for the accuracy of all such accounts, of course, but 1 happen to have full dctzils on one of the ftanonymoustl cases presented (from another source) and no errors are to be found in this instznce. .

A f&w yeers ?go, the British periodical FLYING SAUCER REVIEW, ios- ued a special public2tion entitled THE HUMLNOIDS. It ws virtually the first major attempt to catalogue a portion of the many tfoccupantrt sightinps of the UFO era. A hrrdcover edition (with added rnzterial) was later published in Engl~nd, This same edition hzs recently been publisfied in the U.
