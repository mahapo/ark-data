Schuessler was glven on Agril 24, 1364, In the Cocuulity Koom or' Lile ~Gebster Groves Trust Co., Webster c;1'3v -:s, I;O. S$omored by the Bshatits of Webster Groves, the lecture was z-i-ce&e6 by over 50 people. Thc owsentation began with a cursory look into the reality of what 1s beiq observed in our skies and identified by the three letters-- LFG, Stztctmunts made by &. B. E. Schwartz and published in the Oct- Doer 1963 issue of Medical Times were quoted. Of significance were his observations: a) ?h<.i-L psychopathologic~,l and parapsychological explanations for the VFO phcnoi~ena weye usually l1:,nted to those who are neither psy- chia t~ists nor parzpsychologists , b) In 12 years of privrte psychiatric practice he has not found UPOts or rclated phenomena to be 2mt of any dereistic thinking for patients of his. c) ~e' feels that doctors have n real .responsibility in the areas; of 5POts. Yaticnts often contclct their doctor first because of sleep- lessness, bums, rasnzs, traumas, etc., caused by a UFO encounter. If the d~ctor reacts in a responsible manner he can prevent drawing a; person into a phychosis and inflicting permanent harm. Time was devoted also to nossit;'-,le ex?lnnntions oth?r than psycho- lcgic,,l or psychic tynes : sllch as : hoaxes, bclll lightning, aircraft, etc. Once the meaning of the term li1!'Y>, was established, a brief hkstory of the pheno~ena was disci.~ssed. Beginning wlth Kenneth Arnold, then Vashington Nztional, and fidally a series of reports Bappening on this date--April 24th, including Loilnie Zamora of Socorrot, New Mexico. The stage.was th'en set to describe the necessity of UFO investiga- tions ~xl bjhere to affix the responsibility for such investigations. Naturally, a plug for A.P-R.O. wzs thrown in, as well as for our loczi St, Louis Study group,. The role of Project Bluebook was out- lined n~cl events leading to the sward of a USAP contract to the Uni- versity- of Colorado and Dr, Condon were traced. Becausc of its .volume the Condon Report was only briefly discussed, Those rizilly interqst2d in its cont?nt can, of course, read it in its entirety. The conclusions were coinpared with the mat of the report, noting the co'nflicct between the conclusion and cases 2, 21, 46 etc. Anyone with even a small ano~mt of scientific curiosity would want answx-s to these unknowns and I'm s7ae that open-minded individuals will seek after the truth, regardless of the conclusions set forth bp ddwni-d U. .Condon. -On the 'local scene, tne 1967 3FO incidents at St. Clair and New. , Florcncc, iy!~;, were discdased. \"?l1c A~gust, 1368, Or Fallon UFO incident - was exzmin?d and current 15369 statewide UFO activities presented.
