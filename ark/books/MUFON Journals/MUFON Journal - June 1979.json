FROM THE EDITOR The UFO debate in the British House of Lords, reported in this issue, is a perfect microcosm of the UFO problem—a problem of attitudes, of priorities, and of military/political reactions to questions that have no neat explanatory pigeonholes. Since UFOs do not \"attack\" and wreak widespread destruction, they are,concluded to \"pose no threat to national security.\" The British Parliament and the U.S. Congress daily are faced with urgent problems of energy, population, pollution, and crime. For obvious reasons, UFOs are seen as more ephemeral. They do not obviously affect day-to-day life and must therefore be given a lower priority. The British Lords, whether pro or con on the UFO subject, quite properly look to science for guidance...but do they look in vain? Another famous Britisher, Lord Bertrand Russell, pointed out years ago that science increasingly does \"political\" work, dictated more by where the research funds are available than by any noble \"search for truth,\" particularly where ridicule may be the reward. The Lords are to be commended for some thoughtful commentary, pointing out the very human difficulties of coming to grips with a problem that threatens to outmode many of our cherished ways of governing or of coping with nature and \"reality.\" In this Issue BRITISH PARLIAMENT DEBATES UFOs   3 MUFON SYMPOSIUM AGENDA   11 NEW ZEALAND FILM REPORT - Part 2   12 By Bruce S.

The debate fills about 70 pages of the House of Lords \"Official Report\" of Parliamentary Debates. Since the discussion touches on many important issues, extensive excerpts are reproduced here. Credit Peter Tomikawa ,for providing the official transcript. UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS 7.7 p.m. The Earl of CLANCARTY rose to call attention to the increasing number of sightings and landings on a worldwide scale of unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and to the need for an intragovernmental study of UFOs; and to move for Papers. The noble Earl said: It is with much pleasure that I introduce this debate this evening about unidentified flying objects — known more briefly as UFOs and sometimes as flying saucers. I understand that this is the first time the subject of UFOs has been debated in your Lordships' House, so that this is indeed a unique occasion. Before proceeding further I think I should declare an interest, in that I have written a number of books about UFOs. I am grateful to those noble Lords who are going to follow me in this debate and I am sure that it will be a most stimulating discussion. Before speaking about the need for an intra- governmental study of UFOs, which is the basis of my Motion being debated today, I think it advisable to give your Lordships some • background to this fascinating subject of UFOs. I shall briefly cover a little history, the classes of witnesses, the characterises of UFOs and some important sightings, and then I shall deal with the vital subject of the attitude of governments to these important phenomena. . .: (The Earl of Clancarty described ancient Egyptian reports, World War D sightings, and early 1940's and 1950's cases.-Ed.) There are literally vast numbers of these astounding reports. Indeed, my Lords, this worldwide UFO invasion of every country's air space is of growing importance and therefore I suggest that Parliament keeps a continous watch on the situation. I have thought of one way of doing this. In the same way that there is a House of Lords Defence Study Group ably chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Shinwell, perhaps we could have a House of Lords UFO Study Group to meet periodically. If any of your Lordships are interested, please let me know! I should like to touch on the attitudes of Governments towards this subject and to stress the need'for an intra-governmental study, which is the object of my Motion. I am only going to talk about four Governments, your Lordships will probably be pleased to know. First, let us take a look at the United States. I think that one of the reasons for \"playing down\" UFOs some years ago in the United States was the fear of panic among the public. This was partly based on an actual panic that did occur in 1938 due to a very realistic broadcast by Orson Welles of H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds. Thousands of people left their homes. However, after the war, the United States Air Force investigated pilots' reports without any debunking. Then the Central Intelligence Agency, the CIA, stepped in. The CIA controls the intelligence departments of the United States military services. They ordered the United States Air Force to clamp down on UFO reports. That was, I believe in 1953 and it has been going on ever since. Pilots who reported seeing UFOs were ridiculed, and after a time other pilots did not report them for fear of damaging their reputation. We had high hopes during President Carter's election campaign that there was a strong possibility of a breakthrough to the truth about UFOs. He disclosed during his campaign that he had seen a UFO a few years previously in Georgia, and he added that if he got into the White House he would release to the public all the UFO information in the Pentagon. Unfortunately, that election pledge has not been fulfilled. What has been happening in the Soviet Union? Probably the leading ufologist in that country is Doctor Felix Zigel, Professor of Higher Mathematics and Astronomy at the Moscow Aeronautical Institute. For a long time he had been trying to form a big UFO research group on a worldwide scale. Many UFGs have been seen over the Soviet Union. In July, August, September and October 1967, for instance, giant space ships were seen over various parts of the USSR by astronomers and other witnesses. On 10th November of that year, it was announced that there was to be a full investigation of UFOs. This was announced on Russian television. The operation was to be headed by Major General Anatoly Stolyerov, with Doctor Zigel as Number Two. Thousands of UFO cases were to be analysed by scientists and Soviet Air Force officers. However, the Russian Academy for Sciences came down hard on the new UFO group and on 27th February, 1968, Pravda published the official attitude of the authorities, and the cover-up was on. There is, however, one country which can be relied upon to take a line independent from others over many matters, and UFOs proved to be no exception. In February, 1974, the then French Minister of Defence, M. Robert Galley, was interviewed entirely about UFOs on France Inter radio station. The interviewer was Jean Claude Bourret. At the time there was tremendous publicity in France, but for some reason our newspapers did not even mention the broadcast. M. Galley stated that the UFOs were real but admitted that it was not known where they came from. He said that since 1954, there had been a unit in the French Ministry of Defence collecting UFO reports. Some of this material was sent to the National Centre for Space Studies in Toulouse, the French equivalent of the American NASA. In this Centre there was also a unit — a scientific one — studying both UFO sighting and landing reports. A little over a year ago, I received some information that this particular unit was under government sponsorships and so I put down a Question for Written Answer. The noble Lord, Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge, kindly confirmed to me in his reply that the GEPAN unit — those are the initials of the group — had been set up under the French Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Artisans at the centre in Toulouse. M. Galley also added that the gendarmerie were playing a very important part in UFO investigations, questioning witnesses and examining burnt circular marks on the ground where UFOs had landed, or were alleged to have landed. So the French have been taking it all seriously and keeping their own people informed. Nobody panicked and people did not rush like lemmings into the sea. It is not time that Her Majesty's Goverment informed our people of what they know about UFOs? The UFOs have been coming in increasing numbers for 30 years since the war, and I think it is time our people were told the truth. We have not been invaded from outer space. Most incidents have not been hostile. Indeed it is us, the earthlings, who have fired on them. There may have been a few allegedly hostile incidents, but I maintain that if there is a disturbing element in a phenomenon which is pretty friendly on the whole, we should be told the truth. Whatever the truth is, I am sure that an informed public is a prepared one. Another thing: it is on record that both sighting and landing reports are increasing all the.time. Just suppose the ufonauts decided to make mass landings tomorrow in this country — there could wefl be panic here, because our people have not been prepared. The noble Lord, Lord Strabolgi, is to reply (Continued on next page) ."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"(Parliament, Continued) for Her Majesty's Government at the end of this debate. I should like to ask the noble Lord whether he will contact his right honourable friend the Minister of Defence, about the possibility of giving a broadcast interview about UFOs, as his counterpart across the Channel did in 1974. That would go a long way to discredit the view held by a lot of people in this country that there is a cover-up here and that in some way we are playing along with the United States over this. I should also like to see an intra-governmental study of the UFOs. All Governments should get together and pool their knowledge about UFOs, and the results should be passed on to the public. Finally, I should like to thank your Lordships for your kind attention, and I beg to move for Papers. 7.29 p.m. Lord TREFGARNE: My Lords, I am bound to say that I face making this speech with some trepidation. I had wondered whether we could justify the holding of what is in effect a full debate on this matter; but having seen the audience we have tonight, and indeed having heard the speech of the noble Earl, Lord Clancarty, I can see that that sort of thought would not go down too well. I may well be shouted down before I finish anyway, but let us see if we can avoid that right at the start. The noble Earl asked us in his Motion to support a proposal particularly for an intra- governmental study — I suppose he means, as indeed he has described, between Governments. No doubt he would wish to see the co-operation of the United States. But I should not want to support that kind of proposal. I do not think the time has yet come when we can view this matter, with sufficient certainty to justify the expenditure of public money on it. I certainly agree that the numerous voluntary bodies, including those with which the noble Earl is associated, ought to be encouraged, and indeed I should not be opposed to informal links between those bodies — or, at least the responsible ones— and others, such as the Ministry of Defence. But I am ashamed to say, in the midst of all this faith, that I am not myself a believer in UFOs described, as I believe they are, as objects or vehicles from another planet or from another universe. I have some 2,500 hours as a pilot. I have flown across the atlantic a few times as a pilot. But, unlike with the aircraft reported by the noble Earl, I have never seen one. I presume — indeed, I believe — that a good many of the sightings can be explained by logical scientific theory and I am, so far at least, convinced that those that cannot so far be so explained could be, if our knowledge were more advanced or if. we had more information about the sightings in question. It is these unexplained sightings upon which ufologists rely so heavily in asking us to accept their theories. But 1 believe, as I say, that these unexplained sightings could be — and indeed, would be — explained, if we had more knowledge about them; for example,, better photographs. How many clear photographs of UFOs have your Lordships seen? All I have seen are hazy, fudgy photographs which could, or could not, be genuine. Ufologists often rely upon radar information for evidence in their case, but I must tell your Lordships that radar plays more tricks even than the camera, and 1 do not believe that radar information, in this context, is valid. For example, the recent sightings in New Zealand, which were widely reported just before Christmas, including some rather strange-looking photographs which appeared on television, were also said to have been confirmed by radar information which was available to the aircraft in question. But I know from my own experience that radar is frequently used, and, indeed, is so designed, for detecting anomalies in atmospheric conditions and in weather patterns, and I am not persuaded that radar is a valid supporting argument in this case. Since time immemorial, man has ascribed those phenomena that he could not explain to some supernatural or extraterrestrial agents. Eventually, as scientific' wisdom has advanced, these phenomena are understood more fully, until now, today, no one takes witchcraft seriously and there are no fairies at the bottom of my garden. It is not so long ago that magnetism, as it occurs naturally in the form of lodestone, was thought to be the work of the Devil, as indeed were some of the hot springs found in Iceland, Australia, and elsewhere.... I emphasize that I do not for a moment doubt the sincerity and conviction of those who believe in these objects, who believe that they are visitors from another universe or, at least, some supernatural force beyond our reason. I simply do not happen to agree with them. I certainly do not agree with th learned professor, speaking on the radio the other morning, who said: \"Anyone who believes in UFOs is a loony.\" But as for the suggestion that an international. study group should be set up, I do not think that I could countenance that as a serious proposal at this time. I emphasize, however, that I would be happy to encourage informal links between, for example, the RAF and the very worthy groups who believe differently from the way I do.... The noble Earl, Lord Clancarty, has done us a service by bringing this matter forward, but I would counsel caution and care. 7.38 p.m. The Earl of KIMBERLEY: My Lords, as the noble Lord, Lord Trefgame, has said, the majority of noble Lords in this Chamber will be greatly indebted to the noble Earl, Lord Clancarty, for raising this fascinating and controversial subject this evening. Before I begin, perhaps I should say that I have an interest in it, because I am a director of a company which is to make an identified flying object — a thermo skyship, which is saucer shaped. I shall not get that muddled up. But in spite of sceptics, such as the noble Lord, Lord Wigg, the other day in a newspaper, and Sir Bernard Lovell from Jodrell Bank, who says that UFOs do not exist, we must agree that they do, because otherwise there would be no unidentified flying objects. Furthermore, we should not have throughout the world radio telescopes listening to try to pick up signals from intelligences in outer space.... It has been reported that the United States and the USSR signed a pact in 1971 to swap UFO information, but the pact stated that they were to keep the rest of the world in the dark. I believe that the pact was signed so that neither super- Power would make mistakes about UFOs being atomic missiles. I am also led to understand that quite recently the three United States balloonists who crossed the Atlantic were followed for up to 12 hours by UFOs but were ordered by United States Government agents not to discuss them. We know that war in space, once a figment of the imagination and a subject much beloved by science fiction writers, is very nearly a fact now. Both super-Powers have, or will have, killer satellites and laser beams operating in space. May I ask the noble Lord, Lord Strabolgi, whether he agrees that this may perhaps be one of the reasons for the reticence of the United States over being more forthcoming about their UFO information?. ... As the noble Lord, Lord Trefgame, said, I agree entirely that we do not understand many of these unidentified flying objects because of bur lack of knowledge. UFOs defy worldly logic. Even if one accepts that there may be life elsewhere in our galaxy, or even in other galaxies, the human mind cannot begin to comprehend UFO characteristics: their propulsion, their sudden appearance, their disappearance, their great speeds, their silence, their manoeuvers, their apparent anti-gravity, their changing shapes. They defy our present knowledge and laws of matter. Of course, this naturally upsets our earthly scientists because it is outside their .earthly terms of reference and knowledge, but to try to present UFOs iri a more mundane light let us briefly examine the last 30 years....: (The Earl of Kimberly recounted the early history of UFOs in the United States and presented a list of prominent people who either had sighted UFOs or took them seriously.--Ed.) Despite the United States and the USSR embargo on UFO information, funnily enough the Russians appear more inclined to think that UFOs have extraterrestrial origins. Further, some Russian scientists see a connection between UFOs and paranormal phenomena. In fact, there is an ever-growing belief that space travel has a connection with telepathy and telekinesis, because cosmonauts in orbit have discovered through scientific tests that they have an increased level of telepathic communication. If we assume that extra-terrestrial intelligences who travel to earth are more advanced than we are — and in that respect I think that they must be — then UFOs could be telekinetic phenomena: in other words, controlled by thought pulses. ... I believe that there is much material evidence on UFOs in the national archives in the United States of America which has never been made known to the public, and even President Carter is finding it difficult to carry out his pre-election pledge. I am led to believe that he has tried unsuccessfully with NASA to do UFO research. The answer he has been given is \"No, due to expense.\" That research which NASA has been required to do would cost a few million dollars, but a few million dollars is only the cost of two . astronauts' suits. Therefore it appears obvious that for some reason there is a cover-up in the United States. We in the United Kingdom are in a strange position because we have had thousands of sightings, yet I am led to understand that the Ministry of Defence have only two clerks working (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"(Parliament, Continued) on UFO sightings. Further, they claim that they are not spending any money on UFO research. They appear reluctant to investigate publicly connected.phenomena such as alleged messages from outer space. They say that this is the responsibility of the BBC and the Post Office. Can the Minister say whether the BBC and the Post Office know that they have this responsibility? Further, when the noble Lord, Lord Strabolgi, replies to the debate will he confirm that Her Majesty's Government might be sympathetic and give support to the efforts of President Carter, Dr. Kurt Waldheim and Sir Eric Gairy to get the United Nations to debate the resolution \"to discouer the origin, nature and intent of UFOs.\" The noble Earl, Lord Clancarty, said that we should set up a parliamentary UFO group to met a few times a year. I would concur with him. Further, I think the general public should be encouraged to come forward with evidence. Many do not, for fear of being ridiculed. Let them be open; let them be honest; let them badger their Member of Parliament and the Government to be open with them and to cease what I am convinced is a cover-up here. The people of Britain have a right to know all that the Goverments, not only of this country but others throughout the world, know about UFOs. Before I sit down I ask the noble Lord, Lord Strabolgi, whether he will tell your Lordships why the Ministry of Defence has not informed the public of 18 contacts from 23rd May 1977 up to 22nd February 1978, numbered K 5634 to K 5651 inclusive. Further, what do the classification numbers 5,3,20,16,6,8 and 23 mean for these 18 contacts? Moreover, does the noble Lord realise that 13 out of these 18 contacts were seen during the hours of daylight? There need to be no fear that the people of this country may panic, since if UFOs are extra-terrestrial their intelligence and knowledge is far ahead of our primitive understanding. My Lords, I heartily support the Motion moved by the noble Earl, Lord Clancarty, for an intra-governmental body to research UFOs. Let Her Majesty's Government give an example to the rest of the world by being the leader in this investigation. 7.55 p.m. The Viscount of OXFUIRD: My Lords, first I should like to thank the, noble Earl, Lord Clancerty, for initiating this extremely interesting debate. Of course it is really much above my head, but I have enjoyed it already and I hope I shall enjoy it for the rest of the evening. To me, the first question really is, where have these UFOs come from? There could be a great many answers to that, but in the first place we can look at our own planet and there is no doubt that there is very little chance of their having come from anything in our own solar system. ...  • The next possibility which has been paraded is that they might come from the sister sun in our own galaxy. Of course that is quite possible if you believe in the now accepted — or shall we say more popular —? theory of the \"big bang\" for the start of the universe. Undoubtedly, our sun and its solar system must have been shared with many others at that moment when we suddenly appeared. They even give dates for it now; they talk about 5,000 million years ago, which fits in with our own geological background. There are many stars which have a solar system which might well be in the same position; they might have one planet, as we have, as good as ours and with the same amount of knowledge. On the other hand, we must accept the fact, as the noble Earl, Lord Kimberley, was saying, that it would have to be something which we have not been able to attain on this earth and something that we do not understand on this earth, because if one wanted to get, say, from A Centauri, which is our nearest star, to here, it would take half a lifetime. Even travelling faster than anything we have ever produced in the way of space ships in this world of ours, the distance is 250,000 times the distance that we are from our sun, which is 93 million miles. It is a distance which would certainly take half a lifetime, even at 100,000 miles an hour. So I do not think it would be reasonable to look at another solar system, say A Centauri, which is very near, being only roughly 4% light years from us, which is not very much in space. There is of course the possibility that the UFOs may come from some secret effort on this earth. This I very much doubt because one could not keep a thing like that secret for 20 or 30 years. I very much doubt the possibility of its being on this earth.... If the suggestion of the noble Earl, Lord Clancarty, backed by the noble Earl, Lord Kimberley, is adopted — that is, that we should have a worldwide organisation — to look into this matter and to go further than we have ever done, why should we not be the leaders of it? It would twist science back into a new field. Is it possible that there is not merely another solar system in our galaxy, but that somewhere in one of the many galaxies in the expanding universe there are other places where these things could come from with their amazingly vast scientific knowledge? I personally see no valid reason why we must accept that at this time, but we should start working for it. If we had a worldwide organisation to try to control that, perhaps we should be able to solve many of the problems which face us today in the universe; and nothing could be better. Then we might possibly find the answer to our UFOs. 8.2 p.m. Lord DAVES of LEEK: My Lords, as the one lone figure on this side of the House who has dared to come in on this debate, may I say that it has been a pleasure to listen to the noble Viscount, Lord Oxfuird, who has just spoken and, who has, in his own inimitable way, as a result of his military and other experience over the years, brought a certain depth and profundity to the request for some investigation into the phenomenon with which mankind is presented today. Consequently, with all sincerity I can say that I hope this House will have the pleasure of listening to the noble Viscount on many occasions adding his voice to our deliberations, and I thank him for what he has said. Now I want to attack the problem in my own way. First, I want to ask what are we talking about. Secondly, after expressing my gratitude for the maiden Speech, I would also express thanks to the noble Earl, Lord Clancarty, who initiated this debate to call attention to the increasing number of sightings and landings on a worldwide scale of unidentified flying objects. There is no argument about that. Do not let the noble Earl be a little bit sad because of dandy intellectualism that may approach this debate. The world oozes with intellectuality and at the present moment it is completely lacking in wisdom. Let us remember what I have said rruiny times here, and it was my old mother who taught me this; she made me go to Sunday school and quote the text. She would say in Welsh: \"Always remember, my boy, Solomon did not ask for cleverness, he asked for wisdom.\" There is a vast difference between the dandy intellectualism of some of the reporters on newspapers' approach to this problem and the wise approach that we have just heard in this maiden speech. Let us anchor that down. What else does the noble Earl ask for. He says on a worldwide scale and that there is need for intergovernmental study. I will add to it from the other side of the House that the expense would be so small that we should not neglect this. . . . There is a queerness in the cosmology of the world in which we are now living. Was Wells right? We .certainly see mankind acting queer when petrol is short. He is snarling and worse than any being from outer space. The antropological arrogance of 20th century man in his tinpot motor-cars riding through the streets of the lovely spaceship we call the world is heartbreaking. He has learnt nothing from his two wars; and if we had another, God help mankind, in view of the way that he has shown his greed, selfishness and tendency to panic as never before since the days of the Crusades. The greatest delusion in the history of man was the delusion of the Crusades. But men went on them after the days of Peter the Hermit with a fiery and fierce belief in what they were doing.... The House has heard a number of laudable people quoted. Ordinary little people have sometimes been laughed at, especially those concerned in the famous sighting at Pascagoula in Mississippi when one little fellow fainted when he saw a chap with one leg jumping towards him with a wizened and wrinkled face, with pointed ears, crab claws for hands, slits for eyes and holes beneath his nostrils — they would not be nostrils without holes, at least I should hope so! We shall not develop fantastic descriptions like that. We shall not go into those realms. But we must say that there are many people who have said that they have experienced these phenomena. I agree that the New Zealand incident has reawakened man's interest and as the noble Lord, Lord Trefgame, said, they were not clear picures. However, I attended a scientific lecture in this noble building not so very long ago, given by someone who believed faithfully in the Loch Ness monster. He showed us masses of films. He was a scientist and he swore that the Loch Ness monster existed. There is just as much case for the existence of flying saucers. We know that (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"(Parliament,* Continued) they exist. All we are saying is that they are unidentified. They may be terrestrial or celestial. We are asking Governments to find an answer and that is all that this debate is about. There is no magic, we have nothing up our sleeves, but let the world know what is going on. ... Is the earth the only planet populated by intelligent technological life? I do not know and I do not suppose that we shall be able to find an answer yet. If in a year of Queen Elizabeth I had said to someone in London that I could show him a picture of Philip of Spain in Madrid on a piece of glass in his room, I would probably have been burnt at the stake as a wizard, or as a witch if I were a woman. However, we can do that today. We have broken through. We have the miracle on earth of television, even from the moon. . . . For a couple of generations now thousands of magazines and so on have reported these sightings. We want to know whether these objects that are unidentified deserve real research in depth. Whether or not it is true, only our prejudices can decide, and it becomes more difficult to listen to such weird experiences from apparently honest, sane and unself-seeking men who place their findings before papers and Goverments. Are we right to call these men liars, hallucinators or sensationalists? If one human being out of the tens of thousands who allege to have seen these phenomena is telling the truth, then there is a dire need for us to look into the matter. Those who believe in psychic phenomena or spiritualism and those who believe in the synchronicity of ghosts — as they try to explain them — should not scoff at the possibility of these unidentified objects. We know that poltergeists exist; we know about their activities. Therefore, we do not be so ready to scoff at UFOs when, in another moment if I catch you talking, you will agree with me that poltergeists exist. This is a serious Debate. It deserves study and understanding. 8.30 p.m. The Lord Bishop of NORWICH: My Lords, I count it a privilege to follow the noble Viscount, Lord Oxfuird, and to link myself with the words of the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Leek, in' congratulating the noble Viscount on his maiden speech. At the beginning of his speech I jotted down that I should like to thank him for his \"down- to-earth remarks,\" but when he got right out to A Centauri I realised that that phrase was of no use anyway. However, we congratulate him and look forward to hearing his voice again and often. . . . It is right that we should give a cool and scientific look at all unidentified flying objects, not only because of natural curiosity, not even only — as I think the noble Earl, Lord Kimberley, suggested — because of national security but also for reasons of scientific research. There was a time when leaders in the Church were not always so enthusiastic about pushing out the frontiers of knowledge as I believe we are today. I very much hope that such a search will continue. Whether or not it should be an infra-governmental study I am not sure. We shall listen with interest to what the noble Lord, Lord Strabolgi, says to us on that. But that it should be studied, and seriously studied, I believe to be true. ... I think that we should be quite cool, firm and scientific and try to extend our knowledge in this area. But, with the wealth of scientific, aeronautical and erudite knowledge in your Lordships' House, what is a bishop doing moving among the various parts of this chequered chessboard? I felt that I wanted to share anxieties on a rather narrow level with your Lordships. First, I believe that UFOs and the mystery . surrounding them today are helping to build up a climate of credulity and, in certain cases, even of superstition, with the danger of a sort of ersatz spiritually almost reacting against the impersonality of modem civilisation, but not wholly involved in the total Christian commitment, which is a balanced commitment... My concern here today is that the mystery surrounding UFOs today — and I think it is helped by the variety of films and programmes on the subject — is in danger of producing a 20th •century superstition in our modern and scientific days which is not unlike the superstition of past years. That is my first anxiety. . . . I see a certain danger of the linking of religion with the UFO situation at that level. Some Christian researchers suggest that those who .become deeply involved in the religious aspects of the UFO situation come under a psychic domination which can cause serious distress to them and to their personal life. That is my anxiety. I may be wrong, but I put forward with some care, having thought about it and studied it a good deal. Therefore, my third anxiety — and I am sorry to be negative but it is important to share both the light and the dark sides — is the danger of the religious aspect of the UFO situation leading to the obscuring of basic Christian truths. . . . I say this in this debate recognising the danger of, as it were, preaching a sermon. However, I do not think that is true in this case because the very subject we are debating is helping to widen our horizons — and the noble Viscount, Lord Oxfuird, stressed this point of looking far but in his maiden speech. I believe that Christ has not only a terrestial, not only a cosmic • significance but literally a galactic significance. I believe that He is God's vice-regent concerning His great creative world. It is good that our minds and eyes should be stretched further out because I do not believe that at any point of the universe we get beyond the hand of God. Therefore, it helps us to understand the majesty of the Godhead when we begin to stretch our minds to reach out to the far corners of creation. . . . 8.36 p.m. Lord GLADWYN: My Lords, I must begin with an apology. Before I knew that the debate was to start so late I entered into an obligation for this evening from which I find it difficult to escape. Therefore, I may be unable to stay the course. One happy thing about UFOs- is that they have nothing whatever to do with Party politics! Another is that they take one's mind off the absolutely frightful everyday events. Besides that, no theory as regards them can possibly be laughed out of court, nor need angels in respect of them fear to tread! I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Leek, would agree. Though many alleged sightings are of identifiable objects of terrestrial origin, such as disintegrating satellites, balloons or meteors, or even some sort of reflection, others are of things which, on the face of it, cannot be accounted for in this way. The evidence of this is obviously too circumstantial to be disregarded. The evidence produced by the noble Earl, Lord Clancarty, and my noble friend Lord Kimberley, is obviously too circumstantial. You cannot disregard that. These things almost certainly do exist. It is difficult to say that they do not exist. Therefore, unlike the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, I do .not contest their existence. Some objects may be of terrestrial origin, but equally some may not. Whatever their origin, it has certainly not as yet been proved that they contain, or are controlled by, sentient beings of any sort. Still less has it been demonstrated that such sentient beings come from another planet, of which we are told there are many millions in the universe and no doubt many thousands on which conditions may well be similar to those on earth. It is conceivable, therefore, that UFOs come from another world; but that, to say the least, is not certain or, let us say, is not yet certain. Let us therefore for a moment examine the terrestrial and the non-terrestrial hypotheses. If these objects are terrestrial, they come somewhere from our world, then they may conceivably be attributable to some condition of the atmosphere, or upper atmosphere, unknown to us, producing electrical or similar phenomena which no doubt interfere with compasses and for some reason dart about the sky, sometimes even coming to earth. The difficulty about such an explanation is that they never seem to come into actual contact with aircraft, or any other airborne objects. Even if collisions have sometimes been suspected, they have not been proved to have occurred. Nor, apparently, do they ever crash into anything important on the ground. When they are alleged to have been seen on the ground it is always, incidentally, away from houses. I suppose it is conceivable that they may be capable of passing right through physical objects, their mindless trajectory being therefore harmless, and 'dictated by some unknown physical cause, and their apparent presence on the ground being due to some local conditions on the surface. All I say is that this is a conceivable hypothesis. In any case, the fact that their occasional presence is so far inexplicable does not in itself invalidate the terrestrial hypothesis. There are, as the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Leek, said, more things in Heaven than are dreamt of in our philosophy. . . . If these objects are not terrestrial, then admittedly, always supposing they exist and are not mere illusions, they must be of some non- terrestrial origin. We can, I think, discard the possibility that they come from any of the other planets, as was said by the noble Viscount, Lord Oxfuird, whose maiden speech we so much appreciated; I hope we shall hear from him again shortly. Venus is too hot, Mars is a lifeless wilderness, and conditions on the others are extremely unlikely to be compatible with any form of life. Thus, from whence do they come? They can only come from a planet in some other starry system, of which the nearest, as the noble (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"(Parliament, Continued) Viscount said, is the star Proxima Centauri, which is 4% light years away. Always supposing, therefore, that UFOs are manned by sentient beings who travel at the speed of light — and if you travel at 186,000 miles a second, how do you slow down on approaching the earth? (how wonderful to imagine!) — these creatures must have been cooped up in their small machines for no less than 4-5 terrestrial years before appearing in our atmosphere. One can perhaps imagine that they may somehow have been able to escape from time and consequently not need any sustenance or sleep, but it is difficult, even on that hypothesis, to believe their machines are somehow time-exempt and can consequently contain enough propellent to keep them steady on their millennary way. . . . There may be more sightings now simply because we have better facilities for observing them. If so, what conclusion must we draw as regards the whole non-terrestrial hypothesis? It is simply that these sentient and obviously highly intelligent beings from another planet, if such they be, at the end of an interminable journey, are content simply to hover about our atmosphere and not attempt a landing, or at least a landing of which we have any uncontrovertible evidence. What could be the point of such strange proceedings? These sentient and obviously intelligent beings must have picked up enough information to conclude that a serious landing was feasible or, if not feasible, then to abandon the whole idea. Perhaps they may even in some mysterious way have been able to master our language and penetrate our thoughts. I think it was my noble friend Lord Kimberley who said that conceivably they were .under some sort of thought control from a planet in the neighbourhood of Proxima Centauri. If that is so and it is simply a question of thought control, then it comes down apparently to a sort of cosmic joke being played by these sentient beings from 4% light years away on the unfortunate inhabitants of this globe; they are a sort of hallucination in that they induce us by thought control to believe in them. It is a conceivable theory but I do not think it is a tenable one.... The more over-populated our planet becomes, the greater the violence and the more appalling the wars, the more, unconsciously perhaps, we want to leave it if we can or trust in other worldly intervention; and the more intense therefore the longing, the greater the temptation to believe that there actually is somewhere else to which we can physically go or to which we can somehow make an appeal. It was a great disappointment when the moon was discovered to be a mass of grey plasticine, that Mars was even more unpleasant than the middle of the Sahara and that Venus was the nearest thing to Hey. What is the moral? I agree with the right reverend Prelate, who said so eloquently—we are indebted to him for his intervention—that perhaps the moral is that we had better not put our trust in saucers for salvation but, rather, concentrate on how best to conduct ourselves here below so as to live in charity with our neighbours and eventually die in peace. If the UFOs contain sentient beings, we can only leave 4 it to such being to get in touch with us when, and if, they will. Up to now, if they exist, they have done no harm of any kind. Apparently they have done no harm for the last two or three thousand years. So there seems to be no great need to set up intra-governmental machinery to investigate the whole phenomena. The mystery may suitably remain a mystery, and so far as I can see no body will be in any way the worse off if it does. 8:50 p.m. Lord KINGS NORTON: My Lords, I should like to add my thanks to those which the noble Earl, Lord Clancarty, has already received for opening the debate in such an extremely interesting way. I found my imagination boggling a little at some of the things he told us. Nevertheless, I feel that it is of immense value that this matter has been brought out into the open by the debate in the House, and I hope that as a result of it there will be some progress in the understanding of what is an extremely serious matter. I feel that we must be careful about our terminology in discussing the UFO problem, and I believe that I shall make clear in the course of my remarks what I mean by that. For example, in the past few days, since it was known to my friends that I was to take part in the debate, I have had over and over again the question: Do you believe in UFOs? I must say that I think that is rather a silly question, because if I saw something in the sky which neither I, nor whoever happened to be with me, could identify—I have not, but let us suppose that I did—then I should have seen an unidentified flying object, a UFO. I do not have to believe in it. I should believe merely that I had seen it—something that I could not explain; and I believe that many people are in that position.... I am sure that many—and perhaps most—of the sightings recorded and reported are terrestrial in origin: aeroplanes with navigation lights glowing at night; satellite launching rockets burning up on re-entry; remotely piloted vehicles, now beginning to be called RPVs; up on trial flights; weather balloons; trick reflections of light. In the extra-terrestrial class I am afraid that I cannot think of anything other than meteorites, Northern Lights and ball lightning, but there are probably other well known physical phenomena within the knowledge of astronomers and meteorologists. I feel, however, that some of the reports we have had—and we can for the time being leave out Ezekiel—are not readily explained in terms of 1 any of the possibilities which I have mentioned. The New Zealand phenomena are worth much more investigation than they have yet had, but so far, in so far as I have been able to understnad what has been reported, they do not appear to be explicable in terms of any of the suggestions which I have so far made. That seems to go for the quite extraordinary,widespread sightings recently in Italy, where hundreds of people as reasonable as you and I, my Lords, seem to have seen quite inexplicable things in the sky. It would be worthwhile trying to explain them, and if there are- people who know what they are, they ought to tell us. The high probability in my mind is that they are terrestrial in origin, and the only extra- terrestrial possibilities do not seem to be feasible because of the very eccentric paths which the objects, or lights, which were seen seem to have taken. But if they are terrestrial phenomena, we ought to be able to identify them. I believe that any dispassionate investigation, such as I understand the noble Earl, Lord Clancarty, would wish to have, could not ignore the possibility of the phenomena having their origins outside the earth and perhaps outside the solar system. Just as meteorites are chance material projectiles originating in the solar system, may there not be random matter of a different character—perhaps a luminous but insubstantial character— that in certain circumstances becomes visible and attracted to our area? I certainly should be readier to accept some explanation in terms of what I might call the atsronomical phenomena than ships from outer space. It would, I suppose, be foolish to deny that possibility, but as an explanation of phenomena— and I think that the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, exposed this—it is surely a very long shot indeed. If we are to conduct any dispassionate inquiry—and I think that we should—we must listen to the proponents of what one might call the Sfar Trek view. It can be argued, not unreasonably, that we in our humble way are probing nearby solar space with our Venus and Jupiter and other vehicular probes. We have ventured on to the Moon. Is it not presumptuous, the argument goes, to suppose that elsewhere in space creatures more advanced than us are probing into our space, probing with means now occasionally visible to us, using their own RPVs, controlled from stations light years away, rather on the lines which the noble Earl, Lord Kimberley. mentioned? It is a possibility which we must be prepared to consider. It is a possibility, though not many of us, I feel, would call it a probability.... The desirability of getting rational and acceptable explanations for the odd phenomena which are being reported—even if, like some other para- normal phenomena, they are subjective—in my opinion is not, or should not be, merely to satisfy our curiosity.... There is a social danger, in my view, in leaving people in ignorance of the origins of these phenomena. I have recently learned from a number of sources that there have grown up, in North America particularly, many groups and cults whose attitudes are based on beliefs that UFOs are influential outer-spatial manifestations interested in this earth. In some cases these groups are looking to outer space for Man's salvation. If this is right, it is rather disturbing. I find, too, that in this country there are groups interested, other than purely scientifically, in the UFO phenomena. I had a letter—and I think that other noble Lords may have had the same letter—earlier this week from an ecumenical Christian group which believes, among other things, that UFOs menace the spiritual health of the nation; that they are anti- Christian and that information exists about them which is being withheld. It seems to me that this association of UFOs with mysticism and religion makes explanation of the true origins of the phenomena a matter of great importance and of some urgency. The sooner that each reported sighting or landing is satisfactorily explained, the better. It is no good just laughing them off or trying to laugh them off; we must seek the truth (continued on next page) 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"(Parliament, Continued) and tell it. My Lords, I remain sceptical, perhaps more sceptical than anyone who has spoken this evening except the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne. I remain sceptical of the more bizarre extra- terrestrial explanations. 1 remain more than sceptical, indeed, incredulous, of what the noble Earl in his Motion called \"landings\"; but I support him wholeheartedly in his wish for a serious inquiry. I hope that the Government will take steps to put such an inquiry in hand. Finally, I come back to the matter of terminology. In his Motion, the noble Earl called for \"an intra- governmental study.\" The noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, and, I think, the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, took this to be an inter-governmental study. But \"intra\" means \"within.\" I was puzzled by the use of the prefix, but that is what it means and presumably what the noble Earl meant. But why a study within the Government? I would support the idea of a Government-supported open investigation by a carefully chosen group of scientists and technologists with some funds at their disposal; but a study within Government would seem to smack of a secret probe, which would be no good at all. 1 have no objection to a House of Lords study group, but they could scarcely perform in the way that a public organisation supported, say, by the learned societies and the engineering institutions, could perform. It is something of that kind that I should like to see brought into being under Government or with Government support: a group of dispassionate people with the power, the money and staff on a modest scale to investigate. Perhaps in his reply later this evening the noble Lord, Lord Strabolgi, will comment on the suggestion. 9.4 p.m. Lord RANKEILLOUR: My Lords, first, I must thank the noble Earl, Lord Clancarty, for this debate, the subject of which has long needed an airing; and, although the noble Viscount, Lord Oxfuird, is not in his seat, nevertheless I congratulate him on his speech. The UFO saga is deep and complex and there are no known experts to keep us up to date with everything to do with it including its mechanics. However, scientists throughout the world have been drawn into an ever-increasing discussion as to what UFOs are and where they come from, so far with little enough results except to wonder why the bounds of natural physics seem to be broken on all sides,,,Most Western Governments say that UFOs do not exist, but I think that the French Minister of Defence, M.Robert Galley, in February, 1974, said that they do; that his Government takes them seriously and that they have been studied secretly by a special department for over 20 years. Indeed, France leads the world in UFO research. It has followed up sightings with police teams, scientists and scholars and, since 1950, the Deuxieme Bureau of the Army.... Is it not curious that we of the 20th century, with a vast knowledge of science behind us, should be blind to further wonders in the skies above? Men throughout the world have been branded as mad or mistaken when they have 8 reported having seen strange sights in the heavens. Many men have seen these sights and have not been mistaken. Who are we to doubt their word? Who are Governments that dare to ridicule the honest? Not long ago the Loch Ness monster was regarded as a fable, but now our leading naturalist says that it (or they, possibly) probably exists. Why, then, should unidentified flying objects be any harder to believe, especially as they have been seen far more frequently? My Lords, of course they exist. Only a few weeks ago a Palermo policeman photographed one, and four Italian Navy officers aboard a light patrol boat in the Adriatic, in the early hours of the morning, saw a 300-yard long fiery craft rising from the sea and disappearing into the sky. Odd, strange, frightening, but apparently quite true. Indeed, why should these men of law enforcement and defence lie? Of course, they did not lie. Why . should they; especially as in this case their sighting was backed up by men from a nearby radar station who saw it, too. Each year there are many sightings of UFOs throughout the world. Some of them are very close at hand, while others are not, but always the effect upon those who see them is one of concern; and yet this very point is ignored and ridiculed by most Governments right around the globe. In the United Kingdom's case, those who report seeing UFOs are taken to be misinformed, misguided and rather below par in intelligence. If this is so, why has some of my information on this subject been given to me by the Ministry of Technology? Why should this Ministry waste its time gathering false information? Of course, it is not. false information: it is data reported by civil and Air Force pilots, policemen, sailors and members of the general public who have all had personal experience which has intrigued and/or frightened them.... The noble Lord, Lord Strabolgi, who is to wind up this debate, is no doubt sympathetic to the reasons for these speeches, for it has become patently obvious to a great many people that this subject had got to the point when Governmental explanations must be forthcoming. A greater measure of open government is long overdue, and bringing the UFO saga into the realm of respectability would be one way of achieving this, in part. I suspect that the British Government do have a Department studying UFO sightings, for why else should they bother to go to such trouble to publicly debunk reported ones if they are of no interest to them? Quite apart from the fact that the Government have not admitted to the existence of UFOs, these machines are potentially dangerous. They give off blinding light, crippling rays and sometimes beams that immobilise humans; they start forest fires, eradicate crops and cause great distress to animals. If the British pouplation was aware of this, they could sometimes take precautions. UFOs have been with us for many generations, so is it not about time that we officially recognised their existence and treated reports as less of a hot potato than hitherto?... 9.14 p.m. Lord GAINFORD: ...My main contribution to this debate is to assure the noble Earl, Lord Clancarty, of any support that I can give. If we are going to have a study group in your Lordships' House I shall be glad to be a volunteer to take part whenever I have the opportunity. I also thank him and others for initiating this debate, and for the pleasure of having such a refreshing subject to discuss in the midst of the present period of crises and strikes.... If I had the time and opportunity, I should enjoy volunteering for working in a UFO information center, if that might be a suggested name for the organisation that would be required. I shall be interested to hear the summings up in this debate. I can give no explanation why there should be these phenomena concentrated within particularly the past 32 years as was confirmed by the noble Earl, Lord Clancarty, and these flying saucers in the year 1947 when the phrase was coined; but I would just accentuate what has been said before and add that if they are man-made or some astronomical feature, and provided there is no risk of any security breach, then the public have a right to know about them. 9.20 p.m. The Earl of HALSBURY: My Lords, in common with everyone else who has spoken, I should like to thank the noble Earl, Lord Clancarty, for giving us an opportunity to have, as it were, a scamper over the course and exchange views on this very interesting and controversial topic....: (The Earl of Halsbury recounted several instances of personal 1 sightings of \"angels,\" zeppelins, sundogs, and \"green flashes.\"-Ed.) Lastly, I come to ball lightning. I have never seen ball lightning, but the description one reads of it is so coherent, so similar in all cases, that one must accept it as a phenomenon which occurs regularly in nature, though we cannot reproduce it in nature and attempts to reproduce it in the laboratory are, to my mind, unconvincing. There is no theory of it. It appears to take the form of a football-shaped mass,of glowing gas which hops around or, if it has a chance, gets on to a conductor such as the rail in the gallery here and migrates along the conductor until it finally disappears with a bang. It has never been satisfactorily photographed, to my knowledge. If it has been, then the photograph must be a fairly recent one, and, as I say, it has not been reproduced. But this, again, should assure .the noble Earl, Lord Kimberley, that, faced with an unknown phenomenon which I cannot explain, I do not get vertigo. I should be delighted to go ball lightning watching, as I go bird watching.... Lord HEWLETT: My Lords, I join other noble Lords in congratulating the noble Viscount, Lord Oxfuird, upon his maiden speech but I run the terrible risk of being accused by the noble Lord, Lord .Davies of Leek, of being an anthropological arrogant specimen. I am not quite sure what that means, and I am not quite sure that he knows what it means.... I am only sorry to appear to be a veritable Daniel in a lions' den of UFO believers and to spoil the fun, and I have no doubt that today's flights of—dare I say it?—fancy will command far more attention than our debate yesterday upon British industry, which scarcely made today's Press at all. More's the pity. Of course, there is a danger in terminology and in gross assumptions. Many (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"(Parliament, Continued) noble Lords have spoken as though UFOs were actually something, but of course we are precisely saying that if they are unidentified flying objects, we do not know what they are. So I quite agree, let us dismiss 1 the concept of flying saucer equals UFO to start with. Let us try to take a slightly more scientific approach. I would not dream of speaking in this debate had I not asked my very good friend and neighbour in the Cheshire village of Swettenham, Sir Bernard Lovell, Fellow of the Royal Society and Nuff ield Professor of Radio Astronomy, to be good enough to brief me at Manchester University Department of Radio Astronomy at Jodrell Bank, of which he is the Director. I went there two days ago and what I am about to say to your Lordships is based entirely upon that round table meeting with Sir Bernard and the members of his senior staff at Jodrell Bank: Of all the thousands of reports of sightings that have been made, whenever it has been possible to make an investigation they have been found to be natural phenomena, or in some instances, I regret to say, pure myth. Over the United Kingdom, Jodrell Bank's radio telescope, the first and still one of the most powerful in the world, has observed thousands of possible subjects for identification . as UFOs, but not a single one has proved other than natural phenomena. I would ask the noble Earl, Lord Kimberley, to take the point on board. If UFOs, as he suggested, defy human knowledge, how do we really know by what possible means or possible background they even exist at all?...: (Lord Hewlett pointed out the large number of rockets and associated hardware in space, meteorite falls, and an association of Venus with UFO sightings.--Ed.) One of the most advanced experimental stations at Jodrell Bank—just take these statistics on board please, my Lords— has been on watch 24 hours a day for 30 years. Do you not think it reasonable for me to suggest that if there were UFOs at least one claim would have been made, but every single thing that has been seen and observed by radio astronomy has been identified as natural phenomena and as occurring from the universe itself as we know it—I do not say from the solar system; I say from our universe. If there were something in it—and the noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, is so right—of course the scientists would have been delighted to come forward with an announcement to that effect. After all, it was Jodrell Bank that managed to locate the Sputnik when the Russians, who so cleverly launched it, lost track of it in the atmosphere. So do not think that this is some denigrating comment by the scientific lobby and some nasty, cheap debunking exercise. No my Lords. We must take a serious scientific view of the actual surveys and of what has been discovered....: (LordDaviesof Leekand the Earl of Kimberly interjected to dispute the contention that nothing remained unidentified, and the latter to suggest Jodrell Bank might be part of a cover-up.-Ed.) I think that it would be most unwise of any defence establishment to make a categorical denial of UFOs, and equally foolish of me to do so. I am not trying to prove the existence of nothing or that something does not exist. I am saying that in the scientific evidence so far—and I can deal only in detail with the United Kingdom—there is no evidence whatever from the greatest radio telescope of a single UFO. I think that the attitudes of defence establishments world-wide, even including the Soviet Union, are probably wise; they must display the antithesis of over- confidence and complacency, lest there should perchance be some new arm of warfare that they have not adequately explored or even entered. But there is no direct connection between the possibility of other persons occupying other bodies, either within or outside our own solar system. However, one thing is quite clear: there is an infinitesimal chance that there exists other people who could be within our time-frame—and I refer of course to the statements made by the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, and the noble Earl, Lord Halsbury—who would be able to spend perhaps ten or hundreds of light years getting here and who would have survived that length of time in those atrocious conditions and entered our earth atmosphere assuming that they are some sort of humanity and have some form of flying saucer, or whatever our friends proclaim it it. How could they possibly meet us in those circumstances? Let us take the million-to-one possibility that they could. Do your Lordships mean to tell me that they could get so close to us as to be sighted, but be incapable of any form of communication or identification whatever? No, I am sorry.... I am sorry, the existence of UFOs is even more fanciful than Gilbert and Sullivan's lolanthe—charming indeed, but I am afraid a joke upon your Lordships' House. I am afraid that some of my noble friends join the flat-earthers, who will make the best playmates for this particular lobby. We have a duty to the country to explode the myth. Tonight we have been carried away in realms of fascination and delight, but they have precious little to do with the facts. I suggest that the myth must be exploded. We must return to work in this dreary old world and the difficulties we are in. But I beg your Lordships, and in particular the noble Lord, Lord Strabolgi, for heavens' sake, no more Government Departments of inquiries. That alone we should be spared as the result of this excellent debate. 9.55 p.m. The Earl of CORK and ORRERY: My Lords, I hope that the noble Earl, Lord Clancarty, will not be cast down by the speech to which he has just listened. I myself must confess that I know remarkably little about unidentified fly ing objects. I know a few things about them. 1 know quite a bit, and I have learned more since the beginning of this debate, about attitudes towards them. They are almost as interesting in sortie ways. There is one type of attitude towards them that I view with respect, and that is the attitude represented by people who call themselves, or perhaps to be fair are called by others, \"ufologists.\" I do not know whether the noble Earl will accept that word. I rather hope he would not. I admit the charm, the satisfaction, and the neatness of UFO as—this is the word the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Leek, is so good at—an acronym, coming from \"unidentified flying object.\" But it unfortunately leads to a word which to disrespectful persons, and there are some about, might be suspected as originating somewhere between illiteracy and the purely silly; rather as though a keen student of the affairs of the United Nations should describe himself as a \"Unologist,\" and his interest \"Unology.\" That would have been severly distressing to my late lamented friend Lord Conesford, and indeed to me.... I must make a remark—nobody has done so so far, I suspect rather to his surprise—about the speech of my noble friend Lord Trefgarne. If he had been speaking as a private Back Bencher I would probably have not said anything, but he was speaking from the Dispatch Box. Therefore, he presumably represents the views of the Party to which I belong. It is a view 1 wish to disown entirely, because if a Party of any magnitude cannot produce better views than that on a serious subject, I confess I am ashamed of it. If this represents all that the Conservative Party can produce in the way of thinking on what is undoubtedly a serious subject, whatever your opinion about it may be, then this is deplorable. If the noble Lord really thinks that there is no serious interest or belief taken nowadays in witchcraft, perhaps he does not read the right newspapers, but 1 can assure him that this is far from true. He is not a believer in unidentified flying objects. \"I am no believer in UFOs,\" he said. I do not know how you can not believe in UFOs. You can take it for granted, if your mind takes a leap ahead, that by an unidentified flying object something is intended that is supposed to have originated in outer space, and you can-say you do not believe in that. But I do not know what it implies 10 say that you do not believe in an unidentified flying object. You do not believe in its object? You do not believe in its flying? You do not believe it is unidentified? There are things that are unidentified. Perhaps we are not trying. I do not think it is reasonable to say that they do not exist. Nobody, except my noble friend Lord Hewlett, has seriously contended that they do not exist. The question is, what are they?... (In response to an interjection by Lord Trefgarne): I am anxious not to misquote him, but he also said that ufologists—it is difficult not to use that word—referred to unexplained sightings which would be explained if only we had better evidence; that was the gist of one part of my noble friend's argument. In other words, if we had better evidence we should be able to explain those sightings. That is the sole point on which the noble Earl initiated this debate. That is what he is asking for; he wishes evidence to be collected, collated, examined, evaluated and reported on as to what these things are, and it is notable that he himself did not say what he thought they were. Other noble Lords have spoken as though he had said they were fairies or I do not know what, when in fact he said no such thing. I believe he is a leading authority on these matters—certainly he has studied them more closely than anyone else of whom I have heard—and he must have exercised very great restraint in this matter, and he is to be congratulated on that as well as on initiating the whole debate.... The noble Earl has done a service by displaying before our very eyes the scientist- philosopher who knows precisely the limits of (continued on page"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"(Parliament, Continued) science and makes no effort to go beyond them. Nor does he point the finger of scorn at anyone else. He must know, as others know, that it is impossible to prove anything by negative evidence. If you wish to prove that something is not so you can do it only in logic—by proving the existence of something that is so that makes that first premise impossible. Thus, you cannot prove that any particular type of flying object does not exist, and with respect to my noble friend, the fact that the Jodrell Bank telescope has not seen something not only does not prove, but is not even particularly good evidence, that it was not there. I am prepared to accept, if told, that the Jodrell Bank telescope has been operating on a frequency suited to the observation of UFOs of one kind or another for the last 30 years, but, until I am told that, I shall be sceptical in that matter. Lord HEWLETT: Let me be quite clear about this, my Lords. I did not say other than that Jodrell Bank had made many thousands of sightings but had been able adequately to explain them away as natural phenomena from our own universe. The Earl of CORK and ORRERY: I thought that I had my noble friend right, my Lords; in other words, the telescope has not seen anything that was inexplicable. But I do not think that that is really an argument that something does not exist. The question is: what kind of thing can it be? I hope that my noble friend does not think that I am going on about him—I no longer am. How is it possible to maintain more than a certain degree of doubt in 1979?... I have no wish to express any view on what a UFO may be. What I wish to say is that there is no knowing what it is not. It may be a product of some kind of sign language, as the noble Earl, Lord Kimberley, mentioned. It may be mechanical. It may be purely terrestrial. I doubt if it is angels. But I believe that, for the clearing up of mystery, for the removal of doubt, for even the eliminating of some of the dangers which may exist and to which the right reverend Prelate referred, some kind of an open inquiry ought to be set up. I am rather inclined to agree with the noble Lord—I think that it was the noble Lord, Lord Kings Norton—who said that probably it should not be an intra-governmental inquiry. I think it should be something rather more open than that, but it ought to take place. If a group is set up within this House, as suggested by the noble Earl himself, that would be excellent. I should myself be entirely in favour of it. In any case, let us get this matter cleared up and into the open, and by all means let us take it seriously, because this is a serious subject. Far too many people are taking it seriously for it not to be a serious subject.... I have not yet said anything complimentary about the noble Earl who initiated the debate. I have left this to the end on purpose because I think it may not be entirely realised what a service he has done. This is the first such debate that has occurred in any society such as this particular one; and this society, but which I mean this noble House of Parliament, is probably the only legislative assembly in the world in which it could happen. I hope that it will have repercussions which will spread far beyond this Chamber. What the outcome will be I do not know, but, in initiating 10 the ripples which I hope will spread all over the surface of the mill-pond, the noble Earl has done a most valuable service. -I ';. 10.10p.m. Lord STRABOLGI: My Lords, I should like to join with the noble Earl, Lord Cork and Orrery, in saying how grateful we are to the noble Earl, Lord Clancarty, for initiating this debate on UFOs. Of course, the subject has been of considerable interest in this country, and I hope our discussions, which, as the noble Earl rightly said, have been the first that we have had in your Lordships' House, will help to increase public understanding.... There are undoubtedly many strange phenomena in the skies, and it can be readily accepted that most UFO reports are made by calm and responsible people. However, there are generally straightforward explanations to account for the phenomena, as I think was said by the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, speaking for the Opposition—and I must say that I welcomed his constructive speech. There is. nothing to convince the Government that there has ever been a single visit by an alien space craft, let alone the numbers of visits which the noble Earl, Lord Clancarty, claims are increasing all the time. As has been said today, we live in a huge universe. I find as awe-inspiring as Pascal did the contemplation of infinite space. There are some 100,000 million stars in our galaxy alone, which it would take 100,000 years to cross at the speed of light. Beyond our own galaxy, the distances become even more daunting.... The evidence suggests that there is no intelligent life on the other planets of our own solar system, as the noble Viscount said. There are, of course, different views about whether there might be life elsewhere in the universe, but certainly there is no serious positive evidence to show that there is. If there were an advanced civilisation elsewhere in the universe, as my noble friend Lord Davies of Leek supposed, with the technology to traverse these colossal distances, there are many questions to be answered. What is the point of this alleged huge number of visits to our planet, over three decades or more, to no apparent purpose? There seem to be internal inconsistencies in the idea. To put it simply, if these alleged aliens prefer to keep out of the way, the number of reported sightings would surely be only a tiny portion of the actual UFO movements, which would run into many millions. If they do not prefer to pass unnoticed, we could surely expect unmistakeable appearances. Why have they never tried to communicate with us? Why has there been no evidence on radio of attempts at communication? And would not such a large number of movements be picked up by our defence radar system? Why has not a single artefact been found? Assuming that each visit does not represent a journey from a distant star, where are these alien space craft supposed to be hiding? Now that the idea of such bases on the moon or on another planet in our solar system is barely tenable, ufologists have had to claim that the aliens are based in the depths of the sea or in a great hole in the earth, or even that they come from invisible universes and other space-time continua. Anyone who accepts the hypothesis of large numbers of alien visitations seems forced towards explanations that are ever more fantastic, and incapable of either proof or disproof. As I have said, there really are many remarkable things to see in the sky; and most UFO reports relate to actual phenomena reported by sensible people....: (Lord Strabolgi reiterated the many natural phenomena that could be reported as UFOs, citing two recent examples that he said could be explained that way.-Ed.) • All these phenomena can be misinterpreted by the most sensible observers, particularly when seen unexpectedly and briefly and in unusual atmospheric conditions. This is what opponents of the natural explanations forget. With distortions of light, and mirages, the most commonplace things can be so changed as to be barely recognisable. For instance, I am told that the US. Air Force attributed the 1947 sighting by Arnold described by the noble Earl, Lord Clancarty, to a mirage effect.... My Lords, in 1968, the United States Air Force commissioned the University of Colorado to carry out an independent study into UFO phenomena. Their report, which was published in 1969, was very substantial and detailed and it covered some 50 examples of such phenomena, but added that it was impossible and potentially misleading to try to. tabulate all of the possible causes of UFO perception: there are simply too many. The report's main conclusion was, and I quote: \"Nothing has come from the study of UFOs in the past 21 years that has added to scientific knowledge.\" The findings of this report were endorsed by a panel of the National Academy of Sciences. There really are tens of thousands of strange things to be seen. It is the custom to call such phenomena \"UFOs,\" and to transpose this easily into \"alien space craft.\" Often the appearance is too fleeting and the description too imprecise for a particular cause to be attributed. What we can say is that there is a great variety of plain explanations. There is no need, I suggest, for the far-fetched hypothesis of alien space craft.... The recent sightings in New Zealand referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Kings Norton, attracted worldwide publicity, and we understand that the New Zealand Government may make an announcement when the facts have been assembled and appraised. Preliminary advice from our High Commission in New Zealand shows confident expectation that the sightings will prove to be due to natural phenomena, as I think the noble Lord,.Lord Trefgarne, and the noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, implied. My Lords, the noble Earl who initiated this debate referred to the attitude of other Governments to UFOs. It is not for me to speak in this House for other Governments. I have however already made mention of the United States study in 1968 and I understand that nothing has happened since that time to cause the United States authorities to change their views or to warrant further official investigations of UFOs. (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"(Parliament, Continued) The noble Earl also referred to an interview which the then French Minister of Defence, M. Rpbert Galley gave in 1974 on the subject of UFOs. The noble Earl suggested that M. Galley had said that UFOs were real but that he, the Minister, did not know where they came from. I have read the transcript of M. Galley's broadcast and I also took the trouble to check it in the original French. The essence of what the Minister said was that the phenomena were genuine and were reported by responsible people, but that there were aspects that were difficult to explain. Nowhere did the Minister say that UFOs were real in the sense that they represent alien spacecraft, as suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Rankeillour.... It has been suggested in this debate that our Government are involved in an alleged conspiracy of silence. I can assure your Lordships that the Government are not engaged in any such conspiracy. In view of what the noble Lord, Lord Gainford, said, I must emphasise that the Ministry of Defence examines any UFO reports received to establish whether they reveal anything of defence interest, but nothing in the reports examined has ever given cause to believe that they represent alien spacecraft. There is nothing to have a conspiracy of silence about. What is more, a visitor from outer space would be one of the great events in history. It would certainly be an event of stupendous importance, but I hesitate to say the greatest event of all in the presence of my old friend the right reverend prelate the Bishop of Norwich, whose moving speech we listened to with much interest. As the noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, said, scientists are rightly inquisitive people. If there was anything in the stories of UFOs, we would expect the scientific community as a whole to be devoting much effort to studying or to making contact with the supposed aliens; but the idea of a conspiracy of silence by this and other Governments belongs, I suggest, to the world of James Bond. Then the noble Earl, Lord Kimberley, implied that there was some kind of cover-up. There is no cover-up and no security bah. It is true that when people ask to see the Ministry of Defence UFO files they are told that the papers must remain confidential, but there is a very mundane reason for that. The files contain voluminous correspondence from people, and we cannot divulge the identity of the correspondents. It follows that the files must remain closed under the rules laid down in the Public Record Acts, passed by Parliament, which at present preclude disclosure until 30 years have elapsed since the date i of the particular correspondence. The earliest reports the Ministry of Defence hold are dated 1962.... Then it has been suggested, too, in this debate that Her Majesty's Government should set up a study group. I am glad to say that the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, and the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, both speaking from the Front Benches for the Opposition Parties, did riot support this proposal, and certainly Her Majesty's Government do not consider that there is any justification for the expenditure of public money on such a study....

SEGUIN,TX 78155 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"NEW ZEALAND FILM REPORT - II ;   By Bruce Maccabee (Part 1, in the previous issue, described Dr. Maccabee's trip to Australia and New Zealand to investigate the movie film and radar-visual case of last December. Part 2 describes the case event by event and plots each occurrence on maps.--Editor) EVENT DESCRIPTIONS AND MAP LEGEND Times are in local Daylight Savings Time and are accurate to within one minute. Distances are in nautical miles (6076 ft. or 1.852 km). At the cruising altitude the plane travelled at an air speed of about 3.6 miles/minute. During the trip south the people aboard the plane were Captain William Startup (S), First Officer Robert Guard (G), cameraman David Crocket (DC), sound recordist Ngaire Crockett (NC) and reporter Quentin Fogarty (F). The Wellington Air Traffic Controller was Geoffrey Causer (GC). For part of the time the radar technician, Bryan Chalmers (BC), was also present. GC used a radar scope which presented an MTI (moving target indicator) processed radar picture; BC operated a non-MTI display for part of the time. The plane (P) is treated as an \"entity\" when communicating with Wellington radar (W). Christchurch is noted as CH. During the trip north NC was replaced by a Christchurch reporter, Dennis Grant (DG). The event listing is to be used with the especially marked maps (Figures 1 and 2). TRIP SOUTH Event Number Description 1 about 2354 (11:54 P.M.), Dec. 30, 1978: the : plane has taken off and circled to head south and was at this time passing over Wellington. 2 about 0010 (10 min. after midnight), Dec. 31, 1978 (all succeeding times are on this date): the plane was passing or had passed Cape Campbell. F,DC, and NC were in the loading bay working on a \"standup\" for the news story on the previous UFO sightings when S and G first spotted lights in the direction of Kaikoura. The plane had passed 10,000 feet in altitude and was travelling at about 170 knots air speed (the ground speed might have been about 180 knots since there was a slight wind). 3 about 0012: the plane (P) contacted Wellington (W) and asked \"Do you have any targets in the direction of the Kaikoura 12 peninsula on your radar at about that range?\" (approximately correct; the radio communications from the plane are difficult to understand). W replied \"There are targets in your one o'clock (1:00) position (i.e., about 20- 40° to the right of straight ahead) at, uh, 13 miles... appearing and disappearing At the present moment they're not showing....but were showing about a minute ago.\" GC had been noticing \"weird\" targets east of the Clarence River area and the Kaikoura Coast for as long as half an hour before the plane reported anything. S and G reported seeing lights that would appear and then disappear in an apparently random manner, which is consistent with the appearance and disappearance of targets on the W radar. By this time the plane was at 14,000 ft. and travelling at 215 knots air speed (3.58 miles/min.) 4 about 0015: W reported a target in the 3:00 position on the coastline. This may have been seen, but no mention of it was made on the W tape. By this time F, DC, and NC had joined S and G on the flight deck. 5 about 0016: W reported a target at 12:00 at 10 miles which was probably only seen for one sweep of the scope (12 sec. per sweep). This may have been seen by the passengers since they reported seeing lights that occasionally appeared ahead of them. . 6 about 0016:30: W reported a strong target at 11:00 at 3 miles from the plane which apparently appeared for one sweep. P responded with \"no contact yet.\" 7 about 0017:30: W reported a target just left of 9:00 at 2 miles (the spacing between the edges of the radar blips; the actual spacing of target could have been more like 4 miles, assuming that they were at the same height; W had no way of knowing what heights the targets were at.) There was no visual confirmation. 8 about 0019: W reported a strong target at 10:00 at 12 miles. This may have been seen, but there is no specific confirmation. 9 about 0022: W reported a target at the left of the plane at about 1 mile (between blip edges) which remained stationary while the plane did a left hand orbit to see if the passengers could see anything. About this time F, who had been watching the lights, recorded his first \"on-the- spot\" commentary: \"It's kind of hard to describe my feelings right at the moment, but, uh, we've seen probably 6 or 7 or even more bright lights over Kaikoura. A number of these have been picked up by Wellington radar.\" The plane did an orbit (hexagon on the map) which lasted about 2 minutes. Nothing to the left of the plane was seen. Before the orbit started there were lights (other than city lights) in the direction of Kaikoura. 10 about 0024: just after the orbit was completed ' W reported a target at 12:00 at 3 miles. The plane responded 'Thank you....we pick it up. It's got a flashing light.\" F recorded, as the plane came out of the orbit, \"At the moment there is no activity. When we first made the run (i.e., started the orbit) the lights were so bright they appeared to be lighting up the sky . of the town (Kaikoura) Now we have a couple right in front of us! Very, very bright.\" These lights flashed on and off. F recorded \"We have a firm convert here at this moment.\" One of these lights may have been filmed. DC obtained about 12 seconds of footage showing sort of oval, blue-white images which were quite bright (considerable film exposure of stationary, focused images). DC also obtained about 5 seconds of film showing several lights at once in a horizontal row that randomly(?) flashed on and off. He also obtained film of the town of Kaikoura, but the town lights appear to have been much less intense. 11 about 0028: P passed the \"turning point\" at Kaikoura East. W reported that the only targets were 12-15 miles behind them. At this point the plane switched to the Christchurch (CH) air traffic control on another radio frequency. 12 about 0029: W called CH by telephone and said that there was a target about l.mile (between blip edges; blips would have been about 1 mile \"thick\" in a radial direction out from Wellington at the distance of the plane) behind the plane. CH said it would inform the plane and have the plane switch back to the W frequency. 13 0029:30: P contacted W and was told that the target was not at 6:00 at 4 miles. Apparently the target had remained stationary behind the plane for 6 or 7 sweeps of the radar (72-84 seconds). F recorded: \"We've just heard from Wellington radar that we got an object about a mile behind us and it's following us.\" Actually (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"(New Zealand, Continued) W did not. say the target was following the plane. 14 about 0030: W contacted Pand said there was a \"further\" target at 3:00 at 4 miles. GC did not specify whether or not the previous target behind the plane was still there. This new target appeared for two or three sweeps. F recorded \"There's a whole formation of unidentified flying objects behind us.\" 15 about 0030:45: W contacted P and said \"There's a strong target right in formation with you now Could be left or right. Your target has doubled in size.\" The previous target at 3:00 at 4 miles had disappeared, so this may have moved closer to the plane. The distance from W to the plane was now about 90 miles, so on the radar scope the airplane \"blip\" would have been a small arc about 3 miles \"long\" from left to right and about 1 mile \"thick\" from front to back (the blip size is always much larger than the target would be n the scale of the radar scope) because of the 2.1° azimuthal resolution (angular resolution is a horizontal plane) and the better than 1% radial resolution (accuracy of measuring distance from Wellington). Because of the blip size the unusual target could have been as much as 3 miles from the plane (farther than 3 miles if it was not at the same altitude). BC was in the control room at this time and witnessed the unusually large blip on the scope. 16 about 0031:30: W contacted the plane and stated that the target had \"reduced to normal size.\" The plane blip had been unusually large for at least three sweeps (36 seconds) and perhaps for as long as 45 sec. or so. GC and BC agreed that the large blip was like two aircraft flying side-by-side at the same speed the whole arc-shaped blip moved down the radar scope as a unit. There was no bending of the blip as might be expected if one portion (i.e., the unusual target) were stationary while the other portion (plane) moved by it. The plane would have moved about 2 miles during this time, a distance which would have exceeded the differential radial resolution of the scope (i.e., exceeded the minimum difference in distance between two targets that could be measured on the scope). Shortly after this occurrence BC went to another radar scope and turned off the MTI processing. He then saw the normal amount of land and sea clutter within 20 to 30 miles from Wellington, but he saw no indications of anomalous propagation. Also, the \"weird\" targets which had appeared on the MTI display did not appear on the \"uncancelled\" display, suggesting that the anomalous targets were actually weak reflectors of the 50 cm wavelength radar. About this time the co-pilot spotted a flashing light that was apparently travelling along at the right of the aircraft. S turned off the wingtip running light (steady green) to make sure that there was no problem with unusual reflections. 17 about 0032:30: P contacted W and stated: \"Got a target at, 3:00 just behind us.\" W responded: \"Yes, and going around now at 4:00 at 4 miles.\" F recorded \"I'm looking over towards the right of the aircraft and we have an object confirmed by Wellington radar. It's been following us for quite a while. It's about 4 miles away and it looks like a very faint star but then it emits a very bright white and green light.\" Unfortunately this object was too far to the right and behind the plane for the cameraman to be able to get a picture (he would have had to sit in the co-pilot's seat).-- Shortly after this W contacted CH. CH had nothing on radar, but W referred to a target at 5:00 to the plane at 10 miles, which could have been the previous target if it had remained stationary as the plane moved along. 18 about 0035: W contacted P and asked if they had seen the previous target at 4:00 at 4 miles. P responded \"We think we saw that one. It came up at 4:00....around 4 miles away.\" (The distance estimate was based on what W radar had told the plane; the people on the plane had no way of measuring distances behind them.) W then continued \"Roger. That target is still stationary. It's now 6:00 to you at about 15 miles and its been joined by two other targets.\" F referred to this as follows, \"...that other target that has been following us has now been joined by two others, so we now at this stage have three unidentified flying objects just off our right wing, and one of them has been following us now for probably about 10 minutes.\" Actually the time was more like 7 to 7'/ 2 minutes and the targets were stationary behind the plane. F did not have airplane - earphones on, so he couldn't hear the communications from the W or CH radar controllers. His information came from S, G, or DC, all of whom had on earphones and who yelled information to F over the noise of the airplane. About this time F also reported the CH radar has picked up something \"67 or 68 miles north of the city.\" That distance would have been about 6 or 7 miles behind the plane, no more than 7 miles from the location the W gave for the three unusual targets, assuming that CH really said \"northeast of the city\" and not due north of the city, as F recorded. 19 about 0036:30: W contacted P and said that the three targets behind the plane had been replaced by a single one that produced a blip larger than the blip from the aircraft. At this point S decided to do another orbit to see what was behind him. F recorded \"We've just heard from Wellington radar that there's a strong target straight behind us so we're turning....\" The plane was cleared by W for a left hand two minute orbit, but again nothing was seen. 20 about 0101: the plane landed at CH. It was a \"straight-in\" landing since there was negligible wind. F recorded a statement that CH radar had said there were six UFOs headed for the aircraft just before it landed, but no one else remembers such a statement and no lights were seen heading for the aircraft. However, G and S do remember the CH controller referring to a target at the right of the aircraft that seemed to pace the aircraft in toward the landing. G looked out the right window and saw at a lower altitude a flashing light moving along. He at first attributed it to a car headlight that was passing behind trees along a road that ran along the shoreline. Then he realized that the flashing was too regular. He jlso observed ih;it the li'jht apparently crossed a river at the speed of the aircraft. However, he was too busy with this co pilot duties during landing to watch the object closely. S remembers saying to the CH controller that perhaps the object was cleared to land in the grass at the side of the runway. After the plane landed S and G talked to the CH controller while the airplane was being unloaded. G remembers being told about a target which was at the right of the aircraft until just before landing, when it curved and travelled inland. He also remembers being told that someone at the control tower (close- in radar controller?) had looked out a window and seen a light heading inland at about the same time as when the plane landed. The CH controller attributed the anomalous target to a \"side-lobe\" problem, which might have been a satisfactory solution if the \"side lobe\" had disappeared at the same time that the plane landed, rather than travelling inland. In an interview about 6 weeks later the CH controller would neither confirm nor deny picking up a target, but whatever he might have Seen was unimpressive to him. Unfortunately the CH control tower tape was erased and reused, according to a standard 30 day retention rule, before it was copied (in spite of a specific request by S that the tape be retained until he could copy it) so any information that was recorded on the tape is no longer available. TRIP NORTH 21 about 0216: P took off from CH toward the northeast along the \"Moto\" track toward Kaikoura East. The heading is 033 magnetic or 054° true (i.e., 54° clockwise from true north). DG had replaced NC. The climb rate was somewhat greater than 1000 ft/min, a number which decreased as the altitude increased, and the air speed was about 155 knots, a number which increased with altitude. There was a southwest wind of about 15 knots which added to the air speed of the aircraft. 22 about 0218:40: the plane had travelled about 7 miles from CH and was not yet over the ocean. It was at an altitude of about 2800 ft, and was just breaking through a low cloud cover that was over the land. S,D, and DC, who were in the cockpit, observed a bright light through the cloud tops. The light was about 10-30° to the right of the airplane heading. The light was apparently about at the height of the plane. S's first impression was that he was looking at the full moon without seeing any features. (The moon had set in the west many hours before). G described it as a (continued on next page) 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"(New Zealand, Continued) \"squashed orange.\" S turned on the airplane radar and placed it in the \"mapping mode.\" About the time that the light was first seen DG and F, who had been sitting in seats in the loading bay during takeoff, arrived on the flight deck and G pointed out the light to them. This was at about 2:18 a.m. according to a note written down by DG. DG described the light (not necessarily his first impression) as looking like a ping-pong ball (white) that was in a dark room and illuminated by a spotlight. DG also recalled a light below the object which he attributed to a reflection on the ocean. (It might have been a reflection on clouds.) DC had filmed the takeoff from CH so he was ready to film and probably was filming at the time the F and DG arrived on the flight deck. F was now operating the recorder. H recorded: \"We are now about 3 minutes out of Christchurch airport and on our starboard side we can see two very bright lights one much brighter than the other. The only way to describe it it's like a very, very bright star and just below it is another light not quite so bright.\" 23 about 0221:30: the plane radar warmed up and S switched from the 50 to the 20 mile range. He picked up a target about 30° to the right of straight ahead just inside the 20 mile range • ring. By this time DG had moved so that he was standing behind S on the left of the plane where he could see the radar scope. DG repeatedly compared the direction of the bright object with the azimuth (angular direction) of the target on the scope and assured himself that both directions were the same. S and G were also sure that the radar target was in the same direction as the visual target. S and G estimated that the size of the radar blip was 3 to 5 times that of a blip from a large fishing boat. The altitude of the plane at this time was about 6000 feet and it was about 15 miles out of CH. About this time F recorded \"...those two lights appear to be travelling with us the brighter light is still up above the other and has moved a little further ahead now it's just dimmed! It's gone! ...Back again. It appears to be going behind a cloud. I can't quite make out whether in fact it is going behind a cloud or whether in fact the light is just dimming it's lighting up the clouds around us \" DC filmed a light which did fade in and out. DG described the object as if it were a light connected to a dimmer switch so the brightness could increase and decrease continuously rather than going off and on abruptly as when a light is switched off and on. Since the target was about 18-20 miles away from the pane at about 30\" to the right, and since the plane was about 15 miles from CH, the target was 32-35 miles from CH. Since the CH radar had a \"cone of silence\" that extends upward from ground level as the distance from the airfield increases at a rate of 100 feet/mile, an object below 3000 feet, at 30 miles would not (normally) be seen. A weak target for 50 cm radar might not be detected 14 even at altitudes somewhat greater than 3000 ft. at 30 miles. Since the object was not detected by CH radar it was probably at an altitude of around 3000 ft. or lower. Since the airplane radar was operated in the mapping mode the 3 cm airplane radar beam could have picked up a target at a lower altitude. Sometime during the time interval from 0222-0225 DG scribbled a note \"close as 10 miles; 170 knots; pace aircraft.\" At about 0225-0225:30 the target went off radar because the azimuth angle to the target had increased from 30° to beyond about 50°, which was the maximum angle that the scope would display. Before it went off the scope it may have come as close as 8-10 miles, according to S, who had the best view of the scope. G remembers it being at least as close as 12 miles. F recorded \"We must now be about 30 miles out of Christchurch and that bright light is still with us. According to Captain Bill Startup it came as close as 10 miles us us....\" 24 about 0227: P contacted W and said that the plane was 32 miles out of CH at an altitude of 11,500 feet and that there was a \"great big target sitting at, uh, 3:00 to us at about 12 miles.\" P then asked W if W had anything on radar. However, W had not been expected to be called and was not looking at a range great enough to see the plane. W did say that there were many targets off Clarence and Kaikoura. The plane was climbing at a rate of about 800 ft/min at this time and travelling at about 200 knots ground speed. 25 about 0229: the plane reached the cruising altitude of about 13,000 ft. and an air speed of 215 knots. S and G decided to turn to the right toward the object to see what would happen. S made a turn that lasted about 45 seconds. He hadn't expected to have to turn very far, suggesting that the object was not directly to the right of the aircraft, but was still somewhat ahead. However, he found that he had to keep turning and he finally stopped when he had turned about 90 to the right. Before the turn started F recorded \"The pilot has just told us he is going to actually level off and head toward the object to see what happens.\" During the turn F recorded the apparent motions of the object, not realizing that the turning of the plane made it look as if the object were moving up and then down and then to the front of the aircraft. After the turn was completed the sighting line to the object was ahead and downward. DG wrote a note \"2:30 a.m., directly ahead, no radar reading.\". The fact that it was not seen on the radar scope even though it was ahead of the airplane suggests that the sighting line to the object must have been considerably lower than 15° below horizontal, which is the nominal lower bound of the radar beam in the mapping mode. (The pilot did not try to increase the tilt of the radar beam.) If the sighting line had been at an angle of 20° below horizontal and the object had been at an altitude of 3000 ft. while the plane was at 13,000 ft. the distance to the object would have been about 5 miles. G had the impression that the plane had \"overflown\" the object as far as the radar beam detection was concerned. During the time that the plane was on its southeast course the sighting line to the object moved around to the right again. When the sighting line was so far downward and to the right that S couldn't see the object he decided to turn to the left to regain his original track. Before he turned he could see a glow in the right hand windows and the other passengers could see the object. S and G remember flying for \"no more than\" 4-5 minutes on the southeast heading before turning back. Actually they must have flown only about 1- 1.5 minutes on that heading. About the time of the turn to the right, DC stopped filming and went downstairs into the loading bay to get his bigger lens (he had been using the 100 mm. and now he got the 240 mm lens). It took several minutes for him . to install the lens on the camera, but he was ready to film probably just before the plane turned to the left. 26 about 0231: S could no longer see the object so he turned left onto a heading of 066 magnetic (087 true) for a short time and then he continued the left turn to head back to the \"MOTO\" track. F apparently mentioned the start of the turn saying \"It's now dropping away right below us....\" (He was not aware that the captain had decided to turn. Since he was looking out the right window, when the plane banked to the left it would appear to him that the object dropped downward.) Fogarty continued \"It appears, in fact, to be gaining speed rising, coming back up towards us again It appears to be coming straight for us It's getting a little bit brighter.\" A few seconds later F said \"It's now dropping right away behind us.\" Probably during this turn DC obtained film footage with his 240 mm lens. This footage shows an image which starts off large, then shrinks to small bright images, and then grows large and dim. He described the large image to F: \"It now appears to be an oval shaped object with rings of light going around.\" A previous description given by DC before the plane turned to the right was that it had a \"brightly lit bottom and a sort of transparent top.\" The large image was apparently an out-of-focus version of the smaller image. During the time that the 240 mm lens was in focus DC did obtain images that are consistent with his description of the object as seen earlier through the 100 mm. lens. These focused images are sort of bell shaped with bright bottoms and less bright tops. The angular sizes of the focused images obtained with the 240 mm lens are about the same as the sizes of the images obtained earlier with the 100 mm lens, suggesting that the object did not actually get closer to the plane at least during the time that DC was filming. However, it apparently did get quite close to the plane (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"(New Zealand, Continued) after DC filmed it. DC could not film when the sighting line was too far below horizontal because the top of the film magazine would have bumped overhead switches. Therefore he was not able to film it during the time that it apparently passed under the airplane. During the left turn S was surprised to see the object, which had been on the right side of the aircraft, suddenly appear at the front left and apparently above the aircraft. (The appearance of being above may have been due to the tilt of the aircraft during the left turn.) The object then appeared to move downward and pass behind and beneath the aircraft. F last saw it out the far right window while looking almost straight down on it. 27 about 0233: the plane regained the MOTO track at some point north of \"MOTO,\" which is 40 miles out of CH. There is a \"slight\" time problem here in that the W and CH controllers were discussing the position of the plane at 0229:30-0230 and in their discussion they implied that the plane was already heading for or about to reach the MOTO track, perhaps close to the point MOTO. The estimate listed previously that the plane turned to the right at 0229 is based on the requirement that the plane reach its altitude of 13,000 ft. and upon the statement made by P to W at 0227 that the plane was at 11,500 ft. The estimate that the plane turned left at 0231 is based on the minimum length of time taken by F's recorded comments during and after the turn to the right. The estimate that the plane reached the MOTO track at 0233 is based on the travel time of the plane to go along a track as indicated on the map from #36 to#27. These times and the estimated path of the airplane, as well as the estimated path of the object, are all subject to revision. 28 about 0241: W reported to P that there was a target at 20 miles at 10:00, just off the coast 6 miles north of Kaikoura. The location of the object for #28 on' the map does not agree exactly with the location reported by W, but it is close. There 'was no visual sighting, but S may have seen it on the plane radar. 29 about 0245: W told P that the same target was at 16 miles at about 9:30 to the plane. There was still no sighting. 30 about 0246: the plane \"turned the corner\" at Kaikoura East and headed toward Cape Campbell, which they estimated they would reach at 0300. W read the Blenheim weather report. Then, at about 0246.30, W told the plane that -the same target just north of. Kaikoura was at 9:00. The plane did not indicate that the target was seen. 31 about 0247: W reported two targets at 11:00 at 15 miles. P responded \"We don't seem to be picking them up quite so easily on the leg (of the trip).\" 32 about 0248:30: W reported a target at 9:00 at 8 miles. P did not indicate that anything was seen. At about 0250 F recorded the following statement: \"We've now just passed Kaikoura and, uh, there's been no further activity. There are pinpoints of light in the sky, but nothing's been confirmed on Wellington radar. I, for one, am hoping that, uh, we've seen enough, and, uh, the rest of our journey back to Blenheim will be uneventful: I've had quite enough of UFOs for one night.\" Apparently S had the same feeling. He said that he had detected objects on the airplane radar which appeared to him to be in the positions reported by W, but he didn't tell anyone and, in fact, paid very little attention to the radar screen throughout the rest of the trip. He did tell several people after the trip was over, however, that he had had targets on his radar. i 33 about 0251: P asked W if there was a target in the 12:00 position. W responded \" a strong target at 12:00 to you at 20 miles 2 miles off the coast, 10 miles south of Cape Campbell.\" P responded \"We have that one also (?) and quite a good visual display at the moment it looks like a collection of lights \" F recorded \"About 30 seconds after that last statement....we've got another one right in front of us very bright seems to be a long way away. Another one just to the left of it. That one flashed extremely brightly. They've both now faded The other one's flashing again. It's giving off .an orange flashing light. It looks like an aircraft beacon.\" (Note: this comparison is intended to convey the visual impression of very brief and bright flashes as opposed to \"pulsations\" in which the light grows and dims slowly enough so that the brightness change appears continuous rather than abrupt.) F continued \"It's moving off. It's extremely bright. It fades and its dropped. It seems to have just dropped at an incredible speed and it seems to be rolling and turning....in fact....one light has another beside it.\" .The \"rolling and turning\" was described by F as movement around a sort'of elliptical path with the long axis of the ellipse in the vertical direction. The object travelled downward in the elliptical motion faster than it rose upwards, in the opinion of F. DC obtained about 7 feet of film that show a light source that changes in a regular cyclic manner from bright white to dim red and orange for about 32 cycles at a rate of 1.1 cycles/sec. The bright source also apparently moved up and down in a flattened elliptical path much higher than it was wide. This up and down motion was periodic, at least for the first portion, of the film, at a rate of about 2.5 cycles/sec. After describing the flashing light that dropped, rolled, and turned, F described a \"whole cluster\" of lights including one that \"keeps flashing\" and was part of a \"distinc- tive\" pattern of lights. This one may have been the Blenheim airfield beacon. After describing the \"collection of lights\" to W, P asked W if the Blenheim beacon could be turned off so that the passengers on the plane could be sure that they weren't mistaking it for a 'flashing UFO.' The Blenheim beacon flashed red every 1.5 sec. or so. (Note: At this time the beacon would have been about 45 miles from the airplane and perhaps under the V e cloud cover over Blenheim. The cloud cover was at 4000 ft.) The beacon was turned off and at about the same time the bright flashing light disappeared. 34 about 0252: W called the plane to report \"..two targets, one at 9:00 at 8 miles and one at 10:00 at 10 miles.\" Within a few seconds W also reported \"the one south of Cape Campbell has now gone off radar.\" The disappearance of the target from the radar scope was approximately (or exactly?) coincident with the visual disappearance and with the turning off of the Blenheim beacon. However, the radar would not have lost a target just because the Blenheim beacon was turned off. Whether or not the Blenheim beacon was in fact seen was not established. Other bright lights did appear within seconds after the flashing one disappeared. However, they may not have been to the left of the plane as were the W radar targets which \"replaced\" the \"strong target\" that had been south of Cape Campbell. ' F recorded \"Well, we can't be right all the time, but it in fact appears that the last flashing light we saw was in fact a beacon at Blenheim and the pilots asked for the beacon to be turned off. But at the same time that they turned the beacon off, Wellington radar told us that we had targets coming from the left of us. But as I speak now, we have another one, above Blenheim, and that's not a beacon because it's not in the same position as the lights were before, and these sightings at the moment -are right in the position where Wellington radar said they should be!\" Actually, W radar had referred to targets to the left of where the strong target had been, and F referred to a light that was to the right of and higher than the one that had disappeared. DG described these lights as \"pulsing\" on and off as if they were incandescent bulbs operated with dimmer switches so the brightness could change continuously rather than abruptly. 35 about 0253: W told P about 4 targets at 9:00, 9:30, 10:00 and 10:30, all about 1 mile off the coast. One or more of these may have been seen. 36 about 0254: W told the plane about a target at 12:00 at 2 miles. P responded \"No sighting of that one.\" 37 about 0255: W told the plane that it was about to merge- with the target that had been just ahead. Since W did not have any measure of • the heights of the radar targets W could not have told the plane whether it was above, below, or level with the anomalous target. The passengers were unaware of any target close enough to \"merge\" with. However, about 0255:30 the plane said to W: \"We had a pretty bright light. We have it again now.

In order to learn the progress of the UFO study in this country, Mr. Esterle will visit the United States during the latter part of June, which will include a tour of the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston. He has requested no publicity for his visit, therefore Journal readers will be the first to know, but not until after he has returned to France. A small select group of American UFOlogists were invited, at his request, to meet in Houston for this memorable event, hosted by MUFON officers. We anticipate that we may be able to publish an account of this meeting in the July issue of the Journal, since your Director, Deputy Director, and members of VISIT attended.

The Tenth Annual MUFON UFO Symposium in San Francisco also marks the first decade of MUFON, the Mutual UFO Network, Inc., which was founded on May 31, 1969. In a short period of 10 years MUFON has become one of the world leaders in the scientific investigation of the UFO phenomenon, thanks to over 1,000 active volunteers. MUFON is probably best known for the Second Edition of our Field 18 /nuesf/gator's Manual, edited by Raymond E. Fowler, our annual international UFO symposiums, and the high caliber of professional people that occupy key leadership roles in the organization around the world. It has been an honor and a privilege for me to serve MUFON as the International Director for 9 of those 10 years. With your continued support, MUFON will show even greater strides during the next decade in resolving the UFO phenomenon. (New Zealand, Continued) to be behind Woodbourne (Blenheim Airfield) from where we are Do you have anything over there?\" W responded \"Nothing showing over there at. all.\" 38 about 0256: P asked W if there was anything in the 2:00-3:00 position with respect to the plane. W responded \"Nothing showing up 2:00-3:00 to you. I have a target just off the coast at 9:30 at 5 miles.\" The passengers may have seen targets at 9:30. P 'then described lights that looked like fishing boat •lights on the right side in the Cook Strait. W then responded \"I got just one paint now at 3:00 to you at 15 miles,\" and P said \"Roger. Sounds like some of the lights we can see scattered through the Strait.\" 39 about 0257: the plane was too high in altitude to begin its descent into Blenheim, so it did a two minute right hand orbit to lose altitude. Just before the orbit the passengers had been watching a pair of bright lights at the left of the airplane and DC was about to film them. He didn't get a chance to film them, however, because the plane turned, and when the plane had completed its turn the lights were gone. W referred to targets at 12:00 at 2 miles before the turn and at 12:00 at 10 miles as the orbit began. The plane apparently attributed these to fishing boat lights on the surface. (W radar could detect boats in the Cook Strait if they moved fast enough to exceed the minimum MTI speed.) It was probably during or just after this orbit that G pointed out the planet Venus that was just rising and. would have been visible at the attitude of the plane. 40 about 0259: coming out of the orbit the plane asked if there was a target over Picton. W responded that there was no target over Picton. This was the last anomalous light seen during the flight. The plane landed at about 0310.

Prior to his latest nomination Serra has served as International Secretary and Vice- Chairman of the organization. Serra, 24, is a socionomist by profession. UFO Research of Finland has 41 active members scattered throughout the country.. The organization is headed by a Board of Directors. The most famour member on the board is Mr. Tapani Kuningas, author of several UFO books. Kuningas now serves as Vice-Chairman. The organization has become expert on Russian rocket launchings that take place at Plesetsk near the Finnish border. The members have learned to tell rocket launchings from other phenomena. The organization publishes quarterly reports, and special reports on the more significant cases, in English. The most significant case so far studied by UFO Research of Finland was the Kallavesi Lake case involving a UFO fragment that fell into the lake in 1964. (See Journal No. 122, January 1978.) The organization corresponds actively with similar groups in other countries. STAMP DONATIONS MUFON members and Journal subscribers continue to make generous donations of cancelled foreign stamps. These are traded with a collector for current U.S. postage, helping to underwrite the cost of international UFO information exchange. We acknowledge early 1979 contributions from Ann Druffel, Pasadena, Calif., R. Bruce Jordan, Palo Alto, Calif., Willard D. Nelson, Villa Park, Calif., and Jules Vaillancourt, Ashburnharri, Mass.

Dr. Sprinkle has studied 50 such cases and has obtained information from \"abductees\" via hypnotic regression techniques. An article in the ENQUIRER'S May 1 issue discusses the possibility of invisible UFOs and occupants. The May 8 issue tells of a South Carolina auto mechanic, Bill Herrmann, who claims to have been abducted by extraterrestrials. The much-publicized film taken in New Zealand on December 31, 1978, is the subject of an article in the May 15 issue. The film has been declared genuine by Dr. Bruce Maccabee, following his investigations and analysis. (See follow- up report in this issue.) Still more comments on the New Zealand film may be found in an article in the April 17 issue of THE STAR. OMNI apparently has decided to re-instate its \"UFO Update\" column, as the May issue contains a, contribution by an APRO investigator, Harry Lebelson. This includes a summary of recent world-wide UFO activity, plus a preview of Allan Hendry's forthcoming volume, THE UFO HANDBOOK (to be published by Doubleday in July). This issue of OMNI also contains a \"confession\" by Thomas F. Monteleone that his UFO contact claim of a few years ago was a hoax. Monteleone laments his harrassment by UFO cultists, but anyone deliberately perpetrating a hoax of this nature is deserving of all the harrassment imaginable.

You live on a planet called Earth; and Earth is the third planet (of nine) which revolves around a \"rather ordinary star\" called the Sun. The Sun together with its orbiting planets and their moons are what compose our solar system. But our Sun is only one of about 100 BILLION stars, which compose our Galaxy, the Milky Way. And outside our Galaxy there are many BILLIONS of other galaxies, each a well defined system of BILLIONS of stars. Picture it this way: Imagine our Sun to be the size of a basketball. Earth now becomes a BB pellet almost 33 yards (30 meters) away. Our solar system now has a diameter of not quite two miles (3 km.). And our nearest star is another basketball over 4,900 miles (8,000 km.) away. Now picture 100 BILLION basketballs scattered at similar separations in a disk about 125 MILLION miles (200 million km.) across. This is a model of our Galaxy reduced in scale 5 BILLION times. But, now let's imagine our Galaxy reduced to the size of a dinner plate. The universe we know of now appears as BILLIONS of dinner plates, scattered about eleven yards (10 meters) apart, in all three dimensions. If you were a Creator — and had this vast space in which to create — would you create life on only that one little BB pellet we call Earth? Note: All metric measurements, numerical quantities, \"rather ordinary star,\" and objects used in scale model (basketball, etc.) were taken from NASA publication Extragalactic Astronomy.

It is a pleasure to announce that the two following long-time MUFON members have agreed to serve. Ron Westrum, Ph.D., living at 929 South Fifth St., Ann Arbor, MI 48103, is our new State Director for Michigan. He is a professor of sociology at Eastern Michigan University, joining MUFON on December 28, 1972 as a Consultant in Sociology. Former Acting State Director, David Fideler, P.O. Box 1479, Grand Rapids, MI 49501 will become the new Assistant State Director for Michigan. David joined MUFON on August 12, 1974, and later attended the 1975 MUFON Symposium in Des Moines, Iowa and the 1976 Symposium in Ann Arbor, Mich. In 1974, he organized the Michigan Anomaly Research group that investigates (1) UFOs, (2) Bigfoot and other mystery animals, (3) haunting's and poltergeists, and (4) all types of \"paranormal\" phenomena. The Third Annual North Carolina MUFON Training Conference is scheduled for July 14 and 15, 1979 in Winston-Salem, N.C., as announced by George Fawcett, State Director and Ms. Gayle C. McBride, Secretary/ Treasurer of the Tarheel UFO Study Group. Your Director received an invitation to be a guest speaker at this conference, but reluctantly declined due to the anticipated gasoline shortage and scheduling conflicts with the 10th Annual MUFON UFO Symposium in San Francisco. An extreme amount of interest was created worldwide by the French government when they established the organization \"Groupe d'Etudes Des Phenomenes Aerospatiaux Non- Identifiees\" (GEPAN) under the direction of Dr. Claude Poher in 1977. The first summary of their work, devoted to eleven UFO cases of high credibility and strangeness, has been produced in five volumes of 500 pages titled \"Presentation of the Scientific Counsel of G.E.P.A.N. of Studies Undertaken During the First Semester of 1978\"; dated June 1978. At the present time, the five volumes will not be released to the public except in a proposed summarized form. A MUFON member provided the brief summary, which was published in the October-November 1978 edition of the International UFO Reporter. Upon completion of the report, Dr. Claude Poher resigned from GEPAN, and has taken an ostensible 2-year trip around the world in his sailing yacht. However, (continued on page 18)"}]
