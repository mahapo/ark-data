Downing When I published The Bible and Flying Saucers in 1968, the Betty and Barney Hill abduction case was just coming into public consciousness, and did not play a role when I wrote my book. On the surface, at least, there were no religious implications to the Hill abduction. The scenario is this: a UFO trails the Hills, they see it, won- der what it is, then it closes in, seems to control Barney's mind, he drives off to a side road where the aliens take him and Betty on board to examine them. The Hills are then put back in their car, with missing memory of the event, and missing time in their lives. Their memory of the event is later recovered through hypnosis. Since that time, the abduction phenomenon has be- come a central, although ambiguous, part of UFO stud- ies. In past articles in the MUFON UFO Journal I have discussed the religious implications of Whitley Strieber's abduction experiences (\"Holy Communion,\" April 1987, \"Strieber and the God Hypothesis,\" No- vember 1988). The abduction experiences of Betty Andreasson Luca chronicled by Raymond Fowler also have a pow- erful spiritual dimension. Researchers have not been sure whether the UFO reality caused these experiences in Strieber and Andreasson, or if the abductees have in some unconscious way projected their own spiritual- ity onto their experience. The Fox TV network has led the way in providing dramatic fiction linking UFOs with spirituality, begin- ning with the popular \"The X-Files,\" and now with a new program staring John Corbett called \"The Visi- tor.\" The premise of \"The Visitor\" is this: John Corbett plays the role of a man who on July 4, 1947, is ab- ducted from his plane over the Bermuda Triangle. For the past 50 years he has been hanging out in another world with aliens, having his mind transformed. He learned of some terrible things on earth, stole a UFO, and flew back to earth to save us, apparently not hav- ing aged during those fifty years. Upon arriving back at planet earth, the Air Force shot him down, and now he has a mission and is on the run. Corbett has good survival skills—while in the other world he learned many things, including how to raise himself from the dead. In a later episode we discover Dr. Barry H. Downing is pastor of the Northminster Presbyterian Church, Endwell, NY, and a longtime contributer to the Journal. that our visitor/messiah has come to rescue us from a highly classified military weapon we humans are not ready to handle. What is interesting here for me is the model of the relation between the UFO reality, humanity, and ab- ductions: abductions are the means by which humans are brought to a higher level of spirituality. And the Bible seems to hold a similar view of how the key leaders in the Bible like Moses, Elijah, Jesus, Paul and John gained the power and knowledge they had, and made the local political powers want to shoot them down. More than any others, these five men have shaped Western spirituality to this day. In The Bible and Flying Saucers, I mainly focused on UFOs that were near the key leaders—the pillar of cloud and fire near Moses, the chariot of fire with Elijah, the \"bright cloud\" with Jesus at his Transfiguration, as well as his Ascension, the bright light and Paul on the road to Damascus. But abduction images are also part of the biblical story. After all, Elijah was taken up into the sky—ab- ducted—never to return, and likewise Jesus was taken up in a \"cloud,\" never to return. Furthermore, at the Transfiguration scene reported in Matthew 17, Elijah and Moses are both reported to be with Jesus—sur- prising for many reasons, not the least of which that Moses had been dead for hundreds of years, and al- though Elijah left earth alive, it had been hundreds of years since he was last seen alive. Like John Corbett, while in the other world, Moses and Elijah did not age. The biblical message seems to be this: the heavenly UFO reality, whatever it is, can take us from earth to another world, and then bring us back, just like in \"The Visitor.\" Moses and a Nation There is no direct evidence that Moses was ever abducted, but at the same time, he had the longest con- stant relation with a UFO—forty years—of anyone re- ported in the Bible. Furthermore, during the time the UFO (the pillar of cloud and fire) landed on Mt. Sinai, Moses went alone to the top of the mountain to en- counter the divine being in the UFO. One of these meetings lasted so long (forty days and nights) that the people convinced Aaron, the brother of Moses, to create a molten calf for them, because \"the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain\" (Exodus 32:1). It was during the time Moses was isolated from the people of Israel that a huge transfer of information took place, the giving not only of the Ten Command- ments, but the design of the Tabernacle, the rituals for the priesthood—everything that we have come to con-"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 January 1998 MUFON UFO Journal sider Jewish. When Moses came down from the moun- tain, his face glowed, as the body of John Corbett glowed, when he managed his own resurrection in the first episode of \"The Visitor.\" While it cannot be said that Moses was abducted here, nevertheless, his isolation with the UFO at Sinai functioned as an experience in which spiritual infor- mation was transferred. Furthermore, at least analogi- cally, the whole Jewish Exodus experience was like the abduction of a whole nation. At Passover, they were separated from Egypt, and taken into the wilderness for forty years, where they put into practice the reli- gious information given to Moses at Sinai. When the Jews crossed the Jordan River into the promised land, it was as if they were then put back on earth, and the pillar of cloud went away, leaving the Jews to do whatever they were supposed to do. Unfor- tunately, they didn't do it, and the story of prophets like Elijah is that they tried to get Israel to return to the purpose revealed at Sinai. Elijah and Jesus Elijah is famous for being taken up into the sky in a chariot of fire. What is interesting is the reaction of his prophet school to his abduction. About fifty fol- lowers had witnessed Elijah's abduction, and their re- sponse was this: \"It may be that the Spirit of the Lord has caught him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley.\" (2 Kings 2:16) They decided they should go and search for Elijah. The implication here is that they had seen this kind of thing before—that Elijah would be carried some- where—abducted—and then returned to earth. Long before Elijah's ascension, Obadiah, a servant of King Ahab, expressed his frustration at keeping track of Elijah by saying, \"As soon as I have gone from you, the Spirit of the Lord will carry you whither I know not.\" (1 Kings 18:12) We might suppose that whatever it was that set Elijah apart as a prophet, abduction ex- periences were part of the process. Notice that another term for the \"chariot of fire\" is \"the Spirit of the Lord.\" This is important because at the baptism of Jesus, we read after Jesus was baptized, \"he went up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and alighting on him, and lo, a voice from heaven, saying, \"This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.\" (Matthew 3:16,17) If the \"Spirit of God\" is also a \"chariot of fire,\" then we have a UFO event at the baptism of Jesus. The suggestion that Jesus \"went up immediately from the water\" could be translated that he was raised straight up out of the water, and that he merged with the UFO, which appeared to fly down from above like a landing dove, \"alighting on him.\" Matthew then says Jesus was \"led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.\" Mark's gospel, telling the same story, says Jesus was \"driven\" into the wilderness, or the Greek could be translated that Jesus was \"carried\" into the wilderness by the Spirit of God. This is of course consistent with the Elijah tradition. To say that Jesus was led by the Spirit of God fits the Moses tradition, following the pillar of cloud into the wilderness, whereas being \"carried\" by the Spirit of God models the Elijah tradition. The Book of Acts has a story that supports the ab- duction/baptism hypothesis. One of the disciples, Philip, is directed by an angel to an Ethiopian eunuch, a minister in the court of Candace, who is reading the book of Isaiah. Philip interprets the Isaiah passage, saying it points to Jesus as the Messiah, and the eu- nuch requests baptism. The two go into some nearby water, perform the baptism, and, after the baptism, \"the Spirit of the Lord caught up Philip and the eunuch saw him no more ... Philip was found at Azotus.\" (Acts 8:39,40) Thus in this story concerning Philip, we have the connection between baptism and a UFO abduction, a story New Testament writers would see as consistent with the tradition of Elijah, Jesus, and strange objects which descend from the sky and carry people away. New Testament scholar Sherman Johnson says that in Jewish tradition the Messiah \"does not even recog- nize his own identity and he has no power at all until Elijah comes to anoint him and make him manifest to all.\" If we accept the Elijah tradition, then we can sup- pose Matthew's account of the baptism of Jesus is fol- lowed by his abduction into another world—the wil- derness—for what? A time of isolation, a time to gain his spiritual self vision, before returning to society for his work—what Matthew calls being tested by the devil or tempter. The Bible reports that Jesus had unusual powers to heal the sick, raise the dead or even turn water to wine. None of his miracles were reported previous to his bap- tism. If his baptism was followed by some kind of ab- duction experience, as I have suggested, then we might also suppose it was there Jesus gained his superhuman power—as John Corbett in \"The Visitor\" came back from his abduction experience with super human power and knowledge. As a seminary-trained and ordained pastor, I must admit the above interpretation of the baptism of Jesus is far removed from church tradition. But as we try to make sense of UFO abductions, scientific method de- mands that we explore the possibility that the baptism/ Spirit of God sequence at the beginning of the minis- try of Jesus was an abduction experience, even though from the point of view of religious orthodoxy, this seems highly unlikely. I believe much we are doing in UFO research raises huge questions for religious faith—we can avoid the questions only by not asking them. Paul and John The Apostle Paul was converted by something like a UFO close encounter on the road to Damascus, wit-"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal January 1998 PageS nessed by several people (Acts 9), but it does not ap- pear that he was abducted at this time. But at a later time he describes this personal expe- rience: \"I must boast; there is nothing to be gained by it, but I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord.\" He goes on to say he was taken to another world, \"whether in the body or out of the body, I do not know, God knows,\" and in this other world he \"heard things that cannot be told, which man may not utter.\" (2 Corinthians 12:1-4) The fact that Paul felt he was taken somewhere, but that he could not be sure of the physicality of the experience—in the body or out of the body—is very close to the language Whitley Strieber has used to de- scribe some of his experiences. The Apostle John explains the information he re- ceives in his famous book of Revelation this way: \"I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet.\" (1:10) If being \"in the Spirit\" is not just a psychic state, but the equivalent of being \"in a chariot of fire,\" then John's Revelation may have been part of a UFO ab- duction experience, an experience or vision that is not unlike the voice of God heard by Betty Andreasson during her abduction. I obviously do not know if any of the biblical people were abducted by UFOs. But our culture, in popular TV shows like \"The Visitor,\" can now imagine that humans might be abducted, and then be placed back on earth to carry out some kind of spiritual mission of salvation. My main point is this: such an idea would not be foreign to biblical thinking. It is foreign to the way religious leaders today think about the Bible, but I do not believe it is foreign to the Bible. I realize this point of view is inconvenient for both religious traditionalists, and for scientists who do not want religion mixed with their UFO research. The ghost of Marshall Applewhite will haunt us all for some time to come. But life is frequently inconvenient, especially in UFO research.

The next cat- egory involves extensive and long-lasting injuries. John Schuessler Injuries sustained in a number of the aforementioned cases may have had long-lasting effects, but due to the lack of proper medical follow-up, there is no way of quantifying the full extent of the injuries. However, long-term follow-up is possible as demonstrated in the Cash-Landrum incident of December 29, 1980. The Cash-Landrum Incident The Cash-Landrum incident involved three people living in the small east Texas town of Dayton. At the time of the incident the three were riding in a new 1980 Oldsmobile Cutlass on Farm to Market Road FM1485, near the town of Huffman. The driver was Betty Cash, a 51-year-old business- woman who operated a roadside restaurant and an ad- joining food market near Dayton. She was a person of unbounded energy and a drive to succeed. She was to open a new and larger restaurant the very next week— a plan that was permanently interrupted by the UFO encounter. Vickie Landrum, an employee in the restaurant op- erated by Mrs. Cash, was in the right front seat of the car. She was a 57-year-old grandmother, in good health, with a quick wit and pleasant personality. Her life re- volved around her grandson Colby for whom she had legal custody. Her activities included working in the restaurant, going to church, taking care of her family duties, and raising Colby. Her only source of entertainment was an occasional game of bingo. The third person involved in the encounter was Colby. At that time he was a seven-year-old active and healthy lad. He was active in baseball, bowling, dirt bike riding, and fishing, and he was skilled at each. His record showed he was good in school also. Before they encountered the UFO the trio had set out to find a bingo game. Mrs. Landrum, excited about the opportunity for a short-break in her busy routine, convinced Mrs. Cash to try bingo also. The trio stopped"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Page 6 January 1998 MUFON UFO Journal in a nearby town to pay the rent on the new restaurant, and then they drove to a number of other small towns in their East Texas locale, hoping to find a bingo game. Instead, they found that everyone was busily prepar- ing for the upcoming New Year's Eve celebration. All bingo parlors were closed. By this time they were hungry, so they stopped at a diner in New Caney. Mrs. Cash always enjoyed \"siz- ing up the competition.\" When they finished eating they began their drive back to Dayton, chatting about memo- ries of their past and their dreams for the future. It had been a good day. A bright light About 9:00 p.m. they were driving down FM1485, returning to Dayton. Although the sky had been partly cloudy all day, it had finally cleared. Colby, standing up in the back of the car looking between the two women called their attention to a very bright light above the tall pine trees ahead. As they neared the light, it moved over the road as if it was going to land. They were all able to see it was a large diamond-shaped vehicle of some kind. Flames belched from the bottom of the craft and Mrs. Landrum described it as \"a cone of fire\" like a rocket launch. Because Mrs. Landrum and Colby were scream- ing at her to stop the car or be burned alive, Mrs. Cash halted the big Oldsmobile right in the middle of the road. For a few moments they sat there and stared in- tently at the huge object. Later they described what they saw as being a \"diamond of fire.\" It was as large at the water supply tower in their hometown of Day- ton. Car warms rapidly Although the night was a chilly forty degrees, their car warmed rapidly, forcing them to get outside. Mrs. Landrum, on the right side of the car, stood in the open doorway with her left hand on top of the car. She never took her eyes off the strange craft. Within minutes the terrified Colby convinced her to return to the inside of the car to hold him. In the mean- time, Mrs. Cash had walked to the front of the car, shielding her eyes with her arm, while staring at the object. The object hovered over the road for several min- utes, intermittently blasting flames downward, while continuously emitting a beeping sound. It is interesting to note that none of the victims called this strange craft a UFO or a flying saucer. For one reason, there was no room in Mrs. Landrum's con- servative religious upbringing for UFOs. She even rejected the concept of life elsewhere in the universe. She said \"it,\" the object, had to be one of ours, meaning operated by the U.S. Government. After a lapse of seven to ten minutes Mrs. Cash moved back to enter the car. However, she found the door handle too hot to touch and had to use her leather coat as a hot pad to protect her fingers so she could open the door. About that same time, the bright object stopped belching flames and slowly rose into the night sky and moved away just above the trees. As it flew away, heli- copters flew over the area as if in pursuit. The incident did not end there. Mrs. Cash sped down the dark and twisting road, intent on getting to the safety of her home. Within five minutes they were at the junction of a larger highway, which they had hoped would carry them safely home. Instead of find- ing a safe haven, they had caught up with the object and its helicopter escort. Determined she would not get near the thing again, Mrs. Cash pulled the car off to the side of the road and waited. Each of them commented excitedly as they busily counted the number of helicopters overhead. There were 23 in all. The stop-start game continued until the object was far enough away for them to head down Highway FM 1960 towards Dayton. Initially, they felt the heat and were sensitive to the bright light emitted by the object. However, as they drove homeward they developed headaches and gen- erally felt disturbed by the events of the evening. More severe symptoms During the night that followed they developed much more severe symptoms. Colby vomited repeat- edly and his skin turned red as if he had a severe sun- burn. Mrs. Landrum knew that was impossible because the day had been cool and overcast, with intermittent drizzle. When she examined herself, Mrs. Landrum found she had a similar skin burn problem. Mrs. Cash had an even worse burn. Large water blisters formed on her face and head and by morning her eyes had swollen shut. During the holiday period none of them could eat or drink. Even water would make them vomit again and again. They developed diarrhea and their state of health deteriorated continuously. Finally, Mrs. Landrum had a relative come and take Mrs. Cash to a hospital where she was treated as a burn patient. This was the first of more than two dozen periods of hospital con- finement for Mrs. Cash. A very brief summary of the medical problems they sustained follows: Eyes swollen closed, painful and watery Eyes permanently damaged Stomach pains, vomiting, and diarrhea Sores and scarring of skin, with loss of pigmentation Excessive hair loss over a several week period New hair had a different texture Loss of appetite, energy and weight Fingernail damage and shedding Increased susceptibility to disease Cancer Next month, Part 4: physiological effects from abduction experiences."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal January 1998 Page? R. J. Durant The Roswell debris testimony of Dr. Jesse Marcel, Jr. By Robert J. Durant This article is in response to an article by Kent Jef- frey, titled \"Roswell—Anatomy of a Myth\", pub- lished in the MUFON UFO Journal, July 1997 is- sue number 350, that created major controversy in the UFO community. (Walter Andrus) The interrogation under hypnosis of Dr. Jesse Marcel, Jr. is examined. It is demonstrated that, con- trary to the claims of Mr. Kent Jeffrey, the material Marcel handled was not associated with a weather bal- loon radar target, and in particular that it was not the radar target shown to the press by General Ramey in July 1947. Introduction Among the many reasons Kent Jeffrey gives for concluding that the Roswell Event was caused by noth- ing more than the debris from a Project Mogul balloon array is the testimony of Jesse Marcel, Jr. In July 1947 Marcel and his mother were awakened by his father, Major Jesse Marcel, who had just returned from the Foster Ranch. The Major was excited, and proceeded to show his wife and son a collection of the material he had gathered at the ranch. Over the years Dr. Marcel has spoken in many forums about what he saw on that fateful night, and his account has remained remarkably stable. In January of 1997 Mr. Jeffrey arranged for an in- terrogation under hypnosis by Dr. Neil Hibler, a spe- cialist in the use of hypnosis for information retrieval through memory enhancement. Hibler's credentials are impressive, and include extensive work for law enforce- ment agencies and federal intelligence services. An artist was also present to record in visual form what Dr. Marcel recalled. The interrogation was comprised of three sessions, each lasting a little more than two hours. A video tape was made of the entire procedure. I was among a handful of ufologists to whom Mr. Jeffrey sent copies of the video tapes of the interroga- tion. Assuming that the tapes were mine to keep, I viewed them in four or five sessions, but did not make audio or video copies. Nor did I take notes during the viewing. However, I watched the proceedings with very keen attention, and recall vividly those points where Dr. Marcel touched on specific topics that I thought were of vital importance. My concern was to determine, if possible, what he was describing. Alternatively, I wanted to gather enough detail from his testimony to tell what he was not describing. Dur- ing this viewing I was fully aware that the received opinion in some quarters, including the U.S. Air Force was that he had handled the remains of a balloon-borne radar target, and I was using that as a specific point of comparison with his testimony. Almost immediately after I viewed the tapes, I be- gan composing notes and a preliminary analysis for the purpose of sharing my thoughts with Mr. Jeffrey and the other \"insiders.\" Were it not for that, I could not write the comments that follow, because several days later I received a tele- phone call from Mr. Jeffrey abruptly requesting that I return the tapes at my earliest possible convenience. I complied, and I also complied with his previous re- quest that the tapes not be copied or reproduced in any way. Within hours of his call, I fedexed the tapes to Mr. Jeffrey. Now Mr. Jeffrey tells me he does not intend to re- lease the video tapes or transcripts, even to other re- searchers, but that he is planning to use the tapes on a network television program about Roswell! Thus the scholarly community is deprived of the chance to ex- amine this very valuable document, just as the readers of the MUFON UFO Journal were deprived of the op- portunity to examine what Dr. Marcel said during his six hours of interrogation. Although he devoted a great deal of space to the interrogation, Mr. Jeffrey does not offer the reader a single quotation from the testimony. The reader is left with nothing but Mr. Jeffrey's personal editorial inter- pretation of the meaning of the testimony that took over six hours to elicit. Kent Jeffrey's Thesis Here is what Mr. Jeffrey had to say concerning Dr. Marcel and his testimony: \"Potentially, the key to the whole Roswell UFO case lies in Jesse Marcel, Jr.'s memory. He saw the debris. Either it was extraterrestrial or it was not. \"There were no descriptions or memories of any kind of exotic debris or wreckage. And, immediately following with the editorial interpretation \"There is a very good reason for that — there simply was no such exotic debris or wreckage for Jesse to remember. If there had been, in all probability he would have remembered it consciously. Nonetheless, because of the extreme importance of the debris to the Roswell case, the effort was worth a try — just in case. \"The sessions made it absolutely clear that the ma- terial recovered from the Foster ranch northwest of Roswell in 1947 was anything but unique or exotic. As it turned out, it was extremely mundane.\" In addition to being mundane, the material recov- ered from the Foster ranch is definitely reconcilable with the debris from an ML-307 radar reflector — the length and cross-sectional size of the beams or sticks, the pieces of foil, and the plastic-like material (now thought to be part of one of the plastic ballast cases that contained sand) Even the color of the symbols that"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PageS January 1998 MUFON UFO Journal Jesse, Jr. remembers is almost identical to the color of the flower patterns on the balsa stick that Irving New- ton remembers seeing in Ramey s office. And finally, commenting on the journalist's pho- tographs of debris on General Ramey's office floor, \"There is absolutely no question that this is the debris from an ML-307 radar reflector. If this is the same de- bris that was recovered from the Foster ranch, then the Roswell case is closed, period. Its over, end of sub- ject.\" Mr. Jeffrey confuses two different topics. His in- vocation of the terms \"exotic\" and \"unique\" and his antonymous \"mundane\" are apparently meant to make the point that if the Roswell debris were of extraterres- trial origin, that fact would immediately be obvious upon inspection. This is a very quick answer to a question that has vexed a great many minds over many decades. Namely, how can one establish the extraterrestrial provenance of an object? Although readers of this journal will pose the question in terms of alleged \"implants\" or items said to have been dropped by passing UFOs, the issue is a very broad one and includes the ongoing debate about life-forms in rocks thought by some scientists to have originated on Mars. The search for radio signals from extraterrestrial civilizations has been underway since 1959. A central issue of SETI that has never been resolved is how to determine in rigorous terms if a signal is in fact extraterrestrial. In sum, Mr. Jeffrey may have an easy answer, but a multitude of thoughtful scholars and scientists would demur. Elsewhere in his paper, Mr. Jeffrey equates com- plexity with extraterrestrial origin, citing modern jet airliners and their humble predecessor, the Sopwith Camel. He might have added that a jetliner operated by the airline that employs him recently lost part of a flap, a very simple part of the very complex airplane that lost it. Puzzled bystanders who found the flap had to wait several days before it was identifed by experts. To the best of my knowledge, the debris brought home by Major Marcel has never been thought to be the entirety of an interplanetary craft. Rather, if in fact it was extraterrestrial, it may have been a covering, or something jettisoned or fallen by mishap like the Jetliner's flap. There is no reason to suppose that he even implied that what he had found was a space craft, as distinguished from miscellaneous and structurally simple detritus \"not of this earth.\" If we try to insist that both the Major and his son were talking about a craft, we are putting words in their mouths. Worse, we are creating a straw man to tear apart, and making logical analysis of this profound puzzle even more difficult. In any event, the point made by Mr. Jeffrey is beyond the scope of my comments, and I will freely admit, beyond my ability to plumb. The second topic is much easier to deal with. De- spite Mr. Jeffrey's urgings, it is entirely separate from the problem of defining \"exotic\" and \"mundane\" and Brig. Gen. Roger Ramey, commanding general of the Eighth Army Air Force, kneeling, and his Chief of Staff, Col. Thomas Debose, with what is claimed to be debris from the Roswell crash. so on. Specifically, it is the question, \"Does Dr. Marcel's testimony under the hypnotic interrogation (or in any other venue) lead to the conclusion that the material he inspected in his kitchen was the remains of a balloon- borne radar reflector target?\" To paraphrase Mr. Jeffrey, if Dr. Marcel's testimony shows that he handled and inspected the remains of a radar reflector, then the Roswell case is closed, period. But I don't agree that the testimony shows anything of the son. Upon careful consideration of what Dr. Marcel had to say, and comparison of that very carefully elic- ited six hours of testimony with what is known about the MIL-307 target, one reaches quite the opposite con- clusion. The Interrogation Dr. Hibler began with a very informative discus- sion of hypnosis, with particular emphasis on its use in enhancement of memory. He explained that about 20% of the population is easily hypnotizable, with the rest lying in a spectrum of capacity for hypnosis. Hypnosis is not a means of ascertaining absolute truth, but has been shown to be very useful in obtaining certain types of details hidden in the memory.

Several induction techniques were attempted, but with little apparent success. It appeared to me that Dr. Marcel was never in a trance, in my layman's under- standing of that term. Marcel was outwardly calm, friendly and cooperative, but seemed tense inwardly and uneasy about the process. At one point Dr. Hibler said that Dr. Marcel was very intelligent and alert to everything going on in the room, and that he was an extremely self-reliant type of personality. I gathered that Dr. Hibler made this com- ment as an objective assessment of Dr. Marcel, but also by way of venting in a subtle way his frustration at his inability to induce a trance. By the end of the third and final session, Dr. Marcel had become much more relaxed and had his eyes closed. Whether he was finally in a hypnotic trance, I can't say. His speech patterns did not change from those in the earlier sessions, but he did,seem at last to be detaching from the immediate environment and reach- ing far into the depths of his memory. After the first attempts at inducing a trance, Dr. Hibler began asking a series of questions. The bulk of the questioning was done by the hypnotist. During the later sessions, questions were asked by Mr. Jeffrey, and then by the artist. The questioning took place in a pattern that pro- ceeded from vague queries posed in very general lan- guage at the outset, and then became quite specific to- ward the end of the last session. Nearly every relevant topic was raised at least several times. Questioning was interspersed with further attempts at hypnosis and little \"pep talks\" designed to relax the still tense Dr. Marcel. The artist was present during all three sessions. She did not intrude into the conversations until late in the third session. At that point it came as a shock to dis- cover that she had been drawing throughout the ses- sions, and when Dr. Marcel was shown what she had drawn simply from listening to him talk, he was as amazed as I was. Dr. Marcel pronounced her work nearly perfect. At his suggestion she made a few mi- nor changes to the drawings. The patience and skill of the hypnotist, and the skill of the artist remain as highlights of the interrogation video. Mr. Jeffrey did an excellent job of briefing the hypnotist on the outlines of the issue at hand, allowing Dr. Hibler to handle very competently a line of ques- tioning much more complicated than asking someone to recall a license plate. At the beginning, Dr. Marcel could not recall how he or his father or his mother were dressed, who woke him, or what was in his father's car when he followed him outside after the \"debris\" had been examined in the kitchen. During the final session, Dr. Marcel re- called with ease that his father was in uniform, that his mother was dressed in a bathrobe with a flowered pat- tern, that he was wearing a plaid bathrobe and slip- pers, and that he had been awakened by his father. He even remembered some of the items in his bedroom. The Kitchen Floor When Dr. Marcel appeared in the kitchen, he found his mother and his father. A collection of strange ma- terial had been spread on the kitchen floor. This mate- rial was comprised of three distinct types, and only three, which by common consent we have come to designate as the \"foil,\" the \"I-beam\" and the \"bakelite.\" This comprised the entirety of the material seen by Dr. Marcel. Unlike his mother, who did not handle any of the material with special care, Dr. Marcel spent what he estimates as 15 to 20 minutes handling and looking at it. At least some of this time was devoted to an at- tempt by the family to arrange the segments of \"foil\" as one would coordinate the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. The nature of the size and shape of the \"foil\" was such that it suggested a common and complete integral form prior to its reduction to the many disparate parts ar- ranged on the floor. There was no success in this at- tempt, either in the grand scheme or in connecting the edges of even two pieces. Dr. Marcel was not asked, nor did he volunteer, how many pieces of \"foil\" there were, but the implication from this and other testimony is that there were many. Dr. Marcel paid particular attention to the single I- beam,\" handling and observing it with great care, and viewing it from various perspectives with the kitchen light behind his shoulder. It was during this inspection that he observed the \"hieroglyphics,\" and brought them to the attention of his parents. One aspect of the story that Dr. Marcel emphasized by repetition during various phases of the sessions is that his father was plainly very excited. Although he was quizzed on this topic, Dr. Marcel was unable to offer a hint about the cause of his excitement. His mother seems to have been emotionally neutral and ambivalent, as was the young Marcel. On several occasions during the inspection and han- dling of the debris, Major Marcel asked his son to look for electronic parts such as resistors, capacitors and tubes. None were found. Dr. Marcel does not know why his father was eager to find such components, or why he apparently expected them to be in the collec- tion of debris. After the inspection, the material was gathered from the floor and replaced in the cardboard box. A very small amount, consisting of little shreds, was left on the kitchen floor. His mother swept the floor, and us- ing a broom moved these tiny pieces out of the kitchen through the door into the backyard. Dr. Marcel believes it probable, but not certain, that the shreds were com- posed of the \"foil\" material. Dr. Marcel's father carried the box out of the house to his car, with the boy following. The box was placed in the back seat. There was more material on the seat that appeared to be the same as that which he had ex- amined in the kitchen, but Dr. Marcel did not get a good look it and can't recall either the exact nature or quantity of that material."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"PagelO January 1998 MUFON UFO Journal His father drove off to the air base, and Dr. Marcel went back to sleep. He remembers his activity of the next morning, which consisted of bicycle riding with two close friends. He did not mention to them his ex- perience of the previous night, and says it did not pre- occupy him. It is most unfortunate that Major Marcel did not explain the reason for his excitement. It is consistent with what he told researchers 31 years later, when he was still in awe of what he had found on the Foster Ranch and said he thought it was \"not of this world.\" Whether that specific conclusion was in his mind when he presented the material to his family, or whether he drew it pursuant to additional information gleaned in the days that followed, we have no way of knowing. But it is a fact that time did not dull his perception that there was something exceptional about the substances he found. Nor do we know why the Major expected to find electronic parts in the box. But this implies that the material in the box had been gathered in such great haste that even a cursory inspection had not been made. When these events took place, Dr. Marcel was one month shy of his twelfth birthday. He was by all ac- counts an unusually precocious youngster, who was offered a scholarship to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology when he graduated from high school. He declined that honor, having already decided to pursue a career in medicine. The Mogul Hypothesis The U.S. Air Force, drawing on work done by re- searchers such as Robert Todd and Professor C. B. Moore, has concluded that the debris in General Ramey's office was that of a Project Mogul balloon array. These arrays consisted of many balloons lifting an instrument package aiid several radar reflectors. The array or \"train\" configuration varied during the course of the experimental launchings. Of particular impor- tance in this hypothesis is the rarity of the radar reflec- tors, which have been described as box kites made of balsa wood structural members supporting metal foil surfaces that reflect radar waves. At the time in question, reports of \"flying saucers\" were widespread, and when rancher Mac Brazel found the remains of a Mogul array he assumed it must be a \"saucer.\" According to the Air Force, Major Marcel, being ignorant of the radar targets, gathered the mate- rial and took it to the 509th Bomb Group, where con- fusion about the real nature of the debris continued, and a stupidly contrived press release was issued claim- ing that a \"flying saucer\" had been found. The follow- ing day the debris was identified as nothing more than a battered radar reflector. Thirty years passed. Then, through a combina- tion of poor memory, confabulation and some out- right lying, the story of a crashed spacecraft re- emerged. Mr. Jeffrey has embraced this explanation for the central event that launched what he now calls the Roswell Myth. The consensus of the skeptical community is that the Mogul array launched on June 4, 1947 was the source of the debris found by Brazel and then deliv- ered by Major Marcel to his Army unit. According to C. B. Moore, this array consisted of 28 balloons lifting a plastic container of kerosene ballast and three radar reflector targets. Unlike other Mogul test flights, this one did not carry a \"radiosonde\" transmitter. Testing the Hypothesis The Mogul Balloon Hypothesis is falsifiable, that is to say, it is amenable to testing. Thanks to the initia- tive and largesse of Mr. Jeffrey, and to the exceptional skill of the professionals he employed, we have a very detailed and reliable description from Dr. Marcel of the material he observed with great care. This description can be compared, point by point, with the known characteristics of a radar target. Al- though such a target probably exists in the collections of aviation museums and should have been easily avail- able to the skeptics, most especially to the U.S. Air Force, they have neglected to sit down with Dr. Marcel and a target and ask him the obvious question: Is this what you handled? In July 1997, on his own initiative, Dr. Marcel trav- eled to Socorro, New Mexico to visit C. B. Moore at his home, where he at last was able to examine a radar target. Marcel told Moore that the target was simply not what he had handled 50 years ago in his kitchen. However, we have nearly the same thing as a radar target, which is actually more usefull for the purposes of establishing if the debris shown to journalists by General Ramey was the same as the debris brought home by Major Marcel. I refer to the set of very clear photographs taken in Ramey's office by the professional press photographer J. Bond Johnson. With the excep- tion that it denies us the tactile sense a real target could provide, the photographs are entirely sufficient to the purpose. In the remarks that follow I will examine the \"foil,\" the \"bakelite\" and the \"rod,\" comparing the testimony of Dr. Marcel with the known qualities of an ML-307 radar target. Due to the intransigence of Mr. Jeffrey, I must rely on my recollection and notes instead of be- ing able to supply the exact language used by the wit- ness. The Metal Foil The bulk of the material in the kitchen consisted of pieces of what Dr. Marcel calls metal foil. These came in various sizes, the largest being about four by six inches. They were nearly weightless. They did not flex in his hands. Dr. Marcel has no recollection of an attempt to flex or deform these pieces by conscious effort. However, they did not change shape or flex while he was handling them. The \"foil\" was the color of \"lead\" foil, a dull me- tallic color. He compares the color with that of the foil"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal January 1998 Page 11 in packages of ciga- rettes, but seemingly with little confidence. It is only his best choice of description, not an exact one. Also, he was refer- ring to cigarette pack- ages circa 1947, which used metal foils much different from modern wrapping materials. He was well familiar with standard cigarette pack- age foil, having saved it for the war effort. Dr. Marcel is ada- mant that there was no paper attached to either side of the \"foil.\" Nor did he observe paper or tape attached to or pro- Maj. Jesse A. Marcel, S-2 (In- telligence) officer, poses for photo in Brig. Gen. Barney's office. truding from the \"foil\" in any way. The \"foil\" was de- void of any markings or symbols. Moreover, it had no signs of creasing or of abrasion. It is important to note that Dr. Marcel is not describing metal foil, but rather the color of the thin, mysterious material whose com- position he could not describe. In response to the many questions he was asked about the foil, he could have said that it felt like ciga- rette foil, was as thick as cigarette foil, and so forth, but he did not. An excellent depiction of a typical piece of the \"foil\" was made by the artist, but Mr. Jeffrey chose not to use it to illustrate his article. He was not asked how many pieces of \"foil\" he handled, leaving open the possibility that some of the pieces did have paper backing, creases, abrasions, and so forth, but were not among those he inspected or handled. On the other hand, much of the time Dr. Marcel was looking at the material was devoted to the attempt to piece together the fragments into a matching whole. This exercise was done by placing the pieces on the kitchen floor. The attempt was abandoned without find- ing a \"fit\" or a \"match\" for the edges of even two pieces. When all of the material was removed from the cardboard box and placed on the floor, it occupied about two-thirds of the area of the floor. The witness believes the area of the floor was roughly eight by ten feet. If that is so, the material would have comprised the re- mains of more than three radar reflectors. The surface area of an intact, undamaged reflector is 14 square feet. Although Dr. Marcel can't recall how much additional material was left in the back seat of his father's car, it could easily have amounted to the equivalent of several more reflectors. According to the Mogul hypothesis the \"foil\" was the reflecting surface material from either one or two or three of the radar reflectors. As the balloon array gently fell and was carried along by the prevailing wind, the reflectors were dragged over the ground, snapping the thin balsa wood supporting members and tearing the paper-foil reflecting surfaces. Will this process applied to a lamination of paper and metallic foil result in a multitude of small pieces, independent and cleanly differentiated from each other, none adhering in any way to the others? It seems very unlikely. In addition to the detailed verbal descriptions from the witness about the appearance of the tearing patterns forming the periphery of the \"foil\" pieces, we also have the artist's vivid depiction. According to Dr. Marcel, each piece was flat, and there were neither creases, scratches nor abrasions on any piece he examined, This debris was collected from the rough ground of the Foster Ranch, then jammed into a cardboard box, then removed from that box and examined and dumped on the kitchen floor. But with all of these opportunities for abrasion or deformation, the paper-foil covering of what we are asked to believe was a radar target somehow slipped through untouched. Incredibly, while the delicate foil surface remained pristine, the radar target had been ripped into many small pieces, the largest of which measured only four by six inches! But the real test is the comparison between what Dr. Marcel tells us and the photographs taken of the debris in General Ramey's office. At this point I invite the reader's attention to the photograph on the cover of the June 1997 MUFON UFO Journal. (Editor's Note: the photo appears on page 8 in this issue.) This is the photograph illustrating the article by Mr. Jeffrey in which he invokes the Marcel interroga- tion as a pivotal argument against the anomalous na- ture of the Ros well Event. I offer the same photograph, but by way of proving Mr. Jeffrey wrong. At the risk of elaborating the obvious, note that the radar reflector is virtually intact. Where is the multi- tude of tiny pieces spoken of by Dr. Marcel? Would anyone worry over the debris in this photograph, try- ing to piece it together like a jigsaw puzzle? Observe the universal creasing and folding that is so evident. This is consistent with the paper-foil laminate that you are looking at. Are any of the pieces flat? Even the major, supported pieces bend and flow. If Mr. Jeffrey's article had included the artist's drawing of the \"foil,\" the reader could compare the obviously different tear patterns on the edges with those on the artist's depic- tion made at the Marcel interrogation. The paper back- ing for the foil is evident in many of the pieces, and along the edges of the intact major sections. In sum, the description of the foil brought home by Major Marcel conflicts in every particular with what we see on the floor of General Ramey's office.

David Spencer MUFON Deputy Director, Investigations Rather than simple, almost momentary events, a sighting can take place over a significant amount of time and involve complex interactions with the object.

Index = 52% Investigators: Beverly Trout, Irene Barnes, Lawrence Lacey, Robert Lyon (This exceptional case in- volving a family over a period of two months could almost be a CE-4, but the current sup- porting evidence is circumstantial and speculative. The events tend to agree with the hypothesis that once a person has a sighting, he/she is likely to have a num- ber of others. The investigators, led by Beverly Trout, have done excellent work keeping up with the events as they occurred) A friend of the witnesses called the local airport about the sighting and was given the National UFO Reporting Center (Davenport), which led to the caller obtaining the telephone number of Beverly Trout. The National UFO Reporting Center indicated that other sightings had been made that same night, in Washing- ton state and Electric City, South Dakota. The MUFON investigation began Aug. 9. After picking up his 11-year-old nephew to take him to his grandmother's, a man (age 21) drove east- ward through Stone State Park on a partly cloudy night. With his window cracked open, the two may not have been able to hear any approaching vehicle over the loud- ness of the music on the radio, but their attention was attracted to a light on their left. Through the trees, they could see an amber light which appeared to also be going eastward at about their speed (20 miles-per-hour in the park) a few hundred feet from them. After making a sharp curve in the road, their new aspect of the object—now about 400 feet from them and possibly 200 feet above ground—revealed it had three separate lights. Their view was hampered by the trees, which sometimes blocked the image completely during the two-mile journey to the park's exit. After they exited the park area, the object turned toward them to loop almost 180 degrees and broke clear of the trees, crossing the road slightly behind the car in the process. Now having a clear view, the man and boy watched fearfully as the object banked to its right, revealing its underside, and moved northwesterly out of sight. The faint glowing of three lights outlined a 60 to 70-foot triangular shape, and the lights were at its corners. They were badly shaken and felt threatened by the large object. The man reflected on a past experience of a woman-like figure coming to him while he was va- cationing in Florida, then again in Sioux City. He also remembered ghostly 4 -like \"angels\" he had seen at the foot of his bed, and on other occasions of waking as a child and being frightened. Two years earlier, the man and a friend had seen an unexplainable blinding light in the otherwise unlit bathroom. He had seen black, four-foot figures on sev- eral occasions, one while with a friend who also saw them. His sister had told him of strange dreams involv- ing frog-like men with \"bumpy skin and webbed hands.\" She had said these men once appeared to her even outside of a dream, standing by her closet and trying to console her. The two were still recovering as they turned off the main road onto the road of their destination. A hard bump on the passenger-side door startled both of them to quickly look to their right, where they saw a snarl- ing, hyena-like animal. Big red lights in place of eyes and huge teeth offset a short, pointed nose and small ears. The fur—tan, striped and spotted with black— covered a hump on the animal's back and taut, bulging muscles over the body. They finally arrived at the home of the man's mother (the nephew's grandmother), and the three of them, still outside, had other sightings during the next 15 minutes. The mother noticed an amber globe to the west, about a mile away. Alerted to the object, the man saw the globe split into two globes—one globe being at a different alti- tude—then merging back as one. The mother saw four lights \"popping out of the center\" of the globe, merg- ing, fading in intensity, then separating again and re- peating the process. All lights appeared to be about the same size as the original. To her, it was \"like being at a circus.\" While watching the amber globe, another object toward the southwest and a little closer, moving ex- tremely slowly, caught their attention. It was another, but much larger (300 feet), triangle. Three yellow-white lights outlined the shape of the retreating object, and the boy saw red and blue lights along one side. The mother grabbed her throw-away Kodak cam- era and, failing to locate the viewfinder in time, pointed it in the general direction and snapped pictures. Un- fortunately, the developed pictures were not descrip- tive.) Suddenly, both objects disappeared. The three climbed into the man's car and retraced"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal January 1998 Page 13 the route they had taken through the park, but to no avail. The boy had a very realistic nightmare that night of a lot of hands feeling him, heads without faces, be- ing carried on a \"couch,\" experiencing a needle, and being unable to move. He woke up crying, and, after- ward, became reluctant to sleep in his bedroom. The next day, they searched for any residual evi- dence of the objects seen at the home. Nothing was located, but this did not conclude the family's unusual experiences for August. Unusual puncture wound When the boy's grandmother saw an unusual punc- ture wound on his little finger on Aug. 10, she exam- ined him more closely and found another puncture on the top of his little toe. On Aug. 20, the man went outside the house with his mother and saw a distant, diamond-shaped, spin- ning object sparkling \"like a rainbow,\" with red, blue, white, green and yellow lights west of the house, near where the amber globe had been seen. On Aug. 22, the man and his mother saw another object having rotating red, blue, and green lights and watched it through binoculars while horses neighed and dogs barked around them. On Aug. 24, a 20 to 30-feet diameter saucer-shaped object was seen that had a revolving red light on its top, green and blue lights on its side, and a halo of light bright enough to illuminate a nearby hill. It hov- ered less than a mile away and they watched it through binoculars. At about 20:30 hours that evening, the man's sis- ter saw a yellowish-green ball that was expanding (puff- ing up) and contracting like a jellyfish. Two hours later, she saw an object moving very slowly toward her from the north, at a low (100-feet) altitude. With a bright white light on the front and underneath and red lights at each of its three corners, defining a triangle, it seemed to be \"all lights.\" It emitted a muffled humming sound as it approached then circled to the west and away. Friend sketches object The same or similar object was observed in mid- September and was sketched by a friend of the family. The sketch was of a triangular object having white lights at the bottom of each corner, another at its bot- tom center, and a spotlight at the front of one corner. A red light was beside each of the two other corners. The object had suddenly appeared in the north and had slowly moved straight toward the house, then banked westward when it was over the front yard. At a distance of about one-half mile, it had swung back within a block of the house. It had then straightened its path and had flown off to the south. The mother was irritated by itching thighs on Aug. 27. Checking herself, she found groups of red welts; one thigh had a rectangular patch about the size of a dollar bill and the other had a two-inch square patch. Some of the welts appeared to be punctured. A burn- like mark, about the size of a penny, had appeared ear- lier on her wrist. That same day, the man and his sister returned the boy home, taking 30 minutes, but it took only ten minutes to return. The man was concerned for the lost time. Two sightings—on or about Aug. 27 and on Sept. 21—were made by the man's sister of an animal that, by its description, may have looked like a cross be- tween a deer and a dog. On Sept. 19, the man again saw the beast he had seen on Aug. 7. The man's sister and a girlfriend saw a 30-foot diameter silver disc with red, blue, and white lights gliding just above the trees 50 feet from them on Sept. 23. The girlfriend screamed when the object circled and headed in their direction, and they quickly left the area. On Sept. 28, the man drove beneath what appeared to be a cigar-shaped object with square windows. The man believes he is somehow receiving mental com- munications from the beings controlling these unusual objects. Beverly Trout, the lead investigator, has tried to help the apparently affluent family cope with their im- pression that \"aliens\" have focused on them and their suspicion that they have been abducted. The investi- gators contacted the sheriffs of two counties, the po- lice in Sioux City, and the FAA in Sioux City and Sioux Falls (SD). LOG # 97O824bC, CE-1, 03/12/97, Elkhart, IA, at 18:12 hours CST, 00:12 GMT, for 10 minutes, total. Index =27% Investigators: Beverly Trout, Irene Barnes The primary witness ignored the event for almost two months—until he saw a letter to the editor of the Des Moines Register by Beverly Trout, which gave her address. He contacted her shortly afterward. On a cold and fair early Wednesday evening in March, the main witness left Elkhart and took his daughter and her girlfriend to a church group in Ankeny, a 12 to 13-mile trip he makes every Wednesday for that purpose. The route takes them westward across an overpass of 1-35, about 1.5 miles north of a flying ser- vice, and south on highway 69. This night, after crossing 1-35, the trio noticed three very intense lights—red, blue, and light green—in a cluster to their south and about one-third of the way up from the horizon. As they watched during the one-mile drive south on highway 69, it appeared that each light first dimmed, then brightened in turn (one at a time). They lost sight of the lights shortly after turning off the highway onto another road. Returning home two hours later, the three could again see the lights southwest of them and heading north-northeastward when they turned north onto high- way 69. Turning off highway 69 to cross 1-35, heading"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Page 14 January 1998 MUFON UFO Journal eastward to Elkhart, they saw the lights stop, then re- verse their direction for a couple of seconds, rotate clockwise 1.5 turns, then head northeastward. As they crossed the 1-35 overpass, the lights all became red about 0.75 miles south of them—about the same distance north of the flying service—then dived downward at a steep angle. They saw the brake lights of the cars on the interstate closest to the lights brighten for a few moments as if a collision with the object was imminent. They temporarily lost sight of the object, but it re- appeared and climbed straight up, then moved toward Elkhart at a low altitude, going 55-60 miles-per-hour. Trees blocked their view of the lights until they reached home. Suddenly, the lights—now all white—appeared almost directly overhead, about 100 feet above them. Boomerang shape They could make out a boomerang shape about 60 feet across and 30 feet from the front to the back. It pivoted 180 degrees counter-clockwise, and the man thought he heard a \"swoosh\" sound as the turn was made. The motion was described as \"fluid,\" and the unexpected oddity made a chill go up his spine. In a couple of seconds, the object disappeared beyond the trees and buildings. The man drove to a nearby railroad on a knoll just west of his house that gave him a good view of the area, and he again saw the lights—now back to red, blue, and green. He watched them for a few seconds as they went out of sight in the southwest. From the Ankeny Airport and a local energy com- pany, the investigators learned that helicopter busi- nesses had been contracted to check out power lines, but the work did not start in the area until five days after this sighting was made. Also, the activity was usually over by 19:00 hours, and the helicopters used were turbine-driven, producing a sound that could eas- ily be heard. A member of the nearby flying service said many students practiced touch-and-go landings at night, and there is a lot of nighttime flying in the area. The dive observed by the witnesses was too far north of the fly- ing service's airport for it to be considered the likely reason the dive occurred. Also, all lights on the object were red at the time, a factor which was not explain- able by a Lt. Colonel of the Iowa National Guard.

What was perceived is ( evidence that it was more than an illusion stemming from a mundane event. Jupiter was at 30 degrees el- evation in the south, which suggests it may have been a compounding/confounding element. Judge for your- self) Late on a clear evening with light winds, the wit- ness stepped out of her mobile home to get a breath of fresh air on her lattice-enclosed patio. As she did, she saw an object which had either landed on or hovered very close to her nearby neighbor's mobile home roof and was facing her. She could see big, curved (dome-like) windows with a thin strip down the middle, and there was a bright spotlight shining from the lower front of the object. These factors describe a helicopter, but, importantly, no sound was heard and no rotors were seen. (Even the quietest of helicopters would have produced enough sound to be heard at 20-25 feet distance.) She realized she could see a pilot with \"something fitted over his head . .. like a formfitting mask,\" who was motionless as she watched. She could not distin- guish features, making it seem \"unreal to look at.\" Several small entities exit Then, two doors swung open, and several (un- counted) small entities exited. She could not see their shapes or how they moved. The bright light was di- rected at her, and she thought she was being watched. Alarmed and frightened, she went back into her house and noticed that the beam of light was illuminating its interior. The witness telephoned her sister in another State, who advised her to stay on the phone until the object left, which happened about an hour later. Then, the witness continued to watch the object as it moved around the trailer court, occasionally stopping, hover- ing, and shining its light on various mobile homes. This kept her awake for almost six hours. The witness had twice previously seen this same object over the same mobile home and had seen the pilot each time. The first, in late March or early April, was when the mobile home was not occupied, and the object left within 15 minutes. Snow was on the ground, but the next day there were no footprints visible. Dur- ing the second, in May, the object merely hovered close to the roof."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal January 1998 Page 15 Katharina Wilson UFOs and Mental Health By Bob Teets (Reviewed by Katharina Wilson) Bob Teets, author of UFOs and Mental Health, won more than 30 state and national press awards while working as a journalist in West Virginia in the 1980s. UFOs and Mental Health is a work in progress—a primer to spark interest in the subject of UFOs from the mental health commu- nity.\" The majority of Teets' Introduction is geared to- ward his sincere acknowl- edgments of thirty-year vet- eran psychologist and UFO researcher Dr. Leo Sprinkle. UFOs and Mental Health covers several loosely associated subjects while attempting to relate them to UFO phenomena. Remote viewing, the church of Satan, and spirit possession are also cov- ered. In view of this material, it is interesting that Teets does not mention Dr. Sprinkle's personal involvement with the phenomenon of channeling and also does not cover the subject of channeling in this book. UFOs and Mental Health purports to be a book for \"healers,\" Teets' preferred term for mental heath professionals and their non-degreed equivalents. Nev- ertheless, he is marketing his book to ufologists and abductees. Teets also makes it very clear at the begin- ning of this book that he believes abductees have misperceived their experiences. He writes, \"...if you are a UFO 'experiencer' (his emphasis) in search of answers to or relief from per- ceived problems associated with UFOs, you will often discover that the answers you find and/or the degree of relief you experience may well depend on which healer you choose.\" (15) Heaven's Gate tragedy One of the things I find most disturbing about UFOs and Mental Health is Teets' use of the Heaven's Gate tragedy. He uses the sad demise of this cult as a tool in his effort to pry ufologists and abduction researchers away from mainstream America; to make them appear intellectually and morally inferior to those on the \"out- side,\" in effect, making them appear as villains. A prime example follows: \"For sure, events like this will make—or should make—people think twice about any 'revealed truths' perpetrated by supposed UFO experts, believers or prophets. From now on, and in order to lead people in Katharina Wilson has shared her abduction ex- periences and research as the author of The Alien Jigsaw, The Alien Jigsaw Researcher's Supple- ment, and numerous articles & reviews. any march toward 'UFO truth,' these UFO myth per- petrators and prophets will surely have to convince their followers to keep their 'eyes on the skies' while ignoring beneath them the dead bodies of 39 more fol- lowers over whom they must tread.\" (25) Teets perpetuates the \"us and them\" belief that social psychologists often warn against when attempt- ing to build cohesion and understanding between groups of individuals with dissimilar belief systems. I find this incompatible with introducing the \"heal- ers\" of this country to the subject of ufology. I find this especially damaging to the many abductees who need and deserve much better than this from an \"award winning journalist\" addressing the mental health com- munity. It should be noted that MUFON, CUFOS, ORTK, and GAUS neither supported nor endorsed any writ- ings or thinking remotely similar to what the Heaven's Gate cult was ahout. Had Teets done a little research, he would have seen the difference between these grassroots organizations and cults. Other mistakes Other mistakes Teets makes—whether intention- ally or not—include his comment about the Stockholm Syndrome. He jumps around between what abductees feel and what John Carpenter, Whitley Strieber, and John Mack, M.D. have stated. He then throws this com- ment out: \"The Stockholm Syndrome, recognized in victims of terrorist-like captivity, is seemingly over- looked by these researchers.\" (33) Had Bob Teets done his research, he would know that (the late) Karla Turner, Ph.D., spoke and wrote about this syndrome on more than a few occasions. In addition, her mentor, Barbara Bartholic, has done the same. This brings me to a problem with this and other books written by journalists as well as some non- experiencer ufologists. For reasons unknown, they either refuse or are hesitant to read and cite informa- tion directly from the sources. The \"sources\" in the abduction phenomenon are not so much the non- experiencer-researcher, but the abductees. Teets published one article in his book by Donna Higbee titled \"Are Abductees Being Brainwashed?\" which I admit was nice to see, but what about books that have been authored by abductees? Several to choose from Why don't these so-called \"award-winning jour- nalists\" look at Dr. Karla Turner's self-published works, Taken: Inside The Alien-Human Abduction Agenda and Masquerade of Angels; or my books The Alien Jigsaw, its related Researcher's Supplement, and"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Page 16 January 1998 MUFON UFO Journal Project Open Mind? What about Leah Haley's Lost Was the Key? There are also countless monographs that have been written by abductees, as well as important books by abductees that managed to weather the major publish- ing houses editing \"machine,\" but, nevertheless, still contain valuable information. One of the latter ex- amples that immediately comes to mind is Debra Jor- dan and Kathy Mitchell's Abducted! Having provided these references to Teets, I must admit that I dread what he will do with our informa- tion. God forbid we should all end up—as Mack and Strieber did in this book—in a chapter titled \"The Prophets\"! Another research mistake Another research mistake Teets makes is with his comment relating to the movie Phenomenon, staring John Travolta. Teets writes, \"Another way that this phenomenon can take a person is on a ride of educa- tional weirdness, as researcher Robyn Andrews Quail contends she's seen demonstrated in people whose IQ's shoot up immediately after a close encounter... John Travolta did a movie not long ago which sort of high- lighted this, entitled 'Phenomenon.'\" It is obvious that, once again, Teets did not do his research. The movie Phenomenon had nothing to do with UFOs! Travolta's character had a brain tumor which, in the end, killed him. There are portions of this book that ramble on so much I simply gave up at times and had to put it down. Sentences that contain 45 words? Please! It is fortu- nate the book has an index, otherwise I would not have known where (in Chapter Five) Dick Farley's \"discus- sion\" ended and Teets' anti-ufologist sermon began again. Another critical point I want to mention is Teets' statement that \"all hypnosis is self-hypnosis,\" as he claims \"we are taught early during our hypnotherapy training.\" (77) Teets also describes hypnosis as a form of passive mind control. I will leave the bulk of this argument for someone else to write about, but from experience and study, I can tell you that there is noth- ing passive about mind control, and nothing could be further from the truth than to claim \"all hypnosis is self-hypnosis.\" Different from self-hypnosis Being hypnotized by someone else is entirely dif- ferent from self-hypnosis. Teets is bordering on reck- lessness by making these accusations. The reason, how- ever, that I brought this up is because while searching for the \"stats\" on dissociation that Walter Bowart re- ferred to, I came across this strange comment again. Bowart is quoted in Teets' book as saying, \"Be sure you don't overlook the stats on the number of disso- ciative cases in [sic] among the 'abductees.' Tests that have been given indicate it to a high percentage. See Alien Discussions, the MIT thing...\" (92) While I searched for these statistics in my copy of Alien Discussions, I came across this comment by psy- chiatrist George Ganaway. \"At our center I've treated over 250 patients now over the past several years, and I have several colleagues who have treated many oth- ers. Since we don't know what causes dissociation, the most replicable finding is that they're all hypnotic vir- tuosos. All hypnosis is self-hypnosis, when it comes right down to it...\" [my emphasis] (Alien Discussions, pg 521; \"Therapist Panel: Helping The Abductees.\") Are psychiatrists (and journalists) really taught this \"mantra\" in hypnotherapy school—or did Teets dis- cover this little saying by reading Ganaway in Alien Discussions? Like Teets, I'm not an expert in hypno- sis, but I have read enough—and experienced enough— to know that all hypnosis is NOT self-hypnosis. This sounds like a convenient way to place the re- sponsibility for whatever memories that do surface— and any associated problems with those memories— squarely on the shoulders of the person being hypno- tized. This includes people remembering childhood sexual abuse and abductees. Many Accusations Teets makes a lot of accusations in his book. I will only touch on a few that I believe are the most impor- tant. Teets accuses Corso \"and others in government\" who are retired, of going public with their information because they \"... prefer to cash in on the current 'UFO rage,' rather than face civil rage after a Presidential release of information about past roles in Project Paperclip...\" (61) Two easily detectable flaws in Teets' logic is that public knowledge of Project Paperclip is not new and there has been, unfortunately, very little civil rage about it. Secondly, Colonel Corso is an old man. If Corso is becoming wealthy off of his book, he is not likely to live a long time to enjoy the fruits of his labor. In addition, if Colonel Corso was interested in mak- ing money, he would have begun decades ago with the alleged extraterrestrial technology he possessed. Per- haps an investigative journalist could look into Corso's past to at least see how many high-tech patents he holds. Bob Teets also accuses Whitley Strieber's and John Mack's writings of being so similar with cult leader Marshall Applewhite's that, \"It does, indeed, seem quite difficult at times to tell these men's writing apart.\" UFO prophets? He labels Mack, Strieber and other ufologists and researchers as \"UFO Prophets,\" and alleges that these prophets are \"making the rounds and making a lot of money.\" Since Teets is so concerned about who is making money off of UFOs, he should add his own name to his list of imaginary conspirators. One accusation by Teets that is sure to ruffle a few proverbial feathers is made in Chapter Five— The Grassroots: Highlights and Discussion: \"...joining the U.S. Air Force and CIA in opposing (and defusing)"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal January 1998 Page 17 Rockefeller's efforts were our long-present 'UFO in- vestigation' organizations, clearly tied to government through their memberships and leadership.\" The longest existing grassroots UFO investigative organization in the United States is MUFON, The Mutual UFO Network. Teets knows this as well as any- one involved in the investigation of UFOs and abduc- tions. Is Teets saying that MUFON, its board of direc- tors and its International Director, Mr. Walter Andrus, Jr., have been trying to defuse Laurence Rockefeller's efforts to encourage governmental openness regarding the UFO phenomenon? If Teets is indeed an \"award- winning\" journalist, where is his proof to back up this claim? On the Positive Side There are some positive mentions made in UFOs and Mental Health. One is the chapter on remote view- ing. After bashing David Morehouse (author of Psy- chic Warrior) we get a relatively positive spin on re- mote viewing. I suspect this is because the United States Govern- ment supported research into remote viewing for nearly 20 years and, as Teets states, \"Lyn [Buchanan] once gave me and a few other friends a long lecture about remote viewing, then allowed us to try it. We all scored quite well. And I must admit .I've often thought about taking Lyn's training.\" It is curious that Teets seems to have so much faith in remote viewing after only hav- ing one short experience with it. There are also new labels for abductees that can be gleaned from reading and purchasing the books Teets promotes in UFOs and Mental Health. A couple of examples are \"anomalously sensitive persons\" and \"in- formation virus\" syndrome. Two examples of books that are promoted are Virus of the Mind by Richard Brodie and Unmasking the Enemy, by Nelson Pacheco. A paraphrased quote by Teets from the latter fol- lows: \"If you want to do UFO research, one clear way is to follow the trail of bodies.\" Teets' good friend, William J. Baldwin, Ph.D. and the author of Spirit Releasement Therapy: A Technique Manual, is also promoted. Quoting Teets: \"One of the traits Baldwin sees in many of his clients, and which he writes about in his book, is a sort of possession of a human being by an interstitial extraterrestrial-type en- tity. Where it gets interesting is at the point where this extraterrestrial is found to itself be possessed by a clas- sic demon, or jinn.\" Where's Mulder when you need him? Bob Teets states in his Introduction, \"The UFO phenomenon...has very little to do with aliens and ex- otic space ships visiting earth and interacting with hu- mans...\" UFOs and Mental Health has very little to do with the subject of UFOs, and even less to do with mental health. American documents: What do they reveal/hide? By Gildas Bourdais Editor's Note: The following is the first part of an address at the Primero Forum Mundiai de Ufologia in Brazil, Dec. 7-14,1997. Due to length, it will be necessary to run it in segments. More than 30,000 pages of official documents on UFOs have been made public in the United States since 1977, in application of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). This is a large volume of documentation, which is not yet fully examined, and there is more to come, according to researchers like Barry Greenwood, one of the main pioneers in that field. Many of these documents are of limited value, but, thanks to the efforts of a number of researchers, sig- nificant documents have been selected and made eas- ily available for analysis, notably by the Fund for UFO Research, which offers a remarkable selection of about 600 pages (1). The official attitude, throughout the world, is still to deny, or at least to leave in doubt, the reality of UFOs. What do these documents reveal about them ? We should not be too impressed by this volume, which is small when compared with the enormous amount of classified documents. According to a senatorial commission on secrecy, led by Senator Moynihan, there are over 1.5 billion pages of government records over 25 years old still classified and unavailable to the public (2). How many more pages on UFOs and related subjects remain hid- den in that mountain? Two questions on the officials documents I propose to examine a short selection of signifi- cant official documents, released by the Air Force, the CIA, the FBI and other administrations, and to ask our- selves two simple questions: 1. Do they contain convincing proof that these ad- ministrations have been aware for a long time of the reality of UFOs, and therefore have been hiding it from the public? 2. Do they contain at least serious indications that some of these administrations were involved in highly secret operations, such as the retrieval of crashed UFOs? No doubt, the answer to the first question is yes, but it is still necessary to put that into light, especially for the media, since the policy of the U.S. Air Force remains today one of complete denial of the very ex- istence of UFOs. As for the second question, regarding the possibil- ity of very secret operations, it is still a hotly debated matter, even among ufologists who admit not only the reality of UFOs, but the existence of a policy of se-"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Page 18 January 1998 MUFON UFO Journal crecy about them. In the view of researchers like Barry Greenwood and Robert Todd, who have played a prominent part in the obtaining of documents under FOIA, and more re- cently Kent Jeffrey, who has become a skeptic on Roswell, the released documents prove, on the con- trary, that there is no deeper secret of the crashed UFO kind. It is true, as we are going to see, that several mili- tary documents of that time mentioned the absence of crash and debris. But for other researchers, such as Kevin Randle and Michael Swords, of the Center for UFO Studies, that is no solid proof, because such docu- ments (especially declassified documents!) would not reveal such very deep secrets. In fact, I am going to argue that they do suggest such a level of \"above top secret\" operations regarding UFOs. How deep the secrets? The opinion of Barry Greenwood is particularly interesting since he was the author, with Larry Fawcett, of the famous book Clear Intent, published in 1984, which exposed with great force the policy of secrecy about UFOs, based on the study of the official docu- ments released under FOIA. The second edition of the book, published in 1992, was renamed, more bluntly, The UFO Cover-UP. What the Government Won't Say (3). In their book, Fawcett and Greenwood are very af- firmative. They say in the preface: \"From the start, UFOs were a top secret matter; of this, there is no doubt.\" In order to illustrate that, they quote, among other documents, a formerly classified FBI memoran- dum, dated 31 January, 1949, sent to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. Lets quote it, too (Doc. 1): Office Memo: UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT Date: January 31, 1949 To: DIRECTOR, FBI From: SAC, SAN ANTONIO Subject: PROTECTION OF VITAL INSTALLA- TIONS BUREAU FILE #65-5830 CONFIDENTIAL (declassified 8/31/77) \"At recent weekly Intelligence Conferences of G- 2, ONI, OSI and F.B.I., in the Fourth Army Area, Of- ficers of G-2, Fourth Army, have discussed the matter of \"Unidentified Aircraft\" or \"Unidentified Aerial Phe- nomena,\" otherwise known as \"Flying Discs,\" \"Fly- ing Saucers,\" and \"Balls of Fire.\" This matter is con- sidered top secret by Intelligence Officers of both the Army and the Air Forces.\" Such are the first lines of this memorandum, which goes on describing observations made over Los Alamos and other sensitive installations. Among the 1,600 pages released by the FBI, many documents describe obser- vations of UFOs above nuclear installations. I have counted 80 pages on the Oak Ridge plant alone! This situation clearly justified a top secret classification. It is true that such a mention \"top secret\" does not necessarily mean secret operations of the crash retrieval kind. However, in the following pages of their book Clear Intent, Fawcett and Greenwood did present tes- timonies referring to such operations. For instance, they gave the anonymous testimony of a former member of Naval Intelligence about the recovery of a crashed UFO in the Pacific, in 1973 (pages 66 to 69). A highly unusual craft This man, who had a \"triple A\" security clearance, was shown a \"very highly unusual craft\" while he was on guard at the Great Lakes Naval Base in Chicago. The craft had a teardrop shape, a light bluish appear- ance, a razor sharp edge, and was sitting on a pedestal made of four wooden blocks. He was ordered by the officers present not to say a word about it. Apparently, it may have been a test before giving him an even higher security clearance. About two months later, he learned from a friend in San Diego that a craft of similar appearance had been shot down by a destroyer, recovered under about 350 feet of water in the Pacific, and brought by rail to Chicago. What can we make of such a story? In their book, Fawcett and Greenwood seem to consider it as cred- ible. They stress that the witness stands by his account, and has repeated it to resercher Leonard Stringfield. Since the Seventies, quite a number of testimonies like this have surfaced on UFO crash retrievals. Stringfield alone has published no less than seven re- ports with similar testimonies, but he has kept them all anonymous. And, of course, there are the hundreds of testimonies of the Roswell case, the controversial \"Ma- jestic 12\" documents, not to forget the many rumors about Groom Lake and Area 51. How credible is all this information? The risk of disinformation A number of these documents and testimonies, such as the Majestic 12 document released by William Moore in 1987, are now put in doubt, suspected of be- ing hoaxes or disinformation, so that the situation to- day is one of uncertainty and confusion. In fact, it was possibly the goal of some of these operations. This is the reason why the book of Colonel Corso, The Day After Roswell, published in July 1997, has to be considered very cautiously. On one hand, if Colo- nel Corso is not an incredible liar, his book, which tells how some Roswell materials were secretly exploited during the sixties by the Foreign Technology Division of the Army at the Pentagon, is a major breakthrough for ufology. However, a number of his claims seem very far fetched or just erroneous, and, to make mat- ters worse, he does not bring any convincing proof. So the basic question remains: what solid proofs do we have of the existence of deep secrets? More re-"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal January 1998 Page 19 cently, Greenwood has become very skeptical about deep secrecy. Here is what he wrote in his bulletin Just Cause, dated Sept., 1996 (4) (Doc 2): \"The original purpose of this newsletter was to update readers of Clear Intent on government secrecy developments and document releases on UFOs subse- quent to the book's publication. Due to the efforts of a small band of researchers, there is now a much clearer picture of what governments have done with the UFO phenomena. The number of documents obtained after Clear Intent appeared has more than doubled, though none of them can settle the controversy. Nothing has been seen in the paperwork to verify claims ofcrashed- saucer and UFO abduction advocates.\" Greenwood also warns us against disinformation and false documents in his issue dated March, 1997: \"Government documents must come from certifiable government sources endorsed in writing officially or from reliable public archives or institutes for us to con- sider accepting them as genuine historical papers.\" For this reason, I will discuss here only a small number of documents, mainly from the U.S. Air Force, the FBI and the CIA, which are all accepted as genu- ine by everybody. As we all know, the main case of UFO crash retrieval remains the Roswell case, although it is still very controversial, at least for some of the testimonies. I am going to discuss it briefly, more pre- cisely the official Air Force documents on Roswell. But before that, let's settle rapidly the first ques- tion, the basic question of the reality of UFOs, as it is acknowledged in the official documents. UFOs acknowledged No American official document has ever affirmed publicly that the UFOs are real, but this reality is im- plied dearly in many declassified documents now made public, so that they are practically equivalent to an open admission by the American government. To me, this is an important point, but for those who think that I am breaking an open door, let me just say a few words about the situation in France, where skepticism is a rule in the media. On the positive side, Jean-Jacques Velasco, the en- gineer responsible for inquiries on UFOs at the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES), which is a pub- lic administration like NASA, has openly admitted the reality of UFOs for many years now. But this has not prevented a number of skeptical ufologists such as so- ciologists Pierre Lagrange and Bertrand Meheust from continuing to question this reality in their writings and in the media, arguing in favor of \"psycho-sociologi- cal\" explanations. To give an idea of the very skeptical situation in France, I will quote from the recent book of Lagrange, called La rumeur de Roswell (5) (Doc 3), which has been well received and widely quoted in the media. The last sentence of the text on the back cover speaks for itself: \"The author...shows how the invention of flying saucers, and then of 'UFO crashes,' have become mod- ern legends which are not close to disappearing from the imaginative world of our contemporaries.\" I have to emphasize this because Lagrange enjoys a reputa- tion as a solid researcher in the United States, and prob- ably elsewhere. The prominent skeptic But for the French ufologists, he is the prominent skeptic, always listened to when the subject of UFOs comes out in the media. Here is one example of this phenomenon which has been extremely detrimental to ufology in France. We could read, for instance, in the popular television magazine Telerama of 14 Decem- ber, 1996 (6) (Doc 4), some quotations of Lagrange in an article which accused the X Files of carrying \"ex- tremist and sectarian views\" to innocent fans. \"Solid ties link the American extreme-right, the 'patriots' groups, for whom the government is the main target, and the UFO hunters (chasseurs d'ovnis). Tim McVeigh, one of the presumed authors of the attack in Oklahoma City, \"says that he had seen UFOs and be- lieves that he bears an implant under the skin,\" writes sociologist Lagrange in La rumeur de Roswell. \" A footnote of this article explains that \"Lagrange strips down the hoax of the Roswell autopsy and tells to what necessities correspond the invention of flying saucers.\" Please note the systematic blend between the question of the reality of UFOs and the more contro- versial questions of UFO crashes and abductions. This is exactly what I am trying not to do here. So, it is still necessary to clarify this question of the reality of UFOs. Next month in the Journal: Gen.

Which is fair enough. That's generally how re- viewing is done, and Kottmeyer and I have fundamen- tally different views of ufology, ufologists, and the UFO phenomenon. Inevitably, our respective treatments of the subject are not going to look much alike. I might also mention that I refer to him in passing, in a critical way, on page 32. The monograph, I should explain, deals, in much- condensed form, with issues considered at far greater length in the forthcoming second edition of my UFO Encyclopedia (to be published in two fat volumes by Omnigraphics, at approximately 1600 pages total length). I mention this because Kottmeyer takes me to task for not addressing certain matters in the monograph. Space constraints kept them out. They are dealt with in all their luxurious detail in the Encylopedici, to which I refer all who are curious to read the full story of how ufology has evolved over its by now long history. This said, let me take specific issue with a few of Kottmeyer's complaints. He says I neglect Aime Michel \"in favor of nostalgic sneers at Morris Jessup's uncon- vincing and dead fantastic ideas.\" I'm.not sure what a \"nostalgic sneer\" is, but Jessup is significant, in my judgment, as an important early theorizer about ancient astronauts, and as a representative of the Fortean tra- dition within ufology. True, Michel was the more interesting and persua- sive thinker, but his occasional writings on the ETH (as opposed to his work on the 1954 French wave and his related theory of orthoteny) have been forgotten and (sadly, perhaps) were little heeded even in their time. Not having unlimited space in which to explore all aspects, theories, and personalities, I focused on those individuals who in my judgment had in some way in- fluenced the ET discussion and moved it along. I deal with Keyhoe, as anybody would have to, but not with Barker, Binder, Fuller, and Girvan, whom Kottmeyer inexplicably portrays as influential ET hypothesizers. Wilkins, Fontes, and Stringf ield are discussed because of their promulgation of theories about UFO hostility. Hostility theories remain very much a part of current UFO theory and lore. Certainly, McDonald favored the ETH, but that's about all he did, and I am at a loss to understand why Kottmeyer thinks he was a major theorist about extrasolar visitation. McDonald was, first and foremost, a pragmatist who concentrated on investigation and documentation. He thought ET visitation was a likely explanation for the most puzzling UFO reports, but he did not live long enough to propose an ETH of his own. The subject is addressed only in the occasional brief aside in his papers. Beyond that, Kottmeyer fails to understand that my monograph is about what ufologists have thought about the UFO phenomenon, not what the larger public has thought about it. Yes, the American public was slow to link flying saucers to possible extraterrestrial visi- tors—I have written on that very subject (see the Evans/ Stacy anthology UFOs 1947-1997, pp. 69-77)—but ufologists were faster to get there, and in the mono- graph I explain why. Next to occultists and many debunkers, the best ufologists—right or wrong—are indeed \"rationalists and materialists,\" as anyone can determine for himself or herself by reading the best writing on the subject. And no, ufology is not demonology by another name, though I gather Kottmeyer would have us em- brace such a grotesque oversimplication. I write of Keel's influence, but also of Vallee's. Whatever his faults, Vallee is not a demonologist, and he has been at least as influential as Keel in the (to me wrong-headed) effort to fuse ufology with occultism. Even so, most who follow Keel aren't demonologists, either. They just haven't read him as carefully as I have. The point I was attempting to make in the monograph is that Keel is a self-identified demonologist. Those who take him seriously ought to know that. If you aren't paying close attention, you'll miss the vastness of the distance between Keel and ra- tional discourse. It is my observation, as a longtime Keel watcher, that Keel's true views are poorly understood by those who consider him a responsible voice in the discus- sion about the nature and origin of UFO, anomalous, and paranormal phenomena. In the monograph I trace, for the first time anywhere as far as I know, the roots of Keel's demonologist-ufology in the otherwise ne- glected writings of such early saucer-era occultist speculators as Layne and Constable.

Jupiter, the lower of the two, sets less than 1-1/2 hours after the Sun on Feb. 1 and after the 1 st week fades into the so- lar glare. Mars stays visible longer (though incon- spicuous), setting about 1-1/2 hours after sunset throughout the month. It lies very close to a thin cres- cent Moon on the 27th. Saturn (0.6), in Pisces, lies low in the SW at dusk and later sets in the W soon after 9 p.m. The ringed gi- ant can be seen very near a lunar crescent on Feb. 1. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus rises after 4 a.m. in mid-month and dazzles the eye in the SE. The planet achieves maximum bril- liancy on the 19th at magnitude -4.6. Our gleaming neighbor in space pairs up with the crescent Moon on Feb. 23. Total Solar Eclipse: On Feb. 26, as the new moon crosses the face of the Sun, observers within a narrow strip of the Earth's surface will experience the awesome splendor of a total eclipse. This zone (only 94 miles wide at most) begins in the eastern Pacific near the equator and ex- tends northeastward to northern Colombia and Venezuela, across the southern Caribbean, and ends in the North Atlantic near Africa. Maximum totality is about 4 minutes. A partial eclipse of varying degrees will be seen in the U.S., weather permitting, below a line running from extreme southern California through the middle of Kansas to northern Michigan. Percentages of the Sun's diameter covered and local times of maximum eclipse follow for some samples cities: Atlanta, 25% at 1:54 p.m.; Chicago, 5% at 12:20; Houston, 21.5% at 12:22; Miami, 50% at 2:15; New York, 22% at 2:08; Tucson, 5% at 10:20 a.m.; Washington, 22.5% at 2:05 p.m. The closer one is to the path of totality, the more obscured the Sun becomes. Warning! Do not look at any fraction of the partially eclipsed Sun with the naked eye. Use ei- ther a #14 welder's filter in front of the eye, or project the Sun's image through a telescope or binocular eye piece onto a white surface such as a sheet of paper or cardboard. Those who happen to be within the totality path can safely view the to- tally eclipsed Sun with the unaided eye.

NEWSDAY After straining for decades to find hints of intelligent life in space, astronomers now suspect their big radio receivers have been tuned in wrong all along. Recently, research has shown radio signals from afar suffer fading and distortion as they pass through the long reaches of space. But the systems designed to listen for alien radio signals - called SETI, or Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence - were set up under the assumption any signal coming from another civilization would be a continued or repeating signal. This could mean the current SETI programs al- ready have recorded real messages, without recogniz- ing them, said researchers James Cordes, Joseph Lazio and the late Carl Sagan, all of Cornell University. The scientists' conclusions appeared in a research report published recently in the Astrophysical Journal. Over the years, SETI programs have recorded a few intriguing signals that seemed to meet all the cri- teria except one, the report said. The missing criterion was repeatability; the signals never were detected again, despite intensive listening.

It is imperative that the reports have been properly investigated at the source by the Field Investigator and the pertinent information se- cured from the witness. Coniiinied on Page 23"}]
