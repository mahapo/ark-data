This was the first book ever to present a state's UFO history. Tects, I realized, had uncovered an unfilled niche in the UFO literature. I have been a California-based UFO investigator for almost seventeen years. After investigating hundreds of UFO cases across the state, and writing four UFO books, I decided that I was finally ready. I am now pleased to announce that UFOs Over California: A True History of Extraterrestrial Encounters in the Go/den State has just been released by Schiffer Publishing. [See review in this issue.] California has several unique features that make it stand out from other states. First, it is the most crowded state, with an estimated population of 40 million. It is also the nation's wealthiest state, and is a leader in aerospace and defense, computer technology, oil production, lumber, agriculture, entertainment, and tourism. California is the leading producer of UFO reports in the United States. In 1977 J. Allen Hynek conducted a study of all the unidentified Blue Book cases. California headed the list with fifty-one cases, or 9.9% of the total number of U.S. reports. More recently, in 2003, the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) listed more than 2800 California UFO reports, nearly twice the number of the second leading state of Washington, and nearly three times the third leading state of Texas. For whatever reason, UFOs find California very attractive. With its rich UFO history, it is not surprising that California has had a strong influence in the evolution of ufology. After having studied several thousand Golden State encounters, I have come APRIL 2005 Number 14: The Camarillo sighting. up with a top twenty list of what are in my opinion among California's most sig- nificant and influential UFO events. Some of the cases are well known, oth- ers are probably obscure except to UFO researchers. Each one, however, represents an important chapter in not only California's UFO history, but in that of the world. Each has added to our knowledge or understanding of UFOs, has changed the way we view UFOs, or has contributed to the popularization of the subject. Here are California's top twenty UFO cases. Each of the cases has been sum- marized because of space consider- ations. MUFON UFO JOURNAL Number twenty: The Cisco Grove robot encounter On Labor Day weekend in 1965, three hunters in Cisco Grove had a unique encounter with a UFO and its occupants. It may be the earliest au- thenticated California case involving a robotic UFO occupant. The main witness, Donald Smythe, became separated from his two com- panions after a long day of hunting and became lost. When he saw a light dart- ing back and forth above him, he as- sumed a helicopter had been sent to rescue him. Instead, the object swooped down and hovered silently overhead. Smythe realized it was a UFO and took refuge"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"in a nearby tree. At this point, three fig- ures exited the craft. Two figures were five feet tall and dressed in silvery-gray material. The third figure appeared to be robotic. Then followed an all-night-long or- deal in which the UFO occupants re- mained at the bottom of the tree, send- ing up clouds of noxious fumes. Smythe lost consciousness several times, and im the morning the figures and craft were gone. Smythe's story was not without cor- roboration. Upon re-uniting with his friends, one of the hunters revealed that he also saw a \"bright, large light\" swoop down at low altitude and dart across the sky. All three also remarked on the coin- cidence that the government was already in the area looking for an alleged \"me- teorite.\" Finally, Smythe's wife saw him immediately after the incident and con- firmed that Smythe was badly trauma- tized and covered with scratches. Smythe reported his case to the Air Force, which suggested that he was the victim of a prank. The case electrified the UFO com- munity. Coral Lorenzen calls it, \"The most spectacular report I have ever ex- amined.\" Ted Bloecher and Paul Cerny also conducted an onsite investigation. Writes Cerny, \"There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that this incident is factual and authentic.\" Number nineteen: Ronald Reagan sees UFO California is home to many celebri- ties, and it was only a matter of time before some of them came forward with their accounts of seeing a UFO. Today, many have come forth, includ- ing Sammy Davis Jr., Chad Everett, Jill Ireland, Cliff Robertson, and others. Among the most prominent of these is President Ronald Reagan. The sight- ing occurred when he was governor of California. Says Reagan's pilot, Bill Paynter, \"We were near Bakersfield when Governor Reagan and the others called my atten- tion to a big light flying a bit behind my plane. It appeared to be several hun- dred yards away.\" As they watched, the mysterious ob- ject quickly accelerated and disappeared in the distance. Reagan later confirmed the details to Wa// Street Journal reporter Norman Miller. While Reagan never publicly dis- cussed his sighting, it may have been the spark that ignited his interest in the sub- ject. On several occasions, he made enigmatic statements that seemed to reveal his strong interest in UFOs- quotes that are now famous in UFO history. Said Reagan in 1985, \"If suddenly there were a threat to this world from some other species from another planet, we'd forget all the litde local differences that we have between our two countries, and we would find out once and for all that we really are all human beings on the Earth together.\" Number eighteen: The Bluff Creek encounter Some of the many odd patterns of UFO behavior are typified in the fol- lowing extensive encounter which be- gan in early April, 1953. The two main witnesses, John Black and John Van Allen, were working at their titanium mine outside of Bluff Creek when they both separately ob- served a \"metallic saucer\" hovering over the area of the mine. Over the next few weeks, the object returned on four occasions. Then, on April 20, Black observed the craft from a distance of only a quarter mile. It was now obvious to the men that the UFO was very interested in their mine. Exactly one month later, on May 20, Black returned to the mine and saw the now familiar saucer hovering only a few hundred feet high. It quickly took off and disappeared. Black approached the area where it had hovered and found several small five-inch footprints. Then exactly one month later, again on June 20, Black was outside the mine when he saw what he thought was a small child with a bucket. Upon approach, however, he saw that the large saucer had landed on a nearby sandbar. He examined the figure and realized it wasn't a child, but instead appeared to be an unusual-looking small man wearing unusual clothes and carrying a cone-shaped bucket. The small man heard Black approach and quickly ran into the saucer, which promptly took off. And so began one of the strangest chapters in UFO history. Black alerted the local sheriff, and the story was some- how leaked to the press. Because the saucer had appeared on schedule three months in a row, everyone was predict- ing a July 20 landing. More than 200 people arrived on the scene, including local residents, news- paper reporters, cameramen, and sau- cer enthusiasts. Snack bars and chairs were set up as if the event were a circus performance. Unfortunately, the UFO never showed up, and the Brush Creek ordeal came to a sudden end. The case was investigated by several major researchers, including Gray Barker and Paul Spade, both of whom were actually jailed by the Brush Creek Sheriff's station when they tried to con- duct a stakeout for the saucer. Today the case is considered a classic in UFO history. Number seventeen: pilot's near-miss with UFO On April 14, 1954, United Airlines Flight 193 was forced to make an emer- gency landing after a near-miss with a UFO over the city of Long Beach. Says Capt. Schidel, \"It appeared so suddenly, it was as if it was flying dark and had just turned its navigation lights on.. .it was in sight just two seconds and made no movement to avoid me.\" To avoid the object, Capt. Schidel was forced to maneuver the jet into a sud- den steep climbing turn. The emer- gency turn caused havoc in the passen- ger cabin. One passenger was thrown from his seat and broke his left leg. A steward- ess lost her balance and fractured her ankle. According to researcher Donald Keyhoe, \"Air force intelligence moved quickly to keep the story quiet.\" Nev- ertheless, the press found out, and the case became a media sensation. The captain's sterling reputation, the fact that people were injured as a result of the encounter, and the fact that the mysterious aircraft was not in touch with any airport control towers all combined to give the case a high level of credibil- ity- Today the case is considered a clas- sic in the annals of airplane-UFO en- counters. l MUFON UFO Journal APRIL 2005"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Sixteen: The case of Melinda Leslie There are an estimated thousand or more recorded UFO abducdons com- ing from California. Office manager, Melinda Leslie is like most abductees. She experienced early childhood visi- tations, and has been abducted regularly throughout her life. However, at first she was unaware that she was an abductee. She became suddenly interested in UFOs in 1987 after visidng Area 51. Then, examining her past, she slowly realized that she had been having expe- riences her whole life. A missing time encounter in 1989 erased any denials that she was an abductee. Since then, she has experienced the entire range of UFO phenomenon, in- cluding medical examinations, emo- tional testing, baby presentations, warn- ings of future disasters, and harassment from what appears to be the U.S. mili- tary. In July, 1991, Leslie and two friends experienced an abduction while driving along the remote Angeles Crest High- way outside Los Angeles. All three wit- nesses had full or partial recall of the onboard segment and were able to cor- roborate each other's accounts, making it one of the few multiple witness ab- ductions on record. She has also had many other con- scious encounters, and has explored many of her memories with hypnotic regression. While Leslie's case is among the most extensive and complicated of all re- corded California abductees, it is other- wise pretty typical. Melinda Leslie, however, is different from most other abductees in one par- ticular way: she has gone public with her experiences. In fact, she is one of California's best known abductees, and has remained a permanent fixture on the lecture and media circuit. In talking about her experiences and publicizing the abduction phenomenon, she has contributed greatiy to public education of the subject. Her willingness and ability to inter- act with all aspects of the public media has helped many people gain a better understanding of what it means to be a UFO abductee. Fifteen: The case of Morgana Van Klausen The Morgana Van Klausen (pseud- onym) case is well known among south- ern California investigators. In most respects, the case is typical. Starting in December, 1986, the mother and son began experiencing regular visitations by gray-type ETs in their southern California home. The husband was skeptical at first, until he too received a visitation. In the next two decades, the Van Klausens experienced numerous close- up sightings and missing-time encoun- ters. What makes the case so compel- ling, however, is the physical evidence. Besides multiple witness testimony and landing trace evidence, on one oc- casion Morgana Van Klausen was healed as the result of a UFO encoun- ter. It is this that makes the case unique. As revealed by investigator Bill Hamilton, Van Klausen was diagnosed with a \"non-cystic mass\" in her left breast. The evening before she was to have the tumor removed, Van Klausen experienced a visitation. She went to the hospital the next day and was shocked to find that all traces of the tumor had disappeared. Writes Hamilton, \"Both the radiologist and the surgeon confirmed that the previous diagnosis had revealed a solid mass, and that solid masses just don't disappear.\" Hamilton has obtained the before and after X-rays. This kind of medical evidence is very rare, and makes this case outstanding in terms of proof of UFO reality. Fourteen: The Camarillo sightings In late November and early Decem- ber of 1996, a UFO appeared over the city of Camarillo for six consecutive days. The first sightings took place on Nov. 28 and 29. Local Ventura MUFON investigators heard about the initial sightings, and knowing that UFOs often appear on consecutive days, they quickly organized an on-site investigation. On Dec. 2, MUFON field investiga- tor Alice Leavy arrived on site with sev- eral other investigators. To their amaze- ment, the UFO showed up right on .schedule. The researchers clearly ob- served a \"small spherical object\" hov- ering in place. As they observed with binoculars and filmed with video camera and still cam- eras, the object turned red and ejected a smaller object. The larger object then broke up into several smaller objects which prompdy disappeared. Throughout the entire ordeal, the witnesses continued to maintain detailed photographic records. While the video camera didn't have the resolution to cap- ture the object, the telephoto still pho- tos did. Whitiey Strieber calls the case \"one of the best documented sightings in re- cent United States history.. .1 have seen some of the still photos and can verify their remarkable combination of clar- ity and impossibility. Being that the object's actions were witnessed by a half- dozen witnesses, both through binocu- lars and the naked eye, it is hard to main- tain a case that they are anything but unexplained.\" What makes this case unique and important is the fact that several MUFON investigators converged on the scene and not only had sightings themselves, but obtained comprehen- sive photographic evidence. This may be the only case of its kind in Califor- nia history. Number thirteen: The LAX sightings The Los Angeles Airport is one of the largest and busiest airports in the entire world, shuttling millions of people across the globe. Unknown to many people, it is also the location of an on-going series of UFO encounters. While UFO-airport encounters are not uncommon in the literature, the LAX sightings are particularly dramatic and consistent. They began in the early 1950s and continue to the present day. The first recorded sighting was on July 15,1952. For four days, dozens of witnesses observed UFOs approach to within a quarter mile of the control tow- ers. Other dramatic sightings continued on a regular basis, including 1966,1973, 1992,1995,1997, 2002, and 2003. The sightings involve dozens of witnesses, including MUFON investigator Mark Hunziker, videotape footage, and pos- sible radar evidence. The 1992 sighting was printed in the usually skeptical magazine Aviation Week and Space Technology, which said.in part, \"The pilot and co-pilot.. .said they saw APRIL 2005 MUFON UFO JOURNAL"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"an unusual aircraft coming directly at them and pass under the 747 by an esti- mated 500-1000 feet...the several sec- ond sighting gave the crew the impres- sion that the other aircraft was a lifting- body configuration, and they described it as looking like the forward fuselage of a Lockheed SR-17....Defense De- partment and Air Force officials said last week that it was not one of their secret projects.\" The LAX encounters show that UFOs display a strong interest in our aviation technology, can easily evade our fastest aircraft, and sometimes have little fear of being observed. The conclusion is undeniable: California's largest airport is under ex- traterrestrial surveillance. This fact alone should give rise to serious con- cerns in regards to airport security. Number twelve: An underwater UFO base? While the majority of UFOs are seen either flying in the sky or landed on the ground, a small portion of accounts in- volve ocean-going UFOs. Sometimes these craft are seen to actually enter or emerge from the ocean itself. Underwater UFOs are relatively rare, except for one location-a small stretch of coastline off southern California known as the Santa Catalina Channel. North from Santa Barbara down south to Long Beach, the waters seem to be thick with UFOs. •In fact, this section of coastline has produced dozens of cases. The sightings reach back to the 1940s and continue to the present day. The first reported California under- water UFO was on July 7, 1947, when two San Raphael teenagers saw a \"flat glistening object\" emerge from the wa- ter, fly around, and then dive back into the water 400 yards from shore. Throughout this same year, numer- ous steamers reported a mysterious \"un- dersea mountain\" or a \"large mass un- derwater\" which kept appearing and dis- appearing in various locations in the San Francisco Bay and down the coast. Following this, the sightings came regularly, in 1951, 1954, 1955, 1957, 1962, 1964, 1970, 1980, 1990, 1991, 1993,2004.. .the list goes on, most from the Santa Catalina channel. The sightings involve many highly credible witnesses, including lifeguards, security guards, law enforcement offi- cials, military officers, and countless citi- zens. Numerous southern California- based investigators have uncovered sightings from this area, including Bill Hamilton, Yvonne Smith, Ann Druffel, myself, and others. Writes Ann Druffel, \"The area has for at least thirty years been the scene of UFO reports of all kinds-surface sightings of hazy craft which cruise lei- surely in full view of military installa- tions, aerial spheres bobbing in oscillat- ing flight, gigantic cloud-cigars, and at least one report of an underwater UFO with uniformed occupants.\" While several theories have been raised to account for this high concen- tration of reports, the most popular is that there is some type of underwater UFO base off the California coast. In any case, the area is one of California's most active UFO hotspots. [Continued next month.] Invisibility shields planned by engineers By James Owen for National Geographic News In popular science fiction, the power of invisibility is readily apparent. Star Trek fans, for example, know that the devious Romulans could make their spaceships suddenly disappear. But is the idea really so implausible? Not according to new findings by sci- entists who say they have come up with a way to create a cloaking device. Electronic engineers at the Univer- sity of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia are researching a device they say could make objects \"nearly invisible to an observer.\" The contrivance works by prevent- ing light from bouncing off the surface of an object, causing the object to ap- pear so small it all but disappears. The concept was reported by the sci- ence news website news@nature.com. It says the proposed cloaking device would not require any peripheral attach- ments (such as antennas or computer networks) and would reduce visibility no matter what angle at which an object is viewed. The concept is based on a \"plasmonic cover,\" which is a means to prevent light from scattering. (It is light bouncing off an object that makes it visible to an ob- server). The cover would stop light from scat- tering by resonating at the same fre- quency as the light strikmg it. If such a device could cope with different wave- lengths of electromagnetic radiation (in- cluding visible light), in theory, the ob- ject would vanish into thin air. Alu and Engheta investigated experi- mental plasmonic covers that incorpo- rated metals, such as gold and silver, to hide visible light. When light strikes a metallic mate- rial, waves of electrons, called plasmons, MUFON UFO Journal are generated. The engineers found that when the frequency of the light striking the material matched the frequency of the plasmons, the two frequencies act to cancel each other out. Under such conditions, the metallic object scattered only negligible amounts of light. The researchers' studies show that spherical and cylindrical objects coated with plasmonic shielding material pro- duce very little light scattering. These objects, when hit by the right wavelength of light, were seen to be- come so small that they were almost invisible. The study is supported by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which researches and develops cutting edge military technology. Some experts note, however, that cloaking devices that could enable mili- tary vehicles and aircraft, let alone space- ships, to become completely invisible to the enemy are likely to remain elusive for the foreseeable future. John Pendry, the Imperial College physicist, said that light-shielding cov- ers would have to be customized to match the properties of each and every object they hide. It would be still more difficult to de- vise shields that could cope with all wavelengths of the visible spectrum— from red to violet light-and not just a single color. Types of invisibility shielding previ- ously proposed by scientists depend on advanced camouflage systems, rather than objects being made to look undetectably tiny. Such systems involve light sensors that create a mirror image of the back- ground scene on the viewed side of the concealed object. APRIL 2005"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"What's new with alien implants? By Dr. Roger Leir W hat's new? This is the ques- tion I have been asked more than any other. The answer is more complex than one might imag- ine. Since my first venture into perform- ing surgery for the removal of strange objects from those individuals who al- lege alien abduction in 1995, my life has changed dramatically. I have found there is not enough time in the day to continue a full-time medi- cal practice, tend to problems of my aging body, raise a 14-year-old daugh- ter, have some sort of a personal life, and manage to do research in the field of alien implants. Despite this, I have continued as a podiatric surgeon and to collect physi- cal evidence in the alien abduction phe- nomena. To date we have performed 11 sur- geries for the removal of objects from alleged abductees. These 11 surgeries have netted 12 objects, one of which had no scientific merit. The others have all undergone analy- sis by a myriad of well-known labora- tories, and the results have been quite mind-blowing. It should be understood that at this point the laboratory research is incomplete. There is much more that can be learned from these objects if further tests were performed. Why has this work not been done? The answer is simple. There are not enough funds to approach the labora- tories directly and have them do the work. I have refused to do so-called \"backdoor research.\" I am grateful for what has been done so far on our shoestring budget. I have formed a legal entity, A&S Research, which is a 501 (C 3) non-profit entity, in hopes that grants and donations would be forthcoming. Sadly to say, so far this has not been the case. Most of my research has been paid from my own pocket and -from a few donations, coupled with the money I have earned from the entertainment in- dustry by licensing and appearing in tele- vision productions. Also the sale of my books and DVD's has helped. What's new? In addition to the surgi- APRIL 2005 Dr. Roger Leir cal samples we have removed for scien- tific study, we have now accepted some additional samples from outside sources, which are reliable and have, a detailed chain of evidence. One specimen is from our own or- ganization, MUFON. These samples are now also out for analyses, and I wait with great patience as the wheels of laboratory re- search grind away, with expectations the results will be forthcoming shortly. How does all this stand with the UFO community in general? Inter- estingly enough, most seem over- joyed when I can produce data showing scientific anomalies. However there are certain percent- ages who are extremely upset when they read mundane findings. I really doubt if there is a scientific researcher in any field who comes up with a record of all anomalous data. Looking at the past findings on the metallic samples, one of the most im- portant anomalies involves magnetic properties of iron metals, which on x- ray diffraction show the iron to be amor- phous. It has been shown to me by a small number of scientists working in the so- called \"secret military science field\" that we do not have the knowledge to re- produce these magnetic amorphous metals. In addition, when we find non-ter- restrial isotopic ratios in objects com- ing from people who allege alien abduc- tion suggests these individuals are tell- ing the truth about their experiences. I could go on and on illustrating the un- usual physical and chemical anomalies we have found so far. Still there are those who sit in their comfortable chairs at home and hop on the Internet to criticize me for not hav- ing my articles peer reviewed. This is a valid criticism, but if those who render such criticism do not offer a methodol- ogy for getting this done, then perhaps MUFON UFO JOURNAL they should refrain from their discour- aging, non-productive remarks. It is certainly not due to lack of ef- fort, as I have diligently worked toward that very end. A sterling example might be the research performed on the Gary Lowery \"claw\" sample. Working with one of the world's lead- ing geneticists and the National Insti- tute for Discovery Science, we moved to within a few short days of getting a peer-reviewed article printed in a genetic journal. Fortunately for us, a last-minute newly-designed genetic replication pro- cedure produced data that proved the \"claw\" was not a claw at all, but rather a slug. The story does not end there, but the point is that the article never ap- peared in any peer-reviewed journal. Does that mean the research en- deavor was futile? I think not, since out of the fires of this project a new proce- dure was developed, leading to further revelations in the DNA research arena. Does that mean there is no data prov- ing the specimen occurred as a result of alien abduction? Again, the answer is an emphatic NO. What we eventually found, because of this (non-peer-re- viewed) research study, which by the way was the most extensive study done so far for DNA related to the abduction phenomena, were more questions, such as: How did a Sea Slug get into Gary's closet? How did a slug from the New Zealand area get to Bakersfield, CA? How did this particular animal trans- form into such a petrified state that it could only be cut with a sharp scalpel blade? What's new? A small portion of this animal is now in the hands of a Cana- dian scientific laboratory. We are trying to determine the age of the animal by carbon dating. What a surprise it would be if this animal were a thousand or more years old. Would this answer any of the posed questions? Again, the answer would be NO. Others and myself have come to the conclusion that this is the way re- search in ufology goes. Try and solve one problem and you wind up with three"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"more things to question. This seems to be the nature of the beast. What else is new? One of the few ways we have had to collect funds to continue this research is to use the en- tertainment industry, or, better yet, I might say, having the entertainment in- dustry use me. Nevertheless, it does generate some tangible income through licensing and on-camera appearances. There is a price that one must pay to be able to do this. Two examples of this are as follows: Within the past few months a local Hollywood production company de- cided to do a story on the alien abduc- tion subject called the \"Gray Agenda,\" which aired a few months ago on the History Channel. . One of the producers of this piece was none other than one of our own, upcoming young UFO researcher John Greenewald, who also served as the master of ceremonies at the MUFON Symposium 2004. I was initially asked to participate in the show, but because of their \"budget constraints\" they withdrew their inter- est in my work. After the show aired I was relieved I had not done the program, as it turned out to be one of the most insulting and destructive television pieces on this sub- ject I have ever witnessed. There was not the slightest mention of our MUFON organization in the entire show. Instead, there was a tribute to \"The Houston UFO Network.\" I was ap- palled, and contacted John. His only comment was that he had litde to .do with the program content, and was try- Implant removal. ing a new career in television produc- tion. I wished him a lot of luck in his new endeavor. Same subject—another TV program called \"Proof.Positive\" produced by another Southern California production company by the name of Cosgrove- Muir Productions. I was approached and asked to par- ticipate in this program because of a piece of material in my possession, which was suspected of having come from a New Mexico UFO crash site in 1947. Several individuals and myself held a press conference in Roswell in 1997, the 50 th anniversary of the Roswell crash. During this press conclave we showed the material and the related sci- entific data. I agreed to do the show, and was impressed with the quality of the endeavor. They even flew Jesse Marcel, Jr. into Los Angeles to film him saying the ma- terial looked like something he had seen on his kitchen floor in 1947. Neither I nor any of the other participants were told during the shooting of this program there would be any conclusions drawn at the end of the program. As it turned out, they decided to have three episodes, each a different story, in a one-hour segment, and at the end would deem each story Proof Positive, Proof Negative or Proof Undeter- mined. Naturally, they determined my material to be Proof Negative. Prior to shooting the program I was instructed to take the sample to a lapi- dary and have a small rectangular piece cut away from the specimen. I followed their instructions and presented this MUFON UFO Journal sample to the producer who in turn took it to a laboratory at UCLA. There, a learned professor performed a SIMS Isotopic Ratio Study on the sample. His conclusion was that the sample was nothing more than a piece of ordinary silicon, used widely in the computer chip industry. This really mys- tified me because at least four other pre- vious laboratories had results showing non-terrestrial isotopic ratios. After the program aired I was able to find the name of the UCLA profes- sor who did the test and contacted him. He was a bit defensive, and I told him I did not question his integrity or his abili- ties. He told me he hoped I was not upset because he had taken only a small tip from the sample to do the analysis. I found this confusing and asked him what he meant by, \"the tip.\" His answer was that he removed the tip of the tri- angular piece I had sent him. I was flab- bergasted because the specimen I had cut and given to the producer was a pre- cise rectangle. This solved the mystery of the pre- sented result. The pieces were switched by the production team. I notified my agent about this, and he in-turn con- tacted one of the producers of-the show. Her comment was, \"I couldn't care less.\" Now, was this all bad? No, because the funds derived from the program went to pay for analysis of several other specimens. So goes the battle for knowl- edge and truth in ufology. What else is new? One more item hot off the presses. I am currently enter- taining the idea of starting a world class alien abduction institute here on the West Coast. This would be a facility where these phenomena could be studied with all the scientific minds and \"material necessary to do the job. I have discussed this with several individuals, including Budd Hopkins, and they were enthused. In order to raise money to fund this project, others and myself have formed our own Film Production Company. We intend to produce a major motion pic- ture on the subject of ufology with all its strange ramifications. Initially we are in the process of pro- ducing a 15-minute teaser for the pur- poses of selling the entire project. If any of our readers know investors who would be interested in contributing to this project, please contact me through the .journal. APRIL 2005"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Part 2 History of UFO sightings in Turkey Esen Sekerkarar By Esen Sekerkarar MUFON Representative, Turkey I n July, 2001, we were most amazed to receive an official re- port of a UFO sighting signed by Halil .Isik,/ goyerner of Adiyaman. This was the first rime in Turk- ish history. In the •' report were the details of the sighting, as well as testimonies of the witnesses, who are three ru- ral guards and seven gendarme patrols. At 10 PM the three rural guards (Fevzi Cebe, Ybrahim Yilmaz, Yusuf Yilmaz) on duty near Dandirmaz vil- lage of the town Tut in the city of Adiyaman, saw a round object taking off from the ground. They immediately called their supe- riors on the radio. Seven gendarme pa- trols (Murat Bilgin, Hakan Unal, Murat Baltaci, Tamer Aydin, Serkan Ozmen, Adem Suleymanoglu, Murat Karan) also viewed the object with night binoculars. As they later described in their testi- monies, the object that resembled a large tray was glowing in the sky, and was as big as a house. The bottommost part of the subject resembled a saucer. The upper part was stationary, yet the bottom was spinning. It was emitting red and yellow lights through its window openings. After a while, it flew towards Ulubat Mountain and disappeared. Next morning, the incident was re- ported to the governor of the town Halil Isik. He immediately called the ten wit- nesses and put them into ten separate rooms and asked them to write a report of what they saw, with a sketch of the sighted object. The testimonies show that they all saw the same thing and their drawings are identical as well.  '• Here is the translation of the origi- nal testimony of rural guard Fevzi Cebe, son of Mustafa, born in 1958. APRIL 2005 \"QUESTION: What have you ob- served and:what information do you have about the Unidentified Aerial Ob- ject sighted on the night of June 7,2001? . ANSWER: \"I have been at service as a Temporary Rural Guard for Tut Town Gendarme Headquarters for eight years. I often go on [patrolling] missions. \"In daytime, we-went on the Masuf Peak, which is in the east of Tut Town, between Dagyalangoz Village and Dandirmaz Village. We were on watch and ambush duty. \"On June 7, 2001, at about 21:30- 22:00, (9:30-10:00 PM) we were again on watch duty along with 10 people from Tut Town Gendarme Headquar- ters. It was dark, the full moon was young, providing some illumination; the .weather was cloudless and moistless. There were no winds. We were at a quite high elevation. \"Right at that moment Gendarme Corporal Hakan Unal approached from 30 meters east to Senior Gendarme Ser- geant Murat Bilgin, whom we were to- gether with, and said, 'Commander, look there to the north. A light is ascending from there.' \"So I looked at the same direction and there was a dome-shaped object with a halo around it in the north, 50- 100 m. above Komurtepe, which stands 3 km. opposite us. \"This object was sometimes station- ary and sometimes moving towards the east by pausing [hovering] in every 50- 100 meters. Senior Gendarme Sergeant Murat Bilgin saw the same thing. \"He was looking through his night binoculars, and he couldn't hide his as- tonishment. \"He was both watching and remark- ing that he had never seen anything like that. I was very curious too, so he gave me the binoculars to observe. \"When I looked through the binocu- lars, I saw an'object as big as a one- floored village house as described above. The bottom part of the object was like a ball, and there were aligned windows around the sphere similar to plane win- dows. \"A stronger light was emanating from MUFON UFO JOURNAL them. I couldn't count how many win- dows there were as it was far. While the dome part of the object was stationary, the bottom part was revolving around itself. \"It went about 5 km. to the east and landed on Ulu Baba summit, which is close to Adyyaman; I am sure that was the place, as I know the area very well. When it was about to land, its lights went off completely. \"We kept watching that area. About 15 minutes later, the object started to give off light at where it had landed. As I looked through the night binoculars again, I saw the same object I had seen before, but [this time] on 300 m. left of the object and on the three sides of its back part there were flashing lights in different colors like the turn indicators of a car. \"We could not determine what these lights were. This luminous object stayed for about 45-50 minutes on Ulu Baba's tomb. 15 minutes after the landing, it turned its lights on and waited for 30 minutes in the same position, then first ascended towards Adiyaman direction and later went away fast. \"The flashing lights vanished after the object took off. We waited until the morning, but did not see anything simi- lar to what we had seen.\" After realizing the seriousness of the sighting, Governor Halil Isik decided to report this incident to the Ministry of Interior Affairs. The same report was also sent to the Turkish Scientific and Technical Research Committee (TUBITAK)onJuly3, 2001. Police footage UFOs were seen again for two nights on Jan. 26-27,2002, over the same town. At around 11 PM on Jan. 26 the police headquarters in Adiyaman received a phone call reporting a brilliant object over the eastern part of the city. The police contacted the patrolmen who were on duty in that area, and they confirmed that there was a brilliant ob- ject in the sky. The chief of police was immediately notified of the extraordinary incident, and a police team was sent to the area."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Police officers, equipped with night cameras, spotted the object spreading out colorful lights and rotating around its axis, and managed to film it for about five hours! The following night, at about 2:15 AM, two flying objects similar to the one sighted the night before were observed in the skies of Adiyaman, this time over the western part of the city. The objects were also detected and filmed uninterruptedly by the watch guard of the Security Headquarters be- tween 2:29-3:00 AM from the roof of die police station. According to the information given by Governor Isik, a total of five uni- dentified objects were observed over Adiyaman: two over Kahta and Samsat districts and three over Besni and Golbasi. Isik stated that more than 20 police officers witnessed these incidents, and the images of the objects shot by police cameras were sent to the authorities. This news was all over the national papers for days. However, the Ministry of Interior Affairs never made any pub- lic releases about these incidents. Side by side flight for 15 minutes It is not very common to see the sto- ries of pilots' UFO observations in Turkish papers. So it was a big surprise to see a picture of a Turkish Airlines (THY) pilot, Selahattin Sivri, telling the full story of the encounter he had along with two other members of the crew on Oct. 27, 1989. Pilot Sivri, who had an experience of 24 years in his career at the time, stated, \"We were flying at the altitude of 11,000 feet. All of a sudden, along with two colleagues, I saw a giant egg-shaped object as high as a building on our left. \"It was emitting red, blue, green, and sharp white lights. Co-pilot Huseyin Kargi and Flight Engineer Pertev Arikan saw it too. We all three were in great astonishment that what we were seeing took our breath away.\" The giant object was about 2,000 meters from their craft, and was rotat- ing around its axis. According to Pilot Sivri, the object flew in front of them for 15 minutes. Then it disappeared with a fantastic speed. He reported his sighting to THY of- ficials and to Kandilli Observatory, and the object was determined as \"uniden- tified.\"  . . ' 10 Turkish Airlines (THY)pilot Se/abattin Siiri's encounter. Turkish jet pilot's dogfight On Aug. 7, 2001, two military pilots of the Turkish Air Force were witnesses to a very unusual incident. At about 12:30 PM, instructor pilot First Lt. Ilker Dincer and his student, Lt. Arda Gunyel, took off with a T-37 training aircraft from Squadron 122 in the city of Izmir, Turkey's third largest city on the west coast, for a training flight.. As they were flying over Candarli Gulf at an altitude of 15,000 feet and making maneuvers of adjustment and engine stopping, they encountered a UFO. After recovering from the shock, Lt. Dincer reported the situation to the ground control and the Regional Mili- tary Centre near Kutahya. Lt. Dincer reported to the operation center that \"we encounter an unusual situation. There is an extremely bright object resembling- a funnel or a pyra- mid with a leg flying at a very high speed.\". But the Centre's answer was, \"We de- tected your aircraft. But no other ob- MUFON UFO Journal ject around can be detected.\" Thereupon, Lt. Dincer directed the aircraft towards the mysterious object. According to his statement, the object did the same. The.UFO approached the T-37's wings and they started to fly to- gether. Dincer reported, \"Object is ap- proaching our wings. Now it's at the rear. I'll take it in the front by a maneuver. Object is now over us. This is literally dogfighting with us.\" The UFO made maneuvers around the aircraft for about 1.5 minutes as Dincer responded to the actions of the mysterious craft. The dangerous dog- fight ended with the disappearance of the UFO at a fantastic speed. Here is the full radio talk of Lt. Dincer and the base: T-37: Position Candarli. skies, we are facing an unusual situation. Base: What is the problem? T-37: There is a.very bright object resembling a funnel and a disk flying at a very high speed in 12 .o'clock position. Base: Continue; what's its position? T-37: It is approaching me at a very APRIL-2005"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"high speed from straight ahead. Imme- diately detect this object on the radars. I have never encountered such a thing. I suspect it is a UFO. Base: We detect your aircraft. But no other object can be detected on radar. T-37: We are turning the cursor to the object. Base: We cannot detect a second object other than you. T-37: The object is coming towards us. Base: Radar detect negative. T-37: Object is approaching our wings. Now it's at the rear. I'll take it in the front by a maneuver. Base: I repeat, radar detect negative. T-37: Object is now over us. This is literally dogfighting with us. Base: Continue T-37: Object suddenly disappeared. After returning to their base in Cigli (a district in the city of Izmir), the pi- lots reported the incident to their supe- riors. It was stated that there was much astonishment in the Air Force, and that the investigation continued. As this news was all over the front pages of the newspapers and on TV as breaking news, the Turkish Air Force had to make a press release where it was stated that the encountered object was a meteorology balloon! This statement was not taken seri- ously by the media, either. Also the Me- teorology Centre had stated that there were no balloons over that route on that date. One other thing is that before training flights the route is always checked for air traffic. No need to say it is a law of nature that no meteorology balloon can dog- fight with a jet at such high altitude and make such unconventional maneuvers. Let's not also forget that witnesses here are top pilots who are regularly checked- up. If we can't count on their words, then it means Turkey is in deep trouble! However the Air Force did not make any further statements after the objec- tions. The two pilots were not allowed to speak about the encounter, so they could not be reached at their base for any further details. The case was closed. 25 minutes with a UFO As the sighting above kept the media busy for days, another Turkish Airlines (THY) pilot had the courage to come forward and talk about the experience he had in 1975. Mehmet Oksum was working as a APRIL 2005 senior captain in the military at that time, and was flying in a military aircraft. One day in September, 1975, at around 9 PM, he took off from Kayseri Erciyes Air- port for Diyarbakir. Here is the story in his own words: \"We were flying at an altitude of 13,000 feet. My other colleagues were out in the cabin. That night, there was a full moon. Soon, as we were flying over Novak Mountain, I saw another object in the sky, which was as big and as bright as the moon. They were almost identi- cal.. \"I started to watch it very carefully. In the next five minutes, I was com- pletely shocked, so I called my friends to the cockpit. We were now eight people inside. \"The object started to grow bigger. With a rough comparison, I can say that the object became 1,000 times larger than the size of the moon [from their perspective]. \"It was in the size of a 6-7 story building. Then it started to come right towards us. It slightly changed shape and became oval. Then it started to open up in the middle. It opened up and up. \"It finally took the shape of a bicycle wheel with a diameter of 2-3 km. When we looked at its inside, we didn't recog- nize anything. It was very dark. We didn't notice anything inside. It was a beam of light in the shape of a bicycle wheel. \"We passed by each other from a dis- tance of about 2 miles. [The whole scene] lasted for about 20-25 minutes. Meanwhile, I called Sarykysla Tower with radio and asked them if they ob- served any object on radar screens, but their reply was negative. \"Then I checked with the meteorol- ogy; the wind was blowing from behind. In bewilderment, I noticed that the ob- ject was flying against the wind. \"Soon, we entered Malatya Airfield. Normally, we speak with Ground Con- trol when entering an airfield. When we contacted the Tower, a voice asked in excitement: 'Sir, have you seen an un- usual object in the air? Phone lines are locked by calls from head officials and Mayors of Erzurum, Elazig, Mardin. Public is in panic!' \"He said citizens had sighted an aerial object traveling in the sky spreading around colorful lights, and asked if we had seen it. I said I had seen an object, but added that it was not emitting col- MUFON UFO JOURNAL orful lights. I told him about the object I saw. \"We then passed to the city of Diyarbakyr. Inhabitants of Diyarbakyr were in panic too. Officials and mayors were calling the tower, asking if we had seen an unusual aerial object. I wanted to write a report about this incident, but our colonel told me not to do so. \"I have been flying for about 39 years. I have flight experience of above 20,000 hours, and I have never encountered this kind of an object before. I think [what we saw] was a UFO; it cannot be any- thing else. \"It was real. No one can say the op- posite; all my friends witnessed it. I can- not think of a pilot .who sees hallucina- tions. This is impossible in this occupa- tion. Otherwise, no plane would man- age to land. We pass through medical tests every 3-6 months.\" Bug-shaped UFO over Istanbul It was a rainy Sunday evening about 18:30 on May 26,'2002. Saffet Sap wanted to record the lightning on his video camera. As he started shooting, he saw a strange object in the sky. First he thought it was a kite or a plane. The object was stationary, but then it started to rise up in the air. Mr. Sap later said that it had about 7-8 legs. It looked like a giant bug. His sister saw this unusual object, too. The upper part of the object was flashing yellow, red, and green lights. There was green smoke coming out of the rear part. I was one of the speakers at the 2002 MUFON Conference in Rochester, NY. Jeff Sainio was a guest speaker, too, and during his lecture he showed some UFO footage looking exactly the same as the \"giant bug\" Mr. Sap had shot on his camera. More official sightings in 2004 Interestingly, officials have started to talk about their UFO sightings publicly over the past few years. One of the lat- est observations took place on March 30, 2004. Caner Yildiz, governor deputy of the city of Adana, filmed \"strange images\" he saw in the evening. He reports, \"It was about 21:04. My wife and I were watching TV. Then I saw a luminous object in the sky. First I thought it was a bright star that I had never seen before, then I recorded it on my camera for about 20 minutes. It was 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"moving very fast, sometimes zigzagging; becoming bigger and smaller. \"The bottom part, about one third of the object, was dark in color, yet the upper part was white. On its top were sharp projecting points like honey- combs. It was something we had never seen before; [something] we couldn't identify. \"It would disappear when observed with the naked eye, then would appear again. On the camera, it would look as small as a pin top, then in 2-3 seconds it would grow as big as an orange. It looked Gke a flying saucer.\" I am not sure if.it was a cover-up or not, but the footage was studied by TUBITAK National Observatory, and the object was concluded to be Venus. Whenever the national observatory scientists conduct such studies on simi- lar incidents, their conclusion about the nature of the object claimed to be a UFO-even with the most convincing cases—is always the planet Venus! There- fore, one can't help but wonder if it is the same old cover-up story. UFOs over refinery On July 20, 2004, Deputy Police Chief Mehmet Baydogan reported that police officers captured a UFO on video camera. The police had received calls about a sighting near the Free Zone, and offi- cers from the Bureau of Investigation and Identification arrived at the scene and filmed the luminous unidentified flying object at 4 AM. The officers reported the UFO was mostly crimson colored, with tones of yellow and green. It was round, and it was constantly moving and radiating light. After daybreak, the object as- cended and vanished. Ten days after this incident, Mersin Deputy Chief of Police Suleyman Ekizer announced that police officers recorded another luminous UFO over ATAS Refinery. Ekizer explained in the press confer- ence he held at the Security Department that an unidentified object in the sky over ATAS Refinery was reported to the information centre at about 3:30 AM. He also stated that investigation and identification teams went to the place in question and recorded the unidenti- fied flying object on video camera. The footage of the luminous object was shown to the press during the meeting. 12 CIA-MIT collaboration? It is encouraging that more and more officials have begun to talk about their UFO observations, and give informa- tion about them to the public in Tur- key. As there has been an obvious in- crease in such sightings since 1999, this must have caught the CIA's attention too! According to the news published on Feb. 6, 2003, in Vatan and Sabah news- papers, the CIA sent an official request to MIT (Turkish Intelligence Agency) asking for information on the UFO sightings and related incidents taking place in Turkey. Therefore, MIT commissioned a colonel to lead a research in coopera- tion with the Turkish Air Force. MIT also asked for pilots' observation reports from the Turkish Airlines. To my great surprise, this news was only in those two newspapers in small print, and not a word was mentioned about it on TV channels or anywhere else. You could find absolutely nothing in the papers the next day. Larry Bryant, in the US, made a FOIA request in June 27, 2003, for all CIA records pertaining to the Agency's alleged solicitation of, and receipt of, certain UFO data from the Turkish in- telligence agency, MIT. And another one in Aug. 5,2003. Here is the response he received on Jan. 20, 2004: Dear Mr. Bryant: Reference: F-2003-01199 This is in response to your letter dated 5 August 2003 in which you ap- pealed the 24 July 2003 determination of this Agency in response to your 27 June 2003 Freedom of Information Act request for the following: \"a copy of all CIA-generated and CIA-received records pertaining to the transmittal of UFO-related MIT information, along with any and all other records revealing CIA UFO-related solicitations directed to, coordinated with, and fulfilled by other intelligence services/operations conducted by foreign governments....\" Specifically, you appealed our deter- mination to neither confirm nor deny the existence or nonexistence of records pertaining to these records. The Agency Release Panel has con- sidered your appeal and has determined that the Agency can neither confirm nor deny the existence or nonexistence of records responsive to your request on MUFON UFO Journal the basis of Freedom of Information Act exemptions (b)(l) and (b)(3). Therefore, in accordance with Agency regulations, the Agency Release Panel has denied your appeal. For your infor- mation, Agency regulations are set forth in part 1900 of tide 32 of the Code of Federal Regulations. In accordance with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, you have the right to seek judicial review of this determination in a United States district court. We appreciate your patience while your appeal was being considered. Sincerely, Herbert O. Briick — Vice Chairman, Agency Release Panel As FOIA law had not been in force at the time here in Turkey, there wasn't a chance to make a similar request from the MIT. I am happy to say Turkey has passed the law recendy, and I shall in- form you about the response to my re- quest as soon as I receive it. Last words As can be seen, UFO activities are taking place in this part of the globe too, just like it is in every other part of- the world. However, it is amazing to see that UFO sightings and alien encounters are common everywhere, but other UFO- related phenomena like animal mutila- tions and crop circles take place mostiy in certain areas of the world. For example, there have never been any animal mutilations or crop circles reported in Turkey. Abductions do happen, but not so large in number. The other reason for that, apart from the fear of ridicule, might be that the whole phenomenon has started to be discussed publicly only within the last few years, so it is a new subject for the country. That's why there aren't many re- searchers. And among those few, there aren't many serious ones, unfortunately. Scientists are mosdy conservative, or they are afraid to lose their jobs in the case they disclose the truth. In 1999, when Turkey's first Inter- national UFO Conference was orga- nized, there were about 4,500 attend- ees in two days! But in the following years' conferences, we could not even come near that number. So, we realized that people attended the first conference out of curiosity, not out of interest! It APRIL 2005"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"is also very sad that there are no longer UFO conferences organized. But it must not be forgotten that Turkey is a developing country. So it is struggling with economic and political problems, and that means people are engaged with making their living and surviving. This certainly doesn't make the UFO and ET subject a priority for them! Behind this dark portrait, there is still light. We know that the Turkish National Intelligence Service (MIT) is collecting UFO reports. It was also very promis- ing to receive an official report of a UFO observation made by ten officials (Gendarmerie Headquarters staff and temporary rural guards) in the city of Adiyaman. The report was sent and signed by the governor of the city. Some of the officials have begun to talk about their UFO sightings openly. So things are changing gradually, and I believe more positive things will happen as we solve our economic and political problems. Jesse Marcel Jr. reports experiences in Iraq By George Filer Army Col. Jesse Marcel, Jr., 69, of Roswell fame, and an M.D who was called back to active duty in Iraq, writes, \"I am doing OK and happy with my assignment, although the extreme heat has not arrived yet. I fly at least once or twice a week in a Blackhawk, and had seven hours flying time yesterday going from Baghdad to Mosel, to Tikrit, Urbil and Kirkut. \"I have to say it is gratifying to see the folks in the countryside (shepherds) wave a greeting to us as we fly low level. We also do 'candy bombs' where pack- ages of candy are dropped out when kids are seen. We had to 'orbit' over Kirkut for 15 minutes yesterday, and had some rocks thrown at us, but we got the hell out before bullets were launched, but that is an exception. \"Locally the daily mortar barrages on the camp have declined to only three or four attacks a week, a decided improve- ment since the elections,...although it is a very dangerous place yet. \"My old Humvee was replaced with an armored Humvee with bullet proof windows to drive.\" —Thanks to Jesse Marcel and Bond Johnson. APRIL 2005 MUFON Forum Jennings' TV show on ABC By Budd Hopkins During the past year, Peter Jennings' producers interviewed me a number of times, and because I sensed what they had in mind, I made, as a preemptive strike, a number of careful, highly spe- cific observations about the UFO ab- duction phenomenon. All of these crucial points-recorded by ABC on videotape-were designed to underline the physical reality of UFO abductions, and to demonstrate the im- plausibility of current skeptical expla- nations. To its shame, ABC suppressed ALL of these observations. I knew, of course, that the skeptics' favorite explanation du jour is impossibly simple: abduction re- ports, they believe, are all due to misperceived \"sleep paralysis.\" Ranking as a distant second is an- other erroneous belief: abduction re- ports, they say, \"ONLY emerge under hypnosis,\" and, since hypnosis is \"to- tally unreliable,\" all abduction reports must be discarded. In the light of these tediously famil- iar errors and misstatements, I made certain in my taped interviews to explain the following: In the first two decades of our re- search, ALL of the central abduction cases involved people who were outside their houses when they were taken. NONE were lying paralyzed in their bedrooms. They were driving cars, walking, fishing, hunting, and even, in one famous case, driving a tractor on a farm. \"Sleep paralysis\" as a blanket expla- nation of UFO abductions is therefore, ipso facto, a ludicrous non-starter. Nev- ertheless, ALL of my insistent state- ments on this point were systematically eliminated by the producers. Second, I indicated that there are many abduction reports involving two, three, six, or more people who were taken simultaneously, and whose highly- detailed recollections are virtually iden- tical. This fact alone eliminates not only \"sleep paralysis,\" but \"fantasy-prone- MUFON UFO JOURNAL ness\" or any other idiosyncratic psycho- logical aberrations as triggering causes. My descriptions of these many cases of multiple abductions were likewise com- pletely suppressed by the producers. Third, I showed the interviewers many photos of, again, virtually identi- cal scoop marks, consistent straight-line scars, ground landing traces at abduc- tion sites, and other physical sequelae. ALL of these vivid photographic ex- amples of physical evidence were sup- pressed by the producers. Fourth, I was not alone in making these points. My colleague, Dr. David Jacobs, was asked by ABC to carry out a hypnotic regression for the camera, but since-the woman he chose had been ab- ducted in the daytime while driving a car, the case did not fit ABC's \"sleep paralysis\" agenda and was thus not only suppressed, but Dr. Jacobs' many hours of taped interviews were also scrapped. Fifth, I made it very clear that per- haps 30% of all the abduction reports collected by researchers are recalled WITHOUT THE AID OF HYPNO- SIS, a fact which renders the issue of hypnosis moot. This point was also sup- pressed by the producers, whose only goal, it appeared, was to eliminate any data that contradicted their transpar- ently false debunking hypotheses. Despite my having presented-and reiterated-the points above, the produc- ers chose to trot out on camera two debunking scientists (whose experi- ments with a mere handful of subjects have yet to be taken seriously by the psy- chological community) to buttress the untenable \"sleep paralysis\" theory, the false \"no physical evidence\" claim, and the demonstrably untrue \"its all hypno- sis\" assertion.

Reviewed by Dwight Connelly As the author points out, California, with at least 5,000 UFO reports, leads the nation in cases, and thus certainly deserves its own book. Dennett is an es- tablished, re- spected ufologist, having personally dealt with more than a hundred cases in California as a MUFON in- vestigator over the past twenty years. He is perhaps best known for his book UFOs OverTopanga Canyon: Eyeudt- ness Accounts of the California Sightings, pub- lished in 1999, but is also the author of Extraterrestrial Visitations: True Accounts of Contact (20Q\\), OneinForty-The UFO Epi- demic: True Accounts of Close Encounters nnth UFOs (1997), and UFO Healings: True Ac- counts of People Healed by Extraterrestrials (1996). UFOs OverCalifornials a comprehen- sive look at ufology in California from the 1890's to the present, divided into time periods, specific areas of the state, and types of sightings. The footnoting is extensive, there is a 32-page full-color section featuring pho- tos and drawings, there is an appendix listing unexplained Blue Book cases from California, and there is an alphabetical list- ing of the numerous sources used in com- piling the reports. Unfortunately, there is no index. The fact that this book covers so many reports is both its strong point and its weak point-strong because it is so com- plete, but weak because most readers will not be able to sift the more reliable re- ports from the less reliable reports, as 14 most cases seem to be presented as though they are of equal credibility. Uninvestigated reports from Filer's Files in the journal are just not on a par with cases which the author has person- ally investigated in Topanga Canyon, to cite only one example. Those knowledgeable in the field can, of course, evaluate particular reports based on the source of the report (as ref- erenced by the extensive endnotes for the cases), the number of witnesses, and so forth. But those without this experience and background will find it impossible to separate the reliable researchers and cases from the questionable. On the other hand, perhaps providing a complete picture of cases without tak- ing the space to evaluate quality is the only logical way to approach a book of this type. Although this book is not perfect (what book is?), it is an important contribution to the field by an experienced researcher. Because of the sheer number of re- ports from California, as well as the sig- nificant types of cases from this state (more underwater reports than any other state, the enigma of Edwards Air Force Base, etc.), this book should be of inter- est not only to Californians, but to read- ers everywhere. nitely recommended.

Reviewed by Dwight Connelly The author, Dr. Robert Trundle, un- like many individuals in ufology, holds a legitimate Ph.D in philosophy from the University of Colorado, and is a member of the New York Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical MUFON UFO Journal Association, and numerous other re- spected groups. He is the author of six other books, including UFOs: Politics, God & Science (2001), and From Physics to Politics (1999). In Is ETHere? Dr. Trundle cov- ers a wide range of topics, such as Science on An- gels and Aliens, Alien Anatomy and Technology, Singular People and Strange Places, Official Reports and Odd En- counters, Outlandish Organizations and Intriguing Issues, Military Projects and Moon Missions, and Controversy Over Religion and Science. The five appendices, including the always impressive Bernard Haisch's Open Letter to His Colleagues, provide additional information and insights. Sprinkled throughout this detailed and at times challenging book are 186 illustrations-some related to the text, and some apparently included to break up the type or to provide additional items of interest to the reader. Although there is an index, it is too small for a book with this much infor- mation (at least in the advanced galley copy which I received for review). An interesting feature is a series of biographies of the members of the al- leged MJ-12 group which clearly dem- onstrates that the backgrounds and as- sociations of these individuals are ap- propriate for MJ-12 membership. In a sort of introduction to the book's purpose is the following, which also suggests its reading level: \"Human pride and an imposition of politics on science are the best explana- tions for impeded scientific progress and a close-mindedness to one of the most astonishing possibilities in history: that ET is here.

On the other, religion and science will be muddled by those who interpret either angels as aliens or aliens as angels. The former interpretation reduces the supernatural to natural phe- nomena, and the latter elevates that phenomena to the supernatural.\" The author employs a number of well-known individuals to \"add credibil- ity to this book, including Peter Gersten, who writes the first Forward, and Dr. Peter Redpath, who writes the second Fore ward. He also utilizes quotes from individu- als such as Professor Michael Zimmerman of Tulane University, Dr. John Mack, and Dr. Richard Haines in associating his presentation with re- spected individuals. Credible research- ers such as Dr. David Jacobs, Budd Hopkins, Stan Friedman, Dr. J. Allen Hynek are utilized in presenting specific cases. On the other hand, he finds the work of George Adamski, Robert Lazar, Ri- chard Doty, and Col. Philip Corso worth discussing in an apparently positive light. And while there are numerous refer- ences in the endnotes, there are also too many statements regarding cases and events that are not credibly documented, such as the alleged \"Project Sigma\" and his description of the Cash-Landrum in- cident.   • Not only is there unjustified reliance on individuals like Doty and Corso, but also on popular UFO books which themselves utilize unreliable or incom- plete sources. Thus this book, like so many others, is a mixed bag of reliable, significant, interesting information and questionable information. One is forced to ask: What is there about the field of ufology that prevents so many authors from separating the re- liable from the unreliable, the credible from the questionable? Why do the APRIL 2005 good and the bad have to be intermixed so that the average individual attempt- ing to learn about ufology cannot tell the difference? For some authors this failing can be attributed to lack of research, lack of experience, lack of ability, or simply lack of caring, but for an author with the intelligence and background of Dr. Trundle, it is troubling. There is much in this book which is excellent; it is too bad the poor material was not eliminated or at least put in per- spective. MUFON Forum... (Continued from Page 13) mental health professionals had come to me about their own UFO abductions. The producers' obvious goal was to con- ceal the fact that within the mental health community there are many pro- fessionals who look with amusement on the \"sleep paralysis\" theory, and who accept the physical reality of UFO ab- ductions. So what can one say about such a deliberately dishonest presentation as Peter Jenning's take on abductions? Perhaps one can only shrug and warn, yet again, that the incurious members of the press and the many blinkered, conservative scientists had better col- lectively pull their heads up out of the sand and join us in our work. Whatever one's personal attitude to- ward the UFO abduction phenomenon, science insists that an extraordinary phenomenon demands an extraordinary investigation. What ABC served up was, instead, an extraordinary whitewash of the ab- duction phenomenon, and a brutal sup- pression of the evidence for what may well be the most portentous event in human history. Peter Jennings and his staff should be ashamed. Bill O'Riley show not awful By Bruce Maccabee Wild Bill O'Reilly has had his say on UFOs and, indirectly, on Jennings' show. He devoted 61/2 minutes of his March 11 show to the subject. Bill isn't im- pressed. • Guest Mark' Rodeghier was straightfaced, but Bill had a continual \"Mona Lisa Smile,\" some might say a smirk, when asking whether or not Mark MUFON UFO JOURNAL really, believed what he was saying. Unexplained sightings are not unex- pected. But what bothers him is that with all the scientific stuff (satellites, telescopes, etc.) there is no clear evi- dence. O'Reilly is not impressed with the conspiracy theory-government cover- up. Bill doesn't buy abductions, even though he apparently talked to some lady who made a claim of a sighting (and abduction?). Guest Jed Turnbull of the Intruders Foundation said he believes because the people come to him with consistent sto- ries. Bill pointed out that all one has to do is read the Internet to find out what is \"supposed\" to happen during an ab- duction. People could be making up sto- ries for attention. He asked Mark, do you believe that there are hundreds of people who have been abducted? Mark indirectly said yes. But Bill went back to \"gaining attention\" as the reason for reporting such stories. Jed commented that there were ab- ductions even in NYC, and Bill re- sponded in a jocular manner that he could walk outside and find 18 aliens in New York. He ended on a skeptical note with- out being debunking about it. He did not have a \"noted skeptic\" on the show. The show ended with O'Reilly challeng- ing the aliens to pick on someone their own size... him. (Obvously, he doesn't know of the dimimutive size of most aliens.) I gather that it was all an amus- ing laugh for him. However, he did not mount a strong counter-argument that there is nothing to it. He basically left it that he wasn't convinced, so there! Perhaps the important positive fact is that he allowed the exposure of the subject without trying to tear Mark or Jed apart, so perhaps some of his two million(?) viewers will be given the in- centive to contact the'Center or the In- truders Foundation. Angel hair questions By Mark Isganitis I found the article on angel hair in the Feb 2005 MUFON UFO Journal very interesting, especially the scientific analysis. It seems to me, by the chemi- cal analysis presented, this stuff should be extremely flammable. Could angel hair emitting craft be the 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"source of some of these fireball sightings we. have had over the years? Another question I did not see asked: Since this stuff is organic in origin, are there any known organisms that pro- duce a similar substance (including all the hydrocarbon compounds)? Is it possible to reproduce this sub- stance in a laboratory, and,-if so,'how difficult would it be? I know you probably don't have the answers to these questions, but it may be interesting to bring them up the next time this is discussed in a public forum. Editor's Note: Mark's inquiry was forwarded to Phyllis Budinger, analyti- cal chemist with Frontier Analysis, Ltd., whose research with angel hair was fea- tured in a sidebar article in the Febru- ary issue. Her response follows: Question 1. Angel hair is not flam- mable, for example, like gasoline etc. When exposed to a match it almost in- stantly fizzles to a trace amount of black char similar to the burning of hair. I do not relate angel hair to UFO fireballs. Question 2. There are known organ- isms that produce a similar substance. However,-! can't say that I know of any that also produce hydrocarbons. About four years ago I consulted with an entomologist (Cleveland Museum of Natural History). I wanted to know, what other insects besides ballooning spiders produced massive amounts of silk-like material. He sent the message around to a number of his colleagues. His answer was: \"There are numerous lep larvae that balloon as well, usually as neo- nates.\" Also attached was a message- from another colleague. The italics are my additions. \"Larvae of many Lepi- doptera, particularly those with wing- less adult females (e.g. some Lymantriidae (Gypsy Moth) and Geomedtridae. (Inchworms), disperse by ballooning as first instars.\" I would like to add a further com- ment about the light hydrocarbons. They were clearly present in small amounts in a sample from California (Nov 22, 1999). This is the only angel hair event where hydrocarbons have been detected. ' However, I worry that the witness' truck exhaust may have contaminated the sample. The truck was close by, and I don't know if the engine was running or not when he collected the sample. 16 Even if it was not running there may have been enough residual hydrocar- bons to contaminate the sample. So the jury is still out whether this came from the angel hair. Eventually we may be lucky enough for another observant witness to grab a sample and seal it tightly in a Zip Lock or a clean jar. Question 3. Why reproduce it in a laboratory when you can use caterpil- lars, etc. to produce it? More about angel hair. So far, I have examined 7 or 8 samples, which were all from the United States and col- lected between September and Novem- ber when most people tend to notice them, though spider ballooning may take place any time of the year for some spe- cies, depending on the climes. (I have written formal reports on five events.) I would like to examine samples from other countries and from other times of the year. Some of the samples I.have looked at are spider web. I.see sticky droplets and eggs under the microscope.. A few appeared .different. These samples did not have the droplets and eggs. And a single fiber was of a smaller denier than a reference of spider silk. The infrared spectrum, while very simi- lar to spider silk, was closer to caterpil- lar silk. As you can see, a lot more analysis has to be done on good reliable samples, and hopefully with witnesses who also reported UFO activity in the area. Maybe we will get lucky? Teleportation works again By Stefan Lovgren for National Geographic News Austrian researchers have teleported photons (particles of light) under the Danube River in Vienna, using technol- ogy that calls to mind Scotty beaming up Captain Kirk in the Star Trek sci- ence fiction series. \"We were able to perform a quan- tum teleportation experiment for the first time ever outside a university labo- ratory,\" said Rupert Ursin, a researcher at the Institute for Experimental Phys- ics at the University of Vienna in Aus- tria. The researchers read the \"blueprints\" of the photons they wanted to teleport. They then broke up the photons into smaller particles called quantum bits, and sent these bits, along with the blue- prints, through a fiber-optic cable in a sewage pipe under the river. At the other end, replicas of the origi- nal photons were created. The original photons ceased to exist once the repli- cas were created. Quantum teleportation may have progressed from science fiction to real- ity, but don't look for a Star Trek trans- porter anytime soon. This science has little to do with beaming people from one place to another. Instead, scientists hope the technol- ogy could become crucial for quantum computing and quantum cryptology, areas that promise to make computing much faster and 100 percent secure. Teleportation involves dematenabz- MUFON UFO Journal ing an object at one point and transfer- ring the precise details of its configura- tion to another location, where the ob- ject is then reconstructed. Teleportation was long considered impossible because it violates the so- called uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics. As the principle goes, the act of measuring a tiny particle destroys it. So theoretically, an exact replica of a particle can never be made. But in 1993 scientists showed a way around the problem by using a complex concept known as entanglement, an area of physics that Albert Einstein referred to as \"spooky action at a distance.\" Since then, numerous experiments using photons have proved that quan- tum teleportation is possible. Scientists have teleported quantum bits along more than a mile (1.6 kilometers) of fi- ber-optic wire inside laboratories. The problem, for now, is that the quantum technology only works over limited distances. Physicists are now lay- ing the groundwork for so-called quan- tum repeaters. Used in regular communications, these devices would allow messages to be transmitted around the world. So what are the chances of develop- ing a transporter that can beam people from one location to.another, Star Trek- style? \"Nothing we do will help us build Scotty's apparatus,\" Ursin said. \"The reason is very simple: A human body contains too much information to scan and build all replicas.\" .

It feels wonderful to be free of the responsibility for man- aging and administrating MUFON for 30 years. It is hard to believe that nearly five years have since elapsed. Moving the MUFON headquarters and museum to Littleton, CO, was planned for the last weekend of Sep- tember. However, the passing of my wife, Jeanne, on Sept. 20, 2000, was not anticipated. Tom Deuley, MUFON Corporate Secretary, not only supervised the load- ing of the largest U-Haul truck avail- able, but also drove it to Littleton and helped unload it with the assistance of MUFON Colorado members. I have since made two additional trips with my Dodge pickup loaded with fur- niture and Symposium Proceedings. Although relatively inactive com- pared to my past position, I am still in- volved with MUFON in the following capacities: submitted several UFO ar- ticles for publication in the MUFON UFO Journal; have three pending UFO investigations; serve on the MUFON Staff as Amateur Radio Director; con- tinue to attend monthly UFO meetings in San Antonio, TX; purchase current UFO-related books for the MUFON li- brary; continue to make video copies of current TV programs for the MUFON library; and of course forward MUFON mail to Morrison, CO.

Friedman Jennings Program on ABC By the time you read this, you will have read a ton of verbiage about the Feb. 24 Peter Jennings ABC \"UFOs: Seeing is Believing.\" I think it is appro- priate for me to comment, since so many people sent me emails about it. Almost all were sympathetic about what they considered the unfair treat- ment that I and the Roswell incident re- ceived. The producers in Roswell inter- viewed me for more than an hour in July, 2004. Don Schmitt, who has been ac- tive in Roswell research for many years, was also interviewed. He and a film crew actually went out to the site, which was marked out for more archeological dig- ging- About 20 seconds of my interview was shown, with none of Don's nor of the scientific work site. I had been cau- tiously optimistic after hearing a few weeks before the showing that I had made the cut, but that 100 people had not. My optimism decreased when I heard that Seth Shostak, Frank Drake, and Jill Tartar (SETI Specialists), as well as Michael Shermer, skeptic, were going to be on. Despite all their writing about SETI, it was clear that none knew anything about UFOs. Proclamation is not the same as investigation. I had jokingly told people that, after all, Peter Jennings and I were both dual citizens of the USA and Canada and, surprisingly, both had been born on July 29. How could I not trust him? I didn't place enough emphasis on the fact that Benito Mussolini was also born on July 29. I was favorably impressed with the first portion, with interviews with air- craft crewmembers, comments about Blue Book's -focus on explaining away sightings, and the interview with Major Friend, whom I had met at Blue Book in the early 1960s. The second half of the show was like a horror film. The SETI people waxed 20 Stan Friedman poetic about their wonderful search for ET Signals. There was no indication of any knowledge of UFOs, other than one of the sillier moments of the show when Jill Tartar described having a sighting of the moon partially obscured by clouds. This was worth re-creating?? One can see why the SETI people don't want to deal with eyewit- ness testimony. I think one could also see why I say that SETI stands for Silly Effort to Investigate, and why I talk of the cult of SETI: Charis- matic hand waving, very strong dogma (they must be out there, they can't be coming here, we will make the most important dis- covery in Man's history a signal from a distant civilization, and nobody could possibly come here... if they did, we would be out of a job) and strong irra- tional claims about the absence of evi- dence. Meaning \"we don't dare review it-\" Shostak proclaims when he finds a signal they will tell everybody else, who will then verify it, and anybody can use his own antenna. What happens if the transmission stops? How many can afford their own Hat Creek Telescope. System? Does he think the signal will be \"Testing 1, 2\" repeated over and over again? That we can order the saucer to stop while we do measurements? Dr. Tyson joined the crowd and pro- claimed that eyewitness testimony may be OK in court, but not in science. Tell Jane Goodall that. Several times PJ used the term main- stream science along with a proclama- tion about its non-acceptance of UFO reality. No evidence was presented. It appears that the only mainstream MUFON UFO Journal science he was talking about was as- tronomy. Think of chemists, biologists, and geologists, us physicists, etc. Much of science today was based on eyewit- ness testimony of something unusual. Think Roentgen and X rays. I believe that most mainstream sci- entists like me believe that the method- ology has to suit the problem. Unpre- dictable, brief appearances of strange craft (not under the control of the ob- server or of Mother Nature) behaving in strange ways require eyewitness tes- timony, as of course do airplane crashes, crimes, etc. Polls have consistently shown that the greater the education the more likely to accept UFO reality. Two polls of Re- search and Development people showed that about 2/3 of them who expressed an opinion said flying saucers were real. But then they live in the real world, un- like the SETI Cultists. The program contained, as might be expected based on past experience, a major put-down on star travel from people who know absolutely nothing about space travel. We were told that the Voyager space- craft, our fastest spacecraft, launched 30 years ago, will take 73,000 years to reach the nearest star, and that the fastest man-made object goes only 11 miles per second, compared to the speed of light at 186,000 miles per sec. Wow! Sounds like we sure can't get there from here. These are both totally misleading. The Voyager hasn't been at- tached to a propulsion system since it left the vicinity of the earth!! It is coast- ing. This is like tossing a bottle into the ocean or a feather into the air as a basis for estimating crossing time for the Queen Mary 2 or the SST or the space station. We physicists have accelerated par- ticles in the vacuum chambers of ex- pensive accelerators to speeds of 99.99 % of the speed of light. 11 mps is ab- surd. Space is a very large vacuum chamber. These totally misleading comments APRIL 2005"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"rank on a par with Dr. Simon Newcombe's claim in October, 1903, (two months before the Wright Broth- ers' first flight) that the only way man would fly would be with the help of a balloon. Dr. Bickerton in the 1920s proved \"scientifically\" that it would be impos- sible to provide enough energy to put anything into orbit. Dr. Campbell in 1941 \"scientifically\" calculated that the required initial launch weight of a rocket able to get a man to the moon and back would be a million million tons. He was, because of his total ignorance about space flight, off by a factor of 300,000,000. All three were, like the SETI cultists, astronomers. With this track record, why believe any of their proclamations? I was involved more than 40 years ago in work on a fusion propulsion sys- tem able to eject particles having 10 million times as much energy per par- ticle as in a chemical rocket. This of course was not presented. After all, I was just a promoter. A real hatchet job was done on Budd Hopkins in the show's segment on UFO abductions. The witnesses were OK, but then we have the off-the-wall proc- lamations about sleep paralysis being the explanation, coupled with hypnosis to generate false testimony from the wit- nesses. All the data provided by Budd about the fact that many abductions don't take place in bed (think Betty and Barney Hill, Travis Walton, etc), that there are many cases when more than one'per- son is abducted (is sleep paralysis con- tagious?), and that at least 30% of ab- duction investigations do not involve hypnosis was left on the cutting room floor. Budd has worked with more than 600 abductees. Had the two Harvard psy- chologists worked with more than a dozen? Why wasn't any of Harvard psy- chiatrist John Mack's interview run? The pronouncement that there is no benefit of hypnosis in memory enhance- ment is false. Phil Klass made the same claim to me, but stopped when I pro- vided an article about a stonemason be- ing able, under hypnosis, to describe tiny details on a particular stone that he had placed years earlier. Finally we have the Roswell segment. I was introduced as a Roswell promoter. The term was used twice. There was no APRIL 2005 mention of the fact that I was a nuclear physicist who had worked for the likes of GE, GM, Westinghouse, etc. The totally unjustifiable term myth was used at least twice. PJ should be ashamed. Jesse Marcel junior was filmed. There. was no mention of the fact that he is a medical doctor, a flight surgeon colo- nel in the reserve, and serving in Iraq despite being 67. His father was called an intelligence officer, but without adding that the group was the most elite military group in the world, the 509th, which had dropped the A bombs on Japan. Don't these facts go to credibility? Of course I am a Roswell promoter, based on 27 years of research and in- vestigation, the outlay of thousands of dollars and thousands of hours, find- ing loads of supporting testimony, and visits to 20 archives—all ignored by the noisy negativists, and none of this pre- sented in the program. At the request of the producers I had provided a total of 57 videos from which they used a few clips. One video was the 105-minute \"Recollections of Roswell,\" which included testimony from 27 witness, including Retired Gen- eral Thomas Jefferson DuBose. He told me of taking the call from Gen. Clements McMullen, head of SAC, who was the boss of 8th Air Force Commander Roger Ramey (who was DuBose's boss), saying to get the press off their back, send some wreckage up here today, and never talk about it again. For reasons unknown, they had his- torian Robert Goldberg tell the Roswell tale, although he was seriously in error in his description of Roswell in his book about conspiracies arid on the show. They gave Karl Pflock quite a bit of time with his Roswell debunking. They blindly accepted the Mogul Balloon ex- planation, even though there is no evi- dence to support it-the materials char- acteristics don't match witness testi- mony, and the dates and locations are wrong. They stressed the high security for Mogul... vastly overstated, since several launches were allowed to just drop in the desert-no chase planes or ground teams. At least the crash test dummies weren't paraded. I have dealt with all the objections in my MUFON 2003 paper \"Critiquing the Roswell Critics.\" The real promoters on the show were the SETI cultists with their myths. They MUFON UFO JOURNAL have no evidence of any kind that there is anybody out there, that there are sig- nals being sent, or that they can receive and interpret such signals if there are any, using our primitive technology. An AM radio can't pick up FM signals. They can't admit that there is overwhelming evidence of alien visitation. It appears that the producers were perfectly willing to present some inter- esting testimony, though they left out things like Project Blue Book Special Report 14, other large scale scientific studies, and the statement by AF Gen. Carroll Bolender that reports of UFOs which could affect national security were not part of the Blue Book system. But the three areas of investigation that clearly together establish both the cover-up and that the planet is being visited (Roswell, abductions, and the fact that interstellar travel is feasible with reasonable trip times) were trashed. Sounds like when push came to shove they lacked any courage at all. It was nice to give a neat segment at the end of the program to Michio Kaku saying that maybe visitors are well ahead of us and can warp space and time. Fusion propulsion systems are much closer in time. Blacked out and whited out government UFO documents force one to the conclusion that the govern- ment is not just incompetent with Blue Book, but lying through its teeth. Perhaps I should mention that only 11.6 million people watched the show. The Unsolved Mysteries program on NBC in 1989 about Roswell was seen by over 28 million people the first time around and 30 million the second time. Particularly irritating was the frequent mention of lights in the sky, billions of stars, and absence of physical evidence. There was not even the slightest men- tion of Ted Phillips' 3000+ excellent physical trace cases from 90 countries. Why show Chris McKay digging in desert dirt and not the traces left by a UFO? Frankly I was also bothered by the proclamations by nasty noisy negativist retired USAF officer James McGaha. We had a full-scale debate in Tennes- see. The video is noted at my website: \"http://www.stantonfriedman.com\" It is easy to say we need both sides. But is that true when one side does his research by investigation and the other side does it by proclamation?
