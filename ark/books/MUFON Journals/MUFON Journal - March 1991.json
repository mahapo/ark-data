Carpenter, a professional therapist, is a MUFON state section director living in Springfield. To a five-year-old kid from In- dianapolis, the mountains and mesas and vast scrubland surrounding Albu- querque seemed an alien world. \"I was in awe,\" recalls Gerald Ander- son of his arrival in New Mexico with his family in July 1947. \"I was in the wild frontier. There were real, live In- dians out there.\" Then, says Anderson, on his second day in the Southwest, he bumped into real live creatures from a truly alien world. There were four — two dead, one dy- ing, one apparently uninjured. The creatures were about four feet tall, with heads disproportionately large for their bodies by human measure, and almond- shaped, coal black eyes. They huddled in the shadow of a 50-foot-diameter silver disc — a \"flying saucer\" that had crashed into a low hillside on the rim of what locals call the Plains of San Agustin. Anderson, a former police chief at Rockaway Beach and Taney County deputy sheriff, who now works as a security officer in Springfield, is ada- mant about events on that hot midsum- mer day so long ago. \"I saw them. I even touched one of the creatures. I put my hand on their ship. And I wasn't alone — my dad, my uncle, my brother and my cousin all saw the same things. And so did a lot of other people. But they aren't talking.\" Anderson is talking, publicly, after 43 years of silence. Among those listening most intently are some of the foremost researchers into unidentified flying object (UFO) phenomena. These experts say Gerald Anderson appears to be an impor- tant link in a frustratingly fragmented chain of evidence concerning the most famous — or infamous — chapter in UFO annals: the so-called \"Roswell In- cident.\" No one denies that something hap- pened in July 1947 in central New Mexico, cradle of U.S. nuclear and rocket technology. However, military authorities insist reports of strange craft in the sky and bizarre wreck- age on the ground were traced at the time to an errant weather balloon and other manmade or natural circum- stance. Nonetheless, over the years, persis- tent whispered rumors grew into published articles and books, even movies, which fanned speculation that what actually occurred was a visit by creatures from another planet — an intergalactic expedition that turned to tragedy on the high desert and then into a massive coverup in the highest circles of the U.S. government. Anderson says he was unaware of ongoing fascination and controversy over the strange episode from his childhood, until one evening this past January when he was flipping through channels on his television set and stumbled across the popular program \"Unsolved Mysteries.\" \"I wasn't looking for any unsolved mysteries — I have enough mysteries in my life that are unsolved, and I don't need any more,\" Anderson jokes. He is a burly, barrel-chested man, standing 6-4 and carrying a muscular 250-plus pounds, with reddish hair and a ruddy complexion creased from easy laughter. \"But, bingo! On comes this story, and everything was wrong,\" Anderson recalls of the TV show. On sudden im- pulse, he dialed an 800 phone number that flashed onto the screen. \"I guess I figured that if people were still in- terested in this thing, they might as well get it straight\" is the only ex- planation he can muster for speaking up after years of keeping mostly mum on the matter. \"These people don't know what they're talking about,\" Anderson told the operator on the other end of the long-distance line. \"The shape of the craft is totally wrong. And how do you know that, sir?' she asked. 'I saw it. I was there,' I told her. ' Whoa!' she said, 'There are some people who will want to talk to you ...' \" Anderson's phone soon was ringing with calls from UFO researchers around the country. One in particular, Stanton Friedman, a nuclear physicist and popular lecturer who had advised the \"Unsolved Mysteries\" producers, was struck by correlations between Anderson's recollections and obscure details Friedman uncovered while sleuthing for a book to be published next year. Friedman, who lives in Canada, con- tacted John Carpenter, a Springfield professional therapist who in his spare time serves as state section director for the local chapter of Mutual UFO Net- work, a worldwide organization of UFO researchers. At Friedman's re- quest, Carpenter conducted extensive in-person interviews of Anderson, in- cluding sessions under hypnosis. T he results excited Friedman. \"Powerful stuff!\" he exclaimed upon hearing interview tapes. Friedman arranged airline tickets for Anderson and Carpenter to join him in New Mexico to pinpoint the crash site. Anderson says the flight was his first return to New Mexico in more than a quarter-century. After pointing the pilot of a chartered helicopter to a spot in the desert 75 air miles southwest of Albu- querque, Anderson gazed at a hillside, strewn with boulders the size of Volkswagens and dotted with a few gnarled pinon trees, that he says he last saw in the summer of 1947... MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 275 March 1991"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"New Home The Anderson family arrived in Albuquerque from Indiana on July 4, 1947. They took up temporary residence at the home of one of Gerald's uncles, Guy Anderson. Gerald's father, Glen, was about to take a job as a master machinist involved in nuclear weapons design at the super-secret Sandia base on the outskirts of town. The next day, another uncle, Ted, struck up a conversation with Gerald's older brother, Glen Jr., who was on leave from the Marine Corps. Glen Jr. was a rockhound, and his uncle piqued the young Marine's enthusiasm with tales of gorgeous stones just waiting to be collected in the desert. \"Ted told my brother, 'I know where there's plenty of moss agate.' So we all piled into a 1940 Plymouth — Uncle Ted, my cousin Victor (Ted's eight- year-old son), my brother Glen, my dad and myself. We went out into this area where the most agate was supposed to be — followed two ruts into the desert, bounced along out there for a while, and ended up on top of a ridgeline. We parked the car and started to walk down an arroyo (gully) and dry creek bed and out onto the plains. Strange Discovery \"But we came around a corner and right there in front of us, stuck into the side of this hill, was a silver disc. There were some remarks like, 'There's a crash up here. Something's crashed up here!' And then someone saying, That's a goddam spaceship!' \"We all went up there to it. There were three creatures, three bodies, ly- ing on the ground underneath this thing in the shade. Two weren't moving, and the third one obviously was having trou- ble breathing, like when you have broken ribs. There was a fourth one next to it, sitting there on the ground. There wasn't a thing wrong with it, and it apparently had been giving first aid to the others.\" Anderson animatedly acts out the fourth creature's reaction when the family members approached. \"It recoil- ed in fear, like it thought we were going to attack it,\" Anderson recounts, cover- ing his face with crossed arms. The adults tried repeatedly to communicate with the frightened creature, Anderson says, but there was no audible response to greetings spoken in English and Spanish. A few minutes after the Anderson clan happened upon the bizarre scene, six other people arrived — five college students and their teacher. They'd been working on an archeological dig around cliff dwellings a few miles away and had decided to hike over after seeing what they thought was a fiery meteor crashing the night before. The pro- fessor, a Dr. Buskirk, tried several foreign languages in unsuccessful at- tempts to coax a verbal response from the creature, Anderson says. The sun had climbed to a midday peak by this time and, recalls Ander- son, \"to a kid from Indiana, it was hot, brother, let me tell you.\" He'd chugged a chocolate-flavored soft drink an hour earlier, and the sweet soda pop was churning uncomfortably in his stomach. So he sought shelter in the shadow of the spacecraft. \"It was 115 (degrees) out there that day. But around the craft, when you got close to it, it was cold. When you touched the metal, it felt just like it came out of a freezer.\" Something Not Right Anderson also touched one of the creatures lying motionless on the ground — and it, too, was cold. In his child's mind, he had thought the figures looked like dolls. But when he felt the cold skin, \"I knew something wasn't quite right. Yuck!\" Anderson says he ran to the crest of a nearby knoll to take stock. A pickup truck arrived on the ridge, and a fellow whom researchers believe was a civil engineer named Barney Barnett joined the curious audience. \"I remember thinking he looked like Harry Truman. In 1947, every kid knew what Harry Truman looked like,\" Anderson says. After a few minutes, Anderson sum- moned the courage to again creep close to the strange surface. It was then he says, he felt something more chilling than the surface of the craft or the skin of the corpse: The upright creature \"turned and looked right at me, and it was like he was inside my head — as if he was doing my thinking, as if his thoughts were in my head.\" Anderson remembers a mental sen- sation of falling and tumbling end-over- end. \"I felt that thing's fear, felt its depression, felt its loneliness. I relived the crash. I know the terror it went through. That one look told me every- thing that quickly,\" he says with a snap of his fingers. O ther things began happening quickly about this time, Ander- son says. A contingent of armed soldiers suddenly appeared. The creature, which had calmed down after its initial fright, \"went crazy\" at the sight of the soldiers. Thinking back on the creature's plight today brings on \"the awfulest, horrible feeling,\" Ander- son says. \"His situation was hopeless. He knew it. He'd just lived through a nightmare that most of us wouldn't be able to psychologically stand. He'd watched two of his crew, his friends or maybe even his family, die. He's watch- ing another one die. He knows there's no chance of rescue, because the military is here and his people aren't going to be able to get to him. \"God only knows how far away from home he was, and he knew he was never going to see — if they have loved ones — his loved ones again. He was totally alone on a hostile planet, and the only people who were showing him kindness were being run off by the military at weapon-point. \"As a kid, I was aware of what being afraid of the dark was like, and the feel- ing I got from him was that feeling multiplied a million times. It was scary. It was terrifying.\" Soldiers on the Scene Anderson says he lost sight of the creature as the soldiers swarmed over the site. The civilians were brusquely shoved from the craft. Anderson remembers shouts and threats. His un- cle Ted threw a punch at one of the MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 275 March 1991"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Gerald F. Anderson Photo courtesy of Springfield News-Leader GIs. \"Things got very tense, very dangerous,\" Anderson says. \"The soldiers ushered us out of there very unceremoniously. Their attitude, to describe it at best, was uncivilized.\" Anderson has an especially vivid memory of a tough-talking red-haired Army captain and an equally gruff black sergeant. \"They told my dad and my uncle, who also worked at Sandia, that if they were ever to divulge anything about this — it was a secret military aircraft, they said — then us kids would be taken away and they'd never see us again.\" It seems an outrageous threat in hindsight, Anderson concedes. But at the time, he reminds, \"These people had machine guns and you listened to what they said.\" Another recollection strikes Ander- son as odd today: The soldiers didn't appear surprised about the other- worldly craft and creatures. They didn't gawk, slack-jawed and awestruck, as the Andersons had done. \"The soldiers weren't saying, 'Gee, look at that!' They were very cognizant of what they were looking at. They knew what it was.\" And it soon became apparent, Anderson says, that the Army knew what it wanted to do with the find. \"There was a battalion of military, a real invasion force, when we got back up on the hilltop. There were trucks, there were airplanes — they had the road blocked off and they were landing on it. They had radio com- munications gear set up. There were ambulances, and more soldiers with weapons.\" In the days that followed, all of New Mexico was abuzz with talk of strange lights in the sky, strange echos on radar, strange doings in the desert. On July 7, news reports told of remnants of an unidentified aircraft found by a rancher near the town of Roswell, NM, about 150 miles east of the hillside where the Andersons stumbled upon the saucer. Although several witnesses said it was like nothing they'd ever seen before, military officers insisted the metallic pieces came from an ordinary weather balloon ... Two Discs Forty-three years later, Anderson smiles wryly when reminded of the Ar- my's pronouncement. \"A lot of people wondered why, if it was just a weather balloon, the military put the pieces under armed guard and flew them in a B-29 to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio,\" he observes. Anderson believes the wreckage scat- tered near Roswell and the barely damaged saucer on the Plains of San Agustin are connected. \"There was a gash in the side of the disc we saw, like it had been crushed in,\" he says. \"The contour of the craft would fit into that gash perfectly — like another one of these things had hit it. I think two of these discs had a mid-air collision. One exploded and fell in pieces near Roswell, and the other crash-landed where we found it.\" With all evidence confiscated and the military steadfastly sticking by the weather balloon explanation, the story faded from the news by July's end. And Gerald Anderson says he tucked away the memory as he grew into manhood. \"I learned you just don't go up to the average person on the street and say, \"Damn, know what I saw?\" The guy will go, 'Get away from me, fool! Are you crazy?' That's exactly the first thing they will say to you: 'You are crazy!' \" In later life, he didn't mention it even to his wife until a few years after their marriage. Anderson joined the Navy in the late 1950s and served a dozen years in posts around the globe. He lived for a few MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 275 March 1991"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"around the globe. He lived for a few years in Colorado, working as a paramedic and working toward a col- lege degree in microbiology. In 1979, he moved to Missouri to better raise his daughter away from what he terms the \"druggy\" atmosphere of Denver. In ad- dition to his law enforcement posts, Anderson has worked for two southwest Missouri trucking firms as a driver and instructor. Anderson also has been active in the Episcopal Church. He recently was elected to the vestry at Ascension Episcopal in Springfield and is study- ing toward becoming a deacon. A gold crucifix — a cross complete with a figure of the martyred Christ affixed to it — suspended from a chain around Anderson's neck is testimony to his faith. No Conflict Although he concedes his account might make some fellow churchgoers uncomfortable, Anderson sees no con- flict between what he saw with his eyes and what he believes in his heart: \"When you're talking about the concept of God, you have to be talking in the context of a universal situation, a dei- ty that built the whole universe. And Friedman Finds Favor why should we assume that this speck of sand in the backwater of space would be the only place that an all-perfect, almighty God could create life?\" In fact, Anderson says he \"wouldn't be one bit surprised to find out that, wherever this creature came from, there they have a very strong concept of a supreme being. Because my contact with the creature showed a high degree of civilized sophistication, gentleness, compassion — all of the things we hold as ideals.\" Of the five Anderson men who ven- tured into the desert that day in 1947, only Gerald is still alive. Age, illness and accidents claimed the other four in recent years. But not only Andersons were at the scene, Gerald says, and he hopes his decision to come forth, albeit be 1 ted, will encourage others to tell what they know and spur official revela- tions about the captured craft and creatures. \"I want to see the government stand up and say, 'Look, we're not alone in the universe,' Let's make a 'Star Trek' really happen. Let's do go out there and explore the universe. That may be our only salvation. Because with what we're doing to this Earth, we're not going to make it much past the year 2000.\" TESTIMONY SUPPORTED Mike O'Brien Physicist Stanton Friedman serves MUFON as Director of Special In- vestigations on the Board of Direc- tors, Provincial Director for the Atlan- tic Provinces, Canada and as a Con- sultant in Nuclear Physics. What sets Gerald Anderson apart from the thousands of other Americans, including scores of Ozarkers, who say they've seen UFOs or even insist they've been kidnapped by creatures from outer space? Why are Gerald Anderson's child- hood recollections stirring international interest among UFO researchers whose reputations have been built on healthy skepticism and willingness to debunk hoaxes? Because of little things he has to say and how he says them. Stanton Friedman, a nuclear physicist who has lectured on more than 600 col- lege campuses about UFOs, describes Anderson as \"a really significant, potentially the most important\" witness to what both men believe was the after- math of one of two spacecraft crashes in New Mexico in mid-summer 1947. Friedman is co-authoring a book based upon several years of painstak- ing investigation into the haunting mystery. He was startled, upon meeting Anderson for the first time only a few months ago, to hear the Springfieldian echo details of the yet-to-be-published research. \"There's no way he could know some of these things unless he had been there at the time,\" Friedman believes. Example: Only days before first talk- ing with Anderson, Friedman coaxed a heretofore reluctant New Mexico mortician into recounting a run-in he'd had in 1947 with an especially unplea- sant red-headed Army captain who was heading up a team recovering bodies from a hush-hush aircraft crash. Ander- son, too, spoke of a red-headed captain with a mean disposition. Friedman says the descriptions of the ornery officer provided by the two match precisely, although Anderson and the mortician never have met. In sketches of the desert crash scene drawn by Anderson in Springfield following hypnosis, a lonely windmill appears in the distance. When Fried- man later arranged for Anderson to return to New Mexico to pinpoint the long-ago crash site, no such windmill could be seen on the horizon — until, almost by accident, the windmill was spotted behind trees that had grown up during the 43 years since Anderson was last there. \"I got shivers over that one,\", says John Carpenter, who has extensively debriefed Anderson over the past four months and went along on Anderson's return trip to New Mexico in October. Carpenter holds degrees in psychology and psychiatric social work from DePauw and Washington universities, and trained in clinical hypnosis at the Menninger Institute. He's in his 12th year of work at a psychiatric hospital facility in Springfield. \"When Gerald tells his story, it's not just a story — it's his life he's telling you, intermixed with his feelings and his beliefs and all that is Gerald,\" Carpenter says. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 275 March 1991"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"\"When someone is spinning a hoax or tale, they only give you enough to raise your curiosity. Not Gerald. He gives you everything, in detail, much more that you ask for. He'd be setting himself up to be found out if it wasn't true. He's so confident, he goes so much further than a hoaxer would ever dare.\" Carpenter puts great stock in Ander- son's recountings under hypnosis. \"It's what he didn't say that was significant,\" Carpenter says, explaining that despite clever prodding, Anderson never com- mitted a hoaxer's mistake of \"recalling\" something that shouldn't be part of his own memory. \"And when he's under hypnosis, all the bigger, adult words drop out when he describes events from his child- hood,\" Carpenter found. \"He relates what he saw in childlike terms.\" Carpenter also detected \"genuine amazement\" when Anderson heard what had been dredged from his sub- conscious memory under hypnosis. \"The look on his face was priceless when he realized he'd produced details he'd forgotten on a conscious level so long ago.\" Most subtle but perhaps most telling, in Carpenter's view, was Anderson's reaction to being accepted as a viable witness to an extraordinary encounter with a spacecraft and creatures from beyond Earth. \"He was so grateful at being taken seriously. You could see the relief and release after all those years, and the great hope that other people would take him seriously, too, once and for all.\" Ironically, Friedman points to Gallup Poll results indicating that 60 percent of Americans who have college degrees say they believe UFOs are real. With such a receptive constituency, why would government officials persist in what Friedman calls the \"Cosmic Watergate\" — the coverup and denial of the New Mexico crashes? Perhaps, some speculate, because it would be too embarrassing now to admit that some supposedly made-in-USA technologies actually were plagiarized from con- fiscated spacecraft. Friedman emphasizes that he's not as Continued on page 9 Hypnosis RELIVING JULY 5, 1947 John Carpenter, MSW/ACSW \"They were up ahead, and they started yelling ... there's this thing ... it's like a crashed airplane or something ... There's all kinds oftore- up stuff, uh, like uh, cardboard and wood, and stuff like that ... I was scared. He said there was dead peo- ple over there ... they don't look real ... There's all kinds of, uh, uh, lights inside the hole in this thing, and they're flashing... there's all kinds of neat stuff in here ... And then, Glen grabs Vic- tor by the leg and pulls him off, and tells him to don't mess around, because he could make it explode and kill every- body ... That doll or that funny thing — the one just by me — / reached and touched it, and it was cold ... It's got big eyes... abig head... it doesn't have lips ... four real long fingers ... they are like little kids ... about my age.\" Spoken by a 49-year-old gentleman named Gerald Anderson, these words are selected excerpts from a hypnotic regression session conducted on September 4, 1990 as he relived \"the day after all the fireworks,\" July 5, 1947. Gerald Anderson was just three months shy of being six years old. Most peo- ple would find it difficult to remember one particular day so many years ago. However, few people are ever likely to experience what Gerald did on that day — which would haunt his family for years. It was memorable that on only his se- cond day in New Mexico he was ex- periencing his first excursion into the intense heat of a vast desert while feel- ing ill from a chocolate soda. It was memorable in that he saw a large metallic disc wedged into the desert ter- rain that provided cool shade. It was memorable because he saw four \"doll- like\" beings — one of which was mov- ing and looking back at him! It was memorable when he thought he saw Harry Truman drive up — on- ly to realize that it was just a man who looked and dressed like him (Grady Barnett). And it was most memorable when a large number of military per- sonnel — America's heroes for children of that era — arrived on the scene. Shocked, however, by the abrasive demands and threats to his family at gunpoint, these \"heroes\" seemed more like evil villains instead. This unex- pected behavior produced a traumatic reaction that would leave young Gerald with scary nightmares for many weeks. If most of us had had that many memorable events and perplexing im- ages in one day's time, we would pro- bably remember that day as well. It is not unusual in the mental health profession to find people traumatized as children, who can recall details from four, five or six years old, related to those vivid events. Because this was a shared experience with other family members, discussions of the event throughout the rest of his youth would serve to preserve many of the details. For example, the name Armstrong (the nasty-tempered, red-haired captain) was easier to remember because of the sharp contrast with \"Jack Armstrong — all-American boy.\" Gerald chuckles when describing how neighborhood bullies would back off when he and his brother would threaten them with a visit from their \"little friends from Mars,\" because the kids had heard the adults discuss it and treat the event as real. As an adult, Gerald found that his July 5th recollections were met with ridicule, laughter and disbelief. He found it much easier to just tuck it away in the background of his life. Even after he impulsively called the \"Unsolved Mysteries\" toll-free number to correct their story regarding a few details, he MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 275 March 1991"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"was reluctant to talk to any UFO reseacher — even Stanton Friedman — until he could verify the researcher's credibility and professionalism. Recent- ly, he refused to meet with the national TV program \"Hard Copy.\" Gerald dislikes sensationalism; this story is part of his life, and he hopes for respect and sincere interest — not attention or personal gain. When we met for the hypnosis ses- sion — along with assistant Vincent Serencko (a MUFON investigator with military background), Gerald was skep- tical of hypnosis itself — doubting that it could produce anything additional to his conscious recollections. Not only was he amazed at retrieving details he had forgotten, but he was sincerely grateful and relieved that we weren't laughing at him as others had. (This was largely reminiscent of the emo- tional relief abductees demonstrate after revealing very private encounters and guarded emotional secrets to accepting, non-judgmental ears.) I tape-recorded an hour of conscious recall to obtain a clear idea of what gaps or uncertainties might exist. I could also then compare the description and vocabulary from an adult's perspective with that of the child's perception under hypnosis. As a child, he immediately began to recall the unpleasant physical sensations from feeling ill, drinking a chocolate soda, and riding in their 1940 Plymouth on a bumpy, rutted road in- to the open desert. He even developed a sweat from re-experiencing the in- tense heat. Efforts to lead him or sug- gest different responses failed con- sistently. Efforts to elicit responses to \"why\" questions failed. He did not at- tempt to explain, speculate, or \"fill in the blanks\" when they occurred. Many details emerged as we helped him relive all that he could see, hear, smell, feel or touch. This process has always been useful in stimulating recall. Most of us can recall the feeling of a dream slipping away from us as we awaken in the morning and how dif- ficult it is to attempt to hang onto it con- sciously. However, during the day one may experience a cue of some kind that can trigger the dream to return to one's conscious mind. This is the same type of recall stimulation that can occur dur- ing a trance state. How he would remember details in child-like terms also made sense: (1) \"horse tail flapping in the breeze\" = a bundle of fine wires; (2) \"pink chalk scribblings\" = hieroglyphic symbols; (3) Uncle Ted yelling at Victor that if he broke his ankle, he wasn't going to carry him back = Victor trying to snap a lightweight beam (unsuccessfully) by stomping on it, etc. I also noted his breathing became sharper and quicker when recalling the creatures. Perhaps most striking of all his details are those of the alien beings because of the precise words and feel- ings he chose which are so hauntingly similar to what I hear so frequently from abductees. (He states he has not re ' any books on abductions.) Efforts to trick or mislead him again failed. I especially liked his efforts as a child to describe an apparent telepathic ex- perience: \"It just seemed like if you got near them, it was like they were inside your head or something. It was like you couldn't think - like something was in your head thinking for you ... that one was staring right at me.\" Immediately following the two-hour session I had Gerald make several drawings — including a map of the ter- rain with all the features he had ran- domly mentioned. Because of the specific arrangement of these features, I find it very difficult to imagine anyone being able to create the map features and have it match the actual terrain of the vast New Mexican landscape by chance! Our trip to investigate the alleged site proved the map to indeed be a genuine depiction of real terrain with the features existing where they were sup- posed to be. A hoax theory might be that Gerald had visited the site recent- ly and memorized certain visible details. However, there are two pro- blems with that idea. First of all, Gerald clearly has not had the financial means to make the long trip there and back. Of greater significance is the fact that the windmill which was casually noticed on the horizon while under hypnosis can- not be seen today while at the crash site. To know that an old windmill is even in existence, one has to get per- mission to pass through a rancher's combination-locked gate and then drive toward his house on his private drive before one can even catch a glimpse of the old windmill, obscured behind trees that have grown up to conceal it over 43 years. And it's exactly where it is supposed to be on Gerald's map drawn in Springfield, Missouri. While in the crash site vicinity, Gerald described his recollection to two local women of the motherly woman who nurtured ill Gerald with a chocolate soda at a little store. They both recognized and identified that woman and her store with no difficul- ty. A respected mortician that Stanton Friedman had interviewed privately just prior to his first contact with Gerald described a visit by two military men — a nasty-tempered, red-haired captain and a black sergeant (both seen by Gerald at the crash site and rather un- forgettable due to their abrasive manner). Gerald had also described the ar- cheology professor, \"Doc\" Buskirk, as a big man with a round, gentle face and ruddy complexion. Recently, Stanton re-established contact with a source (name withheld) in the field of ar- cheology whom he had dealt with years ago. This source had known an ar- cheology teacher by the name of Buskirk in Albuquerque who was described as a big, rather shy man with a round face and a ruddy complexion. Stan's same source had been on the Plains of San Agustin himself in Oc- tober of 1947, looking for possible dig sites when a local cowboy approached him and told of a saucer crash with bodies on the ground several months earlier. He had also, reportedly, run into a document clerk at Los Alamos who claimed to have seen a document on that crash and those bodies. A local Postmistress and several ranchers have all reported remembering the saucer crash on the Plains of San Agustin. There are other promising leads for more information at the present time.

Verification of Gerald's involvement comes in a letter sent directly from his cousin, a Roman Catholic nun, in Col- orado to Stanton Friedman in Canada. She states: \"My family has been plagued by this incident for years and it is far beyond time that such should stop. Why Gerald would wish to reopen this is completely beyond me ... My father (Uncle Ted) was obsessed with this unearthly horror and kept several journals to prevent others from getting to them ... wreckage and debris from the crash ... out there near the caves ...\" Stanton also managed to track down a stepsister that Gerald had confided in, but then lost contact with for 33 years. She remembered the incident, but very few details. Stanton Friedman and Don Berliner shall be putting forth a book on these saucer crashes in New Mex- ico later this year. Recently, Gerald borrowed a sophisticated police identification kit to produce photo-like composites of five key figures from that memorable day in 1947. He has urged Stanton to show these to other witnesses because he is certain that they will recognize the faces. Hopefully, \"Unsolved Mysteries\" will display these composites in a nationally- televised update on their Roswell story that they could run in the fall. I have observed and listened to Gerald closely. Whenever he recounts his story, the details do not change or expand. He never elaborates or tries to answer ques- tions for which he has no information. He displays a great interest and hope for more data to come forth from others. He is grateful for the warm support and respect from his church, friends and co- workers. They know him! Skeptics shall shoot darts from afar; those who have listened closely to Gerald have experienced his sincerity, sensitivity, intelligence and candor.

This is a tale of at least two cities, and probably more. The reports and data are presented in the order in which we received them initially, then rear- ranged sequentially, and finally presented with some comments and speculation about this sequence. When numerous crop circle reports first began coming out of the Canadian prairie Provinces, ufologists here in British Columbia, on the Pacific coast, wondered whether we, too, would get to see any of this circular action. Manitoba and Saskatchewan had most of the reports, Alberta had thus far been overlooked completely, and since B. C. didn't have much in the way of grain crops to begin with, our own chances looked slim. Besides, the season was nearly over. Finally, one associate, in a combina- tion of frustration and dedication, decided to visit Sakatchewan and in- vestigate the circles there in person. The rest of us waited. It was not a long wait. As it turned out, though, we never did get any crop circles. Instead, we got rings. And a spot. Here, Spot! In the last week of August 1990, after dealing with a flurry of local UFO reports in the Vancouver area, we received a call from a Mr. D. M. 1 in Campbell River, B.C., on Vancouver Island. He and his seven-year-old daughter had had an unusual ex- perience, and he wondered if perhaps we at UFO-BC might be able to explain it. He didn't particularly associate the incident with UFOs, but still thought we might be able to provide some sort of answer as to what he and his daughter had witnessed. The previous evening they had been walking down a very quiet street in a residential area of Campbell River. Behaving in a fashion typical for her age, M's daughter was walking backwards as they were talking. She suddenly called his attention to something approaching them from behind on the sidewalk. This something was a bright, deep-red spot of light, perfectly circular and roughly four inches in diameter. They both instinctively looked up to see where this spot of light might be coming from. There were no airplanes, r.c helicopters, nor anything else in the sky. They looked around the neighbor- hood for other possible sources for this light, but could not find any. The streets were deserted, no noticeable lights were on in the houses in the area, and there was no visible beam coming off the spot of light. The spot quickly passed by them, crossed the sidewalk in front of them, traversed the grass off to their right, and went up onto the side of the nearby house. It then performed ran- dom movements and patterns for a time, and next proceeded to the end of the wall. It disappeared when it reached the edge, only to reappear, moving across some laundry hanging on a line in the yard of the house, and then it vanished. Throughout its maneuvering, the spot never varied in size, and maintained its perfectly round shape, without distortion. Unbroken Circles? On the morning of October 16, 1990, Ralph Thomsen left his farm house near Dawson Creek, only to be confronted by a large circular ring of dead grass in his lawn. It was quite near the house and had not been there the previous day. The damaged portion of the ring was exactly six inches wide, and the ring diameter was precisely 31 feet. The grass in the ring was flattened, brown, and very dead, while the grass both inside and outside was apparently unaf- fected. What Mr. Thomsen found stranger still was the discovery of eight or nine partial rings near the primary ring, all similarly affected. Two of these partial rings, if completed, would have formed a tangent with the complete ring. Mr. Thomsen has lived on this pro- perty for over 40 years. He had never seen anything like this before, and he tried in vain to come up with a common-sense explanation for these markings. After exhausting all pos- sibilities, he contacted the media. Since crop circle reports from the prairies were now both commonplace and newsworthy, a TV film crew was sent to the site. Measurements were again taken, confirming that the previous ones made by Mr. Thomsen and others were accurate, and that the ring was indeed a perfect circle. Williams Lake At about 5:00 p.m. on September 1, 1990 in Williams Lake, B.C., Mrs. Marian Marcotte went out into her yard to call her dog for supper. She called, but the dog did not come. This was unusual, but Mrs. Marcotte thought lit- tle of it and returned to the house. While she was cleaning and washing windows, she noticed a peculiar in- terference on the TV set. The house is on a cable system, and although they occasionally experienced some \"snow,\" this was different. It was described as a herringbone-pattern, and typical of electromagnetic interference, such as might be caused by automobile ignition. At approximately 7:20 p.m., Mrs. Marcotte returned to the yard to again call her dog, but she was still nowhere to be found. What Mrs. Marcotte did find, however, was a large ring in her driveway which had not been there the last time she was out. It was a very large ring, pressed into the hard dirt and gravel of the driveway only 12 feet from MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 275 March 1991"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Somehow, in the previous hour and 20 minutes, a ring had formed in her yard, in broad daylight. 1 *•!:>-• •.\"\"*•*\"*;C: : \"^J•;•'.'. . •' \"•'\"\"\"v.*''; The Marcotte's Strange September Circle her window — the very window she had been washing earlier. Somehow, in the previous hour and 20 minutes, a ring had formed in her yard, in broad daylight, while she had been working nearby. She had heard nothing. The ring was exactly six inches wide, just like the Dawson Creek ring, but with a diameter of exactly 39 feet. The circular impression etched in the yard was about one inch deep, and the ex- posed soil beneath was still damp. Some of the rocks in the ring were pulverized, crushed to a powder, and others were pressed flush into the ground. These could be pried out of the ground and then placed back into their respective holes, like fitting pieces in- to a jigsaw puzzle. Some of the rocks had scrape or scuff marks, and a residue on them resembling aluminum or some other metal. A considerable amount of dirt was displaced from the ring. The overall appearance of the area was as if someone had turned a huge drinking glass upside down, pressed the rim firmly into the ground, and then twisted it just slightly. The ring was 12 feet from the win- dow of the house, and 12 feet from an embankment directly across from the window. It was also positioned 20 feet from an embankment to the left, and 20 feet from a truck parked off to the right, which had not been moved in several weeks. With all the spacious, available area around the Marcotte's house, the ring chose to center itself perfectly in the limited area of the yard. Apple Snatchers At 4:10 a.m. that morning, Mr. Holland Marcotte arose and noticed a red glow over his son's yard next door. The son was out of town at the time, so any activity in the yard would have caught his attention. He called his wife, and together, through a very light fog, they saw a huge cone of red light, about seventy-five feet wide at the top, hover- ing over an apple tree in the son's yard. The light remained over the yard for ap- proximately 20 minutes, then slowly moved away. Mr. Marcotte wanted to go investigate right then, but his wife made a comment-regarding his sanity. They waited until daylight. When they investigated the next day, they found no evidence that anything untoward had taken place in the yard: no marks of any kind on the ground, no broken branches or twigs, no foot- prints. No evidence, that is, except for one thing — every single apple on the tree was gone. The previous day the tree had been home to between 75 and 100 apples. Now, there were none. There were no stray apples on the ground, no broken twigs or stems, and no apparent damage to the tree of any kind. It simply looked as if the tree had been very carefully picked clean. Sequelae The Marcotte's dog could be called a fearless animal, since it never hesitates to react when people approach the house. The only thing that ever frightens her is an approaching thunderstorm. However, she hid dur- ing the time the ring in the yard was formed, and would not readily go near the ring for two days thereafter. The Marcottes took several photos: two immediately after the ring was discovered on September 1, and more two days later, in bright daylight. The first two photos have a reddish hue or cast to them that was not noticeable to the eye. None of the subsequent photos show any such effect, nor does the video footage which was taken. The morning after these incidents oc- curred, Mrs. Marcotte awoke with a severe nosebleed, something she had experienced only once before in her life. This condition 2 persisted for well over three weeks. A physician examined her, stated that there was severe nasal irritation, but could offer no cause for the condition. Once the nosebleeds stopped, they did not return. There is absolutely no reason to suspect, nor any evidence to support, any kind of nasal (or other bodily) intrusion. The apple tree is apparently doing just fine, and has gone dormant for the winter. We wish it well, and are anx- iously anticipating its performance next season. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 275 March 1991"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Condensed Campbell There is no physical evidence in the Campbell River case, just witness testimony. While it is possible that a laser of some sort could have caused the wayward red spot seen by the witnesses, it seems unlikely in this case. The spot did not change in size or distort at all. The spot was seen on the ground, a wall, and on clothing perpendicular to the wall, i.e., on three different planes. If this were being projected by someone unseen, they would had to have been ex- ceptionally fleet of foot. It should be noted that Campbell River area has a long history of UFO activity, producing several good reports in the last two years alone. Also, the well-known McRoberts' photograph of a Daylight Disc, so ably analyzed by Dr. Richard Raines 3 , was taken near here in 1981. In the Williams Lake case, we are slightly more fortunate in that we have at least photographic and video records of the physical evidence. Unfortunate- ly, this report came to our attention six weeks after the event. During this time there was heavy flooding in the area, followed by an unusually early snowfall, which all but effectively erased the ring. There is, however, a remote possibility that some of the rocks with possible residue on them may still be located. Many visitors to the ring site had mentioned seeing UFOs in the area in the previous weeks. These were des- cribed as \"bouncing white lights\" over a nearby mountain, and were seen by Mrs. Marcotte as well. Williams Lake also produced two Close Encounter reports in 1989, one with physiological effects. Nematodes From Space 4 In the Dawson Creek case, we were able to secure both soil and vegetation samples for analysis immediately after the event. These samples were sent to laboratories in Vancouver for analysis. Submitted at the same time were soil and grain samples retrieved from a classic crop circle in Alvena, Saskat- chewan. The results of the analyses so far are interesting but inconclusive, and The Marcotte Circle and Huge Cone of Red Light over the Apple Tree near Williams Lake, B.C. have brought forth some of that jour- nalistic levity so loved by ufologists - this section heading, for example. Nothing was found in the Dawson Creek samples that could logically have caused the ring. There was no trace of fungi, herbicides, petrochemicals, etc., but there was a very high nematode count. The control samples from both inside and outside the ring returned a nematode count of 500, while the sam- ples of the damaged area returned a count of 4,200 — more than eight times higher. While this seems to be a signifi- cant difference, it is within normal parameters, although at the extreme high end. As one scientist said of this result, it is \"unusual, but not unnatural.\" There are two points of particular in- terest here. One is the fact that the samples taken from the Saskatchewan crop circles, and the samples from the Dawson Creek ring returned identical nematode counts, in both the affected and control samples., Alvena is more than 600 miles from Dawson Creek; the soil is different, and the crop being grown was wheat, not lawn grass. That the nematode counts should be identical is worth noting. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 275 March 1991"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The second point of interest is that it is certain that the ring in Dawson Creek was formed less then 24 hours prior to its discovery. It is not known whether the nematode population could bloom to this extent naturally in so short a time or not. There was no known UFO activity in the area at this time, but there have been a few reports from the Dawson Creek area in the recent past. It's a Wrap Is there anything we can make of this sequence of events? There does seem to be a pattern here, and there are a few interesting facts to be noted. To summarize, then, we have, in se- quential order, the following: A small red spot of light is seen moving around on the ground and walls in Campbell River. One week later, 200 miles north- east in Williams Lake, a ring is pressed into a family's yard; animal reactions and TV interference are noted. Later that evening, a huge cone of red light is sighted in the next yard, and apples completely vanish off a tree - one of the witnesses suffers physiological effects. Six weeks later, 250 miles north- northeast in Dawson Creek, a ring and partial rings of flattened and dead grass are found in a farmer's yard. To condense this still further, we have this pattern: a red spot of light, a red cone of light and a ring trace, and a ring trace. It appears that some particular cycle of events has been played out within the geopolitical borders of British Columbia. The Canadian crop circle reports of 1990 began with an event in St. Fran- cois Xavier, Manitoba, and then effec- tively moved westward. The British Col- umbia events related here basically went the other direction: they began in the southwest corner of the Province and moved northeast to the Alberta border. The cities in question do not quite fall on a straight line, but come very close to it. Williams Lake would be almost the midpoint of a line drawn from Campbell River to Dawson Creek. If these three sites are connected by straight lines, the resulting figure is nearly an isosceles triangle. Ring and partial rings found at Dawson Creek by Ralph Thompson in his yard on October 16, 1990. Whatever force was involved in the Dawson Creek and Alvena cases was powerful enough to flatten and kill grass, to flatten and swirl wheat, and yet did not harm the microscopic residents of the soil underneath. Feet vs. Meters The measurements of the trace marks worked out very nice and even in stan- dard measure, i.e., six inches, 39 feet, etc. Whatever agency or mechanism caused these rings evidently has not yet converted to the metric system as Canada has (mostly). When the press reported on these events, all the measurements were given their metric equivalents. Invariably, these were \"in- finidecimally\" awkward numbers. And. of all the possible locations for events, consider the similarities of the names of the sites: Campbell River, Williams Lake and Dawson Creek. Three surnames. River, Lake and Creek. Interesting, to be sure, but is it significance or coincidence? So just what exactly is going on here? Our lawns are getting squashed, our grain fields are being used as sketch pads, and now our apples are vanishing. We have absolutely no idea how these effects are generated, or by whom or what, and we certainly don't know why. Could there be an EBE out there somewhere, chuckling telepathically to itself, with a dish of Strawberry Ice Cream in one hand, and an apple in the other? One really has to wonder. And I didn't even mention all that shredded wheat. Tfie author would like to thank Paul Anderson, Chad Deetken and Martyn Stubbs for their assistance in these investigations. Notes 1.

Diagnosis and treatment is not a part of the committee's charter. It has been found that a significant number of UFO reports contain infor- mation suggesting that human physio- logical and psychological damage, animal reactions, and physical trace ef- fects are caused by close encounters with UFOs. While this assertion is generally accepted as true by witnesses and investigators alike, it may be found lacking as a body of data because of a ni'mber of external factors such as: lack of an operating protocol, failure to col- lect important data, fear of ridicule, and inadequate analysis of data. It is be- lieved that the medical committee can bring the right expertise to bear on this problem and provide an extremely useful service to this field. Membership on the committee will be limited to MUFON members who are medical professionals such as physi- cians, surgeons, radiologists, physio- logists, psychiatrists, nurses, etc. The committee will be administered by the MUFON Deputy Director for Administration.

He is the author of scientific papers on polymers and colloids, and is a consultant for the Mutual UFO Network. The phenomenon of crop circles, which has appeared practically world- wide, should be treated as a legitimate subject for serious scientific inquiry. It has been established beyond reasonable doubt that at least some of these circles, especially the very complex figures, cannot be hoaxes. Anecdotal information from an arti- cle in the Mufon UFO Journal for December 1990, suggests that there are electrical effects in crop circles which persist for some time after formation of the circle. An observer, Pat Delgado, reported feeling a \"conical field\" about his body. At the same time, his entry into the circle produced audio noise, a warbling note, in the headphones of a technician who was video-taping the area. The magnetic head of a video camera refused to record when located inside the circle, although the tape ad- vanced. Later, this camera was found to be \"totally ruined\" and had to be completely rebuilt. It seems that there is an opportunity here to acquire some hard data at the next genuine formation of a crop pattern. As a matter of routine, radioactivity measurements should be made inside the formation with a Geiger counter, although high background radiation would not contribute to the above men- tioned effects. Still, it will be interesting to see if the counter functions abnor- mally. It is essential that magnetic and electric fields in the formation (if any) should be mapped out by a qualified physicist or electrical engineer. Static magnetic fields cannot be sensed by humans although electric fields can be (hair raising, tingling sensations, etc.). The effect on the magnetic head might be attributed to the presence of a magnetic field. The writer is not knowledgeable enough in this area to know whether an electric field would have any effect. When this experiment is repeated one must be absolutely cer- tain that the video camera brought in- to the formation is initially in perfect working order. There is a problem with persistence of electrostatic effects; any net charge would leak away in minutes or less because of the appreciable conductivi- ty of moist soil and moisture-laden plants. It is also difficult to explain residual magnetism (if any) because of the chemical nature of ambient plants and soil. Electric Dipoles Permanent electric fields can be pro- duced in the absence of net electric charge by electric dipoles. An electric dipole consists of two equal charges of opposite sign (net charge zero due to can- cellation) constrained to remain at a fixed distance from one another. The product of charge separation by charge magnitude is known as the dipole moment. For example, an uncharged molecule, which cannot migrate in an electric field, can nevertheless have a dipole moment if its centers of positive and negative 1 ^ charge do not coincide. Such a molecule has its own electric field, which interacts with applied external fields so as to align the line joining its centers of charge with the direction of the applied field. While this alignment is ordinarily opposed by random thermal motions, considerable alignment can occur if the externally ap- plied field is strong enough. Materials which have molecular dipole moments can also be non-conductors of electricity (insulators). By polymerizing or crystallizing such materials in a strong electric field, the electrostatic analogue of a permanent magnet can be produc- ed (called an \"Electret\"), since the fields of the aligned dipoles reinforce each other and become locked into place. There is a permanent electrostatic field in the vicinity of such an object. It is interesting to note that the stalks of bent-over plants in these formations are aligned in some preferred direction. By some as yet unknown mechanism, electret domains may have been pro- duced in these stalks, even though the plants aren't good insulators. The lat- ter circumstance is only a hindrance to electret formation because of reduction in strength of the applied electric field, but may not inhibit it completely. If this is the case, the stalks themselves should be the loci of an experimentally observ- able electric field. However, one would expect that this field would decay more or less rapidly with time because of disorientation of imperfect electret do- mains. It is absolutely essential to make measurements on a fresh formation. The production of audio noise as some- one walked into a formation implies the radiation of electromagnetic waves by varying an electric field. A word about magnetism. The ultimate magnet is the spinning electron. When an electric cur- rent circulates in a loop, a magnetic field is produced perpendicular to the plane of the loop. Thus (with apologies to quantum mechanics) a spinning elec- tron is a tiny magnet. If two electrons occupy the same orbital they are re- quired ~to have spins of opposed sign and no resultant magnetic dipole is pro- duced. Atoms of iron, cobalt, etc., con- tain odd (unpaired) electrons and thus have magnetic moments which, via complexities of interatomic forces, for- mation of magnetic domains, etc., form permanent magnets where the magnetic Continued on page 23 MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 275 March 1991"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The UFO Press The Crop Circle Enigma, edited by Ralph Noyes Gateway Books, UK, 192 pp., 68 color pictures, $24.95 Reviewed by Dennis Stacy This may be the best book written about the Crop Circle phenomenon yet. (The two titles thus far from English researchers Pat Delgado and Colin An- drews, for example, are not so much written, as pictured.) The best book, of course, which we still await, would convincingly and irrevocably explain what Crop Circles are, how they form and what, if anything, they mean on their own, in connection with UFOs, or in relation to other anomalous for- tean phenomena. In its place we have a whole house- hold of contributors here, 12 total, in- cluding photographer Busty Taylor, who rarely share space in the same room for more than a moment or two at most. That they appear under one roof at all is testimony to the handiwork of editor Ralph Noyes and his publisher, Gateway Books, who could have cashed in on the inordinate amount of publicity suddenly surrounding the subject (and here's hoping they have, by the way) by taking the low road and the low road only. Instead, they've managed to fashion an excellently produced volume that never once skimps on charts, photo- graphs or text. It may appear relative- ly short and straightforward at less than 200 pages, but thanks to tiny, legible typeface, Noyes and Gateway have ac- tually managed to cram two small books between the covers of one, in- cluding an index in the process. Some of the contributing names won't be familiar to American readers, but the great majority of them belong to the recently formed Centre for Crop Circle Studies, which, aside from its multidisciplinary approach to the sub- ject (Enigma is subtitled: \"Grounding the Phenomenon in Science, Culture and Metaphysics\"), hopes to serve as a clearing house and peacemaker among the various individuals and groups now engaged in Circles research. Conspicuous by their absence are Delgado and Andrews, who were busy collaborating on their second book, The Latest Evidence, at the time Enigma was going to press. Meteorologist Terence Meaden is here, however, the Oxford-trained physicist who proposes that the Circles are caused by a previously unrecog- nized plasma-vortex, along with John Michell and George Wingfield, who, it goes almost without saying, adopt somewhat radically opposed views to Meaden's. Hilary Evans, a frequent contributor to these pages, weighs in with a piece about how anomalies are approached by society, while Robert Rickard, co-editor of Fortean Times, looks at the history of folk and related lore surrounding mysterious field-rings. Both of these latter articles, slightly revised, in fact appeared in a special issue of FT, No. 53, devoted to Crop Circles. At least two other contributors, Richard Andrews and Lucy Pringle, look at the Circles from an intuitive personal point of view, Andrews as a dowser who claims to be able to an- ticipate where some Circles will fall, and Pringle as one who is interested in interactive \"healing\" energies. There is, in short, something for almost everyone between the covers of Enigma, from channelers, ley line and other earth energy enthusiasts, to the students of those ancient symbols and artifacts that seemingly bear a curious correspondence to the patterns (or pic- tograms) carved out of today's cereal crops.

Many changes have taken place in post-WWII agriculture, in terms of both types and technology. Are such advances relevant or not? (In short, if the Centre for Crop Circle Studies doesn't yet have an agriculturist in its employ, they should \"hire\" one immediately.) Yet this holistic, encyclopedic ap- proach to Crop Circles is not quite so loose as I might have made it sound. For one thing, there are those incon- trovertible color plates spread through- out Enigma, predominantly contributed by Busty Taylor; for another, there is Noyes' own running commentary, crus- ty and caustic, which tends to keep the subject in relatively clear focus, and rarely fails to chastise researchers when needed, primarily for a reluctance to share, publish or otherwise make readi- ly available the sort of hard data that will allow and enable laymen and scien- tists alike to make up their minds about this mystery. In the absence of unam- biguous evidence, rumor, speculation and unfalsifiable theories have no op- tion but to procreate and multiply. On one level, cereology is a modern microcosm of the best and worst of ufology, itself but a reflection of similar \"anomalous-ologies\" that have gone before and are no doubt to follow. In- dividuals approach a core phenomenon, and in their attempt to make sense of same, address it in perhaps the only way possible — with their preexisting sensitivities, perceptions, biases and learned knowledge intact. On another level, such attitudes are needed and necessary. Informed opin- ion, after all, is always welcome. The flipside of this approach occurs, unfor- tunately, when a peripheral expert then tries to force-fit the phenomenon into whichever pigeonhole he or she bears in hand. It may be, with the Circles, as with UFOs, that everyone involved has to surrender something, even if that proves to be his or her own pet theory. There were numerous occasions on reading through Engima when I felt my intellectual gorge rising. Metaphysical- ly, I don't mind whether the Circles are all things to all people or not, as long as those parties involved realize that, most often than not, what they actual- ly see in a Circle is but a 360 degree reflection of their own thinking. Unlike other current books on the Circles, which belabor an individual Pretty Pictures point of view, Noyes and Enigma have at least attempted to shatter the mirror. If there is something here to please everyone, then there is also something bound to offend everyone.

CROP CIRCLES: THE LATEST EVIDENCE By Pat Delgado & Colin Andrews Bloomsbury, London, 1990, 80 pages Quality softcover, $13.95 Reviewed by Jerold R. Johnson One of the salient features of the whole crop formation business is the seasonal, cyclic nature of it all: the new circles and pictograms are discovered, measured, photographed, all in the few months that the field crops are grow- ing to maturity, then they disappear as the crops are harvested. Circle watchers then have several months to hold con- ferences, argue among themselves, and publish papers, until the cycle starts over again in the summer following. The latest cycle produced a crop of \"circle\" books, all published in the UK and now slowly appearing in North American bookshops. Included among them is this slender volume from Pat Delgado (engineer) and Colin Andrews (engineer), authors of the stunningly il- lustrated and fairly informative Circular Evidence (Bloomsbury, London, 1989). In fact, Crop Circles: The Latest Evidence is a softcover update to their previous book, adding some 50 color photographs and brief explanatory text, but assuming throughout that the reader is already familiar with the phenome- non and \"sold\" on the reasons by which it is recognized as a real mystery wor- thy of international scientific study, and not just the artistic expression of a small army of trespassing hoaxers, or wind damage. The reader is often referred back to some information in the first book, as Delgado and Andrews jump right into an incident-by-incident reporting format, depicting each one of their latest cases. Pictograms They begin the book with some 1989 circle finds not reported in Circular Evidence, and include an anomalous sound case which was detected and recorded on video tape within one of the flattened areas of crop. We then follow the authors through the remarkable 1990 summer season as one new design after another appears, forc- ing Delgado and Andrews to abandon \"circles\" and adopt \"pictogram\" to describe the often complex combina- tions of shapes: rectangles, triangles, arcs and even block letters at one point (though prank was not clearly eliminated in this instance due to the hasty destruction of the words by a harvesting machine), spelling out \"we are not alone.\" It's almost as if the \"intelligence\" behind this phenomenon has either read Dr. Meaden over the winter and wants to take the wind out of his vortex theory, or else it has tired of the various puns on the word \"circle\" used as titles for books and magazine articles, and so has decided to vary the pattern. In any case, the 1990 designs are ap- pealing on several levels: as art objects MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 275 March 1991"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"strikingly out of place in the mono- tonous tractor-lined agricultural fields, as a mystery of execution and forma- tion to be solved, as a message to be deciphered and understood, even as a form of grafitti on the blank wall of southern England, to be either admired or despised, depending upon the mind- set of the observer. The photographs, all color, at once ap- peal to the appreciative senses and the analytical mind, and make the book a valuable addendum to Circular Evidence. Besides the photography, the authors of Crop Circles: The Latest Evidence have included at the end a catalog of plan- views, executed as line drawings, of 18 pictograms, and an area map showing their locations. Though lacking scale, this inclusion is a definite plus for the reader trying to make some sense out of the pat- terns. The more serious researcher may still be frustrated in that few of the oc- curences include the date of the find, other than \"1990,\" and it is unclear if they are even presented in chronological order (a point that will no-doubt be important to the cryptology buffs). Skeptics among us may point out that there is scant mention of the role of pranks and hoaxes; and the embarass- ing incident that occurred during \"Operation Blackbird\" (where pranksters stomped out a remarkably large and elaborate pictogram under the noses of assembled investigators equip- ped with infrared cameras and para- bolic microphones) is left to \"... be written about.. at a later date\" (p. 65). W e also note the essential ab- sence of any new eyewitness accounts of flying objects or lights associated with the crop mark- ings, a feature recorded repeatedly in the previous book, either because such observations did not occur in 1989-90, or perhaps because of a not-so-subtle shift of the authors' perspective from that expected of a pair of electro- mechanical engineers to one of a more mystical nature. It is this mysticism, in- cluding references to spiritualism (p. 9 and 78), dowsing (p. 78), ouija boards (p. 29), and a pervasive \"we know something more about this business ^\"X £%'^! than you are ready to be told\" attitude of both authors that takes this update volume on a path away from the objec- tive track of its predecessor. Pat Delgado, in his cryptic chapter, \"Theories Update,\" appears to rely on \"revealed knowledge\" as opposed to any field observations or deductions based on documented evidence, especially when he describes an \"... 'awareness,' which became apparent to me in 1988,\" of how the \"... mechanics of the manipulation\" which forms these pictograms operates. Yet, he teases: \"Only the mechanics of the manipula- tion will be described here. What the energy is and who controls it will be explained at a time considered to be more fitting.\" (p. 79). Where have we read phrases like that before?! The \"two-part function\" Delgado goes on to elucidate fails as a satisfying explana- tion for anything. Perhaps the time is indeed just not fitting. A major disappointment of Crop Circles: The Latest Evidence was the \"evidence\" offered as a plant sample analysis. In the earlier book, much was made of the particular way the plant stems were apparently softened and bent over in truly anomalous cases, as oppos- ed to the crushing and breaking that characterize the hoax cases. It was stated that plant samples, both affected and con- trol, were to be collected and analyzed at appropriate laboratories. Every reader assumed that Delgado and Andrews meant some agricultural or botanical research laboratory employing profes- sional scientists, and that the best tools and methods of modern science would be brought to bear on this effort. We eagerly awaited the results, ex- pecting at minimum some photomicro- graphy showing elongation and contrac- tion of cells compared to the alteration or damage to cells, vessels and other structures in stems of plants bent down Continued on page 23 MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 275 March 1991"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Looking Back Bob Gribble March 1951 • A flat object \"of a blinding white color\" was seen at Corcelles-Neuchatel, Switzerland, at 4 p.m. on the 12th. Witnesses included Professor Alfred Lombard, his family, and several other persons. The object followed a large course across the sky leaving a white and woolly smoke trail as it progressed with sudden leaps for- ward. After 15 minutes of maneuver- ing, the object turned upside-down, ap- pearing as a perfect disc. It then took off vertically, at a fantastic speed, emit- ting no smoke or noise, and was out of sight in an instant. (UFOs: A History, 1951, Loren Gross) • Mr. George Floate, the Chief Aerial Engineer of the Delhi Air Club, along with his two assistants, 20 mechanics and helpers, observed a UFO over Sadarjang Airport, New Delhi, India, about 10:20 a.m. on the 15th. The ob- ject was shaped like a cigar with no outer control surfaces. It was about 100 feet long and as big around as a C-47 fuselage, with a bare metal color. Floate estimated the speed to be about three times greater than the cruising speed of a British Vampire. The craft maneuvered over the area for seven minutes. At one point the object \"jumped\" like a frightened cat when jet fighters of the Indian Air Force were headed its way. The \"leap\" took the craft 2000 feet higher in an instant. (UFOs: A History, 1951) 1956 • At 9:17 p.m. on the 26th, a strange blip suddenly appeared on the radar scopes at Westover Air Force Base, Massachusetts. Jets were scrambled, then vectored toward the circling UFO. The pilot of the lead in- terceptor closed in on the round object, near enough to illuminate it with his landing lights. The strange craft ap- peared to be 100 to 150 feet in diameter, and eight to 12 feet thick at the center. The pilot noted a green fluorescent glow around the outer edge. As he tried to get closer, the glowing disc climbed steeply, then disappeared. (Flying Saucers: Top Secret, Maj. Donald Keyhoe) 1961 • Jacksonville, Florida Mayor Haydon Burns had a spine-chilling near-miss with a UFO over Fort Pierce at 9:45 p.m. on the 22nd. The Mayor, who had an almost legendary reputa- tion for dealing strictly with the real and practical, revealed his harrowing ex- perience with great reluctance. With him were his secretary, William Y. White, and the pilot George Nikita. \"We saw this thing ahead of us, right in the airlane, but about 500 feet higher. We were traveling at 4000,\" the Mayor said. \"We watched it for six or seven minutes. At first it looked like a real bright star. As we grew closer it took on much greater dimension. \"The light was most intense. Almost like looking into a direct light bulb. We saw no image because the light was so blinding. I think we scared it away. As we approached, the light increased in intensity, then decreased and increased again. Then it rose at an accelerated rate, something in the vicinity of 300 to 400 miles per hour. The object ascended immediately from 8000 to near 20,000 feet. At first it had been standing absolutely still.\" The pilot of an Eastern Airlines plane northbound from Miami also saw and reported the object to Air Traffic Control. Dozens of witnesses also observed the object from the ground. One amateur astronomer, who watched the object with powerful binoculars, said he could see a brightly-lit cabin in the object. (News-Tribune, Fort Pierce, FL, 3/23,26/61) 1966 • A UFO landed in a swamp in Dexter Township, Michigan about 8:30 p.m. on the 20th. Frank Manner, 45, said that he saw bright lights com- ing from the swamp at the back of his farm and awakened his son Ronald, 19. The two of them proceeded into the swamp and Ronald said to his father, \"What is that thing?\" Manner said that as he looked in the direction his son was pointing, the lights went out and re- appeared in an instant across the swamp, a distance of about 1500 feet away. At this point, they said, the object became illuminated from a brilliant source of light which flowed horizontally between two smaller lights. The brighter light in- tensified, then went out. The Manners said at this point that a \"whistle\" similar to the sound of a rifle bullet ricochet was heard and the object lifted and passed directly over them. They said the craft was brown in color with the outside appearing quilted. It was flat on the bottom and was cone-shaped toward the top. Two sheriffs deputies said they saw eerie blinking lights, apparently on a flying object, rise above the trees, then dip again in Webster Township. Dexter Patrolman Robert Honeywell said one of the objects passed over his car as he and other officers rushed to the scene. Chelsea police also reported similar sightings. Many residents in the area reported that a large number of animals, including dogs, cows, chickens and wild geese, had been frightened by something in the area that night. (The Press, Ypsilanti, MI, 3/21,22/66) • Charles Cozens, 13, said two strange \"ships\" landed in a field behind a police station at Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, on the 29th. Charles said he ran behind a fence at 9:15 p.m., to the open grade behind the police station after seeing one \"ship\" come down, closely fol- lowed by another. He described the craft as \"eight feet long, four feet wide and three feet high\" with \"red, blue and green lights set into the rim and flicker- ing like a computer.\" Charles said the objects \"lit up the grass around\" and were making \"a buzzing sound.\" He said they were hard and smooth to the touch and \"I could not feel hot or cold so they must have been about body temperature.\" MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 275 March 1991"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Charles said one object had an antenna. \"It was thicker at the base and narrowed to the size of a nickel at the top.\" When he touched the antenna he received an electric shock and a three-foot flash \"of electricity\" occurred.

Police Constable Arnold Read, summoned to the boy's home after his parents had repeatedly questioned their son before reporting the incident, verified Charles had a three-inch yellowish burn mark on his hand. Mr. Cozens said he questioned and re-questioned his son and explained the seriousness of calling the police \"but Charles was emphatic and could not be shaken.\" • On the same night and about 200 miles to the southwest, Mrs. Mary Mat- tatall said she observed a \"huge round thing with a bluish gassy haze around it.\" Mrs. Mattatall, a nurses' aide at Windsor, Ontario, was on her way to work when she spotted the craft above her house at around 10:50 p.m. She said the vehicle seemed to swoop down towards her house and at one point seemed as if it was going to hit the house. Then it \"whirled\" away to the east in the direction of Belle River. An hour later, a large disc-shaped craft was seen hovering about 700 feet above Westminister Hospital at Lon- don, Ontario, about 120 miles northeast of Windsor and about 80 miles south- west of Hamilton. John Lewis, 58, sighted the craft at 11:50 p.m. and watched it for five minutes, \"shining with a white light.\" He said the disc, about 35 feet wide, was motionless when he first saw it, and he heard no noise. The disc was domed in the center. As he watched, the disc flipped into a vertical position, and ascended into the clouds. His story was backed up by Glen Roberts who also observed a \"white object\" over the hospital for five minutes. (The Spectator Hamilton, Ont. 4/2/66; The News, Wallaceburg, Ont. 3/31/66; The Evening Free Press, London, Ont. 3/30/66) 1971 • Hartley Weston, 36, a veteran bush pilot, had flown supplies to a mineral exploration camp 150 miles to the north and was returning to his base at Pickle Lake, Ontario, Canada — about 225 miles northeast of Kenora, on Ontario Secondary Highway 599. \"It had been a routine flight, but sudden- ly off my left wing I saw a very bright flash,\" said Weston. It was nearly after- noon (date unknown), and he thought it was just another plane. \"But as I watched, this bright flash got increas- ingly bigger and bigger and then grew to some unbelievable proportions. I just watched as it came up to me and seemed to cover the whole horizon. \"I was paralyzed with fright. I didn't know what it was. I didn't know what to do. It was coming at me, and I thought it was going to ram me. There was no way I could get out of its way. But then it seemed to just stop in the air in front of me. I was stunned. It ap- peared to just sit there in front of me, yet I didn't come any closer to it. That was the oddest part about it. It was just like everything stopped. It was un- believably huge, like a silver-colored rocket with short reddish-gray flames coming out the back and followed by a contrail. There were no windows, no openings. It was perfectly smooth in ap- pearance.\" The object gave off a flash of blue light, off and on, like someone switch- ing a light off and on. It hurt Weston's eyes. \"I swear I hung there, too. I didn't realize it at the time but I don't think I was moving. It was such a queer sen- sation. I had time to study the thing. I'm a licensed engineer, and I looked for details, anything, but there was nothing.\" Weston didn't know how long he watched the vehicle. \"I was so stun- ned by it all. And all of a sudden it started to move again, off to my right, and it disappeared the same way it came, just a sudden flash and it was gone.\" Then Weston discovered his plane was going down. \"It suddenly dawned on me that the engine wasn't running, and I was down to about 1000 feet. I started looking for a place to land. I had started turning toward a lake when the engine started again with a terrible roar. That was the most frightening part. I just about came out of the seat. This whole thing left a deep impression on me. It makes you feel rather humble and insignificant. You're sitting there in your iron bird and this thing comes along and takes a peek at you. You know you've been had. There's nothing you can do about it.\" (The Examiner & News, Battle Creek, MI, 11/30/81) 1976 • Some 50 astonished CB radio fens filled the airways with descriptions of a gigantic UFO for four hours as it danced across a 50-square-mile border area of Virginia and Maryland on the 13th. One after the other, as the object approached the radio operators, all 23 channels on their Citizens Band radios were knocked out by an eerie noise. But as the craft moved away, their CB radios began working again. The first in a series of sightings was made at 9:15 p.m. by Brian Brawner, 18, of Bruns- wick, Maryland. Brawner was badly frightened as the huge, brightly-lit vehi- cle soared swiftly toward him. \"It was so low I thought it was going to hit my car,\" he said. \"As it flew by, my CB radio was filled with weird static, like I'd never heard before. \"Throughout the night, CBers would report that the object was near them. Suddenly they would stop broadcasting, then when it left they would come back on the air and say their radio had been dead while the thing was nearby. When the thing passed over me ... I could see it was round, with a peak in the center. It had a bright white light and some red lights. I really felt strange, being that close to it. It hovered in the air a little while, then flew away so fast that I couldn't see it.\" John Jacobs, 32, of Brunswick said, \"I turned on my CB set about 10 p.m. and heard every- one talking about it. An hour later, I spotted it. It had stopped dead still in the air, for about 15 minutes. It made me feel small and more or less bewil- dered.\" Robert Jackson saw the massive UFO hanging over the Potomac River. \"It was really huge.

Dear Editor: I was amused (as many French ufologists undoubtedly will be) to read that Jean-Pierre Petit was presented in the January 1991 issue of your magazine as a \"Director of the CNRS,\" a very prestigious job indeed. In reality Petit is one of a very large number (in the hundreds) of CNRS employees who bear the title \"Direc- tor of Research.\" He has no staff and no independent research budget. Petit is doing UFO work in his own spare time, like most people. This is a little like getting the Presi- dent of the United States Baton Twirl- ing Federation confused with the Presi- dent of the United States! Naturally, when it comes to UFOs, Petit is entitled to his own theories, as long as he does not misrepresent his of- ficial position. At last report, the Direc- tor of the CNRS is still Professor Kourilsky, a biologist. — Jacques Vallee San Francisco, CA Dear Editor: Jaime Shandera's article about his in- terview with General Thomas J. DuBose (January 1990) actually creates more questions than it answers. Since our view is different than his, and General DuBose is quoted by both of us, there is obviously something wrong here. Can we both be accurate in our reporting of what DuBose said? And if we are, then how can pur conclusion be so different? The problem is probably centered on what exactly was on Brigadier General Roger Ramey's floor. We maintain that it was the remains of a balloon and a target device, while Shandera and Bill Moore claim it was the actual Roswell debris. Originally Moore had written that Marcel said if he was in the pic- ture, it was the real debris and if it was anyone else, it was the weather device. We believe that none of the pictures, in- cluding those of Marcel, show the real debris. Therefore, there was not a switch of debris on the floor. It was always the weather device. The other problem is that Shandera has confused two separate events. In one, DuBose has real debris from Roswell brought to Fort Worth on July 6, 1947. That debris, taken by Brazel to the sheriffs office in Roswell, was sealed \"in a suitable container\" (the mail pouch) and then sent on to Washington, D.C. It was that debris that was hand-carried to General Clements McMullen by Colonel Alan D. Clark. The second flight, two days later which brought Marcel to Fort Worth, was when the weather balloon story evolved. (Contrary to Shandera's claim, DuBose told us that during the August 1990 interview.) In his article, Shandera also suggests that Warrant Officer (later Major) Irv- ing Newton has changed his story. He was so sure of this, he didn't bother to interview Major Newton. But, in a review of what Major Newton told Bill Moore in The Roswell Incident, it clearly shows that his story is virtually the same as that reported by us. In fact, the differences between Moore's version and ours is the \"spin\" put on the words. Moore claims that Newton was briefed by a colonel who told him the general wanted him to identify the material as a balloon. Newton told us that he was briefed by a colonel who told him, \"Some officers in Roswell think they found a flying disc. The general thinks it's a weather balloon and would like you to identify it.\" A slightly different interpretation of the colonel's briefing. And, when we first interviewed Newton, he was ada- mant about it. All he ever saw was the Rawin target device. That is the debris shown on the floor in Ramey's office. Shandera, in his enthusiasm to ridicule our work, attacks us again for saying there were only five photos taken in Ramey's office on July 8. We have explained that the number in our original article was changed, by the editors, without our knowledge. In our article in the November/December issue of the IUR, we corrected that to show the seven that have been discovered. And, in reviewing, with J. Bond Johnson, the sequence of events, Johnson, said that he'd taken four pic- tures, rather than two as he originally claimed. Once again it comes down to who do you want to believe. Copies of our video taped interview with General DuBose are available at the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies, the Fund for the UFO Research, and later, MUFON. Copies of our audio taped interviews with Major Newton are available at the Center, and will be made available to MUFON. Are Jaime Shandera and Bill Moore willing to make copies of their interviews available to the same places so that disinterested third parties can review them? Maybe the best way to answer all the questions about what happened in Ramey's office is to simply ask, what do you think the pictures show: An in- terstellar craft that crashed, or the rem- nants of a rather flimsy target device? Doesn't the evidence, visible in the pic- tures, speak for itself? Doesn't that evidence, available for interpretation by all who are interested, suggest who is telling the most accurate version of the truth? We will be preparing a complete response to Shandera's article to include General Dubose's comments about the situation, and on the articles published containing his earlier remarks. Maybe then we can finally lay this aspect of the events around the Roswell crash to rest. Additionally, in the course of our in- vestigation, Shandera and Moore have accused us of \"lifting\" information from their published works with no credit given to them. Yet they refuse to acknowledge that we were the first to talk with Johnson, and that the Bettman Archives photo to which Shandera refers was obtained from us. — Kevin D. Randle Donald R.

Some experiments with heat, microwaves, magnetic fields or enzymes applied to the plants would seem in order, as would a complete chemical and biological assay. What the reader is offered on page 41, instead, are two photographs of unknown scale showing some crystallized, dried-up plant juices, and text informing us that \"... the energy pattern of the crystals produced by a distillation process from the plants in- side the circles was dramatically dif- ferent to that from control samples taken from plants in the same field.\" That's it, that's the analysis in a nut- shell. What skeptic could disagree with \"the energy pattern of the crystals\" in two photographs?! The authors, though crediting the owners of the \"only laboratories in the UK conducting such a test,\" seem reluctant to provide the name or the nature of these \"laboratories.\" A little research in another publication pro- duced the following: In Stroud the HSC (UK & Ireland) Limited Laboratory provides a special- ized service where crystalline structures from blood are analysed and crystal- line patterns of herbs can be matched to those of the patient. This is all part of the Spagyrik Process which is uni- que to each individual's needs and which has been successful in treating patients holistically. This process being one of 'energy medicine' was applied to the cereal crop from various circles with in- teresting results. From the photographs (see below) it is clear that there is a noticeable change in the energy patterns of the com from inside the circle to that of the control sample which was taken from the outside of the field. This is just an interim finding as ex- periments are still being carried out, and a report will be published later this year. The above is from \"Crop Circles - The Mystery Deepens,\" by Richard Beaumont, which appeared in Kindred Spirit. Volume 1, Number 12, page 36. The reader may decide if this represents an acceptable and pre- sentable standard for the technical analysis of this significant physical evidence of an anomalous phenomenon or not. Despite its shortcomings, the book is highly recommended for its photo- graphs alone, and should be collected as a companion volume to last season's Circular Evidence. We shall soon see if the authors feel obliged to produce additional update volumes as this phenomenon continues to grow and evolve. CIRCLES, Continued dipoles are aligned and locked into place. Chemical bonds between carbon atoms involve a pair of electrons shared between two atoms. Some organic (carbon-containing) substances have unpaired electrons. These substances (\"free radicals\") are usually very unstable, but a few are not. Even if a formation is found to be non-magnetic (as expected), an assay of unpaired electron content should be made by ESR (electron spin resonance) spec- troscopy using earth and plants far from the formation as control samples. It would seem premature, to say the least, to form any firm hypothesis as to the origin of crop formations until much more information about them is available. Hopefully, these recom- mendations will initiate steps in that direction.

Only Board of Directors may nominate candidates for this prestigious recognition. Anyone may nominate a person for the award by submitting the name of their candidate with a written paragraph stating his/her accomplish- ments to one of the Board of Directors. For the convenience of members, it is suggested that you write to your regional director; Donald M. Ware, George R. Coyne, Robert J. Gribble, Henry H. McKay for North America or J. An- tonio Huneeus, International Coor- dinator for foreign nominations. The actual contribution or work is not confined to the calendar year of 1990-91, but may include significant ac- complishments during the past five years. The Fund for UFO Research may again provide a $500 cash award in memory of Isabel Davis. Last year's recipient was Richard H. Hall. The deadline for receiving nominations from Board Members is April 26, 1991 in Seguin, Texas. A ballot will be enclosed with the May 1991 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal so all members and subscribers may vote for their choice from the candidates proposed. Please take time now to evaluate the work and contributions of your col- leagues in Ufology so they may be so honored for their dedication. One nomination has been received to date. New Officers Birch Pavelsky (Fairbanks) has been appointed to the post of Assistant State Director for Alaska, working with Mi- chael A. Lewis. Donald A. Johnson, Ph.D.. State Director for New Jersey, ap- pointed Dan S. DeSantis (Linwood) State Section Director for Atlantic Coun- ty and Tim Jones (Mt. Laurel) for Burl- ington County. Susan Van Slooten, Asst.
