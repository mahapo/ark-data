FROM THE EDITOR When grown men speak of babes, as they recently did in connection with the Rendlesham Forest Affair, it's time to take UFOs and UFO witnesses seriously. If you saw the recent CNN-TV four-part series on Rendlesham, you heard one of the American security officers involved in the affair say, in effect: \"They were like little children. That's what I kept thinking the whole time.\" What I keep thinking is that we've yet to hear the last out of England on this remarkable case. In the meantime, you'll find two articles about Rendlesham in this issue of the Journal. We also have the text of a speech delivered by Charles E. Barnum at the 1972 Midwest UFO Conference. Barnum was the editor of the Quincy, Illinois, \"Herald-Whig,\" and the recipient of the 1972 Wells Memorial Key Award presented by Sigma Dellta Chi, the professional journalism society. His was the keynote speech at the conference, but since it was not included in the annual Proceedings, we are reprinting it now because it is still as relevant as when it was first presented. We hope you enjoy the present issue of the Journal and look forward to your comments and criticisms. Coming up soon, pictures and an interview with Dr. J.

Kenneth Arnold, whose sighting initiated the modern era, died in January of last year, and ' on December 6th, after a lengthy illness, Gray Barker passed away in Charleston, West Virginia. A longtime devotee, publisher and writer of UFO and related material, Barker will probably be best remembered by his \"Saucerian\" magazine and the controversial book, They Knew Too Much About Flying Saucers. The latter recounted the exploits of UFO investigator Albert K. Bender and his allegations that he had been hushed up by \"three men in black,\" a theme which has since recurred in the writings of John Keel, among others, and firmly ensconced itself, for better or worse, in the modern UFO lexicon. Like Arnold, Barker was a legend in his own time and will be missed by his circle of friends. IFO RESEARCH On another front Hobart Gregory Baker writes to announce the formation and goals of the Center for Identified Flying Object Studies. Baker, a graduate in physiology from Ohio State, says the new organization is independent of other established UFO groups but will co-operate freely with both them and individual parties. Baker, director of the Center, says the organization \"will study the reliability of testimony of UFO and IFO observers, the factors that enhance, suppress and distort the testimony of UFO and IFO observers, and determine the similarities and differences of UFOs and IFOs.\" The Center will support a data base of sighting reports of both UFOs and IFOs upon which statistical analyses can be performed.

The following subject would not normally come up except that it is not every day one gets to attend a mutilation, as I was recently privileged, if that is the word, to. One of the most compelling factors of the animal mutilation mystery was the supposed absence of copious amounts of blood either at the mutilation site or in the carcass of the victimized animal itself. Where did the missing blood go? Was it drained through pencil-sized holes in the jugular vein by extraterrestrial vampires? Or was it extracted by terrestrial scientists conducting supersecret germ and/or genetic warfare experiments? There were other bodies of thought between the two extremes as well. This problem took on a less abstract and more concrete realism last December when an old friend, now a reporter with one of the major • Canadian dailies, and I vacationed in the Yucatan and Quintana Roo states of Mexico. December, of course, in Mexico is a month long celebration. Each community has its own Saint, time and mode of fiesta. In Isla Mujeres, where we were staying, the celebrations ran from the, first of December until the eighth, were devoted to the Virgin of the Immaculate Conception and culminated in a Sunday bullfight (the traditional bullfight season in Mexico is the middle of the summer). We had seen the crude ring of corrugated tin and sticks before, but now it was crowded with a mob of screaming spectators. We scrunched our way in and made it up to the second level, composed of a precarious, tree- limb floor. From here, I was able to expose a 36-frame roll of color slide film, using primarily a 35-105mm Zoom. At first we thought the bullfight was a sham, a comic fair to go hand in hand with the religious festivities of the week before. After all, the \"matadors\" were dressed in yellow rain-capes! Then suddenly the bull stood back, two bandilleras protruding from his right shoulder. Blood had been drawn and was plainly streaking down his flank. A young matador approached, surely less than fifteen. He fluorished a red cape in his hands, supported by a hidden sword. He plunged the sword in the bull's shoulder, aiming for the heart, but apparently missed. An older man finally made the kill with several stabs of his own sword. But the bullfight was only a mild prelude to what was to follow. As we made our way down and outside, the dead bull was roped .and drawn from the ring by its neck. It was deposited virtually at our feet and to our amazement two men set to butchering the carcass immediately. To my further amazement, they drew hardly any blood. Not that there were not visible amounts of blood, there were, rather there was not nearly as much as I might have expected. Each man had an approximately 10-inch long butcher knife and sharpening tool and another man later applied a hacksaw to some of the leg bones. The first cut, however, went from stern to stem of the bull's tender underbelly. With deft, short strokes.of -•their knives, the two peeled back the skin from both flanks. Now the bull was lying on its back, all four legs in the air, and a good yard of soft hide spread on either side for use as a butchering blanket. Underneath its skin the bull looked like some mutant albino. The second layer appeared to be a white sheath of subcutaneous fat that was almost (continued on page 19)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"ESTIMATE OF THE SITUATION Marge Christensen RESPECT In the October, 1984 issue of the MUFON Journal, editor Dennis Stacy, in his column, \"From the Editor,\" quoted Rodney Dangerfield in saying (regarding UFOIogists), \"We don't get no respect.\" If you think that UFOIogists \"don't get no respect,\" try public school teaching for awhile. It's no secret that public education in the U.S. is under fire from critics in every aspect of society. In fact, I often find that I get more respect when introduced as a UFOIogist, than when I am introduced as a teacher! Morale in teaching is so poor that the entire teaching staff of our school system has been instructed by the Supt. of Schools to list as our #1 goal for this year, that we will be positive. As simplistic a prescription as this sounds for combatting the forces of negativism, it is not such a bad idea. If one manages to maintain a positive outlook, it will enable him/her to keep sight of the fact that it is the students and the education process itself which are of prime importance, not the public regard for teachers. This stance, can only result in increased public, respect for educators. UFOIogists would do well to take a lesson from this analogy. If we can manage to be positive about the UFO subject, and our role in researching it and increasing public awareness of the phenomenon, we will then expend less of our valuable energies combatting biased, venomous dribble from the skeptics, and perhaps we will accomplish a great deal more constructive work in the field as a result. Our \"respect rating\" by the public would very likely rise a few points also. ' During the past months, many of us (notwithstanding this author) have tended to take note primarily of the negative side of the state of affairs in Marge Chn'sfensen (center) on the Speakers' Panel at the 1984 MUFON Symposium UFOlogy. Fortunately, in my fervor to be positive as a teacher, I recently unconsciously let some of that uncontrolled enthusiasm spill over into the UFOlogist side of me. The results were not only eye-opening, but quite heartening and very promising. Rather than risk being accused of a \"Polyanna attitude,\" I should mention that as your PR Director, I have a distinct advantage over most of you, and that is that I have established a very active and extensive communication system with several State Directors and Asst. State Directors, so I am able to view the operations of our mutual network from a comprehensive vantage point. While I have observed that it is true that apathy abounds among our membership, there are also clear indications that this situation is beginning to slowly give way to a new \"conscientious activism.\" The MUFON —Dennis Srocy National Newsletter has begun to bring about a much more active communications network and a great deal more active participation on the part of State Directors across the country. People who were previously simply names on a piece of paper are now communicating with one another and sharing information and providing mutual assistance. This has brought about a greater sense of cohesiveness in the organization, as well as a greater degree of efficiency in getting the job done. Also, there is a movement toward accountability and professionalism on the part of all'of us, and that movement is rapidly gaining momentum. Dan Wright, Michigan State Director, has compiled a comprehensive examin- ation for field investigators, and has invested a great deal of time and (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"SITUATION, CONTINUED thought into revising the exam to reflect input from consultants, State Directors, field investigators, and members who have responded to Dan's request for feedback. The overall reaction to initiating such an exam has been entirely favorable. This, in itself, is a clear indication of a widespread desire for upgrading our standards and preparedness. In an attempt to promote efforts to inform the public on the UFO subject, and to provide standardization for our various State organizations, Barry Greenwood, Dan Wright, and Tom Gates are currently compiling two slide presentations — one for the public, and one for training field investigator trainees — which will be made available to all MUFON State organizations at a minimal price in the very near future. ARCHIVES Attempts to better equip our State organizations do not stop there. At the 1984 MUFON UFO Symposium at San Antonio, TX, a proposal was presented for the establishment of regional UFO resource collection centers in order that the wealth of data in our possession be made more readily accessible to researchers. To date, two such regional centers have been established. Barry Greenwood, Massachusetts MUFON Asst. State Dir., has offered to serve as a regional collector, as has DougLabat, Louisiana State Director. A Massachusetts MUFON member is compiling an extensive computer file of- Barry's archives, which comprise one of the most extensive collections of UFO material in North America. The catalog, which already numbers hundreds of pages, will be made available to researchers immediately upon its completion, hopefully by the end of December, 1984. In addition, Massachusetts MUFON has purchased a tape cassette copying machine, and thus has the capability to reproduce audio tape cassettes in large numbers with relative ease. It will also be possible to reproduce other items such as videotapes and to make Xerox copies of paper items if so requested by researchers, as long as these materials are used for instructional purposes, and not for profit. The computer print-out (book) of resources, as well as any items to be reproduced will be available to interested researchers at minimal cost. It is further planned that Doug Labat's listings will eventually be added to the computer file, so that we will have a more complete listing of available materials. It is also hoped that other archivists will volunteer to-serve as regional collection centers. An additional cause for optimism about our current situation is that there are faily widespread indications of State organizations expressing a willingness to become actively involved in public education endeavors. At the San Antonio MUFON Symposium, it was announced that in mid-August, 1985, we will hold our first NATIONAL UFO INFORMATION WEEK, and will ask the participation of every State organization. In a recent questionnaire sent to all State Directors, each organization was asked about its potential preparedness to contribute in some way to such an endeavor. Twenty-one State Directors have responded to date. The following States have indicated a willingness to participate in at least three of the following projects: UFO display at shopping mall or county fairs; one-day UFO conference; press releases to newspapers; appearances on radio or television: North Carolina, Northern California, Southern California, Michigan, Nebraska, Utah, Iowa, Massachusetts, Maine, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, New Mexico, Texas, and Missouri. Additional projects suggested include seminars in schools; printed posters; one-day teach-in; speakers on college campuses; independent study project with academic credits for college students. UFO WEEK Furthermore, an important development in the preparation for the National UFO Information Week has been the desire of the Fund for UFO Research and the Center for UFO Studies to join us in this important effort. Dr. Bruce Maccabee has indicated that the Fund will handle all publicity in the Washington, D.C. area. Dr. J. Allen Hynek and Mr. John Timmerman of CUFOS have been extremely gracious in their offers to assist in this endeavor. Mr. Timmerman will be working on some public service announcements for radio stations, and Dr. Hynek is, hoping to put together a UFO documentary for television. This genuine spirit of cooperation among our three organizations has always existed, but it is particularly heartening to be able to work together on such a project and to see tangible results. It is our sincere belief and hope that with increased public awareness of the reality of the UFO phenomenon, it will be incumbent upon the media to offer more responsible, serious coverage of UFO news events. Also, it will be much more difficult for the govt. to withhold information from the public because the public will see through any half-baked debunking explanations of genuine UFO cases. The bottom line is that we will never know unless we make the effort. No one else is going to do it • for us. The important thing to note here is that we are going to make that effort in the summer of 1985, and that effort will be a group effort on the part of .numerous States. On an entirely different front, there is reason to be optimistic about the information we have been able to obtain from government agencies recently under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. It was recently learned, for example, that \"A UFO by any other name might result in document releases.\" A document received recently referred to sightings of unidentified flying objects as \"irregular sighting reports.\" Requests are already being filed for documents regarding \"ISRs.\" An additional document just received refers to the \"agency of the Air Force responsible for investigating UFO sightings.\" This opens still another door to requests for additional documents. The Citizens Against UFO Secrecy (CAUS) have revived their newsletter, \"Just Cause,\" and have begun making subscriptions available to persons who wish to (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"SITUATION, CONTINUED support their endeavors to file requests under the FOIA for additional documents. This organization warrants our support, and is getting a great deal accomplished in the area of government documents. The annual subscription fee for the CAUS Newsletter is $10, and should be sept to JUST CAUSE, Box 218, Coventry, CT 06238. Despite the negative aspects such as the dropouts from our ranks, the constant, unconstructive attacks from the ever-persistent fanatical skeptics, the relative dearth of media coverage on the UFO subject, and the petty squabbling among UFO organizations which sometimes occurs, there does appear to be a ray of optimism beginning to penetrate the cloud cover. OPTIMISM When one considers the various points of this article, in addition to the following summary of events of 1984, one gets a rather new and hopeful perspective of the estimate of our situation: 1984 SUMMARY 1) Congressional Research Service published The UFO Enigma, an amazingly accurate depiction of the UFO subject, even including a copy of the Kirtland AFB document. 2) Clear Intent was published, and sold out rapidly. The book is already into its fourth printing. 3) MUFON 1984 UFO Symposium in San Antonio was a smash hit with a greater financial profit than the previous 14 symposia combined. 4) UFO Forum in Beverly, MA, played to a standing-room only crowd, and will now become an annual event. 5) UFO Conference in Brewster, NY, attended by 1000 persons, most of whom were witnesses of the strange objects seen over NY and CT. Also, as a result of the conference, there was widespread media coverage of the subject. Marge Chnstensen Addresses San Antonio Symposium 6) The N. Y. Times published two pro- UFO articles, an unusual occurrence for that newspaper. 7) A new research institute was donated to the Center for UFO Studies, in Phoenix, Arizona, and this promises to herald a new era of meaningful research into the subject. 8) Closing ceremonies of the 1984 Summer Olympics included the landing of a giant UFO modeled after the one in the movie, \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind.\" This is indicative of the popularity of the UFO subject with the public. There are other positive events of 1984, but suffice.it to say that there is clear cause to believe that the current estimate of the situation is beginning to reflect a distinct hint of optimism. NEW ERA This may be only the beginning of an exciting new era in UFOlogy, only if we work to make it happen. Although the response we have had for the National UFO Information Week has been very positive to date, we still need —Dennis Sfacy the cooperation of those States yet unheard from. Those State organizations in which apathy dominates, need to do some self- assessment and attempt to get their acts together. The members of the Committee on Public Information and Public Education are prepared to provide assistance wherever possible. Specific regions of the U.S. are the responsibility of various members of the committee, and these persons will be in contact with the \"silent States\" in the near future. It is also up to you to help yourselves to a certain extent. If you haven't already done so, purchasing a copy of the 1984 MUFON Symposium Proceedings is a must. There are step by step instructions included for State Directors to use in getting their various organizations off the ground. Also, make use of the telephone. It tends to be a rather effective means of communication. In many cases, help is only a phone call away. Take advantage of low weekend rates. If everyone pulls his or her share of the job, we can effect a change in the situation in UFOlogy as mentioned (continued on page 19)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"EARTHLIGHTS REVIEWED Gregory D. Long A new school of thought is emerging in UFOlogical speculation. The school is attempting to explain UFOs as the product of geophysical processes 'that generate high-energy luminous balls of light at faults. These \"earth lights\" .seem to behave intelligently, which is spurious (these thinkers believe) since the \"intelligence\" behind them results either from common misperception, or even more, from reactions the lights make to some heretofore unknown \"psychic\" energy transmitted by the unwitting witnesses. Spokesmen for the school include M. Persinger and G. Lafreniere, authors of Space-Time Transients and Unusual Events (Nelson-Hall, New York, 1977); and Dr. William Brandy of the U.S. Bureau of Mines in Denver, who has demonstrated that quartz- bearing rock subjected to high pressure will, upon cracking, release shortlived balls of energy. Supposedly, if this electromagnetic phenomenon can occur in the laboratory, it can occur as well on the grand scale of nature. Persinger and Lafreniere suggest that these balls of energy can, in proximity to witnesses, stimulate the portion of the brain involved in deep-rooted archetypal imagery, sparking hallucinations and \"UFO experiences.\" Paul Deyereux, who lives in Great Britain, is the author of Earth Lights, subtitled Toiuards an Explanation of the UFO Enigma, the most ambitious attempt so far to develop a drum-tight explanation of UFOs as a form of ill- observed, although not so rare, form of electromagnetic energy produced through tectonic stress. Devereux differs from Persinger and Lafreniere in that he does not subscribe to the stimulus/hallucination principle of UFO sightings. Devereux agrees that UFOs originate from geophysical processes, but he also believes that the ancient Neolithic peoples of Britain knowingly erected megalithic stones (such as those of Stonehenge) at places in (continued on next page) — artwork by Simone Mendez"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"EARTHLIGHTS, CONTINUED Britain near UFO-producing faults. The shamans of the Neolithic tribes practiced an \"elemental technology,\" using a form of psychokinesis (PK) in which imagery of the mind interacted with the external energy-forms of nature. This interaction occurred, and apparently still does today — although . unconsciously — in the presence of psychically predisposed individuals because the UFO acts as \"a carrier of imagery,\" its substance accommodat- ing the form of the image. Devereux writes: The mental signals affecting some UFOs will, presumably, come from different levels of consciousness, and the intensify with which a UFO is likely to respond to such an input into its system will vary with a number of conditions — the proximity of the human \"transmitters,\" the phase of development in the UFO, its level of plasticity and stability at that phase, the 'ambient electromagnetic conditions, the strength of the PK, and so on. Devereux supplies an answer to why ancient stone sites were built (he believes more was involved than predicting astronomical events and erecting a large-scale calendar from stone). The interaction of mind with the . energy forms was \"an outward representation of.; profound - mental processes...\" These mental processes contained the ancient myths: Solar heroes, Earth Mothers, demons and giants — all the representations of the forces of physical and mental Nature may actually have taken on tenuous form in the ancient world. It is easy to understand how the vague, inchoate racial memories of this time have come to be misinterpreted in our day and age as references to ancient astronauts. In short, the ancient shamans knew how to \"activate the outer mechanisms (the earth lights) to present their inner visions.\" This powerful psi ability peaked 8 Paul Devereux, Author of EARTHLICHTS around the third millenium B.C., Devereux states, and fragments of The Knowledge exist today although the means of linking the consciousness with the physical world seem to be completely forgotten. However, contemporary UFO sightings are of \"shape-shifting\" earth lights that display \"the elements from the common cultural ethos....If the UFO pageant today resembles nothing more than the .incoherent ravings of a fevered mind, then that is the true reflection of our current collective mental situation.\" Simply expressed, the earth lights theory proposes a terrestrial source of UFOs, a \"profoundly sensitive energy form\" that can sustain a humanly transmitted mental image. Or as I would put it: We have met the UFO — and he is us...under our feet. All of this is heady stuff. One obvious problem with the theory is the place of apparently structured, metallic objects in the scheme—and especially those seen under daylight conditions by multiple witnesses. Devereux seems to think that the reports of daylight discs are of earth lights which take on a metallic appearance due to \"some refractive process\" or \"some kind of electrical 'sheen' effect.\" This appearance includes portholes, domes and the other \"craft\"-like appurtenances, such as antennae, common to many daylight objects. Additionally, Devereux is careful to choose only those sightings of nocturnal lights that could conceivably be taken as the product of earth stress — yet oddly, the selected cases have enough \"high strangeness\" about them, and the reported objects display such undeniably intelligent behavior, that it is hard to believe that we are dealing with a nonsentient form of energy that is either coincidentally behaving in an intelligent manner as a result of natural effects, or is somehow being shaped by the force of psychokinesis acting at a distance of miles in some cases. Despite this farfetched approach to explaining the rich variety of UFO appearances as reported by thousands of witnesses all over the world, Devereux does manage to present a compelling argument for the UFO-fault connection in Part 3 of the book: \"UFOs As Earth Phenomena.\" In this section, Devereux correlates stone sites, meteorological and seismic phenomena, the incidence of UFOs, (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"EARTHLIGHTS, CONTINUED alleged paranormal events and geological features of the landscape to arrive at convincing patterns that UFOs derive from faults and that the ancients may have known of their origin. Studying records of these events for England and Wales, Devereux graphically demonstrates strong correlation between all the components. As an example, he analyzes the strange lights observed in Barmouth from Christmas 1904 to July 1905, where \"The phenomena mainly took the form of lights of all colours, usually globular though sometimes in columnar form...\" During the sightings, a religious revival was taking place in the district. Devereux notes that in 1903 an earthquake occurred along the great Bala Fault which dominates the Barmouth area. Devereux wonders if \"electromagnetic elements accom- panying tectonic events may have triggered mental processes producing 'the contagious zeal (that the religious leader of the movement) was experiencing\" at the time? Devereux also notes that other prominent UFO \"window\" areas having faults, such as Warminster and Dyfed, have had reports of UFO sightings that suggest that the phenomena originate from the earth itself. For example, Cley Hill on the Warminster Fault is \"a generating and earthing point for the phenomena we call flying saucers or UFOs,\" he states. Naturally the Earth-Lights school must precisely describe the mechanisms of luminous-display production. How is it that the earth- lights sustain their form up to 15 minutes, or even hours at a time? How can the lights travel thousands of feet into the air? Why do the earth-lights approach energy sources such as vehicles and power lines, including animals and people? Devereux proposes \"energy fields\" around people that \"attract\" UFOs. But what are these fields? Can they be detected? How do'they attract earth-lights from thousands of feet away? It is nice to hypothesize \"personal energy fields,\" but what does the term really mean? Devereux asserts that some UFO \"entities\" are formed from the earth lights themselves, which may form from a columnar \"terrestrial discharge event\" mistaken by observers as a ghost or otherworldly being. If so, what do we do with all the detailed CEIII reports in which beings are directly associated with landed UFO \"craft\"? How does an earth-light divide itself up into several humanoids who scoop up soil samples and leap into their vehicle and speed away? How do we explain the rich details of humanoid appearance and behavior? CEIII witnesses must be either extremely stupid or mad. Devereux also never touches on the problem of the light characteristics of nocturnal UFOs. Why do some nighttime UFOs seem to undergo color transformations? Why is it that some witnesses report UFOs that seem to bear several different lights that blink and flash? Why do some nocturnal lights divide and reform? It is safe to predict that readers of Earth Lights will ask even more questions. Devereux has- directly challenged current thinking in the UFO field which still considers questions of the extraterrestrial or ultraterrestrial source of UFOs. Devereux has taken the time to seek correlations between geological events and lights that are undeniably real. The patterns do exist. But do they exist in nonfaulted areas of the world as well? And if the earth lights have always been with us, why has their presence been so little recognized until now? Has the observation and reporting of these lights been the result of a \"raised consciousness\" on the part of a public newly awakened to the natural world around it due to the expanisve spirit of the Space Age? If so, then sociologists and psychologists have a rich arena in which to explore the mechanisms of human perception and social knowledge because the general lack of reports of strange lights before the modern era of UFOs requires an explanation. Earth Lights is published by Turnstone .Press Limited, Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, England. PAUL DEVEREUX —Dennis Stacy"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"WHAT HAPPENED IN RENDLESHAM FOREST? A DRAMATIC tape recording, allegedly made by panic-stricken American servicemen during a close encounter with an alien space craft in a Suffolk forest, is authentic, their former base commander has exclusively told the EADT. The chilling 20-minute recording, a major new part of the evidence gathered by UFO investigators probing a claimed double landing in Rendlesham Forest, near Woodbridge airbase, was given to the researchers by former base commander Col. Sam Morgan. The EADT has traced Col. Morgan to the space com- mand headquarters linked to the Peterson Airbase, Colorado and in a frank transatlantic telephone con- versation he said, \"I do not think it is a hoax.\" The tape recording is due to be played at a London Press conference today to launch \"Sky Crash — A Cosmic Conspiracy,\" a book on the alleged incidents which took place on the nights of December 27 and 29/30, 1980. Frightened The incidents were first reported in the EADT and the book's authors, Dot Street, of Blackberry Way, Oulton Broad; Brenda Butler, of Mafeking Place, Leiston, and national UFO investiga- tor Jenny Rendles, claim there has been a conspiracy to cover up the truth about what happened. Col. Morgan told the EADT, \"I think the men really were out there that night and they saw something which frightened them. \"You can hear their excited conversations and references to frightening strange lights. The only opinion I have is, 10 that based on the evidence available, those guys definitely saw something which cannot be explained. Erased \"As for them fabricating it all and putting on an act, I do not think they could have pulled it off.\" He gave the tape, part of which had since been inadver- tently erased, to researchers because, \"There was no reason not to,\" added Col. Morgan. The recording was made during the second alleged Recording of UFO sighting 'not hoax' fled location\" and was un- available for comment. The book was written before the investigators heard Reports by John Grant close encounter by the then deputy base commander Lt. Col. Charles Halt. His report to the Ministry of Defence on both incidents gave the book's authors a major breakthrough when it was leaked. Stricken As previously reported by the EADT, it was the first time there had been official confirmation that unusual lights and objects had been seen, and traces of radiation had been found in imprints on the ground and on a tree at the site. Shouting In subsequent evidence given to the investigators, witnesses claimed that in the first encounter three silver- suited \"entities\" were seen repairing their stricken space craft and some witnesses claimed that contact was established with them. When his base in Oklahoma was contacted by the EADT, Col. Halt was said to be on duty at a \"classi- the Halt tape but they had heard from witnesses about passages in it. They claim it tells of a \"red, sun-like light\" which flies through the forest and silently ex- plodes into multiple coloured lights. A small craft, similar to the one in the first alleged en- counter, was seen on or close to the ground. Col. Halt and a small number of men with him quickly retreat amid panic and shouting. The book concludes that incidents undoubtedly did take place and puts forward several possible explana- tions if the UFO landing claims are untrue. Included among the authors' suggestions is the alleged possibility that the UFO story might be a blind to cover-up tests on weaponry which went wrong. Inquiry Or, they say, the Ameri- cans might even have recovered by helicopter part of the Russian satellite Cos- mos 749 under cover of dark- ness when it was accidentally dropped into the forest.

The Hah report was therefore sent to the Ministry of Defence and the matter was left to them to handle \"as they felt most appropriate.\" The USAF had no other course of action open to it beyond making the report available \"as a matter of courtesy.\" Any other action would nave been \"like sending out our cops to enforce British law,\" he said.

MEDIA & UFOS, CONTINUED an immediate story may be in order and should be reported by someone like Walt Andrus who is level-headed about the phenomenon. Other ways in which you,may aid the news media in keeping the public informed of UFO happenings include: 1. Providing interviews with recognized scientists like Dr. Hynek and Dr. Saunders. 2. Holding conferences such as this which pull together the views of experts in the field. 3. Making appearances before groups such as luncheon clubs, always making sure speakers provide reporters with adequate summaries of their remarks. 4. Releasing pictures of sightings if they tell a significant story. 5. Assisting reporters and editors in pulling together isolated reports and facts so that they may be presented in a total context possessing meaning. A good example here is the significance of the events in 1954 as pointed out by Jacques Vallee. These are some suggestions I leave with you in the hope that by obtaining your cooperation we in the news media can present a clearer picture of the UFO significance. Additionally, let me say that I'm sure you'll find news media representatives willing to give our field objective treatment if you'll make yourselves available for providing answers which newsmen may need to handle information about UFO's intelligently. As your so-called keynoter, I'm privileged to welcome you to Quincy, an open-minded city, a truly great city 'that welcomes new ideas and a city wherein scientific research in many fields has reached a high level of sophistication. Thus, the scientific trend in our exploration of UFO's will attract to its echo a warm welcome from all of us here to all of you. 12"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"UFOS & THE MEDIA Charles E. Barnum My good friend, Walt Andrus, asked me to discuss news media in relation to UFO sightings — and then bombshelled me by remarking, \"We'll call your talk the keynote speech.\" Inserting me as a keynoter in a scientifically oriented gathering such as this is much like asking a lifelong birdwatcher to deliver a paper at a meeting of NASA scientists on a subject such as: \"Location of the engine frame into an airplane's wing, just ahead of the leading edge of the wing, produces the greatest propulsive efficiency while maintaining the best aerodynamic results.\" Frankly, I'm here, as most of you are, to learn something; and hopefully to discover that the study of UFO phenomena may be off and running on a scientifically guided course. As a\" newspaperman whose skepticism is representative, I believe, of journalists generally, I have approached the problem of handling news of UFO sightings gingerly, even apprehensively. FEAR It's a scary subject; it requires mature handling. The Orson Welles broadcast in 1938 based on H.G. Wells' \"War of the Worlds\" seriously disturbed more than one million persons, many of them to the point of panic, according to a study conducted by Hadley Cantril. The story was told in the form of a newscast, but announcements were made before, during, and after the presentation stating it was a play based on Wells' novel about an invasion from Mars. And because \"humanoids\" are also involved in the UFO picture, editors and newsmen generally must develop ways of presenting reports of sightings which they receive so as not to 'cause uneasiness, or, indeed, fear. Thus, when I learned such a conference as you are now engaged in was contemplated here, I felt a sense of gratitude to the conference planners. We now have an opportunity to use conference 'materials as a basis for giving our readers a coherent, more comprehensive and authoritative look at the UFO experience. Additionally, such a conference has educational advantages for news media representatives, as well as others, to learn more about the UFO activity in the context of deliberate consideration and discussion, apart from emotional, even traumatic response to inexplicable strangeness. Such knowledge should enable all of us in media work to handle news of UFO activity more intelligently, and perhaps with less skepticism. Our need — and this arises somewhat from the fact we've been susceptible to stories arising from misperceptions—is to achieve perspective on the whole complex subject. Moreover, we need to be helped by better screening of reports reaching us, so that we can provide our readers a better, more coherent picture of what is happening on the UFO front. At least for several colleagues and myself, now that you are in town, a quote from Jack Taylor, of Missouri, seems apropos. He remarked about the new minister at his church: \"Our new pastor is doing a wonderful job. We didn't know what sin was until he came to town.\" I must acknowledge that as a skeptic I've had my skepticism blunted and my interest aroused by several books on UFO's and one book in particular. It is \"The UFO Experience, a Scientific Inquiry,\" by Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Chairman of the Department of Astronomy of Northwestern University, your 1970 Conference headliner. After reading Dr. Hynek's book and some other material on UFO's, I'm prepared to acknowledge, \"You're undoubtedly dealing with something that needs, not sniggering, but downright enlightened interest by the scientific community.\" And I might add, the something referred to needs our news media's careful attention and handling. UFO FOCUS I also will acknowledge, on the basis of a somewhat superficial survey, as I did not have available a wide assortment of papers, that some of us in the newspaper business have not done enough to bring proper focus on the UFO mystery. Bringing the UFO experience into a sharp focus entails much more than doing as we have generally done, reporting occasional sightings by individuals in our reading areas. Even Jesus realized that the folks at home do not a prophet recognize, that one becomes an expert only when he travels far from home. So it is with the credibility of sighters in their own backyards. Their neighbors, and their hometown editors, don't credit them with the qualities necessary for expert observation. In this connection, Dr. Hynek's suggested method of rating credibility makes a lot of sense'. The study I made of reports in the press of UFO sightings impressed me in the same way that reports of the late Senator Joseph McCarthy's charges did. As one read the McCarthy blasts— all isolated—one had a growing feeling of unease, and an undeniable fear that Communists were taking over the government. As each story unfolded, the nation experienced a nervous binge. What'was lacking in the McCarthy case was this: A blockbuster wrapup of the whole McCarthy story, pulling all facets together so that the country could get a look at the complete McCarthy case. If his charges were (continued on next page) 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"MEDIA & UFOS, CONTINUED solid, the wrap-up would have shown them to be so and would have made him a national hero. But when such a compilation was done by a press association, the McCarthy story exploded and he faded from the national scene. There was no documentation of his charges, and nothing was found to substantiate his statements. As for the UFO phenomenon, I consider the Dr. Hynek book an essential blockbuster wrap-up of the UFO story—pulling together all relevant facets and offering the route to a scientific appraisal of available data. The UFO story obviously is not going to explode, for Dr. Hynek shows that it has tremendous significance for us and our time, and possesses enough substance to warrant greatly accelerated scientific inquiry. It was impossible for me to trace a consistent pattern of UFO handling by the news media. I found that some UFO sighters concluded they had been treated too lightly in stories detailing their reports. For our part locally, I can say that both the electronic and print media have treated UFO stories as straight news events, never minimizing their importance, nor overinflating their significance, or casting aspersions on the persons involved. Also we have reported talks by your local spokesmen, particularly Walt Andrus, fully and accurately.' As I study available materials on UFO's, I have reached several conclusions which might be the same gained by other newsmen after studying the same documents. I cannot, of course, speak for any other newsman, but I can speak for myself. My skepticism, which incidentally never reached the point of negative reaction for I tried to be objectively skeptical (whatever that is), has given way to deep interest in the whole subject of UFO's. I credit this change of attitude principally to Dr. Hynek's book. While I was at Northwestern University teaching journalism, I kept abreast of this noted astronomer's activity, and I gained respect for him as a great scientist. So when he says in his 14 MUFON Director Walt Andrus. Jr., at 1984 Symposium —Dpnnfs Slacv book that it's his opinion \"that data that now lie scattered about, if properly processed, could establish the substantive nature of the UFO phenomenon beyond reasonable doubt,\" I believe him. He refers to these data as akin to low grade ore which must be processed and refined before it is of value. Let me quote him more extensively at this juncture in order for me to make a point. PITCH BLENDE Writing of this ore, he adds, \"Or perhaps a more appropriate analogy might be the case of Marie Curie and the tons of pitchblende that she had to process before they yielded a mite of radium. Those of us who have spent time on the UFO problem are convinced that the probability is very high that there is 'radium in the pitchblende' in the quantities of reports. Although it will be a Herculean task to cull and refine existing UFO data, I feel a rich reward awaits a person or a group that assumes this task with dedication. For if there is indeed 'pay dirt' in the ore of UFO data, it might well represent a scientific breakthrough of major magnitude. It might call for reassignment and rearrangement of many of our established concepts of the physical world, a far greater event than the rearrangements that were necessary when relativity and quantum mechanics demanded entrance into our formerly cozy picture of the world.\" Dr. Hynek, as you may know, concludes his book with these words: \"When the long awaited solution to the UFO problem comes, I believe that it will prove to be not merely the next small step in the march of science but a mighty and totally unexpected quantum jump.\" Now here is my point in quoting Dr. Hynek: Our news media have and will give space to comments like these coming from such an authoritative source. I cite you as an example the article on Dr. Hynek and his views in the Chicago Tribune Sunday magazine of June 4, 1972. The article interested me particularly because it opens with the following paragraphs and I quote them for a reason. Before reading thenv however, let me say that if support on a (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MEDIA & UFOS, CONTINUED massive scale is ever to be obtained to do the kind of research that Dr. Hynek, and obviously many of you, are interested in, then material like the magazine article will do much to establish credibility and authority for the project. HYNEK Now may I quote: . \"Hanging on the wall of Dr. J.Allen Hynek's office at Northwestern University is a framed cartoon. It shows a flying saucer parked on a college campus and five small creatures confronting a passerby. With antennae sprouting from their helmets and ray guns at their sides, they are asking, 'Could you direct us to that chemistry professor who called us 'swamp gas?\" \"It was Dr. Hynek — an astronomer, not a chemistry professor, who said that strange lights sighted near Ann Arbor, Mich., in 1966 were nothing more than swamp gases released by unseasonably warm weather. Despite his debunking of these sightings, Hynek is not ready to discount all reports of flying-saucers. He believes there is a possibility we are being visited by strange craft—and even 'little people'—from another planet. He believes that flying saucers or UFO's—unidentified flying objects— ,may be something more substantial than • mere hoaxes or the results of traumatic experiences. \"Dr. Hynek is an astronomer of impressive credentials,'a scientist of as much skepticism as intelligence—and that is considerable. His list of degrees, affiliations, and accomplishments is more than suitable reference for his credibility—and sensibility.\" It is, of course, our job in news media to bring before our readers all relevant happenings on our planet, provided we can get adequate information about them. I don't know of any newsman who doesn't try to do this. We cannot ignore the UFO phenomenon for one reason because many responsible people have become involved, and for another reason because responsible scientists like Dr. Dr. J. Allen Hynek s Slaty Hynek and Dr. David R. Saunders are lending their prestige to find scientific answers to the problem. And while we have a duty to report much of what is happening on the UFO front—and to a limited degree we do— we also must keep our eyes open to the interrelationships that may exist between the UFO mystery and other scientific fields of inquiry. One of our journalistic difficulties, or perhaps shortcomings might be a better way to express what 1 mean, is our reluctance—with some notable and laudatory exceptions—to seek out and report the context of events, or simply to put isolated reports, as for instance UFO sightings, in meaninful context. Let me illustrate. Since the 1969 Condon Report, whose authors, I suppose, throught they were banishing the UFO phenomenon from any further serious consideration, and the closing of the Air Force Blue Book, UFO reports persist in tantalizing the imagination of scientists and others interested in the mystery of space and extraterrestrial life. Indeed, the UFO phenomenon persists like our peculiar style of downtown architecture—contempor- ary neglect. It is worth noting here that the Condon Report's stature was most certainly enhanced when the National Academy of Sciences fully endorsed it and its methodology. Were we to put the UFO picture in true perspective, therefore, a story is in order reporting continuous UFO sightings of various degress of credibility—all over the globe. In other words, there's a story here that some of us haven't reported! and I haven't seen it elsewhere, though I may have missed it. But there's another story of greater significance and import involving the National Academy of Sciences. And this story's dimensions enhance a subject closely akin to the subject matter engaging your attention at this conference. The story was handled deftly and imaginatively by John Lear, Science Editor of Saturday Review, in the June 10; 1972, issue. Lear's piece is a fine job of reporting, and is good journalism, for he has given scope in depth of another development of great scientific potential. You here could with justice hail the revelation contained in a (continued next page) 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"MEDIA & UFOS CONTINUED document released by the Committee on Science and Public Policy of the National Academy of Sciences that a special panel of two dozen astronomers believes that there is such a thing as extraterrestrial intelligence. The astronomers, in short, believe life exists on the planets of many stars other than the sun, and that the extraterrestrial creatures involved may be trying to communicate with other beings in the universe. Lear's article was headlined, incidentally, \"The search for man's relatives among the stars.\" • Lear introduced his article by 'posing an imaginative want-ad that reads as follows: \"Historic opportunity: Is a generous person who can afford to spend $70 million of his own money willing to spend it in hunting for man's long-lost relatives far out among the stars? Will this person please contact Prof. Melvin Calvin, chairman, Committee on Science and Public Policy, National Academy of Sciences, Washington, D.C.\" Because I believe it has intense interest here, I am picking up Lear's paraphrase of the NAS document, a liberty I'm sure the Saturday Review will forgive, for it should whet your appetite to buy the magazine and read the entire article: \"During the last few years so many of the primitive molecules from which the building blocks of life on earth are made have been seen in the distant sky that the existence of life on the planets of many stars other than the sun can be taken for granted. The inhabitants of some of these planets must be at least as intelligent as we are, and it is logical to assume that they use the electromagnetic spectrum to communicate with each other over long distances, as we do. We could eavesdrop on their messages now if we tried hard enough. Because our own fate as a species ultimately depends on our willingness to recognize ourselves as evolving creatues in an evolving environment, we cannot afford to wait much longer before beginning to listen seriously for clues to the whereabouts of these remote civilizations, locate 16 Charles E. Barnum, Keynote Speaker them, and try to engage them in conversation, pending the still unforeseeable time when discovery of new physical laws may allow us to visit them or permit them to visit us.\" The NAS report said in addition that \"at this instant through this very document are perhaps passing radio waves bearing the conversations of distant creatures, which we could record if we but pointed an existing radio telepscope in the right direction and tuned it to the proper frequency.\" The articles I have quoted from are excellent examples of good press coverage of man's search to unlock the doors to the unknown and thus enrich the destiny of all of us here on earth. Dr. Hynek expressed the wish for a massive scientific investigation of the UFO phenomenon. Such an investigation would take the same kind of money Lear seeks for NAS's probe for extraterrestrial life—a goal believed entirely achievable if sufficient resources are forthcoming. UFO COVERAGE Unraveling of the UFO mystery, too, is possible, in my view after an altogether too brief study of press and book coverage of UFO's. But this will take time, effort, and all the enthusiastic persistence you who are studying UFO's can muster. In fact, you'll have to go way beyond the motivation of a certain doctor in our town who doesn't operate unless it's necessary. If he doesn't need the money, he doesn't operate. Meanwhile, back on the farm. I've been forgetting my purpose here. I'm a feeble keynoter; in fact, I've wandered a bit from the so-called topic Walt assigned me. Strictly hewing to our performance record to date —with some exceptions—our job is to remain objectively interested, reporting UFO sightings without bias. In closing, I have several suggestions concerning the way UFO's should be reported—these suggestions come from many of us in the news media. Rushing to news rooms with stories of isolated sightings by one or two individuals will neither serve the cause of UFO scientific inquiry, nor the public's need to know. You realize only too well that sometimes you take months to verify the substance of such reports, so hasty publication might be misleading and present the whole UFO picture in a bad light. Certainly, if a UFO is witnessed by several, say 5 or more, reliable persons, (continued, page 12)"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"RENDLESHAM FOREST AFFAIR Walt Andrus, Jr. SKY CRASH: A Cosmic Conspiracy By: Brenda Butler, Jenny Randies and Dot Street Published by: Neville Spearman Limited The Priory Gate, Friars Street Sudbury, Suffolk, England Published: October 25, 1984 Price: 7.50 pounds SKY CRASH is a culmination of nearly three and one-half years of research on one specific UFO case that involves close, encounters of the first, second and probably the third kind. The question posed is: \"what really happened in the Rendlesham Forest in close proximity to the east gate of the U.S.A.F. Base at Woodbridge on the nights of December 27 and December 29/30, 1980?\" Starting from a rumor, Brenda Butler, through her personal contacts at two major U.S. Air Force bases, discovered an event like the plot from a science-fiction movie. For who could believe in tales of contact between the authorities of this world and the explorers of another alien realm? \"It was like something out of Star Wars,\" one witness.has explained. Even though the plot for SKY CRASH reads like science-fiction, if what the authors have been told.by several different sources was even remotely near the truth, then Rendlesham Forest has played host to - one of the most significant events in the history of this planet. BREAKTHROUGH Steve Roberts, a security officer in the U.S.A.F. stationed at Bentwaters/ Woodbridge, provided the first clue to Brenda six days after the December 27th monumental event. Realizing one person was inadequate to investigate a sighting with this potential, Brenda shared her information with Dot Street. The two worked as a team during the latter part of January, 1981. In February 1981, Jenny Randies became part of this intriguing mystery and subsequently summarized the entire case, as it was then known, into the book SKY CRASH. The credentials for these three \"super-sleuths\" are as follows: Brenda Butler — housewife and independent investigator of strange phenomena from Leiston, Suffolk, and family friend of Steve Roberts; Jenny Randies — fulltime author from Warrington, Chesire, and Director of Investigations for the British UFO Research Association (BUFORA); and Dot Street — housewife and accredited regional investigator for BUFORA from Oulton Broad, Suffolk. As a full-time freelancer with several books, Jenny Randies was able to tie all of the loose ends together and write SKY CRASH with the research aid of Brenda and' Dot. The three author/investigators have written SKY CRASH in a chronological sequence which follows their unrelinguishing search for the truth to the initial rumor. It is not the typical UFO story, since it contains all • the ingredients of a spy thriller: fear spiced with mystery, intrigue and devastating consequences. Using the writing techniques of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Earle Stanley Gardner, Jenny Randies has the reader anticipating what new clue will unfold as the persistent investigation continues. The format is clearly that of a detective thriller, though SKY CRASH is backed up by documented testimony and demonstrates an official cover-up from the very beginning. CONFIRMATION The evidence is undeniable, supported as it is by official confirmation from both the Pentagon and the British Ministry of Defense. It is impossible to confront this evidence and conclude that something strange did not take place in Rendlesham Forest on the nights in question. Since I consider this book and its investigation one of the most significant cases of the modern era, I will make no attempt to review it in depth, but will instead recommend it to all serious UFO investigators and researchers. SKY CRASH is probably the finest example of how a rumor about a UFO landing is diligently pursued, and how three competent and experienced investigators unearthed clues and solved an insurmountable jig- saw puzzle over a three year span. CREDIT We must give the majority of the credit to the three tenacious English investigators for their \"never-say-die\" attitude when they were confronted with government secrecy by both British and United States officialdom. At the same time, we must also acknowledge the outstanding work by Barry Greenwood, Larry Fawcett- and Lucius Farish in the U.S., who provided numerous pieces of the puzzle. Without this cooperative investigation, transatlantic telephone calls, utilizatipn of the Freedom of Information Act, etc., the key evidence would probably not have been forthcoming, since it was indeed a U.S. Air Force event and not a Royal Air >Force incident. The authors have acknowledged credits and expressed their gratitude to each of the key participants in their book by name where permitted. Pseudonyms have been used throughout and are so identified to protect the witnesses; in addition, the book clearly depicts the unfortunate treatment dealt U.S. airmen and British civilians when they were subsequently exposed.

In the prologue to the book, the authors briefly state their own feelings in this regard: \"We concluded that we had no more right to the facts than you have.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Dear Editor, As a subscriber to the Journal and one fully aware of the paradoxical nature of the UFO phenomenon I would like to express some thoughts I have had after reading several articles presented in recent issues. Basically I would like to address this letter to those individuals who consider themselves field investigators and/or write articles on this group of phenomenon. 18 From the very beginning the term 'UFO was intended to indicate an object, apparently manufactured, whose design seems to exhibit a level of technology higher than our own and whose motions seem to defy our commonly accepted laws of physics. This is not to imply that a UFO must be 'nuts and bolts', but that it is a device! Presently the term 'UFO' seems to be thrown into any situation where an observer cannot readily identify what he is seeing. If such a sighting then turns out to have a conventional or natural explanation it only serves to detract from the reality of the UFO phenomenon as a whole. I would like to see field investigators concentrate their efforts on investigating 'high-strangeness' incidents, UFO reports that fit the criteria! This is not to say that reports of nocturnal lights or otherwise should not be recorded and checked, but the case for UFO's would be best served by concentrating on those sightings that stand the best chance of yielding significant results: As for the articles published on this topic, I would prefer to read in-depth interviews with persons influential in this field of study, or updates on recent events. Perhaps one page with a simple break-down of extremely current reports by day, date, location, and category would be simple and informative as far as general sightings are concerned. Far too often I have read a step-by-step account of a nocturnal light that indicated nothing that truly qualified it as a UFO. Too many articles on this phenomenon turn out to be 'stories' instead of informative articles. At times it appears that the area of 'UFO phenomenon' has been made so broad that anyone wanting to take a figurative 'shot' at it will be assured of hitting something. The phenomenon itself has come to encompass a hodgepodge of Fortean elements and therefore it becomes even more crucial that we remember that what we are trying to establish is not the existence of a UFO phenomenon,but the existence of a UFOl Sincerely; Christian P.

The men clearly knew what they were doing and worked rapidly, pausing only to sharpen their tools. They shared a single bucket of water into which they occasionally dipped their hands. On a whole, the operation was remarkably bloodless, even when they cut into the chest cavity and later removed the legs. In less than an hour the entire bull was history, having been field-dressed, hung on hooks and sold off. On the ground itself there was hardly any blood at all, the great majority being contained by the bull's flayed hide. The point I am trying to make here is that incredibly deft and devastating violence can be wrought on a fresh carcass by skilled hands, in the field, and leave only an amazingly small residue of blood behind.

As technical advisor for the film, Stan tried very hard to keep out the last two minutes dealing with the Bill Meier hoax in Switzerland, but was unsuccessful.

Ken Hanke is the Assistant Chairman for the 1985 Symposium. I had listed both he and his wife, Helen, as Assistant Chairpersons. Helen is heading up one of the committees. * * * . • Bruce Maccabee and the Fund for UFO Research announced on September first' that UFONET had been placed on \"temporary hold\"- after a four month period of operation -in which the expenses had been greater than anticipated (i.e., $1.00 per minute of connect time to the computer plus about $ .10 per minute telephone long distance expenses). Over the past four months the expense had averaged several hundred dollars per month with only about a dozen active participants. The Fund has estimated that it would cost as little as $12.00 per month per user to maintain UFONET at a low level of operation; that is, participants would check in several times a month. In view of the expenses described, the Fund has invited interested people to write a letter indicating whether or hot they would be willing to pay part of the UFONET costs, and if so, at what rate — $10.00 per hour, $5.00 per month, etc. In the meantime, Michael D. Hart, Director of the COMPUFON NETWORK, 803 5th Place S.E., Duvall, WA, 980i9 has set up a computer network as of November 20, 1984. Anyone in MUFON or elsewhere that would like access to the new Network should contact Michael at the above address or by telephone during the day at (206) 788-5307 and he will supply them with the pertinent information. There is no charge for the use of the system, although there is the cost of the long distance call made by each user. The system allows access by any of the present computers on the market such as Apple, I.B.M., Kaypro, Commodore, Atari, Texas Instruments, etc. Mr. Hart is the State Section Director for King County. * * * MUFON has obtained one hundred additional copies of the third printing of CLEAR INTENT (paperback) which are available for $8.95 plus $1.50 for postage and handling in U.S. funds. Foreign subscribers must use an International Postal Money Order or a check drawn upon a bank in the U.S.A., since collection costs of other checks exceeds the face value of the check. The MUFON Journal Staff would like to take this opportunity to extend our best wishes for the new year to our friends around the world. 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE by Walt Andrus Thomas P Deuley has become the new State Director for Texas replacing the Reverend G. Ncal Hern who resigned due to increased responsibilities within the Episcopalian Church in the Dallas Diocese. In addition to serving as the MUFON Corporate Secretary and Art Director for the MUFON UFO JOURNAL, Tom is also a member of the Board of Directors of the Fund for UFO Research. He was the Host Chairman for the MUFON 1984 UFO Symposium in San Antonio and just completed two terms as President of MUFON of San Antonio. ; / * * * . . , Bob Grattan, State Director for Virginia, recently received a Fulbright Scholarship to teach library automation and computer literacy in Tunis, Africa, at the University of Tunisia from December 1984 to August 1985. Mr. Grattan has been alerted to seek a professional ufologist in Tunisia to represent MUFON in this north African nation, during his teaching scholarship. * * * Marge Christensen, Public Relations Director, has announced plans for the National UFO Information Week to be held from August 18 to 25, 1985 in the MUFON P.I.P.E. Line newsletter to State Public Relations Directors. Each local group should start now to make plans for public UFO exhibits, one day seminars, publicity in the local news media, video documentary displays, lectures, etc. in order to be prepared for this ambitious nation-wide public education event. MUFON will provide printed handouts on UFO information (8'/ 2 x 11\"), one sheet, both sides, with the MUFON address (international) and space for stamping the name of the local organization sponsoring the event and TOM DEULEY the \"UFO Hotline\" telephone number where available. * * * Dorothy Soultanokis, office manager for SBI, has advised their members and associates concerning the health status of Peter Mazzola, International Director. As many of Pete's friends know, he is retired from the New York City Police Department as a result of injuries sustained that caused permanent nerve damage. Compoun- ding this situation, on the morning of November 9, he was involved in a serious automobile accident requiring hospitalization and remained in serious condition. After nearly three weeks' confinement in the Intensive Care Unit, he developed pneumonia. As of December 5, his doctors say he is recuperating and is expected to be released prior to Christmas to rest and recuperate further at home. It has been suggested that \"Get Well\" cards be sent to Pete at P.O. Box 193, Staten Island, NY 10312. We wish Pete a speedy recovery. When speaking of ambitious and significant projects, David Christensen had embarked on a computerized file listing all books, periodicals, audio and video cassettes, microfilm and books of news clippings at the MUFON resource centers across the country. Starting with the extensive library of Barry J. Greenwood, Staff Historian, and Doug La bat in New Orleans, Louisiana, the computerized file already has 600 books, 700 periodicals, 415 audio and video cassettes, 120 rolls of microfilm and 30 books of news clippings. We will be entering the MUFON library in Seguin, Texas, into this file early in 1985. At this stage, David Christensen is not tabulating UFO cases or Government Documents, however plans have been made to do so. This started out as a joint venture with Barry Greenwood and MUFON of Massachusetts, however, it will eventually become a series of national resource centers, designating where information is available. For those of you who haven't met David personally, he is the congenial husband of Marge, and an integral member of the Christensen UFO team. * * * The Cable News Network (CNN) has been working for several months on the Rendlesham Forest UFO incident for a TV documentary. December 27, 1984, marks the fourth anniversary of this intriguing event and could be the date of showing on national television. ABC-TV News sent a film crew to England on December 5, 1984, to also film this case known by the title of the new book, SKY CRASH, by Brenda Butler, Dot Street and Jenny Randies.
