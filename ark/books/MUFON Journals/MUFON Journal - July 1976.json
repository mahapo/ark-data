I found the comments most complimentary and will at- tempt to build future is- sues around the very help- ful suggestions I received. Please keep the suggestions and material coming, since the \"JOURNAL\" belongs to all of us! Along the same lines, I am happy to announce the appointment of Richard Hall and Mark Chesney as Assoc- iate Editors. Both have been tremendously helpful, and it is only proper that they receive the credit due them. Richard Hall, as all of you know, is the Inter- national Coordinator MUFON. Richard is a gifted writer and spends a good deal of his valuable time preparing material for the \"JOURNAL\". Mark Chesney has also volunteered his time to the MUFON UFO JOURNAL. Mark is no new-comer to ufology. He served as Investigations Co- ordinator for the Center for UFO Studies and has had a life-long interest in the subject. We still need vol- unteers to write up cases for the MUFON UFO JOURNAL, so let us know soon if you are interested! One final note pertaining to the Travis Walton article in this issue. It in no way is an attempt to discredit any organization or invest- igator and should not be con- strued as such. It is pre- sented for the information of MUFON members in what has become one of the most fascinating cases of the decade.

The photographer, who wishes to remain anonymous, was at this time in the military which was known as the Federal Forces. The Federal Forces were in charge of patrolling the borders of the Central African nations. On the particular day that this photograph was taken (the photographer cannot recall the exact date) it was very hot and the sun was very bright. He was aboard a helicopter (French \"Alouette\" type) which was performing practice landing and takeoff maneuvers. The reason for this was that only about a month previous to this a helicopter had landed on what was thought to be a clear beach. Upon leaving the helicopter, the troops soon found that this clear beach was crawling with alligators and they made a very rapid departure from there. The photographer had been taking photos of these \"water practices\" and of the numerous game that were in the area. He was using a \"cheap Agfa camera that had cost about twelve pounds\". The time was \"about noon\" and they were at an altitude of approximately two hundred feet and travelling at approximately one hundred and twenty miles an hour. It was at this time that the UFO came up from behind the mountain top (see photo) travelling at a tremendous speed straight up and directly over the top of the helicopter and disap- peared over the opposite horizon. \"It took no more than ten seconds from the first observation PAGE M '- . J Enlargement of Chingola Photograph. (coming up from behind the mountain tops) until it disap- peared over the opposite horizon.\" There was only time for one very quick shot, which he took. It tra veiled Jn a \"straight line almost directly overhead.\" The shape was perfectly round and the color was silver with a chrome or mirror-like surface. There were no lights, no sound heard (probably due to the chop- per noise), no smoke, no iden- tification marks- no extentions, no holes, no windows, platforms, doors, aerials, no legs or wheels. The color was completely uniform and it seemed to reflect the bright sunlight all the time, never in- creasing in brightness or fading. The photographer guessed the distance to be anywhere from one .to three miles away. In addition to the photographer, there were four other witnesses including the pilot of the chopper. One of the other witnesses was a fellow by the name of Chippy Ackerman, who was killed in 1964 by' a antipersonnel mine in the Congo. Another witness was a Gerrie Schultz, whose present whereabouts is uncertain. [-. the pilot's name -was Brahm whose present whereabouts is either Canada or the Bahamas. None of these individuals have ever been contacted on this matter again since the incident. This was the first time any of these men had ever seen a UFO and their first thoughts were that it was some highly secret aircraft of the United Nations forces in the area. This notion was quickly rejected because of the velocity attained and the unusual shape. When the military authorities \"got wind\" of. news that this photographer had been taking photographs of the border areas during their practice exercises they confiscated all the negatives. Fortunately, the photographer had already made a set of prints^ from these negatives and this is what was left for us. The negatives were never returned and it was assumed that because of the nature of the area photographed, they were destroyed. This meant that the negative with the UFO on it was also destroyed or filed away by the authorities of the Federal Forces at the time. The photographer kept this one photograph in his personal photo"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"collection and in the summer of 1975 when there was a UFO flap taking place over Rhodesia, he telephoned an individual, who at the time was acting as the UFO central gathering office and inquired if she might be interested in a photograph he had taken back in 196i. She informed him that she would be and he then sent in his photograph to her for whatever it might be worth. This photo was then forwarded on to me for further study here in the U.S. Although, it certainly is not one of the clearest UFO photos ever taken, it does reveal an aerial object that cannot be explained as anything known to present day aircraft. The photograph that was kept all these years was in very poor condition and had been bent to the point, where the emulsion was cracked in many vertical lines which extended through the entire picture. Also the photographer took it upon himself to circle the UFO in ballpoint pen, which could not be removed from the photo without also removing the emulsion from the ridges of the vertical cracks. With this as the total amount of background data, the next step was a complete and thorough evaluation and analysis by the technicians at Ground Saucer Watch in Phoenix, Arizona. Copies of the print were then forwarded to Mr. William Spaulding for examination and •, testing by GSW.

WILLIAM HAUCK, EDITOR 11*4 GOSTLIN STREET HAMMOND, IND. 46327 •BY WILLIAM SPAULDING, GSW INC. STEP A - EDGE ENHAN- CEMENT PROCESS The edging technique was per- formed with a newer (modified) program. In Photo I the shape of the 'object' becomes well-defined. The bright area on the UFO, represents the point where the sun is reflecting off the object. By measuring this area with color densitometry it was determined that the 'object' has a metallic surface. (Reference should be made to the previous supplied digital density data). The darkest point on the 'object' (180° op- posite) indicates a true curved plane. A cursor (an electronic profiler) which reveals real shape and the measurable aspect ratio, displays a disc-shape (a curved top surface). Although the general picture quality is poor and the UFO is reflecting brilliantly in the sunlight, causing the density of the UFOs surface to be ap- proximately the same as the surrounding sky, the following quantifying data was retrieved from the evaluation.. 1) The aspect ratio (height to wid- th) is 1 to5. (ReferencePhoto II). This is measured by superim- posing an electronic grid over the photograph and measuring the ratio with a video micrometer (W/digital results) 2) The 'object' is; fairly close (estimated 2-3 mis based on com- puter data) to the witness(es) camera and is slightly blurred. This movement, in GSWs opinion is a combination of the following; the slow speed (Low ASA nunv ber) of the color film and rapid ob- ject movement. Note the foothills and/or mountains are out of focus, however the high cirrus clouds are in a fairly good focal plane STEP B - COLOR CON- TOURING This analysis is generally per- formed to evaluate the substance and reflectivity of an object on any photographic/radiographic medium by scanning each pixel (picture cell) with;digital den- sitometry. , * A wispy white cloud, usu. of minute ice crystals formed at altitudes of 20,000 to 40,000 feet A pixel is the basic element of picture resolution in the Com- puter Scan System. A picture is divided into an array of 512 horizontal columns and 480 ver- tical rows, thus producing 245,760 equal and discrete pixels. Each pixel is then assigned a value based on the average level of grey contained in that minute portion of the picture. The grey scale (Z - value of the pizels) ranges from 0 to 255, where 0 is black and 255 is white. By evaluating your data and comparing it to a certified material photographic step wedge, the 'reflective' density was similar to a polished steel surface: However the assumption is based on the sun angle (azimuth) from the photographic angles (shadows), ie, this is sub- jective data rather than hard, ob- jective facts. Possibly our azimuth angle is 10° -15° off, due ; to erroneous calculations, however the object in the photograph is definitely metallic. Photograph III gives you an idea PAGE 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"of the color contouring effect for analysis purposes. Photo IV is a color profile (histogram) of our metallic photographic step wedge. CONCLUSIONS: After a complete review of the total data the following items can be disregarded as the source of the object: l)Len(s) flare 2) Len(s)/camera anomalies 3) Developing/processing (chemical) artifacts 4) Known airborne craft 5) Models or other small objects - close to the camera 6) Any non-metallic object - debris Based on the information retrieved from the entire com- puterized evaluation, it is the unanimous opinion of GSW that the object displayed in the photograph depicts a large (30 foot) object, with a metallic sur- face, of an unknown origin and technology. MUFON REPRESENTATIVE FOR SOUTH AFRICA RESIGNS BY RICHARD HALL Carl van Vlierden, MUFON's Representative for South Africa for the past 2-1/2 years, resigned in April. Citing the \"pressure of work,\" Carl noted: \"I have not been able to give MUFON all the attention it deserves as your representative. Wishing you, and MUFON, all the very best for the future.\" MUFON wishes to thank Carl publicly for his support and help. We are still represented by Mrs. Cynthia Hind, P.O. Box 768, Salisbury, Rhodesia, who has agreed to copy and circulate to other UFO researchers in Africa reports and news sent to her. PAGE 6 HE W \"INTERRUPTED JOURNEY\"? by Jean Bastlde A French civil servant, Miss Helene Giulana, 20, experienced a very strange adventure on the night of June 10/11, 1976. Miss Giuliana is honorably known in the town of Hostun (Department of Drome, France) by all the inhabitants and the Mayor, since she is employed in the Town Hall. About the experience she said: \"I was afraid to tell this; I was frightened, for I thought they would laugh at me.\" But she finally made up her mind, somewhat reluctantly, to tell her fantastic story. She was driving her car (a \"4 Li\"') on National Route 531 from Valence (Drome) to Hostun, where she lives, when the ex- perience occurred. She had been to the movies in Valence and had just drunk some black coffee. Just after she crossed the bridge of \"Le Martinet\" (a littte past Pizancon on the \"Commune\" of Chatuzange-le-Goubet) her car inexplicably began to lose speed. She stopped, opened the door, and examined the level of petrol in the car's tank, which was quite nor- mal. She resumed the trip, but the engine failed several times and, abruptly, the headlights went off and the engine stopped. It was ap- proximately 1:30 AM. At 15 m (about 50 feet) in front of the car, she saw. a strange luminous orange-colored mass standing on the road. Frightened, she locked all the doors and covered her eyes with her hands. Finally, she glanced at the road, but the thing had disappeared af- ter an unknown period of time. The car started perfectly and, panic-stricken, she failed to take the well-known way home, instead taking the long way around via La Beaume d'Hostun \"When I arrived home,\" she said, \"it was 4 o'clock. But the trip had to be only 30 minutes, not 2-1/2 hours.\" The strange fact is, therefore, that nearly two hours elapsed during which the car was im- mobilized, and she cannot remember exactly what hap- pened during these two hours, just as in the \"Betty and Barney Hill case. As Betty Hill has said under hypnosis, \"...and the motor died; the car stalled.\" All UFOlogists have read what happened after that. 1976MUFON SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS (84 pages) \"Swamp Gas Plus Ten - And Counting\" by'Dr. J.

Submitted by Jean Beatlde, translated by Lex Mebane). An unusually well-qualified wit- ness reported a startling UFO sighting which occured about 9:30 PM September 26, 1975 at Asser- vent, a small village near Maubeuge, France. Michel Satsi, 33, is an aeronautics buff and reserve lieutenant in the Air For- ce. He served 8 years as an of- ficer-instructor at NATO bases, with tours of duty in Germany and the U.S. \"I keep asking myself what it was I saw that evening,\" he says. \"All I know is that it was a flying machine—or, two flying machines—that made use of a perfectly astounding technology.\" Sasti, who flies radio-controlled model planes, was working on a model helicopter in his living room about 9 PM that night. A friend who was leaving came back inside and told him that there was an unusual orange light in the direction of La Salmagne airport. He and his wife joined the friend and they stared at the light. Satsi decided to investigate; he picked up a camera, whistled for his dog, and the two men started out. Oddly, the dog, who loves to go riding, obstinately refused to get in the car. In about 5 minutes they reached >the area called La Fagnee and could see an enormous cigar- shaped object hovering over freshly plowed fields and corn- fields. Satsi drove around on side roads trying to get closer. Sud- denly his car motor died and the headlights went out, and they coasted to a stop. They noted other stopped cars there, but none of the occupants got out. S atsi and his friend struck out across, the field, finally coming to a hedge. The UFO appeared to be about 300 m away. Satsi pushed on through the hedge, but his friend stopped. He noticed that the shape had not changed at all; judging by the trees, he estimated the altitued as about 20 m and the diameter 250- 300m. Satsi had just taken a photograph when the UFO began to roll slightly, like a boat on the waves. He could then see against the dull orange color of the main body a series of lighter and brighter lights slowly moving counterclockwise. He determined that the entire object was rotating, not just the lights, and due to the roll could now see that the UFO was circular. At this point, a cone-shaped object detached itself from the top of the craft and rose slowly to a height of about 100 m, and departed laterally to the left. About 10 minutes later it returned and re- entered the main craft. No aper- ture could be seen where the cone exited and entered! After the rendezvous the UFO stabilized, the \"portholes\" disap- peared, the light became more in- tense, and it took off at fantastic speed, disappearing within 5 seconds. \"I was very astonished,\" Satsi said. \"That machine was not moved by the known propulsion methods, airscrew or jet, because I noticed neither sound, nor wind, nor smoke, nor heat at the time it took off.\" During the observation Satsi took eight photographs. None of them \"turned out to be good.\" (Ed. Note: ..•'•..,. Although Nostradamus : is a newspaper pf unknown reliability, the account also quotes a regional director of Lumieres Dans la Nuit and the case appears to be authen- tic. Comments are invited from French UFO investigators who know of the case). • PAGE 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"THE TRAVIS WALTON ABDUCTION BY PHILIP J. KLASS (AUTHOR OF UFOs' EXPLAINED, RANDOM HOUSE 197A AND VI'NTAGE PRESS 1976) THIS IS THE FIRST OF A TWO-PART SERIES ON THE NOW FAMOUS TRAVIS WALTON ABDUCTION CASE. BE- CAUSE OF THE POSITIVE HANDLING THIS PUBLICATION GAVE THE' CASE WHEN IT F'l R ST .OC CURRED, WE THOUGHT IT IMPORTANT THAT ML) FON MEMBERS BE AWARE OF THE NEW FACTS BROUGHT TO LIGHT HERE. (Summary of the incident as reported in the news media: On the evening of Nov. 5, 1975, at ap- proximately 6:15 p.m. MST, a crew of seven young woodcutters, headed by Michael Rogers, was returning home. Rogers (age 28) was under contract to the U.S. Forest Service to thin out 1,277 acres of National Forest land near Turkey Springs. According to the story later told by Rogers, and other members of his crew (ages 17-25), they saw a UFO hovering nearby. They claim that Travis Walton jumped out of the moving car and walked/ran under the UFO, that he was \"zapped\" by an intense glowing beam from the UFO, and that the rest of the crew panicked and drove off, leaving their friend behind. A short time later, they claim, they returned to the spot to seek Travis but that he had disappeared — seemingly carried off by the UFO. It was not until more than two hours later that Rogers and his crew decided to report the incident to Under- Sheriff L.C. Ellison in nearby Heber, Ariz. (While Travis was missing, Rogers and the other five young men took a polygraph test, on Nov. 10, administered by C.E. PAGE 8 Gilson of the Arizona Dept. of Public Safety of Phoenix. Five of the young men \"passed\" the examination but the results for one (Allen M. Dalis) were \"in- conclusive,\" according to Gilson. The reported test results have been widely interpreted as en- dorsing the authenticity of the alleged UFO abduction. (Shortly after midnight on Nov. 11, Travis telephoned his sister, Mrs. Grant Neff, of Taylor, Ariz, (near Snowflake), from a phone- booth in Heber, about 30 miles away. Mr. Neff and Travis's older brother Duane, who had come to Snowflake from his home in Phoenix shortly after the alleged UFO incident, both drove to Heber to pick up Travis^ They reported finding him crumpled on the floor of the phone-booth, and in a very \"confused\" mental state. A short time after returning Travis to his mother's home in Snowflake, Duane decided to drive Travis to Phoenix, repor- tedly to obtain medical assistan- ce. Later that same day he was examined by two physicians at the request of APRO. (On Feb. 7, 1976, almost three months after Tavis's return, he and Duane took polygraph tests administered by George J. Pfeifer, then employed by Tom Ezell & Associates of Phoenix. Ac- cording to published reports, both men passed the exam which in- volved many questions dealing with Travis's claim of having been abducted by a UFO. The widely publicized results of these tests seem to confirm that such an incident actually occurred.) The alleged \"UFO abduction\" of Travis Walton on Nov. 5,. 1975, in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest (Ariz.) is a hoax, and the claims of six other young wood- cutters that they saw the alleged incident are not true. Evidence that indicated that the incident was a hoax has long been known to APRO (Aerial Phenomena, Research Organization), a large Tucson-based UFO group, and to the \"National Enquirer\" newspaper. This evidence has been withheld from APRO's membership and from the public. WHAT THE PUBLIC AND APRO MEMBERS HAVE NOT BEEN TOLD IS THAT TRAVIS WALTON TOOK A LIE- DETECTOR TEST THREE MONTHS EARLIER, ON NOV. 15,1975. HE FLUNKED IT!"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"This first lie-detector test was given in the Sheraton Hotel in Scottsdale on the afternoon of Nov. 15. Arrangements for the test were made by Mr. L.J. Loren- zen, APRO's International Direc- tor. The tests were paid for by the \"National Enquirer,\" This Nov. 15 lie-detector test that Travis Walton failed was given by John J. McCarthy, direc- tor of the Arizona Polygraph Laboratory in Phoenix. Mc- Carthy, who has been practicing for nearly 20 years, was trained at the Army's polygraph school at Fort Gordon, considered to be the top polygraph school in the U.S. McCarthy is a member of the American Polygraph Assn. and has been licensed by the State of Illinois since 1964. (Arizona presently does not require polygraph examiners to take a rigorous test to practice in the state although such legislation is now pending.) Immediately after the test, Mc- Carthy reported his findings of \"gross deception\" to Paul Jenkins of the \"National Enquirer\" and to Dr. James A. Harder, APRO's director of research and Harder then relayed the results by telephone to APRO's Lorenzen, according to McCarthy. Duane Walton, upon hearing McCarthy's conclusions, became furious with the polygraph examiner, Mc- Carthy told me. The \"National Enquirer\" asked McCarthy to send a formal writ- / ten report to Mr. John Cathcart at the newspaper's headquarters in Lantana, Fla. and McCarthy was instructed not to reveal that he had tested Travis Walton. In Mc- Carthy's formal report, dated Nov. 16, he said .that his charts in- dicated that Travis Walton was \"attempting to perpetrate a UFO hoax, and that he has not been on any spacecraft.\" The very ex- perienced and perceptive Mc- Carthy reported -that he had detected a deliberate attempt by Travis Walton to distort his respiration pattern in an effort to deceive the polygraph examiner. The \"National Enquirer\" ran a feature article on the Travis Walton incident in its Dec! 16, 1975, issue. But there was no men- tion of the lie-detector test that Travis Walton had taken under McCarthy! The November 1975 issue of \"The APRO Bulletin\" carried an extensive account of the Travis Walton case, including a report on events that had transpired during the period that Travis had taken and flunked his Nov. 15 lie- detector test, but there was no mention of this test. There is hard physical eviden- ce, which I have personally examined, to show that McCarthy did test Travis Walton on Nov. 15, 1975, and that Walton failed the examination. This includes the following: (1) Polygraph examination statement of consent, dated Nov. 15, 1975, and signed by Travis Walton, in which he agrees to let McCarthy conduct the test. (2) McCarthy's written report of Nov. 16, 1975, to the \"National Enquirer,\" stating McCarthy's conclusions that the UFO incident is a hoax. (3) \"National Enquirer\" payment voucher receipt, payable to McCarthy's company, dated Jan. 14, 1976, for \"Travis Walton UFO Incident.\" (4) Agreement to conduct the test and supply written report to \"National Enquirer\" signed by Paul Jenkins and Jeff Wells. (This statement is dated Feb. 15, 1975, which is a typographical error.) During the private discussions between McCarthy and Travis Walton prior to the start of the for- mal examination, WALTON AD- MITTED THAT HE AND A FRIEND HAD ONCE BEEN ARRESTED FOR STEALING PAYROLL CHECKS; FORGING SIGNATURES AND CASHING THE CHECKS, McCarthy told me during a telephone interview on Mar. 15,1976. The accuracy of McCarthy's in- formation was confirmed when I called the office of the Clerk of the Superior Court of Navajo County, in Holbrook, on May 10,1976. Mrs. Leona Downing, chief deputy clerk, after checking the case file, informed me that on MAY 5,1971, TRAVIS WALTON AND CHARLES ROGERS HAD PLEADED GUILTY TO FIRST DEGREE BURGLARY AND FORGERY CHARGES. (Charles Rogers is a younger brother of Michael Rogers, later involved in the UFO incident.) The charges arose from the theft of blank payroll checks from the Western Molding Co., of Snowflake, where Charles Rogers then worked and where Travis Walton had earlier been employed on a part-time basis. The stolen checks were filled in with a fic- titious name, the signature of company president Robert W. Gonsalves was forged, arid the Checks were then cashed On May 10, 1971, after the two young men agreed to make restitution of the funds, Charles Rogers and Travis Walton were placed on a two-year probation. Under such circumstances, Arizona law provides that if the parties fulfill their probation period satisfactorily, they can later return and ask the Court to expunge the record,' Mrs. Downing explained to me. On Aug. 3, 1973, Travis Walton and Charles Rogers took advantage of this provision to retroactively retract their original \"guilty\" pleas and to enter \"riot-guilty\" pleas, Mrs. Downing told me. f McCarthy also told me that during his pre-examination discussions with Travis Walton, that Travis admitted that He had previously used \"pot,\" \"speed,\" and LSD. The importance of this will become apparent shortly. PAGE 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"It was not until nearly three months after Travis failed the Mc- Carthy lie-detector test that he took another, whose results have been widely publicized because he seemingly passed with flying colors. The test was arranged by APRO and was given by George J. Pfeifer, an examiner with only two years experience. Pfeifer had abandoned his own private practice in January, 1976, to go to work for Tom Ezell & Associates of Phoenix. A short time after the Walton test was given, Pfeifer decided to return to private practice. When I first talked with Tom Ezell about the Walton test on Mar. 13,1976, he explained that he had been out of town when the test was given and that APRO had made all of the arrangements directly with Pfeifer. Ezell told me that when he returned to Phoenix and discussed the Walton test with Pfeifer that he had lear- ned that APRO and the Waltons had told Pfeifer the specific questions they \"wanted asked and that Pfeifer had obliged. Ezell, who has himself been practicing for five years, told me he wanted to dig into the matter and examine the Walton charts. When next I talked with Ezell, on Mar. 22, 1976 he told me: \"According to his (Pfeifer's) report, Travis did dictate the questions that he wanted asked.\" Ezell explained, and later con- firmed in a Mar. 29 letter, that it is perfectly proper for the sponsor of a test (APRO) to indicate the areas which are to be in- vestigated. But Ezell emphasized that the polygraph examiner should use his training and ex- pertise to frame the specific questions asked of the subject. \"Because of the dictation of questions to be asked, this test . should be invalidated,\" Ezell wrote. More important, Ezell said, after examining the Travis Walton charts: \"The reactions on PAGE 10 the charts, to my way of in- terpretation, would not . be readible. You would not be able to say if he (Travis Walton) is telling the truth or if he's lying.\" Ezell reaffirmed this appraisal in his Mar. 29 letter. Pfeifer acknowledged that Travis had come in with the questions he wanted to be asked. When I asked Pfeifer if this was standard procedure, he first said it was. But when I replied that I had talked with other polygraph examiners who said it was not a normal procedure, Pfeifer replied: \"Well, like I wouldn't say no. (But) we don't have a stan- dard situation here either.\" When I asked: \"In what respect,\" Pfeifer said: \"Well, how many times do people claim that they've been picked up by a UFO? \" Pfeifer disclosed an even more \"curious\" aspect of the Travis Walton test during our Apr. 27 conversation. He said that when APRO's Lorenzen called to arrange the test he only asked that Pfeifer test DUANE Walton. There were no mention of Travis being present or being tested, Pfeifer told me. Only after Pfeifer had completed the test on Duane on the afternoon of Feb. 7, and went out to inform APRO's Loren- zen that Duane had passed, did Lorenzen then ask Pfeifer if he would test Travis Walton also. THERE IS AMPLE EVIDEN- CE THAT TRAVIS WALTON TOLD AT LEAST ONE FALSEHOOD DURING HIS FEB. 7 TEST WHICH PFEIFER FAILED TO DETECT. The question was one that Travis insisted that he be asked and which Pfeifer (in accordance with accepted procedures) discussed with Travis prior to the test to be sure that he understood its meaning and that he could an- swer it with a clearcut \"yes\" or \"no.\" That question was: \"Before November 5, 1975, were you a UFO'buff'?\" Travis answered: \"NO.\" Pfeifer believes Travis believed he was telling the truth. Yet according to McCarthy, during the pre-examination discussion with Travis, he ad- mitted that he and his brother Duane, and their mother Mrs. Mary Kellet, had often speculated about riding in a UFO. This prom- pted McCarthy to pose the following question during the for- mal examination of Nov. 15: \"In the past, have you ever thought of riding in a UFO?\" Travis an- swered: \"YES\". The resulting polygraph chart indicated that Travis was being truthful. There is extensive evidence, from sources that can not be con- sidered to be prejudiced against Travis Walton, that the Walton family had a keen and long- standing interest in UFOs before Nov. 5,1975. For example: Dr. Howard Kandell, an APRO member, was one of the two physicians who examined Travis on Nov. 11, the day that he reap- peared. During a telephone in- terview with Dr. Kandell on Apr. 25,1 asked him whether Travis or Duane had indicated any previous interest in UFOs during his Nov. 11 discussions and examination. Dr. Kandell replied: \"They admitted to that freely, that he (Travis) was a 'UFO freak,' so to speak... He had made remarks that if he ever saw one, he'd like to go aboard.\" Dr. Jean Rosenbaum, a ; psychiatrist from Durango, Colo., journeyed to Phoenix and in- terviewed Travis Walton several days after his reappearnce. APRO's Dr. James A. Harder was present during the interview. During a telephone interview on Apr. 26, I asked Dr. Rosenbaum whether Travis had mentioned any prior interest in UFOs during their interview. Dr. Rosenbaum replied: \"Everybody in the family"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"claimed that they had seen them (UFOs)... He's been preoccupied with this almost all of his life... Then he made the comment to his mother just prior to this incident that if he was ever abducted by a UFO she was not to worry because he'd be alright.\" (Env phasis added.) . Duane Walton was interviewed, along with Mike Rogers, on the evening of Nov. 8, 1975, while Travis was still \"missing.\" The interview was conducted by Fred Sylvanus, head of the Arizona Regional UFO Project and a member of Ground Saucer Watch. The interview was tape recorded and I have obtained a copy. During the interview, Duane Walton volunteered that he and Travis had often discussed the possibility of getting a 'ride on a UFO. That if either one of them got such a chance, he would try to get the UFO to go and pick up the other brother so he could share the experience. Here are Duane's precise words:  • • . .. \"Travis and I discussed this many, many times at great length and we both said .that we would immediately get as directly under the object (UFO) as physically possible... We discussed this time and time again. The opportunity would be too great to pass up and at any cost, except that of death, make contact with them and whoever happened to be left on the ground, if one of us didn't .make the grade, to try to convince whoever was in the craft to come back and get the other one. He performed just as we said we would and he got directly under the object, and he's received the benefits for it.\" Earlier in the interview with Sylvanus, Duane said: \"I saw one almost identical to what they (Mike Rogers and other crew members) described for a period of almost 30 minutes in broad daylight about 12 years ago at 1 o'clock in the afternoon, about eight miles from this location right here (site of the alleged Travis Walton incident). And it followed me around these woods for about 30 minutes and was never more than 200 feet from me at any time.\" (Emphasis added.) Yet when I interviewed Duane Walton by telephone on Apr. 23, 1976, and asked him when he and Travis first became interested in UFOs, Duane replied: \"About November 11,1975.\" Contrast Duane Walton's an- swers to some of my other questions with the known facts. For example: Klass: \"Has Travis ever gotten in trouble with the law on any serious charges?\" D. Walton: \"No sir! Everybody has trouble as a juvenile delinquent, even I.\" Klass: \"But to your knowledge, he has never been in trouble with the law in any serious thing, ex- cept maybe being arrested for speeding?\" D. Walton: \"Or a traffic warrant or ticket. But my brother is not a criminal if that's what you're trying to imply... I think on two occasions he was arrested for outstanding traffic warrants, for not paying a traffic ticket.'' SURELY DUANE WALTON WAS AWARE OF THE IN- CIDENT LESS THAN FIVE YEARS EARLIER WHEN TRAVIS HAD PLEADED GUILTY TO THE FIRST DEGREE BURGLARY AND FORGERY CHARGE. According to McCarthy, \"Duane Walton was present when Mc- Carthy reported the results of his test on Travis, and Duane was outraged at his findings. The following exchange took place with Duane during our telephone interview of Apr. 23: Klass: \"When did Travis first take a polygraph, or lie-detector, test?\" Walton: \"I don't know. I don't have the foggiest notion. I know that he and I took one together recently. That's been six weeks, maybe two months.\" Klass: \"Had he taken any polygraph test before that? \" Walton: \"I don't have the foggiest notion. I really don't know...\" Klass: \"Well, you were with him the first few days after he came back.\" Walton: \"Yup.\" Klass: \"And did he take a polygraph test at any time during that week?\" Walton: \"I don't know. I mean I was with him just about every minute of the time, but I have a job...and there were times that I had to be a way.\" Klass: \"Were you with him when he was interviewed by James Harder and the 'National Enquirer'?\" Walton: \"Yes, I was there when a doctor (Harder) gave some hyp- notic regression.\" Klass: \"And was there any polygraph test given at or about that time?\" Walton: \"I don't know sir.\" During my interview with Duane, I asked whether he and Travis had told Pfeifer the questions they wanted him to ask during their lie-detector tests: Klass: \"Who framed the questions that you were asked? Did you or Travis have anything to do with the framing of the questions?\" Walton: \"That would be kind of at odds to the end (purpose), wouldn't it? No sir, in answer to your question, no.\" Duane Walton's answers to my questions provides another useful benchmark for appraising the overall value of Pfeifer's polygraph examination of Travis and Duane Walton. During the examination of Duane, Pfeifer asked him the following: \"Would you lie to help Travis in this mat- ter? Duane answered: \"No.\" Pfeifer found no indication on his PAGE 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"charts that Duane was not telling the truth. In the polygraph test given to the six young wood-cutters, it has been reported that five of the six passed. The results for the other, Allen Dalis, were termed \"in- conclusive.\" The test was given by C.E. Gilson, a man with five years experience, employed by the Arizona Dept. of Public Safety. The test was given on Nov. 10, at a time when Walton had been missing.for five days and there was great concern by Navajo County law enforcement officers that Travis might be the victim of foul-play at the hands of his associates. For this reason, three of the four relevant questions asked by Gilson during the test dealt solely with the issue of whether the young wood- cutters had killed or physically in- jured Travis. Obviously all of the men could truthfully answer these three questions with a \"NO.\" During our May 20 interview, Gilson said: \"That was our sole purpose...to determine whether or not there had been a crime com- mitted.\" .,- Gilson said that the one question about a UFO had been added at the suggestion of Sheriff Marlin Gillespie. With the perspective of hindsight, Gilson told me on May 20: \"That one question does not make it a valid test as far as verifying the UFO incident. I wish these people out here would realize that, but there's no way you can even get them to listen to you...\" This single UFO-related question was: \"Did you tell the truth about actually seeing a UFO last Wednesday when Travis Walton disappeared?\" Note that the question did NOT ask whether they saw Travis being \"zapped\" by a UFO, nor whether they really believed that Travis had been ab- ducted by a UFO. Celestial bodies are sometimes mistaken for UFOs. At the time of .PAGE 12 the Walton incident, the planet Jupiter was very bright in the early evening sky and would have been visible at 6:15 p.m. This is NOT to suggest that Rogers and his crew honestly imagined that Travis had been \"zapped\" by Jupiter. But if they were all part- ners in a pre-arranged hoax, all might be able to answer \"yes\" to this one UFO-related question without displaying overt signs of telling a significant falsehood. The testimony by Mike Rogers and the other five crew members has . seemed to some to sub- stantiate the UFO abduction story because these six witnesses seemed to have no motive, other than possible friendship with Travis, to fabricate the story. BUT INVESTIGATION REVEALS THAT THERE WAS A MOTIVE, A STRONG FINAN- CIAL MOTIVE, FOR ALL OF THEM TO COLLABORATE ON A HOAX. In the spring of 1974, the U.S. Forest Service requested bids on a timber-thinning operation on 1,277 acres in the Turkey Springs area of the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest. Three bids were received: $71,512 $44,567 $34,989. The low bid came from Mike Rogers. His es- timate was less than half the amount of the highest bid, and 27 per cent below the mid-figure, and worked out to only $27.40 per acre. If Rogers had underestimated the amount of work involved, both he and his crew would suffer finan- cially. The contract called for the job to be completed in 200 working days, i.e. excluding bad-weather and winter when work was im- possible. Although the contract was awarded on June 26, 1974, it was not until more than a month later—Aug. 7—that Rogers finally assembled his crew and started work, according to Maurice Mar- chbanks, Forest Service con- tracting officer at Springville, Ariz. It was a portent of things to come. By the summer of 1975, it was clear that Rogers had badly un- derestimated the job and he was stuck with his fixed-price con- tract. Rogers asked for an ex- tension and the Forest Service granted one — for 84 days. The new work completion deadline as Nov. 10,1975. But in return for the extension, Rogers would be penalized $1.00 per acre for all work performed after the ex- piration of the original contract date. Rogers' financial situation was aggravated by the long-standing Forest Service policy that calls for paying contractors for only 90 per cent of the work performed, so they can pay their crews, while withholding 10 per cent until the entire job is completed. As the Nov. 10 deadline ap- proached, it was clear to Rogers that he could not meet even his ex- tended contract date. In the Nov. 8 taped interview with Sylvanus, Rogers mentioned that \"This con- tract we have is seriously behind schedule. In fact, Monday the time is up. We haven't done any work on it since Wednesday because of this thing, and therefore it won't be done. I hope they (Forest Service) take that in- to account, this (UFO) problem.\" Without the \"fortuitous\" UFO in- cident, the best that Rogers could expect would be another deadline extension, but he would be assessed still another financial penalty in contract price. More serious, winter was near and its bad weather would prevent Rogers from completing the job until the following spring. Thus the Forest Service would continue to hold back 10 per cent of the earned pay. Rogers and his crew faced a bleak financial situation as the Nov. 10 deadline neared.

This remarkable local concentration of bizarre UFO sightings covers a period of over 2- Vi years). For six days in 1974, Ernst Berger and a team from MUFON- C.E.S. conducted an intensive in- vestigation of a long series of sightings concentrated near Graz, Austria, capital of the Federal Province of Styria, from 1972 to 1974. As so often happens, the signtings came to light ac- cidentally when Berger chanced to meet the key witness, Mr. Alois A—, at a health spa in summer of 1974. Mr. A—, a dental technician, was a World War II aerial observer in charge of anti- aircraft platoons and is described as \"a sharp, analytical ob- server.\" His wife Sabine A—, another witness, is a trained nur- se. They were questioned at length and crossrexamined; key sightings were reconstructed, measurments taken, and the area explored. The objects they had seen, along with occasional other wit- nesses, included discs, cones, triangles, the classic domed ellip- se, and smaller objects moving to and from larger objects (\"satellite object\" cases). Many had sharply defined segments of geometric color patterns, and the ,bright color displays were a cen- ^ tral feature of the sightings. Another salient feature, com- monly but not exclusively, was an increase and decrease in size as if the object were moving in a straight line directly toward and away from the observer. This has been labelled the \"zoom effect.\" In various cases the UFOs disap- peared in one of three ways: by \"zooming\" out of sight upward into space, by being \"collected\" into a larger object, or by sud- denly vanishing. At Graz, the land rises from the Mur River valley towards the Graz-Webling Basin where the A— family lives in a modern house, surrounded by a wooden mountain ridge in a semi-circle stretching from north through west to south. The summits, which figure into the cases, are the Buchkogel (657 meters), the Bockkogel (539 m), and Florianiberg (520 m). Every work day, Alois A— bicycles the 10 km to work from Webling to Thondorf starting out in early morning af- ter rising about 4 am. Normally he is in bed about 10p.m. Mr. A- at the place of the \"blue hand\" incident. The strange series began May 17,1972 when Sabine A— noticed a red, star-like object moving back and forth on the southern horizon. She woke her husband, who grab- bed his 8 x 30 binoculars and ob- served the object through the open window. He saw a milky white oval, flattened on top, about 24 degrees above the horizon moving over the hills between Florianiberg and a red-orange elliptical ring was visible on the upper third. Underneath, a sack or drop-like protrusion periodically elongated and retrac- ted. (See sketch, the \"drop.\") The UFO remained visible for three hours, displaying the \"zoom ef- fect\" and departed abruptly by \"zooming\" up out of signt. A few nights later, the \"drop\" reap- peared moving jerkily along and stopping at the same spot. The experience caused Mr. A— to recall wartime observing, and he and his wife began watching the sky. In June 1972 the \"drop\" was seen again, this time along with a red disc that emitted a conical beam (see sketch). During that summer, while the sightings continued, dogs all over the area barked and howled in concert whenever the UFOs were present. \"It even developed,\" A— said, \"that when the dogs began to howl we would look out and sure enough something would be there.\" One night during this period, past midnight, an object which roughly resembled an inverted tank (ellipse with dome beneath) first appeared. Points of light were observed emitting from the dome downward toward the southwest horizon.

Two hours later the balls of light disappeared behind trees, and then points of light were seen returning to the larger UFO. The \"drop\" and another disc were also seen during the \"dance of the spheres.\" Late in July a round yellow and green object, rotating with a spiral effect, was seen by the A—'s about midnight. The light was dazzling, and Mr. A— suf- fered a splitting headache. In July or August Mr. & Mrs. A— watched a formation of four cone-shaped objects maneuvering \"like ducks in a row\" in the same area where the spheres had been. They had a green phosphorescence at the trailing edge; they stopped and tilted down above Bbckkogel before moving away to the south and disappearing. About this period, they often noticed a large number of cars with headlights on moving along the ridge on the Mantscha Road from Buchkogel to Florianiberg, sometimes recklessly at high speed. Two separate contactee prone in- dividuals also visited the A—'s during this period, but were not welcomed. >The \"sector discs\" (like color wheels) first appeared at the end of August and early September 1972, displaying four bright red and four green segments; these objects were always stationary. Also during August a new form labelled the \"tiled stove\" (because of its resemblance to old-fashioned Austrian stove tile) appeared, once dividing into nine sections. At one point small star- like objects were seen being \"collected\" by this object. Although sightings diminished early in 1973, the \"tiled stove\" was seen again during March. The \"Blue Hand\" One of the most spectacular sightings experienced by Mr. A— occurred on March 26, 1973 while he was cycling to work. It was a cold, slightly foggy morning, and the \"tiled stove\" UFO was visible, hovering ahead of him and seeming to retreat as he ap- proached. Suddenly he noticed that the damp street was brightly reflecting a blue light, apparently emanating from behind him, and he turned to see a very strange ob- ject only 300 to 400 meters away gliding silently toward him. It was rectangular with four pointed protrusions in the direction of motion, shaped something, like a hand, (see sketch) Pedalling fran- tically, bathed in the blue light, he turned again to see the UFO nearly overhead. Then it climbed upward at a steep angle (revealing a row of eight red knobs or cupolas at the rear) and vanished \"as if everything had been switched off.\" Discussing the sighting later, he thought the four sharps points might have been sharply outlined and focused beams of light. Space does not permit describing the details of the other sightings reproduced in the ac- companying sketches. The \"Scor- pio\" case occurred early in July 1973, with the object going through the pictured sequence (see sketch) between 10 PM and 3 AM.'The \"traffic signs\" (triangle and circle) were seen in August 1974. The \"wind guage/' four red spheres on two crossed bars through a central red sphere, the entire structure rotating like an anemometer, was seen in June 1972.

This seemed very odd to Mr. A—. One said he was a Harvard student and the other an astronomy student, school not mentioned. They spoke very good German. When the sub- ject of UFOs came up, one of the youths claiming to be a nephew of Capt. Charles R. Reid of the Argentina, who vanished in the Bermuda Triangle October 30/31, 1968, told that story. They were seen several times after that walking around town, apparently rooming in the area and their presence at that time could have been pure coincidence. (Ernst Berger requests information from anyone who happens to know a Mormon Harvard student who spent some time at Graz, Austria, in the summer of 1972;, his last name may be Reid). This condensed version of Berger's report can only convey some of the flavor of the full story. Appended to his report are a sec- tion describing the investigation and an evaluation section. The A— family is described as very self-critical, and very careful and consistent in their reporting. The investigators explored the sighting area, noting that it lies on an elongated platform of paleozoic rocks, two tectonic faults were found running in a north-south direction, and a karst crater (indicating limestone caves) was visible on the ridge near the Buchkogel. The strange variety of shapes reported, and the usual orien- tation toward the observer so that the axis of rotation pointed toward him, are considered extremely puzzling. Yet, investigation shows the wittnesses to be honest arid reliable, and in: Mr. A—'s case trained in aerial observations. PAGE 18 MUFON PICNIC FOREIGN STAMPS HELP MUFON by Richard Hall MUFON International Coordinator The Eight Annual MUFON Pic- nic proved to be an enlightening and entertaining affair. Over a hundred people showed for the festivities, which began at 7:00 p.m. July 10 with the UFO Skywatch at the Boulder Access on Carlyle Lake. The picnic was held the next day at the Old Fish Hatchery Park in Carlyle. The idea of a UFO Picnic was conceived by Rosie and Dick Holmes and has proved a thoroughly enjoyable and well- attended affair. Director Walt An- drus delivered a talk on the cattle mutilation cases, which he believes are due to a fanatical cult of some sort, and former Air For- ce Sargent Clarence Dargie talked about how the Air Force tries to cover up UFO sightings on the one hand while NASA tries to find sources of extraterrestrial life on the other. UFO researcher and author Joe Brill summed up some recent in- ternational cases and passed around pictures of UFOs from Romania. Bob Borman recapped the events of the Harold Sherman Psychic Seminar held in St. Louis, and developed some interesting ideas concerning the psychic com- ponent in UFO sightings. Another highlight of the picnic was the hoisting of a helium balloon craft with two American flags hanging from a crossbar. The flags, one with 13 stars and the other with 50 stars, com- memorated the years Bicen- tennial Celebration in a most spectacular fashion. But of course we shouldn't forget to mention the .real star of the UFO Picnic. Everyone knows that was Rosie Holmes' home- made chicken noodles. Delicious! An arrangement to trade can- celled foreign stamps for U.S. postage to be used for mailings to overseas MUFON supporters and information exchange centers has been worked out with stamp collector Joseph L. Nyman, Med- field, Massachusetts. This \"recycling\" will greatly benefit international exchange of UFO in- formation by helping to offset the high cost of overseas mailings. As a gesture of good faith, Mr. Nyman recently sent me a sub- stantial amount of U.S. postage (over $20 worth) in requested denominations as credit to be repaid. As a first repayment in- stallment he has been sent 1-1/2 ounces (bulk weight) of stamps taken from correspondence received from overseas. Our over- seas supporters can contribute to this exchange by the simple act of affixing commemorative stamps (or other less common types of stamps), whose exchange value is higher, to letters and packages mailed to me. MUFON specialists and other members who are receiving correspondence from overseas can also contribute to the in- formation exchange program by sending cancelled foreign stamps to me, in any quantity, for ex- change with Mr. Nyman.

William Hauck, securing a new typesetter, and by mailing from Seguin, Texas. We apologize for the inconveniences created by these delays, but the tremendous work done by Mrs. Norma Short and Mr. Dwight Connelly will be carried on in the same tradition of SKYLOOK in its successor- THE MUFON UFO JOURNAL. All subscriptions to SKYLOOK will apply directly to the JOURNAL as will MUFON membership, which includes the JOURNAL. The continuing program to arrange the MUFON membership date and JOURNAL subscription to concur sim- ultaneously will be rectified as all memberships and subscriptions are sent to MUFON at 103 Oldtowne Road, Sequin, Texas, 78155. Automatic reminders that one's MUFON membership and JOURNAL subscription will expire on a designated date will be enclosed with the copy of your JOURNAL. A productive and beneficial meeting of the JOURNAL Staff members attending the Carlyle UFO Picnic (Illinois) on July 11, 1976, was held by Dennis Hauck, Joe Brill, Lucius Parish, David Schroth, Rosetta Holmes and Walt Andrus. We are pleased to announce that Bill Pitts of Ft. Smith, Arkansas, formerly a State Section Director, will be the new State Director for Arkansas replacing Lucius Farish who resigned this post. Lou, a founding member of MUFON, will continue writing his JOURNAL column titled \"In Other's Words\" dedicated to reviewing new books and commenting on articles in newsstand publications. Mr. Pitts may be contacted by writing to 500 North 2nd St., Ft. Smith, Ark. 72901; Telephone: 501/782-0373, or at his home, 501/783-0754. Bill received inter- national recognition when he practically \"single-handedly\" conducted the \"Fort Smith UFO Conference\" on October 17, 18, and 19, 1975, utilizing the theme, \"United for Objectivity\". Bill will be travelling in Japan this fall, meeting MUFON Directors and Sectional Directors and hopefully appearing on Japanese TV as planned. Gregory M. Kanon, P.O. Box 142, Armdale, Nova Scotia, B3L 4J9, Canada, has accepted the position of Pro- vincial Director for Nova Scotia, but will also handle the rest of Eastern Canada — New Brunswick, Newfound- land, and Prince Edward Island — until such time as Provincial Directors are assigned to these areas. Gregory is a Syndicated Columnist writing a weekly column titled, \"The Unknown\", which appears in newspapers through- out North America. Greg is a graduate of the University of Arizona and his mother lives in Houston, Texas. As MUFON grows in international stature, we have found that we can be more effective in some nations by establishing a National Section instead of relying entirely upon representatives to act as liaison between exist- ing UFO organizations and MUFON. Presently we have two such sections Illobrand von Ludwiger is Director of MUFON/CES (Central European Section), or the German speaking nations of Europe; and Harold H. Fulton covers New Zealand as Director. Charles Buffer, a member of MUFON/CES recently stopped in Seguin, Texas to visit the MUFON administrative office while in the United States on vacation. He advised that they will have their third annual UFO Symposium in Munich, Germany during the later part of July. Herausgegeben von I. Ludwiger has just released a new scientific book on Electromagnetic gravitation and UFOs, which will be subsequently reviewed after translation from Deutsch. The title is \"UNGEWOHNLICHE GRAVITATIONS-PHANOMENE\". Richard H. Hall, International Coordinator, is adopting the national section in Japan as suggested by your Director with the elevation of Mr. Jun-Ichi Takanashi from liaison representative to Director for Japan. Masaru Mori (a visitor to MUFON in Seguin and presently a Field Investigator) has been appointed Sectional Director for Northern Japan with responsibility for Tokyo and Hokkaido Islands. Mori lives in Chiba City and is a free lance writer. Mr. Takao Ikeda, living in Hiroshima, will be the Sectional Director for Southern Japan responsible for the area south of Tokyo covering Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu Islands. Steve Hatzopoulos, 22 Fiddipidou St., Athens, Greece 609, has been appointed a Field Investigator for the area around Athens by Richard Hall. D.

RECAPPING AND COMMENTING by Richard Hall, MUFON International Coordinator (Comments in this month's column are based, in part, on ar- ticles appearing in the May, 1976, Skylook.) Since the May issue may be the last under Dwight Connelly's editorship, and even the last issue of \"Skylook\" under that name, it is time to publicly thank Dwight and Carolyn Connelly for the fine job they have done and the credit they have reflected on MUFON. Publishing is a costly business, and often a thankless one. We can only wish the new editor well and pledge support, especially in the form of articles and news reports in manuscript form which every editor needs. I hope all MUFON specialists will begin to realize the need for summary reports of their cases and activities. The Con- nelly's have set a high standard and a solid foundation to build on. The issue contains its share of interesting UFO cases, but we can also note a number of points related to methodology and procedures, all too often taken for granted by self-styled \"UFOlogists.\" Ray Fowler's ef- fort to compile UFO activity reports, and the Alabama UFO Study Group's similar report, are praiseworthy and a fundamental part of any systematic, scientific study. I doubt that they should take up newsletter space more than a few times a year, for they are not terribly readable nor of general interest. But they are im- portant and could be incorporated in the annual symposium proceedings, and occasionally summarized in these pages. Scientific Case Study Identification of the Clovis, N.M., photograph as a blurred image of Saturn by Ray Stanford and the P.S.I, team is the kind of analysis that needs more, rather than less, exposure. I am appalled that anyone styling him- self/herself a \"UFO researcher\" would criticize P.S.I, for releasing this information to the press. It is, first, the truth; it also shows a real scientific attitude and ob- jective reporting habits which, in the long run, should win sup- porters for the cause. They will know that we are critical, not gullible, and determined to seek out the truth. A vital part of UFO investigation is screening out errors while spotlighting their causes, and exposing hoaxes. The Director's Message in this same issue puts its finger on the problem of trying to \"scien- tifically study\" UFOs part-time. There is an inherent contradiction there which we all need to realize. Walt Andrus highlights the need for \"an increase in participation of our Advisory Board of Con- sultants, stimulation of specific investigations, and exchange of information.\" Indeed, this is exactly what is needed by MUFON and all other groups pur- porting to be studying UFOs scientifically. Just how possible it will be for part-time con- sultants/full-time scientists or engineers is the critical question. Certainly many could be more ac- tive than they have been, and the degree to which they do actively participate will determine the success and credibility of MUFON and other groups."}]
