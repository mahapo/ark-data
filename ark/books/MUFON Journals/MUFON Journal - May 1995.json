MUFON Research Specialist in Biology INTRODUCTION The following paper will address the genetic problems of an alien people called the \"Grays.\" It is not a paper com- paring human children to extraterrestrials. Even though it is highly speculative in nature, apparently no one in the med- ical field has considered the possibility that the entities commonly referred to as Grays are inflicted with the rare dis- ease progeria. It may also explain why hybridization is occurring between Homo sapiens and the aliens or entities. HUTCHINSON-GILFORD SYNDROME Among humans, Hutchinson-Gilford Syndrome, often called \"Progeria,\" has a very low incidence. On Earth it occurs about once in about every four to eight million births. (4,28) Very little is known about what causes progeria, but it is thought to be a genetic disease, the re- sult of a spontaneous mutation in the sperm or egg. (4) There is no effective treatment or cure. Life spans vary. Death typically occurs in the early teens, usually from complications of hardening of the arteries, resulting in coronary disease or strokes, although one individual in Japan lived to be forty-five. (4,5,9,10) Progeria occurs in all races of Man. The word \"progeria\" means \"before old age.\" It is a disease which appears to cause prema- ture aging in young people, and was first identified in 1886 by two physicians by the names of Hutchinson and Gilford. (28) There is more than one disease among human beings that feature alterations resembling premature aging among the very young. (15,27) While Hutchinson- Gilford Syndrome may show signs of onset in children as early as one or two years of age, Werner's Syndrome has a later onset in which individuals begin to age pre- maturely in their early teens. (4) Cockayne's Syndrome can also appear to cause premature aging in young chil- dren. (14,15,16) However, this paper will concern itself only with the Hutchinson-Gilford Syndrome, because of its unique symptoms. Unlike the other two premature ag- ing diseases mentioned, Hutchinson-Gilford Syndrome is not just a disease which appears to cause premature aging, that is, there are other symptoms present which are not found in the other two mentioned diseases, such as the very short stature, the baldness in both boys and girls, the large cranium, etc. (4,5,9,10,15) Many of the symptoms of progeria seemingly occur among a race of reported \"aliens,\" namely those hu- manoids referred to as the \"Grays.\" Grays are most of- ten reported to abduct humans (1,2,3,17,22,25), but also surface in reports of bodies associated with UFO crashes. (6,7,11,21) Most UFO abductees, without real- izing it, report physical symptoms of progeria among these aliens. This is very interesting, considering that the majority of UFO abductees are not pediatricians spe- cializing in progeria, and it is even more interesting, con- sidering that most doctors rarely ever see progeria pa- tients in their careers. COMMON FACTORS? The following is a comparison of the physical traits Grays and humans with Hutchinson-Gilford Syndrome may have in common: 1. Severely retarded growth. Most children with Hutchinson-Gilford Syndrome never exceed the height of the average five-year-old and seldom weigh more than 25-40 pounds, even as teenagers. (4,5,9,10,14,15,16) Human beings with progeria stop growing at a normal rate around age one, and then the growth rate slows. Although children with progeria rarely live beyond their teens, one gentleman with Hutchinson-Gilford Syndrome lived to be 45 years, (5) and a young woman lived to be 29. (23) The man was four feet, four inches tall and weighed 54 pounds. (5) The young woman was about four feet tall and weighed about 40 pounds. (23) A 16-year-old progeria boy weighed 41 pounds and was four feet tall. (18) A 16-year-old progeria girl was three- feet-eleven and weighed 35 pounds. (19) The heights and weights of these young adults were comparable to the heights and weights of the Grays, as reported. (2,6, 11,22) An Australian girl, Becky Coss, recently cele- brated her 16th birthday, making her the oldest girl in the world with progeria. The disease is so rare that in all the world there are only 17 known living victims, according to Bill Sample, president of the non-profit Sunshine Foundation, which sends terminally ill children and their parents on vacation. Most Grays are between three-and-a-half and four- and-a-half feet tall. Their average weight is reported to be about 40 pounds. (6) A hybrid child of Gray ancestry was reported by one UFO abductee to be at age five, three MAY 1995 NUMBER 325 PAGE 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"MLJFON UFO JOURNAL Patient displaying svinplions of Hurt liaison-Gilford Syndrome. feet tall and weighing about 25 pounds. (2) This child's height was comparable to that of a progeria child at age four and a half who was 80 cm tall or two feet seven and a half inches tall. (15) From some UFO abductee re- ports, hybrid children seem to follow the growth curves of their Gray parent rather than their human parent. If one takes into account that the average human progeria child is between two and a half feet and three feet tall at age five and three and a half feet to four feet tall in the teen years, then the hybrid child follows the growth curves of the alien parent. It seems that the Gray parent follows the growth-curve of a progeria child. A progeria child is usually of normal weight for a newborn, but after one or two years the child's growth rate decreases considerably, averaging less than half of a healthy child. Hybrid children are reported to be very small at birth.(2,3), much smaller than that of newborn progeria children which suggests that growth retardation in the hybrid child begins much earlier than in the hu- man progeria child, instead of during the second year of life. (10) This suggests that the growth retardation in the hybrid seems to start during the gestation period be- fore birth. 2. Most children with progeria are very slight in build with thin arms and legs. (4,9,10,15) The same holds true with most Grays, who are often reported as having very \"Typical\" aliens as reported by Budd Hopkins in Intruders. The above face was reportedly seen on several occasions by Debbie Jordan. Figure on page 5 was drawn by artist \"Rosemary, \"fol- lowing a 1972 NY abduction. Note mottled skin. thin limbs. (3,6) Abductee Steven Kilburn, when de- scribing the legs of one of the Grays, is quoted as saying \"... Skinny ankJes, legs. Really skinny. Not bony, nothing like that, but he's so little.\" (3) Another abductee de- scribes the Gray alien's physique in the following way: \"... so small, thin, bones...the thinness of them!\" 3. In progeria children the long bones are decalcified and thin. (10) Abductee Steven Kilburn, during hypno- sis, said, \"Their thin bones were covered with white, marshmallowy-looking flesh.\" Notice the phrase, \"thin bones.\" (3) There is one report of soft skull bones of a Gray during an alleged autopsy. (11) 4. Children with progeria almost always have dimin- ished subcutaneous fat. An abductee hypnotized by Leo Sprinkle said, \"I remember seeing them naked, waist up, thin, ribs, clavicles...The thinness of them...\" Her de- scription of the Grays she saw suggests that they, too, have diminished subcutaneous fat. 5. Baldness. Children with progeria, both male and fe- male, often have sparse body hair and are bald. Eyebrows and eyelashes are often absent. (4,5,9,10,14,15,23) This also holds true for the Grays who are always reported as being bald, lacking eye- lashes and eyebrows, and having no body hair. (2.3,6,7,8,11,17.22,26) 6. Most children with progeria fail to reach puberty. (4) In the 45-year-old man the genitalia appeared un- derdeveloped and pubic hair was absent. The 45-year- old man had some sexual function, but in most cases of progeria sexual maturation does not occur. (5) PAGE 4 NUMBER 325 MAY 1995"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL I n most Grays, lack of genitalia or even gender is often reported by UFO abductees or in UFO crash reports. (1 1,22) However, a female was purported to be discov- ered in a 1953 UFO crash in Kingman, Arizona. (6.7) She was reported to have breasts and had obviously passed puberty. This report has not been substantiated. Most Grays do not apparently develop sexually. (7.22) In the book. Matri.\\ II. it stated that only about one out of a hundred or a thousand female Grays are capable of con- ceiving children. (30) This may sound like hearsay and unreliable information, but it is interesting in that only one or two individuals out of lib recorded progeria cases have reached puberty. (5.23) This low incidence of puberty among humans with progeria matches what was said in Matrix II. One might be tempted to say that indi- viduals with progeria do not reach puberty because they do not live lo adolescence. Most children with progeria do live through the early to mid-teens (10), the average age for the onset of puberty, yet they still do not attain pu- berty, with only one or two rare exceptions. (5,23) 7. Most children with progeria have relatively large craniums. The head is almost always large relative to the face. (-4,15) The disproportionately large head in Grays is always reported by UFO abductees. as well as the small facial features below the eyes. (1,2,3,6,7, 8,11,17.20,21.22,25,26) 8. Many progeria children have very thin lips. (15) The lips are absent altogether in the Grays. (6.7) 9. Most progeria children have very small earlobes and sometimes the earlobes are absent. (4,15) In Grays, the external ears are almost always absent. (6.7) 10. Most children with progeria have very narrow noses. (4,15) The noses of most Grays are either very small or absent, having only nostrils. (2,6,7,22) 11. Most progeria children have reabsorption of the terminal finger bones (acroosteolysis). (4,15,16) The third and fourth digits of the Grays are much smaller than the others, and the thumb is reported as being absent al- together. Could this be due to bone reabsorption? (6,7,30) 12. Dystrophic nails are frequently seen on fingers of progeria children. (16) Absence of fingernails are fre- quently noted in some Grays. (6,7) 13. Progeria children have very high metabolisms. (29) There is also a report by Paul Bennewitz (30) sug- gesting that the Grays, too, are hypermetabolic. Matrix II states: \"Their [the Grays] body metabolism is very high, estimated at 110 or 115 degrees.\" (30) 14. The I.Q. of progeria children is often above nor- mal. The average being 107 (100=average), but one pa- tient tested 187 which is well above what one would consider genius level. (9) The average I.Q. among the Grays is unknown, although they seem to come from a very advanced technology. One report claimed that the Grays average I.Q. was above 200. (8) The brains and eyes of the Grays are proportionately larger than those of human progeria children, comparable to a five-month- old fetus. (7) This may be due to evolution. The eyes of the Grays may be large because the eyes are part of the brain in embryonic development. Although progeria children's eyes are relatively smaller than the eyes of Grays, the eyes are often prominent. (4,9,10,15,27) 15. In progeria children, there is progressive wasting of the skin. The skin becomes dry and wrinkled. (15) It is not uncommon for some abductees to report some of their Gray captors as being \"mottled\" or \"wrinkled.\" (2,17) (See illustration on page 5.) 16. Most progeria children have small and receding chins. (4,5,15) The chins of most Grays are described as being very small. (22) 17. The dentition of progeria children is often delayed in eruption. (16) Most Grays reported do not appear to have teeth at all, and the entire mouth is atrophied or vestigial. (7,22) 18. Many progeria children have congestive heart fail- ure. (4,5,9,10,15) Shortness of breath is a symptom of congestive heart failure common in progeria. (5) There was one report of a Gray having difficulty breathing. (2) If it was due to the Earth's atmosphere, then how did the other members of his species adapt to our atmosphere and could breathe with ease, while he could not? Some hu- mans can breathe our atmosphere with ease, whereas other humans cannot due to respiratory or congestive heart failure. Was this Gray experiencing congestive heart failure if he had a circulatory system similar to our own? 19. Difficulty walking. Some individuals with prog- eria have difficulty walking because of stiffness of joints or bad hips. The 45-year-old man with progeria had difficulty walking because of ankylosing knee joints. (5) MAY 1995 NUMBER 325 PAGES"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Not all Grays have difficulty walking, however. In the book. Missing Time, (3) abductee Steven Kilburn said un- der hypnosis, when he was describing the gait of one of the Grays, that \"when he walked, it was almost like he had two really bad knees. He was hobbling almost...shifting his weight to the left and right...And he drags his feet a little bit...\" It is interesting to note that a \"widebased shuffling gait\" is almost always seen in progeria children. (15) In Matrix II (30) there is also a report suggesting that some Grays have difficulty walking. Paul Bennewitz stated in a letter: \"Many in this culture [Gray culture] walk with a limp or shuffle their feet.\" Note the word \"shuffle.\" The UFO abductee who was hypnotized by Dr. Sprinkle not only described her Gray abductors' thin bones, but also described their gait: \"They shuffle, drag their feet.\" (20) Again, notice that she used the word \"shuffle.\" It is worth noting that the Neilson Handbook of Pediatrics also uses the phrase \"widebased shuffling gait\" when describing the gait of children with progeria. (15) Many progeria children have a condition called \"cox- avalga,\" a condition of the hip sockets which may affect their gait. (5,15) Were the two abductees above de- scribing coxavalga when they were describing the shuf- fling gait of one of their Gray captors? 20. Human beings with progeria frequently have thin and high-pitched voices. (15) It may or may not be a co- incidence that the vocal cords in the Grays are nonfunc- tional or vestigial. (7,22) What made their vocal cords vestigial in the first place? Could the circumstances have contributed to their alleged telepathic abilities? 21. There are significant differences between Grays and humans with progeria. As mentioned earlier, the brains and eyes of humans with progeria are propor- tionately smaller than the brains and eyes of Grays. In children with progeria, there are short, dystrophic clav- icles, short fingertips. Progeria children have noses and external ears. Grays reportedly have proportionately longer arms and fingers, atrophy of the fourth and fifth digits, usually absence of toes (7) and oriental features. But in spite of all these differences, among them- selves, all humans with progeria look almost like clones, (4,5,15,23) regardless of their race or nationality. Among themselves, all Grays resemble each other, too, so much so that they also look like clones. (6,7) It would be ex- pected that progeria might show slight variations in its symptoms in two different species. Perhaps the Grays, not all of them, may not be clones at all, but still resem- ble each other because of their progeria? A lot of Grays may have to resort to cloning, since they are apparently incapable of reproducing in other ways. But not all Grays may be true clones. They may just resemble each other very strongly because of the way progeria manifests it- self. Most people with progeria very strongly resemble each other, almost to the point of looking like identical twins, even though they are not related to each other. 21. Although this disorder has many features that resemble premature aging, it also possesses many fea- tures that are not usually seen with normal aging. One feature that is found in progeria in human children that is not found in normal aging are the dystrophic clavicles. (27) From most UFO reports, there is not much evidence that the Grays have dystrophic clavicles, but there is sup- porting evidence, albeit circumstantial, that the Grays have other bony defects such as the absence of nasal bones, the hypoplastic fourth and fifth digits on the hands, the absence of thumbs, and the absence of toes. (6,7) Also, what both humans with progeria and Grays have that is not found in senescence are the brain changes that are associated with aging. (4,6,7,15) Most UFO abduction reports, if not all, show no evidence that the Grays are suffering from dementia. (2,3,22) LIVE ALIEN? There are rumors that a live alien died of \"unknown causes\" in captivity on June 18. 1952, at an age that was relatively young for his race. (20,21) There are also ru- mors that a live alien was taken from a UFO crash near Roswell. This is not in reference to Gerald Anderson's live alien, but rather to the capture of a live alien as told to Sheriff Wilcox's granddaughter by Mrs. Wilcox. (11) The EBE (Extraterrestrial Biological Entity) was al- legedly a UFO crash survivor. If the rumor is true, then what did the EBE die of? According to the rumors (ref- erence), the EBE was a Gray. (8,21) If the story is true that a Gray died of \"unknown causes\" in mid-1952 (20.21) then somebody died, who had most, if not all, the physical traits of progeria. Did the EBE die of some exotic extraterrestrial disease or did he die of Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome, a disease so rare on Earth that the Air Force doctors failed to diag- nose it? Progeria is^not easily diagnosed today, much less so in 1952. In 1952, this disease did not receive as much publicity as it does today, and fewer doctors were familiar with it, especially Air Force doctors not spe- cializing in pediatrics or rare genetic diseases. If the EBE had this disease, had it gotten out of control during the last year of its life? CAN GRAYS TREAT PROGERIA? j The symptoms of progeria seem to be exaggerated in the Grays (see previous list of symptoms), suggesting that Grays have a much more severe form of the disease. They have obviously found a way to treat it, because some of them grow up to be pilots and scientists and live beyond childhood, but how can they control a disease which is always progressive and always fatal in human children? Are all Grays healthy? If the Grays have prog- eria, can all Grays control their disease? Most reports from UFO abductees suggest that the Grays have an advanced medical technology. Can this advanced med- PAGE6 NUMBER 325 MAY 1995"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Len: This bone structure is based on the dimensions of an enlarged drawing in report #2 but with fingers spread to compare with drawing of human bones.

If they cannot cure it, can they stop its progression? We do not know if most Grays are healthy or not. But there is at least one report by abductee \"Lucille\" that all is not going well. (2) Lucille said that this alien society seemed to be \"millions of years old.\" She sensed that \"the society was dying, that children were being born and living to a certain age, perhaps pre-adolescence, and then dying.\" She said there was a \"desperate need to survive, to continue their race . . . Something had gone wrong genetically.\" (2) Most individuals with progeria die in their early teens or younger. Were the children that Lucille was referring to dying of progeria? Her abduc- tors were the Grays. (2) Another reference says that the Grays \"face extinction from incurable genetic diseases.\" (30)* * Matrix II by Valdamar Valerian (a pseudonym) is compiled of ma- terial from many difference sources, varying wildly in terms of place, time and credibility.

(6.7) As men- tioned above, Grays may appear to look like clones if they have progeria. The disease is such that most people with progeria very strongly resemble each other, as if they were twins, or at least came from within the same family. But a Gray with progeria is sterile, so he might have to resort to cloning if he wants to reproduce. If most Grays are products of clones, there could be other problems. Cloned species have a disadvantage in that the cloning process allows for increased DNA (deoxyri- bonucleic acid) replication failure. Matrix 11 says: \"It is thought by man that the Gray DNA structure is so de- graded that the species is functioning in more of an RNA (ribonucleic acid) basis. With RNA replication there is no cross checking capability during cell repro- duction.\" (30) This reference assumes that the Grays have DNA. Since the Grays are humanoid in appearance and are apparently complicated organisms, there is no reason to assume that they do not have DNA, which is located in the chromosomes inside the cell nuclei. These are the genes that are responsible for making amino acids, which are the building blocks of protein. (12,13) All organisms on Earth are made up of long chains of amino acids strung together, which are the proteins. Amino acids are naturally occurring com- pounds that have even been found in meteorites, which are indeed extraterrestrial. Amino acids are made up of four elements: oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and hydro- gen. These four elements are common throughout our solar system, and there is no reason to believe that they do not exist elsewhere in the universe. DNA AND RNA The DNA acts like a template, making another com- pound called RNA, similar to DNA. The RNA. in turn, acts as a template for making amino acids, which are the building blocks of the proteins. (12,13) When DNA does not replicate properly, it means that one or more of the DNA bases changes, or mutates. These mutations or changes in DNA bases can be caused by radiation or toxic substances, viruses, or any other thing that can cause damage of the DNA molecule. (24) If even one of the bases of the DNA molecule is changed, even slightly, it makes a different RNA. The mutated RNA. in turn, programs the wrong protein. The effects can be lethal or result in a serious disease. One example of this is sickle cell anemia. Progeria itself is thought to be a sporadic mutation in one or several genes. (4) That the Grays may have difficulty with DNA replication is suggested by the following quote from Matrix II: \"For the Grays, the main motivation for the genetic work with humans is the survival of the Gray species, which is genetically dam- aged. The Gray clones are abducting human fe- males...and using them for cross-breeding in order to produce a new hybrid species that does not have the in- herent genetic weaknesses of the Gray species.\" (30) The skin fibroblasts (those cells which give rise to connective tissue) of a young French boy with progeria have been examined and found to have reduced levels of \"messenger\" RNA. Even reduced levels of RNA, how- ever, indicate the presence of DNA, at least in humans. Examining the skin fibroblasts of Grays for reduced messenger RNA might give us a similar comparison ratio in terms of diagnosing progeria. Presumably, they could be directly tested to DNA, too. Unfortunately, there are no living specimens — or Gray cadavers — readily available for us to examine. HYALURONIC ACID Children with progeria also have abnormally high levels of hyaluronic acid (a viscous mucopolysaccharide acid). (4) The high levels of hyaluronic acid in the tis- sues or urine can be used as a marker for (he diagnosis of progeria. (4) It is not known whether Grays urinate. There is not much evidence to support this, but it should still be possible to show the presence or absence of hyaluronic acid in tissue studies from Gray cadavers. If the hyaluronic acid level is high, it might be additional evidence that the Grays have progeria. In humans, hyaluronic acid is present in the vitreous humor of the eyeball, the testes, and the umbilical cord jelly. It is present in other organs, too, but these are the or- gans that are most often removed in cattle mutilations. (20) Are the Grays using hyaluronic acid from these or- gans to make a template for an antihyaluronic antibody serum? Such a serum, if injected periodically, might keep hyaluronic acid from reaching dangerous levels. This would be analogous to a diabetic taking insulin every day to keep blood sugar from reaching dangerous levels. DO GRAYS HAVE PROGERIA? If Grays have progeria, then there is a very serious situation out there. An entire civilization may be threat- ened with extinction because their children and young people are dying. A possible reason why progeria may be so widespread among Grays and not among humans is probably because the Grays have been around much longer than humans and their DNA replication is proba- bly deteriorating, making room for genetic mutations and serious genetic diseases that resemble premature aging such as Hutchinson-Gilford Syndrome. One rea- son why they may want to hybridize with Homo sapi- ens is to add healthier DNA to their gene pool and to weed out the progeria gene. They may have a long way to go, because the progeria trait is probably dominant and not due to a recessive gene. (4) Half of all offspring born to a parent with progeria will have progeria. On Earth, most humans with progeria are sterile, but among Grays, this problem of sterility is probably PAGES NUMBER 325 MAY 1995"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL bypassed by cloning and in vitro hybridization. But if the Grays clone themselves, it will only further propa- gate the progeria gene. What this means is that if a Gray with progeria clones itself, its clones will also have the same genes as the \"parent.\" HYBRIDIZATION The next logical step would be to hybridize to weed out the progeria gene. The Grays would need to hy- bridize with a species genetically related enough to themselves in order to produce offspring. It is speculated that the Grays might be sterile and cannot produce eggs or sperm, therefore it is suggested that they might use other cells from their bodies to fertilize the human egg. Some hybrid children seem to have symptoms of progeria. (2,17,22) However, if the hybrid children are heterozygous as opposed to homogygous, they may have a milder form of progeria and their disease may be better controlled than that of a full-blooded Gray. Evidence that some hybrid children have progeria comes from several reports by UFO abductees who have claimed to have seen hybrid children. Kathie Davis, in the book Intruders, told Budd Hopkins: \"She's tiny. Thin. White hair...not a whole lot of it.\" Kathie later tells Budd that \"the hair was sparse and...that patches of scalp were here and there. She has really tiny, little tiny ears, but they're lower on the head than they should be...Forehead is a little big...\" Note that these are all symptoms of Hutchinson- Gilford Syndrome. Another abductee who saw a hy- brid has said: \"They look kind of old.\" (22) Another ab- ductee who also saw hybrid children said that they looked very ill, as if they were dying. (17) This last abductee was on television when she made this state- ment and appeared somewhat emotional. Have all these UFO abductees seen children with progeria? If the Grays have progeria, then the incidence among \"aliens\" is much higher than it is among humans. In the United States, a population of well over 200 million, only about ten children presently living have progeria. (28) By contrast, according to the controversial Roper Poll, almost four million Americans alone may have had an abduction experience, or something perceived as same. Most abductors are of the Gray race and de- scribed as \"progeroid\" in appearance. We have no way of knowing how many Grays have participated in how many abductions, but it certainly seems safe to say, if these numbers are to be believed, that the total must be several thousand, if not hundreds of thousands. If Grays do suffer from premature aging, then we will have to change our views on progeria to include the following: • Progeria is not as rare a disease as previously thought. • Progeria and the Grays are not mutually exclusive. • Progeria is probably a universal disease, existing on other worlds, if the Grays are indeed extraterrestrial biological entities. Undoubtedly, these conclusions can be disturbing if they turn out to be true. But it is better to face the truth rather than to run away from it. To my knowledge, the issue of progeria has never been addressed in the field of ufology, therefore this article has been submitted as an alternative proposal for the consideration of people in the medical discipline.

David Spencer, MUFON Deputy Director, Investigations UFO AND IFO The term UFO is intended to apply to observed objects which are not identified, have characteristics which can- not reasonably be attributed to known science or technical capabilities, and/or lack characteristics which are required or always observed with known science or technical capabilities. I make this clarification in order to prevent the re- sponse, \"I don't know what it was, so it has to be unidentified.\" It also avoids the retort, \"It doesn't look like a saucer to me,\" which results from using the original/Zymg saucer label. THE GRAY LINE OF OBJECTIVITY Investigations of claimed UFO sightings demand high objectivity. Any desire we may have for our in- vestigations to be of bonafide UFO sightings must not override our quest for truth. We must always be ready to ascribe plausible, mundane causes to apparently as- tounding events, contrary to our id. We must avoid pushing the evidence — as by discounting possible ex- planations — and search for down-to-earth, pragmatic causes. Theoretically, our being objective means that we have neither prejudice nor predisposition toward a con- clusion. It means letting the facts speak for themselves. Unfortunately, facts do not always speak for them- selves., During an investigation, the dividing line be- tween objectivity and the lack of it is not always clear, since the principal \"facts\" are the (biased) viewpoints of the witnesses. Most truisms regarding the event are statements which are given some degree of confidence, from the investigator's opinion, that the claims made by the witnesses accurately reflect their (subjective) inter- pretations of what they perceived. Combined with this, the information we report stems from our own interpre- tations of what we were told by the witnesses. Unintentionally, some of our own experiences and knowledge are factored into our reports, skewing our re- sults away from objectivity. (We should always ask the witnesses to write their own summaries of events and in- clude them with our own summary in our report. Since reviewers of our report will interpret the experience in slightly different ways, having both \"non-professional\" and \"professional\" interpretations gives a clearer picture of what happened.) Being objective does not mean we must validate all the facts and find all the answers. If we attempt to do so, we may never reach a conclusion, as illustrated through a recent claim: A large, low-flying, slow-moving, silvery (light-reflecting), ellipsoid-shaped object was observed one evening near a small town. The object had a cabin- like appendage on its bottom and 'produced a slight humming sound which was heard a mile or more away. The Field Investigator recognized this as the description of a blimp, but there were no events taking place that would require a blimp for overhead television coverage. Checking with the nearest airport having radar, over 50 miles away, he learned that the facility would not have seen the low-flying object. He also learned that there had been no flight plan filed for a blimp. None of the local advertising companies had any activity that evening. Other observers he located said they remembered seeing a blimp but did not pay much attention to it. He adver- tised in the newspaper without getting any better leads. He could have made estimates and measurements to get a better idea of the object's size and speed, but there were no measurement parameter^ that would show the object could not have been a blimp. There were no blimp hangar buildings in the vicinity, but that did not preclude the possibility of an incidental flyover. He could have called Goodyear, but it may not have been that company's blimp. (The Goodyear name had not been seen.) He decided he was fighting a losing battle trying to establish a firm conclusion. Should he stop or continue investigating? WHEN TO END THE INVESTIGATION Each investigator has an opinion of when it is time to end an investigation. For many, the investigation is over once statements have been obtained from the wit- ness(es). The investigator writes the report without fur- ther investigation. This type of report is like those we read in the wide assortment of books on UFOs, seldom containing more than trivial investigative details. The re- viewers must reach their own conclusions from biased information that strongly implies genuine UFOs. Although it is not always possible to obtain more conclusive, unbiased information, the Field Investigator should make an effort to do so. Most important, the in- vestigator should seek information that could lead to an IFO conclusion, since a UFO conclusion says the object could not have been an IFO. About 15 percent of the reports I have reviewed were either probable IFOs or contained insufficient data to say the sighting was probably not an IFO. Most of those having insufficient information usually contained only PAGE 10 NUMBER 325 MAY 1995"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Form I (UFO Sighting Questionnaire — General Cases), along with a few brief statements from the witness! es). A few reports I have reviewed contained the evidence of considerable investigation but no conclusive opin- ion. In one case, the investigation was continued be- cause an investigator sensed that a hoax was in progress. When is the right time to stop an investigation? The de- cision is yours to make, but let me offer a few guidelines: • If the description is obviously that of an identifiable object, it probably is. Attempt to confirm what you suspect. If you are not readily successful, it is still a probable IFO unless you get good evidence suggest- ing otherwise, such as maneuvers that are not possible with known technology. The probability that the event is explainable is considerably higher than the proba- bility it is not explainable. Include your rationale in your report. • If you sense the event is a hoax, trust your instincts and try to confirm them. (The MUFON Field Investigator's Manual, fourth edition, and the UFO Field Investigator's Training Guide both have dis- cussions on this subject.) If you believe but cannot confirm a hoax, even with the help of fellow investi- gators, your report can give the basis for your suspi- cions. • If the event has multiple characteristics that defy your knowledge of science, it could be due to a genuine UFO. Check with appropriate authorities and experts on details and with other Field Investigators for sug- gestions, if possible, then provide your arguments with your report. Opinions from other Field Investigators are valuable aids. They will either affirm your conclusions, expose aspects that could strengthen your logical arguments, or bring up questions whose answers may change your conclusions. Be open to opinions, and do not let your ego prevent you from reaching proper conclusions. HOW CAN 1 REACH A CONCLUSION? You should always make an effort to conclude with either a UFO, IFO, or hoax finding. The firmness of your conclusion may be strong or weak, depending on how closely it answers the claims made by the wit- ness(es). A simple list of all claims made can be used to test hypotheses. Every sighting investigated contains from about three up to twenty or more distinct claims made by the witness(es). The claims are identified as statements regarding each aspect of an experience. For example, consider the following sighting ac- count, derived from an actual reported case: \"I was awakened at two-thirty in the morning by a light flashing into my bedroom. I looked through my window and saw a bright oval light in the field behind my house. It had back-and-forth motion on the ground by the back fence line. Suddenly, the light shot straight up and changed to an illuminated disc on the clouds. It then disappeared in an instant. There was never any sound from it.\" Each claim is listed below and followed by major questions: (1) It was 0230 hours. (How did the witness know this?) (2) The light was seen in the bedroom. (Was the light shining on the wall?) (3) The light was viewed through the window. (Was the window open?) (4) The light was seen in the field behind the house. (Was the source of the light seen?) .  f (5) The light was oval-shaped. (Did it change any in size or shape?) (6) The light swung side-to-side. (How rapidly? What was the distance of the swing?) (7) The light was seen on the ground by the fence line. (Did it illuminate the fence?) (8) The light moved quickly upward. (How was this observed?) (9) The light appeared as a disc on the clouds. (Was a beam observed?) (10) The light instantly disappeared. (Did it dim out, move away, or simply vanish?) (11) No sound was heard from the light. (What other sounds were heard?) After interviewing the witness, observing the layout of the property, checking with the owner of the field be- hind the house, and following up on any leads obtained, the investigator might form an hypothesis. Perhaps a crew from the telephone (or power line or etc.) company had been searching for a downed line (or a blown trans- former or etc.), using a spotlight on the back of a truck. Once the search was over, the light could have been moved to its resting position (pointing upward) and then turned off. A closed window, environmental noises, and distance may have prevented the witness from hear- ing the truck and conversations between the crew mem- bers. Trees and brush may have obscured the view of the truck, the light source, and the beam. If this hypothesis cannot be confirmed, another hy- pothesis might include a helicopter, or someone with a flashlight. If the investigator runs out of hypotheses, other investigators might offer some suggestions worth considering. Even if none of the possible explanations are con- firmed, the evidence points to a probable IFO conclusion if none of the claims involves an unexplainable phe- nomenon. If the claims made by a witness can be an- swered by a possible sequence of ordinary events in- volving known phenomena or objects, the investigator's report should have an IFO or probable IFO conclusion.

By Sean Casteel D ebbie Jordan (under the pseudonym \"Kathie Davis\") was first introduced to the world as the subject of UFO abduction researcher Budd Hopkins' second book, Intruders, The Incredible Visitations At Copley Woods. The book came out in 1987 and spent several weeks on the bestseller list in competition with Whitley Strieber's Communion. Both Hopkins' and Strieber's books broke new ground that summer, and the field of UFO research has not been the same since. The story of Debbie Jordan's abduction by aliens and the presentation to her of a half-human,, half-alien hybird child that she was told was her \"own\" daughter and whom she named \"Emily,\" astounded both the UFO community and the public at large, and revealed what has continued to be a major reason offered for why the abduction phenomenon exists at all—for the sake of a genetic experimentation program conducted by the aliens for what continues to be unknown reasons. In 1994, Debbie Jordan shed her pseudonym and co- authored withjher sister Kathy Mitchell a new book called Abducted! The Stoiy of the Intruders Continues. The new book brings up-to-date the sisters' story since Intruders with a candor and a gentle wit that is rare in the literature of abduction accounts. I spoke to Debbie Jordan by phone from her home in Indiana and asked, first of all, what had motivated her to write Abducted! and go public a second time with new experiences. \"Well, when Budd went out to speak about Intruders. \" Jordan said, \"I would go with him. And all over the place, people kept asking me the same ques- tions and telling me about all of their experiences. And I felt sorry for a lot of them because they didn't have the support system I had. I had my whole family and my neighborhood behind me, and they were all by them- selves trying to deal with it. \"I felt that this would be the way,\" Jordan continued, \"to give back some of the support that I got. And maybe if I spoke up and told some of the weird stuff I'd seen and experienced, then other people wouldn't feel bad about talking about it and would come forward. Also, it helped me to put things down in writing. Like keeping a journal. It helped me deal with things.\" Kathy Mitchell, Jordan's older sister, also found it dif- ficult to come to terms with her own abduction experi- ences, especially in terms of writing about them for public consumption. \"Talking about the UFO subject outside of my family is still sort of a new experience for me,\" Mitchell said in a letter written during the research The Story of the Intruders CoMhnues, Copy Debbie Jordan & Kathy Mitchell Abducted! is published by Carroll & Graf of New York, 288 pages, illustrated, lib, $21.00. for this article. \"I had decided years ago that the subject was just best left alone. That position looks like a 'cop- out' now, but back in the mid-1960s it was the option of choice for most people. Now the media seems to be flooded by people from all walks of life with similar ex- periences, and sometimes it is hard to tell the real from the not-so-real. Unfortunately, the not-so-real experi- ences sometimes receive the same attention as the real and that tends to create stumbling blocks for anyone who comes forth with new information.\" When it came to actually sitting down and writing Abducted!, Jordan said that it had been difficult doing the work without Hopkins' help. \"I've never written anything in my life,\" Jordan said, \"other than, you know, school work and diaries and journals. I just wrote how I talk. That's why the English isn't that great. I just wrote how I talk.\" Hopkins did write the introduction to the book, how- ever, and offers the opinion in the book's opening pages that both the government and the aliens themselves are liars. I asked Jordan what her feelings were in regard to Hopkins' remarks. PAGE 12 NUMBER 325 MAY 1995"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL \"Well, I don't agree that everything is horrible,\" Jordan said, \"like Budd sometimes comes across as thinking. I know he doesn't always think that. Budd works in the 'emergency room' situation of the whole thing. He sees the people who are decimated by it and can't function in life anymore. That's why he feels so bad about it.\" Jordan went on to say that she did not credit either the extraterrestrials or the abduction experience for \"trans- forming\" her into a stronger person. \"I give credit to myself,\" she said, \"and the fact that I was forced into it because of these experiences. I was forced either to sink or swim. And I found something in- side of me that kept me going. I was motivated, I had kids to raise, and responsibilities, and somehow I man- aged to keep my head above. And now I can look back and say, 'Well, I wouldn't change my life, and if I had it to do all over again, I'd have these experiences again. Because they forced me into growing and changing for the better.' That doesn't necessarily mean the experience itself was a good thing.\" The experience has also left Jordan with what she calls an \"intuitiveness.\" \"Sometimes I wonder if it's a by-product of the way they communicate,'' she said. \"If how they communicate with me somehow triggers something in my mind and is something that has continued to grow whenever I depend on it or use it. The more I use it, the better it gets. I can't say they didn't do that. I don't know. I wonder about it. \"It's . . . like a 'knowing,'\" she went on, \"an under- standing. Sometimes I'll look at somebody and I'll get a flash as I'm looking at them. It's like a quick image or something. And I can 'feel' the kind of person they are. I'can 'feel' if they're not feeling good. It's hard to explain. With people I'm really close to, like my friends and my family. I can sit in the same room with them—and we can be totally quiet for five minutes— and then, all of a sudden, I'll start to say something. And they'll say the exact same thing at the same time. Or I'll turn to look at them and say, 'So what do you think of such-and-such?' And they'll say, 'Oh, I was just thinking about that.' It's just stuff like that. I think everybody can do it. But then there's the intuition part of it. If I get a bad feeling about something, if some- thing tells me 'Don't do that,' then I don't do it. My feelings are always pretty accurate. And the more I depend on it, the better it gets.\" F rom her own experiences with \"the psychic compo- nent\" of the abduction aftermath, Jordan next shifted to more recent experiences with another hybrid child. \"I remember seeing a little baby boy with dark eyes and dark hair,\" Jordan said, \"real tiny, at one time when I was with Emily. And I was holding the little boy, and I named him 'Andrue,' and spelled it a particular way. And) somewhere, I remember somebody saying there were nine. I wasn't sure exactly what that meant. I thought it meant there were nine more like him some- where that were mine. Or that there were nine more somewhere of these kids, and whether they were mine or not I don't know. It was a kind of confusing, weird, dreamlike state that I was in when I was holding this baby. And the older girl, Emily, was there with me, watching everything I did.\" I then asked what I consider to be the obligatory question on the religious and spiritual feelings an ab- ductee has about what they're going through. Again, Jordan did not disappoint. \"I said in the book that I didn't know whether I was receiving these 'messages' or 'thoughts,'\" she said, \"or I was 'remembering' them later, like they were told to me a long time ago somewhere else. But there was some religious—or probably spiritual is a better word— stuff to it, about God, what God is, and where I would find him. Stuff like that. They said God's not in Heaven high above everybody like everybody's been trained to believe. He's here within.each person. And everything that's alive and anything that has life or substance, that's what God is. These are the things I was told. I don't know the exact words, but that was the idea.\" And where does Jordan think the whole UFO/ab- duction complex is ultimately leading to? \"I feel there's going to be a time,\" Jordan said, \"when there's no more question anymore of 'Are the people that are telling these stories crazy?' I just feel like some- thing's going to happen that is going to blow the whole area wide open and the truth is going to start to come out. And it's going to be common knowledge. I feel a sense of anticipation like something big is going to hap- pen. I don't know what and I don't know when. But I feel it very strongly. I feel a connection with this par- ticular topic, UFO stuff and life elsewhere. Besides, it's always been what I feel is an evolution of the human psyche and the human spirit beyond this, and some- thing's going to happen.\" As our conversation drew to its conclusion, Debbie Jordan again voiced the hope that Abducted! will help others in similar circumstances. \"I just hope that what Kathy and I wrote will help people,\" Jordan said, \"who have had the experiences we have had. To help them deal with them, and to know that they can be okay and that they don't have to go crazy. There's a lot of people who understand and who want to help. And I'm just anxious for whatever it is that's going to happen to hurry up and happen so that, once and for all, people will stop ridiculing us and instead will say, 'Well, maybe there was something to that after all.'\" Sean Casteel is a freelance writer with an interest in UFOs.

The aircraft configuration comprises a circular disc-like airfoil-shaped wing struc- ture having a convex upper surface and a concave lower surface with a leading edge and a trailing edge. At least one thrust-producing unit is attached at each of the leading and trailing edges, respectively. A plurality of other thrust-producing units are mounted symmetri- cally about the circular wing structure. Each thrust- producing unit has attached thereto a thrust deflector assembly for angularly adjusting the thrust produced by the thrust-producing unit, thereby allowing the aircraft to fly both vertically and horizontally. A substantial volume of helium gas is stored encompassing the inner upper hull of the aircraft, thereby giving the flying disc greater lift capacity. The outer skin of the upper surface consists essentially of a plurality of solar panels for delivering power to a multiplicity of devices. 12 Claims, 17 Drawing Sheets vfJr^ o 3CQJ Tfrv? r ^Svjf'v-'V/V gj^-'S-iK . r A ,|a^i i' ' '• ! s.«s<f'2gfr s?/ r 'V f :\\$&^ \\ ,' ^^—f^^sj 5 •.-•/////'////////I//.'

A Bavarian immigrant, Neumayr says he first thought of the idea of a circular Hying ship 25 years ago. but was only able to work on it full time the last two or three. He was granted Patent Number 5.351.911 for a Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) Flying Disc on October 4, 1994. (See above and also the cover.) Neumayr's flying disk would be propelled by eight jet engines evenly spread around the perimeter, assisted by an internal helium compartment. Computer-controlled ex- haust events would determine vertical and horizontal flight. Size is variable, but a disk 200 feet in diameter could conceivably accommodate 1000 passengers and crew.

Aside from be- ing a militia leader, William Cooper is also a claimed Area 51 UFO expert, using the flying saucer claims to bolster his views about the New World Order. The saucers, he says are not alien in origin, but were in- vented first by the Nazis in WWII. He says the gov- ernment is stockpiling these craft in preparation for the staging of a mock alien invasion, which will draw hu- manity together and provide the excuse for abrogating our remaining human rights. Many of Cooper's UFO and New World Order claims are based on secret docu- ments he says he read while in the Navy, which Cooper has reproduced and published in numerous, often revised variations. — psychospy@aol.com TITLE: ARIZONANS FORMING MILITIAS TO OP- POSE PERCEIVED \"INVASION\" DATE: February 18, 1995 PUBLICATION: Las Vegas Review-Journal and Las Vegas Sun (Reprinted from The Arizona Republic) ST. JOHNS, Ariz.—From this remote, untidy city on eastern Arizona's high desert plains, William Cooper beams his anger to the world. Five nights a week, at 10 p.m., Cooper, one of the most widely known prophets of the growing \"patriot movement,\" rails at the federal government and talks of doomsday omens on his short wave radio broadcast. A \"New World Order\" is building like a thunder- head. Foreign troops under the control of the United Nations are training secretly on American soil. Black helicopters are shadowing patriots to spy on them. The military, the FBI, the president, the National Guard—almost anyone in uniform, it seems—are plot- ting to rob Americans of their civil rights and their guns. The key to fending off the impending assault, Cooper and others like him say, is to form private militias. And across Arizona and the rest of the nation, thou- sands of mostly working-class and rural folks are re- sponding. Many are gathering in home or at conventions, read- ing patriot newsletters, generating \"intelligence\" for Cooper's organization and others, communing through shortwave radio and computer. Some are training with weapons. Others are stock- piling supplies to ensure survival when the battle ignites. Civil-rights groups and law enforcement agents are nervous. They fear that the patriot movement will goad some extremists into violence against Jews, blacks or lawmen. Militia leaders scoff at this. But they acknowledge that they think the armed conflict against one-world government for which they're preparing is unavoid- able. \"You're cattle, Stupid cattle,\" Cooper told any skeptics among a crowd of 260 at a December patriot convention in Mesa. While stressing he doesn't endorse violence, Cooper warned \"Blood will be spilled in the streets of America. It's inevitable.\" E xactly where the militia phenomenon is heading ,is unclear. Like its 1980s precursors—the Arizona Patriots and Posse Comitatus—the movement may taper off and die in the boredom that overtakes conspiracy causes, especially when the coming apocalypse doesn't come. But the patriot brushfire to date shows no sign of burning out, finding kindling for its outrage in every news flash. The events that raked in militia recruits—the siege of Randy Weaver in Idaho, the raid on the Branch Davidians near Waco, Texas, the signing of gun-control laws—stick in their craws. Then there's President Clinton, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the Internal Revenue Service. \"People right now are freaked,\" said David Espy, who lives near Chino Valley, north of Prescott, and who has taken out newspaper ads advising people to form militias to battle government intrusion. \"They're thinking, 'That (the Waco group) could have been our church, could have been our children.'\" He and neighbors have set up communications net- works, including laying underground phone lines and buying flare guns. At one point, they considered ac- quiring homing pigeons as a bug-proof way to com- municate. They've scouted for unmarked helicopters thought to be spying for authorities or the United Nations. They've discussed what they would do if federal forces invaded their land. \"The standing joke where I live is, 'When they see smoke coming from my place, that's going to be the be- ginning of the battle,'\" said Espy, owner of an excavat- ing company. \"If all else fails, if you got your firearm, you can defend yourself, and you'll have a new government.\" Loosely organized militias have sprung up in at least 13 states, according to an October report by the New York City based Anti-Defamation League. The militias are strongest in Michigan, Montana, Colorado and Florida, and their goal is to lay \"the ground- work for massive resistance to the federal government and its law enforcement agencies,\" the report states.

ROSWELL S SMOKING GUN? by Walt Andrus T he hottest new material on the Roswell crash has been announced in London, England, by business- man Ray Santilli, managing director of The Merlin Group. In 1995, while researching early motion picture film of Elvis Presley in the United States, Mr. Santilli lit- erally stumbled across alleged film footage of the actual UFO crash at Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. Santilli claims that the veteran cameraman that he contacted regarding archive film of the late Elvis Presley was at one time employed by the U.S. military and that in 1947 he was flown from Washington. D.C., to Roswell to film the UFO crash. Returning to Washington, the cameraman in question (name and city of residence known to MUFON). retained a copy of the film, which is said to consist of 14 canisters of 16mm black and white motion picture film. Each can- ister of film is approximately seven minutes in duration and devoid of any soundtrack. Ray Santilli purchased the film in question and upon returning to England set about trying to have it authenti- cated and to consider the best ways in which to eventu- ally go public with it. Philip Mantle, MUFON Representative for England, shared rumors about such a film with the writer when I was speaking at Bristol University for the Seventh International BUFORA UFO Congress in July 1993. Mr. Santilli will show segments of the film and dis- cuss in greater detail exactly how he came into posses- sion of it and his attempts to analyze it during his pre- sentation to the Eighth International UFO Congress on Saturday, August 19, 1995, in Sheffield, England. It has been publicly reported that Mr. Santilli purchased the film for 100,000 U.S. dollars: therefore he is anxious to have it authenticated before proceeding with various merchandising endeavors. Philip Mantle, Director of Investigations for the British UFO Research Association (BUFORA), has made a very positive written proposal to Ray Santilli to con- duct an analysis of the film to determine its authenticity through Kodak (UK) in Hemel Hempstead, and Hasan Shah Films in London. In any such analysis of motion picture film or still photographs, the credibility of the photographer is the other half of the analysis in order to secure authentication. Mr. Mantle has asked permission to visit the photographer in the U.S.A. so that his testi- mony may be obtained and then invite the elderly gen- tleman to the BUFORA Congress in August as a guest. Mr. Santilli provided one copy of a seven-minute segment of the film to Philip Mantle for his inspection. The sequence appeared to be a field autopsy of one of the bodies lying on a slab with two men in white coats behind and facing the body, and a man in civilian clothes with his back to the camera. It could not be determined if the lo- cale was a field tent, a building, or inside a large truck bed. At no time did the camera focus in for a close-up. The quality of the film was poor. It was not only dark, but contained scratches, according to Mr. Mantle. While waiting for the photo analysis to be completed, the writer is reminded of several reports given to the late Leonard H. Stringfield by military personnel who claimed to have seen motion pictures of a crash re- trieval under the guise of a training film, but who were later told to forget that they had ever seen the film. As a reference of one such case, please refer to The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome, Status Report II: New Sources. New Data (Case A-9, page 15) published by MUFON in January 1980. Could this be the same film that Mr. Santilli purchased? When the cameraman expressed concern about pos- sible repercussions from the U.S. government for having sold the film to Mr. Santilli, the author phoned Ray in London and offered the services of our MUFON legal staff, composed of 32 attorneys nationwide. Mr. Santilli simply acknowledged our gesture, but hasn't officially requested MUFON's legal assistance. When Walt Andrus tried to telephone the photogra- pher, he was advised that \"the customer had requested that his number be non-published.\" Not to be rebuked that easily, one of our attorneys in the same city has vol- unteered to locate the photographer and obtain an inter- view if possible.

Mr. Andrus will conduct the opening and closing ceremonies and he will be the recipient of a special presentation on behalf of BUFORA for his ser- vices to ufology. This will be a great opportunity to not only view and evaluate this controversial film, but to meet Mr. Santilli in person and possibly the cameraman responsible for same.

There are a number of requirements in order to suc- cessfully undertake the analysis of the alleged Roswell film footage. They are: 1. A complete copy of all of the film (without ex- ceptions). This will be viewed by an historian to visually check the accuracy of the images depicted on the film to see if they are representative of that era (1947). An his- torian has yet to be appointed. 2. The serial numbers from all 14 rolls of film. Preferably, these to be cross checked visually by Philip Mantle in the presence of Ray Santilli or others from the Merlin Group. 3. A copy of all documentation surrounding this film (without exceptions) which should include the ''analysis\" already undertaken on behalf of Merlin, the coroner's re- port, etc, etc. 4. Actual film analysis. Two companies have now agreed to analyse the film. They are Kodak (UK) in Hemel Hempstead, and Hasan •Shah Films in London. The analysis at Kodak will be overseen by John Parsons-Smith, Managing Director, Motion Picture & Television Imaging. Kodak's requirements are as fol- lows: One canister of the film in question. Kodak has assured me that there will be no destructive testing of the film. In view of the sensitivity of the film, I would like to suggest that the film be hand delivered to Kodak (I will do this) and hand collected after the analysis. Alternatively, Merlin may wish to make their own arrangements with Kodak in order to deliver the film to them. The analysis at Hasan Shah Films will be overseen by Hasan Shah himself. Again, they require at least one canister of original film. Again, I can hand deliver and collect, or Merlin can make their own arrangements. To give you some idea of the type of work that this company can undertake, they will utilise the latest tech- nology to establish the age of the film stock by using computers, check nitrate levels, code numbers on the film, etc. Again, no damage will be done to the film, but they do require a number of frames from the leader of the footage which would have to be scratched in order to establish nitratre levels, but this would not damage the actual footage images. 5. Last but not least, any film footage or still photo- graph is only half of the story, the other half of course is the photographer. I would respectfully request that I be given access to speak to JB, the alleged photographer. I would like to offer him a place at the conference, but more importantly, from an analysis point of view, I would like to speak to him in person. I have the appropriate funds in order to visit him in the USA. in confidence if required. Until such a time that we have spoken to the reported photographer, doubt will be thrown on any analysis of the film irrespective of who conducts such an anlysis. I trust you will give due consideration to the above proposal. Only by the mutual cooperation of all parties involved will we ever be able to successfully analyse the Roswell film footage. — Philip Mantle Director of Investigations British UFO Research Association West Yorkshire, UK . . . and Stanton Friedman Challenge to Ray Santilli Subject: Purported Roswell crashed saucer and autopsy film footage. As the scientist who was the first investigator of the Roswell story and is still actively investigating it, I am very concerned that, despite the almost 4 months that have gone by since the first public noise about the footage, you have provided no evidence whatsoever to substantiate any of numerous claims . . . You claimed, in our first conversation back in mid- January, that the emulsion had been dated as of the right time frame: that you had been researching the case for over one year, and had all kinds of paperwork from the cameraman; that you had established that President Truman was in Dallas, Texas, when the autopsy took place, including checking with the Truman Library; that you didn't know who I was, despite my having co-au- thored what many consider the definitive book about MAY 1995 NUMBER 325 PAGE 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Roswell (Crash at Corona), besides publishing many pa- pers about Roswell and Majestic-12. When we met on April 4 in London, you claimed that cameraman JB was given 100,000 US dollars, but no receipt was ob- tained; that he is dominated by his wife, but that she didn't know anything about the deal. These both sound very unlikely. Surely </the film were genuine, you would have had it examined in detail by someone like me, who has been working on the story for more than 17 years, and by film experts. You would have provided as a minimum the fol- lowing data: 1. The make and model of camera used. 2. The type of film used and the actual dates of the filming. 3. Evidence in the form of a written report from Kodak or whomever supposedly determined the vintage of the film. 4. JB's military discharge papers — DD 214. 5. A set or two of military orders from the right time frame indicating where JB was assigned, names of associates, etc 6. A receipt for the $100,000. 7. Some kind of withdrawal slip showing from whence cometh the cash. Your small office gives no obvious indication that you would find it easy to lay your hands on that amount of money. 8. Evidence of a supposed showing to supposed reli- gious leaders. 9. Any evidence that the BBC ever intended to show the footage. 10. Evidence that there had been any contact with the Truman Library and any indication that Truman was in Dallas any time during the period of July 1 to September 30, 1947. The Library tells me he wasn't in Texas. 11. Any evidence that your effort is other than an attempt to spread disinformation to discredit Roswell . . . similar to the OS Air Force attack on Roswell in September, 1994 . . . similar to the Doug and Dave Faked Crop Circle nonsense of several years back. up. In short, it seems to me that you should put up or shut —Stanton Friedman New Brunswick Canada As we go to press, word is that Mr. Santilli is supposed to have shown his film at an invitation-only screening at the Museum of London on May 5, 1995 — Ed. LATEST WORD As of 5:30 pm Atlantic Time on May 5,1 have now spoken with three individuals present at the Museum of London showing of the infamous Ray Santilli \"Roswell Film Footage\" with about 57 other persons, mostly from the media. The showing was late in beginning and my UK Lecture Agent, Dan Silver, who had previously met with Santilli, distributed copies of my challenge to those present. The film, consisting of 16 reels of three minutes each, was all shot badly in poor focus in one location, wherein an autopsy was supposedly being done. Harry Truman was definitely not present, no faces of the more or less space-suited \"doctors\" could be seen. The \"alien\" had 4 fingers and a thumb, 4 toes and a big toe, no hair, relatively large eyes, and skin that was peeled back like latex, which it very likely was. A saw was taken to the skull and a \"brain\" was removed. Santilli refused to answer questions and had the gall to distribute copies of the three early MJ-12 documents with a cover letter with the appropriate heading of International Exploitation. Attendees were not supposed to bring in recording equipment. None of my informants thought that those assembled thought the footage was real or would pay much money for the privilege of showing it. Monday is a bank Holiday in the UK, so most press coverage from the multinational group will probably not appear before Tuesday. I expect to find out a good deal more from a hidden recording device and during my visit to England for a lecture on Saturday, June 3, arranged by Mr. Silver. MUFON's UK representative. Philip Mantle was present, as was Kent Jeffrey and a representative of Operation Right to Know. One possible anachronism in the silent film was a wall telephone with a coiled cord. Two people are check- ing as to whether such items were in use in 1947. — Stanton Friedman Circles in Carpet? See letter bv Joe Burron on page 20. PAGE 18 NUMBER 325 MAY 1995"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Letters to Mufon UFO Journal UFOS & EGOS It has been observed by more than one commentator on the UFOlogical scene that there seems to be no shortage of inflated egos among the spokespersons for the sub- jects of UFOs and extraterrestrial/interdimensional in- telligences. And it is almost a truism that any position taken on a topic in UFOIogy will be passionately upheld by one group, and often mercilessly argued against by persons holding different positions. The inference that is drawn from these comments is that there is a dispro- portionate abundance of self-impressed spokespersons for UFOIogy. This raises the question: what is there about the UFO/ET subject which lends itself to the inflation of the egos of so many who take on the subject? And, is there any hope that such ego-driven \"discourses\" in UFOIogy will give way to more dispassionate and thoughtful di- alogue any time soon? A possible explanation for this passion lies in the very topic of UFOs. An examination of same reveals a number of facets which deeply touch upon human sensitivities. The question of whether UFOs or ETs exist, given widespread but ambiguous indications, raises the fun- damental question of how we know, and whether we can know, something for which the evidence is not clear. This fundamental epistemological question raises anxi- ety in many about how firm is our own grasp on reality. And one mechanism humans have found, when dealing with such anxiety, is to raise the volume or emotional pitch of the argument in direct proportion to the degree of anxious uncertainty which one is experiencing. The issue of whether extraterrestrials are more like us, or more strange, or essentially unknowable, likewise is sure to garner passionate proponents for every side of the question. Again, the emotional energy for this debate comes from the fundamental question of just how unique are we in the universe, or is our attainment of conscious intelligence a fairly common occurrence (although in various forms)? Those whose sense of self-worth comes from feeling proud to be among a species at the pinnacle of evolution will poorly tolerate any suggestion that there is abundant intelligent life, or even life which is more intelligent, elsewhere. Then there are Cosmic Liberals, who argue that intelligence must be distributed broadly throughout the universe, even though they have not seen any per- sonal evidence of the latter. They state this because their certainty comes from their projection of \"political correctness\" onto God, or Nature, or whatever they hold to be the source of being for the universe. The idea that intelligence elsewhere might take a form which humans would have no mental category for, or even would not know how to access properly, is distressful and/or preposterous for some people. Others are ready to proudly tout such paradoxes, to squelch what they see as the smug assertions of the other side. Another question certain to raise the temperature of discourse is whether extraterrestrials are mostly decent, honorable beings; or whether the aliens are crafty, dis- honest, devious or even sadistic creatures? In the hun- dreds of discussions on this debate, the debating parties often argue with a passion which reveals that this is not just another anthropological (or exo-zoological) dis- cussion, but a point which the discussants feel they can- not afford to lose. Why is this? In many cases, it seems that some speakers are deriving their opinions not from scientific analysis, but from samples of cases which of- ten contain uncanny consistencies of reported extrater- restrial behavior. Here, once more, the psychological push to prevail on this topic can be traced to its implications for us as a hu- man race. For, if the ETs are evil, we are doomed (or worse). But, if the ETs are good, then this is vindication that the Cosmic Liberal viewpoint (that all intelligent life is basically good) has galactic-wide applicability. The message here is fairly straightforward. When we consider the ETs, we are essentially considering our- selves. (This probably happens unconsciously.) Our in- terpretations or predictions about ETs are often projec- tions of our own feared, or hoped for, inner nature. Such characterizations of the ETs often tell the listener more about the speaker's personal mindset than about the ver- ified nature of the extraterrestrials and their intentions. What will it take to consider the ETs on their own terms? To do so requires a selflessness which many philoso- phies, including Taoism, consider to be the beginning of wisdom. For we cannot truly learn about another person or race if we are busy imposing our own perspective on them. But, operating selflessly, we can open ourselves to experience the Visitors without presuppositions. And what will it take for ego-driven spokespersons within UFOIogy to develop more measured and humble discourse? Again, that same selflessness, of which the Tao Masters spoke of with such appreciation. The finest respect one person can give another is to observe them carefully and see them for who they really are. Can we begin to bring this level of respectfulness to our relations with the extraterrestrials? And can UFOlogists dare to bring this level of truth and candor to their relations with each other? Recently, an international group of professional UFOlogists began a dialogue, and included in their cir- cle a liaison to an intelligence agency which deals with UFO matters. While certainly controversial, daring, and subject to criticism, such ego-less willingness to consider the viewpoint of others, (in this case, the liaison), from the standpoint of the other, may be a very timely skill. This skill will be one which we will need in abundant MAY 1995 NUMBER 325 PAGE 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL measure, as we reach out to understand fellow intelligent extraterrestrial lifeforms who have come to visit. — Dr. Richard Boylan Sacramento, CA CARPET CIRCLES? Now I know how the abductees whom I have inves- tigated feel when they say, \"I know you won't believe me, but...\" I have read considerably about the crop formations. However, I have never heard of carpet formations. Nowhere in any UFO material, have I seen anything close to what happened in my house. On 6 April, 1995,1 vacuumed my house thoroughly. My wife died in April of 1993, and she was a meticulous housekeeper. Since her death, 1 have had people in to clean the house, but they really didn't satisfy me. So, I re- sorted to doing it myself. I live alone, so it's no big deal. At about 6AM on 7 April, I was reading the paper in the family room when I heard a very loud noise...like a baseball hitting the side of the house. I really thought that a car had run into the building. I looked all over the place, but, found nothing unusual. I went back to reading the paper. After finishing the paper, I took my exercise which ends up with a jog in place in the living room for about 2-3 minutes to exercise the heart. That was when I noticed the first ring. I thought that was rather unusual as, if you remember, I had vacuumed the previous after- noon and I hadn't seen the ring. However, although puz- zled, I didn't see any significance yet. When I went into the dining room. I found another ring. Now that in- trigued me. One, OK, two, wait a minute! So, 1 got curious and started looking all over the house. In one small bedroom I found three identical circles. The rings were 7 inches in diameter, the inden- tation approximately an eighth of an inch wide and a quarter of an inch deep. A better way of describing them would be if you took a bucket, placed it open side down and exerted a lot of pressure and then pulled the thing off. I took out my camera and took some pic- tures, included in this letter. Unfortunately only one photo came out real clear due to my using too much light, but it is clear enough to give you an idea of what they looked like. It took from the 7th to the 25th of April for the carpet to return to its original position. I'm at a loss as to how and why this happened. I've discussed the formation with some of my con- temporaries and we can come to no conclusion. One of my friends suggested, since there were five rings, some- one was telling me to go to the Olympics. Well, it's better than nothing. I talked it over with another friend of mine who has a layman's view of UFOlogy. He's a Psychiatrist. He is the one who did the work on the five AWOL soldiers from Germany a few years back at the Naval Aerospace Medical Center (NAS) in Pensacola. His explanation: Many times, the subconscious will generate activity over which we have no knowledge or control. I had given him a copy of \"The Holographic Universe,\" and he was fascinated by it and offered another view: In holography, as our minds assume control over the phys- ical, we are able to do many strange things which defy logic. For example: The fakirs who can suspend heart action, those who walk on hot coals without damage and so on. He suggested that, somehow I was capable of constructing the rings subconsciously without even re- alizing what was happening. We don't agree here. My explanation: As a result of the loud noise, and finding the rings, contact was established with me by some en- tity which, at this moment, is a mystery to me. In the past, I have heard female voices in the house, when I was alone, my recorder, on several occasions, talked to the caller in a female voice. My brother, who lives in New Orleans, called me twice when I wasn't home and heard a female voice telling him to leave a message. Several friends have had the same experience with my phone. I've had very loud knocking at the front door and upon examination, found no one there. I'm consistently hearing strange noises at awkward times in addition to a soft rumble of the house as though a train is going by. The closest train tracks are in Pensacola, and we are separated by a three-mile-wide bay. Now, before you start thinking that I'm senile or plain nuts, most of us, the members of the Gulf Breeze Research Team who are actively engaged in sky watch- ing and recording UFOs, including conducting investi- gations, have all had similar experiences. I'm not alone. Some of these members have had experiences much more bizarre than mine, for example, energy balls, fuzzy balls, in their home, ET's creating pranks and visits, and many more different types of aliens and \"creatures\" who visit them day or night. Something is happening here and it's getting worse. — Joe Barren Chief Investigator Pensacola/GuIf Breeze MUFON I'm afraid carpet circles are a new one on me, too! A couple of months back, however, my mother came across a grass circle in Fort Worth, where she lives. One of her cats lives down the block and around the corner in a neighbor's garage, and she walks down every morning and evening to feed it. The yard had not been mowed in some time (I think the neighbor had just recently died), so the grass was fairly high. The \"circle\" was actually an oblong shape, about eight feet across at the wide axis. The edges were fairly rough, and the grass inside the oblong looked like it had been pressed down in a random pattern, as if by a blower perhaps. In the center of the oblong shape, however, was a perfectly round circle about six or eight inches across, and the individ- ual grass stalks in this circle were flattened deeper than the surrounding area, and looked like they had been \"combed. \"I don't have an answer for that one, either!

It is visible in the SW at dusk and sets later about 12:30. Jupiter (-2.6), in Ophiuchus, reaches opposition to the Sun on the 1st, rising at that time in the ESE at sunset and remaining in view low in the southern half of the sky all night. The largest of-the planets lies 5° N of the reddish star Antares on the 14th, the 2nd of 3 conjunctions between the pair in 1995. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus (-3.9) rises about 4 AM in the NE and stays quite low in the E at dawn. The brilliant world can be seen near the cres- cent Moon on June 26. Jupiter doesn't set until sunrise early in the month. It begins to set earlier after that. Look for it only 2° S of the full moon on the 12th. Saturn (1.2), in Aquarius, now rises about 1 AM (midmonth) in the E. The ringed planet stands in the SE at dawn. Moon Phases: First quarter — June 6 Full moon — June 13 Last quarter — June 19 New moon — June 27 The Stars: The celestial meridian divides the night sky into springtime stars in the W (Leo, Bootes, Virgo) and summer stars in the E. That welcome sky symbol of the season, the Summer Triangle, is now fully visible in the E after evening twilight ends. Scorpius, with its red heart Antares and winding tail (complete with a stinger on the end), begins its seasonal foray across the southern horizon. Jupiter lies above Antares. Almost overhead is Hercules with his four-sided \"Keystone.\" Below him stands Ophiuchus the Serpent Bearer, shaped much like a big Arab tent. In the NW the Big Dipper starts its downward arc in the sky, and the hard-to-see sprawling outline of Draco the Dragon coils between the Big and Little Dippers and Hercules.

NATIONAL UFO AWARENESS WEEK Virginia Tilly, Public Education Director, has an- nounced that National UFO Awareness Week is sched- uled for August 12 through 20, 1995. Start planning your exhibits and arrange for display locations now. RESEARCH PROPOSALS The Mutual UFO Network has joined with the Center for UFO Studies and the Fund for UFO Research in a coalition that will solicit for research proposals. The members of the coalition council will pass judgment on the proposals submitted and then fund worthy projects with monetary grants. The objective of all three groups is to move the study of UFOs more toward science us- ing the general protocols of the scientific method. Scientific research projects will receive highest priority, followed by public education projects, and then fol- lowed by general special projects. This is an opportunity for scientists, engineers, and academics to explore ideas, theories, and studies that could lead to the resolution of the UFO enigma. Proposal forms may be secured by writing to any of the three above named organizations or to Thomas P. Deuley, 103 Oldtowne Road, Seguin, TX 78155-4099. NEW FIELD INVESTIGATOR'S MANUAL The much awaited fourth edition of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual was available for shipment on March I, 1995. It is nearly a complete revision, with an entirely new format, compared to the third edition which had been accepted as the standard manual in the English-speaking nations. It is composed of 24 sec- tions, some having several part numbers, and authored by a vast contingent of outstanding UFO researchers and investigators. The 311-page manual is being delivered in a 3-ring loose leaf hardback notebook. Edited by Walter H. Andrus, Jr., the manual is re- spectfully dedicated to Jerold R. \"Ron\" Johnson and Dan C. Overlade, Ph.D., for not only their personal contributions to the manual, but their individual dedi- cation to resolving the UFO phenomenon. Due to the manual's size and weight, special mailing envelopes were purchased for shipping. The price to MUFON members has been set at $25 plus $3.50 for postage and handling, whereas non-current members may obtain the new manual for $35 plus $3.50 for p. and h. The same price will apply in foreign countries. May I personally thank everyone for their patience while the new manual was being produced, since it did create a hardship and handicap in conducting field in- vestigator training classes. A grateful thanks is also ex- tended to all of the authors who wrote specific sections for the manual. This was an accomplishment that no one person could fulfill, since each section was written by an authority in the particular field involved. I am confident that the waiting was justified. The fourth edition of the manual is truly a state-of-the-art production which will make everyone very proud. Many of you purchased the MUFON Field Investigator's Training Guide authored by T. David Spencer, Deputy Director of Investigations, which is an outstanding adjunct to the new manual for instructors as well as students. MUFON headquarters has discontinued selling the Training Guide, however, limited quantities may be acquired by ordering same from Austin MU- FON, c/o Lemoine Pittman, Sr., Route 1, Box 20-C, Spicewood, TX 78669 for $30 plus $3.50 for postage and handling. Make the check payable to Austin MU- FON. Do not order the Guide from MUFON in Seguin. OBJECTIVITY - Continued from Page 11 there are multiple, independent witnesses of the same event and claims made by some witnesses are explain- able while those by others are not, the investigator should seriously consider a probable IFO conclusion and try to understand why claims made by some witnesses dis- agree with this conclusion. A UFO conclusion applies to cases for which an IFO conclusion is unreasonable given the circumstances. This can happen if there is something about the event that cannot be explained by any IFO hypothesis and there is high confidence that the unusual aspect oc- curred as claimed. WHAT IF THE REPORT IS INCONCLUSIVE? I receive some reports which I believe need additional support from data and the investigator's analysis. When this happens, I write a request for that information and a date by which I expect to receive a response.* If I do not receive a reply, I must study the claims made and build hypotheses. Occasionally, I am forced into concluding that the report contains insufficient information to take either an IFO or UFO position. Only reports having a UFO conclusion are entered into MUFON's computer UFO report database. Basic reference data for all other reports are included in a separate MUFON computer database. File folders for the permanent files are marked according to the disposition of the report. * I very much appreciate a response, even if it is to ask for a delay or to tell me the information cannot be obtained. A telephone call is ad- equate to request a delay, but it is not suitable for providing infor- mation for the report. I need the final response in writing so the report can be complete and self-supporting, reducing guesswork when the information is later used for UFO research.
