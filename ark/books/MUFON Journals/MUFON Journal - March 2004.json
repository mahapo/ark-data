Witness: Mrs. Evelina Kuss, inter- viewed July 19,2003 Interviewed by: Nancy Talbott (follow-up of original interview by Rob- ert Bernatowicz) Translator: SlawekParuszewski Field samplers: Milosz Kuss. Robert Bernatowicz Materials sampled: Black/green \"stone\" and soils Analyses by: Nick Reiter (SEM/EDS); Phyllis Budinger (infrared spectroscopy) The event Mrs. Kuss, a grandmother who has lived in this very rural area in central Po- land all of her life, has a bedroom on the ground floor of the farmhouse. Her large windows look out across a country road to her farm fields which extend 150-200 meters, ending in an approximately lOm-long area of wild grasses, behind which is forest. There are only a few other farmhouses in the area and few people. Mrs. Kuss reports that it was about 2 AM (in July or perhaps early August) and she couldn't fall asleep: \"I don't know why, but I couldn't. And suddenly the room simply became all red ... the whole room became red because there was something glowing outside the window. \"I saw this object in the sky. It had the shape of an ellipse and glowed in red, a very intense red.... And it was very slowly lowering itself onto the field. The glow from this thing was enormous. The whole object was emitting such light that it re- minded me of a bright ball, but with a dis- tinctive shape inside the glow. And it was going down, very, very slowly.\" At first Mrs. Kuss thought it might be a meteorite, but realized it couldn't be be- cause it was descending so slowly. Some- times it even \"stopped\" for awhile and would then continue its descent. The object, which was about 150 meters away from her, appeared to be 3-4 meters across. \"I think it could have been March 2004 several meters in length ... I saw it very clearly, it wasn't very far away, glowing like a piece of [hot] iron. There had been wheat [in the field] which my son had sown, but it had been reaped al- ready. And I thought that, since this fire landed there, the field might catch on fire from it. I even wanted to wake up my fam- ily, but the light began to dim. It was dimming out very, very slowly. I saw that noth- ing was on fire, so I went to bed, and in the morning dur- ing breakfast I told my family about it. I said that this object had landed there. And I showed them exactly where it landed.\" Mrs. Kuss reports that about 15 min- utes elapsed from the moment she first saw the red glow in her bedroom until the object landed and became so dim she could no longer see it. She continued to observe the field for about another hour before finally going to bed. She reports that she noticed no unusual smell and experienced no tin- gling of the skin or other possible elec- -n a Evelina Kuss tromagnetic effects, and she doesn't re- call hearing any unusual animal noises. The object itself was silent. There are no street lights in her area, and none of the lights in her house (or the radio or TV) were on, so she is unaware of any electrical interference which may have been caused by the object. The only clock observed in the house was hand wound. Retrieval of stone After hearing his grandmother de- scribe the events of the previous night, Mrs. Kuss' grandson Milosz, after at- tending to his chores, walked down to the end of the field to see if he could find any traces of the event the night before. At the end of the plowed field there is a 10-meter-long area of wild grasses & bushes before the forest. Milosz saw no sign of anything having been burned, but found approximately 10-15 \"stones\" placed on top of the grasses in an \"ir- regular\" circle or ellipse. \"I knew straight-away that they had to have something to do with the object,\" said Milosz. \"There were several of them ...mostly the size of a basketball, maybe slightly smaller....They made an irregular circle. They were scattered somewhat ir- regularly, as if by chance...or as if some- one had put them there delicately. Their weight pressed the ground beneath them a little. \"There were no traces of anything Mrs. Kuss' drawing of the glowing object she witnessed. MUFON UFO Journal Page3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"burnt. There was this smallest stone in the middle and I took it immediately. But the other stones were very heavy, and I couldn't lift them [Milosz was 11 years old at the time]. They were dark green in color, like a green glass bottle, and they were somewhat oval in shape...as if some- thing solidified in huge drops. Their color was exactly the color of the stone 1 took.\" Milosz brought the one \"smaller\" stone back to the house and told the family what he had found. A day or two later he took a wheelbarrow with him down to the end of the field in an attempt to retrieve the rest of the \"stones.\" But when he got to the site, the stones were no longer there. When asked if people could have taken the stones, he was certain that this was very unlikely: \"People? I don't think so...this is a wild, uninhabited place. Nobody walks here. Who would go into our field and take such heavy stones? I don't think they were taken by people, but rather by an object similar to the one that landed here.\" When I questioned Milosz's parents they confirmed that there were very few residents in the area, and that the only people who ever went into their fields were themselves when they had to work to do. Other farmers in the region would have all been busy with their own crops, and the family knew of no one who might have even known about the UFO sight- ing, or the existence of the \"stones.\" Milosz reported additional details about the stones, in particular that the stone he had retrieved glowed. \"This is the most important part....I noticed the following night...that this stone gives away a delicate glow in the night. I mean, the light was greenish, and only the edges were giving away the light. They [the lights] were like small glowing flames, or sparkles ... it's hard to describe, but it was amazing.\" When asked if the whole edge of the stone was glowing, he said that the stone had sharp edges all over it, and that the \"glowing points were on the edges.\" He reports that it continued to glow at night for about half a year and then stopped. Milosz also clarified that some of the stones were as big as cinder-blocks, with some rough edges like the smaller stone he retrieved, and all a dark greenish color. The stone he recovered is now more black than green, but it has multiple light-green inclusions (which are visible in good light). Since it appears that these may have been fluorescing when the rock was first recovered, this may be why he describes the stones as basically green, rather than black.

The family dis- cussed the sighting with a few people locally, but found that their story was laughed at, and they were not taken seri- ously. Initial investigation In the summer of 2000 a photo of a large crop circle which had been found in a field in the nearby village of Wylatowo appeared in many Polish newspapers- attracting the attention of Warsaw radio reporter Robert Bernatowicz. Bernatowicz, who is the head of The Nautilus Foundation (a group interested in unexplained phenomena), visited Wylatowo to examine the crop formation personally, and soon met Milosz Kuss. Once acquainted, Milosz related the story about his grandmother's sighting and his retrieval of the \"stone\" from the field. Bematowicz followed up with in-depth interviews with Milosz, Evelina Kuss, and others in the area, documenting as many details as he could. Needing access to more sophisticated technical analyses than he could find in Poland, Bernatowicz eventually contacted the BLT Research Team Inc. in the U.S. for assistance. In addition to requiring pieces of the stone for analysis, BLT requested that soil samples be taken from the area where the stone had been found, and these were provided by Milosz during the late spring of2003: A surface soil sample (down to a depth of 4 inches) was taken from the grassy area where the rock had been recovered, as well as control soil from the plowed field up closer to the farmhouse. The rock pieces and soils were then shipped to the BLT office in Cambridge,'MA. Laboratory Analysis: (SEM/EDS) On June 3,2003, two rock fragments were submitted to BLT consultant Nick Reiter of the Avalon Foundation, for scan- ning electron microscopy/electron disper- sive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) and other examinations. A few weeks later, soil samples were also submitted. Mr. Reiter's Lab Report follows: Physical Form: The two glassy stones are shown in the photo above, right. As may be seen, the larger sample (before being later split in two) was ap- proximately 1.2 cm long; the smaller was slightly less than 1 cm. Both are seen to be of similar color, a very dark green-black. March 2004 i:\\lWV \\ We also observe that small (< 2mm) bubbles and voids are present in both, consistent with the immediately apparent notion that these samples are essentially glass. EDS and Comparative Analysis: EDS scans taken from assorted spots on both stone samples are quite consistent. We find Si (silicon), 0 (oxygen), Al (aluminum), Mg (magnesium), Ca (calcium), K (potas- sium), and minor amounts of Fe (iron) and Ti (titanium). Other Properties: (1) No noticeable radioactivity was observed upon testing with a Geiger counter; (2) No fluorescence was observed in the visible portion of the spectrum when samples were exposed to both long-wave and short-wave UV. (3) Neither sample was magnetic. Discussion: Two analogous materials may be found which resemble these samples. 4 A semi-precious gemstone origi- nally derived from ancient meteoric glass in the region of the Moldau River-called Moldavite-resembles our samples some- what in form, but not necessarily in color, as Moldavite is usually a brighter and lighter green. * However, the samples do very much resemble vitrified soil, produced by a well-known toxic or nuclear waste remediation process known as ISV (in-situ vitrification). In this process electrical arcs are made to flow deep into soil areas contaminated with toxic wastes or radioactive sub- stances, liquifying the soil components and producing a non-permeable glassy material as the liquid soils cools. This glassy residual can then either MUFON UFO Journal remain safely underground (since the toxic wastes are now contained) or can be subsequently safely hauled away. Additional Testing: The observation by the original discoverer of the glassy rock, indicating a long-term phosphores- cence or fluorescence, continued to in- trigue us. We requested additional samples, specifically from the lighter-green \"veins\" reported to be vis- ible in the stone, and in December, 2003, did receive an additional small (< 2mm diam.) light green glassy shard for analy- sis. EDS revealed the composition of this new sample to be quite similar to the samples already examined; however, SEM photography revealed that'this shard was quite \"foamy\" in appearance, infused with tiny air-bubbles and voids, typical for ceramics. These air bubbles are thought to account for the overall much lighter green coloration in some areas of the re- trieved stone. The new sample was also examined under long-wave and short-wave UV lamps, but no fluorescence was noted. This suggests that the original \"lumi- nous\" quality reported by the rock's finder was short-lived and non-reversible. This sample was also examined by Geiger counter, with no rise in count rate over ambient noted. An anecdote from this researcher's past, though, may be germane. In years past I had worked at a major glass com- pany in Toledo, OH, as a technician in- volved with vacuum depositing of coat- ings on large-area glass sheets. One of the materials we coated onto glass was a thin film of fused silica (Si02) as a wear-resistant coating. The process was performed in a huge vacuum cham- PageS"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"her, where silica sand was evaporated by electron beam sources. Regularly we would have to shut the system down af- ter a production run and go inside the cavern-like chamber to clean off the cool- ing shields and chamber walls. One anomaly that we observed, which was never adequately explained, in- volved a faint greenish glowing of the flakes of \"over-spray\" glassy fused silica on the tool chamber walls. On one occa- sion we observed this faint glowing up to 24 hours after shutting the evapora- tion sources down. Thus, although the reported anoma- lous glowing of our fused glassy rock sample over a period of months is extraor- dinary, I have personally observed the glowing of vaporized and condensed fused silica for periods of multiple hours. Perhaps some analog is present. Soil Samples: Two soil samples, re- quested by BLT Inc. in the spring of 2003, were obtained in May, 2003; these were received in the lab on 30 June, 2003. One sample was taken from the grass area where the rocks had been found, and a control was obtained about 25m away from the middle of the plowed field. Both soil samples were dug down to about 4 inches into the soil. EDS analysis of granular soil tends to be somewhat problematic, due to the physical heterogeneity of such samples (except in the case of fine clays). \"Dirt\" is a complex material, and usually requires several EDS scans from each sample to get an idea about overall composition. Examination of the soil sample taken from the grassy area where the rocks were found shows a sandy or coarse-grained silty soil. EDS shows normal soil ingredi- ents, primarily Si, 0 and Al; with Ca, K, Fe and Mg seen as minor peaks. EDS of control soil taken 25m away is ratiometrically similar to the rock-area soils, with very similar signals of Si, Al (which is slightly elevated over the rock-area soil), 0, Ca, K, Fe and Mg, but with traces of Mo (molybdenum) and P (phosphorus) which were not seen in the rock-area soil. Laboratory Analysis (infrared Spec- troscopy): On July 8,2003, a fragment of the \"stone\" retrieved from a farm field in Poland in 1998 was submitted to Phyllis Budinger, Frontier Analysis Ltd. Labora- tory, for additional infrared spectroscopy analysis. Mrs. Budinger's report follows: Procedure: The dark \"stone\" fragment is approximately 9 x 7 x 2mm and weighs 0.2358 grams. An infrared spectrum was taken of a tiny amount of ground material SEM photomicrograph (100 X) of small lighter green glassy shard shows multiple tiny air bubbles in sample. (SEM Image by Nick Reiter.) removed from the fragment, using the Harrick SplitPea Tm accessory on the Nicolet Avatar 360 spectrometer. Stereomicroscope photographs were obtained using the Leika GZ6 microscope interfaced to a Kodak Digital Science MDS 120 camera. Results: Microscopic analysis shows the material has a glassy appearance with some apparent bubbles. This would sug- gest the material has been exposed to a temperature high enough to cause \"melt- ing\" of the mineral silicate in the sample. (See infrared analysis, below, on the identification of glass-like Si-O bonds, and Nick Reiter's report, above). The infrared spectrum of the \"stone\" fragment shows very broad absorption bands which are typical of an amorphous glass-like substance. The frequencies of the bands (between 1050-900 cnr 1 and between 550-400 cm' 1 ) are definitely due to Si-O absorption. The spectrum is a close comparison to a spectrum of lava, which is rock that has experienced melting. 1 These data suggest that the rock fragment originally contained a high concentration of silica mineral (i.e., sand-a.k.a. quartz) that has been subjected to high temperature. Glass (manufactured from 75% silica plus other materials) requires temperatures of at least 700-800C (1300-1500 F) in order to become glass. 2 'Specimen is from Mauna Loa, Hawaii. 2 Lewis, Richrd K. Sr., Hawley's Con- densed Chemical Dictionary, Fourteenth Edi- tion, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2002. CONCLUSIONS SEM/EDS ANALYSIS (Nick Reiter, The Avalon Foundation): (1) By all indications, the glassy stone samples provided are most likely highly-vitrified soil. The source of this vitrification/conversion to a glass remains unknown. (2) The lighter green areas of the stone (said to have fluoresced at the time of retrieval and for several months follow- ing) are comprised of essentially the same elements as the darker areas, but contain multiple tiny air bubbles and voids which account for the lighter color in these ar- eas; (3) The composition of the soils from the area where the glassy stones were found and the control soils 25m away is very similar, representing typical soil com- ponents. (4) The EDS scans of the glassy stones and the soils from the area where the stones were found do not resemble each other ratiometrically—indicating that the vitrified stones are probably not derived from soils indigenous to that precise lo- cation. INFRARED & MICROSCOPIC ANALYSIS (Phyllis Budinger, Frontier Analysis Ltd.): Infrared and microscopic examination of the stone shows an amorphous and glassy Si-O containing material. Clearly the data supports Nick Reiter's conclu- sions that this sample is soil that has been vitrified.

Burleson, Ph.D. MUFON New Mexico Director Anyone who has ever driven within sight of a transmitting tower late at night, watching the lights on the tower, knows that one's own motion can have a strik- ing effect on the appearance of the lights on the tower. On a stormy or foggy night, when a sus- pended, station- ary light seems to hang in the sky by itself, with only a solid field of darkness around it, a driver fol- lowing a winding road may see, for ex- ample, the tower light not only moving itself, but moving in such a way that it appears sometimes on the left side of the road ahead and sometimes on the right. And if one's own motion can have such an effect on the appearance of a sta- tionary light source, the effect that one's own motion can have on the appearance of an object that is itself genuinely in motion may be even more complex. The intent here is not to cover all pos- sible cases and scenarios, since in fact there are infinitely many possibilities. Rather, the intent is to look at a few rela- tively simple situations to see what the implications are when an observer de- scribing the motion or apparent motion of a UFO is in motion himself or herself. There is considerable mathematical computation behind the examples which follow, but I will omit most of the math- ematical detail in favor of presenting the general nature of the results. Also, I will simplify things by show- ing them only in two dimensions, the as- sumption being that an observed object remains at more or less the same altitude throughout; clearly, more complicated scenarios, where altitudes vary, would require images in three dimensions. Finally, I will generally assume that the observed object is a unitary light source for which the observer cannot see sur- face features, contrails, or other details <A .-sV L- that might tend to modify the perception of the object's movement. The simple fact is that when viewing an object in the sky, observers who are themselves in motion often tend to disre- gard the effects of their own motion, or at least tend to give inadequate consider- ation to those effects. I was recently reminded of this my- self-finding that an experienced observer and UFO investigator is not by any means immune-when I drove past a light source on a stormy evening. Out here in the prairie around Roswell, NM, many farmers and ranchers have those long \"pipe on wheels\"watering systems that roll across the fields, and these are sometimes equipped with a flashing blue light at night. When I drove up a road approaching one of these lights, the light itself seemed to move off in an accelerating arc across the sky, and the \"apparent motion\" effect was very realistic even though I had rea- son to know very well that the light was in fact stationary. (Even when the water- ing systems are being moved, they move very slowly.) The gut feeling was that the object moved, and I only thought about the ef- fects of my own motion in retrospect. This experience got me thinking about 1 what I suspect is a very common phe- ! nomenon among ob- • servers, particularly ; at night, and particu- larly on cloudy, foggy, or stormy nights: rather than making mental ad- . justments to take one's own reloca- tions into account, : one tends to think of an observed object's motion or apparent motion in terms of i the viewpoint from : which one first sees theobject, as ifcon- ,-, .//on ' tinuing to see the '•'••' object from that ; viewpoint. The effects upon one's perceptions can be quite varied and interesting. Let's look at a very simple scenario first, one that in simplified form reflects the experience I had that night with the flashing blue watering-system light. In this situation, the observed object is stationary, 100 feet out to one side (let's say the right or east side) of a straight road, and one follows this road northward 1,000 feet to a point opposite the object. Object appears to move When one disregards the perceptive effects of one's own motion, the result is simple: in the same time-interval, the ob- ject appears to follow a 1,000-foot linear path in the opposite direction (south- ward), parallel to the road, finally appar- ently passing the observer, as shown in Figure 1. (Here and elsewhere a point with a box around it will denote the observer's original sighting position, and a large dark dot will denote the object sighted, as positioned when first seen.) Not surprisingly in this case, the observer's linear motion lends a parallel- but-opposite apparent linear motion to the object. But there's more to it than that. When one first sees the object up ahead on the right, it appears to move at a much slower angular velocity than that which it ap- March 2004 MUFQN UFO Journal Page?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"pears to have later when \"passing\" the observer. In this case, if the observer is actually moving at 100 feet per second, or about 68 miles per hour, a little trigonometry will show that the object during the first sec- ond of observation appears to move through only about 0.61 degrees of arc, whereas by contrast, between the 9-sec- ond and 10-second mark, the object ap- pears to move through 45 degrees of arc. The effect in angular-arc terms is that the object may well appear to start off from a hovering position and accelerate along a linear path parallel to the road, approaching and speeding past the ob- server. In truth, remember, the object is stationary. This increasing angular rate of change in an object's observer-motion-induced apparent motion is common even in other more complicated scenarios when the object's proximity to the observer makes it seem to go through wider arcs per unit time than it seems to go through when further away. In the rectilinear case just described and in cases yet to be examined that in- volve more complicated motion of both the observer and the observed object, the mathematical technique for figuring out at least approximately what the observer sees the object seem to do involves some elementary vector analysis. A circular path In Figure 2, where again the object is stationary, the observer this time travels a circular path below the object as shown, and (we assume) largely disregards the effects of his or her own motion. In this case, the object, from the view- point of the observer's location when first sighting it, appears to be traveling in a \"reversed\"circular arc itself. Again, in terms of angular velocity, it will of course seem to move faster when closer to the observer than when further away. (The observer can't necessarily see that the object follows an apparent orbit that is circular, but what he or she does see is essentially what one would see, with whatever depth perception limi- tations might apply, if the object cfa/move in that orbit relative to a stationary ob- server.) In Figure 2, the arrows from observer to object reflect some of the repositioned sighting vectors. Both in motion Needless to say, if the object itself is actually in motion as well as the observer, the object's observer-motion-induced apparent motion gets trickier to predict. Let's consider a simple case in which the observer is moving along a linear path at PageS -•>*—>£ 2-- C-if-w/cxr _ -\\iir.ar f*ii»fifi constant velocity and the object, at a con- stant and comparable velocity, is moving along a linear path at right angles across the observer's path in such a way that the object will pass directly over the ob- server. As always, we will suppose that the observer thinks of the object as seen from the original observation point. If one repositions the sighting vectors as described, one finds that the object ap- pears to approach and pass the observer in a linear orbit; see Figure 3. This is scarcely surprising, but there is a counterintuitive element here. In a sense, the linearity of the object's appar- ent motion in Figure 3 is derived not so much from the object's actual motion as from the observer s actual motion. We can see this if we consider a simi- lar case (see Figure 4) in which again the object travels through a linear orbit cross- ing the observer's path, but this time the observer's path is a circular arc as shown. In this case, by repositioning the sight- ing vectors one will find that the appar- ent motion of the object itself is a broad circular arc, tending to reflect not actual MUFON UFO Journal object motion but actual observer motion. The outcome of such an analysis is difficult to predict. Different arcs For example, Figure 5 shows a scenario in which the observer travels in a circular arc and the object travels at comparable speed in a parallel-circular arc with the opposite orientation, yet the apparent motion of the object comes out roughly linear. Obviously if one looked at more and more complex cases of observer-versus- object motion, things get stranger and stranger, and the apparent motion of the object may often bear no common-sense resemblance-even though it has a math- ematical relationship-to the actual mo- tion. One has to reflect only a moment to realize that there are relative motion sce- narios in which an object may appear to hover when it isn't hovering, or may ap- pear to follow some exceedingly strange path generated mostly by the observer's own \"orbit,\" and in such a case the ob- ject could be flying a linear path, could be flying a complex path very different March 2004"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"^ -' C ! re u J&r/li (-'r..-» /r> c ' r <-. ii / < i N from the apparent one, or could even be stationary. Generalizations in this business are hard to come by, though there are some. For instance, observer-motion-in- duced apparent UFO motion is generally in some sense retrograde to actual ob- server motion. Even here, though, there are exceptions. For example, a northbound observer does not (by ignoring his or her own motion) make a truly northbound airborne object seem to move southward unless the observer is moving north faster than the object is, since otherwise, with a slower northbound observer and faster northbound object, the observer-induced effect is only to make the object seem to move (northward) at a slightly lower rate. This sort of thing is fairly obvious, but beyond such elementary principles the \"X irr-*/^/:•>•\"/a- question of relating actual to apparent motion is decidedly not an easy problem. If observer motion and UFO motion get very complicated, what the apparent- motion UFO orbit actually looks like can be varied almost beyond imagining. At any rate, even without more exten- sive analysis it's obvious that, all other things being equal, the most reliably ac- curate observer is the stationary observer. But since many UFO sightings do take place when observers themselves are in motion, clearly the UFO investigator must evaluate their description of the motion of the observed object with extreme care. I believe that even this lighter survey of the topic will suffice to show that there is often a considerable discrepancy be- tween what a percipient thinks he or she sees an object do, on the one hand, and what the object actually does on the other. Newfound object beyond Pluto may be slightly smaller By Robert Roy Britt Senior Science Writer A newfound hunk of ice and rock be- yond Neptune is larger than most, and might contend for the title of the biggest object in the solar system besides the sun, planets, and moons. The object is in a region of frozen, cometlike bodies called the Kuiper Belt. The discovery was announced in Febru- ary by the Minor Planet Center in Cam- bridge, Mass. Preliminary observations suggest that the icy rock, labeled 2004 DW, is 520 to 1,170 miles wide (840 to 1,880 kilometers). Physics dictates that objects this large be generally round, like mini-worlds. The largest known Kuiper Belt Object is called Quaoar (KWAH-o-ar) and was discovered in 2002. Quaoar is roughly 780 miles (1,250 kilometers) wide, about half as big as Pluto. It orbits the sun every 288 years, mostly beyond Pluto's orbit. The discovery was made by the Cali- fornia Institute of Technology's Mike Brown and colleagues Chad Trujillo and David Rabinowitz as pan of the same sur- vey that found Quaoar two years ago. \"The object is probably about 1,600 kilometers in diameter, larger than the 1,250-kilometer Quaoar,\" the researchers said recently in a Web posting. \"If subsequent measurements verify this size estimate, this would make 2004 DW the largest minor planet known, and larger than Pluto's moon Charon, which is about 1,300 kilometers in diameter. This still doesn't beat Pluto, which is about 2,300 kilometers in diameter.\" 2004 DW is nearly 47 times as far from the Sun as Earth is. Some astronomers say it's possible that an object larger than Pluto might still lurk there unfound.

As this research is completed, the results will be printed in the Journal. In fact, the April issue of the Journal will feature a very interesting article by re- searcher Deborah Lindemann regarding the hyponotic regression that she did with Romanek, including Romanek's drawing of a complex mathematical equation, as well as significant insights into one of his en- counters. First, however, an overview of his expe- riences up to this point. Romanek's current series of encounters with UFOs began on Dec. 27,2000, at about 11:30 AM. He had decided to drive into the mountains in Colorado, not far from where he was living in the Denver area, with the idea of shooting a video to show to his girlfriend, who lived in Nebraska. As he was driving near the Red Rocks Amphitheater, he noticed that traffic had slowed, and individuals were looking and pointing at an object above some nearby power lines. Instead of stopping, Romanek \"got a little scared\" and speeded up his van. However, the object caught up with his vehicle and was passing it. More fascinated now than frightened, he stopped his vehicle, and got out his video camera. The object \"straightened up and accelerated so fast that it made a popping noise,\" he explains, but it stopped about 1,000 feet away, and Romanek shot a somewhat shaky video-too shaky, it turns out, for proper analysis. A second episode The second episode occurred the latter part of August (probably Aug. 29), 2001, as Romanek, his girlfriend Lisa, and friend Mark were headed to Pennsylvania. As Mark was driving on Interstate 80, near the Indiana-Ohio state line, Lisa pointed to something in the sky, suggesting that it was a UFO. Mark could not see it, but Romanek saw it to the left of the vehicle. \"This thing looked big,\" he recalls. Mark slowed the vehicle, but the ob- ject moved into a cloud and vanished. Later, however, it reappeared to the right of the vehicle, then disappeared again. On the way back from Pennsylvania, probably on Sept. 1, in the afternoon, they again spotted what appeared to be the same object. It was closer this time, and could be seen clearly with their bin- oculars as a disc. Romanek attempted to videotape the object, but it went into a cloud each time the vehicle was stopped. They observed the object through Ohio, Indiana, and part of Illinois before stopping at a rest area. After this stop, they did not see the object again. Both Mark and Lisa have backed up Romanek's account. A third encounter Romanek's next encounter occurred on Sept. 20 in Colorado where he worked. Customers reported that there was \"something\" above his place of work, so he went outside and saw what he described as a big red sphere pulsat- ing about 500 feet above the building. The sphere slowly floated off to the northeast. Romanek closed up and headed for Red ball in Sept. 30, 2001, sight- ing. home, only to see that the object had re- turned. It followed him home, and he rushed into his house to get his video camera. He managed to tape the object, and reports that \"a bunch of us were outside watching this thing.\" The next morning he discovered wounds in his back, and hair and skin rubbed off his wrists. He notes that the wounds did not hurt, and they healed quickly. He recalled having had a bad dream that night about \"possum people,\" but could not immediately tie the dream to the wounds. That would come later. MUFON investigators discovered that under a 15-watt black light, Romanek's wrists glowed with a yellow-green fluo- rescence, and each wrist, both front and back, had a quarter-sized orange fluores- cent mark. Investigators attempted to scrub off the marks without success, but over time the fluoresing gradually went away. A fourth encounter On Sept. 22, 2001, after sunset, Romanek was enroute to an astronomy Romanek's hand, showing fluorescence Page 10 MUFON UFO Journal March 2004"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Sketch of Sept. 30, 2001, sighting. party at Daniel's Park, located about 25 miles south of Denver, when he noticed that outside his van was a blinking red light. He checked his turn signal, but it was not on. As he crested a hill near the park, he saw the blinking object, which turned left and flew right over the park, where it was observed by those present for the party. A fifth encounter On Sept. 30 he was driving through the Denver suburb of Lakewood, CO, heading home from work, when he saw a beam of light hit the ground next to his van, then sweep across the van. Romanek says, \"I thought it was a police helicop- ter, so I rolled down my window and waved at whatever it was beaming me.\" Then he noticed that traffic had stopped, and people were leaning out their windows. The source of the beam of light was an object above the van, blink- ing around two times a second or so, ac- cording to Romanek. \"In between blinks you could see the blue-green light com- ing out of the object on the bottom,\" he recalls. Stopping near the entrance of Old Stonehouse Park, he grabbed his video camera \"and got some real good shots of it\" before it moved into the park and hov- ered about 250 feet over a large tree. Several witnesses in the park also saw the ball-like object which glowed red, yel- low, and orange. The object began to rise until it was about 1,000 feet high, accord- ing to witnesses, several of whom also shot videos of it. The glowing object then shot rapidly upward to about 17,500 feet, which was the height of clouds at that time. It con- tinued to pulsate, then shot abruptly to the west and seemed to dis- appear. A few seconds later it reappeared at the edge of the clouds, stayed for awhile, then disappeared into the clouds with a large lightning-like flash, but no sound. It reappeared a few sec- onds later, moved slightly to the southeast, and once again moved into the clouds with a bright lightning-like flash-but again no sound. Romanek's video of this sighting was good enough for analysis by Jeff Sainio, MUFON photo analyst, who noted that \"the most strik- ing characteristic is a blink- ing, measured at 8.26 (within 0.02 %) blinks per second. Humans have an upper limit of 10 blinks per second for recognition. This behavior excludes normal aircraft lighting, strobe lights, or incandescent light filiments.\" Phenomena continue Stan and Lisa were married, and he moved to Nebraska, settling into a new home. He soon found that he was sleep- walking off and on, something he had never done before. He reports that one night Lisa woke up and saw him standing at a bedroom window. When asked what he was doing, he said, \"Shhh, they're coming.\" He says he walked to all three win- dows, repeating himself. When he got back into bed he said, \"They're here. I can feel it.\" Then he quickly fell asleep. On Aug. 30, 2002, at about 2 AM, Romanek and Lisa were awakened to dis- cover bright lights filling the room and flashing, even with their eyes closed. Romanek says Lisa, now apparently ac- climated to the phenomenon, said, \"Great. They're here for us. At least they are not afraid to park in the front yard.\" Romanek got up and looked out the bedroom window, observing what he de- scribed as \"strobe lightning that seemed to never stop and made no sound.\" He called for Lisa to look, but she told him to get his video camera, which he did. He videotaped the light show through the picture window, keeping his eyes on the sky. He says, \"If I would have at least looked down I would have noticed the object spinning on the road in front of our parked van. As it turned out I had to wait to replay the tape to notice it. \"At first I thought it must be a reflec- tion,\" he said, \"but after a good investi- gation we realized it was not. On closer inspection of the video, the damn thing comes up onto the grass closer to me, and then backs up when I sneezed.\" The spinning object was about a foot tall, and gave off a red light. Romanek was to see the spinning ob- ject again. On Sept. 7, 2002, in the evening, Lisa was sitting on the front steps watching their cats play. She called to Romanek to come and watch their cat Lacey, which was acting very odd, seem- ingly stalking something that was not there. The cat was in the area where the spin- ning object had been on the ground a week earlier. Romanek got his video cam- era to see if the night vision feature would pick up anything that he could not see, but had no results. However, he started filming, and an- other cat also started stalking at the same spot where the object had been sitting. Lisa decided to : go back inside. Not much later the cats suddenly jerked their heads and ran off. Romanek noticed something by the corner of the garage, about 25 feet away, and realized it was the same spinning red object that he had videotaped a week ear- lier. Again there was no sound. Continu- ing to videotape, he walked toward the object, but when he got to within 15 feet, his camera screen went white, then blank. At about this time a neighbor's mo- tion sensor went on and the object dis- appeared. It had left no traces in the grass. When the video was replayed, it was noticed that the video had indeed gone out, but the audio had still func- tioned. A different type of encounter On Nov. 18,2002, at 3 AM, Romanek reports he woke up outside in only his shorts, and was kneeling by a tree throw- ing up. In trying to get back into the house, he discovered that the doors were locked, so he went to the bedroom win- dow and woke up Lisa. She immediately noticed that once again there were open wounds on Romanek's back. He reports that he later discovered that he had also broken a rib. Strangely, Romanek was tightly holding dirt in his hand. That soil is now being scientifically analyzed. The next morning the Romaneks dis- covered a large circle burned in the grass by the garage. He reports that \"within a few weeks the grass was completely dead.\" As noted, there are several other ele- ments of this case which are being stud- ied.

Filer Director, MUFON Eastern Region Unless noted, these reports have not been verified by official investigations. Disc shape in North Carolina GREENSBORO - A couple was out on their deck watching how the jet stream was affecting the speed and direction of airplanes in the sky on Jan. 24, 2004, at 3:30 PM. They were watching one plane flying east and one plane flying west and re- marking how much the speed was af- fected. They saw an extremely bright disc-shaped object in the sky over the PTI airport at a high alti- tude. The only thing to compare it to was how Venus has ap- peared recently in the night sky. The wit- ness states, \"My girl- George Filer friend thought it must be a star, and I remarked that it could possibly be Ve- nus. As we watched, the object appeared to be getting closer. \"At the time there were at least six air- planes visible in the sky, and each one was leaving a vapor trail behind it. This object was leaving no trail, and ap- peared to be coming straight down verti- cally and not horizontally like the air- planes. \"The object suddenly seemed to shift direction and begin to move straight up into the sky. It was getting smaller, but was still incredibly bright. A small cloud passed in front of the object, but the ob- ject was still clearly visible through the cloud, when suddenly it just blinked out. \"When the cloud passed, nothing was there anymore, leaving us at a loss for what it could have been. The cloud was small, and there was no way it could have gone in any direction but straight up without us seeing where it went.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, www.- ufocenter.com Flashing lights in North Carolina FOUR OAKS - On Jan. 4,2003, at 7 PM, the observer saw a bright light be- hind his home, and at first thought it was the moon in the northern sky. He looked east and saw the real moon. He grabbed his binoculars and saw an extremely large gold-silver-colored saucer with a definite dome on the top. The observer states, \"Looking through the binoculars, I could see flash- ing lights at the top, bottom and on the left side.\" He ran and got a video camera and telephoned others to come out and see the object. \"I was able to get the object on video- tape,\" he reports. \"After a few minutes of watching the object, it began to move very slowly to the east, where it went be- hind some trees and out of sight.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Indiana policemen have sighting HUNTINGTON - Roger Sugden, who is a MUFON investigator, writes, \"I was the first to look into the Huntington UFO affair. I went to Huntington the very next day after the story in the Herald-Press. I had two MUFON investigators with me, Doug Egolf and Gene White. \"We talked with the editor of the pa- per to verify the facts of the story, then went to the police station and talked with one of the police officers who was an eye- witness. We found him to be very cred- ible and perplexed at what he had seen. \"The newspaper report stated, 'Officer Chip Olinger was warming up his car Dec. 26, 2003, when he reported seeing a circular object in the sky and radioed officers Greg Hedrick and Randy Hoover, who also saw it. All three say they watched as the object moved out of the northwest, drifted toward a church steeple, then shot straight north without a sound in an encounter that lasted less than a minute about 2:30 PM. The trio describes the object as about the size of a hot air balloon or a backyard trampo- line. They said it was low enough in the sky that Olinger thought it might crash into the steeple.' \"We were not able to talk with the other officers, or the other eyewitness-who is a pilot-who viewed the object from his car, and told the police officer that it was very low, below 1000 feet, and that even in good daylight, he could not identify what it was. \"He also said that it was larger than a Cessna aircraft.\"   ; Thanks to Roger Sugden, ASD/CFI MUFON IN, grog25@maplenet.net Australia sphere above boat HARDWICK BAY, YORK PENIN- SULA - The witnesses were fishing for sharks about 100-500 meters off the shore when they noticed a strange object hov- ering above their boat on Dec. 25, 2003, at 11 PM. It was a bright white/blue sphere, with strange magnetic effects, such as metal hooks floating in the air. After about 10- 20 seconds it seemed to just vanish in a flash of light. Light circles in circle in Norway KERI - The six witnesses, a married couple with four kids, were walking home when they saw a blue light circling around in the sky, about 100 meters above their heads. The object had one outer circle and two inner, circles, and it was slowly moving north. There was a sound similar to a fog sig- nal, given at short intervals. They could see no physical shape of the object, other than the rotating lights. As they entered their home the alarm sounded even though there should be a 25-second de- lay after opening the door. Some pictures were taken with a digi- tal camera, but the batteries soon lost power, as did new ones that were inserted. The object was almost stationary in the sky at the same height just outside their house. They found more batteries and man- aged to take one more photo before the batteries also lost power. Three saucer rims in Ohio BE AVERCREEK - The witnesses saw the vapor trail of an airplane that seemed to be heading straight down toward the earth on Dec. 26, 2003, at 3 PM. One of the witnesses reports, \"We stopped our vehicle, as it appeared that a crash was near. The 'plane' suddenly made a right angle turn and stopped. \"What we could see was the 'edge' of a 'saucer' that was diagonal in the sky with the top left side higher than the right lower side. It was easily seen in a clear sky about as- bright as a plane's vapor trail on a clear day. \"The object slowly changed its posi- tion, but never lost its brightness. Then we saw another object do the exact same apparent plunge to the earth.and make Page 12 MUFON UFO Journal March 2004"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUF®N John F.

Louisiana flying triangle DERIDDER- On Jan. 21,2004, at 7:50 PM, three witnesses spotted something weird, and their dog started barking. The witnesses noticed a flying triangle with red lights on the points and white lights in the middle in the western sky over Deridder. It was hovering, and Air Force planes were flying around it.

The witness states, \"I saw, about 100 yards away, a perfect sphere about 5 or 6 foot across, hovering 75 yards off the ground, and it was moving very slow. \"It appeared to be observing from a distance. I walked towards the sphere and it changed direction, and as I compen- sated, it changed direction again. Here is the important point. I don't think I was supposed to see the sphere because it was almost cloaked with the background. \"The closest I could come to describ- ing this was that it refracted the light al- most as if you were looking at a mirror ball in water. \"When it became obvious that I could see it in contrast to the sky by walking directly at it, the craft made several slow, evasive moves, and then dropped away and down towards the ground and a bush. \"Then I could not distinguish it, be- cause there was no contrast to the ground and bush. I was unable to discern it at this point and lost my view of it. This event lasted about five minutes.\" Thanks to Jeff Rense and Peter Davenport www.- ufocenter.com UK flying triangle LONDON - On Jan. 24,2004, at 2 PM, a married couple saw three red lights in a triangle shape flying over. The witness reports, \"As it got closer, it flew lower, and my wife and I both saw it, so we drove to see if there was anything there. When we got there, there was nothing to see.

I had always felt this was a basically factual book because Scully had met with the firsthand witness to at least two UFO crashes. The book discussed that three flying saucers were found on this conti- nent, and a fourth on the Sahara Desert. Alabama tree-top objects ROCK CREEK - Coming home from the store at 7:30 PM, on Jan. 10,2004, a family noticed two bright lights in the sky. The couple,.with their two daughters, got their binoculars and went out onto the back porch to see an object hovering over the treetops with four bright white lights. As they continued to watch, it moved slowly to treetop level. At this time the white lights appeared to turn off and a red and blue light flickered on and off as it descended downward toward the ground and out of sight as dogs in the distance begin to bark.

I live near the air- port, so assumed planes, but it caught my attention because they never fly five that close together. I grew up here, and have witnessed planes my entire life. \"Then I noticed that they were hover- ing, not moving. Therefore, I stopped my car on the street in front of my home and watched. Four were silver, one was bright white. They did not move, at all, and they were very close to one another. \"Then, I said, 'Ok, I'm home; you guys can leave now,' and the white one gave four quick flashes of light, and began to move between the other four, which were outlying in a rough circle pattern-though not quite a circle. They were beautiful, what I could see, and seemed powerful.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, UFOcenter. Pencil shape in California LA CRESCENTA - The witness was driving down Montrose Avenue when he saw a strange craft above him at 12:30 AM on Jan. 18, 2004. He states, \"The craft was very long, like a pencil, with steady green lights on each end, and a flashing red light in the middle, flying far too close to rooftops to be a plane. \"It didn't look like a plane anyway, so I started following it down Montrose Av- enue, but it was going about 55 mph, which was faster than I dared go on a Saturday night with all the police around. The craft turned and was going steadily up Pennsylvania Avenue, so I followed. \"The craft turned again at Foothill Boulevard, and there were many civilians watching it, and one car followed it along Foothill with a video camera. The craft moved quickly, and I heard no sound from it, even though it was close to rooftops. After following it for a while, I headed for home.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, UFOcenter.

But it was a cold night, and it was unlikely for a hot air balloon to fly in temperatures 5 degrees above zero. The shape of the object changed, and they were closing on the object faster than would be expected if it were a hot air bal- loon. The husband states, \"As it passed overhead, my wife was able to crane her neck and look up and see a disk-shaped object, metallic in color, and not entirely smooth. \"The object did not have lights.

'\"The extraterrestrials have yet to make contact with me,' said Much, who will help moderate the dinner seminar (closed except to forum participants) on 'The Conspiracy Behind Conspiracy Theories: Have Extraterrestrials Made Contact With Government Leaders?' \"The British moneymaker is confident 'at least for now' that De La Rue remains the largest non-government printer of bank notes in the Milky Way.

Box 3226,Chester, CH4 7ZB, UK. www.hiddenmysteries.com, Hidden Mysteries, 22241 Pinedale Lane, Frankston, TX 75763, 903-876-3256, $35.00. Reviewed by Dwight Connelly One of the first things you might no- tice about this book is the price, $35.00, which at first glance this might seem ex- cessive for a 168-page book, even a hard- back. However, there is a reason for this higher than average price. The wonder- ful reproductions of works of art in this book-many in full color-require high quality paper and printing. If you are fascinated by ancient art and artifacts- especially those which seem to show images of UFOs or entities-then the il- lustrations alone are well worth the price of this book. Whether the evidence of ancient UFOs and entities presented is compel- ling, as the subtitle suggests, is up to the reader. The subject matter is certainly hard to ignore: When one sees what ap- pear to be UFOs in a painting of Christ's crucifixion, one cannot help having a re- action. Many readers will have seen some of these illustrations elsewhere-possibly even in the Journal-but so far as I know, this collection put together by Hurley appears in no other book. (They do ap- pear on his website, www.ufoart- work.com). Hurley's first chapter discusses \"Ufology Today,\" and his presentation appears to be unbiased and generally accurate. He does get things a bit con- fused in describing Roswell, but handles abductions, animal mutilations, crop circles, the Catholic church involvement, NASA, and SETI well. His modern sources are not always the best, but he footnotes these sources in most instances, so no real damage is done, especially since this book is es- sentially about ancient sources, not modern ones. Chapter Two deals with \"The Art of Interpreting Historical Events,\" and this is well done. Illustrations are utilized to explain concepts, and Hurley does a good job of placing historical art in cultural and chronological perspective. In Chapter Three the author discusses \"Creation Stories,\" moving from Asia, through Africa, and on to North America, South America, and Australasia. He looks at the possible relationship between UFOs and entities in both the Old and New Testaments, as well as in the Koran, thus moving somewhat beyond creation stories. Chapter Four discusses the works of .\"Prehistoric Artists,\" including cave paint- ings, outdoor petroglyphs, intriguing figu- rines, and other objects which could be interpreted as depicting UFOs or ETs. A number of very interesting illustrations are included, several in color. Chapter Five deals with \"UFOs in Western Religious Art,\" a chapter which will probably be of special interest to read- ers, as it touches on a subject close to most individuals. Of the several pieces of art shown in this chapter, one of the most interesting is \"The Annunciation,\" painted by Carlo Crivelli in 1486. This painting, which was originally in the church of the Annunciata in Ascoli, Italy, was transferred to the National Gallery in London in 1846, where it still resides. • In the painting, a UFO-like object is shining a beam through a wall (and a dove), and onto the head of the Virgin Mary. There are several other paintings which feature \"UFOs\" and religious fig- ures. Chapter Six lists \"Historical UFO Ac- counts 498 BC to 1900 AD,\" sometimes briefly, sometimes in more detail. The sources are footnoted, which gives the reader the opportunity to judge their likely validity. Again, illustrations are utilized where possible. Chapter Seven, a fairly short chapter, discusses \"Out of Place Artifacts,\" such as the Nazca lines in Peru, the Mitchell Hedges crystal skull, mysterious maps, the pyramids of Egypt, various ancient objects that look like UFOs or entities, the \"Baghdad Battery,\" and the \"Greek computer.\" Chapter Eight, the final chapter, deals with \"UFOs Depicted in Early Photogra- phy.\" As one would expect when work- ing with photos-even old ones-those il- lustrated are open to much interpretation, and the degree to which they have been expertly scrutinized varies greatly. But whatever their demerits, they are certainly interesting. Overall, this is a very impressive book, and I marvel at the time it must have taken to gather the many illustrations and re- lated information. Every item illustrated is also described, sometimes fairly exten- sively, and there is an abundance of foot- notes. The four-page index-something too often missing in UFO books-is quite helpful, though a bit short. While Hurley seems convinced that these numerous historical pieces of art and texts show that UFOs and entities have been with us since the beginning of humankind, he does not unduly press the point. He is not dogmatic, leaves room for different interpretations, and even points out evidence which does not sup- port his conclusions. This is one of those books which ev- ery ufologist should have-and one that you will want to frequently share with others.

From a nuts and bolts scientific view- point, the discussion with BLT's Nancy Talbott stands out in this DVD as she dis- cusses the ground- breaking work of Will- iam Levengood involv- ing plant and soil changes, as well as some of the more recent investigations by BLT as it expands its base of scientists. Ms. Tal- bott's graphics are nicely interwoven into the discussion. Veteran researcher and author Colin Andrews is featured, and has much to say. He is accompanied by a very large cast of indi- viduals with varying viewpoints, most of whom are from the UK. Among the high- lights is the discussion by John Martineau of the numerous lines and shapes of crop circles (obviously what we call crop circles are not neces- sarily always circular, although circles usually play a significant role in their makeup). His graphics are fascinating. There are many perplexing circles in this documentary, but pilot and researcher Busty Taylor describes one that is extra special-the apparent formation of the 140- circle Julia Set in wheat within a period of about 25 minutes, as reported by a pilot who had flown over the area twice. Two other witnesses-a groundskeeper and a security guard-reportedly verified the time of the formation. This 1996 formation is compelling, as it features tremendous size (915 feet in length), daylight formation (between 5:30 PM and 6:15 PM, according to the wit- nesses), and, as noted, creation within a short period of time. Being across the road from Stonehenge added a nice touch. While there is no shortage of theories as to what creates the crop circles and what they represent, most participants in this presentation seem to conclude that, while they appear to be caused by some sort of ^energy-possibly microwaves or a currently unknown force—some sort of A Whittlesea, Victoria, Australia, city employee snapped the above photo of a rail- road crossing with a digital camera, not noticing the \"object\" that appeared in the upper right area of the picture.

Those familiar with current crop circle research do not need additional evidence that most are not the work of humans, but Crop Circles: Quest for Truth adds impressive weight to that position. Anyone who views this DVD and still believes that the numerous circles pre- sented were all done by hoaxers is just not looking at the phenomenon with an open mind. This CD is a great introduc- tion to the phenomenon, yet it should be as interesting to the experienced re- searcher as to the uninitiated. I watched this DVD on my computer, and the color, background music, pho- tography, and sound were excellent. I'm sure the program would be even more impressive on a larger screen. I have to' confess, however, that watching even this excellent production for two hours straight was a little too much, so a planned break might be in or- der if this is shown to a group.

Friedman The UFO Debate I had been approached about doing a debate about UFOs for the Campus Freethought Alliance at Middle Tennes- see State University in Murfreesboro, TN, many months ago. Of course I agreed to take on any sceptic-debunker . Dr. Joseph Nickell, a full time employee of the self-anointed Committee for the Scientific Investi- gation of Claims of the Paranormal, was originally mentioned as a good possibility. I was looking forward to con- fronting him be- cause of both a previous run-in with him on a ra- dio program and Friedman his strange expla- nation of the Flatwoods Monster case. He said that the monster was a 6' tall owl, and that the UFO which was ob- served to land on a flat area at a nearby hill was just a meteor. Considering that a number of people saw the object slowly circle around the town before landing- and there was no shock wave, no crater, and no meteorites found-that seemed unlikely to say the least. Joe had worked as a magician and had three degrees in English, none of which provides much scientific training. In December I was informed that my opponent would be James McGaha, and the date would be Jan. 28. The topic would be \"Are Flying Saucers Real?\" Nickell didn't want to participate, although no reason was given. My opponent I agreed, and then tried to find out a lot about Mr. McGaha—without too much luck. I could find no books or detailed articles about.UFOs by him, not even much background. I was able to determine that the Tuc- son-based 58-year-old active member of the Tucson Sceptics Society and consult- ant to CSICOP was a retired major in the Air Force, was a transport pilot, and also licensed to fly single engine aircraft. He spent a year at the University of Texas, Austin, (on a track scholarship) in the 1960s, was drafted, and, upon getting out of the military, went to Georgia Tech University where he received a BS in Gen- eral Management in 1973. He then went back into the military and eventually retired after, among other things, being a parachuting instructor (more than 3000 jumps!). He had high level security clearances, and even flew into Area 51. He has taught some astronomy courses at Pima Community College, and received an MS in Astronomy in 1992 from the U. of Arizona via a National Science Foundation summer program. He has his own observatory, and has discovered a number of Near Earth Objects, some as- teroids and comets, and even received a $ 10.000 research grant for upgrading his equipment. According to some newspaper ar- ticles, he maintains there is no evidence there have ever been any alien visitors to Earth. No website by him was found re- lating to UFOs. Debate preliminaries I arrived in Murfreesboro, about 30 miles from Nashville, on Jan. 27, appeared on an hour-long radio talk show at 8 AM on Jan. 28, and in a \"Science and Pseudoscience in Psychology\" class that afternoon. The first caller on the talk show claimed that UFOs were the work of the devil. The third caller said he was a Chris- tian, too, but he had seen one. The Nash- ville Tennessean newspaper carried an article that morning with answers from both of us to questions e-mailed by a re- porter. My segment was much more de- tailed than was his. Debate gets underway The debate itself had to start a little late because of the overflow crowd in the largest lecture hall on campus. It was very formal, with no direct crosstalk between us. The moderator was Dr. Eric Klumpe, an astronomer with an aerospace engi- neering background. We each spoke from a different podium and sat in the front row when someone else was speaking. I spoke for 20 minutes, covering sev- eral large scale scientific studies. James had a five-minute rebuttal, and then we reversed and did the same again with 10- minute talks and 5-minute rebuttals, fin- ishing with each of us summarizing for 5 minutes. This was followed by a 30-minute ses- sion of questions from the audience. He used Power Point. I used slides. I referred to many sources for my claims. He gave none. I showed real UFO daytime photographs, all taken before home computers came on the scene. He showed fake pictures he had created fairly recently, implying all pictures were fraudulent. False claims He, in my view, was guilty of a number of false claims. For example, I had men- tioned the Betty and Barney Hill abduc- tion case and the star map work by Marjorie Fish indicating that the base stars, Zeta 1 and Zeta 2 Reticuli, were the closest to each other pair of sun-like stars in our neighborhood, being only 39 light years from here, and only an eighth of a light year apart from each other-and a billion years older than the sun. He claimed that one was a binary star, and therefore very unlikely to have stable planetary orbits. I briefly pointed out that this was false, as it was based on a foot- note in an old article by Dr. David Bonneau, a French astronomer, referenc- ing an unpublished article by a colleague. I had checked with Dr. Bonneau after Allan Hendry published this same claim in a Fate Magazine article. Hendry hadn't checked with Bonneau. Bonneau wrote me that the claim was false, and was the result of an idiosyncrasy of the tech- nique of speckle interferometry used to try to determine duplicity in stars. Oddly enough, the difficulty was la- belled \"Mickey's ears.\" I had, of course, noted this in various publications, which McGaha, despite his astronomical inter- ests, apparently hadn't read. The typeface debate Another false claim by McGaha was that the typeface used for the Truman Forrestal Memorandum of Sept. 24,1947, authorizing Operation Majestic 12, was a 1963 type face. I dealt with this false claim in my \"Review of Kevin Handle's CASE MJ-12,\" which is on my website, www.v- j-enterprises.com/sfpage.html. The claim had been made unofficially by Peter Tytell, a well known typewriter expert, who made the remark off the cuff with no formal examination, I cited the formal investigation by Questioned Documents Examiner James Black, as noted in a report to Dr. Robert M. Wood, that the typeface was from 1940. McGaha spoke of people claiming March 2004 MUFON UFO Journal Page 17"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"10,000 G acceleration with, as might be expected, no source being cited. I, of course, have never made any such claim. He claimed that a starship slowing down in the solar system would have to use a retrorocket, and the resulting ex- haust would have been easily observed by astronomers. Again no basis was pro- vided. I was reminded of Dr. Campbell, who claimed in 1941 that a rocket returning from the moon would have to fire a retrorocket to slow down as it approached the earth,' rather than using the atmo- sphere as we do. That was one of the reasons his calculated launch weight for such a rocket was too high by a factor of 300,000,000. Delphos dispute I had shown slides of the Delphos, KS, physical trace case. McGaha claimed it was just a fairy ring, even though no fun- gus remnants were found in the soil. McGaha also claimed that photo- graphic sky surveys had never seen a UFO. I pointed out that someone who worked for one of the evaluation teams noted that 10-15% of the photos showed anomalous lights. These were ignored because they weren't meteors. Robertson Panel proclamation McGaha claimed that the CIA's Robertson Panel had shown that UFOs were no threat to National Security. I noted that penguins in the Antarctic were also no threat to security, but are real, and that the Panel was mostly fine scientists who knew nothing about UFOs. I pointed out that the panel met for only four days, and quickly rejected hun- dreds of manhours of work by the Na- tional Photographic Interpretation Cen- ter on some UFO motion picture footage by claiming that what was filmed must have been birds. A question of UNKNOWNS In response to an audience question about the nature of those sightings that the Air Force admitted were UN- KNOWNS, McGaha falsely claimed that, because Project Blue Book only had a small staff, they had to make quick evalu- ations and, when there just wasn't enough time or evidence, they would stamp a case UNKNOWN. This was completely false, as anybody looking at the definitions given in Project Blue Book Special Report 14, which I had cited, would have known. There was a separate category of INSUFFICIENT IN- FORMATION for those cases for which there was insufficient data to make an identification. I had also pointed out that the better the quality of a sighting, the MORE likely to be listed as an UNKNOWN, and that based on a chi squared statistical analy- sis of six different characteristics, the. probability that the UNKNOWNS were just missed KNOWNS was less than 1%. These facts clearly contradicted McGaha's claims. By now I had expected to have copies of the two-hour video that was made of the debate, but no such luck yet. I want to be able to quote exactly what McGaha said for a long paper to be written, prob- ably entitled something like \"Anatomy of a.UFQDebunker.\" Fifty copies of the two-hour video have been ordered and paid for by me, and I will make them available to anybody for $15.00 US ($20.00 Canadian), includ- ing shipping and handling.

Kentucky Section Dir. A 17-year old motorist traveling south of Manchester, IN, around 7:30 PM on Jan. 24 claims to have encountered an un- usual \"figure\" in the roadway. The story was first related by his uncle. I spoke with the primary witness by telephone on Jan. 26. The witness lives in Manchester, and is a senior at South Dearborn High School. He lives at home with his mother and father. His name will not be used in this report. While driving his black Chevrolet Cavalier, a 1999.two-door model, south- bound along North Hogan Road, near Manchester, a \"figure\" was spotted in the headlights of the automobile, crouched down near a puddle of water. After passing the frail-looking figure, the driver looked into his rear view mirror and again observed-illuminated by the tail lights of his car-what he described as a tall, abnormal figure that moved strangely with pointed joints that \"buck- led out.\" He estimated the figure stood around 6 feet, seven inches. \"It had protruding joints and moved very strangely,\" said the witness.who de- scribed the figure as dark gray or black and \"pencil thin.\" It stood up and took several steps toward the woods. The \"figure\" definitely walked on two legs, and was thought, somehow, to be a male, although no clothing was noted. No face or eyes could be seen, but the wit- ness had the impression that it was look- ing straight at him. It was immediately thought not to be a human being. The duration of the sighting was pos- sibly within the 3 to 4-second range. The driver continued on for a small distance and finally put on his brakes, coming to a stop at an estimated two-minute \"walk- ing distance\" from the sighting location. He looked back to further observe the entity. At that point, a second car came into view and approached from the op- posite direction, passed the witness, and then seemed to make an evasive maneu- ver about where he thought the figure would be. Then the car turned around at that spot and pulled behind the witness. He said it was an elderly couple in the car, both in their late 60s or early 70s, and both with gray hair. The driver, who wore glasses, said: \"Boy, did you see some- thing back there? I'll tell you right now, that was no person.\" The passenger in the silver two-door Cavalier, an elderly female, said: \"It was no human being. It was no man.\" The eld- erly couple were reportedly \"spooked,\" but offered to follow the first witness the remainder of the trip down North Hogan Road, clearly in the opposite direction of their intended destination.   • With the elderly couple following be- hind him, the 17-year old continued to a friend's house, where he called his mother, telling her of the encounter and advising her to lock her doors (his residence is less than three miles from the sighting loca- tion). He then called his uncle. The witness was said to become in- creasingly hysterical, and within an hour was describing the figure as \"an alien.\" When asked by his uncle if there could be any alternative explanation, the wit- ness said that there was a chance it could have been an \"improperly dressed eld- erly person, that could have been wan- dering naked and lost (temperatures in the 20s) in the area without a coat.\" But he still described the \"figure\" as a \"dark, shadowy figure\" and \"super anorexic\" The uncle, Jerry Schedel, was con- tacted within an hour of the sighting, trav- eled to the area with his wife some 90- minutes later, and did not see anything. The ground was also covered with around four inches of snow. Page 18 MUFON UFO Journal March 2004"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"April 2004 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Planet Parade. The 5 naked-eye plan- ets continue their simultaneous visibility at dusk for about the 1st week of April. Mercury is very low in the W, fading into the twilight and breaking up the parade at the end of this viewing period. Venus (magnitude -4.4) stands well up in the W at twilight, not setting in the NW until about 11:30 PM daylight time. A small telescope reveals the planet's current crescent phase. Venus can be seen very near the Pleia- des star cluster during the 1st few days of April when it also forms a triangle with Mars above and the star Aldebaran to the left. The lunar crescent pairs up with the brilliant planet on the 22nd. Mars (1.5), to the upper left of Venus in Taurus, is well positioned in the W and sets in the NW before midnight. The red- dish world is visible below the crescent Moon on April 23. Don't confuse Mars with the nearby reddish star Aldebaran. Jupiter (-2.4), in Leo, stands high in the S during the midevening hours and advances westward during the night. The giant can be seen below the gibbous Moon on the 29th. Saturn (0.1), in Gemini, lies halfway up the sky in the WSW at midevening. The ringed world is visible near the lunar crescent on April 24. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Jupiter sets in the WNW about 4:30 AM in mid-April. Saturn sets in the NW about 1 AM. Meteor Shower: The Lyrid meteors peak in moonless skies on the night of April 21-22. Best observation time is when the apparent radiant point of this shower is high over- head toward dawn. Though only about 15 meteors per hour appear at most, they are bright and fast, darting out of the con- stellation Lyra. Lesser numbers can be seen for a few nights on either side of the peak. Moon Phases: Full moon—April 5 Last quarter—April 11 New moon—April 19 First quarter—April 27 The Stars: Leo the Lion, a symbol of heavenly spring, crouches due S at 10 PM daylight time in mid-April. Look for the familiar sickle outlining the lion's head and mane. The lion's heart is marked by the bright star Regulus (in the sickle's handle). Since the Big Dipper is well placed high in the N, this is a good time to make use of this asterism's pointer system for locating other stars and constellations. Dubhe and Merak on the outer end of the dipper's bowl point down in a straight path almost directly to Polaris the North Star. Megrez and Phad on the other end of the bowl aim in the opposite direction to Regulus and Leo. The curve of the dipper's handle \"arcs to Arcturus,\" the bright orange star in kite-shaped Bootes the Herdsman. If the curving path is ex- tended beyond Arcturus, you can \"speed to Spica\" in Virgo the Maiden.

Object moving down Wisconsin highway baffles couple By Chet Newman Burnett County Sentinel GRANTSBURG, WI - \"It went right alongside the highway all the way from Highway 48 down to the Bible Camp. Then it crossed over the highway in front of us and lowered down toward the field and hovered there about 50 or a hundred feet above the ground.\" Ted Wistrpm is crystal clear about what he and Heather Berrard saw as they were traveling south on Highway 87 from Grantsburg at about 5 PM on Dec. 17. They vow the aircraft, no more than 20 feet wide or long, was moving down the west side of the road at about 30 miles an hour. The craft was not nearly large enough to carry people, says Wistrom, but he also says it was dark, so exact size was hard to tell.   . Checks with officials in law enforce- ment and the Department of Natural Re- sources uncovered nothing to explain what the couple saw. Wistrom says he knows they weren't the only ones to see it. He says the car in front of them slowed down, too, as did two others behind them. Wistrom said he had planned to turn east on Highway O, but continued south on 87 to continue watching the aircraft. It made no sound. He says it wasn't very high in the air. He could see what looked like propulsion units, sort of like tubes, protruding out of the bottom of the craft that were \"tilted toward the ground, like that's what was holding it up.\" There were four rectangular lights on what appeared to be the back of the craft, spanning the entire rear, with the lights immediately adjacent to each other. Each light was two or two and a half feet high. While the craft was moving, the lights were all orange. When it began to hover over a field near the Bible camp, he said the center left light turned blue, and the center right one turned white. The white light began to blink as it was hovering, he says, and then the craft disappeared. Wistrom says he can't give an overall description of the craft, since they only saw the underside and rear.

Balthaser Mention the 1947 Roswell Incident, and one thing that always comes to mind is the 509th Bomb Wing that was sta- tioned here in Roswell when the incident occurred. Their place in history was apparent in WWII, when they helped bring the war to an end by drop- ping the only atomic bombs ever used in wartime. Hopefully they will never be used again, but should that need arise, the 509th today stands ready to continue to defend our na- tion with the B-2 Stealth bomber, now located at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri. The 509th is an elite group-60 years of military history is a long time. I've of- ten wondered if that longevity is due to their involvement and secrecy in ending the Second World War and/or the Roswell Incident, as both were events that did- ahd could-have dramatic effects on the history of mankind. • Is the 509th perhaps getting paid back for keeping secrets all those years? Many of us are aware of the secrecy that was maintained with the development, testing, and use of the atomic bombs in the early and mid 1940s. On July 8,1947, Roswell Army Airfield base commander and head of the 509th Bomb Wing, Col. William Blanchard, gave then Lt.Walter Haul orders to distribute a press release stating, \"Roswell Army Air- field Captures Flying Saucer on Ranch in Roswell Region.\" •We are all aware of the secrecy and cover-up following that press release, which continues to the present day. When I met fellow researcher Jim Hickman (http://www.thehickmanreport.- com) for the first time last year, one of the things we discussed was the 509th. Jim provided me with a copy of a uni- form insignia patch (above, left) which he had recently located for the 509th. My immediate reaction when seeing it was, \"Here is the proof we've been looking for pertaining to the 509th involvement with the Roswell Incident.\" It appeared pretty obvious that the Page 20 509th was identified on the insignia with the numbers 509; the B-2 Stealth Bomber was shown; and to my surprise an alien head and hands were depicted. This was it! All I had to do was con- tact the Air Force and verify what was on the insignia. Much to my disappointment, after five months of corresponding with the Air Force, I discovered I did not have the proof I had hoped for. I contacted the 509th at Whiteman AFB in Missouri to submit a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Request on Sept. 5,2003.1 received permission to submit the FOIA from the FOIA/Base Records Manager a few days later, and I immedi- ately did so with several questions per- taining to the insignia. The next correspondence I received was not from Whiteman AFB, however, because my FOIA request had been trans- ferred to the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards AFB, CA. The FOIA Custo- dian at Edwards AFB would make a de- termination whether any records could be released or withheld from disclosure un- der the FOIA. A few days later I received a letter from a USAF colonel at Edwards AFB with the title of Staff Judge Advocate indicating, \"A search of all relevant agencies has found no records responsive to your re- quest.\" Again a few days later I was surprised when I received a large envelope from a PhD historian at the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards AFB containing not only answers to my questions about the insignia, but a copy of the United States Air Force \"History of the 509th Bomb Wing\" Fact Sheet, and an Air Force Ref- erence Series, \"Air Force Combat Wings, MUFON UFO Journal Lineage and Honors Histories 1947-1977\" pertaining to the 509th. As one who is interested in the 509th, 1 considered that information a bonus. Below are the questions I asked about the insignia patch in my FOIA request, and the responses I received from the his- 'torian at Edwards Air Force Base Flight Test Center. Q. Because the B-2 bomber and the numbers 509 are shown on the patch, I assume this is an official insignia patch used by the 509th at some point during the testing of the aircraft? A. This is not an official patch. The official emblem used by the 509th Bomb Wing (above, right) was approved in 1952, and is very different from the ex- ample given. No official emblem would display a unit number without also indi- cating its function-bombing, reconnais- sance, fighter, etc. Q. Wording \"Classified Flight Test\" is at the top of the insignia. During what time period would the flight tests have been done and at what location? A. No Air Force unit would ever des- ignate \"Classified Flight Test\" on its em- blem. Flight tests, classified or unclassi- fied, are conducted by the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards AFB, and no AFFTC patch ever carried such a leg- end. Q. Latin words \"Gustatus Similis Pullus\" are shown at the bottom of the insignia. Please translate to English? A. Guststus Similis Pullus is dog Latin for \"Tastes Like Chicken.\" This is sup- ported by the alien figure, which appar- ently is eating the B-2. (Note) You have to appreciate that answer coming from the United States Air Force. March 2004"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Q. What do the nine horizontal lines in the background represent? A.Unknown. Q. What is the interpretation of the symbols shown on the right and left?. (One on the left appears to be a fork.) A. The symbol on the left is indeed a three-pronged fork. This would support the eating motif. The symbol on the right is unclear. (Note) It appears to be another eating utensil, known to me as a knife. Q. What does the upside down \"Q\" represent within the diagram of the B-2 bomber? A. The \"Upside down q\" is a symbol used in aeronautical engineering to rep- resent pressure ratio. Such a ratio is di- mensionless. Q. An alien face with two-three fin- gered hands is obviously holding the bomber on the insignia. What signifi- cance would an alien have with the B-2 bomber and/or the 509th? A. The alien's three-fingered hands are holding the B-2 in order to facilitate the eating activity. Q. Who designed the insignia patch and when? A. It is unknown who designed the patch, or when. It would be a privately- made emblem to be used informally as a souvenir, a joke, or possibly a party favor of some kind. Such a patch would never actually be officially worn on a flight suit or uniform. So five months of research on my part put me back to \"square one,\" and I did not have the proof I had hoped for.. We still know of the unquestionable involve- ment the 509th had with the 1947 Roswell Incident, and in the future new avenues of research will come forward, and we'll go there too. With the help of Jim Hickman and my correspondence with the Air Force, we do know what the significance of the of- ficial emblem of the current 509th is, and in fairness to the 509th, I'll share that with you. The 509th Bomb Wing's emblem is rich in tradition. The shield is like a family coat of arms, and uses symbols to tell its story. Each symbol on the shield represents some part of the past, except the 1947 Roswell Incident the 509th was involved •in. The Air Force wings represent the branch of service, but the wings are not in the familiar outstretched position. When the ancient Greeks approached a stranger, they raised their arms with the palms outward to show they were carry- ing no weapons, \"a sign of peace.\" The 509th obtained special permission to dis- play the wings in this configuration to show that it, too, comes in peace. Next the words \"Defensor-Vindex,\" (translated: Defender-Avenger) means that its mission was, and still is, to pro- tect and retaliate for any infringement on that peace. The atomic cloud burst represents two things: the fact that the 509th dropped the only two atomic bombs ever in war- time, and that it still uses atomic power as a deterrent to war and defender of peace. Finally, the eldest son symbol shows that the wing is the oldest atomic-trained military unit in the world. Even though I didn't obtain what I had hoped for with this information, I am grateful to the 509th Bomb Wing for what they have done and are continuing to do for our nation in keeping the peace, so I can continue searching for the truth.

In his article about Tracie Austin-Pe- ters (\"New Paranormal Talk Show Host,\" MUFON UFO Journal December 2003), researcher Preston Dennett wrote that Tracie and her husband Jim Peters saw the triangular-shaped UFO hovering over Studio City, CA, on Nov. 13,2001. Tracie also stated that during the sighting she received a telepathic com- munication from the UFO, and that one of the beings on board said that there were three occupants aboard the craft and that they were from the Pleiades star sys- tem. When I read the article by Dennett, I suddenly recalled that the Pleiades star system is described in the Old Testament of the Bible: \"Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?\" (Job 38:31). Not only that, but the bands of Orion seem to refer to the triangular belt star system of Oripn in the sky. The triangular system appears to have the same design as the grid layout of the three major pyra- mids on the plain of Gizeh in Egypt or the Great Pyramid, Second Pyramid, and Third Pyramid. This discovery was made some years back by a noted Egyptologist and has been described in books on archaeology and ancient Egypt. -Kenneth Lloyd Larson Study finds UFO sightings in Canada at all-time high The 2003 Canadian UFO Survey was released in February by Ufology Re- search of Manitoba (UFOROM), an inde- pendent study group that analyses in- formation about unidentified flying ob- jects reported across Canada. Its findings include: • There were 673 UFO sightings re- ported in Canada in 2003, or nearly two each day. • There were about 39 per cent more UFO reports in 2003 than 2002. • The number of UFO reports per year in Canada has increased almost 350 per cent since 1998. • In 2003, record numbers of UFOs were reported in British Columbia (304), Alberta (76), Ontario (150) and Quebec (49). • In 2003, about 17 per cent of all UFO reports were unexplained. This percent- age of unknowns falls to about seven per cent when only high-quality cases are considered. • Most UFO sightings have two wit- nesses. • The typical UFO sighting lasted ap- proximately 10 minutes in 2003. UFOROM research director and study author Chris Rutkowski notes: \"The most important findings of this study include the fact that the number of UFO sightings in Canada has increased over the past 15 years, and 2003 saw an all-time record high number of sightings reported. People continue to report ob- serving unusual objects in the sky, and some of these objects do not have obvi- ous explanations.\" He also says that many witnesses are pilots, police, and other individuals with reasonably good observing capabilities and good judgement. Although most reported UFOs are sim- ply lights in the night sky, a significant number are objects with definite shapes observed within the witnesses' frame of reference. Rutkowski concludes: The continued reporting of UFOs by the public and the yearly increase in numbers of UFO re- ports suggests a need for further exami- nation of the phenomenon by social, medical and/or physical scientists.\" The study was produced with the co- operation of researchers and investiga- tors across Canada and with case data from private, public and government sources.

Phillips Center for Physical Trace Research archaeoanom@inter-linc.net Introduction This report presents a statistical analy- sis of data given in 3,059 cases in- volving observa- tions of anoma- lous phenomena or objects on or near the ground resulting in physical residues generated by the observed phe- nomena or ob- Ted phm jects.  y These observations took place in 91 countries between 1490 and 2004. The analysis permits certain regulari- ties of these phenomena to be brought out. The data indicates there is a certain type of phenomenon which shows stable statistical properties. This research began in 1968, and after 36 years it is yet premature to consider the nature of these phenomena on the basis of the data presented to date. The developments of methods of obtaining more reliable data and expansion of the initial information used will result in a da- tabase of the most important piece of the UFO puzzle-physical evidence. At this point there seems to be no re- lation to the more popular crop circles, which are much larger and more complex than UFO landing sites. The current prob- lem is the inclination on the part of some investigators to identify possible land- ing sites as crop circles-if it's circular, it must be a crop circle. Suggested future research To obtain more definite conclusions, more reliable and detailed data must be obtained. These events must be well documented and sampled for laboratory analysis. There needs to be a central re- pository for landing/physical evidence events. Currently, the data is scattered among numerous investigators in many countries. A central repository should produce interim reports to be available to the gen- Page 22 eral public and serious investigators. This will produce new data and a much more complete database. The entire database should be available in some form, as physical trace events will give us the most substantial evidence for-or against-the existence of Unidentified Flying Objects.

All of the speakers at this 35 th annual symposium have documented this evi- dence, and will share it with the sympo- sium attendees. It will be one of those events you won't want to miss. Grant Cam- eron of Winnipeg, Manitoba. Can- ada, has collected evidence that U.S. presidents hold the key to UFO technological evi- dence. Grant has researched the presidential in- volvement in detail and will present the results of his investigation. Peter Davenport of the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle, WA, receives more UFO reports per month than any other source. He shares this information with MUFON and the public as a whole. He will show how this fits into the world- wide body of evidence. Budd Hopkins of The Intruder's Foun- dation in New York is one of the world's leading abduction researchers. His pre- sentation will focus on medical evidence in abduction cases, including a spectacu- lar new case that will be discussed for the first time this summer. Budd and his wife Carol Rainey just released their new book entitled Sight Unseen. Leslie Kean, Director of Investigations for the Coalition for Freedom of Informa- tion, will present evidence that phenom- ena for which there is no scientific expla- Estate Planning Some members and friends of MUFON have already included MUFON in their estate plans.

' •• nation have been observed in America's (and the world's) air space for over fifty years. Trained observers - pilots, air traf- fic controllers, radar operators, astro- nauts, military personnel, scientists - and government agencies have reported and documented spectacular events visually, photographically, and on radar. Deborah Lindemann, MUFON con- sultant from Fort Collins, CO, is a trained therapist who has done much of the in- vestigative work, along with Dr. Jack Kasher and George Zeiler on the Stan Romanek incidents in Colorado and Ne- braska. She will present the strong data- base of evidence in this continuing saga. British investigator Nick Redfern, now residing in Dallas, TX, will bring an ex- tensive set of case files from his past work and show how that information ties in with the events in the United States and elsewhere. David Sereda, of Marina Del Rey, CA, will present the results of his deep scien- tific investigation into the scientific com- munity at NASA and outside of the agency with respect to the 1990s shuttle mission video footage of UFOs. His interest in the subject began in 1968 when he and numerous other wit- nesses saw a large, classic disc-shaped UFO hovering in a clear blue sky in Ber- keley, CA. Ryan Wood of Broomfield, CO, hosts the Majestic Document Database and continues to reveal documented evidence of UFO activity that is real beyond a shadow of a doubt. His new revelations are evidence of the smoking gun we have all been looking for. George Zeiler of Aurora, CO, has been researching the trail of government documents that clearly shows that the U.S. Government's interest in UFOs did not stop with the closure of Project Blue Book in 1968, as we have been led to be- lieve. His evidence shows that the interest has remained strong throughout the years even though the official line is that no one is still looking at UFO evidence. His papers show how nearly every major gov- ernment agency has been involved right up to the present. Due to space limitations, I will con- tinue to define the list of speakers and workshops in the April issue of the MUFON UFO Journal, so I am sure you will not be disappointed with this year's event.
