FROM THE EDITOR We're a wee bit late this month because of circumstances beyond our control, but hope you'll bear with us. As promised, we've got a reivew of the Churchill-UFO papers recently released by the British Government and another Cash-Landrum article by John Schuessler lamenting the lack of potential radar corroboration of that particular case. A Bentwaters update by Mildred Biesele has had to be pushed back to the next issue. This time around you'll find her review of Carl Sagan's first novel, along with another review of a French book by Dr. Willy Smith of UNICAT. The usual departments are here,, too. Next issue we'll have more coverage of the Brazilian UFO reports, and deadlines permitting, story and pictures of the East Lansing Symposium, which drew mention by at least one of the national TV networks. By all accounts it was a weekend not to be missed. If you were unable to attend, however, a copy of the appropriate Journal and the annual Proceedings should bring you up to date.

One such book is La Grande Peur Martienne. When it first appeared, it was not well received by European ufologists, who perceived it as a demolishing attack on Ufology intended to promote the so-called socio-psychological explanations of the phenomenon. Perhaps in the end that is what the work of Barthel and Brucker has done; but after a thoughtful reading, I do not believe that such .was their original intent. The book addresses exclusively the French wave of 1954, more precisely, the cases reported between August 1 and November 30, of which the authors claim to have reinvestigated 562, by directly interviewing the original witnesses and reviewing the newspapers of the time. In doing so, they discovered a large number of cases with trivial explanations, as well as a good number of hoaxes and frauds, including deliberate media manipulations. The original reports are presented in the text together with the new elements discovered by the authors, thus eliminating those cases from the catalogs of UFO events. A|l of this sounds .serious and legitimate, and in a way is similar to the methodology used by UNICAT, but the reader soon, discovers that the selection of the cases presented is far from unbiased. The brunt of their attack seems to be directed at Jacques Vallee, and emphasizes the lack of care and critical judgment apparent in the selection of the cases that were included in his catalog. By actual count, more than 40 cases of the Vallee catalog have been shown to be poor, erroneous, and I will add, without scientific value. Not that Vallee does not deserve this ruthless critique. In fact, during our own consideration of Magonia we have found many cases that surprised us, as they are worthless and based either on newspaper accounts, marked \"personal\" (which rules out the possibility of an independent verification), or attributed to Guy Quincy, whose original listings do not have suitable references. Not unexpectedly, many of the cases demolished by Barthel and Brucker coincide with the ones I had already eliminated. EXPLANATIONS But after all this good work, the authors seem to run out of steam, and rush to their world-shaking conclusion: UFOs do not exist (sounds familiar, doesn't it?). Nobody has touched one, no craft has ever landed, no marks on the ground can- be attributed to those nonexisting UFOs. As Michel Monnerie said, \"there are no UFOs\". All we have is a complex mixture of various circumstances, magnified by the media eager for sensationalism and by ufologists wanting only to perpetuate a myth. There is really nothing behind those hundreds or thousands of reports, and all have a trivial and mundane explanation. Perhaps Barthel and Brucker realized at this point that they had gone too far, that the extrapolation from a few cases from the 1954 wave to all the cases in France, and by extension to all the cases in the world, was unsound. Thus as an afterthought, they tell us that they have \"also studied the majority of the important cases\" (for France), and they produce a short list of such cases. . But alas! Those are hardly the most important cases, which are notoriously absent. Not a word is said, for instance, about Cussac (670829) or the case of Dr. X (681102). Two other cases are noted: Quarouble (540911), dismissed by waving hands and ignoring the evidence; and Valensole (650701), for which, since other cases have shown that physical traces and humanoids are without foundation, the sincerity of the witness is dubious, and one must look for a psychological .explanation. To give the authors credit where credit is due, their criticism of the methodology in the selection of cases is accurate, and there is at least one classical case (Premanon, 540927) that they have unmasked. And they have also pointed out in the Vallee Catalog some of the cases without. scientific value, information which is really not new to us. In spite of their unsupported extrapolation, their leaning toward socio-psychological solutions, and their ignoring the evidence when it is not in the direction of their bias, the work has merits. It points out the fallacies of using newspapers as sources of information and the resultant inexactitudes in date and time, of which we have become so acutely .aware in working with UNICAT, and indirectly supports our methodology of not even considering a case unless there exists a good written report based on an \"in situ\" investigation.

Most rational people agree, I.think, that the widely-celebrated George Adamski saw about as many UFOs as a self-proclaimed bandit named Al Jennings.robbed banks. For the record, in ' spite: of his long-winded and .completely fictional \"autobiography,\" Al Jennings never robbed a single bank. Adamski and his flying saucer ^- and I think we can safely call it a 'flying saucer,' for it certainly cannot quaHfy as an Unidentified Flying Object —remind' me of the old joke about the Russian who is asked by the Commissar of Agriculture about the size of the potato crop. • . . \"Comrade Commissar,\" says the Russian, \"The potato crop is so large that if the potatoes were all put. in a single pile they would reach to the very feet of God!\"' . ' . . \"Comrade Marx has rightly told us,\" says the Commissar, \"that religion is the opiate of the people. There is no God!\"' ; •'• ' ' . .-: ; '\"There aren't any potatoes, either,\" says the Russian. Likewise, George Adamski never photographed an unidentified flying object. He photographed a fairly common, well-known object in unfamiliar circumstances and a lot of people, many of. whem should have recognized .the thing for what it was, were fooled. •.--.•• I don't recall when I first saw Adamski's photographs, but when I did a vague sense of familiarity stirred. I'd seen one of those things before — but where?. It took a long time for my memory to jell. Now — let's go back in time, and I warn you, unless you lived in a small town or a poorer section of a large one in your youth, unless you did a number of things your mamma would not have approved of, and unless you were born before World War II, it is likely that you won't recognize what, you see. The time is the early 1950's, the place, a hot-reputablfe establishment called .Sam's BBQ Hot Sausage Tap , Beer. That's apparently the name of it, because all of that is painted on a single l\" ; x 12\" plank about eight feet long that is nailed to the eaves of the long, low building. Sam's is.not airconditioned. A half dozen ceiling ifaris — very similar, to those just now coming back into fashion, but larger, sturdier, and with .just two blades-together — hang from the low ceiling. . . ' Along the back wall of the place there is a bar covered with linoleum, and back of it there are numerous signs, some lit, some not, advertising brands of beer. You see one for Grand Prize, one for Southern Select, one for Jax, perhaps one for Regal, and certainly the ubiquitous — in Texas, at least — Lone Star, Pearl, and Budweiser. There is also a sign : reading TAP ,BEER 25<F BOTTLE BEER 50<F PREMIUM BEER 35C NO CREDIT WE DO NOT SERVE MINORS WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE SERVICE TO ANYONE. To-your right, along the wall, you notice a series of pinball machines, probably a mechanical-bear target game, and certainly a slicktopped table for playing tenpin bowling with a metal object very much like a hockey puck. On this last there is a sign saying DON'T PUT DRINKS ON BOWL GAME THIS MEANS YOU! To your left, along the opposite wall, there are three or four billiard tables — three regular pool, one more likely for bumper pool.Got the-picture? Now-close your eyes and picture the light fixtures hanging above these tables. No, not fluorescents — this is before the invasion of fluorescent lights. These are round, dark green fixtures of metal, vaguely resembling a fedora with the brim turned down all around, with vents in the top — around the crown of the hat — that give off brilliant streams of white light and make spots all around the room. Inside each fixture there are four bulbs. — they can take 100 watt 'bulbs, but ;the ones in Sam's fixtures are more like to be 60 watt or even 40 watt. The .inside of the fixtures is enameled a brilliant white, somewhat yellowed now by . years of smoke deposit from Lucky 'Strikes and Roi- Tan cigars, and the 160 to 400 watts in each fixture sheds a, brilliant, almost shadowless light: straight down on the green, felt and clicking balls of the pool tables — i but only there, for the design of the reflective underside is almost directional,.- and the hot white light makes circles over the pool tables that don't seem to penetrate the murky interior of the rest of Sam's. From the 1920's until well after World War II, . especially in smaller towns and the places owned by people who weren't doing all that well, these light fixtures were widespread. They hung over bookkeeper's stands, over workdesks, over pooltables — anywhere bright, almost shadowless light was needed. The fixture itself was sheet metal, probably steel. The top was domed, about 12\" in diameter, and in the center a green, twisted electrical cord penetrated the metal. Below the dome was a vertical section about 3 l / 2 \" to 4\" high, pierced by numerous holes perhaps 2\" in diameter. From the bottom of the skirt — which served as a ventilator for the heat generated by the four incandescent bulbs inside — hung a wide, semiconical reflector that was rimmed by a turned edge. The fixture was coated with' baked-on enamel — dark green on the outside, white inside. These light fixtures received a mortal • blow with the coming of inexpensive fluorescent lights after World War II, and were probably dealt a final stroke by the energy crisis of the (continued on page 12)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"GO"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"THE CHURCHILL PAPERS By Philip Mantle & M.I. Birdsall Philip Mantle is the overseas liaison officer for the Yorkshire UFO Society (YUFOS), England. M.I. Birdsall is the Society's director of research. INTRODUCTION Under the British Freedom of Information Act, all official documents relating to H.M. Government are released by the Public Records Office (PRO) at Richmond, in Surrey, after thirty years The official \"holding\" of UFO documents by the Ministry of Defence began in 1962, and all previously held reports (i.e., dated before 1962) were purportedly destroyed. However, the Public Records Office does have a number of pre-1962 reports pertaining to the subject. It was widely believed by many top British UFO researchers that H. M. Government did carry out a comprehensive study of the phenomenon probably arourid 1955. Certain early press releases during the 50's carried a number of quotes concerning this. Yet our Ministry of Defence has always denied the existence of such a paper (see Document Number 1 .and 1A). Document Number 1 is here reproduced in its entirety. Number lA, dated 3 August, 1962, is from then Under Secretary of State at the Air . Ministry, Julian Ridsdale, to Mr. (now Sir) Patrick Wall MP, and reads as follows: \"Thank you for your letter of 20th July about flying saucers. \"You will, of course, remember the question you asked on 4th May, 1955, about publishing the results of an Air Ministry inquiry into the existence of flying saucers. George Ward, in his reply, said that there had, in fact, been no formal inquiry. The full text of his reply was: —. \"'Reports of'flying saucers', as well as any other abnormal objects in the sky, are investigated as they come in, but there has been no formal inquiry:- About 90 per cent of the reports have been found to relate to meteors, balloons, flares, and many other objects. The fact that the other 10 per cent are unexplained need be attributed to nothing more sinister than lack of data.' \"Naturally we are interested in reports of unidentified flying objects because of our defence responsibilities and we investigate these reports. whenever there is sufficient information to do so. It is still true to say that the great majority fall into the categories mentioned in the reply to your question. The remainder are unexplained because there is insufficient information for a complete investigation. \"We certainly do not have any evidence of the existence of flying saucers which we are withholding from the. public/' (Julian Ridsdale) PAPER RELEASE Rumors started to circulate in early January, 1986, that certain documents were to be released after the required 30 year waiting period, and that some of these concerned flying saucers. At that time, UFO groups in the U.K. did not comprehend their full potential. ' . By late January, the British television, radio and newspaper media began to relate information concerning the late Winston Churchill and his previously unknown interest in the UFO phenomenon (See sample newsclip from the. \"Sheffield Star,\" dated 23 January 1986). In early February we made a formal request to the Public Records Office for all papers concerning Winston Churchill and UFOs. At the third attempt we were successful and YUFOS withheld the printing of our journal, Quest, so we could include the just-released documents. In this way UFO researchers would be able to assess -the content and perhaps question the real meaning of the papers as soon as possible. We have prepared this report especially for the MUFON Journal, so that its readers, too, can share in our discovery. CHURCHILL INQUIRES Document Number 3 was titled \"Prime Minister's Personal Minute\" and was dated 28 July 1952. It is a short note from then PM Churchill to his Secretary of State for Air, Lord Cherwell, and read: \"What does all this stuff about flying saucers amount .to? What can it mean? What is the truth? Let me have a report at your convenience.\" (W.S.C.) Up until the release of this document, no person involved with British civilian UFO research had any idea that Churchill was interested in the subject. He was obviously concerned over the increasing number of UFO overflights over not only America, but the U.K. as well. Apparently Churchill was personally fascinated by the subject, but he may also have thought there were implications from a defence viewpoint. At any rate, there is a great deal of evidence to suggest he was not told the whole truth. AIR MINISTRY REPLIES Document Number 4 originated from within the Air Ministry and was forwarded by Lord Cherwell to Churchill. It contains a number of interesting points, but the conclusions reached by British UFO researchers are that little has changed over the last 30 years or so. The current Ministry of Defence still uses many of the same (continued on page 9)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Document Ho 1. .from: A Mathewson Defence Secretariat 8 Room 7260 MINISTRY OF DEFENCE Main Building Whitehall London SW1A2HB Telephone 01-218 (Direct Dialling) 01-2189000 (Switchboard) M I Birdsall Esq 67 Lovell Park Towers Leeds LS7 1DR Your reference Out reference l£?DS 8/10/209 Date November 1981 In your letter of 30 October you asked about a number of studies into 'UFOs 1 , which you thought had been carried out under Lieutenant General Massey, AM Sir Victor Goddard and AM Lord Dowding. I am afraid that I have .been, unable to find any record of these studies. As you may be aware it was only in 1967 that the MOD decided to retain its files on this subject; before that they had all been destroyed after 5 years, so our records only go back to 1962. There is, however, no evidence in what does remain that these studies were ever undertaken. A letter from the then Under Secretay of State at the Air Ministry, Julian Ridsdale, to Mr (now ; Sir) Patrick Wall MP in 1962 in fact clearly states that no formal enquiry was ever undertaken. I attach a copy of that letter. If, though, you have any more information about these studies, we will be happy to look again. Finally, we are not prepared to release to be public or UFO groups the reports of flying objects which the observer could not identify which are sent to us They have no security classification, but they are official documents and as such will be treated in accordance with the relevant Public Records legislation. They also contain personal information, such as names and addresses*which we regard as 'in confidence'. Our policy remains that we are prepared to make available, in response to serious enquiries, the details of specific reports if the information requested is readily to hand and easily identifiable.

Duncan Sandys, U.P. Document Number 6 ' ' Anthony Montague Browne, Eeq., D. P.O., CHURCHILL, CONTINUED mundane claims which are first evident here. Basically, it's a nonsensical paper full of cleverly worded jargon to diffuse the Prime Minister's • alarm at the increasing' public, interest in, and perhaps fear of, the UFO. Perhaps the conclusions reached were mundane because the mentioned . Air Intelligence study used a random sample of reports? Whatever, the use of the phrase, \"based upon William of Occam's Razor,\" seems decidely peculiar in this context. ••  . , It is interesting to note that the Americans are also mentioned. The Air Minister's reply mentions a similar investigation carried out by U.S. Air Force officials. There is little doubt he is referring to the conclusions reached by Project Grudge which, of course, negated the possibility of a real UFO phenomenon. Document Number 5 was sent by Lord Cherwell to Churchill. Dated 14 August 1952, it was a simple confirmation of the findings of the Air Force Intelligence study of UFOs. \"I have seen the Secretary of State's minute to you on flying saucers,\" Cherwell wrote, \"and agree entirely .with his conclusions.\"    • After the exchange • between Churchill and Cherwell, other members of Parliament showed more than^a casual interest in the subject of UFOs. For the first time we now have a definite confirmation of a secret Air Force Intelligence study into UFOs by the Royal Air Force. • . Document Number 6, classified \"Restricted,\" dated 14 March, 1955, was sent by the then Minister . of Housing and Local Government, •Anthony Montague Browne, D.F.C., to the Right Honourable Duncan Sandys, MP., or Member of Parliament. Browne wrote, \"I remember your talking about flying saucers when we were at Chequers .some time ago. I 'enclose an article from the \"Air Ministry Secret Intelligence Summary\" which may be of interest to you though I doubt whether: there is anything in it which you do not know already.\" Quite clearly the AI study was real, then. Moreover, Browne referred to it by handwriting in the margin as \"Volume 10 No. 3.\" Requests for this summary have drawn a blank. We were originally informed by the Public Records Office that it could not be Document Number 7 •• located. However, a colleague, the independent U.K. researcher .Timothy Good, made a personal visit to the Office to try to locate the secret summary. He was informed it had not been released by the office as it was part of a greater number of documents of which the release date was unknown. Further inquiries are still underway in hopes of securing a copy of this study. Judging from the contents of Document Number 7, dated 22 March, 1955, MP Duncan Sandys' reply to Browne, the original must have been available through sources at Whitehall, though thus far we civilians have been unable to trace it. CONCLUSIONS Our Ministry of Defence has always stated that no formal inquiry of UFOs was ever conducted. The newly released Churchill and other documents clearly brand this as an official lie. The reasons behind the continuous concealment of such documentation are still not clear. YUFOS, however, has long been at the forefront of :.• British .

BACKGROUND Betty Cash, Vickie Landrum and Colby Landrum encountered a large diamond-shaped object —*a mass of brightness — along Highway FM 1485 near Huffman, Texas on December 29, 1980. For simplicity, the object has been classified an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO), because no one has identified its source of origin, owners, or purpose. The UFO was seen by several witnesses to the east of the Cash- Landrum encounter location, moving in a generally westerly direction. Mrs. Cash was driving the automobile along the north-south stretch of FM 1485 when the trio spotted the bright light above the pine trees to the east of the highway. After a few minutes the UFO positioned itself directly above the road just ahead of the car, as if trying to hide below the treeline. . A few minutes later some helicopters stayed with the UFO as it flew away to the west side of the road, curving in a southerly direction. When the trio proceeded on down the road, they were forced to make several turns, eventually placing them along the flightpath of the UFQ and helicopters once more. They stopped the car again and watched as more helicopters entered the area. CORROBQRATION Helicopters were spotted just to the north of the encounter location by a man and his son outside their house trying out a Christmas toy. Others were spotted by a hunter near the second location reported by Cash and Landrum. A policeman and his wife also reported helicopters in the same location. Helicopters were also reported to the south of the encounter 10 location by a woman and her daughter near Crosby. A petrochemical businessman verified the Crosby sightings, as well. Figure 1 defines .the locations cited above. With all this aerial activity, why were there no radar reports of the incident? THE INVESTIGATION The UFO and the helicopters may have been spotted and tracked by radar. The problem comes in proving that assertion. It was approximately two months after the incident before the investigators made the first requests for radar data. An Air Traffic Control spokesman told the investigators that all radar tapes are pulled and destroyed after 30 days... Therefore, .the tapes were no longer available for analysis. The spokesman also said he did not recollect anyone mentioning the high level of activity on December 29, 1980. It is likely, however, that the tapes would have shown nothing, because the radar is blind below 2,200 feet altitude in' the area .of. the . Cash- Landrum encounter. The UFO and the helicopters operated well below that altitude throughout the incident. Low altitude helicopter operations are common around Houston. For example, the 136th Transportation Unit operating CH-47 helicopters out of Ellington Field flies across the Houston area on a regular basis for operations at the Addicks Reservoir without going through Houston Air Traffic Control or being spotted by radar. Requests to official agencies for information were futile. No agency or organization accepted responsibility for the helicopters or the UFO; therefore, they refused to dig deeper for data that could be helpful. Official radar records are not available for general scrutiny in any case. Therefore, the investigation was inconclusive in proving whether or not radar records exist, or if they show evidence of the Cash-Landrum . encounter. SPECULATION Investigation into the activities of airborne drug smugglers along the Gulf coast and United States/Mexican border provides some clues that may be useful in analyzing the Cash- Landrum case. In the early 1980 timeframe the United States Air Defense Network was focused on the areas to the North of the United States. The only worry to the south was for high altitude devices. Ground radar of the North American Air Defense System (NORAD) cannot detect low-flying vehicles of any kind on the southern approaches; not drug planes, helicopters, or Unidentified Flying Objects. Texas has no fixed-radar coverage in the 500 miles between Laredo and El Paso, or at key points along the western Gulf Coast. There are extensive gaps in low-altitude radar coverage along the border, ranging from 2,500 feet to 5,000 feet; and for several hundred miles this gap extends upward to 14,500 feet. Pointing to the holes in the radar coverage, Tom Bailey, chief of the U.S. Customs Service's air support branch in San Antonio said: \"We frankly don't know how many illegal flights there are across the border. I've heard estimates of 10 flights daily and I've heard 150.\" Texas Governor Mark White said: \"I can't help wonder why our military is so worried about stopping a future invasion of Russian bombers along our northern border when it is doing nothing to stop DC-3s loaded with drugs from entering this country from Mexico.\" Jim Adams, director of the Texas Department of Public Safety told (continued on page 12) i i3"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"FIGURE 1 FIGURE 3 NOTES: 1 INITIAL CASH-LANDRUM ENCOUNTER 2 SECOND CASH-LANDRUM LOCATION THIRD CASH-LANDRUM LOCATION FATHER/SON LOCATION POLICEMAN/WIFE LOCATION HUNTER LOCATION MOTHER/DAUGHTER LOCATION PETRO-CHEM MAN LOCATION 9,10,11 LOCATION OF OTHER WITNESSES FIGURE 2 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Congress: \"You'd have to try real hard to get caught.\" He said they probably catch less than one-tenth of the traffic funneling through the gaps. Kay Cormier, spokeswoman for NORAD Headquarters in Colorado Springs, Colorado said: \"We realize our air defense system is archaic, outmoded and outdated. It was fine 20 years ago .when we feared a high- altitude bomber threat more than a cruise missile threat.\" .Improvements are in the works Holes in the southern radar fence will be plugged by Over the Horizon- Backscatter radar, a system that bounces a radar signal off the ionosphere back toward Earth. This system will be operational in the 1970s. A PAVE PAWS phase-array radar system will go into operation near San Angelo in 1987. None of these capabilities were available, in 1980. The first line of defense along the Texas Gulf Coast is the 147th Fighter- Interceptor Group of the Texas Air National Guard, stationed at Ellington Field near Houston. They react to instructions from Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida. When Tyndall says there is .something in the Gulf, this group investigates and intercepts. Low level flyers won't be noticed. One possibility for low altitude . coverage along the Gulf Coast is the Air Force Airborne Warning and Control (AWACs) aircraft. These planes look down from above and' can spot low flyers. Their success rate for catching drug traffickers is pretty poor. Texas Governor Mark White said that in 1984 the.AWACs used for drug surveillance along the Gulf Coast failed to lead to a single arrest after 500 hours of flying time. Many more examples of the holes in the southern radar net could be cited; .but it is not necessary for this investigation. Figure 2 graphically displays the magnitude of the problem. With reports of UFO sighting near Liberty, Dayton, Huffman, and Crosby, Texas on December 29, 1980, though, one can generate scenarios about the activity that night. Since the purpose of this Investigator's Note is to define the magnitude of the \"lack of radar coverage\" problem, scenarios about land-.bases or ship-based military operations, or the actual origin of the UFO will be disregarded. They have been described elsewhere. UFO APPROACH The lack of low-altitude radar coverage suggests a scenario having the UFO enter the United States by flying over the Gulf of Mexico at low altitude, crossing the coastline between Morgan City and Lake Charles, Louisiana or between Lake Charles and Beaumont, Texas. Once inland it turned westward and moved slowly to the point where it hovered over the road in front of Cash and Landrum. From that point it curved to the southwest and finally to the south to follow the river and fly over the sparsely settled areas to eventually cross the coastline again, this time near Baytown, Texas. The flight path for this scenario is shown in Figure 3. Using the same information about . the radar coverage, other scenarios can be formulated as possible explanations for the Cash-Landrum incident. However, the coastline crossing scenario is supported by the data shown in this and the other Investigator's Notes. SUMMARY The lack of radar data has hampered the investigation of the Cash-Landrum case. In particular, good radar coverage could have shown beyond a shadow of a doubt where the UFO came from, where it went, and the extent of the helicopter activity. Knowing that the Texas Gulf Coast is almost totally lacking in radar coverage does explain how the UFO could operate almost without official detection. This situation holds true regardless of the origin of the UFO - from the United States, from foreign powers, or from outer space. ® 1986 John Schuessler CHURCHILL, Continued seeking enlightenment in this area and we plan to continue our efforts. Timothy Good, perhaps 'the leading figure in U.K. research, has already individually substantiated some suspicions. It is clear, for example, that the government department which holds UFO reports, .Air Staff 2, is nothing more than a public relations department. Carefull investigation and examination of the few documents that have been released here over the past few years indicate that the U.K. cover- up is at least as extensive, and perhaps even more secure, than its American counterpoint. UFO researchers in the United States simply do not realize how lucky 12 they are in contrast to our own position. Your Freedom of Information Act gives civil i'ans access to numerous government files. Here in Britain we have to wait at least 30 years for UFO tidbits like these, which are then parceled out like bread crumbs. What we want, of course, is the whole loaf, the Air Intelligence study, and other papers that may have been involved in its preparation, documents that may still influence current Ministry of Defence UFO policy. Unfortunately, we may have to wait another 30 years to see them. ADAMSKI, Continued early 70's, when the cost of electricity shot up by 500% or more in some areas. Still, it's likely some of them survived — and survive to this day — as heaters for homemade chick brooders. As I recall, tremendous heat came from them, both upwards and downwards and I can remember my great-uncle, who was a bookkeeper for a lumber company in Austin, Texas, in the 1930's and 1940's, sitting at his bookkeeper's desk on an ordinarily warm spring day, his shirt unbuttoned almost to his waist, his sleeves rolled up, a green celluloid eyeshade on his bald head, and sweat pouring from his. face from the heat of his light.

Saturday evening March 1,1986 at approximately 8:30 PM the UFO Information Service in Seattle, Washington- and the National UFO Reporting Center started receiving calls of a UFO sighting in the direction • of Payne Field. Witnesses said that they had spotted these objects while driving on Interstate 5 near the north side of Mountlake Terrace. The. witnesses described the objects as large in size, although they could only see lights. When questioned further, they said the objects were the size of a quarter at arms length. The witnesses said that there were nine objects total. .They also said that small white and blue objects were dropping out of some of the larger objects but did not hit the ground, instead they headed north at fast 'rates of speed. When asked how many witnesses altogether there were, the witness said he counted fifteen cars pulled off to the side of the freeway observing the UFO's. The total duration of the sighting was about 30 minutes. .The larger objects were then seen heading north also in formation. At exactly 11:00 PM all three news networks in Seattle, Washington gave their 'account of the sighting. All three had a different story. One explanation given was that the FAA said that Payne Field was having aerial maneuvers. Another station said they called Payne Field and they stated that . it was. possibly balloons. Later on, that night a radio station gave a description of another sighting which took place at 8:30 PM over Snoqualamie's pass by two pilots. The pilots said while they were'flying over Snoqualamie Pass they noticed two amber spheres coming their way. The pilots said that they were on a collision course with these two objects and went into evasive action to avoid the collision. After the pilots had leveled off, two objects turned around and started to follow their plane. The : pilot tried to use his'radio and said-it was inoperative due to heavy static. The pilot said that one object was on one side of the wing and one on the other. The objects . then accelerated at phenomenal speeds heading due west in the direction of Seattle at which time the pilot's radio became operative again. The next day after the sighting, CUFON, the computer UFO network, called Payne Fieldarid. talked with Sargent Tinsley-Army Operations. She checked flight records for that evening and said that there were no military maneuvers going on at Payne Field ..at the date and time of the sighting. She also stated that most of the time they do not have maneuvers going on after 9:00 PM because of the noise levels. This is-a highly residential area also. • . • ... /.CUFON also contacted 1 KING radio to get the name of the'pilots for further investigation. The name of the pilot who had the sighting was Shawn Kiaer a student pilot who was accompanied by his instructor'pilot. The pilot's story was verified. 'CUFON then called the FAA which stated that the sightings over Payne Field were probably Army Operations having maneuvers. COLLISION By coincidence there was a head- on collision with two small single engine aircraft two weeks prior to this sighting. Two witnesses observed two planes colliding overhead in the Black Diamond, Washington area. The witnesses described one plane exploding in the air on impact, then falling towards the ground. They said the other plane then went on its own way. Although the witnesses said there were two planes, none of them was able to describe it accurately and the plane that departed was never found. Two days after the incident, a helicopter that was leased by photographers for National Geographic was found crashed. The photographers, were found dead in the helicopter near Mount Saint Helens. The wreckage was found on flat ground with no reasonable, explanation according to FAA. CUFON contacted FAA investigations to find out if they had any detail on both accidents. The FAA investigator told CUFON that the helicopter may have had a \"whiteoiit.\" When asked about, the mid-air collision with the two single engine aircraft, the FAA investigator said he didn't believe there was another plane involved. This meant that he was disregarding .the testimony of the witnesses. As to this date, there has been no wreckage found of the second aircraft.

In fact, I've searched long and hard for one I could photograph for my friend Walt Andrus, and as yet I haven't been able to locate an example. ' Still,.perhaps somebody out there knows where one still hangs, unused and forgotten, in the back of an old store, and can photograph it to be placed alongside the well-publicized Adamski photos of the 'flying saucer' so all doubt can be removed once and for all.\" • MUFON AMATEUR RADIO NET 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"OTHERS'WORDS By Lucius Parish Did Prince Charles see a UFO' while flying from the.U.S.Jp London on February 23, 1986?

Here is the scenario: By the end of this century, Project Argus, the long and patient search for intelligent life in the universe, seems to have succeeded. A radio signal originating in the vicinity of Vega is beaming to Earth a constant stream of consecutive prime numbers, startling evidence that an advanced race is seeking to communicate with us. The President has been informed and has called an emergency meeting at the White House. With her are the National Security Council, a Special Contingency Task Force of science advisors, two representatives of Project Argus, and the Director of Central Intelligence. As the meeting begins, the President turns to the CIA man and asks, \"First does this have anything to do with flying saucers?\" The Director explains to the President that UFOs were of intermittent interest in the Air Force and the CIA, particularly in the '50s and '60s, because of the fear that reports might be a threat to security by overloading communications or spreading confusion in the event of a national emergency. Some reports, he says, turned out to be overflights by advanced Russian or Cuban aircraft, but the great majority were found to be misidentifications of aircraft, headlights, balloons, luminescent insects, or the moon, stars or planets seen under unusual atmospheric conditions. A significant number were discovered to be hoaxes or psychiatric delusions. In fact, from the time that the term \"flying saucer\" was first, used in the late '40s, more than a million UFO sightings had been reported worldwide, but with no evidence to connect them with extraterrestrial visitation. However, he continues, the reports generated \"fringe groups and publications,\" and even \"some academic . scientists\" had seen a possible connection between UFOs and life on other worlds. But the Air Force closed its Blue Book investigation for lack of progress, and NASA turned down President Carter's request for a comprehensive study because the scientific community was convinced that nothing could come of it. ; ' \" \"All right...Is there anybody around this table who thinks UFOs and this signal from Vega have anything to do with each other?\" the President asks. Negative. \"Just the same,\" she concludes, \"there's going to be an awful lot of I-told-you-so's from the UFO yo- yo's.\" So there you are, yo-yo's. If you were thinking you might read Carl Sagan's book, Contact, his first venture into science fiction, to see whether he said anything about UFOs, you can stop right there on page 106. According to Sagan, by the end of the century the CIA will know that UFOs, a thing of the past, were just lights in the sky tht could all be explained. Photographs and physical evidence cases, apparently, were all hoaxes, and close encounters were products of sick minds. But take a long walk, .a 'Cold shower, or a stiff drink — whatever lowers your hackles — and go on with the book. Sagan writes well, as evidenced before in his non-fiction best sellers. He is adequate to the challenges of fiction, in plot, character development, pace, and so on, but not dazzling. He takes excursions along the way into the fields of philosophy and religion, and throws in a modicum of politics and sex. He projects ultimate questions on a celestial screen. There are disappointments. For example, I can say without giving away the plot that at one point he had the opportunity to be brilliantly original, but instead he served up a thinned-out and warmed-over Martian Chroncles soup. The most intellectually titillating part of the book is Sagan's concept of how travel through space might be achieved. The physics is beyond my rudimentary understanding, but his acknowledgments at the end of the book, no less than his own qualifications, are impressive. For instance, he thanks \"Professor Thome\" (not otherwise identified) who \"took the trouble to consider the galactic transportation system described herein, generating fifty lines of equations in the relevant gravitational physics.\" I'll take the professors' word for it and assume that given the money, the determination, the time, and the technology, this theoretical \"relevant gravitational physics\" might be worth trying. Dr. J. Allen Hynek once wrote that you would expect to find planets around a star like you would expect to find kittens around a cat, and if only one star out of ten in the universe were circled by a planetary system on which life could evolve, then the number of life-supporting stars might be a one followed by nineteen zeros. In such a fecund universe, where surely a few million inhabited planets are far older than Earth, perhaps at some time in the past, on some other worlds, some beings like Professor Thorne only in their familiarity with the universal language of mathematics also generated fifty lines of relevant gravitational physics. And maybe their worlds, more advanced and more adventurous .than our own, have put the theory to the test. Perhaps we yo-yo's; if not Dr. Sagan, are seeing in the sky the elegant proof of their hypotheses. Read the book and think about it. -Mildred Biesele Contributing Editor 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"NEWS'N'VIEWS The MUFON 1986 UFO Symposium Proceedings are .a . memorial tribute to the Dean of Ufology and a pioneer in the quest for solutions , to the UFO enigma.

He has been recognized as the top authority jn the world by the general public and the news media for his courageous approach to the UFO phenomenon .and for placing , his professional stature as an astrophysicist \"on-,the line.\" When the Army Air Force, Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright AFB in Dayton, Ohio was assigned the responsibility for the investigation of flying saucers, Dr. Hynek was a professor in the .Astronomy Department at Ohio State University and Director of the McMillin .Observatory. Due to his proximity and . expertise, he was contracted to serve as a scientific consultant to the Air Force, a position he held until Project Blue Book was closed in December 1969. As ah astronomer, he was hired for the .purpose of explaining UFO sightings as astronomical anomalies. .By 1949, Dr. Hynek had \"reached the conclusion the \"there were a number of truly puzzling reports for which the data were hot sufficient to base positive, conclusions.\" In 1953, he stated to the Robertson pane] that \"the subject (of UFOs) is worthy of..further scientific invetigations.\" After the Michigan \"swamp gas\" incident in 1965, Dr. Hynek wrote an article for the Saturday Evening Post (1966), in'which he clearly.delineated his personal position concerning the phenomenon known as unidentified flying objects.

Allen Hynek, the Center's Scientific Director since 1973. Dr. Hynek, 75, died of cancer in Scottsdale, Arizona, on Sunday, April 27. Just like his favorite author Mark Twain, Hynek was born in the year of Halley's comet (1910) and died in the year of its return (1986) — two months after getting a dim glimpse of the comet in the Arizona desert. Hynek served as Astronomical Consultant to the United States Air Force on unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1948 to 1968. He was the first speaker to present testimony at the 1968 hearings on UFOs held by the House Committee on Science and Astronautics. In the early 1970s Hynek coined the phrase \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" used by Steven Spielberg as a title for his 1977 motion picture. Hynek was technical advisor and had a cameo appearance in that film. In 1978, he was a speaker at the United Nations meeting on the proposed establishment of an international agency to coordinate research on UFOs and related phenomena.  : Hynek cofounded the Center for UFO Studies in 1973 with Sherman J. Larsen, a retired Glenview businessman, who is currently President and Chief Executive Officer. The purpose of the Center is the collection, analysis and dissemination of information relating to the UFO phenomenon. CUFOS offices are currently located in Glenview, Illinois. A library and case files are open to serious UFO researchers. Inquiries and reports of sightings should be sent to: J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies, 1955 John's Drive, Glenview, IL 60025; (312) 724-2480. The Center publishes a bimonthly magazine, the International UFO Reporter (IUR), and maintains a national,network of professional UFO investigators. and consultants. In memory of Dr. Hynek, the May/June 1986 issue of IUR will be entirely devoted to his life and accomplish- ments. Hynek's books on UFOs were well received by both skeptics and proponents. He is the author of The UFQ Experience: A- Scientific Inquiry (1972); coauthor, with Jacques Vallee, of The Edge of Realty (1975); and author of The Hynek UFO Report (1977). In 'accordance with Hynek's wishes, the CUFOS Board of Directors confirmed Mark Rodeghier, currently in the Sociology Department at the University of Illinois at Chicago, as the new Scientific Director.

Your Director met Mr. Kinder at the recent NUFOC in Phoenix, Arizona and found him to be THE NIGHT SKY By Walter N. Webb MUFON Astronomy Consultant JULY 1986 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Venus shines brilliantly in the western twilight, setting about 10:30 PM daylight time in mid^July. Its magnitude in midmonth is -4.1 and still brightening. On the 10th the crescent moon is only 3° above our nearest planet which, in turn, lies but 1° above the first-magnitude star Regulus. Mars, retrograding in Sagittarius, reaches a point opposite the sun on July 10 and therefore rises in the ESE as the sun sets. Six days later the red planet is at its nearest to earth in the last 15 years-37,500,000 miles. At that time its tiny disc appears almost as large as it ever gets, and it shines at -2.6 magnitude or as bright as Jupiter. Except for the fact that Mars lies quite low in the sky for Northern Hemisphere observers, this is a fine opportunity for telescopic observers to study the planet's dark features, shrinking south polar cap, and occasional clouds. The dark patterns are now known to be desert regions like the rest of the planet and not areas of vegetation as once believed by some astronomers. Jupiter, in Aquarius, rises about 11 PM in midmonth in the east. The largest planet has brightened to magnitude -2.6 and begins retrograde or westward motion on the 13th. Saturn, retrograding in Scorpius, stands low in the south at dusk. The ringed world is above and to the right of the red star Antares. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars sets in the WSW about sunrise. The moon is near the planet on the morning of the 20th. Jupiter is in the south at dawn. On the 25th the moon lies only 1.5° from the giant world.    . Saturn sets in the WSW about 2 AM. Meteor Shower: The Delta Aquarids attain their maximum on the mornings of July 28 and 29. The rate is about 20 meteors per hour before dawn. However, the last-quarter moon will interfere.

Donald M. Ware, State Director for Florida has approved the appointment of James W. Moseley as the new State Section Director for Monroe County, which encompasses Key West. Currently, Jim is best known for his privately published newsletter titled \"Saucer Smear\" and as permanent chairman of the National UFO Conference. Gary L. Hamilton, a resident of Franklin, Indiana, is the new State Section Director for Johnson County. A Senior Customer Service Agent for an airline in Indianapolis, Mr. Hamilton has cultivated some good contacts. * * * Mr. Milton W. Hourcade, MUFON Representative for Uruguay, recently announced the 28th anniversary of Centre de Investigacion de Objetos Voladores Inidentificados (CIOVI) as a UFO investigative and research organization, with headquarters in Montevideo. Mr. Hourcade represents both MUFON and CUFOS in Uruguay. We send our best wishes for their continued success and cooperation with their counterparts in the U.S.A. Stan Gordon, State Director for Pennsylvania, has provided a brief report on PASU (Pennsylvania Association for the Study of the Unexplained) as an idea or incentive for other investigative teams. In addition to their monthly investigator training meetings in the Greensburg area, they have re-organized their 24-hour quick- response investigative team made up of specialists including medical and science personnel. This unit is identified by the letters PASU PRT, for phenomena response team. They have accumulated a considerable amount of scientific data gathering equipment while some of the members are designing other useful equipment for the team. Stan is preparing an article for a future issue of the Journal, relating to recently investigated cases in Pennsylvania. * * * As the computer becomes a more important segment of UFO research, sighting reports, information, and as a communication instrument via the telephone lines, the following update is being provided. Dale D. Goudie, 4109 Lake Washington Blvd., South Seattle, WA 98118 and telephone (206) 721- 5035 has advised that his new network called CUFON, which stands for Computer UFO Network, is now receiving from 40 to 50 calls per day. The primary functions of CUFON are to provide fast and reliable information for organizations and researchers nationally, which can be verified from the UFO Information Service or the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle, Washington, operated by Robert Gribble. The computer/ modem number is (206) 722-5738. Please contact Mr. Goudie for details if you are interested in participating in this network. The above network, CUFON, The Stars: The Summer Triangle has ascended high in the SE late in the evening, while below it already appear the vanguard of the autumn constellations--the Great Square of Pegasus, Aquarius, and Capricornus. Low in the southern sky Sagittarius the Archer aims his arrow at the heart of Scorpius, Antares. As occurred in May, the moon once again occults Antares on the night of July 17- 18. (At Los Angeles the red star disappears behind our satellite from only 8:45 to 8:56 PM local time; the time at Chicago is 11:05 to 12:11; and at Boston Antares is hidden at 12:28, but the moon sets before the star reappears.) The July sky offers some superb telescopic treats for backyard astronomers- the Globular Star Cluster of Hercules, Ring Nebula of Lyra, dumbbell Nebula in Vulpecula, and a host of nebulae and clusters in the Milky Way region of Sagittarius, including the Lagoon and Trifid Nebulae. should not be mistaken for COMPUFON operated by Michael D. Hart, which is still operational as far as we know. PARANET is a small but growing network of computerized Bulletin Board Systems, which attempt to make available the latest and most reliable information on the paranormal and \"fringe\" sciences. For more information on this new service call the National Fringe Science Information Service in Fountain Hills, Arizona at (602) 837- 9383 or Para Net Alpha: \"The Other Side,\" at (602) 837-0062, 300/1200 24 hours. Information concerning the network may also be obtained by writing to Jim Speiser, P.O. Box 17675, Fountain Hills, AZ 85268. * * * The Computer UFO Newsletter is a relatively new publication, published in conjunction with the Italian Center for UFO Studies by Maurzio Vcrga, Editor. It is without a doubt the most comprehensive newsletter in the world devoted exclusively to the applications of the computer to ufology. As of June 1986, five issues of 20 pages each (bi- monthly) have been typed using a word processor (English) and a Commodore 128 micro-processor. To subscribe to \"The Computer UFO Newsletter\" send an International Postal Money Order (no checks will be accepted) of 18,000 Italian lire (surface mail) to: Maurizio Verga, via Matteotti 85, 22072 Cermenate (Como), ITALY. The Mutual UFO Network does not accept any responsibility for the operations of these computer networks, since they are all privately owned. MUFON is simply sharing this information with our readers, knowing that many have a sincere interest in utilizing their personal computers for UFO information or communications. Both Dale Goudie and Jim Speiser are MUFON members who attended the recent NUFOC in Phoenix, Ariz. An exchange of publications between The Computer UFO Newsletter and the MUFON UFO Journal was initiated with the June 1986 issue. 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE by Walt Andrus National UFO Information Week, sponsored by the Mutual UFO Network in cooperation with the Center for UFO Studies and the Fund for UFO Research, will be held from August 10 to 17, 1986 nationwide as a public education program. Due to the tremendous success of the 1985 endeavor when 43 state organizations participated, this could become an annual UFO information vehicle under the guidance and leadership of Marge Christensen, Public Relations Director. A packet of informational material was mailed the week of June 9th to all State Directors, some Asst. State Directors, and members of the P.I.P.E. Committee, including Issue Number 35 of the MUFON National Newsletter. The resources that each state organization will need to implement their program in conjunction with local displays, consisted of the following items: a News Release announcing the up-coming event composed by Dan Wright; three sample radio spot announcements by Marge Christen- sen; an 8 l / 2 x 11 inch black-and-white announcement poster designed by Donald Schmitt; and samples of handouts for meetings, exhibits, displays and public speeches, including a Recommended Reading List by Barry Greenwood, a MUFON information sheet and a MUFON UFO JOURNAL application. Additional copies for distribution should be printed locally based upon your anticipated needs. If you have not started making detailed plans for public events within your state or immediate area, it is not too late to start immediately. * * + The MUFON 1986 UFO Symposium at Michigan State University had the finest group of academic speakers of any prior symposium in MUFON's seventeen year history. Congratulations and accolades to Dan Wright and his superb symposium committee for DAN WRIGHT conducting such an enlightening and educational conference. The outstanding accommodations provided a congenial atmosphere for this annual event. For those who were unable to attend to hear the speakers, the MUFON 1986 UFO Symposium Proceedings (186 pages), depicting the theme \"UFOs: Beyond theMainsiream of Science,\" are available by mail for $10.00 plus $1.50 for postage and handling in U.S. funds via fourth class book rate postage. (Foreign orders will be accepted by international postal money order, a check redeemable from a U.S. bank, or cash.) * * * For the Mutual UFO Network to be an effective organization, the \"grass roots\" structure requires competent leadership at the State levels. Edward F. Mazur has been promoted from a State Section Director to the position of State Director for Arkansas, filling the vacancy created when Bill Pitts recently resigned. Ed is an electrical engineer and amateur radio operator N5BRE, residing with his wife Elaine in Mena, Ark. Former State Section Director for Maricopa County, Hal Starr has accepted the responsibility of State Director for Arizona replacing William H. Spaulding. Since Mr. Spaulding's current idealogies are not compatible with the goals and objectives of MUFON, he feels that this is a wise decision. Bill has been the State Director for Arizona and a Consultant in Photo Analysis, utilizing computer enhancement techniques, for 15 years. He was the host chairman for the MUFON 1977 UFO Symposium and published papers in both 1976 and 1977. He will be discontinuing his complimentary UFO photo analysis to MUFON. I personally want to thank Bill for his professional services throughout the years. He will be sadly missed in this regard. On the positive side, the enthusiasm, personality and leadership talent of Mr. Starr engenders growth for ufology in Arizona. Hal has the enviable accomplishment of having produced the longest continuous- running daily syndicated UFO radio series in the world (since 1947), broadcasted in 7 English-speaking countries. * * * Paul C. Cerny, Western Regional Director, has designated Marvin E. Taylor, Jr. of Sonora, Calif, as the new State Director for Northern California. Mr. Taylor has been involved in the study of UFOs for 39 years and has one of the most complete newspaper clipping scrapbooks, starting in 1947, that your Director has had the privilege of viewing. Marvin operates a public museum of UFO memorabilia in Sonora in conjunction with his real estate and tax consulting business. He has been a dedicated member of MUFON since 1974. Thomas D.
