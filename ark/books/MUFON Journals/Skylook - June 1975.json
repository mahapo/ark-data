Light beams from alleged UFOs are nothing new, but they continue to gener- ate interest and speculation. In this month's SKYLOOK are stories concern- ing reported light beams in Tasmania, Australia, and in the Soviet Union. The sketch at left represents an un- confirmed, but interesting, sighting at Elleielles, Belgium, on July 4, 1972. At 10:45 p.m. a young farmer was reportedly in a field adjoining his farm when his attention was captured by intermittent projections of bluish light coming from a luminous \"cloud\" which was motionless in the sky. These beams, in the form of an arc, descended to the ground and touched it at three points, arranged around the wit- ness in a triangle, and then went back up into the \"cloud.\" The beams reportedly widened until about three feet above the field, then narrowed down to touch the soil as a very reduced point—and reversed the process when returning upward. These extra- ordinary \"Hashers\" were reportedly re- produced every 30 seconds. The incident was reportedly confirmed by a neighbor a few yards away.

DATE OF SIGHTING: Feb. 26, 1975. REPORTED BY: Paul B. Jackson, Tasmanian UFO Investigation Centre (TUFOIC). SUBMITTED BY: Joe Brill, former MUFON International C6-ordinator. THE MAIN WITNESS The principal witness has requested that his name not be used. He was a rear gunner in the RAAF, is currently a \"well- off\" professional man, and is apparently a respected member of his community. He is also a competent artist. The principal witness had gone to Lake Sorell with a companion (a commercial artist) on a week's fishing trip. The companion also observed the in- cident and also made sketches. TRANSCRIPT OF SIGHTING Following is a transcript of an interview with the principal witness by the Tasmanian UFO Investigation Centre. The in- itial portion of the transcript i-s the witness 1 statement pre- ceding questions from the in- terviewer. WITNESS: At about.3:^5 p.m. approximately, with some degree of daylight, I observed 3 ob- jects in the sky in. the NE: two larger, one smaller. 1 watched them for some, time, thinking they were rather un- usual small clouds .or even air- craft; after observing them for a while I noticed that they were moving in a different di- rection to the clouds. They were too slow in movement to be aircraft, or anything, and I was extremely interested in the object at this time being more than unusual.. They remained in this area for a few minutes and I lost sight of them for about 3 or 4 area covered by be. / sighting 845pm CAMP' SITE KELLY '<**. 1 1 Camp site IOOO yds fiom closest sighting minutes. Later I observed two of the objects much closer that had travelled in a direction towards the SW, towards Lake Sorell. They came to a sta- tionary position towards the Dogshead, which is on the east- ern shore of Lake Sorell, and remained in that area for ap- proximately 3 to 10 minutes. There was slight movement then, and I lost them in cloud. There, was broken cloud for a while, but they receded towards the mountainous shore towards Lake Penny (note: ... probably means . Mt. Penny), which is known as the Hatchery shore .of Lake Sorell. CENTRAL RED LIGHT The two were clearly visible there for a while, and then I first noticed that underneath each was showing a central, red light which was pulsating, and on the.one that appeared to be larger or closer .there were intermittent red 1 ightsjaround the corona or rim. That is the last time that I saw the two; cloud intervened and there was no sighting for some minutes, and then the. cloud brightened up and I saw one object emerge frpm the clouds travelling in an easter- ly direction and come to rest above Meredith or sometimes called Murdoch Point on the north shore of Lake Sorell. The secondary object was at that stage of the piece noticed stationary towards Mt., Penny much further to the north— approximately 2£ miles to the north. The main object was now very clear in definition. It;was an elongated shape. It wasia long disc type of sighting, with the red light very very 'strong, still pulsating, but the red lights around the corona also seemed to be twinkling from red to white. At times.they seemed to be travelling around the Page 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"disc; at other times seemed to be quite stationary. It re- mained in this area for 8 to 10 minutes. ; The sighting at all times wasn't clear because there was intermittent cloud that at times would partially obscure the main object. It was totally obscured for 2 or 3 minutes with a heavy bank of cloud that went through with a passing storm; it appeared again and appeared to be fractionally closer. Then all of a sudden it came directly towards us at phenome- na] speed. It appeared as though it was going directly over the top of us — but-in ac- tual fact it came to rest ap- proximately 1000 yards away and assesed at approximately 500 feet up. It remained in this aro,a in clear vision for quite some minutes, maybe 3, maybe *t minr utes. It was very, very bright, intensly bright during the per- iod of movement towards us, al- most to the extent it was like the flash of an -acetylene torch. When it came to rest, the main lights dulled. You could see the' definition ' and outline, which appeared to be a round forming 'ring around the bottom of a dome, with a dome\" effect on the top. ••• AREA COVERED BY BEAM The red light very, very clear in the bottom; it moved very, very well in a small de- gree in a little arc back and forth, then extended with col- lossal light a beam, a cone- shaped beam down- towards the lake. This beam appeared to travel towards the northern section of the lake, which was the edge of Robinson's Swamp, and it very definitely was directed along the extremity of the- swamp in extending a distance of approx- imately 2 miles. It was strong enough that it lit up the side of the mountain along from the Point of Meredith to Robinson's Swamp, approximately 3/*» of a Page 4 too o\\rscujr«l for- clior mi le. LAKE SURFACE GLOWS The beam traversed back to- wards the centre of the area from where the object was in the sky. It faded and fairly quickly, and the surface of the lake appeared as though it had a.bluey white flourescent glow over the water for approximate- ly 20 or 30 feet above. Suffi- ciently that you could still see the outline of the swamp strongly. The red lights had reappeared; the definition of the outline was quite clear. Then, almost like a flash, it disappeared away very quick- ly towards the NE. It travelled at a collossal speed—as much as I would liken it would be something in the way the tra- jectory of a tracer bullet. At this time the second ve- hicle that had moved towards Mt. Penny and had remained in that area for the whole time disappeared at the simultaneous time with the other one, in the same direction. I cannot be sure whether it disappeared in the beyond, or went beyond the rim of the mountain, but it was that quick that it was hard to be definite. CAR RADIO AFFECTED During the period of the ve- hicle being in the area of Mer- edith Point, my car radio, which was in operation with the door open--I had been waiting for the nine o'clock news — had cut out and was replaced by a very, very loud intense staticy noise. At one stage during a -<*• lull in the sighting I attempt- ed to find stations on the wireless; it did not respond. , When the vehicles had gone out of sight within a minute or two the wireless came on and func- tioned quite normally, and re- mained quite normal thereafter. These are the main points of the actual sighting, but there were quite a few little inci- dents here and.there that oc- curred during the trajectory of the vehicles. QUESTIONS BY INVESTIGATOR TUFOIC: The moon did rise in the SE—about 9:^5 p.m. This would be after the sighting. WITNESS: Well, when it'just started to show approximately i of an hour after the actual sighting, but it was from the camp site in the SE down to- wards the lower part of the lake. Towards the Guest House area, which is more than a quarter of the compass spec- trum. The following night I was still at the lake and ob- served the moon rise which was a little later, but was the same position, so there is no mistake on where it rises. The only thing I was concerned on checking up on the moon was the fact that when I first saw the 3 objects at a great distance, although it was quite daylight at the time, it appeared like light on cloud—and through"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Sketch by witness that... TUFOIC: Like the reflection of light of the moon on cloud. W: Yes, that was my first impression, then I thought they were aircraft. But when they moved in closer into the area of the sighting, actually the main sightings themselves were almost in an opposite direction altogether as to what you would look, for the moon. Another thing with it top that was quite important, the cloud banks and the cloud cover .that was across the lake on quite a few occasions, anything up to. half a dozen times the light from the craft itself was show- ing up our side of the. cloud in bright 'relief, and this side of the mountain, so the l.ight had .to be reflected from this side.' T: This was opposite the swamp area and off the Meredith Pt. area. W: So the object had to,be centered oh : this side to be able to reflect the light on this side, while on the other side this was in darkness and the.movement... T: .You .were only getting a reflection, of the ; light from the object on the cloudside of the. clouds that.were closest to it. ... ' '.'\"'.

I thought it was important this be noted and checked out. EFFECT ON WITNESS T: At any time you had no feeling of being affected by the closeness of the object. W: No, no physical phenomena in any way, shape, or form, but I did have a rather apprehen- sive feeling, more or less like a sense of fear. ' T: Fear of the \".unknown. W: Well,' this was as close as you could describe -it--ex- pecting something sort of. cata- clysmic to happen, but it did- n't. After the actual sighting itself I was left with a rather strange state of void. I felt rather uneasy and a little bit unreal, but nothing physical in any way, shape, or form. T: It didn't make you feel ill, headache, or anything. W: No, the only physical effect I saw was the effect it had on the radio. T: What about the intense brightness of it on your eyes. W: To a degree, I noticed that each time the vehicle moved it glowed very brightly, but was nothing at all like the intensity of the beam when it moved close i.n above, and when it directed the beam down, it was a light like an acetylene flash to a certain degree; it did have a slight effect on,the eyes. T: You couldn't look at it di rect. W: You could look at it and look away, but the only effect it had was the intensity of the light during that period.of the extension of the beam. T: Now when the beam of light was over this swamp. 100 yards area of beam on the swamp. : W: I would .say that the main centre of .the beam would have covered an area of 200 yds or in excess of that—but it also from the the edge of that main point of beam it extended a brightness, that lighted, up the area for almost 2 miles either side. . . . T: Did you notice any wild- life in the swamp; were there any effects. W: Usually there are swans back in behind the swamp and sometimes duck, that would be the only thing—and . I certainly didn't notice anything in any way. . T: Did you notice anything the next day. W: As a matter of fact I know one thing: there were no ducks sighted because it was the verge of the duck season— the following day when I was on the lake there wasn't a duck to be seen. Whether I saw any swan or not I can't recall. T: You didn't have an ani- mal with you. W: No. T: You knew of other people at .SiIver Plains. W: Yes, well there was a party'camped at the top of Sil- ver Plains, which would have put them a mile or so below me. I was talking - to one of the fishermen from that group'the. following day. He told me that he was In the tent after dark, but he didn't know the time, and it lit up the tent like daylight and they came out and they could see this very bright object in the top end of the lake. T: He actually witnessed this at a later time after your first sighting of it. W: He saw what I did when the thing came in at its close proximity and then to when it left. T: And. that was at 100 yds. to your campsite at its clos- est. W: No, 1000yds--he was a mile below me. T: You don't know these .people's names. W: ' No I don't. OTHER WITNESSES T: Also led to believe there was somebody close at another camp further down at the end of Silver Plains swamp area. W: Yes, where the road first meets the lake they also, too— the other man told him that they saw it—but I didn't see them at all—during the time that I was there. And again I .^ don't know who they are or where they came from. T: There was another wit- ness involved; I believe they also have notes and drawings of what they saw.. W: Yes, well actually you have a set of drawings and notes there—but I told her you will, be seeing her and she could tell you herself her own story in her own way. T: You mentioned also when this object finally went away it went over Mt. Penny. W: Slightly south of Mt. Penny in a NE direction. T: At a very terrific speed that we would associate with a tracer. W: A phenomenal speed. T: Up until this time you have never seen or experienced anything in. the way of UFOs, or any other phenomena at all. W: All except heard of them, but I 've had no - experience of it before, and I was not very /^ convinced. I'm afraid, I cer- '- tainly was not. Well, I didn't have a closed mind on it, but } it was not important to me be- fore this affair. T: You've no doubt this was an UFO..... W: There isn't any doubt of this. I've had sufficent ex- perience to know that what t saw was an object; a vehicle in the sky. There's no doubt in the world and I saw it in close enough definition to know what it looked like.

The following report was re- ceived from a commercial air- line .pilot, and describes an observation made..on March 6, at 33,000 v feet altitude during a flight between Melbourne and Adelaide, Australia. \"We had departed Melbourne airport at 213*» EST/113** GMT en route to Perth, W. A. During the climb, we encountered cloud which generated St. Elmo's fire across .windscreen segments L1 and .R1 of the Boeing 727-100 I was flying in as co-pilot. \"At 61 nautical miles east of. -Mt. Gambier,. the flight engineer . sighted a falling .green object ahead and slightly to, the right of the aircraft nose, falling rapidly, no tail. The appearance .of the object was .that, of a fal 1 ing .flare. I took no notice in the initial instance, being concerned at that time with verifying our estimated time of arrival over Gambier and being about to ask the flight engineer to note the exact fuel over Gambier for later point of no return as- \"sessment. \"Ahead of us by some 5 min- .utes was .the ' other domestic carrier's. B727-100; that air- craft .reported .the sighting of the light, to .Ade.laide .control on transfer to Adelaide -AIC over Gambier. We passed over .Gambier at about .2200 EST/1200 GMT and took up .a track of 278 degrees magnetic en route di- rect to . Esperance, W. A. ATC asked us to comment on.... the sighting made by the other Boe- ing, a sighting which was also made by .a domestic airline's Fokker F27- as it passed over Ardrossan, S.A., on a southerly to easterly heading. I made generally confirmatory remarks over the radio; I gather the general impression that there was more than one light con- cerned over some small period of t i me. . , . \"At, about 76 nautical miles west of • Gambier, • I--noticed: to the.right 'of the aircraft and about 5 miles or so • to the north of us, a greenish glow on the'surface, visible with some diffusion, through the layer of stratiform cloud- below us. This I passed to Adelaide AIC, who confirmed the approximate area on a cross-check being made on the chart accessible to AIC. \"Immediately I tuned 500 khz on the aircraft's number two Automatic Direction Finder, just on a punt. . There was some feverish ,morse code activity for some, short time, then sl- lence. The ADF need.le pointed to the greenish glow, then re- turned to the 090/270 degrees \"Unusable .Signal\" direction, on cessation of the morse cod- ing. The coding was too fast to make out any letters clear-^ ly, and in any event, need not necessarily have been in plain language English, despite the fact that.this was the maritime distress frequency. There was nothing to be heard on 121.5 Mhz, the VHF distress frequen- cy, at any time. This I advised to Adelaide .ATC, who acknowl- edged my message. \"On return from Perth some six hours or so later, there was no visible evidence of any activity in this ; area, and the radios : were silent - on the aforementioned frequencies.... \"The other carrier's air- craft-was at 31,000 feet . AMSL on 1013 mbs at the time. -... \"Latitude of the glow: 37 16 S; Longitude 139 10 E; ap- proximate.\" \"I'd say the total... time someone had had it 'in sight would have been in the order of perhaps ten to twenty seconds, again a guesstimate -.only... The glow I referred to did not appear to be fluctuating, as in burning, nor did it appear to move in the short time I had it in sight—about .,30 seconds... \"Being open-minded enough' to admit that there are stranger things in fact than in fiction, I'm completely open- to any in- fo, and without wishing! to be dramatic,', the idea of a;, flare at 33 grand is a bit. way-out; but, if:that's what it was, then fair enough.\" UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE The UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE will keep you in- formed of all the latest United States and World-Wide UFO ac- tivity, as it happens!

The set- tlement is small and consisted of small boarding houses that extended along the river in one street. The side of the settlement away from the river is closely adjacent to the taiga. \"Evidently, therefore, in the evening as soon as the sun sets it is already dark on the ground but in return, the sky is easily observed and the stars appear early. \"In October, at approximately 2300 hours,. I left the office together with a group of about fifty working people after a conference. The office was lo- cated at one of the ends of the settlement and I set out for home, which was in the center. \"After about twenty to twenty-five meters from the of- fice I glanced up at a com- pletely clear sky and something strange appeared; with complete cloudlessness, one lone dark cloud was lit up by a weak red- dish light (a hazy glow), and only then did I notice that it was oscillating. A pencil of light began to emerge from the cloud very slowly. The impres- sion I received was such that some sort of body which emits light seemed to be separating EDITOR'S NOTE: This is another in a series of articles which Iron Curtain specialist Joe Brill has pre- pared from an unpublished series of reports compiled by Soviet UFO ex- pert Felix Y. Zigel, assistant profes- sor at the Moscow Aviation Institute. from the light it was emit- ting. \"The body withdrew farther and farther away parallel to the ground and, in proportion to this, the light beam grew longer, throwing its light on the cloud which had now become similar to a parachute but with the only difference was that it was not stretched from the air but it somehow wriggled its surface like a flag in a weak wind. • ' \"What was most instructive of all was the fact that the longer the beam of the body moving away from the 'para- chute 1 became, the lighter the 'parachute 1 itself became, ac- quiring a blue shade permeated with red streaks at one moment or, conversely, a red shade permeated with blue streaks at another moment. \"It did not descend and did not rise. The beam of light fell on it exactly on the cen- ter, not blinking and not bend- ing at all. The beam was like the beam of a motion picture projector; narrow at the exit from the body and expanding toward the 'parachute 1 which it illuminated. \"The pencil of light was ex- tremely dense and the light was very strong, but not blinding, somewhat like a white lumines- cent glow but considerably whi ter. \"The body which was emitting the light was not visible, but from some unclear shadow at the exit it was felt that it exist- ed. The outline of the 'para- chute' dissipated somehow, having no clear boundaries and at the moment of its deflec- tions some parts of it were sometimes lighter, sometimes darker, however preserving the color prevailing in a given position. \"From one to one and a half 4 minutes after the body moved a- way from the 'parachute' about twenty meters (that's how it appeared and during this one to one and a half minutes the 'emitter' moved away from the 'parachute') it somehow moved in the opposite direction along the same axis without jerks. \"The beam was shortened ac- cordingly and the luminescence of the 'parachute! was decreas- ed. Once, having reached the 'parachute; the beam seemed to enter it. \"The luminescence of both stoppedi Something like a cloud again appeared, and in the same instant it moved slowly in the direction .of the taiga and there, blending itself into the darkness, it ceased being vis- ible. \"Everything that occurred lasted no more than five min- utes. It is interesting to note that after the cessation of the luminescence the sen- * sation of onsetting darkness was absent as happens when you ; emerge from a brightly illumin- ated room into an evening street. All objects were dis- tinguished just as before this appearance. \"Turochak is a God-forsaken place, especially in the time period described.

Then this disc became cloudy and smoke was clearly seen in its place. After a while, this object disappeared and then a bright illuminated disc appear- ed similar to the first object in dimensions and appearance. Bright, divergent beams of light, as from the headlights .of an automobile, were. emitted from the second object twice for approximately half a minute each time. \"Both objects moved to, the northeast.

However, I cannot agree with him that we ought to be \"throwing in the towel\" just because, of., the possibility of being deceived by -the ETIs, or whatever one wishes, -to. call them. . First of all, I must concede, that he is correct—in refer- ring to the situation we are actually in--to indicate that the capabilities .of the ETIs are -not comparable to the Rus- sians.. But we do not know HOW far m, advance of.-the Russ.ians. - : ..The. si tuat-ion may be closer to :J the. : pi ight : ..of : .-the Aztecs when they first faced Cortez. When. :the Aztecs first con- fronted the. : . Spaniards ,.. they thought they-were gods; they thought horse and rider were one creature; -they were terri- fi.ed by cannon., . Again, we may be confronting a culture immeasurably advanced beyond -our own. But we ought to KNOW this;, it should not be an assumption. , - ARE THEY GODS? To the ETIs are often attri- buted • many characteristics formerly- reserved for God: in particular, omniscience and om- nipotence. If. one assumes these attributes are indeed possessed by the ETIs, then if we ARE be- ing deceived-by them, throwing in the towel. would .be justi- fied. .... I would like to make the reasonable assumption, however, that they are, both intellec- tually fallible and physically vulnerable—possibly even .. to weapons that we possess or might soon develop. I recognize that such a sug- gestion runs counter to what is probably the belief of most Ufologists; I know it., contra- dicts the eloquently expressed position of Aime Michel. Let.me quickly assert that I am NOT in favor of -a hot .war with the ETIs, under conditions that now exist'. But we mus.t recognize that we are constant- ly engaged in a BATTLE FOR IN- FORMATION with them. I think the statement that we are being kept in. the dark and confused by the ETIs. i.n various ways as to their identities, capabili- ties, and numbers is. readily justifiable in terms of sight- ings of which we are all aware. CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION UFO investigation is NOT 1ike ordinary scientific investiga- tion; it is much closer to criminal - investigation, in which the object of study tries to deprive -the -searcher of clues which are needed to fig- ure out what happened. 1 -. In this sense, .we ARE con- stantly trying to match wits with the ETIs. One can decide for one's self whether the \"ad- vances\" we have made are due largely to our own efforts, or to increased accessibility of the phenomenon .(through closer approaches, etc.). But this \"battle for infor- mation,\" critical as it is, is only part of the story. Our present style of investigation is predicated on one .critical assumption: a relatively LOW RATE of various kinds of.. UFO activity. This variable . is vital to consider, since a change (an increase) in the rate of any one kind of activity could cause immediate changes in so- cial patterns. A dramatic in- crease might cause the direct and open involvement of the government, and the many per- sons who like to talk about \"mass hysteria\" in relation to UFOs would have a chance to view the real thing - at first hand. . - So far, the kinds of activi- ty have been closely confined in numbers, time, and geog- raphy. .Would, anyone like to consider what would happen if the events which two summers ago took place in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, were to be \"generalized to the whole United States?2 Another question. Last De- cember, many of us in MUFON be- lieved that the Air Force was going to come out in that month and admit that UFOs exist. Ex- actly where this rumor first started, and why, would make an interesting study. I would like to ask, however, what, we would have done if this really hap-: pened? What if the Air Force claimed UFOs were real, and we were all required, by executive order, to report all sightings not to MUFON but to the Air Force? I think we ought to begin to consider what we will do if the rates of UFO activity of cer- tain kinds increase. I think we ought to consider what we will do if the ETIs do not rest content with harassing motor- ists and farmers, but land openly or communicate with us in some unequivocal way. I think we ought to begin now, in terms of using scenar- ios and \"contingency\" plans, to think about what we will do if we are forced to confront the ETIs. A good place to start is science fiction. One probable scenario is Arthur C. Clarke's CHILDHOOD'S END, in which ter- restrial culture is crushed, not through military might, but through the sheer weight of cultural superiority. Our own culture is heavily dependent, for its own sense of self-esteem, on technological superiority. Scientists and Page 10"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"their work have accordingly high' status. Clearly, contact with a technologically superior culture might force a change in our emphasis on these values. One strategy we could adopt, to cope with what might become a very serious problem of/our self-image, would be a greater emphasis on those aspects . of our culture which are uniquely- human. In other words, we might emphasize civilization instead of technology. - It is very likely that.humans will have to fight an over- whelming sense of futility, a sense that their own efforts are worthless. Note: this problem can arise even with a \"beneficent\" culture 1 pledged to a minimal degree of interfer- ence. THEIR SOCIAL ORGANIZATION I would like to raise another point, which may not be so ob- vious. . This regards the social organization .of the ET.Is. We often tend to think that they, being technologically more ad- vanced, have a, highly organized and disciplined social organi- zation. . Therefore, we interpret fly- bys, landings, contacts, and so forth as part of a systematic policy-:, the question is to de- termine what the policy i.s. However, at least two other possibilities ought to be con- sidered: 1) that there is no policy and 2) that much of the behavior_ that we see is } not part of a policy, but the ex- pression of individual impul-- ses, possibly in violation of whatever the policy is. In the former case, the sole guiding principle for contact with terrestrials might be per- sonal survival. In other words, there would be no restraints on contact except those imposed by the dangers to welfare of the individual ETIs. ' The second possibility seems to me the more likely. If there were a policy, it might be obeyed'with the same regularity that terrestials obey the speed limits. Landing might not be envisaged by overall policy, but might -be done anyway for the \"kicks\" of the individual ETIs. Therefore, also, those per- sons .who are hurt,' killed, or kidnaped by-UFOs would essen- tially represent. accidents.. This would explain much of the bizarre behavior that led Ivan Sanderson to suggest that the ETIs are insane.' THE BASIC PROBLEM But let us return to our basic problem. The need to keep track of various kinds of UFO activity is vital. I would suggest that most of the ways we measure UFO activity are un- satisfactory and ad hoc. . . • At the lowest level, the person who has no special in- terest in UFOs gauges activity by how often he reads about UFOs in the newspapers. . At the next level of sophis- tication, the \"buff\" thinks in. terms of \"flaps\" of act.ivi.ty, which are defined by UFOlogists in the periodicals like SKY- LOOK. UFOlogists. themselves tend to measure activity in- terms of the volume of investi- gations they and other, investi- gators are called upon to make. Numerical .compilations are hardly any better, since they tend to reflect, disproportion- ately those areas which have been highly searched: in other words, they are an artifact of the researcher as much as of the phenomenon. Thus, the ex- cellent research by Ted Bloe- cher on the 19^7 Wave reflects not only UFO activity but also Bloecher's searching.^ Those areas of time and place less intensely .searched are less represented i.n. the data. What are needed are \"Unob- trusive .Measures,\" measures which register activity inde- pendently of the researcher's efforts. -> ....:, Probably the closest ,thing to .such measures so far., have been the fiallup-pol1s of 1966 and 197^, which though they may have created interest in UFOs, have sampled the population in a way unrelated to UFO activ- ity.    - • .. .1 would suggest a similar source would be small-town newspapers, randomly distrib- uted around the country,;check-• ed once a month by people who were not known to: the.:, editors as UFO investigators.^ : What are needed are silent \"listening posts\" .to monitor UFO activities without, them- selves being conspicuous.' Richard Hall has asked, what• can be done about deception.. Against an omniscient opponent, the answer .is,-of course* noth- ing. Unt.il we establish, that••• the ETIs are.omniscient, . how- ever, there are several rule.s.., we can use in studying : , \\, UFO, sight ings.  •.->•••.-•.;-• '•  • ' •']-•;•••• RULE ONE  -..-:. i ...... 1) The first rule is: what does the sighting show . about; CAPABILITIES, as opposed.to IN- TENTIONS? It is much harder to. fake capabilities' than : it is intentions. Instead of . trying to interpret what the craft or. entities SEEMED to be .doing (their motivations or goals)., what did the sighting in. fact show them to be. capable,of ac- complishing? RULE TWO 2) The second rule ,is:- .be, cautious about . sightings or patterns of sightings that MAKE SENSE in. human terms. Not only may the \"sense\" involved, be er- roneous, but it may actually be contrived. In other wor ; ds, the \"obvious\" conclusions we draw may be those we are supposed to draw. It is.highly likely that the ETIs have evolved models of human society, and are using these models, to 'influence us.. > It is probable, however, that these .models have. a certain crudity, and that therefore they may go a bit too far, and occasionally show the nature of the operation. . . . (Continued) Page 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"RULE THREE The third and final rule follows directly from number 2: any sighting involving close contact is likely to be an at- tempt to transmit a particular message. The question that must be asked, then, is: what net impression .is the encounter likely to leave, not on the ob- server, but in the minds of those to whom the encounter is related? For instance, let us take the typical close-encounter sight- ing involving at least visual contact with-humanoids. In how<many cases do humans \"stumble upon\" humanoids in the process,of. \"exploring,\" picking up rocks, or just looking a- round? Unless one accepts the thrill-seeking hypothesis men- tioned earlier, it is hard to believe that these contacts are not contrived. Simply thinking in terms of the sensors available to the American military now, it is unthinkable that ETIs would not be able to identify the ap- proach of humans to their craft at a distance of several miles, let alone hundreds of feet. Hence it seems likely that the approaches have been, if not planned, at least not. unde- sired. 10 A discordant note is struck, however, by the landing in re- mote places: the mass of hu- manity is being avoided by UFO landings. Could it be that the ability to \"stage\" such events is limited, or involves risks which we do not know? It may be that the management of close contacts cannot be performed for a larger group. CALCULATED RESULTS? In any case, I think it high- ly likely that the net informa- tion achieved in each contact has been calculated beforehand. Certainly one of the tasks which the MUFON humanoid panel might set itself is the analy- sis of the \"net impression\" of humanoid contacts, first on a case-by-case basis, then on the basis of the whole sample. What has been the social reaction to these contacts? In what direc- tion has the \"push\" been? To those who believe that the ETIs cannot be hostile (af- ter all, they have shown little hostility so far, compared to what they might .have done), there is an obvious explana- tion: ETIs are getting us ready, on a very slow basis, for wider inter-species con- tacts. Thus the pace of activ- ity increases little by little. It seems extremely likely that our societies (American, Russian, French, Spanish, etc.) are being monitored for our re- action to contacts, and that the .pattern of contacts to come is contingent upon our reaction to the previous contacts. WHAT'S BEING WATCHED? Unfortunately, we have no way of knowing what variables in human life are being watch- ed. However, we do have some indication of what is being monitored from close-encounter reports, and it is my belief that a close analysis of the pattern of contact—particular- ly breaking off of contact— might disclose some interesting patterns of interaction. Charles Bowen, for instance, noted that the time between breaking off of contact and take-off of the UFO seems to be too short for the \"humanoids\" to have actually re-entered the craft before take-off in many contact cases. 11 Two critical variables that ought to be examined are 1) the number of witnesses 2) close- ness of contact—as they show up in the pattern of interac- tion. Again, this is a task which the humanoid panel might set for itself. The men-in-black business, I suspect, is partly the result of a desire to give form to our opponents on the other side of this battle for information. Although some men-in-black re- ports seem to have some sub- stance behind them, 12 the in- terest in such reports is much stronger .than the phenomenon itself would warrant. After asking for MIB reports from Skylook readers, the result was a few meager reports. 3 On the other hand, I got more letters asking for infor- mation about the MIB reports which all apparently supposed I was receiving. Doubtless some MIB-type harassment does exist; but the lore has by far outrun the phenomenon itself. It is hard to deal with an opponent that many others do not even believe exists. It is hard to deal with a phenomenon that seems to shed a multipli- city of contradictory cues as to its nature. It is not surprising that many try to examine such cues in the same way a scientist would try to examine a fossil. Such objectivity is insuffi- cient, however, when the avail- ability and nature of cues is subject to manipulation, par- ticularly by intelligences who have good reason to deceive us. It is as if dinosaurs could choose which skeletons would become fossilized. The clear implication of contact with non-human advanced intelligence is, however, that the UFO problem is not just a scientific, but also a politi- cal problem. The sooner we start think- ing about the political impli- cations of an increased rate of various UFO activities, the better off we will be when these rates dramatically in- crease. FOOTNOTES 1.

UFO and creature observed in same area in Pennsylvania By Stan Gordon At approximately 10 p.m. on the night of May 18, 1975, Mr. and Mrs. Philip Arlotta had just stepped into their car, preparing to leave a relative's home in the Gayville section of Greensburg, PA. Mrs. Arlotta had just start- ed the car when she noticed a strange object ahead of them in the sky. She called it to the attention of her husband who told her to shut,- off-_ the .car 'motor,so that they could hear if there was any sound. The object was moving from east to west, and was described as being the apparent size of a .cantaloupe. It was bright yel- low at the point where the ap- parent bottom .section of the oval-shaped object was fromed. Above this area was,a darker section, .giving the impression that .it was actually a part of the object but unlit. Above the dark section, was a row of approximately 6 square windows from which a red light could be seen. After.the couple watched the object for about a minute,-and since they heard no sound, they called their rela- tives to come out. A total of 5 witnesses observed the object as it appeared to move straight toward them at an altitude less then a thousand feet. As it continued on a straight course, it suddenly made an abrupt turn to the left of the witnesses, creating a right angle course. As it made the turn,, the object turned from yellow to orange and began to gain altitude at a rapid pace. The witnesses jumped into the.i r car and proceeded to fol- low the object. .As they con- tinued down a back road they noticed the object, as being very small and orange in color. As they turned onto Route 130 they lost sight of it. All to- gether the object was observed for about 4 minutes. The next evening at about dusk a lone driver was heading home to Jeanette and was taking a short cut just off of Route 130 when something which was moving to his left caught his attention. He stopped his car and pulled back slightly. At a distance of a few hun- dred yards he saw what, at first appeared to be a large German Shepherd dog running on fours. However, the movement was more like that of an ape. After several seconds, the creature stood up on two legs and con- tinued to run like a man into a wooded area.   f The creature was described as being 7 to 8 feet tall, black, and covered with thick hair. The witness said he was a Bigfoot skeptic before, but now he is .a believer. .He said that he always felt that if such a creature did exist it •might be seen in the wooded areas of Canada, but not in this area. What is most Interesting is that the creature sighting and the UFO sighting the night be- fore took place within a i mile of each other. There have not been any creature sightings in this area for over a year.; Is it a coincidence, or are the UFO and creature phenomena somehow tied together?

A recent Bantam paperback by Carl.Sagan, OTHER WORLDS, .might be described as a watered-down version of Sagan's previous: book,- THE COSMIC CONNECTION. If you're familiar with • the author's writings and utterances on space travel, extraterrest- rial life, UFOs, von Daniken, etc., you'll find very little new material, in this book. It does contain a wide variety of. photos, illustrations, cartoons and other items of interest. Of course, when Sagan says such things as \"I don't know:why UFOs are never sighted over large cities by hordes of people\" and \"The reliable (UFO) cases are uninteresting and the interest- ing cases are unreliable,\" one has to wonder about the accuracy of anything else he might say! But, what the heck, it'll prob- ably be good for a few more ap- pearances on the \"Tonight\" show,, If you want the book, it can be ordered from Bantam Books, Inc. 666 Fifth Avenue - N.Y., N.Y 0 10019 for $1.95. ; Anyone who has read my reviews of previous books by John A,, Keel will realize that, to say the least, I do not always agree with Keel's idea's on UFOs. Hav-- ing read his latest book, THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES, I still see no good reason to change my former opinions. I will say, however, that the \"personal nar- rative\" style of writing employ- ed by Keel in this latest book makes for interesting and enter- taining reading. Keel says what he has always said—there are no physical spaceships from the stars; merely \"transmogrificat- ions of energy under the control of some unknown extradimensional intelligence.\" While I would be the last to deny such a possi- bility, it is very difficult for me to reconcile such a view with the TOTAL UFO evidence. But, theories and dissentions aside, I do recommend a wide reading for Keel's latest opus. Primar- ily, . it is the story of his in-' vest!gat ions of Mothman, UFOs, • contactees and \"Men in Black\" in West Virginia during 1966 and '67. It will give you much food for thought.

Denmark photo Through the Danish magazine UFO CONTACT (I GAP JOURNAL), we have learned add!tional detaiIs concerning alleged UFO photos taken by Mr. Jorma Viita in the vicinity of Odense, Denmark, (see SKYLOOK issues of, Novem- ber, 197A; December, 197^; Feb- ruary, 1975; and March, < 1975. The additional information indicates that Mr. Viita has continued to see and photo- graph UFOs—at least 16 times, according to reports which may not be entirely up to date. These photos have indicated many different types of UFOs, including one similar to the famous June 1, 1967, photo from Spain (what appears to be the .letter \"H\" with a cross .mark- ing on the bottom). The photographer i.s 2k years old, from Finland, works, in Odense as a carpenter, became interested .in UFOs -.in,. 1966 after reading Adamski's INSIDE THE SPACE SHIPS, is a subscrib- er to a Finnish UFO magazine, and reportedly is not interest- ed in publicity. He reports that he goes out looking for .UFOs at least once a week, and sometimes two or three times a week. On only one occasion were there other witnesses (June 22, 197*0.. The multiple sightings re- ported will automatically cause some persons in the UFO field to write off these experiences. These reports, like .other unusual reports, should: be studied and analysed. If one photo .can be shown Ito be a fake, then all should be sus- pect. With at least T6 sight- ings and even more individual photos .to work with, a hoax should prove .more difficult. As part of the effort .to learn more about these -sight- ings, we are continuing ef- forts to contact the German and Japanese witnesses to .the June 22, 197 1 *, sighting.

Dr. Joachim P. Kuettner, a former senior scientist at the Air Force Cambridge Research Center, Mass., outlined his startling suggestions on Jan. 20 at a meeting in Pasadena sponsored by the prestigious American Institute of Aeronaut- ics and Astronautics (AIAA). Kuettner is currently work- ing on scientific projects for the World Meteorological Organ- ization, Bracknell, Berkshire, England. Referring to the problem of improving UFO case studies, Kuettner said: \"Many people have discussed various schemes and we have done the same in pur committee (the UFO Com- mittee of the AIAA). \"Most of these schemes... are too costly and require ma- jor support. We have, however, come up with one relatively in- expensive idea... \"If we remember...that about 20 per cent of all unidentified flying object cases are 'close encounters' including landings, the possibility arises to con- firm these reports by actual radar records.\" Kuettner. says that 80 per cent of the U.S. is covered by weather radars that may detect UFOs. \"The National Weather Serv- ice operates approximately 100 weather radars 2k hours a day in the United States to pro- vide information to the various forecasting, warning and clima- tological centers,\" he said. \"Photographs of the...scopes are taken once every hour dur- ing fair weather and once every ^0 seconds during severe weath- er. They are stored at the fa- cility of the Environmental Data Service in Asheville, N.C. \"The radars have range modes of 125 and 250 mile radius... The 250-mile range provides a- bout 65 per cent coverage of the air space volume up to AO.00'0 feet over the entire United States. \"The corresponding figures for the 125-mile range is about 28 per cent.. Overlapping cov- erage would increase the fig- ures to a maximum of 80 per cent.\" Kuettner believes that a complete, search of the radar photographs for anomalous speeds and flight paths indi- cating UFOs would be too ex- pensive. But he does think that the relatively small cost for certain selected studies, in terms of money and effort, would be worthwhile in cases involving close UFO approaches. \"For example,\" he said, \"In the wel1-publicized case of Captain (Larry) Coyne and his helicopter crew a double target may be found.\" (Coyne's heli- copter was reportedly buzzed by a mysterious cigar-shaped ob- ject with a dome at 11 p.m., Oct. 18, 1973. The grey, metal- lie looking object, about 60 feet long, stopped directly over the helicopter, which was returning to Cleveland Hopkins Airport from Columbus, Ohio. The helicopter for unknown reasons suddenly gained nearly 2,000 feet in altitude.) A double target on radar-scope photos would offer tangible confirmation of the helicopter crew's report, and might add additional details about the UFO itself. \"A possible drawback of this approach,\" Kuettner said, \"is the lack of good radar coverage at low levels (where most 'close-encounters' occur) due to the curved earth geometry. Furthermore, best radar cover- age is available during bad weather while the unidentified cases are favored by clear weather, according to available statistics. \"Nevertheless,\" Kuettner concluded, \"the effort is small and inexpensive, and.no major support is required. If it is unsuccessful, nothing is lost, but if it is successful it may add a powerful data piece to specific case studies. This information may already exist but has not been recovered.\" Dr. Kuettner's serious ap- proach to the UFO problem, and his suggestions for improving case data, carry special weight because of his background. From 1958 to 1960 he was director of the Mercury-Reds tone rocket project for the U. S. Army Bal- listic Missile Agency; he work- ed at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in 1960 and 1961, and was a deputy director of Saturn-Apollo rocket systems, 1962-1965;. he was chief space scientist of the National En- vironmental Satellite Center, Wash., D.C., 1965-1967; and in 1967 he became director of Ad- vanced Research Projects for the National Oceanic and At- mospheric Administration.

Page 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Recapping and commenting By Richard Hall (This column is directed to- wards articles appearing in the April, 1974, edition of SKY- LOOK) . Many of the UFO reports in this issue include recurring features worthy of some special research. Are there MUFON mem- bers who would be willing to compile chronologies of them as an aid to research? The features include electromagnetic effects on aircraft, UFOs emitting light beams, UFOs with colored body lights (not patterned), UFOs with secondary objects (\"satel- lite objects,\" usually smaller than the main object). Of special interest is the April 6, 1974, Los Altos, Cali- fornia cylindrical object caus- ing turbulence in surrounding fog, emitting \"lightning-like reflections,\" and moving with erratic bursts of speed before departing upwards at a sharp angle. This report has much in common with Vat lee's Type II (\"Cloud Cigar\") as described in CHALLENGE TO SCIENCE (p. 34, 54- 55). There a 1964 case is re- ported in which the UFO was \"al- most boiling out\" wisps of smoke, emitting a flash of light, and abruptly darting for- ward at one point. In THE TRUTH ABOUT FLYING SAUCERS (p. 146-151), Aime Michel reports the October 17 & 27, 1952, \"cloud cigars\" with satellite objects observed over Oloron and Gail lac, France, In- cluding falls of \"angel's hair.\" The secondary objects displayed what appeared to be electric arc flashes between pairs and moved with bursts of speed in zig- zags. In both cases the larger UFOs were cylindrical (as op- posed to elliptical or spindle- shaped). A sketch of the phe- nomenon appears opposite page 194 (Figure 27) and makes an Page 20 interesting comparison to the sketch in SKYLOOK. Michel's FLTING SAUCERS AND THE STRAIGHT-LINE MYSTERY con- tains a number of references to \"cloud cigars\"—a loosely ap- plied designation since the UFOs are sometimes spherical or disc- like. However, the elongated UFOs (cylindrical or spindle- shaped) with associated turbu- lence, clouds or wisps of smoke, sometimes a rumbling sound, and often accompanied by smaller ob- jects, constitute a body of re- ports with a strong family re- semblance. Not to be overlooked is the similarity to tornado phenomena (turbulent clouds, rumbling, luminous phenomena). -.In STRANGE PHENOMENA, William Corliss re- prints an account from SCIENCE Sept. 9, 1f66» of a tornado with \"electric blue 1ight\" (of, vio- let-blue light in French UFO cases), -balls of 1 i r ght emanating from t.he cone of the tornado, etc. \"The lights darting around in the clouds were sort of lum- inous and appeared to be more round in shape than anything else...they were above a dense layer of clouds, and bluish white in col or...they were shooting around.\" (Corliss GLD- 015)o Weather Bureau data for April 6, 1974, around Los Altos, CAIi- fornia, would be particularly valuable for analyzing that UFO case.
