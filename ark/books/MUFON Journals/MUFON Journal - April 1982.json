FROM THE EDITOR Reports of humans allegedly abducted by UFO beings continue to multiply, and the search for an answer — or answers — is reaching out in many directions. We will continue to explore all aspects of this perplexing problem. In this issue are two articles taking polar opposite positions, one based on the premise that abductions are psychological- ly — but not physically — real events, and the other on the premise that they nre physically real events. One implies mental manipulation of humans by their own subconscious minds, and the other implies alien mental manipulators. We look forward to additional dialogue about these and other hypotheses.

Lawson, a longtime UFO investigator in southern California, has advanced a startling hypothesis — that those \"abduction\" stories people tell under hypnosis primarily reflect not something in the objective reality, but rather the long-suppressed memory of birth and pre-natal ex- periences. He suggests that most of the details common to stories produced under hypnosis of being \"abducted\" onto a UFO actually have close counterparts in the birth process — the long tunnel leading in, the huge interior of the UFO, the often-painful physical ex- amination by \"entities\" who are garbed similarly to hospital person- nel, and the \"levitation\" through the air. 1 Lawson's theory is bound to make an impact: First, it questions what many observers consider the weakest aspect of the commonly-advanced UFO lore — the use of the dubious technique of hypnosis, and the exotic stories peo- ple tell while hypnotized. Second, it is testable — it's not \"just another wild idea\" incapable of proof or disproof. Lawson has conducted some significant tests of the theory, and is open to other ways of checking it further. Third, it conforms to the standard of the basic rule of the philosophy of science called Occam's Razor or the Principle of Parsimony — the pref- erence for the simple direct explana- tion over the complex. The theory thus opens the way to a more rigorous approach to other aspects of the UFO phenomenon as well. Let me describe Lawson's hypoth- esis in a somewhat dra/natized way that 1 think demonstrates its sheer power. For most of us, if not virtually all of us, the most frightening event that ever happened to us was being born. Here we are in the security of this nice comfortable place, the only place we have ever known. Although re- cent research indicates that we are aware in the womb of far more than was previously thought, and that we are effected by such matters as strange foods our mother eats and even the fears and doubts she may have about bearing a baby, we never- theless presumably do enjoy the security of being in our own place, of having all our needs supplied, and even of enjoying the sounds and feel- ings we become aware of. Suddenly all hell breaks loose. We begin to move — to move, of all things! — to move involuntarily out of our place. We are propelled and pushed and pulled and shoved and squeezed and slithered through a long dark tunnel. Not only is the move- ment unexpected and beyond our control, but how could there be any place other than the only place we've ever known? The most terrifying things are yet to come. When we reach the other end of the tunnel, we emerge abrupt- ly into a scary place: a huge room, hundreds of times bigger than the only place we have known. It's prob- ably searingly illuminated, with harsh bright lights assaulting our eyes that had known only dimness and dark- ness. And the \"entities.\" They are usually dressed in plain white ap- parently seamless garments that cover practically everything, even the bot- tom half of their faces, so that large eyes appear to be peering out at us. One of these entities — usually the biggest one, with the deep voice — roughly grabs us, lifts us sharply up- ward, holds us upside down, and delivers a hard and painful slap on our back. We let out a yowl and begin another strange experience — breath- ing. But breathing is \"natural\" and our body has been preparing for it, so that might not be as upsetting as the rest. Now the big entity examines us close- ly — if we were able to hear and understand, we might pick up his mumbling . . . \"Let me see . . . two eyes, two ears, ten fingers, ten toes . . . well, this one seems okay.\" He jabs and pokes at our body a few more times before he's satisfied. The other entities are probably not quite so rough with us — one of them cleans the goo off our body and does a few other things we don't under- stand. Finally we are turned over to a different entity, but this one turns out to feel and act and sound like the place we used to be. After a while, we are securely bundled and* set down to get some sleep. This whole scary, frightening, shocking experience is simply too much for us to cope with at the age of 5 minutes. Since we have no ex- perience to relate it to, we repress the event and its terror, somewhere down there in the \"bottom of our brain.\" Now, it's 20 years, or 30 years, or 40 years later, and we've just had some sort of UFO experience, per- haps a close encounter in which something (it might be a meteor or some strange meteorological or elec- tromagnetic effect) swooshes very near to us, and the shock renders us unconscious, or \"blacked out,\" or into some unusual state of consciousness, for anywhere from a few minutes to several hours. What happened during this \"lost time\"? A UFO investigator suggests regressive hypnosis. A good hypnotist, of course, is careful not to lead the subject on, not to suggest material to someone already in a highly suggestible state. But the mere fact of being hypno- tized, of expecting to be regressed to the time of your blackout, is sugges- tion enough. And when the hypnotist (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Birth Trauma, Continued relaxes us and gets down there where this birth trauma has been languishing repressed all those years and asks us to tell about that UFO we saw, we create a story combining the material there with what we know about UFOs, presumably in a manner sim- ilar to the way we create dreams in our sleep every night. We are taken, we say, through a long tunnel, and on board a UFO. It turns out to be huge, much larger than the few square feet or so that the UFO had appeared to be. The interior is brightly illuminated. There are \"en- tities\" with large heads and eyes, dressed in plain usually seamless clothing, who \"levitate\" us onto a table and proceed to examine our body. Such, basically, is the scenario of the typical hypnotic regression. Lawson suggests that these \"abduc- tion\" stories are actually our elabora- tion of the long-suppressed frighten- ing event of birth. Read the descrip- tion of almost any \"abduction\" and you'll usually find factors such as loss of control, bright light, levitation, a tube or tunnel, a vast room, a physical examination — all \"events\" that can easily be memories of birth ex- perience. Look also at the drawings that hypnotic subjects produce, such as the one on page 52 of The An- dreasson Affair* and at figure 5 in the appendix of The Tujunga Canyon Con- lack. 3 Virtually any such book with drawings will provide examples. I have tried to describe the birth trauma hypothesis in terms of the \"perceptual reality\" of the being-born baby and of our adult \"unconscious.\" Lawson, as befits a college professor, has written his hypothesis in proper academic scholarly form. From his background of teaching English literature, he has traced archetypes and images which appear in many forms — in literature, in dreams, in UFO reports. 4 In fact, his hypothesis goes further than my explication of it: he suggests that the fetus becomes aware of its own shape and form, and he believes that much of the imagery used by hypnotized UFO subjects relates to earlier experiences in the womb. Lawson suggests, for example, that the common \"abduction\" report of doors which appear suddenly and disappear immediately afterward are related to the opening of the cervix in the birth process; that the placenta may emerge in UFO narratives as the shape of a UFO craft and also as a backpack worn by \"entities\": that the \"entities\" seen appear to be \"typically fetal humanoids.\" He draws support from the exten- sive work of psychiatrist Stanislav Grof who has found over many years that patients treated with LSD often report \"reliving their own birth trauma\" during sessions with LSD. Lawson argues that the UFO \"abduc- tion\" is similarly essentially a mental rather than an actual physical ex- perience. \"Abductees tell the truth as they have experienced it,\" Lawson believes, \"although actual events are something else again.\" He considers \"abductions\" to be \"real\" in the sense of having \"psychological validity\" for the hypnotized subject. Lawson co-conducted a test a few years ago in which eight volunteers were hypnotized and asked to come up with a story about being abducted onto a UFO. In analyzing the stories, he found them significantly similar to stories told under hypnosis by people who had a UFO experience, sug- gesting that both the \"real\" and \"im- aginary\" stories might have a com- mon source. 5 A more recent Lawson study on imaginary abductions involved eight people whose births were by cesarean section. He found that seven of the eight used no tube or tunnel imagery in describing how they got on or off the UFO. It turned out that the eighth cesarean subject, whose story did in- clude some tube/tunnel imagery (such as those found in people with normal births), had spent an hour in the birth canal before her mother hemorrhaged and the doctor changed to the cesarean method. 6 (The next article will discuss the reactions, both of agreement and of objections, to Lawson's hypothesis, and will explore the im- plications of the theory for the UFO move- ment.) NOTICE TO STATE DIRECTORS UFO sighting reports submitted on standard sighting report forms to MUFON headquarters by Field In- vestigators and other members of the State teams all are filed, entered into computer data banks, referred to MUFON consultants as appropriate, and otherwise become a useful part of the growing mountain of information about UFOs. The Journal, however, does not always have sufficient staff to convert these reports into manu- scripts suitable for publication to keep members/subscribers informed. For any report that you feel war- rants publication in the Journal, please submit along with the report forms a narrative summary of the case (typed, double-spaced) including the standard journalistic information: Who, What, Where, When . . . and any prelim- inary evaluations or analyses. Photo- graphs or original artwork (not Xerographic copies) will help us to report the story in the most infor- mative, accurate, and professional manner. We suggest that each State organ- ization utilize the services of an ex- perienced writer or editor to expedite the publication of interesting and potentially significant UFO cases so that our readers will be kept informed on a current basis. The present situa- tion is that we receive masses of raw information not in a form suitable for publication. We need the help of reporters willing and able to submit the information in manuscript form. REFERENCES 1. Alvin H.

By Diane Tessman (MUFON State Section Director, St. Petersburg, Florida) Supposing that abductions of humans by UFO occupants are real physical experiences, we can hypoth- esize that either the potential ab- ductee is chosen totally at random because he or she is in a vulnerable position (dark road, etc.), or that he or she is led into that vulnerable position on the dark road by being singled out beforehand, possibly through telep- athy. The usual assumption is that the \"victim\" is chosen at random, but if not, the implications are formidable. It may be that someone driving along is \"zapped\" at random by a passing UFO, subjected to a medical exam, and \"haunted\" by the experience thereafter. However, we can never be sure that the person who has been ab- ducted truly feels \"communication\" with the UFO occupants after the ex- perience, or if he or she merely is traumatized, much as a rape victim feels that the attacker might return at a later date. It is quite another thing to suppose that a man is sitting in the comfort of his home watching the Tonight Show, and suddenly is mentally manipu- lated, somehow, to drive to the edge of the desert ostensibly to observe a meteor shower. This is how Charles Moody's abduction reportedly hap- pened. True, he had planned to watch the meteor shower since reading of it in the newspaper: perhaps the idea grew on him during the day. Perhaps he is an avid star gazer, but from per- sonal experience 1 know how often I have planned — and looked forward — to viewing meteor showers, only to be defeated by sleepiness or the comfort of my home when the time came. The theory of pre-abduction mental manipulation has not been explored extensively. In re-examining abduc- tion cases, I find that some could sup- port this theory while others seeming- ly do not. The following are some of the cases suggesting \"pre-ordained\" abduction encounters: According to Interrupted Journey (John Fuller, Dial Press, 1966), Barney Hill's 120 mile round trip to and from work each night was contributing to the aggravation of his ulcer condition. Yet, as he drove to work on the eve- ning of Sept. 14, 1961, the idea came to him that he and Betty should take an unscheduled week's vacation via car. The idea \"grew on him\" all that night at work, and though he and Bet- ty had no budget money allotted for it (and ran out of cash on the return trip), they both eagerly decided to go. Is it grasping at straws to suggest that this idea was \"planted\" in Barney's mind, thus setting up the best known abduction in modern UFO history? It seems illogical for a man whose health is threatened at least partially because of long daily drives to find the idea of a week of driving irresistibly wonderful. Fuller calls September in the White Moun- tains one of the \"crudest months\"; certainly it was an unpopular time to doggedly head into those mountains for a \"bus driver's vacation.\" In the movie \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind,\" the little boy seemed driven to find the UFOs (and oc- cupants) after UFOs had apparently passed over his home and caused his electrical and battery-operated toys to go berserk. This pre-abduction con- tact has no clear precedent in real-life abduction cases. However, the recent mother and child abduction case in Texas (Journal No. 167, January 1982) includes a somewhat similar ex- perience. The 18-month-old baby seems determined to \"go home\" and keeps this message coming from 7:00 p.m. to midnight, apparently refusing to go to sleep. The mother finally gives up and in an obviously dishev- eled state, starts for home. The baby was ill, and children can be very insis- tent and inconsistent when ill, but there may be another reason for her dogged insistence. Consider the possibility that when the baby pointed to her ear or ex- pressed discomfort there, that it was a \"message\" or mental manipulation perceived within her ear/head. This could also explain why the \"earache\" cleared up so fast after the abduction. The possibility does seem to exist that the child was used . . . driven ... to set up the vulnerable position for the abduction: the perennial dark, deserted road. In Abducted! (Coral and Jim Lorenzen, Berkley, 1977) is the ab- duction story of two young men who decided to take a short-cut on a rural blacktop road. They failed to notice that it was a dead-end road and pro- ceeded to wreck their car as they bumped into the embankment. Again, this may fall within \"normal\" teenage behavior, but it may also be an example of telepathic or' other mental manipulation leading the boys onto a deserted road. The boys also found two houses unresponsive to their knocks, a slightly odd coin- cidence in a rural area. Were both families away that night, or were they not \"supposed\" to come to the door, thus assuring that the boys would be in an isolated, vulnerable position? In the same reference is the Maine case of three young men who decide to take a drive for \"something to do.\" Their van \"turned itself\" down a side road to the lake when they had decid- ed to take a more traveled route; there the abduction ensued. To pur- sue the pre-arrangement hypothesis, at what point were the night's ac- tivities taken over by UFO oc- cupants? When the van \"turned itself\" (a thought willed into the driver's mind?) or when the suggestion to (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"TYPICAL 1981 UFO REPORTS By Richard Hall MUFON investigators in the field have contributed a steady flow of \"typical\" UFO reports, including structured objects with body lights, light beams, electromagnetic effects, humming sounds, and an almost ar- chetypal DD (Daylight Disc). These patterns have held up for at least 35 years, providing the repetitiveness that scientists require for recognizing a \"real\" phenomenon. Why, then (we ask rhetorically), are UFOs still viewed by the majority of scientists as only a popular madness? MUFON investigator Mrs. Jean Fuller, State Section Director for Smith County, interviewed Mr. Jackie Dale Spurlock, 29, an employee of the Southwestern Elec- tric Power Company, who had the following experience between 9:20 and 9:30 p.m., November 24, 1981 near Marshall, Texas: \"My date and I were traveling down an oil road approaching Texas Highway 43 when we noticed an ob- ject with a red pulsating light which was flying just above the trees from our left to our right. I first thought, it was a plane, but then it turned and started straight toward us, and I then noticed two searchlights on the front. We stopped in a curve and waited un- til the object arrived. It stopped and hovered just above the trees. We had to look almost directly up to see it. Then it tilted and put its beams on the truck's cab. (See sketch.) \"We sat there for a short while looking at it and discussing its ap- pearance. I then became afraid and left in a hurry. We traveled about 60-70 yards, not being able to see it. I then realized that we could not see it because it was directly overhead. I then stopped again, and it came from overhead to my side, keeping its lights on us. I then turned and went onto the highway. \"We traveled down the highway watching it as it left the scene of our encounter. After it had traveled some distance, it made an abrupt 90° turn to the right. About 6-7 miles down the highway it crossed our path about 300-400 yards ahead of us. We pulled over on the shoulder, watching it as it went out of sight. It was still in our sight when we left (sic).\" Next day Spurlock had trouble with the truck's alternator, and when he had it checked, they had to replace both the alternator and the battery. Mr. and Mrs. Jan Paag of Pollock Pines, Calif., (El Dorado County) were sleeping outdoors on the early morning of September 6, 1981, when their dog began barking and running (continued on next page) Pre-Arranged?, Continued drive to the lake occurred back in the house trailer? Other cases which might merit a second look with the Pre- Arrangement Theory in mind include the three Kentucky women (\"Ken- tucky Abduction,\" Endydopedia of UFOs, Doubleday, 1980); the Carl Higdon case (\"Higdon Experience,\" same reference) and other cases in- volving hunters; and the Pascagoula, Miss., fishermen case (\"Pascagoula, Mississippi, abduction,\" same reference). The possibility of being mentally manipulated while sitting at home is disturbing not only because there is a sense of personal violation, but also — more importantly — because it opens up the possibility of manipula- tion throughout the history of humankind, a' line of thinking guaranteed to alienate all one's sane colleagues. The possibility that some abduc- tions are pre-arranged also leads to the unpopular thought that at least some abductees are the \"chosen few.\" This is a justifiably unpopular idea since the Adamski's of the world have made the notion of \"star people\" ob- noxious to -serious UFOlogists, and such contactees have profiteered. However, the idea of UFO occupants manipulating some people into an ultimate contact should not be tossed out merely because it implies some special relationship. Also rearing its ugly head in this thinking is that the abduction ex- perience is not the ultimate, and that \"they\" will come back to their contact when the world blows up (or when- ever). This may be egocentric think- ing on the abductee's part. More like- ly, a telepathically adept \"galactic scientist\" for his own mysterious (to us) purposes finds it convenient to pick out a \"victim\" sitting in his home, manipulate him to go to a vulnerable location, swoop down on the hapless victim's car, taking him for the \"re- quired\" medical exam, and leaving him to ponder the significance of it all. Human nature being what it is, perhaps Barney Hill really thought he'd love to spend a week driving, and perhaps the teenagers really couldn't read a map well enough to spot a dead end. What difference does it make? If there are pre-arranged abductions, we could better realize what we are dealing with, the extent of the calculated experiments on humanity, and the power of the telepathic influence. We may be making a mistake in assuming that abduction experiences begin when the abductee \". . . hap- pened to be driving late one night . . .\" Let's remember that the abduc- tion caper may be planned long before the actual contact on the dark, deserted road. (The author would be interested in hearing from abductees, or investigators who know them, as to their feelings about whether they were led into the experience, and whether earlier experiences in their lives may relate to the abduction.)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MEMORIES OF A LOOKOUT: UFOs ON THE YAKIMA INDIAN RESERVATION By Gregory Long 1981 by Gregory Long) Larry George has never forgotten his UFO experiences. A 43-year-old Yakima artist, writer, and educator, George has only recently described what he saw from 1957 to 1961 and in 1964. \"After awhile you get kind of anti- social about the whole thing,\" he told me. \"People brand you as a kook.\" But the UFOs he witnessed as a fire lookout on the Yakima Indian Reser- vation are as real \"as if they happened yesterday,\" and no one will ever con- vince him he was \"seeing things.\" The Reservation, nearly 1.5 million acres, lies within the lower Yakima Valley in south-central Washington State. To the north and west of the Reservation, the snowcapped peaks of Mt. Rainier and Mt. Adams tower into the skies. The lesser ridges of the Cascade Mountains, heavily timbered and marked by high alpine lakes and streams, fill the western region of the Indian lands. Here several lookout sta- tions are situated on high peaks. About 5 miles east of the timberline and in the center of the Reservation is 4,180-foot-high Satus Peak. It was here in the fall of 1961 that Larry George and his wife had a daytime sighting of UFOs. George first noticed the objects when a bright flash, like \"a flash bulb of a camera going off,\" caught his at- tention. He reasoned that a Cessna was about to crash, grabbed his bin- oculars, and looked between Simon Butte and McKay's Butte, about 8 to 12 miles south-southwest of the lookout station. Later he would wonder what had caused the flash since the objects he saw were like \"dull stainless steel\" and never flashed again during the entire sighting. The objects, either five or seven in number, were in formation and flying effortlessly at treetop level above the contours of the earth. Shaped like teardrops with black spots on their sides or near their ends, the objects never left formation. The front three objects were closer together than the others in the upper leg of the forma- tion, and during the entire flight, the 'objects never broke distance. George was puzzled when the ob- jects went over a butte since he ex- pected to see them change shape, revealing either their tops or bottoms as they maneuvered over the land- scape. Yet their size and shape never altered, and they continued to hug the ground, moving at over 300 m.p.h., until George and his wife lost sight of them over the Goldendale Highway (U.S. 97) in the southeast. George and his wife shared the binoculars during the sighting, and even fought over them in their excite- ir»ent, thus the inexactitude in the (continued on next page) 1981 Reports, Continued around the yard. Mrs. Paag did not awaken, but Mr. Paag did and im- mediately saw a large, cigar-shaped orange glowing object speckled with numerous round, red, steady lights coming toward him from the north- west over the large pine trees. It ap- peared to be about 200 yards away and about the size of a DC-10 minus the wings, moving very slowly (estimated 10 m.p.h.) and emitting a humming sound. The UFO continued on a straight course and disappeared to the southeast in about 30 seconds. Mr. Paag is a motel manager, a native of Sweden and a former art dealer, who has flown in all kinds of aircraft. He was a UFO skeptic until this experience. He felt that the object was so unusual that he should report it to someone, so he called the Coun- ty Sheriff's office in Placerville. After several referrals, the report was sent to MUFON and Mr. Paag was inter- viewed for MUFON by Charles D. Marshall, Texas, UFO November 24, 1981 Baer who lives in the same town. MUFON Investigator John E. Zeller, Portland, Oregon, was alerted by the Seattle UFO Reporting Center on July 22, 1981 about the sighting that afternoon of a silver, disc-shaped object at a location about 2 miles from his home. He immediately tele- phoned the witness, Mrs. J.G. (who prefers to remain anonymous) and ar- ranged for an interview the following day. Mrs. G. was in the master bedroom at 3:20 p.m. talking on the phone to her daughter in Texas, when her son called \"Mom, look at the UFO!\" She looked out to the north and saw a silvery disc nearby, about to pass over the house. She ran out on the deck facing south, joining another daughter who had been sunbathing, a visiting niece, and her son, to observe the object. The disc came over the crest of a hill at treetop level, and was now visi- ble about 150 feet to the east of the house and at about 150 feet altitude. It was a bright, shiny (like tinfoil) ob- ject similar to two saucers joined at their edges. It did not rotate, flutter, or wobble, but made a smooth turn to the left (southeast), cleared two tall fir trees, turned to the south, and ap- peared to settle down in the trees and brush about a quarter of a mile away in an undeveloped area. Local teen- agers went down the brush- and tree- covered slope, but were unable to find any thing. D"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Lookout, Continued number of objects and the location of the black spots. But George is positive that he saw unknown craft perform- ing near-impossible feats. Days later he spotted an F-105 that passed the lookout station at ground level. The jet was traveling \"off the deck.\" , \"Anybody would be crazy flying off the deck that fast,\" George marveled. And yet that was what the UFOs had done, never breaking rank and traveling in total silence. This was George's only daytime sighting of strange objects on the Reservation. Years later, in the sum- mer of 1972 at 2:30'a.m., WJ. (Bill) Vogel,, the chief fire control officer on the Reservation, would see a tear- drop-shaped light east of the Golden- dale Highway. (Now retired, Vogel continues to investigate reports of UFO sightings on the Reservation.) The bright, fluorescent orange object, displaying a \"mouse tail\" of flashing lights on its narrow end, traveled south across the Reservation and eventually vanished in the distance. Was this nocturnal light related to George's sighting of teardrop-shaped daylight discs? George doesn't know, but he is ab- solutely sure that \"they were really craft, they were flying. Whether they were spacecraft, I don't know. But we saw them, and nothing on this earth can tell me I didn't see them.\" By George's accounting, he saw a large number of nighttime UFOs while a lookout. After awhile, sightings became so commonplace that he lost count. Yet he cautions that the isolation of a lookout's job (his wife did not always accompany him), and the unbroken days of solitude and quiet, can lead to mental and visual quirks. \"No one,calls on the radio. It's like you're not alive, you're all by yourself in the middle of nowhere. Your eyes and imagination play tricks on you. You start seeing things or hearing things, maybe what- ever your mind wants you to see.\" But the position, color, and behavior of the nocturnal lights he saw made the difference between misperceived objects, fabricated events, and the \"real\" thing. Most Artist's Rendition of Fall 1961 Daylight Discs Drawn by Larry George often the lights were orange, blue, or white and traveled west to east, north to south, and south to north. Some displayed a wobble or wavering mo- tion during their passage, or acted strangely in other ways. As an example, while on duty at Simcoe Butte Lookout on the south- ern edge of the Reservation in 1957 (the lookout station has since been moved about 5 miles east along the ridge and renamed Sopelia Lookout), George was puzzled that two Venuses should be in the sky, the sec- ond planet the same magnitude as its companion. Suddenly one of the \"planets\" moved as a steady light and swooped down into a canyon two or three miles distant and went out like \"putting out a light.\" Beginning in the summer of 1958, George's duty station was changed to Satus Peak Lookout where he served for three fire seasons. He would return to this station in 1964 after three years in the Army at White Sands Proving Grounds. One night (he is uncertain of the year), George saw what appeared to be a green flare go up into the sky near Signal Peak Lookout 20 miles to the west. He took an azimuth reading. How could a flare go up an estimated 4,000 feet and why? He called Signal Peak. \"Nobody's shooting flares,\" he was told. \"Where did you see a flare!\" As far as George knew, nobody cared that he saw the object or (ex- cept for himself) ever reported seeing it. A few other times he saw red or green flares go up late at night on the Reservation, each time winking out before they \"hit\" the ground. George is uncertain whether or not lookouts at the other three Reserva- tion stations reported UFO sightings among themselves during these years. The lookouts seemed to be geograph- ically divided from each other (al- though Vogel, as chief fire control officer, oversaw both groups). The Signal Peak, Simcoe (Sopelia), and Grayback Lookout stations were in- volved with Forestry firefighters and timber fires, and the Satus Peak sta- tion concentrated on fires in the brushlands...George, at least, rarely met any of the other lookouts and never thought about passing on infor- mation of sightings to them — except in the case of the \"flares,\" which posed an obvious fire hazard. And of course there was the threat of ridi : cule. Until 1972, Vogel, long a skep- tic, responded to George's reports of objects with a grain of salt. However, in 1959 or 1960 at 1:30 in the morning, George was awak- ened by a phone call from Signal Peak Lookout. George recalled that the night was extremely clear and the moon was out. Signal Peak was prom- inent above the forest. The female lookout on the line had opened the door to go outside to the outhouse when she saw a light and refused to go any further. 'There's this purple light coming from the sky, and it's right outside above my house here. Can you see it?\" George recalled, \"And I look out there, and there's nothing..There's no light, nothing.\" The lookout insisted, \"It's a very (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Lookout, Continued bright, purple light coming out of the sky, and it's making a sound.\" \"\\ don't see anything! I'm looking right at you! 1 can't see it. There's nothing . . . nothing.\" Subsequently, the light apparently went out. In 1964 George did see something, although the object passed the Satus Peak Lookout at such a speed that he never got a good look at it. However, his wife did. George rarely turned the lights on in the cabin at night since everything would be reflected in the glass windows. Instead, he used a red- painted flashlight to look at the fire- finder. This night, he was standing facing the east window. His wife was standing facing north. Suddenly (as his wife told him later) an aqua-blue object four to five times brighter than a neon sign and prob- ably no bigger than the circle of a flashlight came out of the north from the direction of Ahtanum Ridge at tremendous speed and headed straight for the lookout station. She screamed. Before George could turn, he wit- nessed a long, blue streak of light like a laser beam reflected in the east win- dow as the object tore by the west window, narrowly missing the sta-. tion. . On another night, a \"big, giant\" white light appeared over the town of Toppenish at approximately 3,000 feet, stopped and hovered, and then traveled north to Wapato, where it stopped, hovered, and then traveled on to Yakima where it dwindled in brightness in the north until it was in- distinguishable from the stars. Other events occurred during these years, although their relationship to UFOs in unknown. At 1:00 a.m. in 1961 at the Satus Peak station, George was pumping up the gas lamp after he and his wife had returned from a brief trip to Toppenish. Without warning, his wife shrieked. He seized his rifle. \"I saw a hairy face looking through the window!\" she cried. George was skeptical. The distance from the window to the ground was 8 to 10 feet. \"It could have been her imagination,\" George admitted. But what about the sound of a baby crying that his wife insisted time and again she heard outside the station? The wind? A cougar? There were cer- tainly no humans around for miles and miles. And George had never heard the sound — until one day. \"A baby crying is a baby crying!\" he told me in exasperation. Many times he walked down the hill look- ing for the baby crying that he never found. Could this have been Bigfoot, an oversized, hirsute, manlike creature, who apparently makes similar sounds and who, along' with the UFOs, has purportedly been sighted periodically on the Reservation? At other times George would spot fires, but once firefighters arrived, no fires could be found. He remembered an incident in which he saw \"a big fire as plain as day\" at the southeastern boundary of the Reservation near the wheatfields of the Horse Heaven Hills. The fire was so prominent that he did not \"shoot\" the azimuth and directed a helicopter to it by radio. Yet when the helicopter arrived at the site, the occupants saw nothing. \"You're seeing things!\" they said. Were these experiences the result of the long, empty hours of loneliness and isolation on the mountaintops? George told.me that he could hear the sound of a car miles away, that he would become leery of anything out of place on the land. One day he mistook 50 geese in the sky for strange \"objects\" hovering at several 'thousand feet until he studied them through binoculars and realized that geese don't always fly hundreds of feet above the earth as commonly ex- .pected. He confessed that it was dif- ficult to judge the distance and size of objects at night without the backdrop of reference points at eye level or below him. Any lights he saw above him were unrelated to anything else but themselves. Yet George is familiar with the ap- pearance of satellites, the flight pat- terns and lights of aircraft, and the antics of weather balloons. Addi- tionally, as a technical illustrator in the Army, George became familiar with all kinds of military aircraft and was soon knowledgeable of America's arsenal and that of foreign countries. However, despite his conviction that the objects he saw performed non- conventionally and had to be UFOs, he kept his experiences .to himself, and if he spoke of them, did so only casually.. Significantly, George's ex- periences predate Vogel's own sighting by more than 10 years, and by George's account, the other look- outs were generally unaware of his (George's) sightings. He admitted to me that I was the first person with any authority that he had actually, talked to in detail about his ex- periences. Since George is knowledgeable about .Indian legend and myth, I asked him if .UFOs on the Reservation have had an Indian \"connection,\" an intimate relationship with the people who lived on this land for thousands of years? George doesn't think so although prophecies were made by the local Indians in the early 1800's that \"flying objects\" would be seen in the \"near future\" as they had been seen in the past. George recounted a story that he had heard from his mother of a \"fly- ing machine\" observed in the late 1920's or 1930's by an old Indian man on the Reservation. Supposedly, the silent object hovered over Fish Lake (an area today that can be reached only by four-wheel drive vehicle), went across it, and then entered the lake and came out. The old man told listeners that \"It wasn't his time to die,\" implying that since the object safely left the lake, the life of, its occu- pant was spared. George has no theories about what UFOs are or where they come from. \"I think there.are some people who are looking for the answer, but I don't think they are any closer to it than I am right now.\" But he remains in- trigued by sighting reports. .\"Maybe that's why I continue to look up,\" he says. And just in case, he regularly packs a camera with him. Even though Larry George grants the possibility that \"your eyes and im- agination play tricks on you\" in the unique environment of the lookout (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"\"ROARING\" UFO OVER VIRGINIA By Bob Grattan (MUFON Investigator) SIGHTING DATE: Sunday, January 31, 1982 TIME: 21:25 EST LOCATION: Mechanicsville, Va. (Hanover County) WITNESSES: Ann & Steve Walton INTERVIEW DATE: Saturday 2/23/ 82 On the evening of Jan. 31, Steve and Ann were watching a television show when they noticed a very bright light out of their south win- dows on either side of the TV set. Thinking it was an airplane, Steve ran out the rear of the house while Ann ran out the front door. Two very bright lights, much like aircraft land- ing lights except much brighter and closer together (about 2 feet apart) were seen moving from the south up the north/south property line above the trees. The weather was cold and overcast with wind but no rain. The object was estimated to be about 500 feet in altitude and moving around 65-85 m.p.h. (about the speed of a Piper Cub plane). Walton said that an ob- ject of that size could not have been flying so slow without crashing. It was silent on approach but emitted an extremely loud roar as it passed, much louder than a Phantom F4 jet taking off. Lights, both amber and blue, were noted as described in the report form. The body was a dull metallic color. (See sketch.) The ob- ject abruptly ascended into the cloud cover, but the loud sound continued for another 20-30 seconds. The Waltons have a dog and rab- bits, but they were too astonished to notice any possible animal reactions. Lookout, Continued station, he stresses the reality of his single daytime sighting. \"I don't care what anyone says. Something is out there. They can call me a kook, they can call me crazy, anything they'd like. But I saw those things.\" Blue lights Mechanicsville, Va., UFO — January 31, 1982 No loss of electricity or change in TV reception were noted; however, they were both outside as the object passed the house. Steve noted that there was nq odor of aviation fuel or exhaust which was always present around aircraft. Vibration was heavy on the ground and in the house. No time before or after the sighting was unaccounted for as best they could tell. Later that week, a friend of the Waltons, who lives in an apartment complex about 5 miles from them, mentioned in passing that she had ex- perienced a power failure on that night the same time as the sighting; it lasted about 30 minutes. After check- ing with VEPCO (Va. Elec. Power Co.), I was unable to confirm any power loss in the area; anyway, they had none recorded. The Waltons had not mentioned the sighting to the friend. One other neighbor was ques- tioned by the Waltons but this person had retired early that evening and heard nothing. They have hesitated to discuss it with anyone else. Steve phoned the Byrd Airport tower as the airport is several miles south of their home. The tower reported no aircraft in their area at the time of the sighting and after much discussion, gave Steve the UFO hotline number in Washington state. Steve and Ann Walton gave me the impression of extreme sincerity and honesty in the interview, and they ap- peared very interested in finding out what they saw that evening. Neither seemed to know much about UFOs and had not really been interested in them before the sighting. They have now expressed an interest in joining the MUFON group and may have done so by this date. Steve appeared very knowledgeable about different types of aircraft and equipment used on such vehicles. My impression was that they were frightened by what they saw. Steve, a general contractor, served as an aircraft electrician in the Air National Guard for 6 years. I find that there are many similarities be- tween the Walton sighting and the objects reported by William Hassel in \"Multiple Sightings of Triangular UFOs\" (MUFON UFO Journal, Jan. 1982, pp. 9-12). Also, certain similarities are 'present with the tape recording made by Joseph C. Stewart on Michigan sightings last fall. (See separate report.)D 10"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"UFOLOGY IN ITALY Foreign researchers wonder about the lack of UFO reports coming from Italy. To understand the problem, it is necessary to know the tormented story of Italian UFOlogy. This paper will delineate the various stages in the progress of research, and try to clear up the obscure side of Italian UFOlogy. UFOs first received widespread at- tention in Italy during the 1954 wave (not in 1947) when Italian territory was involved directly. Almost 400 reports were gathered in Italy follow- ing the 1954 wave. The first two UFO centers were created in these years: the Centre Indipendente Rac- colta Notizie Osservazioni (CIRNOS), or Independent Center for Gathering News About Space Observations; and the Centre Italiano Studi Avia- zione Elettromagnetica (CISAER), or Italian Center of Research on Elec- tromagnetic Spaceships. CIRNOS lasted not quite 4 years, and collapsed when its founder, E. Michaelles, ceased research. CISAER, led by A. Perego (author of four books between 1957 and 1970), lasted longer and was able to express itself at a higher official level than CIRNOS. Very little research was done, except that CIRNOS did elaborate some statistical documents and some interesting speculations. CISAER, on the other hand, took faithist positions: the UFOs are elec- tromagnetic devices driven by ex- traterrestrials here to.avoid a nuclear war. In the early 1960's some reviews were published, such as \"Spazio e Vita\" (Space and Life) and \"Dischi Volanti\" (Flying Saucers), but they ceased publication after a few issues. The next fundamental stage came in 1963 when \"Clypeus\" was created, a review treating UFOs and various By Massimo Greco* other subjects. Led by G. Settimo, this review (still published today) repre- sented the only light in the dark world of UFO research. Real research still was nonexistent, though there were a few small centers and a lot of \"fans\" (only a few scientifically oriented). Many of the serious re- searchers felt the need to coordinate their forces, so in 1966 at a meeting in Turin, the Centre Ufologica Na- zionale (CUN), or National UFO Center, was formed. CUN's purpose is to unify the forces of investigators, creating some provincial branches and publishing a bulletin, \"Notiziario UFO\" to keep members informed. This remained for years the only review entirely dedicated to the UFO phenomenon, and was published until 1980. Unity of researchers under a center is not easy to achieve, as the foreign centers also have experienced, but CUN con- tinues to this day as the only Italian center whose authoritativeness is recognized on a national scale. In the early 1970's two new reviews were created: \"II Giornale dei Miste'ri\" (Mysteries Journal) and \"Gli Arcani\" (The Mysteries). As can be understood from their names, these reviews treat a wide range of topics, such as parapsychology, astrology, magic, \"astronomy,\" and also UFOs. These reviews, sold in all the newspaper kiosks, contributed to the development of UFO research as a social phenomenon and to the \"research groups\" phenomenon. In those years it was all the fashion to create a research group, and the 1973 wave (remember the Turin-Caselle radar-visual case) contributed to this trend. Obviously, most of the groups in- cluded many pseudoresearchers and closed after a few months, but a study in 1979 indicates that 400 groups then existed in Italy! Unfortunately, their reviews reported dozens of sightings referring to meteors, stars, airplanes, etc., that some of the groups spread as real UFOs. The pic- ture of Italian UFOlogy to that point was distressing. Research Grows Up In 1973 the Comitato Nazionale di Investgazione sui Fenomeni Aerei Anomali (CNIFAA), or National In- vestigation Committee on Anom- alous Aerial Phenomena, was found- ed. This center operates on a scientific basis, led by mssrs. Farabone, Cabassi, and Izzo, but is small and lacks field investigators. Its only noteworthy work is publication of the review \"UFO Phenomena,\" which compiles .articles written by the foremost inter- national UFO researchers. It was awarded a prize by the Fund for UFO Research as a worthwhile scientific UFO review. But the problem of Italian research continued and few contributions were made by Italian UFOlogists. CUN, in the meantime, continued to expand nationally and in 1978 decided to sell \"Notiziaro UFO\" in newspaper kiosks, but this led to at- tempts to popularize the review for a mass audience. After about 2 years, the editor sought permission to in- dulge in \"creative\" reporting, but the Board of Directors firmly opposed that proposal. Then the review was literally blocked by the editor in June 1980. You will notice that I haven't yet spoken of true research in Italy. The reasons are easy to find: In Italy there are few effective researchers and many eagerly interested \"fans,\" so (continued on next page) \"Edited by Richard Hall.

Italy, Continued contributions by Italian researchers were limited to the good will of the few who knew English and could translate the reports. CUN, realizing the problem of research, has totally reorganized and reduced the number of members to those who may be counted on as effective researchers to cover the entire nation. Some members trans- late the most interesting Italian reports into English to keep others in- formed on what occurs in Italy. Each regional branch of CUN is compiling a catalogue of all UFO sightings, past and present, and including IFOs so as to have a complete picture. When this monumental work is completed, it will become a national catalogue that may include as many as 20,000 cases. At last we can begin to speak of effective research. Italian UFOlogists have come to understand that the name of the center or the number of its members is not important, but in- stead the work that it accomplishes. I hope that Italian contributions to in- ternational UFO research will now be more frequent. At least we have taken the first step, the first of a long chain.

This is imperative due to delays of Second Class mailings in the various postal services throughout the world. The address on the cover of the jour- nal for U.S.A. subscribers, and on the envelope for foreign subscribers, con- tains a code date advising when your subscription expires. If your issue has the code M3/82, your subscription ex- pires with the March 1982 issue. Recognizing that some of our foreign subscribers may not receive their copies for one or two months after being mailed, we are inserting a renewal form with the two issues prior to the month of expiration. Each subscriber will also receive a renewal form with a \"red check\" as a final reminder that your subscription ex- pires with this issue. By renewing promptly when you receive the first reminder, your bank check, cash, or postal money order with your renewal form will arrive in Seguin; Texas prior to the time that your actual expiration takes place, thus maintaining your continuity of Journal issues. Do not wait until you receive the \"red check\" before renew- ing, because this requires more expen- sive postal mailings for a subscriber to \"catch-up.\" This policy applies to all subscribers, not just our foreign friends. We have, been using this pro- cedure for several months as pre- viously advised in the Journal. By renewing promptly, your ex- piration date is simply advanced upon receipt of your membership/subscrip- tion dues, thus guaranteeing our members continuity in Journal issues. We do not have a reduction in price by subscribing for several years in ad- vance, however, with inflation and in- creases in the cost of publishing, you are guaranteed that any subsequent subscription increases will not effect you during this period. In effect, this is a savings to the subscriber.

Stewart (State Section Director) A few minutes after 10:00 p.m., Monday, September 14,1981, a large triangle of lights, reported to have a bright orange hue and thought by some to be perhaps as large as the space encompassed by multiple com- mercial jets, was seen crossing the St. Clair River which separates Port Huron, Michigan and Sarnia, On- tario. Later news accounts contained in the UFO Newsclipping Service in- dicate that the same lights/object had been reported over Ontario just prior to the Port Huron observations, mov- ing slowly west toward Sarnia along Route 402. (See especially UFO Newsclipping Service #147, October 1981, page 13, \"Lights in sky prompt calls.\") Residents in Port Huron and subur- ban Marysville stated that the triangle, with a fourth, smaller red light trailing behind on the left side, mov- ed extremely slowly over the city at an indeterminate altitude thought to be a few to several thousand feet. It continued in a generally westerly direction. It should be noted that the subject named in the above news arti- cle specifically mentioned two trailing red lights which were centered at the rear in the fashion of auto taillights. The triangle was next seen near the town of Goodells, which is in western St. Clair County along state highway M-21. A resident there reported that it hovered when first spotted, then changed direction twice before mov- ing farther west. Two sheriff's deputies on patrol in Lapeer County attempted to photo- graph the lights (as had a teenage boy in Marysville) but were likewise un- successful due to inadequate film, set- tings, and exposure time. Through a telephoto lens, one of the officers believed he saw a metallic body amidst the lights, of a dark or dull finish. The officers also reported that the lights changed from bright orange to dull or pale yellow as they watched the object pass overhead. Further, they stated that a single red light was centered directly behind the triangle. Two Flint residents observed the triangle at 10:25-10:30 as it passed over the heart of that city. In the two- minute duration before it was lost behind urban structures, each deter- mined . that the triangle, seen as equilateral with yellow-white hue, once again had a single red light behind and to the left. One of these subjects stated that this fourth light at one point moved from the off-centered position to a position directly behind . the other three. It was last seen behind these two floating over the large Buick plant on the city's west side. A Flint radio station, VVTRX, reported receiving numerous phorie calls to a talk show host as the triangle passed over the city. Unfortunately, no tape recording of that show was retained in order to locate additional observers, and the host could offer only the same basic description reported here. While over Flint, the object was seen and reported by four policemen from three locations. As it moved beyond Bishop Airport and away from the city, it was seen by a woman from the town of Swartz Creek in western Genesee County. It reached the town at approximately 10:45. That witness declared that a full 20 minutes transpired for that 17-mile segment.' The basic characteristics, then, are • of a huge triangle of smallish lights, seen variously as bright orange and pale yellow, with either one or two smaller red lights perhaps indepen- dent of main body. Though the presumed object was depicted as be- ing very low in the sky, no sound was heard and no clear outline seen. Bishop Airport reported nothing unusual on its (transponder type) radar. While numerous inquiries were initiated (including, for example, to Marysville High School where an evening class reportedly viewed the anomaly), few individuals responded in any formal manner, perhaps due to the relatively brief and unspectacular nature of the activity. An early assessment by a CUFOS investigator, Jim Wilson of Owosso who interviewed the four Flint policemen,. indicated that the object was a B-52 on a refueling run with a KC-135 tanker. This was concluded on the basis of a verbal response from the Public Information Office of Wurtsmith AFB in Oscoda,. despite the broken cloud cover at 12,000 feet and a general overcast at 25,000 feet. Correspondence which I received following an FOIA inquiry states that a refueling operation was not con- ducted on the evening of September 14. Spokesmen at Wurtsmith AFB and Selfridge ANG base, Michigan, both stated that there was no such operation. As a final note, tracing the object's path across known points leads one to the conclusion that it may have been following either M-21 itself or railroad tracks which roughly follow the highway. TIMKS-OOLONIST, Victoria, B.C., Canada - Sept. 16, 1981 Lights In sky prompt calls SARNIA, Ont. (CP) — Provincial police reported '•a flood of calls\" from area residents wondering what strange object lit up the skies Monday night. Neither police nor airport spokesmen were able to to satisfy Brian Fader of nearby Camlachie. Fader said he was driving on a country road when he saw lights reflecting off his car window. \"There were three big white lights flying very slowly in a V shape and two smaller lights In the centre that looked sort of like tail lights,\" he said. They moved slowly across the sky toward the city and were \"very, very low to the ground,\" he said. •'They (lights) were so big that, if whatever it was had landed, it would have been bigger than a football field.\" 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE HEADQUARTERS 379TH 3OMEHARDMENT WING (SAC) WURTSMITH AIR FORCE BASE.

It is a dilemma which sets UFO col- league against colleague and threatens, if not dealt with satisfac- torily, to upset our concentrated ef- forts to solve the UFO mystery. To this meeting of objective, though diversified, researchers, one of us brought a close encounter vic- tim, who himself has been invaluable in performing certain types of tech- nical analysis on bits of physical UFO evidence from cases other than his own. Please forgive the generalities in this article. I usually give names and identifying information in these col- umns, but this particular situation must be dealt with as tactfully as possible in order to preserve the ex- cellent working relationships the members of our group have estab- lished with one another over the years. Also, the identity of the CE-III participant must be similarly pro- tected for. several additional reasons. Though the majority of us at the meeting had worked in the past with close encounter witnesses (the terms \"abductee,\" \"victim,\" or the more recently revived term \"contactee\" might be equally applied), a few are either fairly new, though extremely valuable to the field, or, because of the nature of their specialized in- terests, have not been exposed direct- ly to CE-III (IV) witnesses and know *I use this term advisedly, with respect for all those scientists who ac- cept nothing as \"fact\" unless it is ex- perienced by their five physical senses and/or current technology in- strumentation. little of the kinds of damage these persons apparently suffer as the result of very close proximity with UFOs and their occupants. Our witness was asked to describe his 1950s encounter, which he did with appropriate succinctness. After- ward, he proceeded, under question- ing, to explain the dire effects which had befallen him in later years — sud- den surgings into his consciousness in- volving 'alleged knowledge of \"ad- vanced physics,\" harassment by unidentified persons resembling in many respects the more believable \"MIB\" reports, and psychological damage which could be traced, in his own mind at least, directly to the ini- tial encounter. Two of us had worked closely with this particular CE-III witness for many months and had come to appreciate him as a productive, talented human being. We had also developed a cer- tain empathy with him as a troubled person caught up in UFOlogical phenomena, but that did not in any sense take, away our objectivity toward the case. A third member was working closely with him as part of a research project involving physical/ psychological damage to close en- counter victims. Though for the most part the witness was received well and with objective understanding by our group, the meeting was described later by him as \"a disaster.\" He regret- ted having come forward, even as privately as this, for he felt literally deluged by questions, doubts, and a feeling close to prejudicial disbelief. Some of his statements seemed to disturb the more scientifically purist* members of our group. They demanded empirical proof from the witness that he had indeed been given the advanced knowledge of physics from UFO entities, and also demand- ed that he prove his statements con- cerning \"run-ins\" with scientists to whom he was able to offer solutions to complicated questions of physics and nuclear science, as a result of his UFOlogically-derived knowledge. Unfortunately for the witness, the group, and the field itself, this \"knowledge,\" which the witness stated he had been able to write down over a period of weeks, had been destroyed by him several years before. He had come to the conclu- sion, he stated, that the advanced knowledge was a source of grief and that it \"scared\" him, since it was \"10,000 years ahead of our time.\" (This was a phrase he used \"off the top of [his] head\" as he explained later to me. It did not represent a precise time frame.) Therefore, thinking that he could erase its dire effects, he con- signed it to the flames.. \" The witness is technically know- ledgeable and talented in his own field of expertise, but in physics he is not technically qualified to discuss all phases of atomic physics, quantum mechanics, etc. Two or three of our more empirical members were able to \"catch\" him in errors of terminology, in a statement about government policy on secrecy clearances, etc. The specifics of this case are not yet ready to be published even though it has been investigated for more than a year. The reason for stating even the above particulars is to point up the fact that, in the opinion of at least two or three of the scientists and engineers participating in the meeting, the CE-III witness's story (report) was not believable because a few of the details did not, in their opinion, hold up.

Spon- sored by the Mutual UFO Network, Henry H. McKay, Canadian Regional Director, is chairman for the host organization. The 1982 UFO Summit Conference being held in conjunction with the MUFON UFO Symposium is scheduled for Monday, July 5th from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Westbury Hotel. Featured speakers and their speech titles are Dr. J. Allen Hynek, \"Plan- ning for the Next UFO Flap\"; Dr. George and Iris Owen, \"The UFO Phenomenon and Its Relationship to Parapsychological Research\"; David Haisell, \"UFO Research: An Interna- tional Perspective\"; Michael A. Per- singer, Ph.D., \"Predicting UFO Events and Experiences\"; Arthur Bray, \"Professionalism in UFOlogy\"; and William L. Moore, tentative title \"New Disclosures on Crashed Saucers.\" Stanton T. Friedman, previously scheduled to speak, has regretfully had to decline due to new business obligations. John F. Schuessler, Deputy Direc- tor of MUFON, has been scheduled to speak on the exciting \"Cash- Landrum Radiation Case,\" that has received nationwide exposure on the TV programs 'That's Incredible\" and \"Good Morning America.\" The medical aspects of the Cash-Landrum case, as reported in the April 1981 and November 1981 editions of the MUFON UFO Journal, make it one of the most significant UFO cases on record. It has been featured in such Texas newspapers as the Dallas Times- Herald, the Houston Chronicle, and the Corpus Christi Caller-Times. The North American .weekly tabloids, the National Enquirer, and Weekly World News have reported the event, but not the details that Mr. Schuessler will share with those attending the sym- posium in his slide-illustrated speech. Specialized workshops on UFO- related subjects have been scheduled between featured speakers through- out the symposium program, giving the participants an opportunity to at- tend the session that is of the most in- terest to the individual. Two videotaped films will be shown on Saturday and Sunday — \"Strange Harvest\" on cattle mutilations and \"UFOs Are Real,\" a documentary. The Friday evening, July 2nd, pro- gram will consist of registration, displays, a cocktail hour, and a get- acquainted session. Admission prices for each session have not been estab- lished, but will be announced in the near future. There will be a package discount for the entire symposium. Sixty rooms have been reserved at the Westbury Hotel at special group rates of $58.00 per room, per day, single occupancy and $68.00 per room, per day, for double occupancy. Each participant must make his own reservations directly with the hotel. Special reservation cards have been printed by the hotel to be used to identify those attending the 1982 MUFON International UFO Sym- posium, so that you may obtain the group rate and are assigned to one of the rooms blocked for this purpose. We encourage everyone to make your reservations promptly so that you may stay at the Westbury Hotel. Arrangements have been made with a nearby hotel for the overflow, after the Westbury is booked. The Annual MUFON Corporate Meeting is planned for Sunday, July 4th from 9 a.m. to 12 noon. All MUFON members with I.D. cards are invited, to attend. The 1982 MUFON UFO Symposium Proceedings will not only include the presented papers by each of the featured speakers, but also will contain a published paper titled \"A UFO Propulsion Model\" by F.E. Alzofon, PhD. The proceedings will be available at the symposium on July 2, 3, 4 and 5 for $10.00, and by mail thereafter from MUFON for $10.00 plus $1.50 postage and han- dling. Start planning your vacation now to attend this exciting and inspira- tional annual international UFO sym- posium. Late Note The symposium is scheduled for five individual sessions with featured speakers slated for each. Three ses- sions are on the program for Satur : day, July 3rd and two on Sunday, July 4th. The price of admission to each session is $6.00, a special package price for all sessions is $25.00, a sav- ings of $5.00. Advance reservations may be made at this time by specify- ing in writing and enclosing either an International Postal Money Order or a certified check in U.S. funds made payable to United Friends of Ontario, along with a self-addressed envelope for your confirmation.

They find essentially honest, rational witnesses giving coherent ac- counts of incredible events. It is not the \"incredible\" part of these reports which bother us especially, for most CE-III and CE-IV reports, though in- credible, have enough elements in common that they can be accepted, at least, as \"real\" in the witnesses' minds. Logically, if hundreds of essentially reliable and productive human beings feel that entities from apparent ET sources have contacted them, cannot UFO researchers regard these persons as having a rightful part in the UFOlogical scene? Study of, and human empathy with, these individ- uals should not take away anyone's objective desire to document and verify their statements, but the harsh fact is that many of their statements concerning their initial encounters (and subsequent results of such en- counters) are unverifiable. Researchers are able to verify some of the statements, but real proof, that is, empirical evidence, of the root con- tact eludes us. Those of our group who knew the witness well and regarded him as an essentially honest and productive per- son tried to explain that empirical evidence in contactee cases is often difficult to gather and gave our opin- ion that such reports must never- theless be studied, meanwhile treating the witness with humane concern. Our empathy does not denote care- lessness about \"facts,\" but rather it is a recognition that many close en- counter victims have been deeply disturbed by the contacts they sincerely believe are real, and they look to UFO researchers for informa- tion which might provide them with partial answers. Should scientists expect the sea- soned expertise from contactees which they themselves have ac- quired? It seems that empirical scien- tists working in highly specialized fields would like to prove the ex- istence of UFOs within their own fields or at least some other physical science or sciences. The UFO phe- nomenon, however, will not be thus limited. It seems to manifest in all phases of physical being and also in fields of being beyond the reach of conventional science such as parapsy- chology, mind-matter interface, and quantum mechanics. Its \"reality\" can- not be limited to empirical evidence only. We must open our minds and ac- cept the fact that this is a phenom- enon which is deeply affecting wit- nesses in what I am forced to call \"subjective reality.\" Everyone of us, scientist and layman alike, is aware of reality in a slightly different way. Sometimes we cannot convince the other guy that what we sense as \"real- ity\" is actual fact. We must open our minds enough to admit the possibility that an essentially rational CE-III vic- tim is telling us what he believes is \"real\" and treat his statements as \"real,\" at least to him. Therefore, I contend that demands for empirical evidence in some \"con- tactee\" situations is \"impossible, but that should not prevent us from con- tinuing to study those cases if the human being behind the report is rational. We must not forget that some \"hard sciences,\" though claim- ing to be based on empirical evidence, in reality are not exclusively so based. I cite, for example, astronomy, quan- tum physics, anthropology, paleon- tology. We know that astronomy's \"black holes\" and \"neutron stars\" have never been seen or measured. Other \"verified\" sciences, likewise, change almost\" yearly as new discoveries are made. The evidence presented by the more stable CE-III (IV) witnesses has a certain empirical quality about it which cannot be denied. They have been deeply affected by their reported sightings and contacts. Their stories are internally consistent and consistent, in many regards, with hun- dreds of like stories all over the world. What can we do with \"evi- dence\" like this? Ignore it? Or con- tinue to study these reports, accepting the witnesses at face value while at- tempting to evaluate, as best we can, each facet of their UFOlogical in- volvement? I opt for the latter. UFOs are a human problem in that they are deeply affecting numerous members of the human race. The reports of CE- III (IV) witnesses must be treated with human caring and concern. UFO Summit Conference By Walt Andrus Worldwide interest in attending the 1982 Summit Conference being held Monday, July 5th from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Westbury Hotel in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in con- junction with the 1982 International MUFON UFO Symposium, has been overwhelming. Many regionalized UFO study groups and organizations in the United States and Canada have already expressed interest in sending representatives to the conference by responding to the invitation extended in the December 1982 issue of the MUFON UFO journal. The major UFO organizations on the North American continent have already selected individuals from their Boards of Directors to represent them. In most cases, their Director will be the principal representative, which will help to expedite planning and decisions. Several European UFO organizations have asked permission • to present short papers, that could lead to greater international coopera- tion. It is gratifying to know that so many people are anxious to partici- pate in a dialogue that will lead to greater cooperation in UFOlogy and volunteering their individual and group talents to help resolve the enigma. The fine response to date is evidence that an apathetic attitude . does not prevail in the current leader- ship of UFO agencies. In order that each representative group may present short papers on their proposals, the entire morning (9:00 a.m. to 12 noon) will be sched- uled for this purpose. Each paper (continued on next page) 18"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Lucius Parish in Others' words While not specifically dealing with UFOs, an article in the March 9 issue of National.Enquirer tells of supposed past lives on other planets, revealed by hypnotized subjects. Researchers involved in such studies include Dr. R. Leo Sprinkle, Brad Steiger, Dr. Edith. Fiore, and Frederick Lenz. The March 16 Enquirer issue tells of a re- cent Brazilian UFO encounter with a 747 jetliner, in which the plane's pilot felt that he had communicated tele- pathically with the UFO occupants. The March 23 issue quotes Dr. R. Leo Sprinkle and Dr. Aphrodite Clamar as saying that many people may have had UFO experiences which they can- not consciously recall. The March 30 and April 6 issues have the first two installments of a new series on UFO activity in the Soviet Union. Under- water UFOs and a UFO occupant en- counter are detailed in these articles. Excerpts from Ronald D. Story's book, UFOs and the Limits of Science, are featured in the March 30 and April 6 issues of the Star. The \"Anti-Matter\" section in the April issue of OMNI has one short item on UFO sightings near Clifton, Arizona, plus other segments on paranormal/Fortean subjects. Of con- siderably more interest in this issue is an article by Vincent DiPietro (an electrical engineer) and Gregory Molenaar (a computer programmer) dealing with their research into a Viking Orbiter photograph of Mars which shows what appears to be a giant human face on the surface of the planet. Again, no direct UFO connec- tion, but still a fascinating study. Additional information on their work is available from Mars Research, P.O. Box 284, Glenn Dale, MD 20769. Summit Conference, Continued should be limited to 15 minutes max- imum. The afternoon session (1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.) will be devoted to discussion of the proposals, deter- mination of goals and objectives, assignments of projects to fulfill these goals, and preparation of a method and time table for reporting progress results to participating organizations. To make this agenda effective and managable, each delegate or represen- tative planning to present a brief paper or attend the conference should advise Walt Andrus in writing by June 1, 1982, so adequate facilities and time will be available. We also plan to publish an agenda, prior to the conference, that will be mailed to each delegate who has signified his or her intention to attend. It is an- ticipated that most of the papers will be less than 15 minutes, providing time for a greater number of prepared statements on the agenda. In the cor- respondence to Walt Andrus, briefly indicate the topic of your proposal or ideas, since this will be included on the published agenda. It thus becomes imperative for an expeditious meeting that only those delegates wh'o indicate in writing that they plan to speak will be placed on the agenda. Anyone who has already signified their intent to speak or at- tend has complied with this pro- cedure and each has received a confir- mation by postcard or letter. Roberts Rules of Order for parliamentary law will prevail at the conference, to con- trol possible disruptive individuals and to give major emphasis to our goals and objectives. Based upon early indications, this could be the most significant UFO conference ever conducted in North America. It will achieve this status, provided that each delegate and par- ticipant is willing to forget past per- sonality and group ideology dif- ferences, and come prepared to devote their talent in a positive man- ner to fresh approaches that will breed cooperation in UFOIogy. The success of this important conference hinges upon these conditions and how our reservoir of talent may be harnessed for constructive progress. The second issue of The Sixth Quark journal is now available from Editor/Publisher Tom Benson (P.O. Box 1174, Trenton, NJ 08606.) The price is $3.50 per copy; 50' extra for foreign surface mail, $2.50 extra for foreign airmail. The journal is pub- lished irregularly, with no subscrip- tions being accepted at present. The #2 issue contains articles on UFO con- tactee books, a critical look at UFO organizations, a technical piece on UFO \"motherships,\" a contribution on UFO literature from Robert Girard, plus book reviews, news notes, etc. A bit of an improvement over the #1 issue.
