FROM THE EDITOR With this issue of the Journal, I officially assume the duties of Editor—a responsibility that I take very seriously. Good reporting of UFO news is a precious commodity, and I hope to build on the base established by Norma Short, Dwight Connelly, and Dennis Hauck. Since this has to be a spare-time activity for me, I will need a lot of help from active investigators, MUFON Representatives, and others in the form of typewritten news copy, and I will take it from there. Let's not forget that \"Mutual\" in our organizational title. Considering our limited resources, a cooperative effort is essential. Both Ann Druffel and Len Stringfield, now Associate Editors, have gone that extra mile by unselfishly contributing valuable information without receiving one penny in compensation. Please do your share by contributing information, preferably in the form of manuscript copy, but all clippings, photographs, and other data will be gratefully received.

Hallstrom has been flying for 37 years and is experienced in many types of aircraft, including helicopters. A detailed investigation report with statements and sketches by the witness were submitted by Idabel Epperson of MUFON — Southern California. The case' was investigated by Lt. Col. Robert F. Bowker, USAF (Ret). Hallstrom departed from Oxnard about 12:35 PM in a Cessna 17QA en route to San Diego via Los Angeles, following a friend, Jim Victor, who was delivering another plane to a customer at Browns Field, San Diego. The plan was for him to transport Victor back to Oxnard after the delivery. The two kept in touch periodically by radio. i As he approached Santa Monica at 7500 feet altitude, within 2 or 3 miles of the airport, the sky was crystal clear except for a smog or haze layer above Los Angeles International Airport and inland around Highland Park, with tops at about 6500 feet. At this time I was looking for Jim straight ahead when I spotted (it) just on the edge of the haze area above LAX (Los Angeles International Airport) slightly to the east side approximately along about where the tower would be, and I thought it was Jim so I watched it for a minute because he had just given me his position report, but it seemed to get larger and coming toward me so I naturally realized that it wan't Jim.... 1 I observed that it was going to be to my left and below me. At this time I was observing it now as an 1. Quotes taken from tape-recorded statements by witness. aircraft of some type but I couldn't identify what type of aircraft it was, so I kept watching and it appeared to be travelling at a very rapid rate, but it being forward of me yet at this time, it was hard to judge speed.... I started looking to see what it was but I could see no wings on this aircraft although at this time I could see windows which appeared to be passenger windows in the aircraft. As it drew nearer though, I was able to determine that there were no wings or horizontal empennage, horizontal stabilizer, vertical fins, or empennage assembly to the aircraft as a conventional aircraft, so immediately, without thinking anything else (being a helicopter pilot), I immediately drew the conclusion that it was a helicopter of a passenger type...(except) that it was approaching at a rather rapid speed which made me wonder in my mind as to what type of helicopter it was because not knowing of any helicopter that would be capable of the speeds it was approaching. Hallstrom was going through a classic \"escalation of hypotheses,\" as described by Dr. J. A. Hynek, trying — and failing— to rationalize what he was seeing in terms of familiar experience. As the UFO passed about 6,000 feet to his left, he was looking down on it at an angle of about 30-45 degrees. There were no rotors or other accoutrement of a helicopter. Then the true form of the object suddenly became clear to him. ....all of a sudden I was able to make out the complete form of a saucer shape or round object as a flying saucer would be and, of course, it registered at this time as being a flying saucer... I was able to pick up the full circumference of the saucer as a complete circle and could see the dome, also very vividly clear, including all the windows which were, of course, the things I saw in the distance first. Being dark, they naturally stood out stronger than the rest of the fuselage....(I) observed it to be of a very bright metal, saying, in a sense, that it was more of a nickel or high polished chrome or stainless type of metal than aluminum because it had more of a mellow glow than (if) it was of the type finish on a high finish aluminum. There were about 16 to 20 equally spaced \"windows\" (about 18\" tall by 24\" wide) around the circumference of the dome, located just above the base. The dome appeared to be a perfect hemisphere. (See drawing by witness on front cover). The UFO continued on a steady heading of about 310 degrees (while Hallstrom's course was about 130 degrees) with no sign of rotation, oscillation, pitch, roll, or yaw — and no signs of propulsion or discharge. The sun reflected off the dome as a bright spot as the UFO passed by. After about a minute, the object disappeared from view behind the Cessna. Hallstrom estimated the object's speed at about 650 m.p.h. He rapidly took notes and sketched the UFO. At this time I was very much dumbfounded as to what to do....(nearing LAX airport) and at the same time realizing that it was • something very extraordinary that I had just witnessed... Reaching for his radio mike, he first called Jim Victor to report what he had seen. Then he reported the sighting to various FAA authorities. Eventually the report reached the attention of the UFO groups, and was reported in the Ventura County and Harbor News, January 13 & 20, 1978.

However, there are certain aspects of his experience that are puzzling to Mr. Hallstrom as well as to those of us who have studied his case closely. \"Let's start at the very beginning. Hallstrom stated that he had \"not been a disbeliever regarding UFOs\"--but he had never been sufficiently interested to read any of the UFO literature. Consequently he was totally uninformed on the subject at the time of his sighting. It is understandable that a pilot who has flown in the skies of many lands for 37 years and had not had even a glimpse of a UFO might not be particularly enthusiastic about the subject. \"The first of a series of puzzling and inexplicable incidents occurred as the UFO passed under Hallstrom's plane. He had a sudden overwhelming urge to meet with the pilot of the \"space ship\" and wished fervently for the UFO to come back and lead him to a landing place where they could meet and talk. \"A few minutes later Hallstrom passed over Downey (about 20 miles from LAX) on his way to San Diego. Ten minutes from the time Hallstrom saw the UFO over Santa Monica, a UFO was seen and reported over Downey. The description was- the same. Could it have been the same UFO? If so-did it \"come back?\" This is pure speculation, of course. The UFO Hallstrom saw over Santa Monica was headed for the Hollywood Hills-- the oposite direction from Downey. \"The second puzzling incident occurred a couple of nights later. Hallstrom and his wife, Gwen, were both awakened by a noise that seemed to be inside their bedroom. They searched but found nothing. Then they heard a high pitched humming sound. Hallstrom rushed"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"UFO AND SOUND-VIBRATION PHENOMENA This incident took place in the vicinity of the town of Nykoping on April 12, 1977 at 10:37 AM. Farmer Carl-Olof Lindmark, of Ene farm in the community of Stigtomta about 10 kilometers west of Nykoping, was walking toward his garage when all of a sudden he felt a powerful vibration that seemed to be transmitted by the atmosphere. Instinctively, he covered his ears to prevent his eardrums from bursting. After a few seconds, the vibrations, stopped abruptly. However, they resumed after only a few seconds and kept on for an additional 3-4 seconds before again ceasing. The ground also seemed to shake, and he noticed that the windowpanes bulged and shook. Both Lindmark and his father, who lives only about 100 meters away, were gripped by a splitting headache. The entire phenomenon lasted only about 6 seconds. The By Prof. Bertil Soderquist (MUFON Representative for Sweden) \"sound\" seemed to be emitted from a source located above him, although he could not see anything (he says that the sky was overcast at the time). At about the same time^ Carl- Anton Mattsson made an observation in the town of Nykoping, where he was busy in his grocery. He felt vibrations of low frequency, lasting about 6 seconds that caused the large display windows in his shop to bulge and vibrate severly. The sould was barely audible, having an estimated frequency of 40 Hz. Yet another person sitting in a basement (presumably nearby) was working with his electron microscope, but failed to pick up any vibrations. This latter observation is consistent with the fact that seismologists did not register any earth tremors at this time in the Nykoping area. A fifth observer, a woman living in neary Oxelosund, was reading at this time in her apartment when she was startled by a shrill whisting sound. Thinking it was an aircraft, she dashed to the window and saw a circular, brownish disc approaching from the NW (i.e., approaching in a bearing from Nykoping). The UFO was at an altitude of about 100 meters. She estimates that its diameter was about 4 meters. Suddenly, it stopped dead in its course and hovered for about 4 seconds. She then saw that the disc had a probe shaped like an antenna, the top of which was fitted with a sphere. When the UFO suddenly resumed its journey, a strong noise was heard causing the windows to vibrate. The UFO disappeared toward the southeast. The sky was overcast at the time of the observation. (From UFO- Information, Sweden, No. 3, 1977) Daylight Disc, Continued outdoors but saw nothing. \"The third incident(s) occurred three different mornings during the week as Hallstrom opened his front door to go to work (it was still dark) he saw a light hovering over their house. He is fully acquainted with the lights on all kinds of aircraft. He said positively that it was none of these. He was not approached. \"But the most puzzling and disturbing of all was the change that had come over Hallstrom himself. He told me that he had a very uncomfortable pressure in his head that he had never had before. Also he had trouble sleeping and some nights he did not sleep at all. Here again, this was a new experience for him. To add to his discomforts, when he did sleep, he had disquieting dreams, mostly about UFOs and aliens. This too, was a new experience; previously he was not even aware of dreaming. In spite of all of this he still maintained that he would go with the aliens willingly if they came after him. When I asked him, \"Why?\" he answered, \"Because they have superior intelligence and we have much to learn.\" \"Mr. Hallstrom's lack of knowledge of the UFO movement plus the seeming indifference he encountered when he attempted to report his sighting led him to think that the public was not aware of the presence of aliens from space. This was understandably frustrating.  ' \"We have talked to Mr. Hallstrom from time to time, by phone, since his sighting. Our last conversation with him two days ago was very encouraging. He is feeling very much himself again and \"back to normal\" as. he put it.\" Floyd Hallstrom, whose parents were both pilots, has been flying for 37years. During World War II he served as a Navy combat air crewman and mechanic on all types of aircraft, and was a Navy Chief for 17% years. He served as personal crew chief for the Commander-in-Chief of the Atlantic Fleet, and on the crew of four other admirals subsequently. He is also an experienced helicopter pilot."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"UFO FRAGMENT By Dkka Serra (MUFON Representative for Finland) This is the most significant case in the history of UFO Research of Finland. It involves a strange fragment that fell from a UFO on to Kallavesi Lake in August 1964. The event was witnessed by Mr. Raimo Blomqvist (43) of Kuopio. The fragment has been studied.both in Finland and in Sweden, at two universities, at four metallurgic laboratories, etc. A huge amount of documents has been accumulated: about a hundred photographs, electron microscope analyses, interview tapes, X-ray analysis papers, personality ratings, etc. So far every piece of information has supported Mr. Blomqvist's story. We don't know of any natural objects or machines that the fragment could have originated from. It was a Saturday afternoon in August 1964 (the last or second to last Saturday in August) that Mr. Blomqvist and his family drove to their summer house. It was cloudy but warm. There were no winds over the Kallavesi Lake. After having chopped wood for the sauna, Mr. Blomqvist went for a.walk on the shores of the lake. He had a strange feeling that something special was about to happen, but he couldn't figure out what it might be. He stood on the cliff for a while, and at about 7 PM he saw a light in the ME. The light grew in size and Mr. Blomqvist realized that it was approaching him. The silent UFO stopped at a distance of 10 meters from the witness and hovered a couple of meters above the water. Mr. Blomqvist was surprised and excited, but not afraid. He felt a \"force field\" around himself. The UFO was multicolored, oval in shape, and surrounded by a hazy light. The left edge of the object was bent upwards as if the UFO had collided with something. The light was relatively bright, but no reflections were seen on the water. There was a vibrating movement on the water directly below the UFO. The object was three or four meters in diameter and a couple of meters high. After 20 seconds of hovering, a small fragment fell from the UFO to the shallow water. A hissing sound could be heard when it hit the water. The fragment looked as bright as a welding light before it landed. Now the yellow, green, and orange color stripes on the UFO began to glow brightly and the UFO zoomed into the clouds within a second. The speed was enormous since the clouds were at an altitude of 300 meters. Now Mr. Blomqvist wanted to find out what had fallen to the water. The water was only 20 centimeters deep at the site of the incident. It was easy for the witness to find the fragment since it differed from the surroundings. He picked it up and put it into his pocket. He didn't say anything about the incident to his family. In February 1975, Mr. Blomqvist met some UFO \"research people at Turku and so the case was finally made public. One of the UFO research people, Mr. Mikko Toivola, took the fragment to Abo Akademi University where an X-ray analysis was performed. Professor Edelman stated that material of this sort could be found close to active volcanoes, but only at a couple of locations in the world. The fragment is definitely not a geological entity, continued professor Edelman. An expert on meteoroids, professor Papunen at Turku University stated that the fragment is not a meteoroid. As far as iron is concerned it could be an iron meteoroid, but the amount of other substances does not support the meteoroid theory, and the fragment contains some substances that have never been found in meteors. The fragment was 36 millimeters long before it was cut up for studies. It was 6 millimeters thick, weighed 15 grams, and had a density of 4 kg/dm 3 . The fragment was not radioactive, but it was magnetic. There were five layers of material. In the middle there was a 2.5 millimeter thick layer of light-colored metallic iron. On both sides of the middle layer there were dark grey layers and 0.5 millimeter thick light grey layers. The thickness of the layers varied. Fragment from UFO in Finland According to an expert on metal studies, engineer Olavi Kiviniemi, the contents of the fragment were as follows: The middle layer: Mostly Fe and O (The contents were analyzed by mass spectrometer.) 1.0% Mn 0.4% Cu 0.3% Si, V, Ti 0.1% P, Na 0.06% Sn 0.03% Cr, W, K 0.008% Ca 0.006% Ta Other layers: Mostly Fe and O 0.8% Zr 0.6% Mn 0.3% Si, P, K 0.2% Cu, Zn 0.1% Mg, Na 0.04% Rb 0.03% Ca, La, Ce, Nd"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"CANINE MOTHER HIDES PUPPIES FROM UFO By Idabel Epperson (MUFON Director for Southern California) All was quiet and peaceful in the Semaza household (City of Orange, Orange County, California) at 3:30 AM Saturday morning February 4, 1978. But that serenity was soon to be replaced by a general commotion and downright frenzy on the part of \"Susie,\" the family pet — a gentle little dog that had given birth to her first litter of puppies two days earlier. Sometime between 3:30 and 4:00 AM a weird humming sound awakened Mrs. Claire Semaza, her 14- year-old daughter, Donna, and 11-year- old son, Eric. A neighbor, Mrs. Dorothy Pascl, also was awakened by the humming sound which continued to increase in volume until Mrs. Semaza said that it hurt her ears. Susie's whimpering developed into frantic howls and barks, which ceased (UFO Fragment, continued) 0.01% Sm 0.009% Pr 0.006% Pb 0.004% Sr 0.003% Ba Apparatus like mass spectro- meter and scanning electron microscope were used to perform the studies. The fragment is not a piece of ore, not of volcanic origin, not a meteoroid, and not a piece of any known machine. However, nothing supernatural has been found either.' The fragment has probably been affected by a very high temperature around 650 degrees Celsius. Substances like carbon and sulphur have practically disappeared, if they ever existed. The high temperature has radically reduced the amount of clues about the origins of the fragment. However, the UFO Research of Finland will continue to study the case. periodically for a few seconds while she stared at the wall with an expression that baffled the members of the family. Susie continued this behavior for 30 minutes. In the meantime Mrs. Semaza and her son and daughter were curious as to what was causing the loud humming sound — which Mrs. Semaza described as sounding as if a \"mob of people were humming.\" Donna thought about recording the weird sound but couldn't find the tape recorder in all the excitement. It was probably just as well; Susie's wailing would, no doubt, have drowned it out. When they looked out the window facing south and east they saw an object oval in outline. It seemed to be not far above the trees and not more than a half mile away. (She thought it could have been two blocks.) In one area the sky above glowed with a pinkish color and a little distance away, above it to the left, was a hot, clear red color. Below and around the object was a layer of haze or \"smoke,\" gray in color. The object seemed to be hovering but soon started rising very slowly leaving the smoke layer behind. (Shades of the Rex Heflin UFO and the smoke \"ring it left behind!) The object had a bright red light at each end which sent shafts of light toward the ground. There were several bluish white lights strung horizontally between the two red lights. The object rose higher, flashed a brilliant white light on and off for approximately three seconds, then quickly disappeared. We have not gone into details here about the three witnesses; they were excellent witnesses who studied the mysterious object, remembered what they saw, and reported everything carefully and fully. The unique part of this story has to do with a gentle little dog called \"Susie\" and her reaction to the presence of a UFO. We also thank the humans in her family for observing Susie's problem — and how she solved it. Susie made her anguish known clear and loud. It seems apparent that when Susie realized that her humans were not going to solve her problem that she had better do it herself. There she was with seven puppies to protect, and she must have felt that extreme danger threatened. The cozy box that she and the puppies occupied was on the ground floor. She carried a puppy upstairs and tried to hide it in a couple of places — the last place she .tried was under the bed — but that didn't satisfy her. She took the puppy out from under the bed and hid it behind the drapes. This was the right place, she thought, so she carried the rest of her puppies one by one upstairs and hid them all behind the drapes. . Can anyone top this for animal reaction to UFOs? Recently Bob Kirkpatrick called on Mr. and Mrs. Semaza for the purpose of taking photographs of Susie and her puppies. Susie was uery friendly and seemed even pleased and proud for the attention her puppies were getting. Bob told me, \"Susie has personality!\" ****** *.* ************ Postal Exchange Contributions of cancelled foreign stamps are used by MUFON to exchange with a collector for current U.S. postage, which helps to offset the high cost of foreign correspondence.

Stringfield Since the debut of the movie extravaganza, \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\", with all its sensational publicity in the media, reports of UFOs in the tri-state area of Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky, have been at an all-time tow. In fact, UFO reports during the year 1977 in this region have been significantly scarce. Obviously, the movie has not provided the stimulus, as predicted, to, create a wave of UFO sightings. But we do have a ripple. The ripple began with the sighting and reporting of a green fireball on January 18, 1978. This random event triggered publicity in the Kentucky edition of the Cincinnati Post in which I was quoted in the form of a headline. This, in turn, brought forth earlier stories which we have learned to expect and to hope for in research. But the movie had no part in prompting the green fireball sighting. The reports came from a dozen independent witnesses who had not seen the movie. The other reports I received were close encounters, also from people who had not seen the movie. On January 18, 1973, at 9:30 PM, Patrolmen Ron Jones and Al Winn of the Erlanger, Kentucky, Police were driving home from their shift, when Jones witnessed a lime-green, egg- shaped, noiseless \"fireball\" flying low in a straight course. He called to Winn, \"Look at that!\" Winn looked in the opposite direction at first, then turned too late to see the object vanish behind trees. Jones said it moved very erratically before its vertical descent near the Greater Cincinnati Airport in Boone County, Kentucky. Said Jones, referring to the face of a clock, 'It moved from 3 o'clock to 9o'clock, up to 12, down to 6 — roughly making the figure 4.\" The Control Tower at the airport was called but they had not seen 8 the green fireball. They had no explanation, however, the operator said that an aircraft was approaching to land about 9:30 PM. The next day I received several phone reports describing the green UFO. One came from Dave Dobbs of MUFON, who had received a report from an associate of his radio net, a pilot, who had witnessed from his home in Cincinnati, a bluish green disc, the size of a full moon, breaking through the clouds as it descended to the ground. Also the next day, my comments about the green fireball drew headlines in the Kentucky Post. I was beseiged with calls, many relating firsthand reports. One witness in Covington, Kentucky, described the large teardrop-shaped object as \"very green,\" which she said suddenly dropped from its straight flight course and \"floated to the ground\". Two other witnesses, while driving home from the University of Cincinnati, agreed in their report that the huge green object made a slow vertical descent. Still another witness described in her letter to me, '1 saw the object streak across the Cincinnati sky about 9:30 in a ME to SW direction. It was in view for about 15 seconds, but its color was yellow\". Another report of a close encounter came from Melody Harrison in Florence, Kentucky. By happenstance, Melody is the niece of Patrolman Ron Jones. Melody and Ron's four-year-old son were out playing in the heavy snow at 9:30 PM. Suddenly she saw a large, round, green object as big as a car soar low overhead. The object, she said, flew straight across a building nearby, then turned and went straight down. \"I saw two white flashes from the ground\", she said, \"but I could hear no sound.\" The close proximity of the object terrified her little companion who cried in fear during a sleepless night. A meteor? Perhaps. But meteors do not fly erratically and are not normally green. According to the color described by at least a dozen witnesses, the object is analagous to the green fireball phenomena observed over the U.S. Southwest in 1948. That flap prompted the establishment of \"Project Twinkle\", which, following its study of the phenomena, never satisfactorily explained the nondescript missiles. Whatever the answer for the green fireball, the media's coverage of the incident brought me other UFO reports. On Sunday, January 15,1978, at about 7:10 PM, a single engine Sundowner flying from Evansville, Indiana, to Cincinnati encountered a UFO flying a collision course, approximately 22 miles north of Louisville, Kentucky. The pilot, accompanied by his instructor and girlfriend, related that he was flying at 5,500 ft. when he spotted two bright lights at eye level at some unknown distance ahead. Suddenly one of the white lights began to move horizontally away from the stationary light, then it made a perfect circle, and then another, while remaining at the same distance. This erratic behavior continued for several minutes, then the animated object became brighter, looking like a \"blob\" and began what appeared to the pilot, to head in a collison course with the Sundowner. As the blob came menacingly closer, ,the pilot, fearful of collision dove his craft down 1,000 ft. In an instant, the white blob streaked overhead and out of view. The pilot told me that when he arrived in Cincinnati he called the Standiford Control Tower in Louisville, Kentucky. He was told they had no"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"UFO confirmed by radar, but had received calls from'people in the area who had seen a UFO. Judy and husband Rick G. called me on January 23, prompted by my name appearing in the Kentucky Post. Judy related their close encounter with a UFO sometime around Christmas, 1977, perhaps a few days before. Living in Ft. Mitchell, Kentucky, near a small lake and a wooded area on the end of a deadend street, Judy explained that she and Rick were watching the late show on TV at 1:10 AM when suddenly their living room was bathed in an eerie green glow. \"It came through the curtain,\" she said, \"flashing three times.\" Both she and her husband jumped up and scurried to the window, there to see an egg-shaped object, glowing green, about 50-100 ft. distant in a low hovering (touch landing) position. Both Judy and Rick estimated the soundless ovoid object to be approximately 10-15 feet in diameter; that its equator was encircled by a solid row of green flickering lights which had cast a greenish glow on its entire surface.   . The object was in view for about 3 minutes. As Judy and Rick watched, the object rose slowly, vertically, picked up acceleration, then leveled off and disappeared into the wooded horizon. The UFO left no traces and caused no physical or electromagnetic effects. Before I had knowledge of the Judy and Rick G. experience, I was called by one of the local newspapers and asked to make a statement relative to a 5-year-old Kentucky boy's mysterious disappearance on December 21, 1977. The boy, Keith Holliday, was last seen near a construction site. There were no clues, no suspects. A reporter asked if I thought a UFO had been the culprit. Of course I refused to make a statement for many reasons. Apart from the moral and other sensitive issues, I had no data to suggest that a UFO had been reported in the suspect area—Erlanger, Kentucky—during the time frame of the boy's disappearance. Two days later I received a second call for a statement, but I declined again. I have not been asked again, even though Keith's disappearance still remains a mystery. I will not volunteer the Judy and Rick encounter as a possible tie-in, even though its occurrence may have been the same day as Keith's disappearance. Actually, there is not a shred of evidence to suggest a link to a UFO, and it would be unwise to speculate on the matter in the local press. Avoiding the media in many instances is necessary in UFO investigation. And in most instances it is necessary to keep the names of witnesses confidential. As an example I had to sacrifice a major promotion for my book, SITUATION RED, in the National Enquirer when the editors of the tabloid, who wanted to serialize five UFO close encounter stories selected from the text, asked that I divulge the names of the witnesses. I declined and SITUATION RED was dropped. Still another case in point, with a request for anonymity, surfaced to me privately, following the green fireball incident. This incident also occurred in Kentucky in the residential area of Bellevue, across the Ohio River from Cincinnati. On July .15, 1977, at 10:45 PM, while Mrs. Fem Frey (name changed) was lying in bed with her 11-year-old daughter who was asleep, she was shocked to see her bed light up in a bright green glow. Thinking that her home was being burglarized, Mrs. Frey jumped out of bed. The glow, she observed, was coming through one of two windows in the bedroom. Moving cautiously, she peeked through the curtain, and to her bewilderment the green light beam retreated, \"just like liquid being drawn up through a straw\". In a matter of seconds the light was \"siphoned\" up into a low hovering object that was shaped like an inverted saucer, which Mrs. Frey estimated was a couple of hundred feet away. She was certain .that the object, which she guessed was about 30 ft. in diameter, was metallic. The moon's glow reflected on it and she could determine that its visible surface was clearly divided in equal-sized squares. The bottom of the object was in darkness, appearing flat, and it was into this section that the recoiling beam of green light was drawn. 'It looked as though the beam was sucked in,\" she said. When the beam vanished, the object gracefully lifted and disappeared into a wooded area. Mrs. Frey said that nothing electrical in her house was affected. A dog in the kitchen behind a closed door made no sound, nor did her daughter awaken. The next day she called the Federal Building in Cincinnati to report the incident. She was referred to me, but decided not to call because she already had told two friends who had laughed.   . I am convinced that Mrs. Frey had a real and frightening experience. While she was describing the details of the incident, she broke down. Mrs. Frey cried for a full 3. minutes, emotionally unable to describe the behavior of the light beam. I called Mrs. Frey again in the evening. More composed, she related the story in full. She felt relieved. When I inquired about physical effects, Mrs. Frey said she experienced nothing extraordinary during the event or during the days that followed. However, she admitted almost reluctantly that when the light beam struck her on the bed, her fear completely vanished. \"It was a strange feeling,\" she said, \"I just felt no fear whatever. Then when the light withdrew, I suddenly was seized with fear. I can't explain it:\" As I write this, February 7,1978, I have received two additional UFO reports from the Tri-State area. These were nocturnal lights. I am also aware of another alleged landing occurring in Danville, Kentucky, about 2 months ago, but the two women who shared the close encounter are reluctant to relate their experience. I am told they are too terrified to talk, and fear ridicule."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"THE HAPPY CAMP, CALIFORNIA SIGHTINGS By Paul Cerny MUFON Western Regional Director, Part 2 This is a continuation of the somewhat bizarre series of UFO- related incidents that were reported to us by various local participants in Happy Camp. Again we wish to remind the reader of the difficult situation and problems involved in obtaining these details as to verification and credibility. The distance to the area (420 miles) limited the time to investigate on a weekend basis, let alone the personal expense involved on many weekend trips to this location. One remote sighting area was impossible to hike into and out again on a given weekend. In the abduction case, we carefully weighed the value and expense of bringing a qualified hypnotist that distance. Discussing this value with several prominent top scientists in the UFO field, we came to the conclusion that under the uncertain circum- stances, it may not be wise to possibly jeopardize the mental health of witnesses. We were informed by those that have made studies in this area that it is possible, perhaps in some cases, to inflict permanent damage as a result of such an attempt, particularly by amateur or unqualified hypnotists. As an example, one such attempt was made recently on one of the witnesses by a self-proclaimed hypnotist from another organization and ended up in failure and an emotionally upset witness as a result. Pros and cons will be argued by various individuals as to the safe or dangerous results obtained in using hypnosis for the purpose of extracting subconscious information: but it is felt this should be decided and dealt with by qualified medical professionals trained in the subject. The second Happy Camp encounter came the same night after the first \"creature\" sighting and the Ford Bronco was practically suspended with its four wheels spinning, throwing 10 Steve Harris, witness to \"creature\" sightings, with his Ford Bronco. gravel. Driving back to town, the three told their, story to Helen White who insisted they take her back to the spot. Returning to the exact location about an hour later and accompanied by Helen and a young friend by the name of Rick Pool, the five disembarked from Steve Harris* Bronco and proceeded to shine their lights around the same area where they had seen the creature. Nothing could be seen. Helen had brought a Polaroid camera and flash attachments along and was holding it. Thinking there was nothing there to see, the five decided to leave. \"If there is anything around here, this should wake them up,\" commented Steve, and shot off his rifle several times. Immediately there was a loud \"wow-wow-wow\" sound behind them. The group turned quickly around in the direction of the eerie sound to observe three forms about 30 to 35 feet away. These appeared to be about five feet high, vaguely in the form of a human but a dark non-reflecting form with a glow around the edges or outline. No eyes were seen. These objects were casually moving around but staying relatively in a small area. They came no closer nor did they retreat. With all that bright light on these weird forms, a bare glowing outline was all that could be seen. It was as if the moving forms were absorbing the illumination. Occasionally as the group observed, the whole form would slightly glow. No details were discernible. Steve began to yell at Helen to take a picture, repeating it several times, but Helen just stood there staring, wide-eyed and apparently unable to react. Questioned thoroughly about why she did not snap a picture, she could not explain why. She just seemed frozen with awe and fright."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Steve even shook her once attempting to get her to respond. The question of mind manipulation came up as a result of this, but how does one determine such a possibility under such bizarre conditions with a complete unknown! Steve continued to persuade Helen to use her camera, but she finally blurted out, \"Do you feel weight on you?\" She said, \"I feel like something is choking me!\" Suddenly all three began to feel a choking sensation. Carl and Stan were back farther and did not notice this unusual effect right away. Steve remarked later that it felt as if his clothes were getting heavy on him and it was getting very difficult to breathe as if the oxygen was being depleted from the air. There was no odor detected of any kind. (This brings to mind a similar situation of the 1964 Cisco Grove \"Bow and Arrow\" case in California where a deer hunter had climbed a 30-foot pine tree to escape his humanoid alien pursuers and claimed to have been gassed from the ground under him by several creatures. He described a similar effect as if he were breathing mostly nitrogen. He eventually passed out, awakening periodically with the \"dry-heaves.\") Steve later assumed it could have been a directed mass haullucination, but was uncertain. He still felt he was having extreme difficulty in breathing. The forms appeared to remain in an approximate 30-foot area as they moved slowly around, never approaching or retreating.He thought they possibly kept their distance because Stan Gayer was standing back farther near the Bronco with a loaded 30-06 rifle. This particular sequence lasted for three to four minutes. The group then decided that under the peculiar circumstances, they had better leave. They all piled hastily into the Ford Bronco and left the area heading back down the mountain to town. When they got into the car, the breathing problem disappeared for all involved. There was no apparent vapor, smoke, or other gaseous material noticeable except low clouds overhead, which are common to that area. Steve I OBSERVERS Diagram of UFO sighting area with sketch of the U.F.O. thought the whole situation could have been mental. As their vehicle climbed to the top of the hill where they began the descent down the mountain, they looked back to the spot and saw a glowing orange-reddish disc-shaped object rise up from near where they were and follow them all the way down the curved road to the highway where it took off and left them. The glowing orange disc sometimes appeared to look like a ball of fire, stayed within about 150 feet over them and off to the right above the trees. It appeared to be about 40 feet in diameter. Needless to say, their speed down the mountain road in the Bronco was considerable! This all took place on October 26,1975. All agreed at the time, they would tell no one what they had seen that night, as no one would believe them! The credibility and justification of the many sightings that were reported going on in the Happy Camp area by the local enthusiasts, sometimes numbering from five to ten persons to a sighting, finally hit home to us. Confirmation of the activity was bestowed on us in a rather startling manner. On the night of February 17th, 1976, Tom Gates, MUFON Astonomy Consultant and head of the Foothill College Space Science Center and myself were on the mountain top along with Helen White. Helen, who probably is the most devoted and constant observer in the area, and the oldest adult (63) was in her small pickup truck, Tom and I in my small station wagon. Part of the time we all three sat in Helen's truck watching all around and (continued on next page) 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"(Happy.Camp, continued) trying to keep warm as it was around freezing temperature and there was some snow on the ground. Occasionally, we would split off, Tom and I in my car, and move off a short distance from Helen, keeping in touch by C.B. radio. After frequenting the mountain top saddle area from 8:00 to 12:00 PM on that dark moonless night and seeing absolutely nothing, we decided we had \"had it\" for that night. We were cold and had to frequently start and run the car engines and heaters to keep warm. Observation had mainly been directed to an approximate ten degree upward angle toward the lookout tower where the only spot of light in the sky, except for the many stars, was a 60 watt light bulb glowing routinely on top of the distant fire lookout tower about a half mile from us (see sketch). Thoroughly disappointed in our 4-hour futile surveillance for that cold night, we decided to go back down the mountain to our warm motel room. Before leaving we decided to stop at one turnout area near one of the winding curves about a quarter of a mile down the mountain road. This we did. I left my car out of sight around the curve and Tom and I . walked back about 100 feet where Helen had stopped with her pickup headed away from theJooko,ut tower..^ She remained in her truck listening to the C.B. radio while Tom and I stood about 30 feet away looking once more in the obvious direction of the lookout light, as if it was something magnetic to us. For about 5 minutes, we saw nothing, then suddenly we both noticed an orange glow behind the dip in the ridge down to the right of the tower. The glow almost reminded one of a forest fire behind a hill, only there was no smoke. A few seconds later with increased glow intensity, a large rectangular shaped object rose slowly up from behind the ridge, exposing itself in its apparent entirety, then after a couple of seconds, slowly lowered itself back down out of sight where it had come from; the glow remaining as 12 Helen C. White at the fire Lookout Tower on the mountain top. before it first appeared. It then rose up a second time, repeating the first performance, as if taking a second look at us. After it disappeared the second time, we excitedly waited for it to show . again, but after a 2&minute wait in the cold, we decided it was gone for the night. Helen did not see the spectacle as she was busy tuning her radio. Tom and I were both so fascinated in what we were observing that we even failed to yell at Helen to look. Taking into account that the whole event took only a matter of seconds may have had something to do with our reaction or negligence thereof. The object was completely silent and in that still cold night air any definite noise could surely have been heard. Later we were both kicking ourselves as we had packed away our telephoto cameras in the car about 100 feet away. The object itself was the most brilliant, deep vivid orange color of glowing substance I have ever seen. It was almost indescribable. It was not comparable to anything that I had ever observed before. The orange was so deep that it was almost red, yet there was no red color apparent, just deep brilliant orange. The object was more or less sharply outlined against the dark starlit sky. in its rectangular shape with rounded corners. What impressed me the most was its brilliance. The rays of brilliant orange illumination were emanating and streaking out in every direction from the object as bright light would shimmer off of crystal. Tom had quickly lifted his binoculars to his eyes and remained glued on target as I was with just my eyes. He got the impression of a slight yellow area in the center. Our estimated distance from the object was three-quarters of a mile. The next morning we returned to the saddle area. By taking in the area the object had occupied in the dip of the ridge against the skyline and counting the tree stumps of the logged-off section beneath the dip, we estimated the object was approximately 35 to 40 feet across. One other interesting aspect of our sighting was why we"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"simply stood there for another 20 minutes waiting, then drove back down to our motel in Happy Camp. We talked about that for some time the next day. What we should have done immediately was to get back into the car and race back up to the saddle area, then on around and behind the mountain to see if we could have caught sight of the object at close range. The road did go behind the mountain. We would have been within about 200 yards of where it was. Why didn't we have the presence of mind to do this? It was exactly what we should have done! Were we \"mind- manipulated\" at the time not to take this action? It is a speculative guess, of course, but we now wonder if this was the situation, without our realizing it at the time. Should a similar situation ever present itself, I hope that we may have the ability and incentive to overcome any such effect. In a subsequent issue of the JOURNAL, we will cover the abduction case and other unusual sightings at Happy Camp as parts 3 and 4.

These magnetic disturbances or faults result from concentrations of minerals with magnetic properties. These fault areas are intense enough to cause a compass needle to deviate from its normal magnetic north orientation. The amount of deviation varies depending on the intensity of the fault. This variance may vary from a few degrees to forty-seven degrees. Pilots must be aware of these faults if they are to navigate by non-radio means. Consequently, these faults are marked on pilot sectional maps. CUFOS has recently compiled a list of sightings in total, close encounter, and occupant state-by-state. These sightings span a five year period ending April 1977. We reviewed sectional maps to see if high frequency states have magnetic faults in them. Our findings are presented in table I. The number in parenthesis on the left represents the number of UFO cases. The underlined states are those states which have intense magnetic faults. The number in parenthesis on the right represents the number of fault areas in the state. We found that of the 10 top listing for total sightings, close encounters, and occupant sightings, about one-half of the states were states which had magnetic faults. Pennsylvania, By Dave Oldham, MUFON, Field Investigator and Wayne Laporte, MUFON State Section Director for North Carolina California, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, and Georgia show up repeatedly in all three lists. Four of these six states have magnetic faults. However, not all the states have magnetic faults. So, again nothing is 100% consistent. What does this mean? The phenomena may re-enter or materialize at the faults and then move outward of a limited radius of operation. Or we may be dealing with two different types of UFO phenomena. One may be able to operate independently of faults. The other may have an affinity for the magnetic faults and has to remain in the fault areas. We discussed the fact that some researchers, particularly John Keel, believe that there is a direct connection between magnetic fault areas and repeat sighting areas. In North Carolina, the repeat areas are in the eastern part of the state and along the North Carolina/South Carolina border near Charlotte. There is also a magnetic fault in each area. How about the U.S. as a whole? Major magnetic disturbance areas are indicated on pilot sectional maps. These maps are put out by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin- istration. They are available for about $2.00 each at most airports. We studied all the sectionals for the U.S. The U.S. magnetic faults are listed in Table II. The CUFOS \"top ten UFO sighting states\" are listed in Table I. This survey is based on UFO cases handled by CUFOS between April 1972 to 1977. Both the magnetic faults and CUFOS 48 state frequency counts were plotted on a map of the U.S. We also overlayed a UFO sighting density map, (on the map with the plotted fault areas). Our density map is based on a UFO sighting density map in Brad Steiger's Gods of Aquarius. Steiger's map reflects UFO reports for the past 100 years. The fit between the CUFOS survey on a state-by-state basis and the Steiger map is good. The distribution of magnetic faults in the U.S. is generally in line with the sighting density of UFO's. The faults concentrate: on the West Coast; mid-Western states; lower mid-central states; Eastern coast. UFO sighting density is heaviest on the Western and Eastern coasts. The sighting density follows the magnetic fault distribution with the following exceptions. There are several faults in the mid-Western state area. This area includes Utah, Wyoming, Montana, Colorado. Neither the CUFOS or Steiger map indicate a heavy sighting density in this area.

Frank Salisbury investigated many of them, and wrote a book about it - The Utah UFO Display. These states are low population density states. So, there may be a lot of UFO activity there, but no one to witness it. Then again the UFO entities may prefer the East and West coast rather than the mid-central states. The magnetic faults are not centrally located within the high density areas. This implies both a radius of operation and selectivity of direction on the part of the UFO intelligences. They don't \"work out\" equally in 360° from the magnetic faults. There appear to be other factors which determine the density of UFO sightings in the fault zones. These factors could be: geological fault lines; concentrations of psychic people in the area; missile bases; air bases; power stations; nuclear plants; etc. Then, within each major \"window\" there are minor \"windows\". So, there must be additional factors which determine local concentrations. This magnetic fault study doesn't indicate whether the UFO phenomena is an extraterrestrial or paraphysical manifestation. Although we are not students of the occult, we've been told that magnetism plays an important part in entity materializations. Magnetic fields have been reportedly generated by seance materializations. Uri Geller can affect magnetometers. Then again as Schmirer was told (by UFO occupants) UFOs may use \"reversible electromagnetism\". If so, then magnetic faults may play an important part in their navigation and operation in our atmosphere. Regardless of what their origin, UFOs in the United States appear to have some affinity for magnetic disturbances. There also appears to be some directional selectivity of operation by the UFO occupants around the magnetic fault areas.

Nykoping, Province of Soderman- land, Jan. 8, 1977, 3:35-3:55 PM—This series of incidents was witnessed by about 30 persons, living in Nykoping and surrounding towns. The following description of the event was given by Mrs. Bakkalas, as seen from her flat on Brandkarrsvagen in Nykoping. \"We (she and her family) discovered a bright object over the water tower. It resembled an inverted (?) light bulb, and shone with a steady white light. Shortly afterward, the light changed to yellow, the shape of the UFO was altered, and then it disappeared immediately. Suddenly, a red, oval UFO appeared. It approached the chimney of the hospital where it stopped. \"A few minutes passed, and then yet another UFO joined the first one at the chimney. For three minutes, both UFOs hovered around the chimney, moving jerkily about. Then, a third UFO appeared. All three UFOs then circled just south of the hospital. All three were red in color, the appearance being that of molten iron, and emitted a strong, pulsating light. A couple of minutes passed, and then two huge discus-shaped UFOs joined up with the three smaller ones (their size was, somewhat diffusely, described as that of \"airplanes\", my comment). The latest arrivals had a cupola on top. No sound was heard. A couple of minutes passed, and then a propeller-driven aircraft, followed by what appeared to be an airforce jet, approached the five UFOs. The UFOs then disappeared toward the SW.\" The airforce base in Nykoping contacted UFO-Sweden, whereupon 18 UFO-Sweden alerted its observers in areas likely to be overflown by the flotilla of UFOs. No observation was made of the UFOs, however. Following this incident, local military headquarters requested access to the investigations carried out by personnel from UFO-Sweden. It seems that part of the interest from the side of the military authorities stems from the reported sighting of a military jet aircraft, although as far as is known to UFO-Sweden, no military aircraft was reported to be airborne at the time of the incident. (This case has, I think, its greatest implications in the fact that it might precede a change in attitude toward the activities of UFO groups on the part of the military. It will be very interesting to see if it is a permanent change.) Nysater, Province of Varmland, Jan. 5, 1977, 1:15 P.M. — Truck driver Helge Olsen was on his way from Oslo to Stockholm on route E18 when he observed a shining object which seemed to hover just above the road surface at a distance of 1,000 meters. He stopped his truck, jumped out and approached the UFO on foot. The UFO turned out to be resting on the road, supported by five legs. It was shaped like a discus, had a diameter of about seven meters and emitted a steady red-green-yellow light. The legs were glass-like and shining. Four of them were placed around the perimeter and one leg was placed in the middle. At a distance of about 150 meters from the UFO, Olsen suddenly found himself immobilized. Standing there, he also heard a faint sound as from an idling car engine. He then saw another truck approaching the UFO from the other side. The truck stopped, and he recognized the truck as one driven by his colleague from Stockholm, on his way to Oslo. The UFO then lifted vertically in a whirl of snow, and he was able to go back to his truck. The UFO made a pass over his truck, rose and disappeared. The period of observation was about five minutes. Following the incident, the two men talked it over, and agreed not to report it to the police. (I find some similarity between this case and the one reported in MUFON UFO Journal, No. 115 of June 1977, p. 14). Kiruna, northern Sweden, Dec. 28, 1976, 4:30 A.M. - Mrs. K. Burlin observed an unusually shaped light phenomenon when she awoke early in the morning, for reasons unknown. She then saw a large object, shaped like a light bulb, moving irregularly across the morning sky. The UFO seemed to emit a white light, which however, stopped short just outside what seemed to be the physical boundaries of the UFO. Inside this \"boxed-in\" light shone another, yellow light. She observed this UFO for a total time of about 10 minutes, when the UFO disappeared, still moving in its irregular pattern. (I think this \"contained light\" effect is very interesting, and seem to remember that similar reports have appeared in SKYLOOK some time back. What do physicists say about the possibility of creating such an effect?) ******************** Memphis Press —Scimitar - Tenn.

U.S. subscription rates would be approximately $7.00 per year and inquiries may be addressed to the General Secretary of EUFOSG, Mrs. Gloria Seville (16 Raydons Road, Dagenham, Essex RM95JR, England). The Winter 1977-78 issue of ARGOSY UFO is now on the stands. This magazine is now being published on a semi-annual basis at $1.50 per issue. Robert Barrow's three articles are perhaps the most interesting items in the current issue. Jerome Clark's two articles in the February issue of FATE should be of interest to all Ufologists. The first article deals with the famous case of Father Gill's sighting (along with several other witnesses) of humanoids on board a hovering UFO at Papua, New Guinea, in 1959. The inadequacies of the \"explanations\" for this case by skeptics Menzel and Klass are clearly pointed out. The second Clark article is actually an interview with Jacques Vallee, in which the French astrophysicist gives his thoughts on the theoretical UFO \"control system\". The March issue of UFO REPORT has material on ancient astronauts, Atlantis, the UFO medical evidence and other Ufological topics. One of the better contributions is an article on an African landing/occupants case, written by Cynthia Hind and Joe Brill. If you are interested in science- fiction films and TV programs and you are not familiar with STARLOG, you are missing some outstanding reading material. STARLOG is published eight times per year and should be available on your local newsstands. The March issue contains an article by James Oberg on \"real and 'reel'\" UFOs; that is, UFOs as depicted in s-f films and as reported in real life. Unfortunately, it is a typically super-skeptical Oberg article, but it is highly appropriate that it should be published in a magazine dealing with science-fiction. UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE The UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE will keep you informed of all the latest United States and World-Wide UFO activity, as it happens! Our service was started in 1969, at which time we contracted with a reputable international newspaper-clipping bureau to obtain for us, those hard to find UFO reports (i.e., little known photographic cases, close encounter and landing reports, occupant cases) and all other UFO reports, many of which are carried only in small town or foreign newspapers. \"Our UFO Newsclipping Service issues are 20-page monthly reports, reproduced by photo-offset, containing the latest United States and Canadian UFO newsclippings, with our foreign section carrying the latest British, Australian, New Zealand and other foreign press reports. Also included is a 3-5 page section of \"Fortean\" clippings (i.e. Bigfoot and other \"monster\" reports). Let us keep you informed of the latest happenings in the UFO and Fortean fields.\" For subscription information and sample pages from our service, write today to: UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE Route 1 — Box 220 Plumerville, Arkansas 72127 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE by WaltAndrus Plans for the upcoming \"Ninth Annual MUFON UFO Symposium\" on July 29 and 30 at the Dayton Convention Center in Dayton, Ohio, will be reviewed briefly in subsequent editions of the JOURNAL as more details become available. The theme for 1978 will be \"UFOs: A Historical Perspective on Close Encounters\". A clue to the contents of the program is evident from the title of Leonard Stringfield's paper \"Retrievals of the Third Kind — A case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants in Military Custody\" and Ted Bloecher's humanoid study group report analyzing 1,500 cases. We have found it financially wise to not schedule a banquet for Saturday evening and instead to allow participants to eat wherever they choose. However, there will be a private dinner for the speakers and the host committee. All speakers will be staying at Stouffer's Dayton Plaza Hotel, 5th and Jefferson Streets, where rooms have been \"blocked\" for symposium attendees. Ticket prices for individual sessions will be the following: morning - $3, afternoon - $4, Saturday evening - $4 and Sunday afternoon - $3, with a package price of $12.00 for all sessions. Reservations may be made in advance by making a check payable to OUFOIL and sending it to the Symposium Treasurer, George Pelizzari, P.O. Box 544 Forest Park Branch, Dayton, Ohio 45405. Hotel reservations should be made directly with the hotel of your choice. If you select Stouffer's Dayton Plaza Hotel, please advise them that you are attending the UFO Symposium so they will assign one of the \"blocked rooms\" for you. The February issue of the JOURNAL will list other speakers' subjects. The Sunday afternoon program promises to be a surprise. On Sunday morning from 9 to 12 noon, the Mutual UFO Network, Inc. will conduct it's annual corporate meeting for members only. Roserta Holmes would like to remind everyone about the \"10th Annual UFO Picnic\" to be held Sunday, June 25, 1978, at the Fish Hatchery Park in Carlyle, Illinois, starting with a fabulous picnic dinner at noon. Leonard Stringfield, MUFON Director of Public Relations and author of the recent book \"Situation Red: The UFO Siege\", will be the featured speaker. UFO abductees Betty Hill, Charles Hickson, and Elaine Thomas will attend this big event. We are extremely proud to announce that Willard P. Armstrong, Ph.D., MUFON State Director for Missouri and a Consultant in Chemical Engineering, has been selected to replace Frank R. Salisbury, Ph.D., on the National Enquirer's UFO Blue Ribbon Panel, joining John L. Warren, Ph.D., MUFON State Director for New Mexico and Consultant in Physics. John R. Schuessler, Deputy Director of Administration, is MUFON's representative on the National Enquirer Mini-panel. Stan Ferguson, State Section Director in the Dallas, Texas, area is also acknowledging new members by welcoming them to MUFON upon receipt of their processed membership applications in a similar manner to that of Leonard Sturm in Illinois. Your Director will meet with William A. Dexter, State Director for Texas, on April 12th in Dallas, along with other MUFON members in the immediate area to plan for expanded operations and improved communications. A new and unique UFO HOT LINE has been placed in operation by Radio Station KONO in San Antonio, Texas, a 5000 watt AM station, broadcasting on a 24 hour schedule. Hourly announcements are being made to not only publicize the new service for south Texas, but to explain how the UFO reports will be given to the Mutual UFO Network for investigation. To simplify remembering the telephone number, Southwest Bell provided the number 226-UFOS. A model 70 Code- A-Phone, connected to this number, automatically answers each telephone call with a short explanatory message then records the sighting report as related for follow-up purposes and subsequent investigation by MUFON Field Investigators. Bill Dante, Operations Manager for KONO, has spearheaded this new public service and has become MUFON's State Section Director for Bexar County. Lee Woods, an announcer and producer for the station, recorded nearly 2 hours of taped interviews with your International Director to be used on special weekend programs. Bill and Lee may be contacted by writing to Radio Station KONO, P.O. Box 2338, San Antonio, Texas 78298, or by telephone at 512/225-5111. George Fawcett, State Director for North Carolina, has appointed William K. Smith, 622 North 7th Street, Smithfield, NC 27577, as the new State Section Director for Johnston County. Bill has had 10 years of law enforcement investigative experience. As previously noted in the JOURNAL, the \"1981 MUFON UFO Symposium\" is scheduled to be held in Los Angeles, hosted by MUFON of Southern California, with Mrs. Idabel E. Epperson, State Director. The host for the 1980 Symposium has not been committed, however it is now being taken into serious consideration by a large city in the Central Region. MUFON 103 OLDTOWNE RD. SEGUIN, TX 78155"}]
