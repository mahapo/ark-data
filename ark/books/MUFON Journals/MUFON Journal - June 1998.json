Leir Alien implants A 1998 update By Dr. Roger K. Leir On August 19, 1995, a historic surgery took place in Camarillo, California. A surgical team was assembled that performed the first in a series of sur- geries for removal of alleged alien implants. To date, seven such surgeries have been performed. . These surgeries sought to answer several ques- tions: Do such implants actually exist? If they do, can they successfully be removed without destroying them or caus- ing harm to the patient? In addi- tion, if this can be accomplished, what would be found and what function do the implants have? These are only a few of the questions raised. Many ru- mors pertaining to implants float through the field of ufology like a storm floating through the sky. I researched the literature only to find a sparse amount of material that would help my cause. Some attempts to remove objects had been made previously, and the net result was dismal failure. One successful attempt resulted in an object that was examined by an eminent scientist, Dr. David Pritchard, at a well known university in the eastern United States. After careful examination he declared the object to be made of earthly material and therefore delegated it to the land of ordinary objects. Dismal failure? There were other stories describing the removal of objects that were stated to have disappeared, turned to powder, or just magically vaporized. Were our ef- forts to result in the same dismal failure as the others? Only time and effort would produce an answer to these questions. My association with my partner, Derrel Sims led to the formation of a new organization: The Fund For Interactive Research in Space Technology, (F.I.R.S.T.). This group would setup the rules pertain- ing to how these surgeries were to be performed and establish criteria and protocols that would ultimately gain the respect of scientific organizations such as the National Institute for Discovery Science (N.I.D.S.). We knew that it would not be enough to just successfully remove suspected alien implants, but it would also be necessary to have them analyzed by qualified institu- tions who would report their findings on a letterhead that contained the researcher's name and signature. The first surgeries consisted of two candidates, one female and one male. They were both subjects of the alien abduction phenomenon with objects in their bodies that appeared on x-ray examination. These first surgeries resulted in the extraction of three objects, two from the toe of the female patient and one from the hand of the male. On X-rays the three objects appeared to be metallic. When they were removed from the body, all the objects were covered with a dark gray shiny mem- brane. Attempts to open this cocoon were surprisingly fraught with failure. They resisted the cutting of a sharp, new, surgical blade. This was not what I expected to find, nor did my colleague, the general surgeon who performed the procedure on the patient's hand. Unable to cut object The shock of not being able to cut through an ordinary piece of biological tissue was only one of the many surprises that became apparent with the first sur- geries. Others included the violent reaction of the pa- tient to having the objects touched, especially with the use of both a hypnoanesthesia along with a compound local. In addition, the patients reported to our psycholo- gist that both individuals suffered pain one week prior to the surgical event, and when they were interviewed post-surgically, they independently reported \"a new found feeling of freedom.\" Both Derrel and 1 queried the psychologist. We asked her opinion about this re- mark, inquiring whether this was actually the release of surgical apprehension. Her answer was a definitive NO. These first surgeries also provided us with pathological reports that initially appeared very strange. Specifically, a large amount of nerve proprioceptors were found in the surrounding tissues. No medical or anatomical literature was located that would support the normalcy of this finding. The total apparent lack of an inflammatory response also raised the eyebrows of numerous pathologists who were consulted. These find- ings have been the subject of numerous professional and amateur debates. Personal attacks I personally was attacked on the internet nu- merous times by armchair scientists who have nothing better to do. The remarks usually boil down to: \"It could be this or it could be that, but is definitely not what is reported.\" My answer to these individuals is always the same: \"Please show me in the medical or pathological literature where there are similar findings!\" The metallurgical findings in the first two cases have also produced results that have required continu- ing research. The findings of Los Alamos National Labs and New Mexico Tech offered the following: one ob- ject contained a core made of the hardest iron carbide known that was magnetic. The core was covered with"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 June 1998 MUFON UFO Journal :i r^HUr •*'••',;£ The T-shaped object removed from the toe. It has been placed on a gauze. a complex cladding of eleven different elements. In addition, the complementary component contained a carbon core that was soft and magnetoconductive. Review of the electron-microphotographs shows several distinct and interesting features of this T complex. The extreme left end of the horizontal por- tion appears to have the shape of a barb, something like a fish-hook. The opposite end is rounded like a bullet. The very bottom central surface shows an in- dentation that offers the exact shape so that the verti- cal portion will fit into this cavity in a most precise manner. In addition some of the more magnified sec- tions demonstrate remaining white portions of the mem- brane as it is seen attached to the metal. Also, one of the more interesting features is an ultramagnified por- tion of the vertical rod which demonstrates a band of crystals that completely circles a portion of the ob- ject. Independent scientific review has convinced some of our scientific consultants that this object has been manufactured, with purpose and precision. If we look at the simplest portions of this structure, we can make a comparison to one of mankind's most simple antique structures. I remember in my childhood of tak- ing a copper coil, a battery, earphones, a small crystal and some wire and being able to receive a radio pro- gram. Yes, the simplest of constructed devices was the crystal set. Is it possible that there are structures that could perform numerous complex functions using such technology as the superatom and neutrinos? This is ex- actly what one of our consulting engineers, Bob Beckwith, has theorized. On May 18, 1996, the surgical team again be- came active. This time there were three surgical candi- dates, two female and one male. The male had what appeared to be a metallic foreign body in his left lower jaw that was demonstrable in an X-ray. The two fe- males demonstrated a small radio-opaque object in each leg. They also had small skin defects which had be- came apparent the morning following an alleged ab- duction. It was decided to not only remove the deeper visible objects, but also to excise the entire portion of the skin defects. One of the procedures was performed only with hypnoanesthesia because the patient was massively allergic to all forms of local anesthesia. Derrel worked"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal June 1998 PageS s ( I v with the patient several days prior to the actual sur- gery to prepare her for the anesthesia. When the day of the surgery finally came about, our general surgeon was amazed that he could perform the procedure with- out additional help from chemical agents. These surgeries resulted in the recovery of one small metallic triangular object covered with a dark grey shiny membrane, and two small greyish-white balls, about the size of a BB. The two small balls were identical to an object that was removed by one of our dermatological consultants who worked with me on a previous case. There was also a skin lesion present in this case which was tentatively diagnosed as Calcify- ing Epithioloma. The dermatologist believed the little greyish- white ball to be an ordinary calcium deposit. He was amazed to find that the material analysis showed a multitude of combined elements never before seen at- tached to a skin pedicle. In addition, the clinical his- tory for this type of skin lesion was completely back- ward to that of the textbook clinical history. THE BIOLOGICAL FINDINGS Of the seven procedures performed, three were metallic objects covered with a dense, gray, non-fibrous membrane that could not be opened with a surgical blade. Analysis of the membrane demonstrated it was composed of a protein coagulum, Hemosiderin gran- ules, and keratin. These are all natural substances found in the body. Research of the literature demonstrated this combination of natural body substances has never been seen before. The surrounding soft tissue was microscopi- cally devoid of any type of inflammatory or rejection process, either fresh or resolved. The tissues contained nerve proprioceptors, which are never found in the anatomical location that the specimens were surgically excised from, which was in the deep tissues next to the bone. Three of the procedures resulted in the recov- ery of three BB sized, small greyish-white balls. These balls were firmly attached to the underside of a soft tissue lesion involving the skin. The pathological analy- sis of the soft tissue specimens demonstrated either no inflammatory response or some infiltrate of cells, which were small in number and usually seen with this skin abnormality. The one outstanding and unusual factor was that in two of the three cases the pathologists re- ported solar Elastosis, meaning that the dermal layer of the skin had been severely exposed to ultraviolet radiation. I found this rather shocking, as neither surgi- cal candidate admitted to a history of overexposure to sunlight. Both were typical family type individuals who did not spend time gardening or lying on the beach. Another question I had to consider was that if the en- tire extremity was exposed to excessive ultraviolet, then why was only one small 4 to 5 mm portion of the skin involved. The microscopic analysis showed.the areas to be well demarcated, proving that the.-radiation : did not exceed the boundaries of the skin lesion itself. In both cases the lesion mimicked the traditional scoop mark type defect found on alleged abductees. The specimens fluoresce The aforementioned six surgical specimens had another commonality: they all fluoresced under ultra- violet black light. We do not fully understand the mean- ing of this at the present time, but some of our research- ers are working on the cause of the fluorescence and how it is related to this phenomenon in general. The seventh surgical case resulted in the exci- sion of a glass or crystal-like object. Early light and diffraction microscopy has shown that the surface of the object is crazed and marked in a fashion that would indicate it is neither glass nor crystal. There was no soft tissue removed with this surgery; therefore there are no biological findings to report. THE METALLURGICAL DATA I must hasten to point out that, at this date, the process of evaluation is ongoing. We have found that scientific acceptance is based on large amounts of sci- entific raw data which may be interpreted differently depending on the background of the individual scien- tist. The first metallurgical results came from the analysis performed by Los Alamos National Labora- tories. These tests were done on the samples removed during the first two surgeries, as well as the little grey- ish-white ball removed from the neck and shoulder area of the third case. They have been designated the ( T ) group, e.g.. T-l, T-2, etc. The first test performed is\" called Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) LIBS was used to determine the elemental com- position of the samples. The samples were small rod- like materials 1-2 mm in diameter and less than one cm in length. Because of the small size of the sample surfaces when observed under a microscope, it was decided that LIBS was a suitable method to determine elemental composition because of its micro-sampling ability and relatively nondestructive analysis capabili- ties. Under microscopic examination, some of the samples appeared to be metallic, and all but one sample (T-4) were observed to have areas of visually different appearance The method of analysis is as follows: LIBS is an elemental analysis technique in which powerful la-"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Page 6 June 1998 MUFON UFO Journal Metallic object below jaw. ser pulses are focused on the sample to generate a hot micro-plasma (10,000 degrees K). Because the laser beam can be focused to a small area, this method has microsampling capabilities. The microplasma vapor- izes a small amount of the sample (less than 50 nano- grams), and excites the resulting atoms to emit light. The light is then collected, spectrally dispersed, and the resulting spectrum is recorded to determine the el- emental composition.. Because each element has a unique spectral signature, the elements can be identi- fied by analysis of the spectrum. The intensity of the emission lines can be used to determine the concentra- tions of elements if the sample has uniform composi- tion. The following is the result of this elemental analysis: (Al=aluminum, Ba=barium, Ca= calcium, Cu=copper, Fe=iron, Mg=magnesium, Mn=manganese, Na=sodium, Ni=nickle, Pb=lead, Si=silicon, Ti=tin, Zn=zinc) T-2 Black Portion Ca, Cu, Fe Al, Ba, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni Brown Portion Ca, Fe, Ba, Cu, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Si T-3 Black Portion Ca, Cu, Fe, Ba, Mn, Na White Portion Al, Ca, Cu, Fe, Ba, Mg, Mn, Na, Si Rust Portion T-4 Black Portion Ca, Cu, Fe, Ba, Mn, Na Ca, Cu,Fe, Al, Ba, Mn, Na, Ni, T-l Scaled Portion: Na, Ni, Pb, and Zn.

These tests should include X-ray crys- tallographic and metallographic analysis to elucidate the sample structure (grain boundary structure, unusual metal phases, preferential grain growth).\" Recommendations requested When these results were received we immedi- ately contacted N.I.D.S. and asked their recommenda- tions. It was decided that further testing should be per- formed. We were informed their board would make a decision as to who should perform the next set of tests. It took several weeks before we heard from N.I.D.S. again. They informed us that another world class labo- ratory had been chosen for the next batch of testing. This laboratory was New Mexico Tech. We received this information in a letter from N.I.D.S. which stated the following: \"One purpose for N.I.D.S.' involvement was to establish some appropriate standards for initial test- ing of materials samples. A number of experts were consulted to determine what non-destructive tests were appropriate at this stage of the investigation. The bat- tery of tests for structural, chemical and electromag- netic analysis recommended and conducted include: Density immersion technique in toluene Mechanical properties analysis including hard- ness and elastic modulus X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy Scanning electron microscopy X-ray diffraction pattern analysis Electro/magnetic properties analysis All analysis was double blinded We all waited with bated breath for the results from New Mexico Tech laboratory. In a telephone con- versation with John Alexander, who was directing the research at N.I.D.S., I learned there was a problem pertaining to reporting the results of the extensive ex- amination performed by New Mexico Tech. It seems the contract signed by them did not include the termi- nology which would allow them to render an opinion pertaining to the test results. John told me they were working on the problem and it would be resolved soon. At that point I really began to understand the politics involved in scientific testing. Results released Finally, in September of 1996, the results were released to me from N.I.D.S. They had resolved their problems with the laboratory and faxed me the letter of opinion containing the results. On the top, in large black letters, it said New Mexico Tech Letter of Opin- ion (Samples Tl, 2 and T3). (See appendix) The more I read, the more confused I became. I wondered what had happened to the other samples which Los Alamos had done. It took a phone call to N.I.D.S. and a conversation with John Alexander to clarify the matter. New Mexico Tech had not used the same coding system which Los Alamos had used. In- stead they had subdivided the samples into A and B portions. In addition the sample designated T-6 was not sent to the second laboratory at all. The letter of opinion contained two major state- ments. First, they indicated that the T-3 sample con- tained 11 different elements. Sample Tl-2, contained an iron core. The tests also indicated that iron and phos- phorus were major constituents of the cladding mate- rial surrounding the iron core. The second statement had to do with a com- parison to meteorites. They thought this was the most likely material for these fragments to have come from. On the other hand there was a problem with the nickel- iron ratio. It seems that most meteorites contain be- tween 6 and 10 percent nickel. They also stated that no meteorites contain less than five percent nickel and to resolve this discrepancy they deduced that these specimens could be just fragments of meteorites. I was astounded by this revelation and knew I had to do some- thing to help clarify the issue. Both Derrel and I were certain that our patients did not step on a meteorite or hit one with the back of their hand. A call to the lab I called the lab and talked with the individual who wrote the report. I told him I was going to tell him something that he might find shocking. With that warn- ing, I said that the samples were obtained from the human body through a surgical procedure. As a result of that, the metallurgist rendered an additional opinion which would ultimately prove to have little merit. The final letter of opinion contained an additional general statement responding to the fact that I'd said these samples were obtained from the human body. It stated that an iron-silver mixture im- bedded into the body could cause a calcification reac- tion. It also stated that medicine and dentistry have used ceramic materials for many years. Unfortunately, the metallurgist's biological opinions did not hold water. In actual fact, no ceramic materials at all are used today because of the tremen- dous inflammatory reaction which occurs when they are instilled into the body. There were many biological findings which the author of the report did not know about our cases. One was the complete lack of any inflammatory reaction. Also he did not know that the specimens were covered by a strange, gray, dense bio- logical membrane. Last of all, there was no evidence of a portal of entry. In summary, the metallurgical analysis has il-"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Page 8 June 1998 MUFON UFO Journal lustrated the following points: The T-shaped object is composed of two small metallic rods. The horizontal portion contains an iron core which is harder than the finest carbide steel. This rod is magnetic. The iron core is covered by a com- plex layer of elements which forms a cladding. One portion of this cladding has a crystalline band which circles the rod. When viewing this rod, as seen in the electronmicophotograph, it appears to be structured. One end is in the shape of a barb, while the opposite end is flat. In the center is a small depression. The shape of this depression conforms exactly to the shape of one end of the vertical rod. The vertical rod con- tains a similar cladding, but the core is composed of carbon instead of iron, and it is magnetoconductive, not magnetic. Objects have a purpose It would seem these are structured objects which serve a purpose. This purpose has not been de- termined yet. We hope that further study will provide answers regarding function. There have been numer- ous individuals who have expressed interest in study- ing or postulating the function of these objects. One such person who has been working with us is Robert Beckwith, an electrical engineer. He has put forth a theory of how these objects might work, and is work- ing on a book which will include his findings about them. We have been asked many times to speculate as to function. I feel it is safe to put forth theories, but these must be looked at scientifically and either proved or disproved. One such theory pertains to their ability to act as a tracking device or transponder. This would enable someone or something to find their subject any- where on the globe. Another possibility is that they may act as behavior controlling devices. We know that abductees seem to have compulsive behaviors. I be- lieve a more plausible purpose might be a device for monitoring certain pollution levels or even genetic changes in the body. This may be similar to the way we monitor our astronauts in space. Only more time, effort and study will answer these questions.

Box 9972, Memphis, TN 38190 for $5.00) Vatican theologian says UFOs are real Reported by Richard Boylan Monsignor Corrado Balducci, a Vatican theo- logian insider close to the Pope, has gone on national Italian television five times in recent months to pro- claim that extraterrestrial contact is a real phenomenon. The prelate announced that the Vatican is re- ceiving much information about extraterrestrials and their contacts with humans from its Nuncios (embas- sies) in various countries, such as Mexico, Chile and Venezuela. Monsignor Balducci said that he is on a Vatican commission looking into extraterrestrial en- counters, and how to cope with the emerging general realization of extraterrestrial contact. Balducci provided the Catholic Church's analy- sis of extraterrestrials, emphasizing that extraterrestrial encounters \"are NOT demonic, they are NOT due to psychological impairment, they are NOT a case of en- tity attachment, but these encounters deserve to be stud- ied carefully.\" Since Monsignor Balducci is a Vaticin expert exorcist, and since the Catholic Church has historically demonized many new phenomena that were poorly un- derstood, his proclaiming the Vatican's non-censure of these encounters is all the more remarkable. Balducci revealed to a visiting American clini- cal professional from the Academy of Clinical Close Encounter Therapists, that the Vatican is closely fol- lowing this phenomenon. Parallel information from MJ- 12 scientist Dr. Michael Wolf suggests that the Vatican is concerned that it will have a major doctrinal updat- ing situation on its hands when extraterrestrial contact becomes authoritatively announced by world govern- ments over the next several years. UFO summary from Finland By Ilkka Serra MUFON Representative for Finland The UFO Research of Finland gathered 150 sighting stories that ranged from the 1940's to the end of 1997. Only 8 % remained unexplained. Two thirds of the cases referred to the 1990's. A total of 62 cases took place in 1997 and 4 cases (6%) remained unexplained. The unexplained cases were daylight discs. So it was an average year, with no UFO waves. The media interest was also average. Five new UFO books were published in Finnish. There were 372 newspaper stories and 163 magazine stories that year, and there were 83 radio or TV programs referring to UFOs."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal June 1998 Page 9 A comparison of abduction reports By Thomas E. Bullard The holy grail of UFO research is objective evidence. A chance to rap the hull and hear it ring, to see the President shaking hands with an alien before news cameras and not just on a tabloid cover, to lay bodies and exotic wreckage before scientists, or at least to confound skeptics with photographs and radar re- turns too reliable to question—these are sweet fixtures of the ufologist's daydreams. All too often the promise proves a mirage, and the evidence evaporates when investigators draw too near, but the direction is the right one to follow. Ab- duction reports teeter on a precarious brink between the objective and the fantastic. Of course they are sur- real, incredible, we might as well say impossible; yet many honest people claim the experience, and some- times multiple witnesses affirm it. These reports have tantalized us with a lively gossip of objective intimations—implants, body marks, missing fetuses, ground traces, instances of people ab- sent during an abduction or returned to find themselves locked out of the house. We've heard these claims and waited for the documentation, the proof in hand—and still we wait. The direct evidence remains suspect. It has proved only its own bashfulness, hiding from close inspection and never more substantial than a rumor. The case for consistencies Behind the front lines, researchers have built a less persuasive but more accessible case around con- sistencies in the reports themselves. The similarities of abduction stories stood out plain to see as soon as ufologists had two cases to compare. Successive com- parisons have reaffirmed this first impression. From two cases to hundreds, and onward to thousands, the same content and sequence of events recur from one report to another throughout a burgeoning database. The sense that these similarities tell an important truth about the phenomenon has grown into an article of faith. If direct or physical evidence proves scarce, elusive, or ambiguous, this indirect evidence looms large as a sure clue that something strange is going on. Liars typically fail to keep their lying straight, fantasizers trim their stories to suit personal needs, even borrowers from media accounts take creative liberties in the retelling. By contrast, abductees are an odd lot. Rather than the heroes of their own adventures, they are the victims, subject to an impersonal series of events whether they like it or not—and usually they don't. They report these events with the fugitive uncertainty of pawns in a game too vast to observe in its whole- ness and too obscure to understand with their limited ration of facts. Some very intriguing X factor holds these stories together. Little wonder then that ufologists ask how so many people can tell a similar story unless they share a similar experience? Followers of the ongoing dispute between Dan Wright and Stuart Appelle in the MUFON UFO Jour- nal [1,2,3,4] have learned that the road from consis- tency to conclusion has more wrong turns and dead ends than straightaways. Similarities in stories cannot prove aliens. The pitfalls of probability, a lack of con- trols, uncertainties in the data, and a multiplicity of possible causes gang up to undermine the appearance of consistency and any implication of objective events. Having been impressed with the similarities and an ad- vocate of their importance, I have another two cents to add to the controversy, based on two studies of my own. The first study The first study, completed in 1987, compares sequence of events and content from abduction reports available in the literature up to 1985 [5]. Of nearly 300 cases, the most valuable are 103 that offer both extensive information and reliable investigation. A sec- ond study from 1995 draws on a survey of 13 abduc- tion investigators, who answered an extensive list of questions about the content of their personal collec- tions of reports and based their responses on an over- all sample of some 1700 cases [6]. Whether comparing reports within the 7957 study or responses from the 1995 survey, the same general conclusions apply—abduction reports bear ex- tensive similarities to one another no matter who in- vestigates, how abductees recall the encounter, in what year or what country the story originates. Enough differences creep in to suggest that na- tionality, media, or cultural concerns shape the story to some extent, but most of these apparent influences seem to nibble around the edges and leave the core story untouched. Any explanation for abductions must still reckon with an impressive lineup of likenesses. With two studies on hand, a new dimension in comparison becomes possible—how do the findings from reports in the literature stack up against the re- sponses from 13 seasoned investigators?

This number was indeed final, because 1 could not check the respondents' files or second-guess their answers. For the 1987 survey I had more flexibility. I could try to understand how the survey participants read the questions I asked them, then reexamine the 7957 reports in this light and count the appropriate descrip- tions. For example, a survey question about feelings at the onset of capture or just prior to it asks in how many instances do abductees express a sense of restlessness, anxiety, foreboding, or \"something's about to happen.\" This question combines several possible feelings. A meaningful comparison requires a tally of all these pos- sibilities among the 1987 cases, not just one or two. Another type of adjustment concerns the sample base to use in calculating the percentages. When questioning respondents about examinations, the ques- tions ask, \"how many examinations\" include such-and-such a feature, and since not every report describes an examination, a respondent might well answer in terms of cases with examinations rather than in terms of the entire sample. For the 1987 data, 72 cases include details of the examination, so 72 replaces 103 as the appropriate divisor for calculating percent- ages related to examination.  ,••••- The ambiguities Nine features pose enough ambiguities to al- low two reasonable answers. Including marginal cases of light beams raises the percentage from 36 to 40. Instances of flotation or levitation permit a strict con- struction that omits out-of-body sensations and vehicles lifted off the ground for a total of 37%, or a broad con- struction that accepts any example of lifting sensations for a total of 51%. The implant category likewise may honor only"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Page 12 June 1998 MUFON UFO Journal cases where the abductee receives a tiny object (17%), or embrace any probe into the head, interest in that re- gion, and cases of thoughts added or removed (42%). The development of ESP in abductees after an encounter scores 18%, but enlarging the category to include all paranormal experiences in the wake of ab- duction boosts the number to 42%. If the beings prom- ise to find the abductee again, or the abductee feels sadness during the return episode, percentages are 18 and 17 respectively; but counting these same elements if they occur at any time during the abduction, the num- bers rise to 27% and 25%. Human or Nordic? Ambiguous descriptions are especially hard to score. When is an occupant merely human or a Nor- dic? Questionable cases make the difference between 14% and 11%. Humanoid noses are vestigial in 82% of cases, or 91% if flat noses mean a small or rudimen- tary structure. Descriptions of the craft swing.between 55% and 77% depending on whether the base sample includes all reports describing external appearance, or only those reports specifying a shape rather than just a luminous object. Ringing up the totals after these adjustments leads to a striking discovery: percentages throughout the two samples converge on corresponding figures, falling quite close (differing by only 10-12%) for 53 out of 66 features. A sizable gap separates the percent- ages for just seven content features (meaning every feature in the table except circumstances). Here then is a remarkable finding—not only do sequence and content elements recur from report to report, but most elements of the abduction story repeat with like proportions in two distinctive samples. Four of the seven exceptions appear in the aftermath sec- tion, where 1987 falls short of 1995, but this outcome is hardly surprising. In the earlier days of abduction research, investigators often rushed into print without extensive followups, and these oversights most often slighted aftereffects. Missing time disparity? A peculiar disparity afflicts the \"missing time\" feature, with 88% in 1987 and only 44% in 1995. Yet the proportion of full-consciousness cases is almost the same in both samples, leaving doubts about how the survey respondents interpreted this question. The excep- tions to the rule actually prove unexceptional after all. Dan Wright has described the MUFON Abduc- tion Transcription Project and its findings in several publications [1, 7, 8, 9]. This project brings together a sample better standardized than anything I had to work with, and combs the reports in. finer detail than I was able to do. As an added bonus, any tallies of story ele- ments he announces are separate from my evaluations and inevitable biases. A chance to compare our findings opens the first real opportunity to test for similarities between independent samples. Thanks to his heroic efforts to reconfigure his category definitions and base sizes for compatible docking with mine, the \"Wr\" column in the table displays percentages based on terms very close to those I used in the 1987 and 1995 samples. Wright did not track six items from the table and could offer no estimates for them (duration, age of abductee, memory loss at entry, theophany, change of habits, and head shape of humanoids). For four others he could provide only approximations—bedroom cap- ture, missing time, and more than one encounter domi- nate his sample at a level above 90%, while abductees fully conscious of their experience number less than 10%. He is able to provide figures for 57 features, and of these, 23 fall within 10-15% of the values from both the 1987 and 1995 samples, while an additional 11 meet these standards for either the 1987 or 1995 samples. Use of instruments Of the 18 features that differ from both the 1987 and 1995 findings by more than 25%, two concern the use of instruments during examination and leave con- siderable room for confusion. Warnings and prophe- cies are also difficult to distinguish. Wright admits that some aftermath aspects were not followed with con- sistency, possibly a reason why scores for eye irrita- tion, dehydration, and ESP are low. On the other hand, he found few reports of MIB encounters in his sample. Considerable differences sur- round descriptions of the examination room and the nose, ears, and mouth of the beings. Using figures from Wright's earlier published account [9] diminishes those differences considerably and brings his findings more closely into line with my own (see the numbers to the right of the slash in the table). Genuine differences in his sample includes a higher proportion of bedroom captures and repeat ab- ductions than in the previous studies, though his find- ings follow a trend already apparent between 1987 and 1995—the great hidden mass of reports seems to lie with people taken from their homes rather than from highways or elsewhere. Repeat abductions appear to be the norm rather than the exception. Reproductive aspects of the examination also show a dramatic in- crease, though greater awareness, on the part of abductees and investigators may account for the growth. A more diversified crew comprises Wright's sample than the others, with slightly more Nordics, robots, and monstrous beings aboard, though the fa- miliar humanoids not only remain dominant but ap-"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal June 1998 Page 13 pear as frequently as ever. Abductees in Wright's sample are considerably less likely to describe the be- ings as cold and businesslike, and equally more likely to find them warm and friendly than earlier abductees. These evaluations are of course subjective, and should be read in the context of a sample where the abductees are as likely as their predecessors to find the polite- ness of their captors manipulative and insincere. So many likenesses among the three samples is notable, especially considering all the opportunities for misconception inherent in the comparison. These samples are quite different in acquisition, and unstandardized in procedure. They were not designed similarity with comparison in mind, and so much simi- larity points toward a robust consistency in the stories abductees tell. Caution called for Even as impressive as these similarities first appear, Stuart Appelle is quite right when he cautions against reading too much into likenesses alone. Sig- nificant doubts also overshadow the reliability of the match-ups themselves. Percentages are a crude tool of comparison at best, and shortcomings in the 1995 sur- vey compromise its results from the beginning. The respondents gave only impressionistic estimates from their samples, not close counts. They usually answered in terms of \"few,\" \"some,\" \"many,\" and \"most,\" rather than specific percentages, and I assigned a number rep- resenting the middle of the range defined for each of these categories. This procedure clusters the figures around convenient benchmarks when the percentages might more naturally spread across a broader range of possibilities. I further distorted these hypothetical percent- ages when I averaged the 13 responses into a single figure. Its \"truth\" can be understood in positive terms as the natural tendency of the underlying phenomenon, with investigator idiosyncrasies pared away by the averaging process, but a negative understanding is also possible. In unfavorable terms, the same figure mis- leads when it suggests all investigators agree. In fact the responses of one or more of them scatter some dis- tance from the mean for almost every feature; conse- quently the 1995 respondents appear more unanimous than they really are. All in all, cumulative error in the 1995 percentages could be considerable. An honest point Critics score another honest point when they worry that similarities rest on my decisions. I am re- sponsible for separating like from unlike, interpreting how respondents \"really\" understood the survey ques- tions, and establishing the terms to calculate percent- ages, but prone by human weakness to irresponsible choices. My procedures stack the deck in favor of simi- larities, since the choice belongs to me alone and I can stretch a point in uncertain situations. 1 can search and re-count from cases in the 1987 database until I arrive at the \"right\" answer, or try out several possible sample sizes for a particular element until I find the most fa- vorable base for calculating percentages. Although I believe the current table represents the most accurate accounting of the 1987 reports I have attempted, I must admit the terms are slippery enough for the percentages to change somewhat each time I reevaluate the data. Like a test with several right an- swers, this search for similarities includes a built-in bias in favor of success. Wright's results gain all the more in value because he does not share my exact bi- ases, though neither did he enter blind into the work— I had to explain what I was looking for before he could interpret his data to be compatible with mine. Just to make a comparison possible meant compromising its objectivity. If procedural problems are not serious enough, the inherent ambiguities of the data further entangle the outcome. Most data in abduction reports are ver- bal and therefore potentially misleading. Verbal descrip- tions that seem to describe a standard humanoid may clash with an illustration the abductee provides, dem- onstrating how imperfect a verbal image can be. The lines between categories are often too fine to see, as , may happen in attempts to divide humans from Nor- dics or prophecies from warnings. Expectation may slant the comparison toward similarity where a less expectant evaluator might find only false appearances or no resemblances at all. Systematic errors A host of systematic errors threatens abduc- tion reports before comparison even begins. Sample bias attaches to abductees as closely as a shadow, since the very act of reporting sets them apart as a self-selected group, contaminated in some degree with abduction ideas and having a vested interest in accep- tance of their claims. Investigators also bring familiarity and personal opinions to their task, and even with 13 investigators in the survey and 50 in the 1987 sample, they all share an exposure to the abduction literature that might carry over to standardize reports through confabulation with subjects or editing of the case reports. Wright and I are both guilty of knowing what a \"right\" abduction story looks like, and abduction ideas now circulate so prominently in popular culture that they are familiar to everyone possessed of more awareness than a garden slug. The pristine claimant died years ago in a flood of media exposure. Discovering that abduction reports tell a recur- rent story amounts to a halfway stop on a longer jour-"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Page 14 June 1998 MUFON UFO Journal ney. Similarities narrow down the plausible explana- tions by undercutting notions of hoaxes or personal fantasies, since creative and idiosyncratic tendencies ought to send the story spiraling into new and unfamil- iar directions from narrator to narrator and from telling to telling. For a similar reason, abductions differ from folk narratives circulating by word of mouth. What folklor- ists know about urban legends makes clear that the variation process sets to work on belief narratives to generate rapid, inventive modifications, while long, fan- tastic, loosely constructed narratives like abduction re- ports should be all the more vulnerable to alteration. Their stability contradicts an identity as folk narratives. Cultural influence? This same stability calls into question explana- tions of the reports as products of cultural influence, such as science fiction movies and literature or folk beliefs about fairy kidnap and shamanic initiation. Any fair treatment of these potential influences must recog- nize that movies and literature, folklore and mythol- ogy contain an abundance of ideas, some that are analo- gous to abduction motifs and many that are not. If cul- tural elements are truly influential, they should appear in a variety that reflects their natural abundance to some extent and not cleave to the limited selection abduc- tion reports actually show. The discovery that those similarities maintain similar proportions from sample to sample marks yet another milestone. Such a discovery raises a further barrier to personal fantasy and cultural influence, since the reports seem even more at odds with the natural behavior of tale-tellers and their tales. Any solution for abductions must reckon with the testimony of the pro- portions. So far, so good. The persistent similarity of abduction reports qualifies them as interesting anoma- lies, but then leaves us hanging, uncertain what the anomalies mean. Similarities explained? Several reasons may account for the similari- ties of these three samples: 1) Abduction reports recount objective events in which different people undergo a similar experience. In this sense abductees report alien kidnappers largely single-minded in their purposes. 2) The reports describe genuine experiences, but not alien encounter events. The Old Hag phenom- enon described by David Hufford [10] includes a re- current phenomenology of sensations and images, but the Old Hag that enters the bedroom and oppresses the witness is probably not literal but a cultural overlay, a form prescribed by Newfoundland tradition to give meaning to an unsettling and widespread, probably universal, experience associated with sleep paralysis. Near-death experiences may owe their consistencies to shared characteristics of the dying brain. One pos- sible explanation for abduction, then, is an intersubjective experience, a pageant of the mind, but similar in its characteristics from one experient to an- other. 3) The similarities are real, but only on paper, and originate as impositions from investigators or cul- ture. No single explanation may suffice to explain ab- ductions, but combinations of cultural influences and investigators unwittingly leading a subject to say what they want to hear stir up a potent brew for error. Re- covered memories of sexual abuse and satanic ritual abuse caution that sincere people can describe and believe elaborate events that never happened. False memories emerge with alarming ease from susceptible subjects and spread their poison to others, until many testimonies borrowed from well-publicized anteced- ents and helped along by believing therapists create an illusion of consistency in reports of fictitious events. While abduction reports seem better and more subtly integrated than these accounts of abuse, the dif- ference is one of degree rather than of kind, and any case for genuine abductions must show them distinct from the scope of consistency possible in the false memory syndrome. The -elements in the table are vul- nerable to repetition because few of them are rare or obscure. Most of the elements are familiar from popu- lar accounts, meaning that claimants have reason to associate these motifs with abduction and incorporate them into their story, consciously or unconsciously, with spurious similarities the consequence. 4) Consistency is illusory; its appearance is merely an artifact of the reporting, investigation, and comparison processes. A long series of potentially ho- mogenizing influences handle the abduction story be- tween its origin and the comparison presented here. The abductee's expectations and internalized cultural influences, the investigator's biases and suggestions, the report's verbal approximations and distortions, the comparative study's methodological shortcomings and uncertainties—these matters conspire to smooth out the genuine differences and press forward a facade of illegitimate likeness. Would similarities be consistent? Would a fourth sample of reports bear out these similarities? Would evaluation by a disinterested third party arrive at similar percentages? Would even a new look at the old data lead to the same results? A soft- ness underlies the data and their treatment at every step, and the whole enterprise sinks into doubts. In all fairness I should say that I made no he- roic effort to jawbone the 1987 data to fit the 1995 results, or scrabble for match-ups at any cost. Yes, I gave the benefit of the doubt to findings that favored"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal June 1998 Page 15 similarity, especially where the element was less a straightforward description and more a matter of inter- pretation, but the fact remains that those similarities inhere in the data. The results could range from 0 to 100% and yet they failed to tear off in all directions. If the proportions were not rather close from sample to sample, no amount of data manipulation—and only wholesale cheating—could make up the difference. I may be guilty of self-deception or naivete, but I didn't cheat. Intriguing questions Even if the proportions are only approximately similar, they still raise intriguing questions. The simi- larities apply to samples that differ in several revealing ways. One difference worth noting is the variable num- ber of bedroom intrusions through the three samples. The circumstances differ, the content remains the same—a discovery that leaves explanations of abduc- tion as a sleep-related phenomenon in jeopardy. Another significant no-show is any apparent growth in reports of the popularized story elements (possibly excepting the reproductive examination). If media publicity supplies fantasizers and hoaxers with their raw material, they should pick up the most famil- iar elements for their yarns, and elements like paraly- sis, examination, and standard gray humanoids should increase over time at the expense of less popular alter- natives. This expectation has failed to materialize. The closeness of these proportions continues to surprise me. It seems altogether too good to be true. I watched the numbers pop out of the calculator with a growing sense of bemusement, knowing as I did the inexactitudes of the 1995 figures, and still welcome any explanation in terms of procedural error that any- one may offer. More comparisons needed Of course comparisons of this sort need to be extended and repeated if they are to have more than a superficial significance, and even if valid, this sort of evidence is not even in the same ballpark with a genu- ine artifact or a videotape of aliens caught in the act— two types of evidence that should not be at all out of the question if the phenomenon is in fact physical. For now, the numbers tease us with the question of what lies behind them, profundities or slip-ups? For now, we have no answers, only cause for wonder. References 1. Wright, Dan. Sorting entities.

Rowell Museum plans to expand Roswell, NM - With an anticipated 1998 visi- tor attendance of 310,000 and an increase in interest by motorcoach companies, the International UFO Museum and Research Center is facing a coveted busi- ness problem: the present facility on Main Street will be too small to adequately serve expected crowds in the very near future. The Museum has thus announced an ambitious 5-year expansion program, a vision recently fueled by the donation of an archive collection of UFO materials estimated to be worth $250,000. The collections were donated by George Fawcett and Bob Sabo. \"We want to become the clearinghouse for in- formation—not just the place that information is gath- ered, but to go to the next level by technically compil- ing, studying and distributing to the public this infor- mation,\" stated Deon Crosby, Museum director. The Museum Board of Directors evidently sees this as a tangible goal. They just signed an agreement to pur- chase 25 acres of property within the Buena Vida Sub- division on Hwy 70 west of Roswell. \"It will take several years to raise $7.5 million dollars, the estimated amount required to begin the first phase,\" Crosby says. \"But we believe in our people, and we believe in this organization.\" The management of the UFO Museum is working with several grant writers and plans are underway to begin a major fundraising program. Crosby says that leading com- puter companies will be contacted in an effort to foster partnerships that will provide the museum with the lat- est state-of-the-art equipment. The plan calls for three phases. The International UFO Museum is open 7 days a week. Admission to the museum is free."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Page 16 June 1998 MUFON UFO Journal Ufology profile Pascagoula's Charlie Hickson still interested in UFOs By J. R. Gillis, Mississippi Asst. State Director When you think of abductions, three cases stand above the rest, Barney/Betty Hill in 1961, Charles Hickson/Calvin Parker in 1973, and Travis Walton in 1975. What follows is Charlie Hickson's frank views not only on abductions but the entire UFO phenom- enon since October 1973. The interview was conducted by Don Hirth, Mississippi State Section Director, and myself. J. R.: Are you still working? CH: No, I am retired now, but I still do some part-time work. DON: Do you and Calvin still keep in touch? CH: I still see Calvin every now and then. J. R.: In 1983, you and William Mendez wrote UFO Contact at Pascagoula. Do you have plans for another book? CH: As a matter of fact, yes. I am working on a new book. It has no title right now and I hope to have it ready sometimes in 1998. That's all I will say for now. J. R.: Do you believe there is a government coverup, especially the Roswell incident of 1947? CH: Yes. J. R.: If the truth about UFOs were released to the public, what effect would that have on the public? CH: Well, in this day and time I don't think it would have as much of an effect as it would, say, twenty years ago. I think today that people have more knowl- edge of UFOs and abductions than before. J. R.: Has anyone from the mi 1 i tary or the gov- ernment ever told you not to speak about your experi- ences? CH: Nobody from the military or government has told me not to talk. In fact, it seems they have en- couraged me to speak. I might add, and I could be wrong, but over the years high-ranking military offic- ers have come to my house. They encouraged me to speak about my encounter. They claimed to be retired. Perhaps they were. I just don't know. DON: Do you think our government is slowly preparing mankind for contact with the aliens? CH: I believe they are. I honestly believe that. DON: In what way? CH: Well, like I said a minute ago, I think the military and government people want me to talk. I don't believe they stop any abductee from talking. They want the public to know what may be out there. J. R.: Why do you think Gulf Breeze, Florida, Charles Hickson (left) and J.R. Gillis (right) at UFO Awareness Day at Biloxi, MS, 1996. has been such a hot spot for UFO reports since Ed Walters released his UFO photos and story in 1987? CH: First of all, let me say this. I don't believe Ed Walters' story. I just don't believe it happened. Ed Walters knows my views on this. But I don't know. Everybody was so interested in UFOs and they thought Gulf Breeze might be a hot spot. I don't know about the other pictures people have of UFOs in Gulf Breeze. But the people that I've talked with there have not been taking pictures of UFOs. DON: Many other people since 1987 also have video and pictures of UFOs over Gulf Breeze, but you say they are not UFOs? CH: That is what I am saying, not in Gulf Breeze. No! J. R.: Some researchers say UFOs are extra- terrestrial. Others say they could be time travelers from our own future. A popular theory is that they come from another dimension or a parallel universe. Which theory do you favor? CH: I believe the aliens I've had contact with are from another world, not another dimension or par- allel universe. I also believe the other theories, but the aliens that Calvin and I encountered are from another world somewhere out there. DON: Many people have written best-selling books about their abduction experiences. Do you think some of these accounts are fiction and are only being published for financial gain? CH: Yes, we do have some of this. It only hurts what we are trying to do. For example, look at the book by Whitley Strieber, Communion. Being a writer al- ready, his book sales were down and he wrote an ab- duction story. It was a best seller. I heard him speak in"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal June 1998 Page 17 Washington, D.C., in 1987.1 believe that was the year. He and Phil Klass came close to blows. 1 heard Strieber tell Klass he made a million dollars from the book and laughed all the way to the bank. There are others, but this is the only one that 1 can think of right now. J. R.: In a newspaper interview in August of 1982 you revealed that the aliens have been in touch with you over the years. You said a strange \"power\" would be released all over the world. This would change the attitudes of people about each other, and it would stop this planet's self-destructive course. This even would set the stage for the aliens to come among us. Why do you believe these events never happened? CH: If you recall, some of these events did happen. Not long after that we no longer were faced with the threat of the Soviet Union. The world is dif- ferent than it was in in 1982. There is more peace on earth now than in 1982. DON: Have you received any other messages from the aliens that you wish to discuss? CH: Yes, but I am not prepared to talk about them at this time. J. R.: At our local MUFON meeting in Sep- tember, 1996, you said you believe that the aliens will appear in force before the year 2,000. By force, do you mean a military-type operation? CH: No, I don't believe it is going to be a take- over of Earth. If this was the case they could have done this years ago. The reason I think they will come in force is to show the entire world that they do exist. DON: Based on your own experience, do you consider the aliens our friends or foes? CH: I believe they are our friends. I don't think they mean us any harm. This is not to say that some aliens may not have another agenda. I have read about these things happening to many people around the world. I know that there are living beings on the craft that look almost like us. J. R.: Several years ago a Roper poll suggested that 3 to 4 million Americans may have been abducted. When you consider that over 90% of UFO reports can be explained, do you feel this figure is too high? CH: I can't be sure that this many people just in America have been abducted. Now don't get me wrong. I have great respect for Budd Hopkins and the work he is doing, and Budd is my friend. However, I don't believe that that many people have been abducted. DON: Since the 1980's most abductions now occur in the bedroom instead of on a lonely road and so forth. Why the change? CH: This is something I have never thought about actually. J. R.: Most researchers agree that abductions The Pascagoula Case What Jerome Clark calls \"the second most fa- mous UFO abduction case\" took place sometime after dark on Oct. 11, 1973, in Pascagoula, MS. Charles Hickson, 42, and Calvin Parker, 19, were fishing on the west bank of the Pascagoula River. They reported the following: A buzzing sound attracted Hickson, and when he turned around he saw a bluish light, then an object which floated above the ground. It opened up and \"three things\" came out of it. Hickson was floated into the object by two of the beings, where he was examined by a large \"eye.\" Parker recalls almost noth- ing after seeing the object; he apparently passed in and out of consciousness, but recalls being on the craft. Hickson and Parker were returned to the spot where they had been fishing. Hickson had not seen Parker while aboard the object, and he does not know if the object moved while he was aboard. Both men were badly shaken by the incident, discussed whether to report it, and decided to call Keesler AFB, which told them they did not handle UFO reports. They finally ended up at the sheriff's office. The local law enforcement authorities did not immedi- ately believe them, so Hickson and Parker asked to take lie detector tests. Sheriff Diamond placed the men in a room where they could be observed and tape re- corded without their knowing it. Listening to Hickson and Parker emotionally question each other and their own sanity, Diamond concluded they were not involved in a hoax. Two other witnesses were located who re- ported sighting an object at approximately the same time. The next day Hickson and Parker were inter- viewed at Keesler AFB. Soon investigators such as James Harder and J. Allen Hynek were in Pascagoula. All seemed to believe Hickson and Parker were telling the truth as they saw it. The author is Assistant State Director for Mis- sissippi. may start at an early age. However, with the repeater problem we have some people say they have been ab- ducted 50 times or more. What are your thoughts on this? CH: I know I was abducted as a child, and it has also happened to me several times since then. It is not up to me to say if it happens to everyone. Some of them may have been abducted that many times, but I am not saying this is true in every case. J. R.: After your 1973 encounter, did you con- sider reporting other encounters to the military, the media, or a UFO group? CH: I've kept the other encounters to myself."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Page 18 June 1998 MUFON UFO Journal I might have brought them up while on speaking en- gagements, but I would have to check my notes. I will say I just don't know what good it would do if I would have reported my other encounters. Don't get me wrong, I believe in MUFON and have many friends in MUFON. DON: What advice would you offer an abductee on how to cope with their abduction? CH: I'll be honest. I didn't know if I could live with it or not. I will tell you this. It got so bad at times I thought of killing myself. After much soul searching, I came to realize they had to contact me for a reason. I believe they contacted me to let the world know something or be there when it happens. I just don't know, but they didn't come here just to look at me. Perhaps I have a purpose or destiny. I got to the point where I could block it out of my mind and get on with my life. You can't keep it on your mind all the time. If you do you can't survive. So I have learned to block it out ever now and then. The key of being able to cope has been the support of my wife and family. They have stuck by me all these years and believe in me. Some of them have been with me during an en- counter. They know what I am going through. After my abduction I still had to get on with my life and support my family, regardless of what had happened to me. I had some people that wanted to make a movie and turn this into something big. I could have made a million dollars, but I couldn't do it. Again, the key for me has been the support of my family. J. R.: How did your abduction affect your reli- gious beliefs? For example, some abductees speak about reincarnation, and did you believe in it before your abduction? CH: Well, let me put it this way. I am a Bap- tist. I grew up a hard shell Baptist in Jones County on a farm. We believed you would go to either Heaven or Hell. But now, I believe in God because I am a Chris- tian, and God in all his glory made not only this planet but everything else. There is a God behind all of this, and it strengthens my belief in Him, just knowing He made other worlds with life on them. So meeting some- one from another world only made my faith stronger. The only thing I can say about reincarnation is that it is just something I strongly believe in. I can't say why; I don't know. However, I think I have lived many times before and I will live many times again. Then at some point I will be worthy to stand in the presence of my maker to be judged. DON: At our last MUFON meeting you said you later could recall under hypnosis seeing other be- ings behind a window observing you that looked hu- man. What year was the hypnosis, and could you de- scribe how the other aliens looked ? CH: The craft that picked Calvin and me up in 1973 sent two robots to carry us in the craft. I did re^ call years later, under hypnosis, that there were human looking aliens looking at me through a window. They were living beings just like us. Perhaps they sent ro- bots to take us into the craft because maybe they can't live in our atmosphere, or maybe they are afraid of getting a disease. You see, the world they live on is free of disease and war. Can you imagine a world like that? I think I would like to live there, wouldn't you? They looked just like a human being. I don't recall what year the regression was. I have done so many things since 1973 that I would have to check my notes to be sure. But there is one thing I wish to say. It made my experience easier to live with once I knew there were living beings on the craft. J. R.: Many abductees say the aliens put an implant somewhere on them to keep track of them. Have you ever thought you might have an implant? CH: At times I wonder if I do, but I just don't know. I do believe they know every move I make. They know what I am doing right now. So they must have some way of keeping track of me. J. R.: Do you have any physical evidence to suggest you may have an implant? CH: Well, the only thing I can say is doctors did find something behind my right eyeball. The doc- tor doesn't know if it is malignant or what it is. How- ever, the doctor did tell me that it is some kind of a little something with a point on it. I don't know if they can get it out or not. It could just be a mole, but when it first showed up on an X-ray years ago, the first thing I thought is, it could be an implant. DON: If you had it to do over again, knowing what you and your family went through, would you have reported your abduction? CH: This is a question I have asked myself many times. I don't know. I look at it two ways. If it hadn't of happened, my family wouldn't have went through some of the ordeals they went through. I am talking about people coming to our house all the time to talk to me, and being away from my family on speak- ing engagements. On the other hand, if I had it to do over again I just don't believe I could keep it to my- self. (DON is Donald Hirth, S.S.D. in Mississippi).

The object—a spherical shape six-to eight-feet in diameter—was a dull, reflectionless metallic gray, \"with some rust-colored spots.\" It resembled a Roman-like helmet, or an observatory, or a \"Jules Verne-like\" diving helmet, with a protruding ridge en- circling about one third of its top. On its side, about halfway from the top, was a curved, fish-like fin. LOG # 980301SE, CE-1, 1/28/98, E. Sebago, ME at 18:00 hours EST, 23:OOGMT, for 4 minutes. Index = 24.7% Investigator: Pamella Loffredo A 17-year-old witness and her younger brother were driving home to Standish, southward, and were near Sebago Lake when her brother spotted something strange in the sky. \"Is that an airplane?\" he asked. In front of them, diagonally to the right, was something strange, indeed. She pulled off the road, keeping the motor running and headlights and hazard lights on. About 100 feet off the ground (\"three telephone poles high\"), hanging and silently swinging back and forth in midair, were five lights. Four of them were amber-colored and triangular shaped. They defined the corners of a large (\"warehouse\" size) diamond configu- ration—a skewed rectangle. The fifth was a large, red, flashing, octagon- shaped light in the middle. The fifth light also appeared to be at one edge at some point, suggesting it was hang- ing below the surface plane of the other lights. Sur- rounding the diamond shape was a grayish, fog-like aura, shaped like an elongated octagon. The witness was stunned, but not afraid. \"My insides were tingling, and I felt \"lost in time.\" The two left the car to get a better look at the swaying object. In about three minutes, all lights suddenly turned off— the object's and the car's—at the same time. The ob- ject had moved, but it had not completely left; its lights came back on as it crossed a street some distance away. The car lights, too, came back on. They got back into the car to continue their trip homeward. She could not get the car to go over 45 miles per hour and could not keep it from swerv- ing. In about three minutes, her brother shouted, \"Holy s~t! It's following us!\" In the mirror, she could see a flashing red light coming upon them. It streaked over the car and away, out of sight.

Sheets While riding in a van from LaGrange, GA, to Anniston, AL, to join another group for a bingo game, several church members were dreading their drive by a poultry plant that always had a rank odor. As they passed by the plant, which was on a rise about 1,000 feet off the right side of the road, they noticed a light on top of the building and were curious why a light would be placed there. A friend of the main witness said it was \"not a light, but some flying thing!\" As if in response, the light swung down and headed toward them. \"Here it comes!\" she exclaimed. The flying \"light bulb\" followed their van as low as 12 feet over the road, normally 150 feet away, but sometimes moving within 50 feet. It was dishpan size at arm's length. Two of the riders thought they could make out a shadowy humanoid shape in the middle that was moving around inside, like an em- bryo in a womb. The group being frightened by the oddity, and the driver increased his speed and drove through an underpass. After emerging on the other side, they found the light was still with them. Some passengers fruit- lessly tried to duck and hide. Just before their road intersected with 1-20, the light \"took off up into the sky at a steep angle, trailing a tail or a streak [after-image?], and it kept going until it looked like a star, then 'clicked' off.\" They completed their journey, bingo game, and returned home without further incident. The next day, the main witness and her friend both complained of hurting, tearing eyes and \"dark circles down to her cheeks.\" The main witness claims her eyes were both brown before the incident, but she now has one blue and one green. She also suffered from migraine head- aches for two or three weeks afterward.

Call 1-888-836-8439. Reviewed by Dwight Connelly Stan Gordon has been bird-dogging the Kecksburg event for nearly 33 years—since he was 16 years old— and hasn't finished yet. I first met Stan when he con- tributed articles to Sh'look (the forerunner to the Jour- nal) when I was editor, and am well aware of his reputa- tion as a reliable researcher. Whether Kecksburg is another Roswell depends on who you ask. As articles in the MUFON UFO Jour- nal (September and October of 1989, and February of 1991) and other media have pointed out, something fell from the sky and landed in the woods near Kecksburg, PA, on Dec. 9, 1965. Gordon feels it had to be either a man-made device with some guidance con- trol capability or an extraterrestrial spacecraft. While witnesses were hard to find in 1965, Gor- don has located several in the intervening years, thanks in part to publicity from NBC's \"Unsolved Mysteries,\" which featured Kecksburg in a 1990 show, but mostly through the type of persistence that other researchers would do well to emulate. Many of these witnesses are in this video, giving viewers the opportunity to \"hear it from the horse's mouth.\" Randy Overly and Bill Bulebush, for example, provide a description of the object not long before it crashed, agreeing that it was going too slowly for a me- teor and that it changed direction before gliding into the woods. Numerous other witnesses, such as newspaper reporters Bob Gatty and Ernie Hoffman, describe the presence of a significant number of military personnel and vehicles. Eyewitnesses from the crash scene, such as vol- unteer fireman James Romansky, describe an object ap- proximately 8-12 feet in diameter and 10-15 feet long featuring \"geometrical designs like Egyptian hieroglyph- ics.\" Romansky added that he and the other four mem- bers of his search team observed that the object was acorn-shaped, had no visible seams, had no door, had no windows or portholes, and was made of metal. The front was embedded into the ground. He adds that two men in overcoats came to the site and ordered the vol- unteer firemen away. Dr. William Everett tells a story related to him by a colleague concerning a teenager who had been brought in by military personnel because his eyes had been strangely b.urned somewhere in Pennsylvania. Additional witnesses report seeing the object be- ing moved. Jerry Betters says he saw a copper colored acom-shaped object with hieroglyphics on the back of a . flatbed Army truck, while another witness reports what appears to be the same object, this time covered with a tarpaulin, whisked from the area by an Army flatbed trav- eling at a high rate of speed. The object is then traced to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, where a witness known only as Myron de- scribes delivering special bricks to a hangar, peeking inside, and seeing an acom-shaped object with a cloth like a parachute draped over the top. A ladder was placed against it. For years, this is as far as Myron went with his story. In this video, however, he says he is now will- ing to tell the whole story for the first time, because he is getting old and might not be around much longer. The \"whole story,\" according to Myron, is that he also saw what appeared to be a small body under a \"sterile pad.\" Sticking out from that pad was a left arm, brown and lizard-like, and a hand with three fingers. Even with this latest \"startling new revelation\" (I'm quoting the publicity sheet), there remained the ques- tion of whether the crash involved a Soviet satellite, Cosmos 96. This Soviet satellite apparently came down at 3:18 a.m. that same day in north-central Canada, ac- cording to the U.S. Space Command. If this is accurate, however, it could not have been the object which crashed at Kecksburg at 4:47 p.m. Likewise, speculation that the Soviet satellite somehow struck and damaged the Kecksburg object, causing it to crash, also lacks the nec^ essary coordination in timing. Clifford Stone and another former military officer claim they have seen official documentation that indi- cated the object had entered the Earth's atmosphere, and that it was not Soviet. Researcher Linda Moulton Howe has told Gor- don that one of her contacts, a former CIA operative, says the object was an extraterrestrial satellite that fell from orbit and crashed. Gordon provides background material from time to time in the video, but it was just not possible to in- clude all the interesting and significant events that his research has uncovered, including those noted in his Journal articles. Including updated copies of these ar- ticles with the video would provide helpful information for those not completely familiar with this case. Making the video longer is not the answer. But cutting portions of some of the interviews would have improved the overall production while providing time for additional background information. Even though this video is not everything we would like it to be, it does make a significant contribution to the field of ufology. Too bad we don't have witness videos this good for all the important cases."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal June 1998 Page 21 UFO MANIA The Lore and Legend of Ufology.

This nearest planet to the Sun can be found low in the WNW after sunset. Use binoculars to help locate the dim orange object. Jupiter (magnitude -2.7), in Pisces, now rises in the E about 11 p.m. in midmonth. The giant world lies near the gibbous Moon on July 14. It begins to retrograde eastward in the heavens on the 18th. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus (-3.9) can be seen low in the ENE, rising around 3:30 a.m. in mid-July. On the 2nd the gleaming planet shines 4 degrees above the orange star Aldebaran, and it is near the crescent Moon on the 21st. Mars (1.6), in Gemini, reappears at dawn late in July, rising at that time shortly before 4 a.m. in the ENE. Venus, to its upper left, closes to within 3 degrees of the dimmer red planet by month's end. Jupiter advances across the SE sky to a point high in the S at dawn. Saturn (0.2), moving from Pisces into Cetus, rises in the E about 12:30 a.m. in mid-month. By dawn the ringed world is visible in the ESE. The quarter Moon lies 2 degrees below the planet soon after moonrise on July 17. \"Face on Mars\": Under a revised policy by NASA to image cer- tain features of public interest, the Mars Global Surveyor recently photographed the so-called \"Face on Mars\" with a resolution more than ten times better than the best im- age of the feature from Viking Orbiter. Although the view- ing and lighting angles weren't exactly the same as Viking's, the face nevertheless appeared to be a heavily eroded natural mesa instead of the intelligently carved monument claimed by some devoted followers. The shadow contrast in the fuzzy Viking images had seemed to show the eyes, nose, and toothed mouth of a face. Later, MGS camera operators in their lab reversed the contrast in the new image to simulate the lighting in the Viking picture. Results reconfirmed the natural origin of the feature. Meteor Shower: The South Delta Aquarids can be watched near maximum on the morning of July 28 in a moonless sky. At that time southern observers may see about 20 mete- ors per hour, with a slightly lower count from northern latitudes. The July Aquarids are relatively slow, yellow- ish meteors with long paths emanating from the S.

Dear Mr. Connelly, Ha! 1 got a kick out of Bruce Maccabee's com- ments in the second paragraph of his \"Mexico City Video\" article in the April MUFON UFO.Journal. When he first watched the Aug. 6, '97 Mexico City video. Dr. Maecabee said, \"What immediately popped into my mind was a 'vi- sion' of a 1950's movie portrayal of flying saucers—the movie with rotating saucers that crash into the U.S. Capital building (Invaders from Space?)!\" As a film fan and collector, I can tell you that film is the 1956 B-movie classic Earth vs. the Flying Sau- cers, with stop-motion animation effects by the legend- ary Ray Harryhauscn. In addition to demolishing the Capital building, Harryhausen's saucers knock down the Washington Monument, crash into the Potomac River, and generally wreak havoc all over Washington D.C. This movie is a little gem. An interesting tidbit to those that study UFOs is that the opening credits of the film state the movie is based upon Flying Saucers From Outer Space by Maj. Donald E. Keyhoe. It seems the rights to Keyhoe's 1953 book were sold by the publisher, and Maj. Keyhoe spent much time and effort protesting the use of his name in the film's credits. He tried in vain to have his name removed. I can sympathize with Maj. Keyhoe. His serious research was turned into this wild entertainment vehicle. Nevertheless, as a 10-year-old boy sitting in the dark depths of the Jefferson Theatre, the spectacle on that big screen about blew me away! Dale Pequignot Dear Mr. Connelly, This is a note in appreciation of how interesting and informative the MUFON UFO Journal has become lately. It is like a dark cloud has been lifted from this aspect of MUFON. In the latest. May, issue the article by Beverly Trout about the weird \"ultralight\" UFO event was well worth reading to keep in mind the high strangeness as- pects of the UFO phenomenon. Your article on recent con- ferences was quite informative. The article on hypnosis by Anthony Constantino was very enlightening, and the consistency of the stories of the Allagash Abductions at- tests to his expertise. The articles on the Face were nicely reported, and the lack of sarcasm and ridicule therein was refreshing to see. The Lonnie Zamora article was also good reading. The article by Joe Lewels was great, and it was good also to get Dave Jacobs' rebuttal in the same issue: Keep up the good work. I feel like I'm finally getting my money's worth, and more, out of the Journal subscription.
