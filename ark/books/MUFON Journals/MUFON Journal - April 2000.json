There is recall of the event by Kelly without hypnosis, separate and unrelated witnesses, similar physical marks and effects among the wit- nesses, similar independent drawings of the UFO and the entities, and documented ground traces. In addi- tion, Kelly describes experiences both before and af- ter the main encounter which are similar to reports of other abductees. The beginning? Prior to Kelly's main encounter on Aug. 8, 1993, a possible precursor occurred in July of that same year. During a session of intense study of the Bible at home, Kelly says she challenged God to appear to her, saying, \"I want your pure presence.\" Suddenly she felt what she describes as \"an overwhelming pres- ence in the room.\" A surge of energy washed over her, \"and it seemed like something was being poured into my head\" during the 15 minutes when she was basically immobilized. When she emerged from the room where she had been studying, her husband Andrew was shocked by her disheveled physical appearance. He also reported that he had witnessed a flash of light that had filled the night sky. Yet there had been no lightning or thun- der, and he was frightened by the connection. Kelly says she also discovered that her unmarked Bible was missing. Preview of the main encounter On Aug. 8, Kelly and Andrew were in their auto on the outskirts of Belgrave South near Melbourne on their way to a friend's home. Andrew was driv- ing. Kelly saw through a break in the trees what ap-. peared to be a row of five or six unusual, unnatural orange lights on the ground surrounded by a fluores- cent orange haze. The object appeared to be perhaps 600 feet off the highway. Although the sun had gone down, Kelly could see that the object was circular in shape, the outside was rimmed with lights, and it was perhaps three car lengths wide. She was able to ob- serve the object for only two or three seconds, and Andrew had not seen it at all. Kelly immediately put the experience into a reli- gious framework, reasoning that the strange object encounter occurred here^X Location in Country Victoria where the main encounter took place. Editor's Note: Of the six known witnesses to this encounter, only Kelly Cahill has been willing to discuss it publicly, including writing a book and appearing before UFO groups. Our thanks to Kelly and Phenomena Research Australia (PRA) for sharing this case. Special thanks to PRA for allowing us to use the compelling images that accompany this account. must have been sent by God to acknowledge her devo- tion to Him and as an answer to her prayers. She turned around in her car seat, and in her mind said, \"Wait for me. I'll be back down this way in a few hours.\" When she told Andrew what she had seen, he said he doubted that she had observed anything unusual. The main encounter Kelly and Andrew left her friend's house at Monbulk for the return trip between 11:30 and 11:45 p.m. When they were about 15 kilometers from where Kelly had seen the orange lights previously, she suddenly saw \"this thing hanging above the road up ahead. It was just a light at first, then it looked like a blimp. As we got closer to it, and I could focus, there it was! The same"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 AprU 2000 MUFON UFO Journal orange lights!\" Kelly could now see that the orange lights were really windows, and she could see figures standing behind portals, silhouetted in a contrast of black shadow against orange light. The object was hover- ing at about twice the height of the trees. \"Andrew! Look at that thing!\" said Kelly. Andrew replied, \"I. see it. I see it. Shit it's big!\" As they were about to go under the object, it suddenly shot off to the left. They had observed the object for about a minute. Kelly was certain it was a UFO, but Andrew com- mented guardedly, \"I saw a big thing with windows and lights. That doesn't mean I saw a UFO. It could have been something the government is working on. Anyway, whatever it is, it's got nothing to do with us.\" As they continued their drive, a huge bright light suddenly appeared in the middle of the road. As sud- denly as the light had appeared, it disappeared. \"But things seemed different,\" says Kelly. The speed of the auto had abruptly slowed, and they seemed to be on a different section of the highway. Suddenly Kelly's heart was no longer pounding, and she felt very relaxed., She was also perplexed by the light. \"When I say the light disappeared, it wasn't like someone turned it off. It was as if someone turned me off...My eyes seemed to have instantaneously dark-adjusted.\" An- drew, who had been as animated as Kelly just a few seconds before, now seemed sluggish, somewhat dazed, and distant, but again refused to acknowledge that they had seen a UFO. The smell of vomit Neither Kelly nor Andrew had the energy for much argument, but Kelly suddenly noticed the smell of vomit in the car. Andrew also smelled the annoying odor, but a search of the car and their clothing never revealed the source of the odor., Kelly did not think she had vomited, but did have a dull ache in her stom- ach that seemed to reach all the way to her shoulders. Andrew reported a similar feeling. Kelly compared it to a laparoscopy, where the patient is filled with gas so a laparoscope can be placed in the body to view the insides, a procedure done on her years be- fore. She also felt she had blacked out at some point during the encounter. When she and Andrew arrived home, it was 2:30 a.m. If they had left the friend's house between 11:30 p.m. and midnight, the trip had taken about three hours instead of the usual 1 1/2 hours. When Kelly went to the toilet, she noticed she was bleeding profusely, \"and it wasn't my time.\" She describes the blood as bright red, \"not period blood.\" and it was \"unusually profuse.\" She also reports that she discovered a small perfect equilateral triangle, very red, with sharp lines, under her navel. Although it ap- peared to have been burned into her, she experienced no pain in that area. Kelly went to bed about 3 a.m. When she awoke the next morning she remembered details of an extraordi- nary dream involving a UFO and entities. In her dream she recognized one of the beings as someone familiar and trusted, although she did not know who he was. \"I got the idea,\" she explains, \"that he was like the keeper of my soul.\" On the table before him was a Bible, which Kelly recognized as one of hers. The being told her that she could come with him, but she had to leave the Bible behind, or she could just leave with the Bible. This made Kelly distrust the entity, and she thought that anyone who expected her to give up her Bible must be Satanic. As if the entity could read her thoughts, he handed her the Bible, but seemed saddened by her decision. Kelly reports that two days after the dream Andrew came into the house carrying the missing Bible. He had found it on the floorboard on her side of the car. She was mystified, since she never took her Bibles out of the house. Health deteriorates Although the bleeding had decreased, it had been continuing for three weeks, and she was not feeling well. She had also become extremely sensitive to noise, and began to get migraine headaches, something which had never occurred prior to the encounter. She also had stom- ach cramps, and had lost 22 pounds. Kelly was hospi- talized, and the doctors told her she had a uterine infec- tion. She says she did not connect her physical condi- tion with the UFO encounter. On Sept. 6, 1993, Kelly says she had the first night visitation. The entity was a tall black figure wearing a full-length hooded cloak. The face was black with large red eyes which did not glow, but were dull red. She had been shocked into full alertness by what felt like a tre- mendous vacuum pulling energy out of her, and had re- ceived a telepathic message to not be afraid of what was about to happen. Kelly says the first thought she had was that this was a \"soul vampire.\" The entity stared directly into Kelly's eyes, terrifying her. Suddenly it disappeared, and Kelly ran to Andrew's room. Other things were also occurring, according to Kelly. Electrical devices would go off and on for no apparent reason, and the car starter would turn over by itself. She says she was receiving shocks from items that do not conduct electricity, such as wood and stones. This did not stop until the fourth night visitation in January of"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal April 2000 PageS Gidts wet o dofker orange of wild appearance, entitling diffused pole orange light Unable to tell whether this was actually rays of light 01 luminescent solid © 1'R.A This line htr« could ban been convex or concave Actual colour was pale luminescent blue somewhere between baby bbe and oquo Approximate vale of p»rvm to object . ©PRA Three independent sketches of the UFO were done by Kelly (left), Jane (center) and Glenda (right). (Copyright PRA) 1994, a period of about seven months. Didn't know about UFO effects Still, Kelly did not connect all of this to her experi- ence with the UFO. \"If you would have quickly come to that conclusion,\" she explains, \"it's probably be- cause you are familiar with UFO events. But at that time I did not know that seeing a UFO could cause these things.\" Kelly had, in fact, apparently forgotten her encoun- ter with the UFO. During a visit to a friend's house on Sept. 16,1993, Andrew mentioned what they had seen along the road, and Kelly rebuked him, saying she had not seen anything like that. However, she also realized that Andrew would not joke about this topic, so she was puzzled. She began trying to recall the trip to Monbulk on Aug. 8, and eventually did remember the lights on the way to her friend's house and the blimp-like object on the way back, but no details of the encounter. Two weeks later, however, on Oct. 1, Kelly and Andrew were again going to Monbulk to visit Kelly's friend, traveling the same road as before, but this time in daylight. Kelly was in high spirits until they passed the area where she had seen the UFO. At that point she blurted out, \"This would be a good place for a UFO to land.\" A sudden recall Suddenly she experienced extreme depression as she recalled the encounter. \"In an instant,\" she says, \"I knew what had happened that night.\" She felt devas- tated. Kelly explains, \"The memory flashes were so clear and sharp that I don't see how I could have for- gotten them.\" These flashes of memory were only from the first portion of her missing time, however: stop- ping the car, getting out, reaching into the car to pick up her handbag, and seeing beings with the big red eyes. When Kelly had finished her reconstruction of the missing time, she had assembled only the first ten to fifteen minutes, and there is still about an hour that she does not recall. She says she is not sure she even wants to recall the missing time, \"because the first 15 min- utes is bad enough.\" The investigation Kelly was now determined to report what she had experienced, despite Andrew's objections, so she be- gan calling science departments at universities. None was interested, except to suggest that she see a psy- chiatrist. When she called the Civil Aviation Author- ity, they put her in contact with a UFO research group in Melbourne and Bill Chalker in Sydney. Since Chalker was some distance away, he suggested she work with John Auchettl of Phenomena Research Aus- tralia (PRA) in Melbourne. She contacted Auchettl on Oct. 4 and told him what she could consciously remember, and agreed to undergo hypnosis. Two attempts were made, utilizing two dif- ferent therapists, but neither session was successful. Kelly explains that she is apparently not a good hyp- notic subject, refusing to give up control. On Oct. 14, five weeks after the first night visit and ten days after contacting PRA, Kelly reports experi- encing another such visit. In analyzing this visit, Kelly came to the conclusion that the entity \"was after my spiritual essence, which was somehow connected to my body.\" Still another night visitor On Oct. 23, while at a friend's house, Kelly says she was again visited, but before the actual visit she heard a commanding male voice say, \"Go and have a look underneath the car.\" Since it was dark, she did not do it. After being asleep for an hour and a half, Kelly awoke to find a black creature leaning over her with its head near her stomach. The creature, totally naked, was tall and had a bulging belly, long lanky limbs, an elongated and misshapened head, no genitals, and bulging (not red) eyes. Kelly sat bolt upright in bed and screamed.

The creatures were described as having red glowing eyes. (Copyright PRA) she screamed, says Kelly, the creature jumped back from her and seemed badly frightened. The creature vanished, and Andrew woke up to find a sweating Kelly sitting upright in bed, babbling, \"They told me not to be afraid...that a man was going to come and kiss me!...It was going to kiss my navel, not my face.\" On their way home the next day, Kelly told Andrew about the voice which had told her to check under the car. Andrew rolled his eyes in disbelief. They did not check under the car, but later they heard a clanking noise and scraping under the car. Andrew checked and discovered that the flywheel cover had come loose and was barely attached to the car. Kelly says she finally got Andrew to laugh about it. Meanwhile, the investigation by PRA was continu- ing. Kelly had consciously recalled that there was an- other car present during the encounter, and that she had observed two people standing in front of it hold- ing hands, so PRA put carefully-worded ads in the newspaper in an attempt to see if those in the other car would come forward. Other witnesses located On Nov. 17 PRA received a phone call. The male (a business manager) and two females (one was the man's wife, and the other was a health professional) in the other car had been located. Without knowing what Kelly had reported, the two women, Glenda and Jane, described events and drew sketches of the entities and the craft very similar to Kelly's. The male had no con- scious recall of the encounter, but was able to give corroborating details under hypnosis. In addition, both females reported past dreams, visi- tations, and gynecological problems similar to Kelly's. The two women also had small triangles under their navels, as well as marks on the insides of their legs. Glenda had ligature marks on her left ankle, as well as a mark on her thigh. Both quite clearly remembered being restrained flat on their backs on tables. Kelly did not know this information at the time, since PRA did not allow her to meet with the other witnesses, nor was she immediately told what they had reported. The other witnesses also recalled a third car, which Kelly had not been able to see, but which ap- parently illuminated the car that she did see. The third vehicle? The occupant of this third car has not been located- at least not so this person could be interviewed. How- ever, in September of 1996, the editor of Who Weekly, a national newsstand magazine in Australia, received a letter from a woman who suspected her husband had been the unidentified male driver of the third vehicle. The woman, who signed her name \"Bev,\" said that she and her husband had read about the Cahill case, and that they thought there was a possibility that the husband had been involved. \"Bev,\" seeking to find definite evidence that her hus- band was involved in the same incident, asked if any of the witnesses had reported seeing a unique design"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal April 2000 Page? Photos of the left ankles of both Glenda and David showed similar ligature marks. on the back of her husband's vehicle. She said the bright design was on the protective cover of the spare wheel, which was mounted on the right rear of her husband's vehicle. The design, not commercially available, was of a red reflective material shaped like a dragon, with the word \"boat\" under it. The woman also included a set of photos which she said showed marks on her husband's body which they thought came from the encounter. She said her hus- band, \"David,\" was employed with the Victorian Gov- ernment Law Department, which prevented him from coming forward publicly, although he might later on. In the letter, the woman said her husband did not want to believe that something had happened, and that it had been \"three years of disbelief and denial.\" She said \"David\" had unsuccessfully attempted to get in touch with UFO researchers to see if they could ex- plain what had happened, then decided that the situation \"was too unusual to explain to anyone and it would be far more beneficial to let the matter rest. It was not until last week that we read your positive and balanced article that we (at my insistence) decided we should write to you, in support of the others and their case and look into this situation again.\" The mention of the red dragon design proved especially interesting to Auchettl. All the witnesses had been required to indepen- dently submit written reports regarding what they had seen, and Jane, who was in the sec- ond vehicle, had mentioned observing some- thing that looked like a red dragon flying past their car as they were driving. This had made little sense to Auchettl at the time, but took on added significance as a result of the woman's letter describing the design on the back of her husband's car. Just as interesting as the red dragon were the color photos, which showed marks on the husband's ankle and inner thigh which matched Glenda's marks in detail. This was significant independent evidence, because photos of the marks on Glenda had not been released to the public at the time the woman's letter was received. The PRA team, aided by independent ana- lysts, did an extensive analysis of the site where the witnesses said the UFO had been sitting, including specialized aerial photog- raphy. Kelly assisted during two of the 11 inspections, pointing out where she was, where the UFO was, where the entities were, and where the other auto and witnesses were. A computer grid image of the magnetic anomalies at the site showed a semicircular impression which matched the shape of the craft, as reported by the wit- nesses. PRA also found that the ground had been baked under high pressure, and that there was a triangular mark in addition to the semicircular magnetic anomaly. These traces corresponded to the witnesses' descrip- © PRA This printout of the magnetic anomaly shows the shape of a crescent or semicircle, which was the shape and location of the UFO described by the witnesses."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PageS April 2000 MUFON UFO Journal tions of the object and where it was located. Marks in the formation about 18 feet apart corresponded to the tripod drawn beneath the UFO in sketches by two of the wit- nesses (Kelly did not include a tripod in her sketch). The site investigation also revealed that the whole area was laced with sulfur. A chemical called pyrene, often found in coal lodes, was present, though it should not have been. Tannic acid contained in some sort of coating was present in the semi- circle, but not elsewhere. The vegetation in the crescent area showed signs it had been subjected to abrasion. Kelly was asked not to read UFO litera- ture while the investigation was being con- ducted. Looking back, she says that this had the good result of keeping her uncon- taminated, but the bad result of her not noticing or reporting certain key things— such as the triangle beneath her navel—because she did not know enough to associate these things with the UFO encounter. In October, following her detailed recall of the Aug. 8, 1993, main encounter, Kelly began to also recall an incident that had occurred in the fall of 1991. \"I kept getting this strong flash that made me feel that I'd pre- viously experienced the energy I had felt on the field,\" she explains. In the first dream, she had felt she al- ready knew the tall being who handed her the Bible, and during the main encounter she had the feeling that she already knew that the creatures were evil, so there Foliage in the crescent-shaped landing area showed signs of abrasion.

Kelly explains that she now recalled that the en- counter had taken place in Lalor, a northern suburb of Melbourne where she and Andrew had lived for a time. She was 24 years old and nine months pregnant with her son James. This series of incidents over a period of two to three weeks began with a vivid, bizarre dream in which Kelly was forced by a stem female voice to make her way into an hour glass-shaped object made of flesh, and through a small opening into a chamber filled with liquid. She likened the episode to going back into the womb, but fit it into her then religious thinking of \"being bom again,\" not as something related to UFOs. After discussing this dream with her friend Silvana, they went into the room where Andrew was sitting. Suddenly they heard what appeared to be the swishing of helicopter blades. Kelly went to the sec- ond story veranda to see what was outside, and there was a black helicopter hovering 30 to 40 feet from the house. No markings The helicopter had no markings and no lights that Kelly could see, but there were \"at least\" three figures inside, she said. It reminded her of a police or military heli- copter. After she was subjected to the wind and \"terrible noise\" of the helicopter for about 15 minutes, it left. Again, Kelly thought the incident was very strange, but did not realize at the time that black heli-"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal April 2000 Page 9 copters are sometimes associated with UFO experi- ences. The more significant experience at Laylor occurred on Oct. 14 when Kelly woke up in the morning flat on her stomach (nine months pregnant) with her sheets soaking wet from her broken waters. \"I couldn't un- derstand how I could be lying like that,\" she says. \"It would have been practically impossible for me to get into that position. It was as if I had been dropped on the bed like that.\" When she went to the bathroom she noticed that her nightdress was inside out. She could not remember going to bed, recalling that her last recollection was of being fully dressed and sitting by herself in the lounge room. She went to the hospital, and James was deliv- ered without incident. However, he was born with a number of pea-sized nodules under the skin on both sides of his neck. Soon after his birth, Kelly also developed these nodules, which started on her arms and spread a few inches each month down her body. These were in- flamed and very painful. Those on James, however, did not spread nor cause any particular problem. He was tested by doctors for various diseases, but nothing was diagnosed. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Kelly, however, saw her health deteriorate, and she spent about three days a week in bed. She also began losing clumps of hair, causing her to fear she had can- cer. Doctors assured her she did not have cancer, but did diagnose her as having Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, which has been reported by a number of other abductees. She also was sent to the hospital with stomach pains, and a blood test indicated very high white cell count. She was quickly operated on for appendicitis, but the doctor found her appendix was okay. However, her abdominal cavity was extremely inflamed, which Kelly blames on the nodules that were spreading on her body. These nodules kept her in pain until after her 1993 encounter, nearly two years later, after which they be- gan to recede and finally disappear. Unfortunately, they were replaced by migraine headaches, as noted earlier. Looking back at the experience at Lalor, she recalled that she had observed \"scoop marks\" in her calves, but had thought they were caused by her pregnancy. \"Based on what I now know,\" she says, \"all these little things seem to add up to something that looks like an abduction experience.\" A final visitation? Kelly's last nighttime visitation occurred in Janu- ary of 1994. She slept with a light on, but dreamed that the light bulb went out, and she felt something grab her right hand. She resisted at first, but then gave in. Immediately she woke up, and a tall black entity was standing next to the bed with its head turned away. This time Kelly was not as shocked or frightened, so she just looked at the being until it disappeared, then she went back to sleep. The next morning she checked the light bulb, and it had blown. She also discovered that her mother's rings, a diamond and a sapphire, that she wore on her right hand were missing. They have not been seen since. Kelly's experiences add up to the classic abduction scenario, but without the independent witnesses and the ground traces, it would be just another story by a woman claiming to have been abducted—one of thou- sands of such reports which are routinely dismissed by debunkers. By George A. Filer Director, MUFON Eastern Region UFO reportedly lands in Malaysian village The following information appeared in the Malay- sian newspaper The Star of Kuala Lumpur on March 5 and in The Straits Times on March 6. A large object emitting rays of light reportedly de- scended from the sky and landed in marshland near the village of Kampung Gobek, Malaysia, at about 3 .a.m. local time on March 3, leaving some 1,000 vil- lagers in a state of high suspense. Kampung Gobek is located in the Kelantan prov- ince on the Malay peninsula just south of Malaysia's border with Thailand. \"The lights from the object came in intervals, simi- lar to lightning, but there was no sign of rain,\" said eyewitness Mohamad Mat Diah, 51. \"The light from the object was very bright, and the rays bathed the in- side of my house.\" Suspecting that something very strange was happening, he ran outside and \"saw the object hovering over the marshland for several min- utes,\" he said. The next morning, Mohamad Mat Diah found an area about 100 meters from his house where, it ap- peared, something very heavy had settled onto the ground, though no object remained. He said there was a \"Y-shaped depression\" measuring about 16 by 49 feet). Nearby was another group of deep depressions, one large and \"crescent-shaped\" as well as three cir- cular holes, each about one meter in diameter and one meter apart."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Page 10 April 2000 MUFON UFO Journal Ufology Profile Kelly Cahill a changed woman Kelly Cahill is not well known in this country, but that is slowly changing. Those attending the MUFON 1999 International Symposium had the op- portunity to hear her speak at both a regular session and a special luncheon session, and these MUFON members have in turn told others about her. She also recently did a short U.S. tour, arranged by Kentucky MUFON, speaking in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Cali- fornia. Kelly's UFO encounter is at least as impressive as any of the \"classics,\" including the Travis Walton ab- duction, the Betty and Barney Hill abductions, and the Pascagoula abductions. In fact, her case is better docu- mented than any of these. (See article in this issue). While the substantial documentation for her case is unusual, the human side fits the pattern all too well: woman leads reasonably normal life, woman reason- ably happy, woman has encounter with UFO, woman divorces, and woman never the same again. Despite the strong indications that an abduction took place, Kelly will not fully acknowledge that she was abducted: \"I don't know for sure I was abducted. I don't know if it was aliens or the military or what.\" And she adds meaningfully, \"I did not have a pleasant experience.\" Part of this reluctance to acknowledge what seems to be apparent has to do with her efforts to put the incident behind her. \"The missing hour is not impor- tant to me anymore,\" she says, not very convincingly. \"I was obsessed with it for awhile, but I have to get away from it or I'll go crazy.\" Kelly acknowledges that, alien or not, the experi- ence has had a profound effect on her life. Married at 17 to a native of Lebanon, she and her husband, An- drew, were the \"happy\" parents of three children. \"We had gotten past the stage of fighting and the various adjustments that come with a marriage,\" she explains. \"We were getting along well.\" One adjustment they had to make was the differ- ence in religious practices. Andrew is Muslim, and Kelly became seriously involved with Christianity when she was 21, four years into their marriage. \"An- drew was not especially upset because I did not be- come a Muslim,\" she explains. \"When I became a practicing Christian he was just glad that I had found God. We respected each other's religions.\" Andrew was not quite as understanding when it came to UFOs, however. Even though he participated in Kelly's encounter, he did not want to talk about it, nor would he participate in the investigation of the inci- dent. Andrew tried to convince Kelly that the sighting had just been her imagination, and that she should for- Kelly Cahill, one of the key witnesses in the 1993 Australian abduction case, poses with ufologist Stan Friedman at the MUFON 1999 International Symposium, where both were speakers. get about it, but added, \"It's not good to mess around with this business. You don't know what they are. Maybe it's nothing to do with the government; they could be demons for all you know, and the more you mess with them, or even think about them, the stron- ger they get.\" Kelly blames Andrew's viewpoint on his Lebanese background. \"In his village everyone is so supersti- tious,\" says Kelly. \"They have these stupid rituals. Everything is seen as demonic, but Andrew is not as bad as most people in rural Lebanon.\" Whatever the origin of the UFO, Kelly says that the experience changed her religious beliefs. \"My whole world was the Bible,\" she explains. \"I had been taught that UFOs didn't exist. This experience corrupted my religion. You wouldn't believe how much I read the Bible before this experience. After the incident, I quit reading it, and this really upset Andrew.\" After the incident, Kelly says she wanted to read about UFOs, but had been asked by John Auchettl of Phenomena Research Australia, which was conduct- ing the investigation, not to read any UFO literature until they had finished, a suggestion which she fol- lowed. Kelly also went through a period in which she felt she had been selected for the experience because she was special in some way. \"I don't feel that way about it now,\" she says. \"I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.\" Other incidents in her life seem to con- tradict this idea, however. Now Kelly finds herself a different person. \"I've certainly learned more about the world,\" she explains, sounding somewhat dissatisfied with the knowledge."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal April 2000 Page 11 \"You can't go back to the way you were.

Has the book helped her deal with the experience? \"Well, I've changed since I wrote the book,\" she says pointedly. \"As I said, I'm certainly not as naive as I was.\" Family observes strange object By William I. McNeff, Minnesota State Director On Nov. 20, 1999, a family living in Makinen, MN, was watching a video when the oldest son (20) no- ticed a bright red light in the southern sky. When the father, Terry (44), looked out the window and saw that it was a strange object, he urged everyone to go out- side to get a better look. The family estimated the brightness as about three or four times that of Jupiter. After watching the object for three to four min- utes, one of them got a camera and binoculars. With the binoculars, the object appeared to Terry to be chang- ing shape. At one time it appeared to be four lights forming a square, then changed to include about 50 lights in a straight line centered between the four lights. \"I thought this was really weird,\" Terry said. This prompted him to go inside and dial 911. While he was inside, the object stopped for a minute or so and began. to pulsate. When Terry came back outside, the object began to move again toward the north. The object moved south to north and finally disappeared over the horizon (trees). The family estimates they observed the object for about eight minutes. They managed to take pictures of the object with two cameras. One of the cameras was new and unfa- miliar, and the shutter may have been held open, as the images on the pictures look \"wiggly.\" Some hunt- ers in the area also witnessed the object. Visibility was about 10 miles with high overcast clouds. No natural objects seem to fit the description. While an advertising blimp might fit, it is believed these are not flown over sparsely populated northern Min- nesota. Conclusion: Unidentified. Investigated by FIT Dr. Stephen Hero and FI Director Craig Lang. Pilot reports object on radar then off, but still visual Editor's Note: The following story was sent to MUFON by John Harrod of S. Lake Tahoe, CA. He was a heavy equipment operator, working from 1983 to 1999 in the High Sierra. He says he saw \"many fantastic natural phenomena, but just one UFO, and it was clearly, positively, dramatically, shockingly un- natural.\" But his reason for contacting MUFON was to tell about his father's sighting as a pilot: By John Harrod My father, Hershel Harrod, was a pilot for United Airlines from 1965 until he retired in 1996. Once he returned home with a wild story about seeing a UFO. My father is a very humorless and pragmatic individual who never had much interest in gags or jokes, so I was interested to hear his tale of seeing a UFO once in 1970. I was 14, and he came back from a flight and told me this story: \"We were enroute from Chicago to LaGuardia when ground control advised us to be on the lookout for a large object that was on their radar and had been ob- served by several airliners in the area. As we got closer to the object we picked it up on our screen. We had a United vice-president aboard, a captain, co-pilot (my dad), second officer (engineer), and four stewardesses, all of whom saw the object. There were two other airliners watching the thing when we got visual on it. \"It had been doing high-speed erratic maneuvers, but was stationary when we got it on radar. Then it started pacing us, staying several miles ahead and to the right, then ground control asks us, is it still there? It just went off of our screen! Right out of the MIDDLE of the screen. We had it in visual contact, as did an- other aircraft, but it just blinked off of everyone's ra- dar, one by one. We were most interested in it at that point. \"Then it shot across our flight path to our port side, and it was so fast you almost couldn't see it, just a blur. Then it paced us for a while on our port side. It was a large sphere, maybe a hundred feet across or bigger. It had a green light on top and a red light on the bottom, both lights alternately tracing a path around the perimeter of the body of the craft, the green doing a half-circle across the top, left to right, the red doing an arc across the bottom half, right to left. \"Then it shot at us at perhaps 2000-3000 miles per hour, passing under us to our left perhaps several hun- dred yards below us. The shock wave rattled the air- plane violently, as if we had hit a huge air pocket.\" About a week after my father came home with this story, a letter marked \"Confidential\" came in the mail"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Page 12 April 2000 MUFON UFO Journal from the Air Force. My father was out of town on a flight. I was very curious to know if it had anything to do with his sighting, so I opened it. (I knew he wouldn't care.) It requested that my father attend a meeting in Man- hattan in a week to discuss the sighting, and it speci- fied that he was not allowed to discuss the sighting with ANYONE, including family. This confirmed to me that he had seen what he said he did. Then the capper in 1993.1 was watching a special, a Sixty-Minutes sort of thing on UFOs, and there was one segment that went as follows: in 1970, two Air Force fighter pilots were scrambled over NORAD in the Rockies to check out a large UFO which was in NORAD airspace and not responding to identification requests. Both of these pilots, since retired, were able to get fairly close to the thing before it took off at a' \"zillion\" miles an hour. They said (and it was another of those getting-the-willies moments) that it was a large sphere with a green and red light, both moving in a semicircle around it, alternating left to right. They saw exactly what my father saw, same year, same continent, just 1800 miles away. This was the story he told us, my mom and me. I was very surprised, and as it was extremely out of char- acter for him to make up a story like this, I believed he had seen SOMEthing. UFOs in TV advertising By Dan Wright Deputy Director, Investigations Over the past several years in particular, I've be- come increasingly aware of the number of advertised products and services employing a UFO or alien theme in televised commercials. Saucers levitating a Pepsi machine or aliens preferring Budweiser over another brand-always employing humor in the message. In January 1999, my wife Shawn and I began to keep a list. While we don't watch network TV to any extent and so may have missed some, here are the nationally- based advertisers who used that theme during calen- dar year 1999, appearing below in the order that we viewed them: Victoria's Secret; Pizza Hut; Progressive Auto In- surance; Chili's Restaurant; Polaroid; U.S. Postal Ser- vice (for Priority Mail); DirecTV; Solaman, Smith, Barney; AT&T (for 1-800-Collect); Gateway Comput- ers; Owens-Corning; Quallcom (cellphones). The USPS entry in the list is especially curious, be- ing a federal agency. With the many potential prod- ucts, perhaps a dozen nationally run commercial en- dorsements of a UFO reality should not be surprising. The UFO PRESS UFOs and Reincarnation Soul Samples by Dr. R. Leo Sprinkle, Granite Publishing, Columbia, NC, 256 pgs, $21.95. Reviewed by Matthew J. Graeber Dr. R. Leo Sprinkle's pioneering researches and longtime professional care for UFO experiencers is legend in most UFO circles-as are the many injustices that this gentle man of science endured (while in academia) for openly proclaiming his professional and personal interest in the UFO enigma and reincarna- tion. In his landmark book Soul Samples, Dr. Sprinkle's unique investigative skills, insights, and concepts serve to create a bold new kind of ufological inquiry which is rich in theory and supported by scientific data. Soul Samples is enlightening, provocative, heuristic read- ing, and opens the door to much deeper contemplation concerning the UFO experiences' profound impact upon the individual and mankind in general. Dr. Sprinkle's extraordinary explorations of the UFO connection with reincarnation is must reading for the truly objective researcher as well as inquisitive UFO experiencers who would care to learn more about their contact with advanced intelligences from another world, time, and dimension. In Soul Samples Dr. Sprinkle introduces us to his belief that the significance of reincarnation and UFO contacts is that humanity is evolving from planetary persons to citizens of the cos- mos. Are abductions real? The Abduction Enigma by Kevin D. Randle, Russ Estes, and Dr. William P. Cone. Forge Books, 416 pages, $25.95. Reviewed by Dwight Connelly There is plenty not to like about this book, but the authors have done a lot of research, and they do pro- vide information and ideas that need to be seriously considered. Randle, of course, is an experienced main- stream UFO investigator, so when he flatly rejects all abduction reports, this has to be significant. It would be unfair to label him as a debunker, though this is in many ways a debunking book. Crediting Phillip Klass with two of the photos in the book will do nothing to enhance Randle's prestige-except with Klass. Despite the title, abductions are not an enigma to Randle and his co-authors. Co-author Estes, by the way, is a documentarian who has interviewed a re- ported 150 abductees, and co-author Dr. Cone is a psy-"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal April 2000 Page 13 chologist. The basic thrust of this book is that \"there is not a single shred of physical evidence that alien abductions are taking place other than the tainted testimony of the abductees.\" Period. This view certainly contradicts what the majority of UFO researchers seemingly ac- cept, and it certainly does not reflect the contents of mainstream UFO publications. This, of course, does not mean that Randle is necessarily wrong, but it does indicate how far he is from the current thinking of most leading ufologists. No respect The authors show no respect for either the abductees or the researchers who deal with abductees. \"Abductees, as a group,\" say Randle and his co-au- thors, \"show a high percentage of individuals with gender identity problems, sexual dysfunction, dysfunc- tional families, and broken lives,\" and these things lead them to the abduction researchers/therapists. The ab- duction researchers/therapists, in turn, use the flawed technique of hypnosis to lead these dysfunctional \"abductees\" into detailed accounts of abductions which never occurred, they claim. The reward for the abductees, they say, is attention and membership in abduction groups. The basic question is whether the authors can back up these strong allegations. In condemning the re- searcher/therapists, Randle and Company claim that their basic arguments have been made by the research- ers themselves. He quotes Dr. David Jacobs, for example, as say- ing, \"Unless properly versed in the problems these mental procedures can create, the hypnotist can easily fall into the trap of accepting fantasies and confused thinking as reality.\" Jacobs has been critical of his fellow researchers, including Harvard's Dr. John Mack, saying that Mack was trained as a therapist, not as an investigator. Mack, in turn, is quoted as saying, \"It seems to me that Jacobs, Hopkins, and Nyman may pull out of their experiencers what they want to see.\" Thus the major researchers seem to have little re- spect for the techniques of their colleagues, though they do have much more respect for the abductees. This, then, is the basic point of the book: the abductees are dysfunctional or have some sort of dis- order, the therapists/researchers lead them into relat- ing accounts of abductions that fit the preconceived ideas of the researchers/therapists, and this is the sum total of the abduction experience. The authors spend much of the 416-page book try- ing to show how hypnosis is not a reliable method of getting information, as well as how people can be led to believe they had experiences that they did not have. Randle and his colleagues compare the experiences of both accusers and the accused in sex molestation cases and Satanic abuse cases to show how emotional fanta- sies can be accepted as truth, concluding that emo- tional statements made in hypnotic sessions about ab- ductions do not necessarily guarantee that the events recited actually occurred. Through verbatim accounts of hypnotic sessions, the authors show how abductees can be led by the researcher in subtle ways. This, they contend, explains why some researchers extract ac- counts of evil aliens, while other researchers have abductees who almost exclusively see aliens as good. The authors also point out, using hypnotist/re- searcher Dr. Richard Boylan as an example, of how an individual can come to the researcher/therapist con- vinced that he/she is the victim of sexual abuse or Sa- tanic abuse and be switched to believe that he/she is the victim of an alien abduction. Basically, says Randle, the accounts by the abductees reflect the mindset of the hypnotist/researcher, and that by the very nature of the process there will be pressure on the victim to tell the story with the slant that fits the point of view of the particular researcher/therapist. As already noted, the authors' view of the abductee is hardly flattering. They state, for example, that \"as many as 90 percent of the abductees have some sort of sexual dysfunction,\" without specifying exactly how or where they get their statistics. They go on to state that \"a very high percentage of both the male and fe- male abductees that we interviewed openly stated a sexual preference of homosexuality or bisexuality. An equally high number were hypersexual and highly pro- miscuous in their human sex lives. Of the remaining abductees, at least half of them claimed that they had no sex drive whatsoever.\" Insufficient documentation Elsewhere, they put the number of homosexuals at sixty percent of all abductees. Again, there is no de- tailed accounting of how these very questionable fig- ures were obtained. This is a serious omission. If ex- traordinary claims require extraordinary proof, then extraordinary charges require extraordinary documen- tation. Basic fairness to abductees requires that accu- sations of this sort be carefully and fully documented, and this has not been done. Based on the experience of most researchers, these statistics sound far off the mark. The authors would reply, \"It sounds outrageous because the researchers are not asking the right questions.\" Each of us can only judge from our own experience, but the better-known abductees I have conversed with (Travis Walton, Betty Hill, Charles Hickson, Betty Andreasson Luca, Kelly Cahill, Bev Trout, etc.) do not strike me as dysfunc- tional, either before or after the abductions. No doubt there are some dysfunctional abductees, just as there"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Page 14 April 2000 MUFON UFO Journal are dysfunctional teachers, ministers, bankers, and debunkers. Whether the dysfunctional chicken or the dysfunc- tional egg came first has to be questioned when dis- cussing the fact that some abductees have emotional problems. Does sexual dysfunction, for example, gen- erate UFO stories, or do abductions involving sexual procedures cause sexual dysfunction? Have feelings of low self esteem always been present in some abductees, or are they generated by the reported lack of control that abductees have over their own lives? The authors do not seriously consider this possibility. Taking on well-known cases One of the better-known cases that Randle specifi- cally critiques is that of Betty and Barney Hill, unconvincingly explaining away the missing time (they stopped too many times to look at the UFO) and the separate descriptions of the encounter under hypnosis as contamination from cultural sources and each other. But the authors try to have it both ways, criticizing the Hill case partly because the hypnotist, Dr. Ben- jamin Simon, who was not a ufologist, did not believe the abduction account. Surely, then, this hypnotist was not leading the Hills into telling a particular story, yet the story of abduction was told. The authors also suggest that the star map drawn by Betty Hill proved nothing because three different re- searchers (two in addition to the well-known Marjorie Fish) came up with different locations that fit the map. But if the map is not authentic, how did Betty draw something that so far has been logically matched to only three specific locations in the universe? Interestingly, Betty Hill has been a frequent critic of hypnosis, as well as the multitude of abduction ac- counts surfacing in recent years, even pointing to spe- cific cases where people's lives have been damaged through the process of hypnosis and false memories of UFO abductions. \"Real abductions do occur,\" she says, \"but they are extremely rare.\" She adds, \"When a person tells me he learned of his abduction through hypnosis, I suggest he go back to the one who gave him his problems in the beginning, and preferably, not mention my name.\" According to Hill, \"If the abduction is a real one, the person does not need hypnosis, for he will recall over a period of time his own experience. All he needs is patience.\" The authors discuss implants, but conclude that none has been recovered that show extraterrestrial ori- gin. They are equally unimpressed with recall of an ab- duction without hypnosis, attributing this to contami- nation of the witnesses, dreams, or some sort of sleep disorder. They claim, in fact, \"that as many as half of the tales of abduction have sleep paralysis as the pre- cipitating event.\" Here the authors seem to have a problem, however, since they quote R.J. Campbell as saying that sleep disorder is \"much higher in males (80%) than females,\" but this ratio does not seem to fit the male-female makeup of abductees. The authors also discount the value of reports of a UFO being sighted by others at the same time an ab- duction is taking place, terming this evidence as \"ri- diculous. Are we to believe that jet aircraft have some- thing to do with alien abduction because jets were in the sky when some abductions took place?\" Again, this is going beyond reasonable conclusions, and is more appropriate for the usual debunkers. As Dr. Janet Colli pointed out in last month's MUFON Forum, the authors also rely too heavily on Elizabeth Loftus in claiming that it is not possible to recover memories through hypnosis. A recent news report indicates that scientists at University College London claim that a study of 236 adults with recov- ered memories shows that many are true past events. The point is that the jury is still out on this issue, and a less biased presentation would have acknowledged this. Night visitations or sleep paralysis? Night visitations of entities are seen by the authors as related to sleep paralysis, and this is tied to what they term hallucinations involving the feeling of a pres- ence in the room. This, in turn, is compared to tales of incubi and succubi visiting males and females at night, as reported through the centuries. Such cultural phe- nomena, they say, shows that the reports of night visi- tors are \"not specific to a single culture or to the mod- em world. Instead it is a phenomenon that transcends culture and time.\" But, researchers may ask, does this prove that aliens could not be involved in various cul- tures over a long period of time? The authors criticize abduction support groups as perpetuating emotional problems, rather than curing them. However, if abductions are continuous in some cases, then \"cures\" might be difficult or impossible to accomplish. It is as if a woman goes to a support group to get over the problems associated with being raped, while continuing to be periodically raped. At the same time, it is true that poorly run support groups can per- petuate or even create emotional problems associated with abductions, and the authors make a good case for taking a more careful look at this area of ufology. The better cases not explained None of the points raised by Randle and his col- leagues explain the better cases. One example is the abduction involving Travis Walton, where multiple witnesses saw Walton being zapped by a UFO. These witnesses, some of whom did not get along with Walton as members of the forestry crew, have stood by their testimony for 25 years. Regardless of whether Walton's"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal April 2000 Page 15 description of his time aboard the UFO is or is not proved, there is little doubt that he was zapped by the UFO, and couldn't be found for five days. Likewise, the 1973 Pascagoula case involving Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker is not satisfacto- rily explained by the criticisms of abductees and in- vestigators offered in this book. And while the au- thors feel they have satisfactorily dealt with the Allagash abductions by alleging contamination of the witnesses and poor questioning by the researcher, their explanation is incomplete and unconvincing. A more recent case, from Australia, has the elements that the authors claim do not exist. This is the Kelly Cahill case, which involves multiple unrelated wit- nesses separately reporting essentially the same thing. There is also conscious recall without hypnosis, simi- lar marks on the witnesses, and ground traces left by the UFO at the location described by the witnesses. Selective criteria? One is forced to wonder if Randle's UFO crashes at Roswell and other locations could qualify as real events if they were subjected to the same standards he ap- plies to abductions. We would have to discount all testimony, since witnesses can be so easily contami- nated, as well as unintentionally led by the investiga- tor (who must be looking for a crash or he wouldn't be interviewing people), so where is the evidence? The main shortcoming of this book is its lack of , balance and aura of superiority. Evidence for abduc- tions is summarily dismissed and the proponents de- graded, but evidence against abductions is \"scientific.\" In spite of its faults, The Abduction Enigma is cer- tainly not all bad. It may help explain the great explo- sion of abduction cases in recent years as being at least partially due to the improper use of hypnosis, it may help explain why certain abduction researchers come up with only one type of result, it points to some dan- gers in using hypnosis, it indicates that interviewees can be fairly easily misled, and it warns of possible dangers involving support groups. However, it falls far short of proving its main the- sis: that there are no legitimate abduction cases. In this field, certainty is a questionable commodity, and we should be suspicious of anyone who thinks he or she has the final answer. Had the authors taken a more balanced and less debunking approach, the material presented would be better received and have more impact on the UFO community. Should you buy a copy of The Abduction Enigma! I think so. It provides a lot of food for thought, and it encourages us to question our thinking and our proce- dures-something we need to continuously do. But don't give this book to someone else without includ- ing a lengthy warning that there is less there than meets the eye. MUFONFORUM ^'T^-?'-^*^\"' y ''^^!i'~ > \" '»' ^?!*/*\"!^l? Letters to Mufon Black versus white reflections To the Editor: In defense of their \"morphing\" photographs, Schmidt et. al. (Feb. 2000 MUFON UFO Journal) use several arguments involving difficult-to-verify witness testi- mony. However, several of the claims are subject to scientific scrutiny. In disputing the possibility that sun reflection could cause bright spots, Schmidt claims that \"Dark (per wit- ness description) planes do not reflect light well.\" No supporting evidence is given. Since this claim contra- dicts the witness testimony of \"glittering as though someone were reflecting sunlight back at us with a mirror,\" one would expect careful testing of this claim. Actual experiment finds that the reverse is easily true. I found a white car parked next to a black car whose paint jobs are similar to those of airplanes. (Planes are not easily found close ecough together for such a photo, at least in one piece!) As measured by an X-Rite model 418 densitometer, the black car was about 70 times darker than the white car. (Optical densities of 2.22 and 0.36 respectively) However as easily seen, both threw a blinding sun reflection. A black surface, which does not waste light by scattering it in all directions to appear white, can generate a brighter reflection than a white surface. I have measured black-surface reflections that are about 5% brighter than from a white surface. In arguing against reflection, Schmidt claims high odds in photographing a similar \"3-ball\" shape in both incidents, without revealing how similar the images"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Page 16 April 2000 MUFON UFO Journal are, how high the odds are or how they were derived, or why these odds argue against reflection versus some other cause. Similarity of images can be numerically measured using two-dimensional cross-correlation (2DCC); this technique has the advantage of being im- mune to contrast differences due to exposure varia- tions. Actual computation of the 2DCC between the pho- tos (taken from their web site) of the two sightings, shows that the similarity of the two photos touted (#1 in both incidents, correlation 0.892) is not the most similar pair of photos. Nor is this pair's similarity sig- nificantly different (P=0.60 or higher) than the simi- larities of other pairs of photos. Pairs such as #4 of both cases (0.894), or #3 of Fig. 2 versus #5 of Fig. 1 (0.896) are both more similar. Using 2-D phase correlation (2DPC), which places greater weight on detail and edges (more closely match- ing human recognition) the touted pair rates even worse. The \"high odds\" appear easier than a 50-50 coin toss, compared to other pairs of photos that are not so touted. (P is the probability that a coincidence happened randomly. P<0.05, or a coincidence less than one time in twenty, is generally accepted as a statisti- cally significant result.) For background on 2DCC, 2DPC and optical density measurement, refer to US Patent 5,412,577 or 5,689,425 found at www.uspto.gov. In arguing that the object \"blinked out\" rather than merely angling a reflection away from the witnesses, Schmidt states that after a reflection ended, the reflec- tion source \"would still be present and identifiable... it was not...\" Again, no substantiation of this statement is given. This claim is easily disproved by merely watching airplanes. The upper image at right shows a contrail, but the object creating it is not identifiable. Since the plane is scattering little light toward the viewer, it is easily obscured by atmospheric haze. Reminiscent of the magician's \"smoke and mirrors,\" the plane is visible due to a \"3-ball\" reflection in the lower image, despite being further away. Like head- lights in fog, the reflection cuts through haze and pro- vides visibility. Again, actual experiment disproves speculation. MUFON's mission is the systematic collection and analysis of UFO data. Cases suggesting an astounding result, such as novel evidence of disappearance into another dimension, need careful analysis to eliminate conventional causes. But this case rests on unsupported speculation easily disproved with simple backyard experiments. Jeff Sainio MUFON Staff Photoanalyst 7206 W. Wabash, Milwaukee WI 53223-2609 Witnesses report circle of lights in Georgia A circle of lights was reportedly seen rising from behind a wood line in Troup County, GA. about 12:30 a.m. on Jan. 27 by three witnesses. The 25-year-old who reported the sighting said that he, his friend, and his friend's girlfriend were outside when they noticed a circle of \"red and blue round lights\" come straight up only a few hundred yards away. On reaching a level above the woods, the ten to twelve lights went streaking to the east. The lights were described as exceptionally bright and located around the bottom edge of the saucer-shaped vehicle. Some weeks earlier they had seen a large white light moving in fields and woods behind his friend's house. -Reported by John Thompson"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal April 2000 Page 17 Direction of travel Vertex closest to witness Color: Black to charcoal gray (not reflective) Rectangular patterns of 3-dimensional reliefer featuring all over underside Lights (one green, one red) Triangular object reported near Minneapolis By William I. McNeff, Minnesota State Director On Sept. 2, 1999, a woman who is a financial busi- ness administrator for a major local corporation was driving in Plymouth, a suburb on the northwest side of Minneapolis, MN. She was driving along a road lead- ing onto a peninsula that extends out into Medicine Lake, which is near the intersection of Minnesota Hwy 55 and U.S. 169. At the point where the road enters the base of the peninsula she observed a pair of white intensely bright lights located ahead to her left (to the northwest). She felt that they resembled landing lights, except that there were two of them, very close together. To her they seemed to be out of place, and appeared to be searching for something, perhaps something on the lake to the west of the peninsula. It became apparent to her that they were just above the treeline, at a distance that she estimated to be about one block away. She continued to drive up the peninsula for approxi- mately one half block, observing the lights as she could through the trees. She then realized that the lights were not moving. After going a few hundred feet ahead, she reached a point where the trees no longer obscured her view of the lights. She then noted that the lights were no longer vis- ible. Instead, at an elevation of about 30 to 45 degrees above the horizon was a large, dark triangular object, which she felt was just above the treetops. She esti- mated the angular size to be about that of her hand at arm's length. She felt that the absolute size was slightly less than that of a house, but considerably greater than that of a car. This might be in the 30 to 60-foot range. The object was black to charcoal-gray matte-colored (see illustration). The closest vertex of the triangle was pointed in her direction, with the object moving to- ward her. There were lights at the two rear vertices, one red and one green, but she could not remember which was which color. Also, all over the underside of the object was a pattern of 3-dimensional rectangular relief. As the object passed overhead she indicated that she felt an intense mixture of awe and fear, saying that she was afraid to get out of her car. She was not able to hear any sound, although she had the windows closed with the air conditioner on. As the object passed overhead, it was visible simulta- neously through both the driver's side window and the front windshield, indicating considerable angular size. The witness then pulled ahead about 75 feet and turned right into a driveway leading to the waterfront, got out, and observed the object, now to her south over the lake. She eventually lost sight of it when it became obscured by the treeline on the south shore of the lake. No additional witnesses are known, although the object's direction of travel indicates that it would have likely passed over a major highway, which at that time would have been well traveled.

First, USAFE Intelli- gence reported that they received recurring reports of flying saucers. Newspapers throughout Europe had reported on the Neubiberg Air Base incident referred to in the cable. On Oct. 29, 1948, newspapers throughout Europe reported this sighting near Munich: \"Five U. S. Air Force pilots observed a mysteri- ous, silvery object similar in appearance to a so-called flying saucer hanging high over Neubiberg Air Base in Bavaria. The object disappeared at a terrific speed after having remained over the air base more than 30 minutes. A similar object had been seen days before by another group of American pilots.\" These reports touched off a chain of speculative comments among astronomers and scientists on the continent, who variously claimed that the objects were from Russia or from outer space. Few seemed to re- gard them as products of the United States. 2 While the Neubiberg object may have been a re- search balloon, Europe was now talking about flying saucers seen over that continent. During this time frame, Project SIGN, the UFO program at the Intelligence Department of the Air Ma- teriel Command at Wright Field, Ohio, had already sent its Top Secret Estimate of the Situation (EOTS) to Air Force headquarters. Also, the Top Secret Air Intelligence Report 203 (AIR 203), \"Flying Objects Incidents over the US\" produced by the Defensive Air Branch in the Directorate of Intelligence (DI) was also in its final form.. 3 These two documents were in conflict. Project SIGN'S EOTS raised the possibility that UFOs were interplanetary in nature, while AIR 203 speculated that US or foreign research might ac- count for the UFO reports. Into this mix came the second news item from USAFE's cable informing DI that their counterparts in Swedish air intelligence also considered that UFOs might be interplanetary. We can only imagine what happened next, because records of discussion at the Pentagon are not available to us. We do know the outcome of these conflicting ideas. Project SIGN'S EOTS was rejected, and while AIR 203 was presented to the Joint Intelligence Committee in April 1949 as the Air Force Intelligence's position, it too was soon scrapped. 4 Both ideas were out of favor; the idea that UFOs were just misidentifications of natural or man-made objects increasingly gained ground in intelligence circles and would, with few notable exceptions, be the Air Force's public stance on UFOs from 1949 on- ward. USAFE saved the blockbuster for the last part of the message. An object had crashed into a Swedish lake, and \"A technical expert near his home on the edge of the lake\" was the witness. USAFE informed DI that the Swedes had recovery operations for the crashed object under way. Anyone familiar with the 1946 \"Ghost Rockets\" knows that a number of these earlier reports claimed things allegedly came down in Scandinavian lakes. A 1946 Secret letter from the Commander US, Naval Forces, Europe, commented on an earlier 1946 re- covery attempt from a lake in Norway. The Navy was very much interested in what might be found. While they were willing to render assis- tance, there were two problems, the lack of Naval equipment and experts for that type of work in Eu- rope at the time, and the lack of an invitation to assist from the Norwegian government. The Commander, US Naval Force Europe, felt that the matter required authorization from US political authority to proceed. 5 Nothing further officially is known on the Norwegian lake crash, but the \"techni- cal expert\" in the USAFE Swedish lake report was identified in another Top Secret DI 1948 document now at Maxwell AFB 6 : TOP SECRET DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE HEADQUARTERS UNITED STATES AIR FORCE WASHINGTON 24 August 1948 AFOIR-RC MEMORANDUM FOR EXECUTIVE,"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal April 2000 Page 19 AIR INTEL, REQUIREMENTS DIVISION SUBJECT: SUPPLEMENT to Daily Activity 24Aug 1948 1. It has been noted in cable brief that Sweden Armed Force C in C, General Jung, saw an aerial ex- plosion considered to be some form of guided missile originating from Estonian islands, possible Dago or Osel. A point of interest lies in the fact that recent word has been received from our attache in Stockholm of a reconnaissance sortie accomplished over Osel and the stated intention of further aerial reconnaissance there. The Swedish reports have mentioned civilian evacuation on the western coast of the above islands. 2. The Swedish aerial reconnaissance stems from an arrangement which was made with the Directorate of Intelligence for the loan of long focal length cam- eras to the Swedes. 3. General Jung has a keen interest in the products of reconnaissance in a personal as well as an official way. He has as a personal friend the head of the sec- tion of the General Staff of Defense which is charged with covert reconnaissance; General Jung's sister-in-law holds a key position in that section. 4. It is believed that photographs of the area will be received in the near nature. (Lt Col Fuller 2376) /s/ J. E. Mallory IM J. E. MALLORY Colonel, USAF Chief, Reconnaissance Branch Air Intelligence Requirements Div. Directorate of Intelligence TOP SECRET General Jung and a number of others were wit- nesses to the crash, and General Jung's wife wrote about the incident in her diary. Investigations by Clas Sahvn, of UFO Sweden are continuing in Sweden. It should be noted that General Jung thought the object was a missile of Soviet origin. Nothing further is known about the Jung object, but the Swedish recovery effort did find a depression on the floor of the lake that was not on previous hy- drographic charts of the lake. Copies of the USAFE cable were sent to the CIA and AMC at Wright Field. This is very significant. While Ruppelt, Hynek, and Fournet all said that the 1948 Top Secret Estimate of the Situation existed, no official confirmation has been found to support this claim. The USAFE cable indicates that Top Secret documents about UFOs did, in fact, exist at Wright Field and are not part of the current Project Blue Book files at the National Archives. Also, when Sydney Shallet, researching his two- part article for the Saturday Evening Post, went to Wright Field, Mr. Stephen Leo, of the Secretary of the Air Force Public Information Office, sent a letter to Wright Field requesting that Shallet be given ac- cess to Secret information on flying saucers, but that Shallet should not be allowed to see any Top Secret information on the subject. 7 One could say this was just the standard admon- ishment that security matters require, but now it takes on new meaning in light of the discovery of the Top Secret USAFE cable. There was indeed Top Secret information concerning UFOs at Wright Field. *See on the Internet: http://www.projectl947.com/ 'Records Group 341, Entry 214, General Files, Top Secret Control # 2-5317, National Archives II, Col- lege Park, Maryland 2 \"Flying Saucers Invade Europe, Strange Flying Objects Are Appearing in Large Numbers Over the Continent.

David Marler's reporting of the Illinois sightings is excellent. However there is internal evidence that casts doubt on whether the of- ficers were observing the same thing at about the same time. Quoting from Walt Webb's \"The Night Sky\" column for January (December 1999 Jour- nal), \"Venus (-4) is the bright- est morning planet, rising now about 4:30 a.m. and gleaming in the SE at dawn.\" What does that tell us about the likely ex- planation for \"Lebanon officer's\" sighting of \"...a very bright white light east of town\" in the early morning hours? A very common occurrence is for people other than an original witness to hear about a sighting in progress, look up at the sky and see a brilliant Venus (or some other light source or stimulus) and assume that it is what the witnesses are talking about. This officer may not have seen Venus at -4 brilliance before, and what he saw certainly was not \"a star.\" This same officer mentions a sighting about 5 minutes earlier of something that \"looked like a C-5,\" which is an enor- mous aircraft. It should be possible to determine whether a C-5 in fact landed at Scott AFB. In fact, a C-5 can loom startlingly large and, if on land- ing approach, could present an appearance unfamiliar to many people. These facts do not explain rectangular or distinctly delta-shaped craft, however. A C-5 observed in good daylight is distinctly a swept-wing four-engine jet aircraft. It does lumber along rather slowly at low alti- tude. As usual, the witnesses guesstimates of altitude are almost worthless. In this case, the C-5 is so large that you can easily underestimate its height or distance by assum- ing that it is approximately the size of a typical jet air- liner. The hovering deltas could not be conventional air- craft if they were, in fact, hovering, nor could the craft that pivoted rather than making a banking turn. The bril- liant white lights that were unlike searchlight beams and did not extend toward the ground could easily have been landing lights on a C-5 or other aircraft. Each officer in turn tends to assume that what he is looking at is the same object that others have reported before him. This seems unlikely, and could only be de- termined by carefully established timelines, directions of observation, and/or triangulations. The Dupo officer's final observation was of nothing but lights at high alti- tude that did not fit with the earlier observations, and most likely was a conventional aircraft. The reporter says that his team obtained enough data to establish a flight path (assuming the varied descrip- tions of a large relatively low-level object were of the same thing), and states that it \"...turned to the southwest and drastically accelerated.\" This would be a vital point if it could be established, but I see no testimony to that effect in the report. I do see signs of witnesses reacting to different stimuli, some of which may have mundane explanations. Nor is there any (much-to-be-desired) UFO- like performance in the eyewitness descriptions. A follow-up report with more information on the per- formance and behavior of each \"airfoil,\" a check on the presence of a C-5, and testimony about alleged drastic acceleration would be very helpful in sorting out the chaff from the wheat. The July 1952 Washington, D.C., area radar-visual sightings remain among the best and most convincing on record. Although Mr. Lieser makes an interesting case that the Air Force may have engaged in hanky-panky about the sightings, I think that we tend to give the Air Force of that era far too much credit for being organized and in control. An alternative reading of history is that, as vividly depicted by Edward J. Ruppelt, many people in the Air Force were (somewhat understandably) in a state of de- nial about UFOs and kept assuming (or hoping) that people would stop reporting such crazy things. By dis- couraging their own personnel from making reports, they lost a lot of good evidence that otherwise would have made the case for real UFOs more convincing. I don't know the source of David Jacob's assertion that the Air Force had \"secretly\" moved the fighters away from Boiling Field earlier that day, but someone ought to ask him. From memory, I recall that there were no fighter-interceptors any closer that Delaware, as reported, but I also seem to recall that in that Cold War period any \"secrecy\" about Washington being unprotected by local fighters would have been to prevent the Soviet Union from knowing about it. In any event, the sightings de- serve further detailed analysis and discussion. Space prohibits more detailed comments on Donald Burleson's analyses of the Ramey letter, but he is to be commended for citing his methods and reporting the ca- veats to his interpretations. It seems to me, though, that his concluding remarks (pp. 11-12) go beyond anything justified by the evidence he presents. Continued objec- tive analysis by him and others may or may not decipher the message. The established words are suggestive only. One thing to investigate is whether \"Temple\" is someone's name or possibly a code name."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal April 2000 Page 21 MUFON MERCHANDISE Wear official MUFON T-Shirts (royal blue printing on white cot- ton), sizes: S, M, L & XL.

Binoculars help locate this near- est planet to the Sun. Look for a tiny orange object low in the WNW twilight sky. Mars (magnitude 1.6), in Taurus, might be glimpsed early in May, hovering very low in the WNW at dusk. Thereafter the reddish planet disappears into the Sun's glare. Mars sets soon after 9 PM. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus isn't observable this month. Toward the end of the month, Jupiter and Saturn become visible at dawn very low in the ENE but only to southern observers. Unusual Planet Lineups: Although too close to the Sun to be seen, Venus passes only 22\" of arc from the edge of Jupiter's disc on May 17. The close pairing of the two planets is extremely rare and won't be this close together again until 2065. For the first time in 38 years, no naked-eye solar system object is visible in a dark sky between about May 3 and 5. On May 5 the Sun, Moon, and the 5 naked-eye plan- ets span 26 degrees of the heavens, their smallest geo- centric angle (as seen from Earth) since 1962 and their closest separation until 2675! However, only Mars and the crescent Moon in the evening sky and Venus in the morning have a chance of being seen. On the 17th the Sun and 5 bright planets (but not the Moon) span only 19.5 degrees of sky as seen from Earth. None of the planets, however, are visible then. Finally, on May 31 Jupiter passes only 1.2 degrees above Saturn, a conjunction that occurs between the two only every 20 years. Meteor Shower: Since the May Aquarid meteors radiant point doesn't rise until 3 AM, the shower is strictly a morning show. Without any Moon interference this year, up to about 20 meteors per hour should streak out of Aquarius in the E toward dawn. The yellowish Aquarids produce long paths across the heavens, a third of which leave behind \"trains\" or wakes persisting for some seconds. Moon Phases: New moon—May 4 First quarter—May 10 Full moon—May 18 Last quarter-May 26 The Stars: € O On late spring evenings the bright orange star Arc- turus, in kite-shaped Bootes (bo-ol-teez) the Herdsman nears the celestial meridian in the south. Bootes has sometimes been depicted as driving the nearby Great Bear Ursa Major across the heavens. The familiar Big Dipper is part of the bear. (Indeed, Arcturus means \"bear keeper\" or \"bear guard.\") Just E of the kite of Bootes lies the U-shaped, upside-down crown of Princess Ariadne, Corona Bo- realis the Northern Crown. If you live below latitude 30 degrees N, look now for the Sun's nearest stellar neighbor in the southern sky, Alpha Centauri. The luminary is also the 4th brightest star in the night sky. And from the extreme southern states and Hawaii, it is the season to view Crux the Southern Cross during the evening hours.

Reduced Prices for Symposium Proceedings If you have been trying to add a majority of the past years' symposium proceedings to your library, here is the opportunity you have been waiting for. Due to the fact that we are moving the MUFON headquarters to the Denver, CO, area, we have elected to sell the most recent proceedings at a five-dollar discount to reduce the cost of shipping the stock to Denver. Symposium proceedings from the years 1991 through 1994 will now sell for $15, and those from 1995 through 1999 will be $20. The shipping and han- dling charges will remain the same as on the MUFON Publication List: the first book in the U.S. is $1.75, and each additional book is one dollar. For foreign or- ders the first book is $2.75, and each additional book is $2.00. This special price has been extended to June 1, 2000, due to popular demand. Order now while it is fresh in your mind. UFO Sighting Reports A radical improvement in the lead articles published in the monthly Journals was noted starting with De- cember 1999. This has been due to the fact that our State/Provincial Directors and State Section Directors are writing narrative reports of their UFO investiga- tions and submitting them to the International Direc- tor for publication. I know that there are many other outstanding re- ports that are only getting exposure in the pages of MUFON State and Chapter publications. This is an invitation to share these reports on an international level with your constituents worldwide. Supporting the MUFON Journal MUFON is very concerned about the gradual de- crease in the number of Journals mailed each month over the past few years. Although the Journal is stron- ger and has a greater circulation than some other well known UFO publications in this country and elsewhere, we cannot afford to become complacent. MUFON is fully cognizant that the web sites and e- mail communications are our most serious competi- tion, as with most other print publications, but there are many articles, photos, and drawings in the Journal that are not found on the Internet. In addition, the Jour- nal is physically more convenient to read, as well as serving as a valuable resource for future reference. Many readers have their Journals bound, keeping them as permanent library books. The value of back issues of the Journal is clear when one visits dealers in UFO publications and notes the prices for older copies. We took a membership survey in 1997 in which our members evaluated both the MUFON UFO Jour- nal and the organization itself. Based on this, changes were made, and we have had many positive comments. These comments are directly, measured in the re- duced percentages of lost memberships since July 1998. But the Board of Directors is not satisfied with the loss of any subscribers, since MUFON at one point had more than 5,000 members. There are at least three things you can do to help keep the Journal the premier monthly UFO publica- tion in the world. First, when you receive the reminder to renew your subscription, stop to seriously consider the value you are receiving each month in documented UFO information, and renew while you are thinking about it. Second, personally invite your friends and relatives to subscribe to the MUFON UFO Journal, or give them a gift subscription. Third, mention the Jour- nal in a positive way when you are on the Internet. Just remember that if each current member would se- cure only one new member, the total membership would reach an all-time high. This can be done if we accept the challenge. Your efforts to promote MUFON are much appreciated."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Page 24 April 2000 MUFON UFO Journal DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE ^^aTteT^cffus' --=- O ' NEWS FROM AROUND THE NETWORK New Officers After 20 years as MUFON's Representative to Swit- zerland, Theodore Auerbach is retiring as the head of MUFON Switzerland and appointing Rene J. Zingg (Emmenbruecke) as his successor. Dr. Auerbach will continue as Consultant in Physics. Retiring New York State Director Dana M. Schmidt, J.D., has appointed James G. Bouck, Jr. (Schenectady) to fill this responsible position. Mr. Bouck selected Robert D. Long (Reading Center) to be his Assistant State Director for upstate New York.
