Miller Editor's Note: Last month the first part of the account of the experiences of \"Vicki Hoyle,\" the former Chicago nurse was presented. She had con- tacted the author in an attempt to find an expla- nation for physical effects experienced, beginning when she woke up on Jan. 10,1994. These included severely reddened face, a wound (later turning into a lump) by her left ear, sores around her mouth and chin, white marks and sores around her eyes, hair falling out, nose bleed, and irritated cervix and vaginal wall. She was also experiencing psy- chological effects, including fear, panic, impaired thinking, trance-like state, dreams, memory lapse, and a feeling of being observed. A second episode on the night of Jan 17 involved missing time and a dream about being taken (strapped in a seat) to a big room by a man with white skin, white hair, and \"shark eyes.\" During a later hypnotic regression she told of floating down a corridor to a room, similar to what she had \"dreamed.\" She reports, \"They're cutting me with things....!'m covered with blood.\" Part 2 The crew finishes, and in a dull tone she relates, \"I'm kind of riding down a corridor.\" The redness is gone, replaced by her white bedwear. The session ends, though minutes pass before she regains com- posure. Experts advise that hypnotic imagery is open to interpretation. In early recollections, Mrs. Hoyle saw herself in a red \"robe,\" or \"miniskirt.\" Now she saw blood, gushing hotly from her abdomen. This could be a flourish of the imagination. Then again, the im- ages of restraints and cutting correspond to the physi- cal damage that followed the \"dream.\" Also, this se- quence of cause and effect matches reports about the alien reproductive program. UFO sighting In the 1960s, subject saw a UFO in Redington Beach, FL. She had recurrent dreams of capture. As an adult, she sketched the UFO (a tear-shaped ob- ject) and recounted a possible CE 4. \"We lived near the beach with a nice view from the yard. It was about 11 p.m. at the time, and I pulled a lawn chair from the enclosed porch to the middle of About the Author Paul R. Miller is a MUFON Field Investigator trainee. He is a hypnotist and NLP practitioner with Miller & Associates, Chicago, and has written articles on UFOs and the paranormal for Fate and Gray Ar- eas magazines. the backyard one night so I could look at the stars.\" The UFO was \"silent,\" teardrop-shaped and \"totally black.\" It \"occluded one-third of the sky\" as stars \"disappeared, behind it.\" She watched it drift slowly, casting a grayish haze, until she \"fell asleep.\" This is the only sighting she recalls; it occurred between 1961 and 1962. UFOs and space travel sounded like \"fantasy\" to Vicki. However, \"When I was little I used to be chased by a stick man. The dream repeated over and over as I ran through the neighborhood, looking for places to hide. The stick men were gray and real thin.\" Sightings are part of the history of many abductees. Some authors have identified concentrations of UFOs and abductions. 1 This seems pertinent, since Vicki's en- counters overlapped a UFO wave, and a witness reported seeing unusual lights near Vicki's home. 2 In childhood, what did she see? The years 1961-62 saw the launch of several American and Russian satel- lites. When visible, satellites fly at high altitudes. They look tiny, a pin prick of light, and are illuminated by the rays of the sun. Vicki's UFO was dark, filling one-third of the sky as it came overhead. \"I forget what happened after that.\" According to Barbara Spellerberg, reports ending with the subject \"falling asleep\" often mask a more dramatic encounter. 3 Her age at the time of the sighting corresponds to the age when many reportedly enter the breeding program. At the time, Vicki hadn't reached menarche, but \"I was physically well devel- oped.\" She reports, \"When they chased me, I hid in the dog house. I ran behind the hills. I hid in the woods. They caught me going into the woods.\" She comments, \"We didn't have TV back then, so I don't know where I got the idea from.\" The stick men terrified her, \"and they'd catch me every time.\" What happened then? \"I don't remember. I'd just wake up.\" Episode Three-attitude adjustment Initially the witness put no stock in UFOs, and when a friend suggested she had \"had an experience, like a close encounter,\" she replied, \"There has to be another explanation. I just don't feel that's a viability.\" Her per- secutors were will-o'-the-wisps in hazy corridors. As a nurse she had treated others' problems by direct action; now she felt aimless. Her ills were caused by an invis- ible contaminant-a situation that brings abductees in line"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 November 1999 MUFON UFO Journal with those suffering from PTSD, such as Agent Or- ange victims. 4 This changed around the night of Aug. 9, 1994. Vicki was wide awake when a group of thin, pale figures with ropy limbs appeared in the Hoyles' bed- room. They seemed to be waiting for her and wasted no time. One produced a pen-like rod with a light at the end. He put it to her head, possibly penetrating the temple. What she saw in those few seconds changed her life. I got a phone call saying, \"Paul, they're back. They're real, and they're alive.\" PM: About what time of night did this happen'? VH: I go to bed about midnight or 1 o'clock. It happened then. I lay down, 1 put my arm around my husband, and ... there they were. I didn't see them enter or exit. PM: How many? VH: Maybe five. Five for sure. PM: What did they look like? VH: They were short, about a foot shorter than I am, and I'm 5' 9\". That I could tell from where they stood next to the light switch. Also, it was dark in the room, but I saw that they had this palish skin. It wasn't flesh-colored, but it was in shadow, and they had these big, bug-like eyes. PM: Did the eyes project outward, or. . . VH: No, they were like in the face, in the face. But they didn't have a pupil. I didn't see an iris like we have. It was all one color, so it looked like an insect to me. PM: Were the eyes square, tightly set, or what? VH: No. they were almond-shaped and really big. Slanted....Have you ever seen a Praying Mantis? That was the shape [of the face]... You know how we stand erect and our head is aligned? But actually they crouch, and their chins are forward, and they move really quick. They move very quick. And it reminded me of an in- sect, except that they only had two arms and two legs. PM: Was there anything else about the way they moved, other than the speed? VH: They moved together. Except one. That's the one that came with this wand and stuck it on my head....They circled, you know? That was the scariest part, because I definitely felt that I was being stalked by insect-like beings. I don't think that they're human like we are....They move differently. PM: Like robots?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal November 1999 Page 5 VH: Oh, I didn't feel that they were robots at all. They sure didn't move like robots. They had wavy movements....When I said that they were alive, it's because I just knew that they were alive. PM: Did this seem real to you? VH: Real....They're bipedal. They stand up. They have two legs and feet, kind of, and they have append- ages on the ends of their arms like we do, sort of. They superficially look like us, but they're just not human. PM: One came over to you! Did you have a special feeling about that one? VH: Oh no. I felt the same about all of them, and I definitely didn't like the one who came after me with the wand. OK? But I knew that it was inevitable. It was so weird....All I saw was that thing, that silvery long tube with this white light at the end. And they touched my forehead with it and my brain turned to mush. I didn't even stop them, or fight them. I couldn't, you know? I thought about it. PM: How did you feel when the tube came up at you? VH: I'll tell you, gosh, when it was happening to me...it seemed familiar, because I didn't, like, leap out of bed or anything....You know, the truth is, I feel that one big strong woman could squash a bunch of those. But I never can do that. I didn't do it last time, and I didn't do it this time. PM: So it doesn't seem to be a matter of physical power, but a question of what you have the impulse to do? VH: Right....It occurs to me in retrospect that I would like to just plow through them... But the truth is that when it happened, I did not have that urge at all. They were there, they were scary, and there was noth- ing I could do. [Note: Afler this episode, the flesh lump behind subject's ear went away.] Alternative hypoththeses Factors within the case suggest alternative ways to explain the testimony: FPP (Fantasy-Prone Personality). Fantasy-prone individuals can derive lurid ideas from everyday stimuli. Since trauma can spark paranoia and emotional upset, Vicki's ills may have fired her imagination, pro- ducing a fantasy of abduction. latrogenic causation. An explanation similar to the above was sought by family members, who put no stock in the possibility of alien visitation. We met in the sum- mer of 1995 to discuss the following theory. At a prior time, Mrs. Hoyle had undergone surgery. They believed that anesthesia-induced hallucinations were buried in her subconscious. Her wounds-whatever their source- brought the phantoms to life, generating the abduction scenario. Deception. To fake the evidence, a person would need to be versed in UFO literature. I casually ques- tioned Mrs. Hoyle on what she knew while browsing her books and magazines (no hits). She said she had read Intruders. Subsequently, this work was studied for parallels to the testimony. Analysis will focus on these hypotheses, though other options were considered. 5 For rhetorical purposes, grant the wounds a mun- dane cause. Say the burns came from contact with a stove orbed light. The marks were inflamations of non- specific origin (an allergic reaction). A naive or imagi- native person might decide that the stove was a UFO or the bed light an alien beam. Such is said to happen with FPPs. 6 The question is, does this sort of thinking sound plausible for a woman with 20 years experience in nursing? If Hoyle's mind were affected by a medical experi- ence, the line between plausibility and fantasy blurs. This opens the way to iatrogenic causation. Indeed, anesthesia can have hallucinogenic properties, and at- tempts have been made to tie UFOs/ETs to hallucino- gens. 7 However, none has shown how to generate the abduction. I refer to David Jacobs' matrix, a set of obtuse procedures performed by drones in drab decor. 8 I informed the family that while Vicki's story sounded fantastic, it held a dozen staples of the expe- rience-items as dramatic as the rod with the light 9 (which turned her brain \"to mush\"), or as negligible as the restraints. 10 Her story didn't resemble a bad trip; it resembled hundreds of accounts that have been col- lected in the MUFON database.\" What of a hoax? Subject's interest and knowledge of UFOs seemed sparse, but comparison to Intruders found parallels. These matches could result from de- ception, or the fact that the book shows people in simi- lar plights. The following exchange took place: \"Did you read •Intruders before your memories surfaced?\" \"Hell no. I thought all that stuff was nonsense.\" Nowhere does it describe a wall melting into a portal....the event high- lighted by Hoyle in two interviews and two drawings. It further serves to ask, if a hoax, what was the payoff? | The payoff would need to cover the \"supporting cast.\" \\ Her family verified the wounds, the dates, the person- i ality changes. Since they opposed the idea of a visita- I tion, it seems a poor performance for players in a fa- cade.

The internal damage was unprec- edented in the life of subject, a middle-aged woman whose culture test was negative. Confirming the severity of the burns, a family mem- ber had offered to drive her to a scientific institute for radiation testing. (Icy roads prevented the trip.) Finally, the symptoms arose in tandem. (\"When the bums ap- peared, I had vaginal irritation.\") No explanation could be found for this, except a ufological framework: •flesh lump: possible alien implant •scoop mark: possible tissue sampling •internal inflammation and tissue damage: pos- sible reproductive procedures. The elements jell when one considers that pelvic inflammation often troubles abductees, 12 and burns fre- quently follow contact with UFOs. 13 Subject appears to meet the criteria adopted by MUFON and CUFOS for the designation of \"abduction experiencer.\" 14 I reviewed these findings with the witness, who in 12 months of investigation had asked nothing, offered no solutions, and declined a second regression. She thanked me for \"being there,\" and said life was on the upswing. She was moving from Chicago to Atlanta. Later she stated that the reason she didn't proceed with the hypnosis is that \"I know I've had several experi- ences. I'm sure of it, and it's too scary to get into.\" For Vicki Hoyle the ultimate payoff would be to never see the abductors again.

Davenport, Director, National UFO Reporting Center (Illustrations: Robert A. Fairfax, Director of Investigations, MUFON/Washington State) Preface: The author presents an untested concept for remotely detecting UFOs in the Earth's atmosphere through the use of \"meteor scatter\" communications technology. The technique relies on the fact that elec- tromagnetic radiation, i.e. \"radio waves,\" does not penetrate \"clouds\" of ionized gases, but rather is re- flected by them. This characteristic of radio waves may be useful for detecting the sometimes colored \"trails\" that frequently are reported by witnesses to follow behind fast mov- ing UFOs. The article assumes that these \"trails\" are the result of conventional ionization. The author is not experienced in the field of radio communications, data processing, or any aspect of elec- trical engineering. Rather, he presents his views from the standpoint of a layman in such matters. The ar- ticle is intended generally to alert the UFO commu- nity to the possibility of a technology that may be use- ful for detecting the presence of UFOs. For this reason, the author invites comment by mem- bers of the UFO community, particularly by those who may be skilled in various aspects of the technical sub- jects addressed here. If the proposed detection system proves to be effec- tive, it will represent the first time in the history of ufology that civilian investigators of the UFO phenom- enon will possess the ability to detect UFOs remotely, reliably, and objectively. Background Serious investigators of the UFO phenomenon have long sought to be able to detect and record UFOs through some means other than eyewitness accounts. Many devices have been either used, or proposed, to detect UFO's, to include traditional radar, cameras, the- odolites, magnetic detectors, flash detectors, and pre- sumably many other methodologies, as well. Such techniques are frequent in the literature, although most are usually found in the classified advertisement see- About the Author Peter Davenport, Director of the National UFO Reporting Center since July 1994, received his un- dergraduate education at Stanford University, where he earned bachelor's degrees in Russian and biology. At the University of Washington in Seattle, he earned an M.S. in the genetics and biochemistry of fish, as well as an M.B.A. degree in finance and international business. He experienced his first UFO sighting over the St. Louis municipal airport in the summer of 1954, and investigated his first UFO case in 1965 in Exeter, New Hampshire. Davenport has served as the director of investigations for the Wash- ington Chapter of MUFON. tion of such literature. All of these techniques appear to have some degree of merit, but they lack the ability to register the pres- ence of a UFO under all conditions. Moreover, some of them are impractical for use by ufologists, since, they require substantial quantities of expensive equip- ment, they have a limited range or field of view, they require a highly trained operator, etc.. Moreover, these methodologies frequently generate results that are as ambiguous as the UFO phenomenon itself. Hence, the data resulting from such systems have been of little use for serious-minded UFO research. A method which may prove more useful in detect- ing UFO's remotely, particularly those moving at high velocities, relies on \"meteor-scatter\" communications technology. The technology is not new, having been conceived of and developed during the 1950's and 1960's. It was first developed to \"bounce\" radio waves, and perhaps radar waves, as well, off the ionized \"tails\" of meteors as they pass through the atmosphere at very high velocities, traditionally measured in tens of kilo- meters per second. These \"trails\" of very hot gases generated by mete- ors traditionally are very high in the atmosphere, and very short-lived, lasting usually not more than a few seconds. However, their presence can be detected at ground level by detecting the radio waves they are seen to reflect. Just as radio waves are seen to \"skip\" long distances by bouncing off the ionosphere, they also are seen to \"skip\" off the long trails of hot gases, i.e. ion- ization generated by these fast moving meteors. The presence of such ionization in the upper atmo- sphere is detected by tuning an appropriate radio re- ceiver to any transmitted radio signal, which is broad- cast from \"over the horizon.\" (Please see Illustration 1.) If the signal is of high enough frequency, and there- fore is limited to line-of-sight detection, the only cir-"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PageS November 1999 MUFON UFO Journal Illustration 1: Trails of ionization in the Earth's atmosphere reflect radio waves from over the horizon. \"Meteor-scatter\" technology can detect the reflected signal. cumstance in which the receiver will be able to detect the broadcast signal from over the horizon is if the sig- nal is somehow reflected down to the receiver's an- tenna. Experience shows that radio signals tradition- ally can be reflected by meteors \"trails,\" high flying aircraft, migrating birds, clouds of bats or insects, vari- ous meteorological conditions, and perhaps other ob- jects, as well. In recent years, this technique for skipping radio communications has been used by \"ham\" radio opera- tors, and relatively simple, reliable, and inexpensive radio equipment has been developed in support of this application. In addition, the technology has been em- ployed in commercial fields as a low-cost, low-main- tenance means for communication of substantial amounts of data to and from remote areas. Some evi- dence also suggests that \"meteor scatter\" technology has been used for various purposes by U. S. govern- ment agencies for clandestine or discrete communica- tions systems. 1 suspect that the ionization trails, presumed to oc- cur behind fast-moving UFOs, would reflect radio waves, just as the ionized trails behind meteors rou- tinely are seen to do. If this is the case, even though UFOs themselves might not appear on radar, which appears generally to be the case, the trails of ioniza- tion that are reported to follow them might allow them to be detected remotely, nevertheless. Experience In his initial investigation of whether \"meteor scat- ter\" technology might be useful in UFO research, I discovered information suggesting that extraordinar- ily unusual events apparently sometimes are recorded by this technique."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal November 1999 Page 9 When I first began to explore this possibility, I had several meetings with engineers and executives who work in that industry. During one of those meetings, I was shown evidence of a number of events that had been \"captured\" by a company's test facility. The events were so bizarre, and seemingly so inexplicable, that the company's technical staff had assumed them to be erroneous data. The data suggested that the equip- ment infrequently was detecting targets at several tens of kilometers in altitude, they were travelling at tens of kilometers per second, and they sometimes were de- tected making abrupt, seemingly \"instantaneous\" turns. The company's engineers, apparently either not aware of the UFO phenomenon, or not interested in it, had consigned the data to what they referred to as the \"garbage heap,\" i.e. data that appeared not to be of any further use or interest! Their equipment was capturing approximately 100 events per hour, and approximately 1-2 percent of the intercepts were of such bizarre na- ture that the engineers simply ignored them! Whether these anomalous events were due to the inadvertent detection of UFOs, or whether they may be attributable to some other cause, is not clear at this time. However, having seen the data generated from these events, I believe that theydeserve further inves- tigation. Moreover, I believe that UFOs may have been detected by \"meteor scatter\" equipment for a long time, perhaps decades, and this fact has gone unnoticed by most investigators. On this latter point, it is intriguing to consider whether this possibility has been ignored by govern- ment-employed investigators, given that some govern- ment agencies apparently routinely use this type of communications technology Design A typical \"meteor-scatter\" radio station consists of an antenna, a receiver, a specially designed signal pro- cessor, and a computer. Experience suggests that the optimal operating frequency is in the 40-50 megahertz range, which provides the line-of-sight requirement of the signal. In addition, experience further suggests that the receiver stations are best located in areas in which spurious radio signals are minimal, e.g. rural locales. If the receiver is tuned to a radio signal broadcast from over the horizon, it generally detects the signal only on those occasions, as described above, in which the signal is reflected back to ground level from some \"target\" in the atmosphere. Analysis of the received signal, through the use of specially designed software, allows information ; about the nature of the reflection \"target,\" e.g. altitude, velocity, trajectory, etc., to be extracted from the data. Characteristics of the target Illustration 2: Each detection station can \"reach out\" approximately 1,000 statute miles. Hence, the airspace above the North American continent can be monitored with just a few monitoring stations. can then be used to distinguish between different types of objects detected by the system. Experience suggests that a typical \"meteor-scatter\" receiver, operating in the 40-50 mhz frequency range, can detect a reflected radio signal transmitted from as far away as approximately 1,000 miles. Hence, only approximately 4-5 receiver stations, each reaching out up to that distance, hypothetically would be required to monitor the airspace above virtually the entire North American continent. (Please see Illustration 2.) Conclusion If the observations and proposals cited in this article are correct, it may allow UFO researchers, for the first time in the history of ufology, to detect the presence of UFOs at a considerable distance, and in a cost-effec- tive, objective, and repeatable fashion. It seems obvious that if the presence of anomalous objects in the atmosphere can be shown irrefutably, and those same events cannot be explained away by mun- dane causes of terrestrial origin, then ufology is a step closer to being able to demonstrate to the world that our suspicions are correct: namely, that we are not alone on our planet."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Page 10 November 1999 MUFON UFO Journal Ufologv Profile Elizabeth Klarer By Cynthia Hind My first UFO article was for the magazine Illus- trated Life Rhodesia, based mainly on reports I had read and from newspaper clippings in our local pa- pers. It is also true that although the reports sounded genuine, they usually finished with scep- tical conclusions such as \"hav- ing recently emerged from the local pub, it's no wonder the witness saw flying lights all over the sky.\" or \"next time we suggest they take more water with it!\" Nevertheless, that first inves- tigation into what was then known as \"Flying Saucers\" pro- duced a nice pile of mail, and having seen all the letters, I was Cynthia Hind convinced that the subject needed further delving into. One of the letters had mentioned a South African contactee, Elizabeth Klarer, and as I was on my way to Cape Town via Johannesburg (where she lived), it was an excellent opportunity to ask if I could inter- view her. She agreed to this, so early in 1968 I called upon her, and she told me her story. She used to spend time with her sister and brother-in-law in the Drakensberg Mountains, not far from Durban, where they owned a farm. In 1957, riding up in the hills, she saw a craft flying above her, with a man standing inside, watching her. At first she was afraid, but then she realized they meant her no harm and the craft soon shot up into the clouds and disap- peared. Some time later, she had a compulsion to go to the spot again, and this time she found the craft on the ground, and the man she had seen before waiting for her. Elizabeth claimed that she fell in love with him. His name was Akon and he was the commander of the craft, which originated on the planet Meton, in Proxima Centauri. They became lovers, and Elizabeth eventually bore him a son, Ayling, born on Meton. However, she could not adjust to the atmosphere there, and her heart and breathing began to suffer, so that in the end, leaving Akon and Ayling, Elizabeth had to return to Earth alone. Her story, which I had written, appeared in Fate magazine in, I think, August 1968. Despite finding it difficult to accept what she told me, I found her to be a About the Author Cynthia Hind is MUFON's Continental Coordinator for Africa.

The veteran researcher lives in Harare, Zimbabwe. charming and beautiful woman. She was a real lady, softly-spoken and genteel, always elegantly dressed. She was an accomplished musician and had obtained a Meteorologist's Diploma when she lived in Oxford, England. She had the most incredible green eyes slant- ing slightly upwards, with a soft smile curving her lips. She had written a book, Beyond the Light Barrier, about her experience, but could not find a publisher for it. I was going over to the United States and of- fered to take it with me to MUFON to see if they could help sell it there. The Americans were always more open-minded about UFOs than any other group of people I knew; they were more willing to listen to sto- ries of sightings, so they were already knowledgeable about UFO lore, however way-out the story might ap- pear. Elizabeth was convinced she was being spied on by the Russians (this was during the Cold War period), and on one occasion when a craft landed or attempted to land in the Drakensberg, she hid away so they could not find her. I always felt that this part of her story was due to her active imagination, for why would the Rus- sians, who apparently had plenty of their own sightings and contactees to contend with, seek out Elizabeth in a remote part of South Africa? When I reached Jan Smuts Airport in Johannesburg, on my way to a MUFON Conference in Dayton, OH, Elizabeth was waiting for me with the manuscript of her book. \"Please take great care of it,\" she said. \"There may be Russians on the plane, and they will try to take it from you.\" I guarded that book with my life! It sat on my lap, heavy and loose-leaved, right through the entire jour- ney. Of course I dozed at times, but the moment I felt the book slipping off my lap I would be awake again, totally demoralized by lack of sleep. It was one of the most uncomfortable journeys I have ever made. At last, with a sense of relief I was able to hand the book over to Joe Brill in Quincy, IL. Alas, it didn't sell in the United States, not because it wasn't an ex- citing story, but because Elizabeth was a romantic, and there are sections of her book which are reminiscent of a typical woman's love story in a popular novel. I discussed this with Elizabeth. Here she was, try- ing to persuade the world that she had met and cohab- ited with an \"alien,\" a man from another planet or an-"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal November 1999 Page 11 other Dimension, and certainly she needed some sci- entific data or serious discussion to prove her story. Elizabeth was adamant that this was how it had all happened, and she was not prepared to alter anything. All these inconsistencies always worried me about Elizabeth, but she was such a charming, kindly person that it was difficult to be too critical of her. Sadly, in early February 1994, she passed away, her last years dogged by poverty alleviated by her son David. In UFO AFRINEWSNo. 19, there was an extremely interesting story told by \"Doug.\" He and his wife were honeymooning in the Drakensberg, and while walk- ing not far from their hotel they came across a cairn of stones a short distance from Champagne Castle moun- tain. When they returned to the hotel they asked the pro- prietors, Connor O'Hagan-Ward and his wife, about the cairn. He told them it had been put there by Eliza- beth Klarer to mark \"Flying Saucer Hill\" where she had allegedly met a man from outer space. O'Hagan-Ward then went on to say that one day when his wife was alone at the Reception a tall, good-looking man came in and asked for Elizabeth Klarer. Mrs O'Hagan-Ward had never heard of her, nor was she booked at the hotel or due to come. The man thanked her and left. A few seconds later her husband came in and his wife asked if he had seen the man, or seen him leave in his car. The husband was positive he had seen no-one, nor had there been any unrecognized cars in the car park. Awhile later Elizabeth did turn up with her newly-published book. In it there was a drawing of Akon, her spaceman lover. Mrs O'Hagan-Ward rec- ognized him immediately. It was the man who had called and asked for Elizabeth! One other fascinating point: Elizabeth had always told me that she was constantly in touch with the South African Air Force (SAAF) and reported to them about her meetings and trips with Akon. I was doubtful about this, but never queried it. I knew it could never be proven. On one occasion in her book she says that her sister, her brother-in-law, and herself sheltered a SAAF helicopter team who were forced to land on the farm during a heavy storm. O'Hagan-Ward told Doug that the SAAF used to fly Elizabeth to her rendezvous with her memories each year after she had become too elderly to ride up there on horseback. They would land her there and come back for her later. On Friday, 5 March 1999,1 appeared on Cape-talk, a radio show in Cape Town, where I was interviewed by Lisa Chiat, the talk-show hostess. We discussed Elizabeth Klarer and her bizarre story; her absolute conviction that she told the truth. There were numer- ous phone calls coming into the programme, one be- ing from a man who had worked at O'Hagan-Ward's hotel. \"The story you told about the SAAF taking and fetching Elizabeth Klarer to Flying Saucer Hill,\" he said, \"is absolutely true. I saw it with my own eyes.\" I have never felt that Elizabeth Klarer deliberately lied to me; she was not that sort of person. But it can happen that people sincerely believe that something has happened to them when in actual fact it has not. It is an illusion, a dream-state of euphoria. But today people readily believe Betty and Barney Hill; they believe Linda Cortile and dozens of other abduction stories which occurred in the USA. So when we get down to basics, why not Elizabeth Klarer? The following was forwarded to the Journal: 509 th Bomb Group Files... \"This is the shoulder patch from the famous USAF's 509 th Bomb Wing, formerly stationed at Roswell, NM. These are the same folks who recovered the crashed disk on July 4 th , 1947. They fly the B-2 Stealth these days, out of Whitman AFB, MO. The patch is inter- esting for two reasons: it's the only U.S. Air Force patch to depict an alien, and the Latin phrase is quite interesting. It'says 'tastes like chicken.' Hmm...\" Editor's Note: Yes, hmm... This sounded just a bit strange, so I checked with Whiteman (not Whitman) Air Force Base Public Affairs and received the fol- lowing response from Senior Amn Ryan Steinbach: \"I'm Whiteman's editor, and while the patch you described is pretty funny, it's not our patch. Our patch has a mushroom cloud with wings sprouting from a tri-stand. It's interesting, because as the wing that dropped the atomic bombs, we are the only ones in the military allowed to wear a patch that features refer- ence to nuclear weapons. \"The alien patch might have been a joke from the days the wing was stationed at Roswell, N.M., as we were the ones sent out to investigate the infamous crash. However, it has never been our official patch."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Page 12 November 1999 MUFON UFO Journal Kentucky MUFON working with other states to host speakers, educate public, gain members By Kathie Grimes Assistant Director, Kentucky MUFON The July directors meeting in Arlington was truly an inspiration. State directors brought with them ideas we can all share. Jan Harzan in California explained how the organization there brought in speakers on a regular basis. This of course raised their membership and generated cash flow. We want to take this idea to the next level. Most states cannot afford to bring in a speaker, with the air fare being the greatest deterrent. Here in Kentucky we are joining with states around us to share the expense of bringing the speaker in, and then driving the speaker from city to city, allowing the driver and perhaps a passenger to spend time with the speaker and get to know them better. This concept can certainly be expanded. Each state would be responsible for the lodging and meals for the speaker and the speaker's fee. In larger states a speaker might appear in more than one city. Of course you would charge for the speaker; ten or fifteen dollars, depending on your expenses. The air fare could be raised by advanced ticket sales. At the lecture you could rent out vender space, and perhaps sell items your group carries. Sell raffle tickets. Tape your speaker and sell the video (with the speaker's per- mission, of course). By bringing a speaker in every month or every other month the public would gradually become more in- volved, and you should pick up new members. It would of course be important to have this event in the same place each time, and preferably on the same day of the month. During the promotion of the speaker you would cul- tivate a working relationship with the media. Your speaker may do phone interviews for local radio sta- tions. Local TV stations may want an interview or to cover the lecture. The papers would want to carry your event as a public notice and perhaps do a feature story on your speaker and possibly your group. Developing a relationship with the media in your area gives you a chance to educate them. They in turn pass what they learn onto the public, generating more members for your group and another source of sight- ing reports. The speaker sharing program opens your state bor- ders. Your members will be meeting with members in other states, sharing information, ideas, helping one another, and building friendships that will span time. We are currently working with California to bring Kelly Cahill here from Australia for the whole month of January, and would like to set her up with a tour of our great nation. You may remember that she was one of the wonderful speakers featured at the Symposium in Arlington. Here is your chance to be a part of something that will increase your membership, give existing mem- bers a project to work on, create cash flow, educate, and open doors to your neighbors. To be a part of this, or for more information, please contact me at katufo@webtv.net or call 270-526-4017. Through sharing we all can leam and grow in num- bers and knowledge. Abduction research specialist dies By Katharina Wilson Germany's leading abduction researcher, Johannes Fiebag , died on Monday, October 11. Dr. Fiebag learned he had a cancerous stomach tumor in March and underwent a complicated operation to have it re- moved. After the surgery it was discovered that the tumor had metastasized, and he began undergoing che- motherapy treatments. Dr. Fiebag had a strong will to survive and fought very hard-for himself and for his family. Unfortunately for all of us, his cancer had spread too far, too quickly. Dr. Fiebag was born in Northeim, Germany, in 1956. He first became interested in the Ancient Astronaut theory after reading a book he received on his four- teenth birthday. He went on to study geology and pa- leontology and did his graduate work in a special branch of planetology at the University of Wiirzburg. In addition to publishing numerous scientific papers for geological and planetological magazines, Dr. Fiebag and his brother Peter published many books about \"an- cient astronauts\" and extraterrestrial contact. Dr. Fiebag was a friend to abductees, publishing four books specifically about the abduction phenomenon, which focused on cases in Germany, Austria, and Swit- zerland. He introduced the \"Mimicry Hypothesis;\" founded a newsletter for abductees titled \"CE-IV-Re- port;\" organized annual meetings that allowed abductees to network with one another; and formed an interdisciplinary organization of psychiatrists, psy- chologists and other medical professionals who worked directly with abductees."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal November 1999 Page 13 MUFON FORUM Verifying the facts Dear Mr. Connelly, This letter is in regard to a sighting investigation conducted by Mr. Jerry Rolwes, MUFON Washington State Director, and his report in MUFON Skywatch, 10 September, 1999. I just wanted to say thanks for a job well done re- garding his identification of the re-entering Russian booster debris on 1 Sept. I once upon a time worked in the Space Shuttle Program. I know at least one or two things about orbital dynamics, and the information pro- vided by Major Nouis of the Air Force Public Affairs office for the North American Air Defense Command (NORAD), Peterson AFB, Colorado, is indeed consis- tent. I appreciated Mr. Rolwes' comments about how simple it is to verify the facts. I was especially impressed in that he provided names, phone numbers, etc. I understand things like requests for anonymity, but so much of what we think we know is based on \"someone\" says something hap- pened to \"someone\" they knew in 1954 with absolutely no verification. Those things make for entertaining stories, but it isn't proof without verification. It's al- ways refreshing to see someone who's done their home- work, and Mr. Rolwes did it by the book. I'm intellectually honest enough to admit that we still don't know what UFOs are; otherwise, we'd no longer be looking. Yet it seems widely assumed UFOs are ET in nature. It is certainly a reasonable assump- tion, but as a researcher, I'd have to say we don't ab- solutely KNOW that. Yet I see articles in the Journal as well as elsewhere that say, \"The aliens are doing this, and the aliens are doing that,\" etc. when we just don't KNOW that. As a researcher, I can't tell you what UFOs are with any physical certainty. There seems to be a whole new religion being developed out of this entire UFO/ab- duction thing, and that concerns me. It's a whole new belief system based on absolutely nothing set in stone. We constantly hear about conspiracy theories, but there is only one conspiracy I am absolutely sure of, and it comes from within the field of ufology itself. It is a New Age agenda being driven largely by be- lief in \"Space Pals.\" That's why I appreciate Mr. Rolwes' report-because it tends to keep the pendulum a little more toward cen- ter. He was able to ask, \"What was it,\" and reached a reasonable conclusion by digging for ALL the evidence, not just preferred, selected evidence. It was a job well done. But subsequent to Mr. Rolwes report, there are still people insisting it was UFO related, or at least happened in conjunction with a UFO event. This of course leaves the door open to endless speculation with absolutely no tangible evidence to support it. If we don't start shutting some of these doors of speculation we have hanging open, we're very likely not going to recognize that ET smoking gun if anyone ever really does stumble upon it. As far as some kind of extraterrestrial life, I'm not digging my heels in ei- ther way. But I am only interested in the verifiable evidence. Wes Clark Alien hair? Editor's Note: The following is in reference to my review in the August Journal of the Australian case written by Bill Chalker and printed in the Interna- tional UFO Reporter which described analysis of a possible alien hair which had reportedly been found wrapped around the penis of Peter Khoury. Dwight, Thank you for running your coverage of this research and sending a copy. I was however disappointed that you introduced a spurious point, ie. \"While the sample was blonde or clear at the time of testing, perhaps it was originally black, but the color was removed by some process that APEG is not familiar with.\" My article included details that specifically address this issue. The material was blonde or clear at the time of discovery back in 1992. This was verified by Peter Khoury, his wife and some researchers who saw the sample soon after the incident. I saw the sample in 1996. It was blonde or clear then. The biochemist looked at it from 1998. Again there was no change. In other words, it was never black when it was found. Hence your point is spurious. Please ensure this correction is run in the MUFON UFO Journal. I would appreciate a copy of that issue. Regards, Bill Chalker Editor's Note: The following reply was sent via e-mail to Bill, with no further response from him: Thanks for the letter for the Forum. I apparently was not very clear, since I was referring primarily to what could have happened before the hair was discovered, not after it was discovered. I think my review pretty well indicated that the hair was blonde/clear when dis- covered, although we do have only the single witnesses' testimony to back that up. I think this is a good case, but that there has been no positive tie-in between the the blonde on the bed and the hair that was discovered (Continued on Page 16)"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Page 14 November 1999 MUFON UFO Journal Joe Brill The Soviet UFO Files by Paul Stonehill, Director of the Russian Ufology Center; published in the U.S. by Quadrillion Publishing lnc.,230 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10001-ISBN 1-85833-858-1 Reviewed by Joseph Brill Since this was my specialized research for MUFON for many years (UFO's Behind The Iron Curtain), I felt honored to review this book. The So- viet UFO Files is an impressive col- lection of history and cases that reveal that the Soviet Union has no more an- swers than the U.S. when it comes to the UFO mystery. From the first few pages which re- late UFO sightings taking place and recorded as far back as AD 921 through the June 30,1908, Tunguska phenomenon, facts are presented and the reader is left to determine what the answers might be based on what the eyewitnesses reported. Chapter Two deals with the World War II and Cold War years when Joseph Stalin and Nikita Khruschev ruled Russia. It is clear that much investigation was going on during these years which defied explanation, and each side thought that this phenomenon might be a secret weapon of the other side. This book includes hundreds of photographs of UFOs and related physical evidence of the existence of what was reported to have been observed by thou- sands of reliable witnesses throughout the enormous region of the former USSR. Much of the material presented has never before been published, as it has been kept \"Top Secret\" by the KGB and other Russian agencies assigned to investigate re- ported sightings. There are some very dramatic cases that appear to defy explanation, and many that compare very well to other cases reported from all comers of the world. The Soviet Union has, according to the material Stonehill presents in this excellent collection of docu- mented cases from all areas of the old Soviet Union, had its fair share of landings, close encounters, mili- tary encounters, and even crash cases. Stonehill has produced a work that is worthy of any student of the UFO phenomenon, and especially those who are looking for information gathered by experts in their respective fields who were called on by the Soviet officials to \"come up with answers.\" From what is presented in this 123-page work, they are as uncertain as all the other experts who have been examining the facts for more than fifty years. The appendix lists a number of UFO research orga- nizations, publications, and individuals, with addresses where they can be contacted throughout Russia. There is a wealth of information on the history of UFOs in the Soviet Union in this work that I never knew existed, and I would give it my utmost recom- mendation for delivering an informative and thorough picture of the UFO phenomenon in one of the most secretive governments in the world. A four-star rating for the information and illustra- tions contained in The Soviet UFO Files. Stonehill has earned a place in my UFO library with this im- pressive and revealing book.. Summoned: Encounters with Alien Intelligence by Dana Redfield, Hampton Roads, 1999,6X9 paper- back, $13.95. Reviewed by Dwight Connelly This is not a book for those who think science can provide all the answers. Like Betty Andreasson Luca, Redfield has a message, but it is presented as alleg- edly received, not as gospel. \"Read it and see what you think\" is the author's basic attitude, since she seems as perplexed as anyone. \"If it sounds like I've got all of this figured out, don't believe it,\" she says. \"I'm doing my best to communi- cate my clearest perceptions....! suppose if I were truly humble, I would keep silent. But if I were that humble, I would fail in my function as one of many messen- gers.\" She is also well aware of the traditional status of contactees in ufology: \"As a member of MUFON, I am well aware of the skeptical attitude toward tele- pathic communications by the public and among UFO investigators and researchers who are working to gain the respect of the scientific community through the pre- sentation of 'hard facts.' There is hardly an article written, or show aired on TV, that does not include apologetic remarks about the 'lunatic fringe.' Some- times such comments are directed at anyone who claims contact with 'meta-terrestrials.'....Like it or not, and mostly I did not, I was one who was schooled, and physically prepared, to convey certain information. I had a choice. In choosing to write Summoned, I trusted that readers would be savvy enough to judge for them- selves the merits and authenticity of anything I share about myself, or under the alien signature. Because I have no way of confirming the actual identity of my sources, or their motives, each person must discern for himself or herself the truth, or distortion, of any given"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal November 1999 Page 15 message. Redrield notes that \"most often we have heard from those who are working on the 'nuts and bolts' aspects of the UFO phenomenon. If science were able to ad- dress every facet of our being and reality, there would be no call for a book like this one. In relating my ex- periences, I will explore several theories, but the one that provokes me the most is an element of the phe- nomenon that may herald something far grander than the stories we hear about cosmic kidnappings for the sole purpose of creating hybrids to bolster an alien species at an evolutionary dead end, or to supplant us. If indeed a new human-alien prototype is in the mak- ing-and I have reason to believe it may be true-it is being conducted by means of the creative principles of nature that govern Earth's web of life.\" In attempting to look rationally at what has appar- ently been years of abduction experiences, she consid- ers the possible role of our own government, since she and her family have worked for the government in vari- ous capacities, including the military. However, she concludes, \"If government is responsible for my phe- nomenal experiences, we have severely underestimated these people. If [this is] true, someone in the govern- ment is very interested in our spiritual development. Someone is interested in our souls. Someone in the government is calling us to remember that love is the only force by which we survive in community, or as sovereign individuals. Does this sound like a message government agents would send in a mind-control ex- periment? She wonders if her Mormon background somehow makes her a target for the aliens. She feels frustration in trying to make sense of her experiences scientifi- cally. \"Scientists would be the last to take seriously such reports,\" she notes. \"To thoroughly study this business a man or woman of science would have to depart from both lab and established methods. But if he or she did that-would that be scientific? Redfield divides her life into four stages: Stage One was birth to 1984, a period in which she had missing time episodes and other experiences. Stage Two be- gan on Aug. 22, 1986, when she awoke to find evi- dence of implants in both her hands. She explains that \"almost immediately following this event I was com- pelled to study quantum physics, strange for someone with an artistic temperament. But I did not connect the dots from the evidence of implants to this new in- terest. I was also drawn to study ancient history, ge- netics, mythology, and related subjects....The more I moved—or was moved—toward disclosure of my in- volvement with aliens, the wider the gap in interests, values, and goals with my husband. Divorce was the outcome in 1992. The Third Stage involved the impulse to work with letters and numbers-\"kaballah-like exercises that I would later interpret as a kind of schooling that pre- pared me for all that has happened since.\" Like most abductees, Redfield has paid a price for her experiences, as she explains: \"Abductees are challenged with a horrendous breach in the fabric of our beliefs and the lives we created, as a result of those beliefs. It is not surprising that some of us have ended up in mental institutions, or commit- ting suicide. For many of us, the trouble is not so much the shock of discovering we can be taken against our conscious wills by beings we did not even know ex- isted, as it is the rejection felt from members of soci- ety who have no reason to believe us. \"Many lives have been torn apart, many abductees have become virtual recluses, living on the edges of society with their unacceptable secrets. But can I blame people for their disbelief and skepticism. What in their lives gives clue that such things can happen? \"Depending on the degree, frequency, and intensity of abduction activity, marriages and families may break apart, careers may be interrupted, and dear friendships may not survive the trials....For the abductee, the chal- lenge is not one of debate between belief and disbe- lief. It is a matter of who do you tell, how much do you tell, and are you ready to risk everything—family, marriage, friends, reputation, careers, and even dreams? For if you appeal to minds not prepared for the shock of such revelations, you stand to lose all.\" These concerns cause Redfield to ask herself a ba- sic question, one which many abductees ask frequently: \"When did I really make this choice [to co-operate]? Before I was born? That would explain the split-mind I experienced from the onset of the phenomena, one part of me shocked, feeling myself swept on a wave, the other part clam, knowing, and devoted.\" Redfield is very candid in discussing her own life. At a point when she was especially stressed because of contact, her parents told her she had to get a job, and not spend all her time writing. \"From their per- spective,\" she notes, \"that made perfect sense. For me, it was one more pressure....Compassion for how hard all this business was on my family and friends came later. I was too out of kilter to see their side; too baffled, too challenged, and I was developing a bad case of the 'poor-me's.' These were the alien days.\" This was the time when Redfield spent months work- ing on an alphabet and numbers, creating charts, graphs, symbols, and art without knowing why she felt com- (Continued on Page 16)"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Page 16 November 1999 MUFON UFO Journal Forum... (Continued from Page 13) While the odds might be in favor of such a tie-in, it is still speculation. Since the hair seems to have been planted (how else could it have gotten tightly wrapped around the penis), we really don't know what is be- hind this event. It's also interesting to speculate that the owner of the hair is a possible hybrid, but again there is not much to show this. If the hair is, in fact, from a hybrid, this would seem to negate research by Jacobs and others that indicates there are a lot of hybrids out there, since the DNA in this case is apparently in very short supply among the human population. Also, if the hair did belong to the blonde on the bed, she seemed to be more of a \"mechanical\"creation than a hybrid. Like much of ufolo~gy, this case is a puzzler and frus- trating. Anyway, it is a good one as far as it goes, and I would hope that other DNA tie-ins will surface. Your report should at least serve to add DNA to our list of research tools. Dwight Exeter action Dear Editor: Concerning the article submitted by Mr. Preston Dennett (October Journal); 1 am moved to inteject a crucial correction: Exeter, NH, did have a glaringly significant feature of \"military activity.\" My commen- tary, here, is based primarily on the experience of hav- ing conducted extensive investigation into the Exeter (i. e., NH Seacoast) area UFO activity for a period of some fifteen years, starting in 1969. 1 have lived and worked in the immediate Exeter, NH, locality since Jan. 1969. The \"Incident at Exeter\" occurred 9/3/65. 1 applaud the initiative of Mr. Dennett's \"compara- tive study .... of hotspots.\" This Exeter area certainly was a hotspot, and Mr. Dennett's comments remind me of how I marveled at the brazenness that the UFO-Aliens exhibited during the extreme peaking of their local activity. For the stretch of a few weeks, the UFO-Aliens had virtually taken control of a tiny patch of this planet-as soon as it got dark. In brief: well before and after \"The Incident at Exeter\" there was .a Strategic Air Command Base (Pease) at Newington, NH, (i. e., near Portsmouth, about 13 miles from Exeter); and its low-level landing pattern passed over : near desolate swamps of the im- mediate Exeter area. The UFO-Aliens repeatedly uti- lized a few of these swamps as \"nocturnal hiding-pens\" while, one presumes, they monitored the SAC activity (recall the Vietnam era, and the Atomic Submarine facility at Portsmouth should be noted, also). The ci- vilian Americans, therefore, did prominently encoun- ter the UFO-Alien manifestation (UFOs) during such exercises-which definitely included \"The Incident at Exeter.\" Thus, THEIR brazen exhibition was an ad- junct of THEIR necessity of the surveillance. In the spring of 1966 a substantial force of the 509th Bomb Wing relocated to Pease. The 509th had dropped the Atomic Bombs on Japan. So wartime (Vietnam, and the fall of 1973) Exeter WAS NOT just a \"typical small town.\" John Paul Oswald The UFO Press: Summoned... (Continued from Page 15) pelled to do so. Researcher Linda Moulton Howe, writing in the Preface to Summoned, likens the activity that Redfield was doing with symbols to that described by Jim Sparks, a Florida abductee, as well as similar to what Becky Andreasson, daughter of Betty Andreasson, was reportedly doing. Perhaps the heart of this book is Chapter 11, \"The History of Humankind in Summary,\" which Redfield describes as \"the longest message I've ever translated...and central to my understanding of the purpose of UFO sightings and abductions.\" Part I of this chapter came in the fall of 1993, while the rest came three years later. Part I describes the beginnings of humankind and the \"severing of communications\" between us and our \"makers.\" Part II describes a breach that occurred in our development, and the creation of a \"third species,\" called the \"second order of humankind.\" Parts III and IV expand on this \"genetic miracle.\" The history also includes prophecies. Redfield says the history is \"not a statement of bio- logical or historical fact. I feel it's best to read it from the heart. Like everything else in this book, it is of- fered as food for thought. Maybe it's only a parable to warn about dangerous misuse of knowledge coming out of the human genome project. Or maybe it's just another Big Fish story. You will decide.\" There is much in this book to ponder. Those who relate to the works of Zecharia Sitchin will probably also relate well to Summoned. This presentation can serve as a bridge of sorts for those who are willing to look beyond the basic aspects of abductions-taking Redfield's account as food for thought, rather than as a final answer."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal November 1999 Page 17 Filer's Files By George A.

Thanks to Tom Carey. Roswell investigation Tom Carey and Don Schmitt have just returned from another research trip to Roswell. Along with local in- vestigators Dennis Balthaser of Roswell and Nina Coleman of Albuquerque, the team continues to proactively research this most famous UFO case. New witnesses continue to be located and interviewed. A former government person recalls having to vacate his employment area in Northern Virginia for one day many years ago to allow the wreckage of a crashed UFO to be moved out and relocated. Renewed focus is being placed upon the events in the Corona area as opposed to farther southeast of Roswell. One day was spent in the high desert trying to locate the exact crash site. They believe that the true crash site was about 35 miles northwest of Roswell. Nevada UFO video NAVAL AIR STATION FALLON - On Aug. 29, 1999, Chris Miller and his client Syena Sowden were on a video shoot on the desert three miles away from the base at 6:30 PM. Syena saw the UFO first. Chris states, \"I was already holding the camcorder, so I just pointed it towards the UFO.\" It was traveling extremely fast, perhaps 600 mph at around 30,000 feet. The object was a cigar-shaped craft. Close exami- nation of the video reveals two plasmas can be seen. Thanks to Chris Miller. College course in UFOs John A.

Ten circles were found in a wheat field on Sept. 3, 1999, by Dave Robertson. Three \"arms\" of circles come out from a larger central circle. The center circle is about 35 feet in diameter; the others range from 4 feet to 22 feet. The \"top\" two circles and the center circle are clock- wise, the others are all counterclockwise, all with very neat swirling and flattening of the crop. This is the sev- enth Canadian report for 1999, and the first this year from Saskatchewan, usually the center of activity.

As always, their appearance was greeted with video cameras to solidly document them. On July 22, a triangular craft was spotted in the cit- ies of Tsfat and Yokneam at 7:30 PM. It was video- taped in both places. A professional photographer, Rafi Malka, video taped it from his home in Acceded. He earned the distinction of being the first Israeli to vid- eotape two separate UFOs. He then phoned his nephew, Doron Cohen, in Yavne, who spread the word in that city that a UFO was com- ing. Among those he contacted was professor Rami Shkalim, who has a Ph.D. in both physics and philoso- phy and is currently a professor of Kabbala at Bar Ilan University. He was one of over two hundred people who viewed the craft until it disappeared at 12:30 AM. He had just purchased professional equipment, a Sony 320 zoom video camera that recorded an absolutely brilliant ten minute videotape of the craft. The craft had two sil- very lights, both surrounded by a perfectly circular red aura twice their size. When the craft seems to turn, a triangle of lights is visible. Then the craft becomes two lights. (Continued on Page 18)"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Page 18 November 1999 MUFON UFO Journal Filer's Files...

She thought it might be a plane until she realized it was not moving. It stayed in one spot in the sky for about ten minutes. The sun was just coming up at 6:45 AM. Th witness explains: \"The UFO was shaped like a hamburger with a row of circle lights across the middle. There were sirens and lights flashing, so I thought the police knew about it and were looking at the same thing. I got my daughter so she could see it too and she called the family next door. We all watched it ascend straight up without any noise and change to a diamond shape. The next morning I looked up in the same spot and there it was again, but higher. It started coming straight down and wobbling side to side. I called the police to report it and when the officer arrived it had moved back up higher into the sky.

Is it the Sumerian Nibiru described by Zecharia Sitchin? By CNl News The astronomy world buzzed with excitement on Oct. 7 as newly announced evidence from two sepa- rate research teams appeared to confirm the existence of a huge planet-like body far beyond the orbit of Pluto. For decades, astronomers have speculated that such a planet must exist. \"Wobbles\" in the known outer plan- ets seem to require it. Now, observations of incoming comets apparently ejected from the extremely remote Oort Cloud by some strong gravitational force lend credence to the idea of a giant planet circling our solar system at a distance of perhaps three trillion miles, or half a light year. Dr. John Murray of Britain's Open University said, \"Although I have only analysed 13 comets in detail, the effect is pretty conclusive. I have calculated that there is only about a one in 1,700 chance that it is due to chance.\" In a recent research paper in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Murray suggests that the so-far unseen planet is several times larger than Jupiter. Furthermore, he says, the planet appears to orbit the sun in the \"wrong\" direction, opposite the orbit of all the known planets. This could mean that the huge object may be a so-called \"rogue planet\" that drifted in from very deep space and was captured by the sun's gravity. Similar conclusions have been separately reached by physicists John Matese, Daniel Whitmire and Patrick Whitman at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. The findings of John Matese and colleagues will be published in an upcoming edition of the journal Icarus. In that article, Matese refers to the object as possibly a \"brown dwarf' and estimates its mass at three times that of Jupiter. According to Murray, if the presumed planet were in a circular orbit, it would take nearly six million years to circle the sun. Also, despite its enormous size, it would be extremely faint, giving off no light of its own, and probably could not be detected even by the Hubble Telescope. But the next generation of space-based tele- scopes, which would include ultra-sensitive infrared sensors, might be able to find it. Meanwhile, the discussion of a huge new planet has aroused the particular interest of researchers familiar with the work of Sumerian scholar Zecharia Sitchin. In a series of books called The Earth Chronicles Sitchin has eloquently argued that the ancient Sumerian civi- lization knew very well about this huge outer planet and described it-and its extraterrestrial inhabitants, whom they called the Anunnaki or Nefilim-in great detail. Neil Freer (freerl@concentric.net) has studied Sitchin's work for more than two decades and has writ- ten a book, Breaking the Godspell (Falcon Press, 1987), in which he further develops the possible implications of Nibiru's influence upon past and current humanity. On hearing of the discoveries of David Murray, John Matese et al, Freer wasted no time publicly pointing out the obvious parallels with the predicted existence ofNibiru: \"I wish to call to your attention that Zecharia Sitchin, Sumerian scholar and author of The Earth Chronicle Series of books, revealed the existence, size, orbit, and detailed characteristics of the tenth planet in our solar system 25 years ago through the translation of the Enuma Elish (When in the heights....), a major docu- ment unearthed at the archaeological digs at Nineveh by Layard, and translated by L.W. King. \"It gives a complete account of the formation of our solar system, including the gravitational capture into the system of this tenth planet (known to the Sumerians as Nibiru and the Babylonians as Marduk); its subse- quent collision with a large planet, Tiamat, orbiting then between Mars and Jupiter; the formation of the asteroid belt, comets and meteorites from the impact; [and] the translation of the larger part of the impacted native planet into our orbit to become Earth. \"The Enuma Elish says that the intruder planet settled into a huge elliptical orbit of 3600 years around our sun in the 'wrong' direction, counter to the orbital direction of the other planets, [and] that it returns to the inner solar system through the asteroid belt area periodically. It gives the details of the path it can be observed taking through the constellations as it ap- proaches and the disruptive events its close passing causes on Earth. Tombaugh, searching for the tenth Planet X, dis- covered Pluto in 1930. Sitchin definitively answers the question, \"How could our earliest civilizations know of this planet?\" with the thoroughly substantiated thesis that the transcultural \"gods\" known to all the ancient civiliza- tions were not mythological but flesh and blood hu- manoids whose home planet was, is, indeed, this tenth planet. They came here 432,000 years ago, created our spe- cies as a slave race for their gold mines by crossing their genes with those of Homo Erectus, moved us up to limited partnership subsequently and taught us civi- lization and science and astronomy, eventually phased offand left us on our own to find our own species iden- tity."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Page 20 November 1999 MUFON UFO Journal Perspective On the October MUFON UFO Journal By Richard H. Hall it is good to see Ted Phillips \"back in the saddle\" and contributing to hardcore UFO research. In his re- port, note the powerful effects of the \"ridicule factor\" in preventing citizens from speaking out about the strange phenomena they are observing (or experiencing). The negative effects of of- ficial ridicule on our under- standing of UFO phenomena have been profound. If these same officials had any inkling of what was really going on, the course of UFO history would be quite different. Richard Hall Now that it appears to be certain that my new documen- tary report, The UFO Evi- dence: Volume 11, will be pub- lished by Scarecrow Press sometime in Y2K, I can say with confidence that my review of sighting data since 1964 has firmly established very strong patterns in the data and numerous repetitive features. These patterns are tantamount to proof that UFOs are a real and po- tentially highly important scientific fact badly in need of high-level scientific (not to mention social and po- litical) attention. A number of those features are present in Phillips' and Filer's reports in this issue, and they have no idea of what is in my book! Kudos to MUFON and its Connecticut and Massa- chusetts units for their efforts to train investigative per- sonnel in scientific methods and critical analysis tech- niques in an academic setting. This is the right way to go. Science and UFOs have had an uneasy relationship for more than 50 years now, and ihib gap urgently needs to be bridged. The enhanced Lubbock lights image presented by Donald Burleson does, indeed, resemble a honeycomb. I applaud his efforts to introduce new photoanalysis techniques in cases like this, and no criticism of him personally is intended at all when I stress the need for carefully determining if this image could be artificially introduced by the processing methods. If not, the find- ing takes on great significance. On the other hand, it definitely is not \"well known\" that Frank Kaufmann's description of the Roswell object included a honeycomb structure, or even that Bob Shirley had published a book in which drawings of it were reproduced. From my knowledge of Shirley's testimony on the case, he saw only packaged materi- als being carried onto the aircraft bound for Fort Worth. Burleson asks: \"How long indeed should we wait before speculating constructively and reasonably about these things...?\" (meaning in his case links between the Lubbock Lights and Roswell). Speculation is okay when clearly labelled as such and not pretending to offer final \"answers.\" I engaged in speculation in my book, Uninvited Guests, and agree that we need to \"forge connections, discern patterns, and formulate hypotheses.\" But these same speculations and hypotheses must be subject to peer review, and in that spirit I am skep- tical that a logical link has been established between the Lubbock Lights and Roswell. At the same time, I am a \"skeptic\" in the philo- sophical tradition of desiring more complete data, rather than a CSICOP-style debunker masquerading as a skeptic. If the apparent honeycomb structure is real rather than an artifact, that is very important to know. Then we need to evaluate the Kaufmann report(s) carefully, since he is not exactly accepted by all parties as a completely credible witness, in order to decide whether a convincing case exists for linking the Lubbock Lights photo and Roswell. Preston Dennett's UFO wave report contains use- ful data, but clearly his statement, \"I found that al- most no research has been done on UFO waves,\" in- dicates a lack of awareness of UFO literature. I have written extensively on UFO waves in Uninvited Guests, The UFO Evidence, the International UFO Reporter, and elsewhere. Jerome Clark, perhaps even more so, has written extensively on UFO waves, as has Eddie Bullard. None of these are cited in his sources. I also take strong issue with his (and others') defi- nition of UFO hotspots. Practically any place where there are active UFO investigators whose reports are published can be perceived as \"hotspots.\" The defini- tion is so loose as to be almost meaningless. (See my study of close-range UFO sightings by state versus population in Uninvited Guests,} One final thought: I note the announcement of a new MUFON field investigator, Ms. Dana Mosher in Ottumwa, IA. Ottumwa was the hometown of my friend and mentor, Maj. Donald E. Keyhoe, USMC (Ret.) with whom I worked for many years. Congratu- lations Dana, and please carry on his tradition."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal November 1999 Page 21 DR.

The ruddy planet lies very near the lunar crescent on the 12th. Jupiter (-2.6), in Pisces, dominates the SE sky at twilight and beyond, moving westward during the night. The big world resumes eastward orbital motion on Dec. 21-an effect of our Earth passing Jupiter as they both swing around the Sun. Saturn (0.2), in Aries, is visible in the ESE at dusk. Like its giant companion Jupiter, the ringed planet continues westward across the southern heavens dur- ing the night. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Rarely seen Mercury has its best morning appear- ance of the year during the first half of the month. Us- ing binoculars, look for a tiny orange dot low in the SE at twilight. Venus (-4.1) rises in the E about 3:30 AM (in mid-December) and takes over as the brightest planet or star in the sky after Jupiter sets. Venus can be seen in the SE at dawn. Jupiter advances to the W where it vanishes below the horizon near 2 AM. Saturn sets in the WNW about 3:30 in midmonth. Meteor Shower: The Geminids represent an annual meteor shower that is visible most of the night. But wait until the Moon is out of the way after about 9:30 PM Dec. 13. The best time to glimpse the most meteors is during the late morning hours of the 14th when about 50 to 100 meteors per hour might be seen flying out of the con- stellation Gemini. Mars Polar Lander: Launched Jan. 3, the Mars Polar Lander is due to land on the red planet Dec. 3. As the spacecraft de- scends near the south pole, two \"microprobes\" are to be released to stick into the surface of Mars. The de- vices will try to detect any water ice that might be present in the soil. Once on the surface the lander im- ages the site, studies atmospheric conditions, listens for sounds with a microphone, and scoops up soil samples for analysis. Its companion, Mars Climate Orbiter, failed to achieve orbit Sept. 23 owing to a simple programming error that escaped NASA's usually rigorous error-detection process. Mars Global Surveyor, how- ever, continues its highly successful orbiting mission above Mars. Moon Phases: New moon - Dec. 7 First quarter - Dec. 15 Full moon - Dec. 22 ... Nearest Moon of the year Last quarter - Dec. 29 The Stars: By midevening two great seasonal sky symbols are present at the same time-the autumn pattern known as the Great Square of Pegasus, high in the W, and winter's own Orion the Hunter in the SE. Orion is en- circled by the luminaries of the Winter Circle-Sirius, Procyon, Pollux and Castor, Capella, Aldebaran, and Rigel. Beware of misidentifying Sirius the Dog Star as it rises in the ESE (at 8 PM in midmonth). Its brilliance and atmospheric refractive effects frequently result in false UFO reports. * This is the 15th anniversary of The Night Sky.

Scarpellini (High Ridge, MO); and Richard L. King, (Tucson, AZ). Congratulations to the largest monthly group of people passing the exam. In recognition, each person passing the exam will receive a MUFON lapel pin. A message from Kathleen Marden, Director of Field Investigator Training regarding exam results: Mrs. Marden cannot divulge the correct answers to the questions that a person answered incorrectly, be- cause this would obviously make it possible for a per- son to share the correct answers with a friend. If the examinee wants his or her test score promptly, please enclose a self-addressed, stamped envelope or an e-mail. Address. New MUFON Field Investigator's Exam Dan Wright, Deputy Director, Investigations, has composed a new 100-question Field Investigator's Exam designed around the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual (Fourth Edition). It will be in- troduced on Jan. 1,2000. Kathleen Marden will continue to accept the current examination indefinitely; however, we encourage those who have not submitted their exam answer sheets to do so in the near future. Both Kathleen and I screened the new test and made appropriate revisions for clarification purposes. The format still consists of multiple choice, true-false, and \"fill in the blanks\" type questions. UFO Sighting Reports After the State and Provincial Directors evaluate the UFO sighting reports received in their respective states or provinces, the original with pertinent attachments should be mailed directly to Dan Wright, Deputy Di- rector, Investigations, at 3628 Aragon Drive, Lansing, MI 48906. A copy should be retained by the State/Pro- vincial Director for his/her file, and a copy sent to the Regional Director. This procedure has been more ef- fective in getting reports into the MUFON database more promptly. Since our members are anxious to read about cur- rent UFO sighting reports that have been investigated by MUFON Field Investigators, please mail a narra- tive report in article format to Walter Andrus for pub- lication in the MUFON UFO Journal. This also ap- plies to older cases of a significant nature that were recently investigated. Please include drawings of the object for the article. St Louis UFO Symposium Bruce A. Widaman, Missouri State Director, is proud to announce that the new millennium will be celebrated with MUFON's 2000 International UFO Symposium on July 14-16, 2000, at the Sheraton West Port Inn, Lakeside Chalet, 191 West Port Plaza, St. Louis, MO 63146, located at 1-270 and Page Ave. in Northwestern St. Louis.
