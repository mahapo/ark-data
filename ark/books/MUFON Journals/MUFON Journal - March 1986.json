FROM THE EDITOR Space considerations last issue forced us to continue Budd Hopkins article on a childhood abduction in Ohio. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused author and audience. Hopkins had hypnotically regressed the witness, \"Meg,\" who told of \"dreaming\" about three men dressed in black uniforms. The remainder of the interview concludes in this issue. Next month, we'll have a longer article (complete!) detailing Hopkins' thoughts about his prolonged study of abduction cases. The Journal's future looks exciting, and we hope you stay tuned in light of the recent rise in subscription rates. A number of good articles are already on hand and more are being actively solicited. Combined with our regular departments, we think you'll agree they make for the best reading in the field. In this issue CHALLENGER MEMORIAL, by John Schuessler  3 NORTH CAROLINA UFO, by George D.

Editor's Note: The people of, the World have shared the mourningofthe traumatic space shuttle tragedy and the loss of the seven crew members in the Challenger explosion: John F. Schuessler is an aerospace engineering manager and has been associated with all major manned U.S. space programs. It was in this capacity that'he was invited to attend the^H Memorial Services at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas on January 31, 1986. Mr. Schuessler was so impressed by the magnitude of the .guests attending, the personalized recognition bestowed upon the astronauts, their families, and the future of the space program, that he immediately recorded his personal impressions. The printed and electronic news media has covered the .memorial services for the general public. John was enticed by Walt Andrus to share his view as a participant because he relates some of : the security measures taken to protect '•••if; the President of the United States and ~ other high level dignitaries present not depicted to the news media report. Having worked closely with many of the astronauts, Mr. Schuessler was not only honored to be a guest at this solemn occasion, but to be a part of the space program in the past and in the future. This edition of the MUFON UFO Journal is a tribute in memory of the courageous Space Shuttle Mission 51- L Crew of the Challenger who lost their lives in their challenge to conquer space. The designation \"51-L\" crew is composed in the following manner: \"5\" for the planned flight in 1985; \"1\" identifies an east coast launch — Cape Canaveral, Florida, and \"L\" for the twelfeth flight of 1985 selected alphabetically.

Post photo by Carlos Resales Today is Friday, January 31, 1986 and I have just returned from the memorial service held at the Johnson Space Center for the Challenger crew. My feelings range from deep sadness for the loss of some fine colleagues to extreme pride in the space family and the country's commitment to space. I was honored to be one of the 2000 V.I.P. guests that included astronauts, astronaut families, political figures, and various leaders in the aerospace field. Never before in history have so many notables of the space family gathered in one place at one time.

PRECAUTIONS Security was tight. The invitees were pre-screened and approved on Thursday. The invitation supplied by NASA was the only ticket that would permit attendance. Everyone was required to park in a remote area and NASA supplied a bus service to the memorial site in the center of the NASA campus. Attendees then passed 20-30 security people spaced at 30 foot intervals along the walkway. The invitation was viewed by each guard. The final clearance was through metal detectors into the seating area. Before the service began a small airplane flew over the NASA property parallel to the gathering. When it started to curve around in our direction a Secret Service helicopter came out of nowhere and intercepted the plane. The helicopter kept approaching the plane until it was forced out to the Gulf of Mexcio. Then the helicopter returned and settled down again behind the buildings. Throughout the several hours of the event Secret Service people on the buildings scanned the area, looking at people in the crowds with powerful binoculars. A large crane with a platform hoisted high over the buildings was used to watch for trouble from the rear of the crowd. ASTRONAUTS It was a real pleasure to see the astronauts once again, some of them dating clear back to the Mercury program. Others from Gemini, Apollo, Skylab, and of course, Shuttle were there renewing old friendships. Our first orbiting astronaut, now U.S. Senator John Glenn was there. He was accompanied by the new Senator/ Astronaut Jake Garn. The other names were like something out of Who's Who. Shirra, Slayton, Collins, Cernan, Bean, Mattingly and Neil Armstrong, were just a few. Many of the other Apollo flyers were mixed in with the Shuttle men and women. Several of the older astronauts now have white hair and lines of experience engraved into their faces. Some had no hair at all. The Shuttle astronauts ranged from the early fifties with their hair turning gray, to the very young, recently recipients of their doctorate degrees. All were friendly, cordial and proud to be part of the space team. NASA and contractor managers covered the whole space era also. John Yardley, ex-NASA administrator, now President of McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Company, was accompanied by Jim Rose, head of the drug manufacturing space program. Bob Thompson, who originally headed the NASASpace Shuttle Program, now head of the McDonnell Douglas Space Station program was there with his chief space architects. My colleagues, Bill Hayes, Deputy General Manager, Wayne Huning, Deputy Program Manager, and Ron Petersburg, Programs Director, all of McDonnell Douglas Astronautics in Houston all cover much of the historic era of space.

Fawcett is MUFON's Assistant State Director for North Carolina and a Field Investigator with numerous published articles to his credit. On Wednesday evening, May 1, 1985 at 9:30 p.m. the Lincoln County Communication Center in Lincolnton, N.C., suddenly came alive as a series of calls came in from Lincolnton police and Lincoln County police complaining about suspected low-flying planes being seen at various locations in Lincolnton, Boger City, Alexis, Stanley and Iron Station. The reports indicated a great deal of confusion about just what was being seen in the first place. Courity officer Larry Stanley expressed .it best by saying he thought it was a jet, but at times appeared to be standing still and when it moved it was flying too low and- was soundless. Officer Stanley couldn't identify the strange silver object in the evening sky. This event set the stage for what was yet to happen later in the evening just four miles from downtown Lincolnton. LOUD NOISES At 11:45 p.m. four residents living at the Hidden Valley Horse Arena, off Highway 182 West were startled by loud noises and bright lights outside their homes. Mrs. Joe (Judy) Scronce was the first to see it, as it revolved vertically outside her bedroom window. She was unable to awaken her husband, as she watched what she described as \"like a steel battleship\" in the sky; it gave off \"heat waves\" and made a sound \"like a jet plane crashing\" that vibrated the (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"CAROLINA, Continued foundation of their home. The Scronce home suffered a complete power failure. Judy hid behind the bedroom curtains, while the strange object hovered outside, but peeped out from time to time and was able to see that the neighborhood dogs, which normally bark at anything, now were strangely silent. She next walked outdoors and watched the \"Saturn-shaped UFO\" as it leveled out and moved horizontally towards the home of her. daughter and son-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Danny (Lucienda) Alderholdt, where it suddenly cast \"a beam of white light\" from .the center of its bottom down on the roof of the Alderholdt mobile home. Mrs. Scronce tried to call her daughter on the telephone, but the phone wouldn't work. Moments later Lucienda tried to call her_ mother on the phone with the same results, as she and Danny heard a sound \"like a freight train\" coming in their house. Lucienda noticed that her electric clock, which .resets itself automatically to 12 and then starts blinking when the power goes off was doing exactly that. Prior to the arrival of the object outside the Alderholdt home, the UFO passed over the home of Mrs. Teresa Scronce, making a sound \"like a bunch of transfer trucks with no mufflers.\" The sound frightened Teresa so badly that she refused to turn her house lights on and hid in her bathroom. She didn't even try to look for the source of the sound, but did remember to lock the front door of her home. In the excitement of the \"close encounter\" outside the Alderholdt home, Lucienda locked the doors of their home, without even noticing that her husband Danny had already gone out barefooted to investigate the disturbance. Lucienda hid behind their front door. One of the first things that Danny Alderholdt noticed was that the horses in the fields outside seemed frozen to the spot and were gazing upwards looking in the direction of the UFO. As the UFO moved towards his mobile home it had to lift up from a 35-foot altitude to about a 60-foot altitude to avoid hitting the nearby trees. As it did, Danny noticed that the pressure directed down from the UFO not only affected his eardrums, but also parted the treetops \"like a comb\" in their side yard. HEATWAVES Danny, 25, walked to within an estimated 100 feet of the UFO, which was now again hovering about 35 feet off the ground in a nearby field about 80 feet from his home. The UFO was now revolving with a \"humming sound\" in a horizontal position in the western sky. Alderholdt said it gave off \"waves of heat\" after which time Danny felt a \"sudden chill.\" Alderholdt, who got the best view of the object said it was \"big enough to fill Yankee stadium.\" The UFO had \"a row of windows\" that revolved around its middle section and flashed red, white, yellow, blue and violet colors as it hovered above the field for about 20 more minutes. When the . Saturn-shaped UFO started to leave the area it banked and lifted at a 75-degree angle.arid moved away in a Northwestern direction. As it did both the lights and noise intensified. It made a \"rumbling sound\" as it departed at 12:15 a.m. I conducted field investigations at the site ,of the encounters and interviewed not only the eyewitnesses, but also the earwitnesses (who only heard the UFO), Then I followed up with interviews with the Lincolnton police, the Lincoln County police, the Lincoln County Communication Center personnel, the Lincoln County Sheriff's Department, the manager of the Lincolnton Duke Power Company and also placed a call to radar tower personnel at the Douglas International Airport at Charlotte. At Douglas I spoke to Joe Crosby, a quality assurance training specialist with radar at the airport. Crosby said that Charlotte radar would have been unable to \"paint a target\" at such low altitude in the Lincolnton area, which is located 36 miles away from Charlotte. Crosby did however confirm that some Charlotte residents had complained of \"loud noises\" in the skies at the same time that UFO witnesses in the Lincolnton area were experiencing the same problem. T. Glen Parker at the Lincolnton Duke Power Co. when asked if power outages had been reported from the UFO site at the time of the encounters said no, but after being reminded that telephone disruptions had also happened at the same time, said this would explain the lack of communications. Asked if the power failures would show up on the witnesses' bills, Parker replied that it would probably not, because.of the short duration of the loss of power (30 minutes), plus the fact that when the power came back on, it would automatically use a larger amount of power to restore it back to normal. Over a period of years, a number of excellent UFO sightings have occurred within a mile or two of the Hidden Valley Horse Arena, but this May 1 encounter represents the \"most significant\" sighting, because of the many different factors involved in the 1985 observations. The low altitude, long-duration UFO encounter with the additional aspects of power failures, telephone interruptions, animal reactions, independent eyewitnesses and similar descriptions in regards to human reactions, sounds, shapes, sizes, heat waves, \"beams of light,\" and physiological effects indicate something extremely interesting happened in Lincoln County on the night of May 1. To date what happened still remains unexplained. It was easily the best sighting of a UFO in North Carolina in 1985 (both reported and investigated) and it left in its wake a number of badly frightened and confused eyewitnesses. INVESTIGATOR'S NOTE The two witnesses who saw the UFO were interviewed separately, before they had time to discuss it with each other. Out of a chart that contained 54 different illustrations of typical UFO shapes reported before, these two witnesses picked the same Saturn-shaped illustration independ- ently.

Editor's note: UFOs, we sometimes forget, are still a controversial subject, and nowhere is this more evident than in the area of their possible origins. It is one thing to say they are extraterrestrial, for example, quite another to pinpoint their exact source, whether it be a remote planet light-years removed, or somewhere much closer to home. In the following article Mr. Abutaha presents his own approach to the problem and arrives at a surprising solution. His conclusion is his own and is not to be taken as that of the Mutual UFO Network or the editor of the Journal. If his paper inspires others to propose alternative theories or to disprove his own, however, constructive criticism in the field, we believe, will have been served. We welcome both articles and letters of comments in response. PART II SOLAR LIFE Based on lengthy and careful stydy of diverse scientific and technical subjects and concepts, I had arrived at the conclusion that the development and evolution of life on the Sun is a possibility. The possible existence of a biosphere on the Sun is described in another article. Although the solar life hypothesis is based on valid scientific grounds, it runs contrary to the prevailing common sense and common beliefs of our time. Some senior scientists reacted to the hypothesis by pointing out the upper temerature limits for life and for biological processes as we knew them only a few years ago: 55°C, 73°C, and an upper limit of 100 °C for the simplest life forms. Other scientists articulated different objections which have not been fatal to the hypothesis. In the beginning, the hypothesis appeared to be pseudoscientific, if not altogether nonscientific. EQUILIBRIUM • The average conditions of pressure, temperature, and density of sea level on Earth specify a thermodynamic state of equilibrium. The Solar Life hypothesis postulates that a similar, but not identical, state of equilibrium exists on the Sun. To explain this concept, think of two containers with boiling water; one at sea level and the other on top of Mt. Everest. At sea level, water boils at 100°C, while on Mt. Everest the boiling temperature is 71°C. We can say, that while boiling, the two water samples are in similar, but not identical, states of equilibrium. To the human eye, the two samples appear to be similar, boiling water. In reality, the two water samples are different, as a result of the differences in pressure and temperature. Here, the difference is small and is not perceptible to the naked eye. But, if we apply a pressure of 2 atmospheres to a water sample, as in the case of a pressure cooker, then water boils at 121°C. Again, this water sample is in a similar, but not identical, state to those at sea level and on top of Mt. Everest. One can imagine a vessel with very high pressure acting on a water sample in it. Such a sample will boil at a very high temperature, due to the higher pressure. When the boiling temperature reaches very high values, say, thousands of degrees, the water sample will appear to the human eye, in the visible spectrum, to be \"glowing, self-luminous, and fire-like,\" like molten steel or molten lava. There are seemingly valid technical objections to this scenario, such as the critical point of water. These are discussed in other articles of mine, and so are the other factors which constitute the elements of a life support system, a biosphere, on the Sun. In the late 1970's and early 80's, the solar life hypothesis was rejected out of hand; for life, intelligent or otherwise, could not exist beyond an upper limit of 73°C, or even, 100°C. We do not have a solar life sample to ascertain the fantastic possiblity. The recent discovery of complex living organisms near under-sea hydrothermal volcanic vents and the pursuant studies of these organisms have recently elevated the accepted upper temperature limit for life to 350°C. On a logarithmic scale, this is a quantum jump towards the minimum conditions which are known to exist on the Sun. In order to study the vents' creatures in our laboratories, life support systems simulating their environment must be constructed. These organisms cannot be kept in open vessels, as the boiling temperature can only reach 100°C. In order to simulate the vents' environment, say, 300°C and 200 atmospheres, pressure vessels or life support systems must be built for the purpose. Now think of it: suppose that we discover living organisms closer in to the hydrothermal vents, where the temperature may be above 1,500°C? These creatures will then appear to our eyes to be \"glowing, self-luminous, and fire-like,\" and so will any life support system that we may construct to house these organisms in our laboratories. This is not a farfetched idea. Only three years ago, life at 350 degrees was considered equally improbable. Another point of interest here was that some scientists suggested that even if life can form on the Sun, its duration would be \"but a split second.\" This view is based on calculations of a rate of metabolism that takes only (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"UFOS, Continued temperature into account. The solar life hypothesis takes into account the extreme temperatures, pressures, and magnetic fields to deduce that a similar, but not identical, rate of metabolism for the proposed solar life to that at sea level on Earth, may indeed be the case. This has been shown to be the case with the hydrothermal vents' organisms. If ortly temperatures alone are considered, then these creatures would be \"cooked\" in a fraction of a minute, at best a fraction of an hour. To see a fish swimming comfortably in 300°C (nearly 600 degrees Fahrenheit), or even in. boiling water at 100°C, is alien to .our common sense, which expects the fish to be cooked in a fraction of an hour. It is already known .and scientifically established that the life span, the rate of metabolism, of the vents' organisms is similar to that of their relatives at sea level. . BREAKTHROUGH The hydrothermal vents discoveries represent a breakthrough to the Solar Life hypothesis. Prior to these discoveries, it was difficult, if hot impossible, for me to conquer the built- in bias in the collective common sense. Complex life at high temperatures was considered to be the product of wild and fanciful imagination. A senior biologist said in personal correspond- ence that he could not even imagine a complex creature at 100°C, let alone hundreds or thousands of degrees. The visualizability of solar life, more a function of common sense and common beliefs than knowledge, has been very problematic. The solar life hypothesis describes a possible \"Darwinian Pond\" on the Sun. Byond this, a little imagination leads to intelligent and technologically advanced solar beings, who may be the designers, builders, and operators of the mysterious objects which have been reported ,, by thousands of witnesses in modern and historic times. But, whether the solar life hypothesis is correct or wrong, we have seen the possible fault in the serious scientific attempts of the last forty years to solve the UFO enigma. 8 WHAT WENT WRONG / I said earlier that the pitfall in the serious and/or scientific analyses which have been conducted to date to decipher the UFO enigma in the last forty years was in the \"case by case\" approach. Such effort is similar to that of trying to guess the final portrait of a large jigsaw puzzle by careful and lengthy study of one piece of the puzzle at a time. Unless the puzzle is made up of that one piece, the effort will most likely be unproductive. This \"single case\" approach was, perhaps, the main fault .in past analysis. But, there were other faults. The UFO phenomenon has presented the i human mind with paradoxes. Resolving paradoxes does not lead to, or prove, a given hypothesis. A genuine scientific solution, 1 on the other hand, explains , such paradoxes. The intelligent behavior of some of the UFOs is perhaps the most paradoxical aspect of the phenomenon. The ancient scientist, who thought the firmament to be merely some twenty-five miles above our heads, would have had no difficulty imagining visits to our planet by extraterrestrials. It is interesting to note that the progress of science. and technology in the last two centuries has only added to our perplexity. Let me illustrate. Space travel is already a possibility which the human mind can fully comprehend. But, the vastness of space and the limitations of relativistic mechanics made it very unlikely for our minds to conceive of round trips to even nearby stars in the lifetime of a generation, or several generations. The periodic appearance of the intelligent UFOs became paradoxical. What madness if somewhere in the universe budgets were allocated for space caravans aimed to arrive at Earth every so many years. To get around this problem we find solutions which speak of parallel worlds and instantaneous travel, Star Trek style. Such excursions of the imagination are attempts to resolve the \"periodic\" appearance of the mysterious objects without due consideration to the nature of the objects themselves. As noted earlier, objects from Earth-like planets will not appear to the human eye to be \"glowing, self-luminous, and fire-like.\" Theoretical or empirical hypotheses should not be derived from paradoxes; rather, they should explain them. Solar life; which is merely some eight-light- minutes away, from Earth provides a satisfactory answer to the \"periodic\" visits. A paradox resolved. . .' '  .> HEAT In ,this article, we selected as a variable the appearance of the objects as described by the witnesses. We developed a data set which made it easy to perceive a normal trend in the data which, in turn, made it possible for us to conclude that high temperatures, are inherent to the objects and their perpetrators. The data set was independent of the age, sex, religion, profession, education,.and the state of mind of the. witnesses; or the location, .date, time, and weather conditions for •the sightings;;or number, shape, and size of the objects. Similar analyses can be performed using the other characteristics reported by the witnesses, one at a time. The temperature of the . objects . makes them appear to us'to glow, but it should'also cause burning, scorching, blighting, and other intense heat effects to nearby surroundings on Earth. Is this not the normal trend reported by the effects of the objects on terrestrial surroundings? Here, we should not expect 'the catastrophic effects that total exposure to their thermal environment would produce, for heat exchange considerations, which are necessary to regulate the temperature in their life support system, allow only the leakage of certain amounts of heat. If their protective- shields were to develop the slightest crack, then, they and their objects would disintegrate into their atoms and molecules, leaving no trace. And this may explain.the missing \"nuts and bolts\" problem of the mysterious objects. Perhaps, another paradox resolved. Also,, solar spacecraft must contain and maintain a strong magnetic field, greater than 4,000 gauss, as this is inherent to their environment. The (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"UFOS, Continued effects of this variable should also be obvious to anyone with the slightest interest in the subject of UFOs. We cannot develop a set of differential equations with all the variables involved in the phenomenon and hope to obtain exact numeric answers to each variable. The scientific studies of the past should have attempted to get first approximation solutions to the variables, one at a time. SYNTHESIS There was another fault in the scientific techniques used before. The possible existence of nonterrestrial intelligences (and their purported visits to Earth), is a highly interdisciplinary matter requiring not only input from diverse scientific and technical subjects and concepts, but more importantly, synthesis and integration. The space age brought about interdisciplinary problems which required new techniques to solve. Early in this era, brainstorming sessions proved to be valuable. In these informal sessions, scientists and engineers exchanged ideas in an uninhibited manner in the hope of solving seemingly impossible problems or discovering something of value to ongoing programs. The layman would have been amused to listen to the ideas echanged here. This was the place and the time to openly suggest ideas that in normal circumstances would be considered ludicrous, bizarre, and even ridiculous. But, the process worked. These meetings allowed the integration of ideas that came from individuals who excelled in different subjects, and who held different opinions on the same subject. When ten individuals met in a brainstorming session, the result was a synthesis of ten minds, as if the product of one mind, In formal sessions, ten separate ideas in the form of papers or speeches are presented and the outcome can hardly be described as a synthesis of a situation. I must admit that the physicist in me abhors the solar life hypothesis, the biochenist in me cannot see the possibility, the aerospace engineer can disprove the idea, and so on. But, just as in the case of a large jigsaw puzzle, a sufficient number of the pieces must be properly placed before the outline of the final portrait becomes perceptible. The UFO scientific debates, studies, and discussions, as witnessed from the available publications, can hardly be described as brainstorming sessions. Rather, these seem to be \"case by case\" efforts by divided individuals. The UFO phenomenon was always considered to be highly interdisciplinary in nature; so why not true interdisciplinary effort? Not exchange of ideas by qualified experts from different fields, but syntheis of their knowledge. These are samples of what went wrong with the scientific attempts to solve the intelligent aspect of UFO phenomena. Of course, some nonscientific matters played a role. The preoccupation with the cover-up aspect, the media, study of the witnesses, and similar matters have diverted energies away from the ultimate goal: a genuine scientific solution to the problem. In addition, there were other matters, philosophical in nature, to deal with. If they (the nonterrestrials) exist and are visiting out planet, why don't they establish open communications with us? This assumes that our level of intelligence is on par with theirs. We do not, for example, make a sincere effort to communicate with creatures of much lesser intelligence than ourselves when we study these in laboratories or in their natural habitat. This is a harsh statement for humanity. But, what would a nonterrestrial make of us, a belligerent minority, as deduced from reported attempts to shoot them down, and a confused majority, showing fear and resorting to prayer and worhsip when the objects come near? In 1917, a peculiar sighting was called a miracle, the miracle of Fatima. Here, we are told that thousands of people witnessed a Sun-like object descend through the clouds. The sighting, it was reported, led to prayer and worhsip by most of the witnesses. We can say that that occurred before the aviation age and the space age, and that we are more sophisticated today. This is not the case. There were sightings in the 1960's, 70's, and even 1980's where the objects were associated with the Second Coming of Christ, e.g., Cuernavaca, Mexico in September 1965; or that the objects are the product of the Deity. In December 1980, a UFO witness in Texas, seeing a huge, very bright, and fiery object, comforts her young companion by pointing out that if a man appears from the object, it will be Jesus. This is a natural human reaction. Think of the feelings of awe generated by the appearance of a comet, before the nature of comets was explained. And so will it be with the mysterious \"glowing; self-luminous, and fire-like\" objects until their nature is explained. WHY SOLAR LIFE? Some readers may wonder how or why did the idea of solar life come about. The hypothesis is the product of a personal odyessy through the fields of knowledge. An odyssey which has taken a lifetime. In its infant stages, the idea seemed plausible, but it required extensive research to solve many scientific and technical problems that were very apparent. But even after many pieces of the puzzle fell into place there was still a major hurdle to conquer, the requirement of the modern scientific method: observ- ations and tests. Mythological, theological, and historical records would not do. TheVelikovsky affair was a good lesson. More importantly, my professional experience .in the aerospace industry would not allow the use of ancient data. Modern observations, human or instrumental, or tests were needed. And so, I set the idea aside. During the period of October 1978 to May 1979, and while on business trips in Europe and the Middle East, I made several 2-3 day visits to Kuwait. On one occasion, there was commotion in the city. Prior to my arrival it was reported that a huge, fiery object appeared over the city, resulting in a power blackout and the interruption of international communications satellite carriers as it hovered curiously over some facilities (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"UFOS, Continued for nearly twenty minutes. The phenomenon was the subject of much conversation in the city. Kuwait, a modern city, is powered by state-of-the-art facilities. In the candlelight, I remember discussing the phenomenon and other mysterious occurrences with business associates. Some spoke of miracles and how the phenomenon can be explained as the work of God. If it were not a miracle, they said, then how come the twentieth century scientists have not been able to solve it. Scientifically ingrained, my mind could not accept the proposed miracle as a solution. They suggested that I speak with some government officials whom I knew to see if I could be of assistance in the matter. 1 thought to myself, \"executives in aerospace industry do not muddle their names with the UFOs,\" and so I left without any follow-up. POWER FAILURE Later, on the same trip, there was a partial power blackout in Cairo. The utilities were old, and there was no mention of UFOs. I began to think that people do not shout \"UFOs\" every time the power goes out. I remember the great East Coast blackout of the 1960's, and other power failures on other continents and how these were associated with the simultaneous appearance of mysterious \"fire-like\" objects. I was impressed with the sincerity of the people in Kuwait. They had nothing to gain from me if I accepted the reality of their experience of a fiery and intelligently-controlled object. If a genuine scientific solution to the intelligent aspect of the UFO phenomenon was not possible, then the indictment of science and the scientists by my audience was valid. Immediately thereafter, I wondered what if the modern UFO sightings contain the perception, modern observations, to my conception, the Solar Life hypothesis? The idea of solar life is bizarre, nonsensical, and even outrageous but such is the nature of new discoveries. Intensive study of the UFO subject showed that the probability was indeed 10 high that the mysterious \"glowing, self- luminous, and fire-like\" objects were the possible product of Solo sapiens. This provided the incentive to study outstanding technical and scientific problems in the physics, biochemistry, biology, and thermo- dynamics of solar life. Copernicus did not place the Sun in the center of the solar system; rather, he showed how observed phenomena can better be explained with the heliocentric model. I do not place life on the Sun; I merely show how observed phenomena can better be explained with the solar life hypothesis. This article hardly scratches the surface of the subjects involved. But, I hope it has achieved the stated object of showing What Went Wrong with the scientific attempts to solve the UFO phenomenon. And now that a normal trend to the observed phenomenon is developed and an equivalent mental picture is drawn, we can turn our attention to the \"case by case\" evaluation. This will be the subject of my next article. We will identify hundreds of cases which specifically support the idea of solar life, and clearly point to the Sun as the home of the enigmatic objects and their builders. We will see how time after time, our common sense played havoc with our minds. Some complained that a superior nonterrestrial intelligence capable of visiting our planet should be intelligent enough to communicate to us \"where\" they come from. Communication is a two-way affair, however, so that not only is their intelligence involved, but also ours. Look at this exchange from the Andreasson Affair: Q: Are they referring to our sun as we know it? A: Yes, our sun. Sunbursts. Q: Is the sun a key to the truth? A: Yes Q. Does time exist and the next question, Can they travel inside the earth? Detectives, like scientists, set out a logical trail and follow it where-ever it may lead in search of the truth. After the second question, the built-in bias in our collective common sense leads to an impasse: solar life, impossible. And so the subject is simply changed. I do not place great emphasis on a single case, so this exchange is not to be construed as a clincher. Yet, I was amazed to find that the UFO literature is replete with specific indications and clear signs which point to the Sun. The problem, as we will see, is not in their intelligence or our intelligence; it is in our common sense. CONCLUSION The serious scientific attempts to solve the intelligent content of some of the UFOs have not produced a genuine scientific solution. This led to the conclusion that either the \"intelligent\" content does not exist, or that something went wrong with the scientific attempts. Beginning with the premise that some of the UFOs may be the product of nonterrestrial intelligences, we indentified some faults with previous scientific efforts. The most disturbing of these was the prevailing belief that a genuine scientific solution could be achieved through the identification of that one case, the clincher. And that, as I said above, was the pitfall. The essence of the business of science is to find trends in observed phenomena and to form general- izations from these. A representative data set for the most common \"description\" of the UFOs was shown to contain a normal trend, a point of gravitation. \"Glowing, self-luminous, and fire-like\" was the region of gravitation of the data set. The Solar Life hypothesis, when extended beyond simple molecular structures, led to the fantastic possibility that the proposed solar life could have evolved to an intelligent and technologically advanced level. Objects which are constructed by the proposed solar beings and even the solar beings themselves will, due to their nature and our method of observation within the visible spectrum, appear to the human witnesses to be \"glowing, self-luminous, and fire-like.\" It was then proposed that the \"intelligent\" UFOs represented the observations which corroborated the (continued on page 15) it.\""},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"COSMIC LIFE LINE PRINCIPLE 1E+4 A z H W X V J1E+3: a H fl K fc - SEA LEVEL CONUECIION ZONE ON THE SUN - REAL , ......

This is his first article for the Journal. The fortieth anniversary of the \"dawn\" of present day ufology, the 1947 benchmark Arnold sighting of several flying discs in Washington state, is rapidly approaching.' This milestone is an appropriate point to assess the progress of our understanding of the phenomenon and suitable approaches reasonably necessary to advance the future study of these perplexing objects. Approximately two generations have reached maturity since Arnold, and concerned individuals and organizations continue to busily analyze available data. Copious sightings have been reported from around the world by reputable and highly qualified percipients. However, despite the volume of narrative testimony and documentary evidence collected in the Post-Arnold years, no \"smoking gun\" has been disclosed. Ufology remains, in the minds of most persons, a pseudo-science. Serious researchers are left at ,,the most rudimentary phase of research, namely, establishing that there is more to the subject than weather balloons, swamp gas or sightings of the planet Venus, and that these voluminous reports are indeed worthy of further serious analysis. Whether as a result of official censorship and misinformation, or merely due to the, unusual and remarkable nature of the reported phenomena, it remains difficult to convince the uninformed that the study of these objects is worthy of consideration and respect, rather than ridicule. In the classic tale, Robinson Crusoe finds a human footprint while walking on the beach of a deserted island. This evidence compels him to conclude that he is not alone after all. This is circumstantial evidence, just as valid as direct evidence, meaning a conclusion that must be inferred from the evidence with which one is presented. Circumstantial evidence is the type of almost exclusive verification ufologists have, at their disposal today — credible but. inconclusive. FOIA Perhaps the most important tool for ufologists to be developed in the post-Arnold years is the Freedom of Information Act (5 USCS s 552), which requires federal agencies to make their records available to the public, but provides several exemptions to this mandatory disclosure, including national security. In 1974 Congress amended the FOIA to provide that the government need not disclose the requested documents even to the reviewing court for inspection to determine whether disclosure , is proper, but rather, the courts are now required to \"accord substantial weight\" to an agency's affidavit concerning the classification of the documents sought. In short, the,court itself may never see the data sought so as to determine whether it may be safely declassified. Obviously, the efforts of responsible ufologists must be tempered by the legitimate dictates of national security. Those charged with the preservation of our safety and integrity as a nation must not be compelled to disclose technical data potentially useful to our adversaries or highly charged information likely to provoke mass hysteria. But neither must the exemptions to the FOIA be improperly relied upon to avoid the just and proper application of its disclosure requirements. The FOIA is useful only to a point. We have learned through the efforts of such groups as CAUS that a) the government maintains a vast and expanding amount of UFO information, b) this information is considered so sensitive that it is not disseminated within government security circles, except on a \"need to know\" basis, and c) continued utilization of FOIA, even iri its present form, is vital to UFO research, but not likely to disclose much information different in character from that already obtained without further amendment of the statute. We may conclude the UFO material is so closely guarded by the bureaucracy charged with its safekeeping that even our highest elected officials are not privy to much of it unless necessary. We are reminded of the .1979 request by President Carter, rejected by NASA, to reopen UFO research and the well-known letter of Senator (and retired USAF General) Barry Goldwater, bemoaning the refusal of the Air Force to permit him access to secure areas of Wright- Patterson Air Force Base alleged to house UFO artifacts. We must understand that governmental bureaucracies are not designed to be responsive to the .will of the people, but rather to perform certain set functions in accordance with the rules and regulations governing their actions. OPPOSITION Waves of sightings have come and gone over the years, paralelled by waves of public interest, disinterest and even ridicule. Recently, sightings have gone unreported by the mass media, reported only if explainable, or treated as a joke. Reporting may reach only local media sources and not be covered nationally, despite the alarming nature of some. This is a matter of concern, for without an adequately informed and concerned public, serious study of (continued on page 19) 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"HUMANOID ENCOUNTER By Ron Westrum Ron Westrum, a Professor of Sociology at Eastern Michigan University, Ypsilanti, is MUFON Consultant in his area of expertise and a previous speaker at the 1976 and 1981 Symposia. ABSTRACT Two boys, Eric Northridge and Hal Kelly*, both 11, saw a UFO go overhead, then were chased by a humanoid figure in the woods behind their home. Various emotional disturbances followed the sighting, as well as eye problems. NARRATIVE The two boys were sledding and playing in the woods behind their homes on a snowy evening (December 1981) about 8-9 p.m. What they thought was an airplane went overhead, with green lights on the top and red lights on the bottom. Hal said the object was dark, that it spun around without noise, and moved very slowly. Eric said there was something spinning very fast underneath it. They thought the object came down near the woods or Loch Erin, about a mile or two away. The boys drew a picture of a disk-shaped object with lights around the rim. The boys kept on playing and sledding (for two more hours?). The next part of the sighting is indistinct. Hal, who was higher up on the hill than Eric, said he then saw three .shapes come out of a green cloud, later described as \"green smog\"; two were green and one was gray, the last with \"a shape that he had never seen before,\" with something like an elephant-trunk or the hose from a gas mask. Hal drew a picture of an upright phallus-like object. Eric said the object was very large. Hal at the time said that it came up to the fourth rung (?) from the top of the *Names disguised 14 telephone pole. Hal's memory of this part of the experience is faint, or so it appears. BLACK FIGURE By this point it had become dark. Eric had taken a flashlight from the house. The boys then saw something in the woods in a nearby gulley. Hal's impression was that it was a small negro man, and he yelled \"hey, you dumb nigger!\" . Then, to the shock of the boys, the thing rose over the top of the weeds. Eric, who .was about ten feet away from the creature, was paralyzed as if hypnotized, while Hal ran away. Eric was shaking all over, but soon followed, running to catch up with Hal. The creature then went zooming away, but came rapidly back, and began to come after the boys. It was about four feet high, had an indistinct body, and a small head, the size of a large grapefruit. Hal described it as having relatively short arms. On its spherical head was a small diamond-shaped opening in about the place a mouth would be. The mouth opened sideways, rather like a camera iris. The opening was \"ruby red.\" When this area opened, a groaning sound came back from the creature (Eric). The boys ran away from the object, but stopped in mid-field to look back. The creature was still there. The boys continued running back toward the house, went inside, and watched it from the enclosed back porch. The creature came up to the back gate. At this point, it was spinning around, according to Eric. (The creature could \"jump without landing and spin like a top\"). Surprisingly they did not alert Eric's mother to what they experienced while she could still look at it. The creature zoomed back into the woods. NIGHTMARES Both boys told their experiences to the Northridges.' Mrs. Northridge was skeptical, but spent two hours listening to their accounts. She put them in separate rooms and had them make drawings of what they had seen. They were very frightened; Eric described Hal as being \"white.\" Eric said that both of them were shaking. Hal insisted on sleeping at the Northridge house that night; \"whenever there was a noise, he would jump up\" (Eric). Both had bad dreams, Eric every night for many weeks, Hal at least for the week following the sighting. Eric had dreams about an invasion of aliens from outer space which couldn't be stopped by bullets: \"It's like I'm in the army, and these aliens come down and our bullets can't penetrate them, and they eat up our whole world.\" He now preferred to sleep in a sleeping bag, with his BB gun,nearby. He set up booby traps in his room, in case something came to get him. Hal was also afraid that the aliens were going to come and get him. The boys were often unwilling to go to the park behind the house. In a letter to me dated Feb. 16, (six weeks later), Mrs. Northridge noted that both boys \"will not go to the woods now and at dusk every night are extremely uneasy.\" Eric's grades suffered after the sighting. Eric also experienced problems with his eyes. If he tried to look out the side of his visual field, his vision would blur. As far as he could tell, the problems began with the sighting. The event left very strong traces oh the emotions and memories of the boys, but memories are malleable. Hal's father was very skeptical (\"I gave Hal a pretty hard time\"), and intimidated him in regard to the sighting. Hal accordingly is very reluctant to volunteer information about the sighting.

The hypothesis is also finding corroboration in the recent discovery, and study results, of complex living organisms near under- sea volcanic vents. There have been several seemingly valid scientific objects to the proposed possibility of solar life. But, none of these seems to have served the fantastic possibility the \"desired\" coup de grace. I say \"desired,\" for intelligence that is vastly superior to our own and only some eight light-minutes away from Earth is indeed a serious matter. This will have profound impact on humanity. The impact need not be adverse, though it may. Universal truths are indifferent to the way we think, feel or believe. If there is life on the Sun, then there is life on the Sun, and there is nothing we can do about it, but try to comprehend this reality in the scheme of things. If we can open channels of communications with them, then we would like to know if they are people united on a vast globe, or peoples divided, each within boundaries. If there is any semblance of truth to some of the mythological accounts, of solar beings striking each other with bolts of lightning and fire in our atmosphere, then they appear to be as divided and quarrelsome as we are. Nonetheless, if they exist, some of us may want to know if they found answers to some age-old questions: What was the beginning? What is the end? Is there life after death? Others may ask more pragmatic and less esoteric questibns:/How can we double or triple the fertility of the land, fix injured economies, employ the unemployed, feed the hungry, and shelter the refugee and homeless? Still, other may want to know how to turn heaps of dirt into blocks of gold. And, if Solo sapiens exist, then some would want to know if they feel joy or pain, if they have passions or emotions, if they love or hate. The questions are many and intriguing. The answers, if there are any, are more so. If (and what another big IF) they exist, then the most promising outcome will be that of meaningful and sincere talks among the nations of the Earth — not to discuss nuclear winter and disarmament, but to try to achieve the long-sought-for-dream of humanity PEACE. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The Solar Life hypothesis is the product of careful and lengthy study of thousands of books and tens of thousands of articles. It is difficult, if not impossible, to identify and acknowledge the contributions of all individuals to the assembly of the large puzzle. If the hypothesis is on the right track, then I attribute the success to the collective effort of humanity. I had not cut nor shaped the pieces of the puzzle which came from diverse scientific and nonscientific subjects and concepts. I merely had the patience to go through the trial and error attempts to see the outline of the fantastic portrait, solar life. ABDUCTION, Continued It had been a remarkable session, yet even more details emerged during the debriefing. The man who picked Meg up \"didn't bend too well.\" He carried her to the UFO, which was high enough above the ground for him to walk under it to an \"elevator\" which lifted them into the ship. Meg described how they \"scraped\" her wrist, placing the pieces of skin into small, round containers. She lay on her back during this operation, feeling numb, yet when a long needle was pressed into her navel there was a great deal of pain. \"I'd like to get my hands on them.\" Meg announced with quiet anger. She also recalled their having \"done something to my temple,\" a procedure which, like the wrist \"scraping,\" apparently caused the scars still visible on her body. She had no memory of being returned to her bedroom. One of the most interesting aspects of the hypnosis was how resolutely Meg stayed with her account; how \"un-leadable\" she was as a witness. I always try to lead a subject away from what I believe happened, just to test how easily he or she can be \"led.\" When Meg said that she was very cold, I assumed that she was describing conditions inside the UFO, which-she had not yet said she had entered. As a test, I asked a question heading in what I suspected was a false direction: \"It's cold in the back yard?\" \"No,\" she said. / \"Inside.\" She knew what she meant, • despite my attempt to lead her away. A ... careful reading of the transcript will ' provide other examples of Meg's unswerving directness, a quality found in the hypnotic recall of every abductee I have worked with and tried, as a test, to lead. I suspect that the severe nosebleed Meg suffered during the night (without awakening!) might have been a result of the kind of nasal implant recalled in other UFO abduction cases. This early childhood experience, the evidence suggests, was just the first of an ongoing series of abductions that she has undergone, experiences that I hope to explore at another time. It remains an extremely dramatic event, however, precisely described with all } the language and emotion appropriate to an intelligent and frightened little girl trying to deal with an unimaginable new experience. © 1986 Budd Hopkins CAROLINA, Continued After the UFO finally left the Hidden Valley Horse Arena location, power and telephone reception returned to normal and the livestock and humans finally calmed down. The UFO report was published in many area newspapers in Hickory, Newton and elsewhere. A Morganton TV crew interviewed the eyewitnesses and myself, which was broadcast in the Morganton area.

Dobbs, K8NQN BETTY HILL Omni's \"UFO Update\" (October 1985) on Betty Hill prompted me. to write that magazine in order to clarify, the abductee's behavior based upon my firsthand knowledge of the witness. However, since my short article was rejected, I have decided to rewrite the piece for readers of the Journal. BLOW WHISTLE t . After careful deliberation, I feel it is time to blow the, whistle oh Betty's much publicized current claims. Since I was the initial investigator of the original . 1961 UFO encounter, and have personally visited Betty's \"secret landing site,\" I am perhaps in the best position of anyone to comment upon Mrs. Hill's'pronouncements. . . ' . But first it is important to differentiate between the '61 experience, and subsequent events. I knew both Barney and Betty before their abduction episode became known ,to the general public. The New Hampshire couple genuinely spurned all publicity about the dramatic incident until word of it finally leaked to the press in 1965. Two and a half decades later I am still convinced,of the reality of the original Hill experience. Persons involved in UFO close /('• encounters often suffer a variety of traumatic aftereffects, ranging from physical injuries to permanent life changes. Obsessional behavior is not uncommon among such witnesses (and perhaps'understandably,so). Betty is a classic example. SPOTLIGHT Consider what has happened to her. John Fuller's book (and later the television movie based upon the book) bestowed an incredible amount of attention and notoriety upon the quiet couple from Portsmouth, making them international celebrities. Then Betty lost the one person who had shared her UFO encounter; Barney's untimely death in 1969 had to have affected her deeply. The surviving witness continued to hope that her UFO captors would someday return. It is likely that her weekly vigils in the New Hampshire countryside serve as an outlet for her obsessions. One spring evening in 1978 Betty took me to her \"secret landing site.\" (It was our first reunion in years.) I hasten to say that every single object pointed out as a UFO was in fact identifiable — either as. aircraft lights ,6r distant ground lights. (I had brought along a telescope and binoculars just to be sure.) She steadfastly refused to accept — or at least admit — that her favorite UFOs were> merely airplanes;'' house lights, or pole lamps! '•., , .. I think in many instances Betty has fooled herself into believing she is seeing real UFOs. However, in other instances she appears to be consciously distorting the truth (like the UFO beams that allegedly blistered her car and burned out her camera!). Though I cannot prove that Betty Hill hasn't spotted one or two anomalous objects during her many vigils, I would have to say that such claims are extremely suspect based upon my own visit to her site. Unfortunately Betty's current ludicrous claims , only serve to undermine her credibility with respect to the original encounter. Critics who delight iii \"shooting down\" her recent pronouncements fail to consider the postencounter changes 24 years have wrought in the witness.

He described the creature as being 20-inches high and having a green color, both traits to be found in a UFO book he toted around while being interviewed. (His mother is certain this book came after the sighting, not before.) What was the creature? Fraud is unlikely in this case, since the intensity of the fear shown would be very difficult to fake, as would the subsequent avoidance of the woods and park areas. Animals seem unlikely. The boys were familiar with many different kinds of mammals and birds, including a Great Blue Heron that Eric had hauled in on a previous occasion. No natural phenomenon suggests itself. Thus, we have an object of an exceedingly strange shape, capable of rapid and seemingly intelligent motion, in conjunction with a UFO sighting and another very odd appearance (the things in the \"green smog\"). Something scared the boys. If it was not an alien, what was it?

Glynn Lunney returned for the. event as did Tony Verrengia and others. POLITICIANS The politicians in the audience included the Astronaut/Senators, Ted Kennedy and Caroline, Gov. Mark s . White of Texas, and President Ronald Reagan and Nancy. < The program began with music by the Lackland AFB base with very appropriate memorial service music. Dr. Graham, acting head of NASA, spoke of the occasion and the sacrifices. He was followed by a religious reading from the Book of Psalms by Rev. Hawley.' ; ' President Reagan was exceptional. He spoke personally of each of the seven Challenger crew. He mentioned their dreams and their special talents. When he remembered Ron McNair's dream to play his saxaphone in a space station, he said \"There will be a space station.\" He recognized the battles fought and the medals won by Mike Smith and Dick Scobee. He told about their love for challenge and for space. He said \"Their Shuttle program will continue. Their dreams will live.\" He .called the seven by their first names and recognized their .sacrifice and the burden carried by their loved ones — family and colleagues. The service concluded by all singing \"America, The Beautiful.\" Then 4 astronauts in their T-38 jets roared into the area. One broke out of the formation and disappeared into the clouds. The other three flew by in the \"missing flyer formation.\" A saddened, somber, but very proud group of people left NASA after waiting for the families of the missing seven to be escorted away. Patriotism was reinstilled in the group and a strong resolve to get the problems fixed and the space business in gear again was born. I have no doubt we can do it, and even better than before. 18 THE NIGHT SKY ; By Walter N. Webb MUFON Astronomy Consultant MARCH 1986 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): ; ' Venus remains very low in the west all month, setting about 7 PM in mid-March. On the llth a young crescent moon can be used to locate the bright planet only a few degrees below. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars and Saturn, in Ophiuchus, widen the gap between themselves, the former • moving eastward into Sagittarius late in the month. Mars is redder than Saturn and about the same brightness. Don't confuse the ruddy planet with the nearby red star Antares. On the 6th Saturn passes 6 l / 2 ° north of Antares, the first of three conjunctions.in.1986. The ringed planet begins retrograding westward on the 19th. It rises about midnight in midmonth, while its neighbor Mars does so about an hour later. Both planets are in .the south at dawn. Jupiter, in Aquarius, becomes visible in the morning sky late in March, rising an hour before the sun and staying very low in the ESE. Halley's Comet: Now outbound and again heading toward earth, Halley is brightening and best . ; seen near the start of twilight on moonless mornings from March 7-21 (roughly l l / 2 hrs. before sunrise at lat. 40°N and about 1 hr. 20 mins. before sunup at 30°N). During this period the ; tail may lengthen from perhaps 10° to 25°, slanting low.and to the right in the.SE sky. The farther south you are, the higher, the comet will be. Northern observers should find a clear, unobstructed SE horizon (maximum altitude of the comet's head at lat. 40°N is only 10° in late March). Moonlight will interfere again from the 22nd to the end of the month. During March Halley's path takes it across Capricornus, below the \"teapot\" of Sagittarius, and into Corona Australis. . During \"Comet Encounter Week/' March 6-13, five space probes from the Soviet Union, Japan, and Europe will fly by and through the Comet Halley. Giotta will hurtle within only 300 miles of the icy nucleus on the 13th. Moon Phases: Last quarter-Mar. 3 New moon--Mar. 10 First quarter-Mar. 18 Full moon-Mar. 25 € The Stars: O This month at 9 PM the sky is separated into the bright stars of winter exiting in, the west, while the patterns of spring arrive in the west-Leo, Coma Berenices, Bootes, and Virgo. In midevening look high in the south for a very dim patch of light SE of Castor and Pollux, the Twin Stars of Gemini. With binoculars or telescope, the patch is resolved into a cluster of stars called the Beehive or Praesepe in Cancer the Crab.

Moseley, the permanent chairman of the NUFOC will no doubt preside as the master of ceremonies. For futher details, please write to Hal Starr at 312 West Frier Drive, Phoenix, AZ 85021. The dates for the Rocky Mountain Conference on UFO Investigations, sponsored by PRO UFOS (Paranormal Research Organization for UFO Studies) at the School of Extended Studies at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, Wyo. 82071, were not available when this copy was prepared. Details will be announced later. * * * We want to publicly thank Joe Brill of Quincy, Illinois, MUFON's first International Coordinator, for donating a large segment of his UFO files to the Mutual UFO Network. Mr. Brill is probably best known for his specialization in the countries referred to as \"UFOs Behind the Iron Curtain.\" Back issues of Flying Saucer Review, SKYLOOK and the newspaper clipping services are appreciated. We hope to publish some of Joe's foreign investigations with photographs in future issues of the Journal. * * * Ray Boeche, State Director for Nebraska, will have a published paper updating his research into the Rendlesham Forest Incident, including interviews with other eyewitnesses, in the MUFON 1986 UFO Symposium Proceedings. The new title for Dr. Richard F. Haines' upcoming book will be \"The In-flight Disappearance of Frederick Valentich\" with the forward by Dr. Bruce S. Maccabee. His book will be privately published. Since Dr. Hynek has requested that he take a less active role in the DR. RICHARD F. HAINES operation of the Center for UFO Studes (CUFOS) during his recuperation from surgery, the following people have accepted new assignments: Sherman J. Larsen, Chief Executive Officer; Nancy Conrad, Treasurer; and Mark Rodeghier, Deputy Scientific Director. The International UFO Reporter (IUR) is headed by Jerome Clark, Editor; and Sherman J. Larsen, Production Manager. The new address for CUFOS and IUR is 1955 John's Drive, Glenview, Illinois 60025 and the office telephone number is (312) 724-2480. There may be additional reorganizational plans made at the Board of Directors meeting early in March 1986. The success of the monthly Massachusetts MUFON Newsletter published by Marge Christensen as a communication tool within the state has prompted other State Directors to inaugurate monthly newsletters. Francis L. Ridge, State Director for Indiana, has published several issues, while Dr. Gary Levine, State Director for New York is preparing his first edition. Other State Directors are encouraged to follow the leadership of their colleagues in this respect. 40 YEARS, Continued UFO phenomena may never progress beyond its present condition. The opposition is strong and firmly entrenched. Absent the remote possibilities of a surprise revelation by the government or those responsible for the phenomena observed, continued expansion of our knowledge in this area may be limited for another forty years. Direct confrontation with government bureaucracy under the FOIA as presently written may not be the most fruitful approach. Public opinion must be awakened, and in turn, our elected officials who created the bureaucracy and to whom it is ultimatey answerable, will be compelled to create a more responsive approach. The FOIA must be strengthened to protect the public interest in disclosure of these materials. The laudable efforts of such organizations as MUFON, • CUFOS and CAUS have done much to raise public awareness. Yet, there remains a vast \"silent majority\" who know next to nothing of the true UFO facts. Informing the public and creating grass- roots lobbying effort directed toward the creation of a responsible attitude on the part of our elected officials may be the most effective approach in learning the truth and lifting ufology above the past forty years of significant progress but also frustrated effort.

Second class mailing to all foreign countries is now $30.00 in U.S. funds, payable by International Postal Money Order or a check written against a U.S. bank. Cash in U.S. dollars is acceptable and sometimes more convenient. Since the study of the UFO phenomenon is frequently a family affair, additional members in the same family, that is idential addresses may become members for $10.00 each when one member in the family subscribes at the regular rate, provided they so designate when submitting their dues. Air mail postage to foreign countries is an additional fee. We are confident that members will feel that 12 monthly issues of the MUFON UFO JOURNAL (20 pages) for $25.00 is an exceptional value compared to other UFO publications available. It must be taken into consideration that the Journal is just one of the benefits that members receive for their annual dues. Members may also purchase the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual for $6.00 whereas it is $10.00 to everyone else. (Postage and handling is $1.50 extra for all.) * * * Tom Benson, State Director for New Jersey, has advised that Fred Schaefer of Clementon, N.J., recently appointed new State Section Director, has declined to accept this responsibility due to health problems. Ward Campbell, the State Section Director for Gloucester, Salem and Camden Counties since 1974, will continue in this capacity as well as the Assistant State Director for New Jersey. Steven E. Seifried, Ph.D. has been selected to be a Consultant in Biochemistry. Dr. Seifried resides in Milwaukee, Wis. and is the son of Richard D. Seifried, Ohio State Director. Miss Sandra Hambrecht of ROBERT H. BLETCHMAN New Egypt, N.Y. has volunteered her expertise as a translator for Russian. She has a masters degree in Russian and is also available to translate German and Spanish. William J. Chapleau, State Director for Vermont, has reinstated Marcel J. LaVictoire as State Section Director for Rutland County. * * * Bob Grattan, State Director for Virginia, has accepted the post of Head Librarian at the American Library in Paris, France on or about April 1, 1986. Mr. Gratan will be missed since he has also been active on the MUFON Amateur Radio Net each Saturday morning on 7237 KHz. We have reluctantly accepted the resignation of Bill Pitts as State Director for Arkansas. Business responsibilities have prevented him from providing the leadership in the state that he feels the position requires to be effective. Both gentlemen will continue to be members. * * * An award will be presented at the MUFON 1986 UFO Symposium to the person judged by a ballot of the members who has done the most for the UFO subject during this calendar year.
