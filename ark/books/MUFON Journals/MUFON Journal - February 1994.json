A year later, the Fund for UFO Research joined the effort. By agreeing to divide the costs with MUFON for a sophisticated computer system, FUFOR underscored the need for comparative analysis of all reported factors in the verbatim transcripts. With an ever growing number of cases on record and a powerful computer now in place to conduct multi- factor analyses, future updates will begin to address the question \"Who does what?\" This initial report is limited in scope, presenting data for each descriptive element without factoring by entity type or other variable. The findings are based on 317 transcripts derived from thirteen abduction researchers. (1) Most of the subjects were hypnotized and/or interviewed on multiple (or even numerous) occasions. Consequently, the 317 documents, each from a single session, comprise 95 separate cases: 27 males, 58 females, and 10 cases with both male and female subjects. It is not the author's in- tent to imply statistical significance for any of the results that follow. PREFACE Abduction cases involve widely varying descriptions of entities, surroundings, medical and other procedures, communications with the beings, and post-event ef- fects. However, similarities among many accounts are striking. This, the first of two parts, addresses typical abduc- tion sites; precognition of an episode and familiarity with a being; vehicle types; how subjects are trans- ported and the resulting effects; features of the examin- ing room; odors detected; recognition of other abductees; and the appearance of the entities, including their gar- ments and locomotion. In this report, a \"case\" includes all abduct ion-related events in a subject's life. Families or roommates are also considered a single case except wherein an indi- vidual had separate CE-4 episodes apart from the shared living arrangement. The data below frequently express the number of \"subjects\" to which an abduction factor applies. In such tallies, every subject represents a dis- creet case. For some factors, the total of all input exceeds 100% of the cases reported, since many individual subjects have encountered more than one type of entity or circum- stance. The terms \"entity,\" \"being\" and \"alien\" are used interchangeably, as are \"vehicle,\" \"ship\" and \"craft.\" ABDUCTION SITE In a great majority of the 95 cases, the subjects indicated that their own residence (generally the bedroom) was the abduction point. However, 15 subjects have also (or in- stead) reported some other location. Ten of those were taken from their automobiles and six from a cabin or campsite. UNSEEN PRESENCE Whether purposeful or inadvertent, over a fourth (28%) of the subjects in the study have sensed an alien presence other than visually. This often occurred in the hours, minutes or seconds before visual confirmation. In other cases, an unseen presence was felt in the midst of a cluster of episodes but with no known CE-4 on that night. The recognition was sometimes obvious — an elec- trical tingling, a buzzing or beeping in the person's mind, or rappings and other \"poltergeist\" activity. In a few cases, the subject \"just knew\" that the intruders were present. FAMILIARITY From prior events, presumably, many subjects recog- nized their abductors — or one in particular — a factor which David Jacobs has called the \"familiar being.\"(2) While common, the initial results of this study sug- gest it is far from a universal aspect. In the 95 cases thus far recorded, the subject told of recognizing one or more entities in 34. Relatedly, ten subjects teiepathically heard their own names spoken by a being. In 18 other cases, the entity told the subject (s)he was \"chosen,\" \"special\" or \"pro- tected\" in some unspecified manner. Taken together, these three factors (familiar beings, hearing one's name, and selection or protection) ac- count for 44 cases. Dan Wright is Manager of the MUFON Abduction Transcription Project.

FEBRUARY 1994 NUMBER 310 PAGE 3"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL VEHICLE SIGHTED A telling point concerning the study findings to date: Only a small majority (55%) of the sub- jects had ever sighted an anom- alous object (i.e., excluding simple nocturnal lights) — whether dur- ing an abduction scenario or any other time. Table 1 shows the basic vehicle shapes reported among the 31 cases in which an object of any specific shape was discerned. SUBJECT TRANSIT No doubt surprising to some read- ers, a clear majority of the study's subjects had no recollection of ever going to or returning from a ship. This poses obvious questions for ensuing research. Of those who did recall the transit, four mentioned a small, peculiar capsule in which they were placed. Levitation, though, was by far the more frequent mode, cited in 33 cases. In 17 cases, usually beginning outdoors, the subject was raised bodily into the air by a beam of light. In 20 cases, the person was lifted out of bed and through a Table 1 Vehicle Shape Discoid (47%) Spherical (17%) Cylindrical (13%) Rectangular (6%) Triangular (6%) Oblong (6%) Asymetrical (2%) Conical (2%) 5 10 15 Number of Subjects Reporting the shape (from 31 cases out of 95) closed window (or screen), door, wall or ceiling — generally without sensing a surrounding light.

This feature, which played a part in 35 cases, was sometimes quite lengthy and usually curved. Soon, however, most subjects entered an exam- ining room that was fairly stark in appearance, likened to the office of a doctor or dentist. The room's shape has been described in 29 cases. In 25 of those, it was said to be either round(ed) or domed. This, together with curving hallways, coincides with the preponderance of discoid vehicles in the study. Notably, nine subjects remarked on an especially large room with either numerous examining tables or am- phitheater-type seating. Coloration of the room was mentioned in 31 cases. White was dominant in 18, while grey (or metallic) was the theme in eleven. Curiously, in three a room with black walls was mentioned. Thirty-two subjects remarked on the relative lumi- nosity onboard. A very bright room was found in 25 cases, but in 13 there was a dim or dark room. Obviously, then, a few subjects encountered both. Room furnishings included variations on many built- ins and items of furniture in our daily lives. The center- piece was nearly always a table (or tables), specifically mentioned in 52 cases and implied in most of the re- mainder. Typically it was hard, flat, rather narrow, and supported by a single pedestal. In a few instances, the table was raised, lowered or folded like a livingroom re- cliner. Other furnishings frequently seen were kitchen- type counters and/or cabinets, as well as computer pan- els and screens. Table 2 details these and other items. ODORS In 18 cases, the subject detected some specific aroma other than a basically clean smell. Nothing in particular dominates the data, but a couple bear mention. Four subjects apparently smelled the burning of their own hair or tissue, while six remarked on a foul odor emanating from the beings themselves. OTHER SUBJECTS Abduction events are thought by many to be solitary' experiences for the human subject. Yet, in 30 cases (nearly a third of the total) one or more other persons were seen in the vehicle and assumed — from their state of dress or demeanor — to be fellow abductees. Usually there was no communication whatsoever among the subjects. Ambiguous but fascinating, a few thought they recognized a certain person from previ- ous episodes. ENTITY SKIN TONE &. QUALITY \"Greys\" have gained status as the garden-variety alien in abduction lore. And while 38 subjects in the study have encountered grey (or grey-white) skinned entities, an- other 19 describe the abductors as absolutely \"white\" (not to be confused with Caucasian). In one case, the subject was emphatic by stating \"Clorox white.\" FEBRUARY 1994 NUMBER 310 PAGES"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Table 4 Entity Garment Type Robe/Cloak/Cape (37%) Jumpsuit/Coverall (23%) None (seems naked) (22%) Wetsuit(18%) 5 10 15 Number of Subjects Reporting the garment (from 44 cases out of 95) Neither greyish nor whitish aliens dominate the study's files, though. Dark-skinned entities were seen in 18 cases; blue or grey-blue in eight; and green or grey- green in seven. Beings with an aura (or \"glow\") ob- scuring the actual exterior were present in 13 cases. And five subjects reported a \"shadow-like\" entity that might not even be tangible. Table 3 is a breakdown of entity skin tones. Certain qualities associated with an entity's skin have been reported in significant numbers. In six cases, the epidermis was said to be \"translucent\" or \"thin\" and the underlying dermis (sometimes described as a grey gel) thereby visible. This might account for some con- fusion here and there as to whether a given entity was \"white\" or \"grey\" toned. In 17 cases, the subject reported a \"smooth,\" \"plas- tic,\" \"vinyl\" or \"shiny\" skin. This was usually attributed to the diminutive \"worker bee\" types rather than to the taller one(s) in charge. Fifteen subjects mentioned seeing one or more enti- ties who were prominently wrinkled. These were some- times referred to as \"old ones\" and thought to be im- portant figures. Thirteen persons mentioned that a being's touch (of- ten as part of examining procedures) was cool or cold, thereby prompting questions of whether such types are warm-blooded by our standards. ENTITY HEIGHT & BUILD Subjects in 66 cases remarked on the relative height of their captors. Few people are in fact good judges of same, and in many instances the estimate was from a prone position in bed or on a table of unknown elevation onboard. Nevertheless, in 57 of the 66 cases at least one entity type was depicted as \"short,\" typically between 3 and 4 1/2 feet. Also, in 47 cases there was mention of a \"taller\" entity — either taller than another type in the experience or of roughly adult human proportions. And in ten cases there was a \"tall one\" — at least 6 feet and more often over 7 feet. Forty-four subjects remarked on the entities' stature. In 39 cases, there was a \"skinny\" or \"frail\" being. Two subjects indicated someone of normal human build. And ten spoke of a being who was \"stocky,\" \"muscular,\" \"wide\" or \"stout\". FACIAL FEATURES Oversized eyes, typically almond- shaped and uniformly black, have cer- tainly been the norm in the literature. But that description is not exclusive. In 11 cases within this study, a distinct pupil, iris and/or sclera (whiteness sur- rounding the iris) was noticed. In three of those, the being was said to have \"cat's eyes\" (i.e, vertical-slit pupils). Basic eye color, among the 44 cases reporting, was described as: • black (or .dark) - 35 • green - 4 • blue - 3 • brown - 3 • gold-2 As to the nose, an indistinct rise above two small nostrils was indicated in 30 of the 33 cases reporting on same. One subject said it was pointed. Another five thought that a particular entity type was without a nose of any sort. Twenty of the 25 subjects who reported a being's mouth indicated either a line (or \"slit\") with no lips or said simply that the orifice was small. However, in three cases it was described as a \"hole\" (or the letter \"O\"), while two subjects believed there was no mouth at all. There was mention of the entities' ears, or absence thereof, in 25 cases. Eighteen said there was nothing vis- ible. Three noticed a cavity in the side of the being's head, and six others described some manner of ear lobe or protrusion. ENTITY GARMENTS Surprisingly, in 24 cases (55 percent of the 44 reporting on the presence of garments) the subject alluded to a \"robe,\" \"cloak\" or \"cape\" on at least one entity. These were nearly always worn by beings seen only onboard a vehicle and perceived as leaders. Ever popular, however, has been the (loose-fitting) \"jumpsuit\" or (form-fitting) \"wetsuit,\" one or the other seen in 23 cases. Disconcerting by our mores, in 14 cases certain enti- ties (always in lesser roles) were said to be naked. This PACE 6 NUMBER 310 FEBRUARY 1994"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Walking (51%) Levitation/gliding (41%) Shuffling (5%) Jerky (3%) might be a misperception in some in- stances, in that certain light-colored, tight-fitting suits are apparently almost the same color as the entity's skin. Basic black (or dark without a color specified) was the garb indicated in 21 cases. Conversely, 18 spoke of a white outfit. Silver (or \"shiny\") was identi- fied in six, while bluish silver (or bluish grey) and brown were each mentioned in another four. Insignias and accessories were not uncommon, but neither was any one type predominant. Nine subjects no- ticed some type of emblem on a jump- suit-type garment, usually identified only by its basic shape. A belt was seen in four cases and a sash in two. Also, two entities displayed a metallic pin at the neck of their robes, while one was adorned with a necklace. ENTITY MOTION Certain entity types seem to always walk — in the sub- ject's home, outdoors, and onboard the ship — whereas others are seen only in a \"gliding\" mode or other form of levitation. Many cases involve both walking and levi- tating — by the same or separate beings. In 31 cases a being walked. In 21 of those no other form of locomotion was ever apparent, but in the other ten the same or some other entity levitated at some point. In all, gliding or other levitation by an entity was present in a total of 25 cases. Three subjects described a being's shuffling motion, not specifying whether this was on or above the floor/ground. And two indicated a \"jerky\" motion. SUMMARY Any one transcript — stemming from hypnosis or a conscious-recall interview — is necessarily suspect: • Fantasies and frauds have haunted legitimate UFO research for more than 40 years. • A majority of the cases in this study did not involve carte blanche subjects. That is, they had read at least one or two best-selling books related to abductions. • Some persons are more readily and deeply hypnotized than others, and some hypnotists might be more adept at eliciting factual memo- ries than others. That said, and within the confines of 95 cases, the au- thor has been impressed by replications of certain details not previously published or even widely discussed.

During a com- mercial break in the program, the control room operator caljed my attention to a telephone call from a listener. After the brief greeting, the man on the line said he would rather talk to me \"off the air\"—not the usual call-in questions that these programs generate. He felt that I might be interested in a recent UFO sighting report so I gave him my private telephone number. He called back promptly and related a UFO case re- ported recently at the main airport of Asuncion, Paraguay—the Silvio Petirossi Airport. The caller was unable to provide details, but he gave me sufficient in- formation to open the investigation. I was motivated to initiate the investigation immediately since the time factor was of essence while records were still intact and witnesses' memories were fresh. INVESTIGATION INITIATED My first inquiries were through my contacts with the military who recommended going directly to the locale of the sighting, the Silvio Petirossi Airport. After being processed through identification and security control, where they asked me to leave my camera and I.D. card, I was ushered into the internal block of the airport office carrying a \"visitor card.\" After a short delay, I was taken to the Captain's office where I met Dario Davalos, who was the Air Transit Operation Manager during this shift. Captain Davalos was a thin gentleman about 35 years of age with an apparently receptive attitude as he listened attentively when I related to him the purpose of my visit. Curiously, he looked at the pages of the MU- FON UFO Journal that I had taken with me and where my name appeared as the Representative for Paraguay for the American organization. To my surprise, the Captain was very open and even interested in the sub- ject. So much so, that when I asked him directly about the possible UFO incident which might have happened at his airport, he answered affirmatively. He then asked his secretary to bring him the report where, according to him, the date would appear. This was the first step in determining who was in Traffic Control that night. And, indeed it contained two of the names we were seeking to open the investigation. One of the names was Cesar Escobar, the pilot of the Cessna Model 210, who had been accompanied by the UFO for a distance of 170 kilometers. It didn't taken very long to find out that this story had become the topic of conver- sation in the corridors of the Air Traffic Control Offices and other offices at the airport, as well as among nu- merous pilots. When I spoke to one of the gentlemen, trying to obtain Cesar Escobar's address, he warned me \"he doesn't want to speak about this subject.\" INTERVIEW WITH CESAR ESCOBAR When I arrived at the spare parts workshop that the witness owns, I found a very kind man who at first had apparent doubts about speaking to me. After recognizing that I was very serious in my quest, he invited me to talk in the back of his store where his small office was lo- cated. After satisfying himself that I was not a newspa- per reporter from the city, but just a student of the UFO phenomenon, he decided to tell me what had happened the night of June 8, 1991. Mr. Escobar related the following experience: \"It was approximately 1800 hours (6 p.m.) on June 8, 1991, when I took off in my Cessna Model 210 from a farm located a few kilometers from the town of Concepcion. I was flying two passengers, two \"gringos\" (referring to foreigners, who in this case were German) south to the airport in Asuncion. One of them was the farm owner who I had served as his pilot for a few years.\" While he was speaking Escobar wiped his forehead and moved his large hands nervously. He said, \"I am in the habit of monitoring the airport radio transmissions to hear the communications of other planes flying in the locale. I don't remember how long it had been since we had taken off, but while talking with my passengers, I began paying attention to radio communication between the Traffic Control Operator and a Lineas Aereas Paraguayas (LAP) airliner.\" \"At first, I thought the LAP airliner was enroute to Bolivia, but later found that it was flying to Miami, Florida. The pilot of LAP advised the tower that he had some convergent traffic (that means that another air- craft is traveling in a converging direction) and wanted to know what it was. In the beginning the voice com- munication was normal, but it increased in intensity because the Captain of the LAP flight was becoming nervous for some unknown reason. I could hear every- thing perfectly clear. I at first thought the converging traffic could be an airplane who had lost his route, but then I heard the operator asking the LAP pilot if he could still see the object. The LAP Captain answered, 'Yes, affirmative, I have it just in front of me.'\" The official report shows that the personnel in Traffic Control contacted Bolivian controllers to determine if they knew anything about the unknown traffic, however, their answer was negative. Meanwhile, the pattern on the radar scope screens at the airport clearly depicted the ob- ject that the crew of the LAP airliner had reported visu- ally. PAGES NUMBER 310 FEBRUARY 1994"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Let's allow Cesar Escobar to continue with his story of what he was listening to on his radio about the con- versation between the airport and the LAP airliner, with- out even suspecting that a few minutes later he would be able to see for himself the strange object which was causing all of the excitement. \"Look, what I remember perfectly is that at some specific moment the pilot told the tower that the object had moved violently towards the left and then it went up, because the guy was re- peating 'I have it at 10 now,' (indicating an imaginary watch face which means the object was above and to the left, according to terminology used by pilots). Then the object went down a short distance while the Captain of LAP wondered what the hell was that terribly strong light that was beginning to get closer to him.\" All of that was very strange to Escobar because the communication between the pilot and the tower about the light was taking too long. Escobar surmised that if it was indeed a converging aircraft, they should have passed each other a long time ago. \"The most shocking thing was when I heard the pilot say that the object flew straight toward his airliner and passed over it at an incredible speed.\" ESCOBAR HAS SIGHTING Just a few minutes later, while Escobar was still con- templating what he had heard, a strong, bluish white light to his right attracted his attention. Flabbergasted, he said \"It all happened so fast that I couldn't understand what was going on. I couldn't believe that the object be- side me was the same object that passed over the LAP airliner only minutes before.\" When Cesar Escobar got to this point in his description, I noted that he was rub- bing his arms and had lowered his eyes. He shyly con- fessed that whenever he recounts this event, he gets \"chicken skin\" (goose bumps or goose flesh). \"I began to be concerned when my two passengers asked me what that object was and why was it flying so close to us. I didn't know what to tell them. At that moment, I received a radio communication from Radar Control at the airport asking me if I had traffic on my right and I answered affirmatively. Then he asked me to describe it, but I didn't answer.\" The fact that Escobar received that call from the radar controller clearly indi- cates that the object was seen on the radar scopes getting close to the Cessna aircraft. In subsequent investigations, this was confirmed by Jose Chavez, who was one of the men in charge of the radar that night. CESSNA INSTRUMENTS REACT WILDLY The Cessna Model 210 aircraft with its pilot and two passengers was accompanied for 25 minutes by the UFO, giving Escobar adequate time to carefully ob- serve it. I asked him about its shape and the estimated distance from his aircraft. He answered, \"The intensity of the light was so great that it prevented me from seeing its shape very well. I had the sensation that it was oval- shaped, but I could not confirm that. I assumed it was a little less than 400 meters from my airplane. There were moments when I was really frightened and somewhat desperate when the object would get closer and closer. During close approaches, the Cessna instruments 'went crazy.' I was concentrating specifically on my ADF (Automatic Direction Finder). The indicator was moving around indiscriminately, without any sense of direction. I was concerned if this continued, because I would have a serious problem navigating to my destination. When the light moved a little farther away, everything re- turned to normal. It repeated this 'game' several times. \"It seemed to be under intelligent control, therefore I believe there was somebody out there who knew what he was doing to me. I've never been so afraid in all my life. I didn't believe these things existed.\" He ended the interview by saying that the object accompanied him until he began to descend towards the International Airport of Asuncion, Silvio Petirossi. INTERVIEW WITH AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER Cesar Escobar made his approach to the airport at 1922 hours (7:22 p.m.). The duty operator in the Control Tower who authorized Escobar to land was Mr. Anibal Gavigan. Gavigan is a recognized professional special- izing in air traffic control from Sao Paulo, Brazil, with more than ten years experience. (Editor's note: Control Tower Operators in Brazil are members of the Brazilian Air Force.) He is also a civilian pilot. In my interview with Mr. Gavigan he said, \"I re- member perfectly well that night; it was freezing and the sky was completely clear and open. I received a call from Radar Control who told me that '2PTGU' (identi- fication number of Escobar's Cessna) was preparing to land and was being accompanied by a strange object. I was asked if I could see it. I immediately saw the lumi- nous object flying next to Escobar's plane.\" Gavigan continued: \"After the 2PTGU landed, I or- dered my aid (another witness) to turn off all the lights on the field and to turn them on again to have a better and clearer reference of the position of the object. During the time that the lights were out, the object re- mained motionless over the field at a distance of 600 meters, which was confirmed by the reading of the radar. The radar operator, Chavez, asked me for a visual confirmation of the object and I answered him that I was seeing it clearly. I even told him that I was going up to the platform on top of the tower to see it better with binoculars. While lying on the floor, I watched the object for about 4 or 5 minutes, with and without binoculars. During this time the strong reddish light remained sta- tionary.\" I noted that Anibal Gavigan told his story confi- dently and was absolutely coherent as he tried to clarify all details. We went up the ladder to the roof of the tower where he showed me how he was positioned to observe the object. It was obvious that the object could FEBRUARY 1994 NUMBER310 PAGE 9"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL be seen clearly without binoculars, since it was at the front of the field nearest to the tower. While I was taking his photograph, he pointed out to me the place where the object was \"parked.\" Gavigan said: \"That strong reddish light was stationary, absolutely still until something spectacular happened. From the place where the object was hovering, a luminous ray shot to the western hori- zon. The ray lasted only a fraction of a second just as if you were drawing a line with a marker—a perfect yel- low line going as far as you could see to the west.\" I asked him if he had heard any noise. He said that he didn't hear any noise and then continued, \"It was really astounding. The speed of that object was incredible. I was shocked—I've never seen such a thing in my life. I immediately went down to the tower operations room and heard Chavez calling me desperately from the radar control, asking me if I had seen that and I answered, yes.\" The radar makes one revolution in five seconds. The range was set for 150 nautical miles (approximately 210 kilometers). According to Chavez, who had been watching his radar scope screen, the radar couldn't mea- sure its speed when it departed, since it disappeared completely from his screen during one revolution (360 degrees) on the 150 nautical mile range. The experienced traffic controller was embarrassed when he stated, \"He considered it unforgivable that it was right there in front of us for five minutes and we couldn't take a single picture of it\" (visually or on the radar scope). He vows to keep a camera in the control tower for future use. The investigator heartily confirmed his decision. INTERVIEW WITH COLONEL DAVID FARINA Regretfully, I had to wait over two months for LAP to grant me an interview with Colonel of Paraguayan Aeronautics, Angel David Farina, who had been the co-pilot on LAP flight 702 that experienced the UFO sighting on June 8, 1991. At the beginning of the in- vestigation, the representatives of LAP told me that the recorded reports of flight 702 had been destroyed ac- cording to company internal rules. By the time that I ob- tained an interview, the expiration date for retention of flight records had passed. However, after two months a Mr. Melob of LAP called me and offered to make an appointment for me to interview Mr. Farina and provided me the co-pilot's telephone number. The day I called, his wife told me that her husband was on a flight to Chile, but he would be home the next day at 4 p.m. On Wednesday, August 26, 1991, at 6:30 p.m., I was finally successful in haying the opportunity to interview another of the prime witnesses to this fantastic UFO sighting. Mr. Farina told me that the Captain of the airliner, Colonel Maciel, didn't see the object, since he wasn't in the cockpit at the moment of its appearance. The Captain made a hasty departure from the restroom when he was told of the unusual light being observed by the remain- der of the flight crew, including the flight engineer in the cockpit. Colonel Farina confirmed the flight altitude as reported in the records and said the observation had taken place around 30 minutes after they took off from the Asuncion Airport while flying over Filadelphia, a city in the Paraguayan Chaco. The co-pilot also confirmed having asked the air- port for some information about the unusual object that he observed in front of the airliner. After airways traffic control asked radio communication facilities in Bolivia (an adjoining country to the northwest) about possible or unknown traffic and receiving a negative reply, they didn't know what to tell Colonel Farina. He certainly confirmed that the object had a strong reddish light and had an ovoidal shape. He couldn't tell me the altitude of the object or light when it flew over flight 702, since it is very difficult to make such calculations when flying at night. But, he added, \"It was very, very close no doubt.\" In recollecting other factors, he said the outside tem- perature was 40 or 45 degrees below zero and insisted that he was very rested—a habit that for him is standard procedure before scheduled flights. The investigator obtained a copy of the official report of this case titled \"Gerencia De Operaciones\" from the Ministerio De Defensa Nacional in Asuncion, Paraguay, signed by Carlos Fireira C. This was the source for ob- taining the names of some of the witnesses. Mr. Ramirez is MUFON's Representative for Paraguay. Walt Ancirus edited his original report. Jorge Alfonso Ramirez PAGE 10 NUMBER 310 FEBRUARY 1994"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL ROBERT LAZAR AS A FICTIONAL CHARACTER You can read him as fact or fiction. Does it ultimately matter? Maybe, maybe not. By Glenn Campbell I have been living for over a year now in the tiny set- tlement of Rachel, Nevada, in the shadow of the unacknowledged Air Force base at \"Area 51\" and twenty miles down the pike from the mysterious Black Mailbox. This area is supposed to be the hottest UFO hot spot this side of Gulf Breeze, but I confess that I ain't seen nothin'. That's not to say there's nothing alien out there along Highway 375. You may have read in the August 1993 MUFON UFO Journal of an alien abduction reported in this vicinity—at Milepost 26 to be precise. I have also spoken to countless visitors just back from the desert who report nighttime lights in the sky they feel certain are alien craft. I do not dismiss all of these sightings; I just haven't seen or experienced any of these things myself. When I go out into the desert at night, I see a lot of spectacular aerial displays, but nothing yet I haven't eventually explained. I see meteors, flares, aircraft lights and many manifestations of the bombing runs and war games that take place almost nightly on the Nellis Air Force Range. Part of the problem may be that I have a \"bad atti- tude\"—wanting data not just anecdotes. Perhaps the aliens can sense my skeptical nature, equate me with Phil Klass and refuse to put on any kind of show for someone who isn't prepared to trust them totally. Many people who come here expecting to see UFOs do seem to see them, while those who don't expect them, like avi- ation enthusiasts looking for human-built Stealth and hy- personic aircraft, seem to miss the UFOs altogether— even when they are only one hill away from the saucer seekers. I do not expect to see alien craft here myself be- cause whatever UFOs are, they are certainly a subtle phenomenon. I would not expect to see them on a \"timetable basis,\" as some talk-show ufologists have loudly claimed, or to see them much at all near such a widely publicized location as the Black Mailbox. If the government or aliens weren't smart enough to take the obvious precaution of not performing as published, then I would not expect UFOs to have remained so elusive for all these years. THE STORIES Most of the current interest in Area 51 by UFO watchers stems from Bob Lazar's tale about working with alien craft at nearby Papoose Dry Lake in 1988 and 1989. There were nine flying saucers, he says, housed in cam- ouflaged hangers built into a hillside near the lake bed. Lazar says he saw no aliens, only what appeared to be alien craft that the government had somehow \"obtained.\" He won't speculate about the aliens and their motives, but he can describe the propulsion system of their craft in detail based on what he claims was hands-on experi- ence. His is the sort of story I could believe because it is subtle, detailed and restrained, involves only a very limited government conspiracy and does not digress into any kind of speculation. It's the sort of story that ap- peals to engineers, computer programmers and other techie types: heavy on plausible technical details and free of the emotional overtones that complicate many other UFO tales. Aliens don't visit Lazar at his bedside; they enter the story only by implication and through briefing documents Lazar says he read. The beings de- scribed are the kind of extraterrestrials I can get along with: low-key and reclusive, having physical, dissectable bodies and pursuing their own private agenda with little more than clinical interest in individual humans. Lazar has never recommended the Black Mailbox— a rancher's mailbox along State Route 375—as a place to look for alien craft, but he and his companions do claim to have seen them nearby in 1989. Whether this is still the best place to set up watch is a matter of debate even among believers, but since this valley is the closest a civilian can get to Papoose Lake, this is where the pil- grims come. While I consider the Lazar story a thought- ful one that is not easily dismissed, I am less comfortable with the countless stories of sightings, abductions and psychic experiences reported here by many visiting \"ufo-tourists\" after Lazar went public. Some of these stories could indeed be true, but in my view most of the publicized UFO claims for this area have a cartoon silli- ness to them. They assume either a vast, all-inclusive alien-government conspiracy or that the aliens and bu- reaucrats lack any brains at all. People come here expecting the flying saucers to conform to their own schedule and expectations. According to conventional wisdom, Wednesday nights are the time to see alien craft and at 4:50 am Thursday morning you are sure to see the oft-photographed \"Old Faithful.\" I see only the landing lights of a Boeing 737 then—a scheduled crew flight to Groom Lake—but, again, maybe that's because my bad attitude is influ- encing events. Some watchers report a flying saucer which turns into a 737 just before landing, which I guess is a reasonable compromise. I see the desert skies here as a kind of Rorschach ink blot test, presenting a nightly sequence of ambiguous events that each visitor impresses his own feelings upon. FEBRUARY 1994 NUMBER 310 PAGE 1 I"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Bright white orbs that I interpret as aircraft landing lights or distant car high beams others may see as puls- ing, jumping disks that couldn't possibly be earthly craft. To see the orbs come closer and eventually pass— as a car—just a few feet away does not diminish the alien aura for some people. Did you see it turn into a Chevy? One talk-show ufologist, in all seriousness, has taken film footage that I interpret as landing lights and blown up the blinding orb to enormous proportions so it occu- pies the whole screen. He displays for audiences the changing images frame by frame with a running dialog about what each form means. In one, we see a face, in the next, a continent, and in the third—my God, it's Mickey Mouse! Visitors coming here in search of flying saucers have a tendency to \"personalize\" whatever they experience here. Many flatter themselves by thinking that invisible aliens and government spies are monitoring their every move and that any unusual event in the sky or on the ground is a show put on especially for that viewer's benefit. If you thought you saw something out of the corner of your eye but when you turned to look it was gone, then the saucer pilots must have sensed your glance and shot away in the nick of time. The area is es- pecially fertile ground for conspiracy buffs, who see a pattern of sinister, high level intent in even the most in- nocuous happening. Every flat tire, passing security pa- trol or shooting star \"could not possibly be coincidence\" and is lovingly knitted into the Great Conspiracy. Some people come here believing they are in direct psychic or spiritual contact with the aliens—or indeed are aliens themselves. The extraterrestrials are either hailed as ambassadors of love or cursed as instruments of the Devil. Many people expect the aliens to solve their personal problems for them—to carry them away from their earthly mess, perhaps, or to finally reveal to them the meaning of life. Some come in search of reli- gious inspiration: The sight of \"Old Faithful\" fills them with hope and reassurance, and I see nothing wrong with that. I cannot disprove these claims, but they do not appear to have any basis in Lazar's story. Personally, I find it more plausible that the aliens and government are pursuing their own narrow agenda on their own sched- ule and don't really give a damn about the people below. The trouble with this flying saucer hot spot, and probably every other claimed UFO venue, is that the original story is soon overwhelmed with noise. Once the frenzy of fantastic claims starts, then it feeds on itself, and the original spark that set it off is almost forgotten. THE BIG QUESTION What everyone wants to know is, Is Lazar telling the truth? Did he work on alien craft at Papoose Lake, or is his story a well-crafted hoax? Whichever side you choose to defend, there is plenty of circumstantial evi- dence to support your case. Lazar is, by all accounts, an eccentric and cre- ative guy, and people like him who do not fit any social mold do tend to get themselves In embarrassing messes. On one side is the impressive coherence and integrity of the story itself. Anyone can lie or fantasize about working at a secret UFO facility, but to tell the story re- peatedly with so much internally consistent detail is no easy feat. Telling the truth is easy—you just recall what happened—while maintaining a lie of such complexity would seem to require infinite gigabytes and megahertz of internal processing capacity to avoid tripping yourself up. Lazar is alive and well and clearly uninterested in co- operating with UFO researchers, but on the rare occa- sions when he takes questions, he always seems to come up with the right answers. Whether you ask him about gravity propulsion systems or the environment in which he worked at \"Area S-4,\" the answer he gives now is consistent with everything else he ever said in the past and seems to make perfect, down-to-earth sense to any- one who thinks it over. His story is restrained, logically consistent and full of the rich and unexpected nuances that normally only reality can provide. O n the other side, Lazar's background and creden- tials, or pointed lack thereof, provide fertile ground for doubt. His claims of having earned degrees at MIT and Cal-Tech are dubious to say the least. Sure, a sinis- ter government agency could pull a former student's records from the Registrar's Office, but could they re- move every record from every on- and off-campus agency, knock off every professor the student took classes with or intimidate into silence every classmate he once knew? Get real. At a conference in May, Lazar willingly provided the names of two of his professors— one at MIT and one at Cal-Tech—with the same appar- ent sincerity as his description of anti-matter reactors. Didn't check out. Prof. Hohsfield or his ghost never haunted MIT, while Prof. Duxler was never at Cal- Tech, only at the junior college where Lazar did once take classes. Lazar's bankruptcy proceedings prior to his alleged employment and later criminal charges against him re- lating to an illegal brothel do not lend him instant cred- ibility, but to a disciplined observer they do not neces- sarily disprove his claims either. Lazar is, by all ac- counts, an eccentric and creative guy, and people like this who do not fit any social mold do tend to get them- selves in embarrassing messes. Questions about \"char- acter\" do not change the facts of what did or did not hap- pen at Area S-4 and do not provide a \"smoking gun\" to prove or disprove the saucer claims. No human wit- ness is morally perfect or immune to scandal, and an ar- gument could be made that the most idiosyncratic peo- PAGE12 NUMBER 310 FEBRUARY 1994"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL pie—and thus the most scandal-prone—are just the sort who would have the courage to challenge a threatening authority and make a story like this public. Also creating doubt is Lazar's long association with ufologist John Lear, who was telling colorful UFOs- at-the-Test-Site stories long before meeting Lazar. By most accounts, the two met each other by coincidence a few months before Lazar's alleged S-4 employment. Lazar reportedly thought Lear was Loony Tunes back then but changed his mind about at least some of Lear's claims when he encountered the craft himself. The prior meeting raises the suggestion that Lazar's own UFOs-at- the-Test-Site story was a hoax generated initially for Lear's benefit that evolved from there into a media event. On the other hand, life is full of \"unbelievable\" co- incidences that turn out to be more plausible on closer inspection. A disciplined observer cannot discount the possibility that their meeting was indeed by chance and that Lear played a role not in molding Lazar's story but in bringing him into the public eye. Of the many workers living in Las Vegas who would have known about alien craft at the Test Site, only Lazar had a friend who would believe him, want to know more and press him to go public with his story. According to Lazar, it was his \"field trips\" with Lear and companions to the Black Mailbox area that got him in trouble with his employers and eventually forced him, by a complex but understandable sequence of events, to make his public disclosures. T he speculation can go on and on. Theories about Lazar seem as numerous as the theorists and seem to reveal more about the person doing the talking than about Lazar himself. Some say his story is half true and half false, while others contend that Lazar has been brainwashed by the evil world government into thinking he worked on alien craft. There is a theory for every UFO subculture; each seems as good as any other, and all seem to tire with time. Does it matter? In my view, the Lazar question is like the riddle that Captain Kirk would pose to the evil robot to make the robot overload its memory banks and self-destruct. You can debate this one for hours and not get anywhere. I say, give it a rest. Most people seem obsessed with ab- solutes: They want to know right away whether a story is true or false. If they think it's true, they are willing to listen. If they think it's a lie, they'll dump it fast no matter what other insights it may offer. Most people want to see things as black or white; they can't tolerate gray. Like the robot, they'd rather burn out their circuits and blow smoke. I say, just relax and enjoy the story. Maybe Lazar is a fraud, and maybe his tale is no more real than Alice in Wonderland, but that doesn't mean we can't learn something from him. Some of history's great- est role models never existed. Sherlock Holmes didn't live at 221 Baker Street; Steed and Peel never solved a real Avengers case, and Mssrs. Spock and Data did not and will not ever roam the galaxy, but these and other fictional characters can sometimes teach us lessons we can apply to our own real lives. Like Holmes, Spock, Data, Steed and Peel, the Bob Lazar that is conveyed in interviews is a character of great intellectual discipline. He'll tell you the facts of what he directly observed but will not speculate about what they mean. He always draws a clear distinction about what he has personally experienced or deduced by his own logical processes and what he knows only from secondhand sources and cannot confirm. He seems com- fortable with the \"gray\" of not knowing and readily ad- mits the limits of his knowledge. Even with his own di- rect evidence, he continues to express skepticism about most UFO reports. \"It seems as if even knowing that we possess alien technology hasn't made you a believer.\" said one ques- tioner at a UFO conference. \"That's probably true,\" Lazar replied. I f Lazar's story is fiction, it's great fiction, filled with a richness of plausible details and complex philo- sophical dilemmas that you can't find in most popular novels these days. The briefing papers Lazar says he read indicate that the aliens have interacted with the human race for millennia, intervening in our genetic development and nudging us into a form of their choos- ing. It could be fiction, but it is a lot more tangible fic- tion about our origins than most religions seem to offer. Humans are referred to as \"containers\" in those brief- ing papers. Containers of what? The soul? Consciousness? Dwelling on these concepts awhile makes us remember how little we really know about ourselves. Sure, our bodies could have evolved from the primordial muck by wholly natural processes, but where did our consciousness come from? What are we made of, really, and if those aliens poured some special liquid into our otherwise empty containers, where did that substance come from? These are overload-the-mem- ory-banks questions that we will probably never satis- factorily answer even if the aliens reveal themselves, but they are still interesting to mull. GOVERNMENT SECRETS The Lazar story is far superior to most science fiction in creating a world that could be true. There is probably no better place on earth to put a secret saucer base, be it real or fictional, than at Papoose Dry Lake in Nevada's vast military restricted area. There is already at least one unacknowledged secret base next door, at Groom Dry Lake, and all the mechanisms of secrecy have long been in place here to keep virtually anything under wraps. The Cold War, and especially the arms buildup of the Reagan Administration, have left behind an imposing internal se- FEBRUARY 1994 NUMBER 310 PAGE 13"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL curity apparatus reminiscent of the KGB and fully ca- pable of keeping workers muzzled. Employment within the Restricted Zone is so compartmentalized and the funding pathways so convoluted that even our most privileged government leaders may not know every- thing that is going on here. Even if no \"secret saucer base\" ever existed in the Restricted Zone, just the fact that something this im- portant could be effectively hidden here is disturbing in itself. This country is supposed to be a democracy with strict controls on the power of government; yet here in Nevada we still have our own Berlin Wall with a mys- terious totalitarian regime hidden inside. Some level of secrecy will always be important to national security, but limitations on power are also a keystone of our freedom, and with the fall of the Soviets, the balance needs to change. When any government agency has reached a level of isolation where it can do what it wants without any accountability to its constituents, there is grave danger for democracy. History has shown that such power is inevitably abused, supporting more the jobs, egos and self-destructive crusades of the people who wield it than the needs of the nation. T\"?or decades, the military could hide virtually any- r thing behind the Soviet threat. In the shadow of bil- lion-dollar Star Wars projects, a small unauthorized re- search program like what Lazar describes could easily find funding and a secure niche in which to operate. Since the end of the Cold War, the justification for much of our military secrecy has become increasingly flimsy. Apart from the Saddam Husseins and disinte- grating republics that cannot possibly match our tech- nology, who does the military expect to fight—France? For all the absurdity of the status quo, it is unrealistic to expect the government to change on its own. While the existence of a base at Papoose Lake remains un- proven, the big Groom Lake facility has been widely re- ported in the popular press. The latest reports call this the home of a new high-speed spy plane dubbed Aurora. As of this writing, you can even view the base yourself from public land near Rachel. (The Air Force has ap- plied to seize this land so the opportunity may not last for long.) Soviet satellite photos of the Groom facility are freely available on the open market, and 1994 is expected to mark the implementation of the Open Skies Treaty in which many of our former Communist enemies will be permitted to overfly Groom and Papoose Lakes with so- phisticated reconnaissance aircraft. As America's most popular and best publicized secret base, Groom Lake's continued official nonexistence seems a classic exercise in the use of secrecy to suppress not foreign spies but domestic political opponents. The military loves se- crecy, even over its most mundane tasks, because it helps to neutralize critical oversight and disable Congressional opposition. The only credible enemy now is the American taxpayer, who wants some ac- countability for how his money is being spent, how his workers are being treated and how his land is being used. If the Lazar story, be it fact or fiction, attracts atten- tion to this place, then it is doing a service for our coun- try. Increased public attention and anti-secrecy activism may also be the only way we will ever find the truth of that story. If you shake the secrecy tree, then whatever is up there—flying saucers, Auroras or simply Cold War waste and mismanagement—will eventually fall out. You may or may not believe that the U.S. Government is keeping secrets about UFOs, but the fact that they could keep such secrets should be disturbing to everyone.

By Karl T. Pflock R ALF has landed in Roswell, New Mexico, and he has a job. He greets each of the thousands of visitors streaming into the International UFO Museum and Research Center at Roswell, founded by 1947 Roswell-Corona incident principals Walter Haul and Glenn Dennis and local civic leader Max Littell. A life-size (?) alien carved and donated by Eugene, Oregon, artist Steiner Karlsen, RALF (Roswell Alien Life Form) got his moniker in the museum's name- the-alien contest. The little fellow is one of many entertaining and informative attractions which, as I write this (August 1993), have brought over 14,000 visitors from all 50 states and 52 foreign countries to the nonprofit, free-admission institution since it opened its doors on October 24, 1992. The flood of interest has far exceeded even the most optimistic expectations of delighted cofounders Haul, Dennis, and Littell, who serve, respectively, as the museum's unpaid, volunteer president, vice presi- dent, and secretary-treasurer. Fortunately, they were able to lease adjoining space in May, nearly doubling available public floor area. CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF MANY KINDS After being greeted by RALF and one of the friendly human volunteers who help him out, visitors sign the guest book and push museum-supplied pins into a wall-mounted world map to show where they hail from. (I have suggested the museum add a star chart, just in case...) Then they can take advantage of two comfortable reading rooms filled with an evergrowing collection of donated books, magazines, scholarly papers, and other reference materials. Or they can browse through the many fascinating displays. Exhibits cover the July 1947 incident which put Roswell on the ufological map and other area and worldwide UFO events and news. Also included is a large, informative, and visually interesting survey of fundamental UFO facts prepared by the Center for UFO Studies and acquired in part with a grant from the Fund for UFO Research Most visitors will take advantage of the museum's favorite attraction, the large video room fitted with 47 donated planetarium seats. Here, free of charge, they can view one or more of 23 videos on a 25-inch color monitor. (The museum hopes to add a large video-pro- jection screen when resources permit.) Then there is the gift shop, filled with a large vari- ety of UFO-related items for sale. Included are books, monographs, video tapes, T-shirts, caps, coffee mugs, and much more. My personal favorites are the \"There Goes the Neighborhood\" T-shirt (one New Mexico antelope to another, as they watch dazed aliens stagger from their crashed saucer) and the \"RAAF Captures Flying Saucer On Ranch in Roswell Region\" headline coffee mug. RESEARCHERS MOST WELCOME. .. In addition to educating the public about UFOs in general and the Roswell incident in particular, the museum's founders are determined to do all they can to advance ufological research. For example, as a ufologist investigating the Roswell-Corona incident under a grant from the Fund for UFO Research, I recently spent 10 days in Roswell. The museum pro- vided invaluable assistance. Museum facilities were made available to me for witness interviews and other meetings, and the officers and volunteer staff cheerful- ly helped in every possible way. Similarly, the entire collection of UFO research materials was available for reference. Such courtesies are provided to all visiting ufolo- gists. The museum's research collection is open for study by students and the interested public as well and as the museum grows, research opportunities will increase in both number and scope. . . .DONATIONS, TOO Led and operated exclusively by unpaid volunteers, the museum and its programs are funded by member- ship dues, visitor donations, charitable grants, and gift-shop proceeds. A tax-exempt, nonprofit 501 (c) (3) organization, the museum welcomes monetary and in-kind contributions, all of which are fully deductible for federal income tax purposes. There are several levels of annual membership available—General ($25.00 a year), Sustaining ($50.00), Participating ($100.00), and Sponsor ($250.00)—each with its own set of benefits. Founding Members—the first 100 persons to con- tribute $100.00 or more—will haye their names engraved on a plaque to be displayed at the museum entrance. (At last count, only eight Founding Memberships remained available. Better hurry!) Lifetime Membership is available for a donation of $1,000.00. All members receive a membership card and a quarterly newsletter. Perhaps even more important to the museum's con- tinued success than monetary donations are tax- deductible contributions in kind.

Entitled \"Close Encounters: An Examination of UFO Experiences,\" the authors (Nicholas Spanos, Patricia Cross, Kirby Dickson, and Susan DuBreuil) present the following: \"Although research on the psychological character- istics of UFO reporters is almost all anecdotal, two gen- eral hypotheses have been formulated to account for such reports. The first hypothesis suggests that UFO reporters are psychologically or psychosocially dis- turbed and that UFO reports are symptomatic of per- sonal frustration, unhappiness, or psychopathology. Warren (1970) hypothesized that reports of UFO sight- ings were related to perceived status deprivation and subsequent feelings of frustration and alienation. Contrary to this hypothesis, Zimmer (1984) found that UFO reporters were as likely as nonreporters to be high academic achievers and failed to differ from nonre- porters in alienation, distress, or maladjustment. \"The second hypothesis holds that UFO reporters are fantasy-prone individuals who, under conditions of strong expectation and reduced reality testing confuse their vivid imaginings with external happenings. Individuals differ widely in their propensities for en- gaging in vivid fantasy activity. It is suggested that UFO reporters, particularly those who report close con- tact or communication with aliens, are fantasy-prone personalities. According to this hypothesis, individuals who believe in the possibility of extraterrestrial visitation are relatively likely to interpret ambiguous sensory in- formation in terms of this belief. When such individuals are also fantasy-prone, they tend to elaborate on the ambiguous information by weaving fantasies, inter- nally-generated sensations, and ambiguous external in- formation into a UFO experience that is congruent with their expectations. \"One purpose of the present study was to examine the psychopathology and fantasy-proneness hypotheses of UFO reports by comparing subjects who believed that they had sighted or made contact (or both) with UFOs (UFO reporters) with two groups of non-UFO reporters. Subjects in one comparison group were recruited from newspaper advertisements for participation in a study on personality. Subjects in the second comparison group were introductory psychology students who volunteered to participate in a study of personality. Subjects in all groups were administered a battery of objective inven- tories aimed at assessing psychological well-being, in- telligence, imaginal propensities, temporal lobe lability, paranormal beliefs, and hypnotizability. \"Subjects who reported UFO experiences were di- vided into those whose experiences were nonintense (e.g., seeing lights and shapes in the sky) and those whose experiences were intense (e.g., seeing and com- municating with aliens or missing time). The most im- portant findings indicate that neither of the UFO groups scored lower on any measures of psychological health than either of the comparison groups. Moreover, both UFO groups attained higher psychological health scores than either one or both of the comparison groups on five of the psychological health variables. In short, these findings provide no support whatsoever for the hypoth- esis that UFO reporters are psychologically disturbed. \"The four groups failed to differ significantly on the temporal lobe lability scale, on the three imaginal propensity measures and on the three indexes of hyp- notizability. The present findings fail to confirm either the psychopathology or fantasy-proneness hypotheses of UFO reports. Contrary to the psychopathology hypoth- esis, subjects in both UFO groups either failed to differ from or scored lower on the indexes of psychopathology than subjects in the two comparison groups. Subjects in the two UFO groups failed to differ from subjects in the comparison groups on any of the imaginal propensity measures, the temporal lobe lability index, the paranor- mal experiences index, or the hypnotizability measures. These findings clearly contradict the hypothesis that UFO reports — even intense UFO reports characterized by such seemingly bizarre experiences as missing time and communication with aliens — occur primarily in in- dividuals who are highly fantasy prone, given to para- normal beliefs, or unusually suggestible. \"To summarize: on a battery of objective tests sub- jects in these two groups did not score as more psy- chopathological, less intelligent, or more fantasy prone and hypnotizable than a community comparison group.\" Next column: \"Review of Symptomology\" UFOs, MJ-12 AND THE GOVERNMENT: A Report on Government Involvement in the UFO Crash Retrievals (113 pages) by Grant Cameron and T.

Some cases may be dated, but are \"current\" in the sense that they are just now being processed into the MUFON sighting report database. • Forty to fifty thousand inhabitants of the town of Aksaray-Nigde, Turkey, may have witnessed a brilliant, multi-colored glowing disk as it visited the area on sev- eral evenings in late December and early January, 1982; investigator, Selman Gerceksever. One witness interviewed was outdoors after dinner and heard neighbors \"almost in panic\" discussing an object high in the sky \"like a round tray,\" mostly bright red and green, with a white horizontal stripe bisecting its oval shape, and flashing red, blue, green and orange lights from around its sides \"too bright to look directly at.\" It rotated slowly on its axis as it moved slowly or hovered. It stayed at an altitude of 1000-1500 meters each time it was seen, on the evenings of 16, 18, 21, 25, 27 and 31 December, 1981, and was last seen on 2 January, 1982, as it came to a hover over the Tumosan Motor Factory for some time and just suddenly disap- peared.

The visitors and a local couple parked their car before nightfall and waited, through moonrise on 18 December, 1980, until they saw some \"small lights bobbing up and down on the horizon.\" The two women, one leaning on the car and the other standing up on a fence to watch this display both exclaimed nearly at once that they felt as if someone unseen had passed close to them. Retreating into the car, the four drove around to an- other field containing some horses and cows, where they again got out to watch for distant lights. They were standing in the moonlit field when a silence \"as if a vacuum\" descended; the horses and cows stopped feed- ing, became attentive a few seconds, then all ran past the four people towards some trees. Immediately a dull silver sphere, just smaller than a volleyball and no more than 10 meters above the heads of the witnesses, just appeared and glided silently toward the woods behind the fleeing animals. It disappeared be- fore it reached the trees, but from that direction issued 16 loud musical tones \"like an electronic flute wired to a very powerful amplifier.\" One of the witnesses is a trained musician, and worked out the memorable pattern of notes as: A, F#, D, B, A repeated twice, then D, B, A repeated twice, coming from no visible source. Log #931248J. • Sometime in July, 1981 a 25-year-old Brazilian farmer was walking home alone down a paved road after midnight in mist and fog, when he heard a metallic bang that echoed from behind a nearby hill; investigator, Cynthia Newby Luce. The man walked on to where he could see around the hill and saw a red disk, \"like two soup plates put to- gether ... the red of a car's taillights,\" 3 meters wide sus- pended 2 meters off the ground. It glided from 40 meters away to about 4 meters from the witness, who \"felt a ter- rific pull on him, as if the object were a magnet ... he wanted to flee but it took a tremendous effort for him to turn and run.\" He went to a nearby roadhouse that was open, too frightened to continue home, where the own- ers calmed the young man down and finally drove him the rest of the way to his home in their car. The object was no longer visible when they drove past the site of the close encounter. Log #931249J. • Three Canadians hunting ducks on Christian Island, Georgian Bay, Ontario, witnessed a bright, orange ball of light appear to their northwest at 18:15 hours; in- vestigator, Henry H. McKay. It was low on the horizon across a small lake from them, possibly out over the bay water. It illuminated the underside of the overcast clouds, estimated at 500-600 feet altitude, over a large area. It hovered for about half a minute, then descended rapidly below the trees and went out. There was no sound. The date was 1 November, 1980. Log #931219J. • At Boy Scout Camp McKenzie near Columbus, GA, it was not a train coming down the tracks that startled three witnesses in the early morning hours of 26 October, 1983; investigator, Jim Mapies. From inside a car at a railroad crossing, they could see at first only a very bright white light above a much smaller blue one, about six feet above the track. As it ap- proached it lifted up, revealing itself as a silent gray sphere with the two lights on its front, passing some 200 feet from the car and just disappearing suddenly. It left a \"feeling of euphoria\" in one male witness, age 28, who wanted to get out and \"investigate\" the area at 03:00 a.m., but he was outvoted by the other two and they drove quickly away.

Horizon Publishers, 1993. P.O. Box 490, Bountiful, Utah 84011-0490 Reviewed by Timothy H. Heaton T he thing that has struck me most in examining the UFO/abduction phenomenon is how poorly it fits into our two Western world views, the Judaeo-Christian and scientific traditions. While these two world views are themselves difficult to harmonize, it would seem that together they could encompass any new phenome- non that should come to view, be it physical or psychic in nature. UFOs, perhaps by design, show this not to be the case. What makes this phenomenon so interesting is that it defies being pigeon-holed into any familiar para- digm, and the existence of vehement debunkers, UFO cults, and government secrets only serves to prove the point. The message I take from this pervasive but enig- matic phenomenon is the need for open-mindedness— the ability to reach beyond everything we have ever conceived of as reality in order to bring it into focus. But being open-minded and living with uncertainty are rare qualities in our society. We want fast and straight an- swers from our government, from our abductees, and from our \"visitors\" themselves. Abductees suffer most from this uncertainty, being forced through lonely or- deals that defy all understanding, and those who drag their inner struggles into public light (like Whitley Strieber) only suffer ridicule and name calling for doing so. Most of us, abductees and interested bystanders alike, want a simple explanation for UFOs that doesn't uproot our comfortable view of the world. The book under review demonstrates—better than any I have read—how strong this need is to define, package, and pigeon-hole the UFO/abduction phenom- enon with minimal exercise of the mind. The author is a conservative Mormon, and his purpose is to expose and explain the UFO phenomenon to the Mormon au- dience. Being raised within the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints myself, 1 found the mix of Mormon cliches and typical UFO stories quite entertaining. Thompson devotes the first fifty pages to an extensive review of LDS quotations (mostly 19th century) con- cerning extraterrestrial life. None of these relate even re- motely to UFOs, and he could well have summarized his findings as follows: \"God has other children on other planets working under the same plan of salvation that we are.\" The reason for this long excursion is explained in the opening paragraph: \"In this Part I, revealed Gospel knowledge is used to establish parameters to the search for extraterrestrial life—to construct a paradigm within which to analyze the phenomenon. In other words, be- fore answering the question 'What is probable?,' the question 'What is possible?' must first be answered.\" The bottom line is clear: UFOs will fit into Mormon the- ology, one way or another. Thompson's approach is common among Mormon authors reviewing relevant topics of wider interest, from the Dead Sea Scrolls to near-death experiences. Mormons, like other such groups, feel they stand in a singular position to evaluate controversies. As Thompson puts it, \"Taking certain gospel principles to be true and universal, we have the advantage over most people who try to make sense of UFOs and their ex- traterrestrial occupants. With the Gospel as our guide we can further analyze the UFO 'message' to mankind.\" This attitude is ironic since modern LDS leaders have become almost anti-doctrinal and avoid controversial topics outside American conservatism. Last year they even went so far as to excommunicate several members for resurrecting the teachings of early church leaders, an event that must have made Thompson take notice. The next section of the book presents a thorough re- view of the UFO literature to lay out the general content of the phenomenon. Cases of Mormon sightings and abductions are treated next, from classic cases like Travis Walton and the Uintah Basin sightings to previ- ously unknown cases that Thompson has investigated himself. He concludes that Mormons are typical in every way in terms of the frequency and content of their en- counters. T hen the shoe-homing begins. The reader is treated to the most extravagant exposition on the New Age movement that I have ever witnessed, a string of odd quotations (colored with scathing footnotes) that leads one to believe that the antichrist is rapidly taking over the world. By documenting how Mormonism's founder, Joseph Smith, labeled all his prophetic competitors as messengers of Satan, Thompson justifies packaging all the loose tenets that some have called New Age into one \"counterfeit\" offensive fighting the Gospel of the Last Days. He even goes so far as to cite Old Testament passages instructing that persons of such ilk be put to death! This again is ironic since the millennial hopes of New Agers and Mormons differ in little more than ver- biage. Thompson concludes the book by taking the reader through a laborious taxonomy of what is and isn't pos- sible in the realm of UFOs and the supernatural, all un- der the assumption that \"any communication that fails to fit within this Gospel paradigm is false.\" Reminding his Mormon readers of the \"hateful demons that oc- cupy that plane in great numbers, entirely devoted to our FEBRUARY 1994 NUMBER 310 PAGE 19"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Using some curious arithmetic, the author has even calculated how many deceptive Satanic spirits there are per person on the planet. personal destruction,\" he devotes most of the text to linking UFO entities to Satan and the New Age. Based on some amusing arithmetic assumptions from Mormon doctrine, he even tells us how many Satanic spirits there are per person on the earth to deceive us. Along the way he has to dismiss the parallels, noted by Jacques Vallee and others, between Joseph Smith's visions and alien encounters. In the end Thompson fails to fully answer his own question, \"messengers or deceivers?\" He honestly doc- uments the confusing ambiguity of the phenomenon, but he can't get past the need to shoehorn it into his black and white world. He toys with the idea that the more benevolent entities might be angels of some type but warns that this \"scenario bypasses the latterday ec- clesiastical structure painstakingly put in place by the Heavenly Father.\" Since the bulk of encounters are clearly not of an angelic nature, he feels obligated to call them devils (i.e. if it isn't white, it must be black). The remaining ambiguity is accounted for by a \"gospel coun- terfeit\" explanation: \"Satan sends counterfeit messen- gers—glorious, radiant beings, praising God and com- manding the percipient to worship God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ, and none other. The messenger of light then proceeds to deliver a message that is 95% true. The five percent portion of the message, however, is generally deadly in terms of God's will in the matter.\" Let's hope that life isn't such a high-risk investment! In my opinion Thompson's link between UFO entities and Satanic tricksters is a poor one, even allowing for such deception. There is too much evidence that these entities don't understand us well and are genuinely cu- rious about our makeup to label them as brainwashed devils intent to destroy. Interestingly, Thompson's star abductee disallowed having her encounters evaluated in his scheme, though he couldn't resist the comment: \"In my opinion, Mary has suffered criminally at the hands of an evil, unknown personage.\" Thompson's philosophy makes perfect sense and is internally consistent in light of his initial assumptions about what is possible. But this is where he falls into er- ror. Religious elitism closes the mind with the illusion of opening it. There is an important lesson here that has wide application. Imagine a person with only black and white vision suddenly experiencing color (or a Flatlander experiencing a three-dimensional phenomenon for the first time) and not knowing how to evaluate it. A broader world view would be needed, and shoe-homing the new experience into an existing paradigm could only be frustrating and unproductive. We need to expand the possibilities, not restrict them. The UFO/abduction phenomenon shows no sign of coming to an easy resolution, for the more we realize how little we know about our visitors, the more we re- alize how little we know about ourselves.

MUFON To Support CAO Roswell Inquiry In a bold, decisive move to end the Defense Department's stonewalling on what it knows — and when it knew it — about the events, principals, and policies surrounding the so-called \"Roswell Incident,\" U.S. Rep. Steven Schiff (R-NM) has recently enlisted the aid of Congress's investigative arm, the U.S. General Accounting Office in Washington, DC. \"This opportunity to present several years' worth of investigatory evidence compiled by researchers from the private sector also offers everyone in the Mutual UFO Network a chance to help resolve the issue of what crash-landed in July 1947,\" said Walt Andrus, MUFON international director. \"First, our members are being encouraged to ask their congressmen and senators to support the GAO inquiry into the whereabouts of all official records pertaining to the event,\" Andrus continued. \"Second, the mainstream news media are invited to contact our various board members and technical consultants for whatever leads, background infor- mation, and perspectives that may be useful in directing a Watergate-style spotlight onto the case and its aftermath.\" Andrus pointed to MUFON's 25 years of serious, sustained research into the UFO enigma as being all the credentials necessary for the group's helping GAO investigators pry the lid from the Executive Branch's UFO Pandora's box. If the GAO inquiry leads to a full-scale congres- sional investigation into the overall UFO coverup, \"so much the better,\" Andrus concluded. Meantime, MUFON commends Rep. Schiff for his responsiveness, courage, and resolve in address- ing the concerns of his constituents in this matter.

EASTERN REGIONAL DIRECTOR ELECTION The names and qualifications of the three candidates' nominated for Eastern Regional Director appeared in the December 1993 issue of the Journal (page 20) along with a ballot for the members residing in the eastern states. (The District of Columbia is included with the eastern states, but was inadvertently left off the ballot.) The very qualified candidates are George A. Filer, Dana M. Schmidt and David F. Webb. If you have not already voted please do so, since the deadline for receiving ballots at MUFON headquarters in Seguin, Texas, is February 15, 1994. This prestigious position is only one of the four MUFON Board of Directors elected by the membership that they represent. RON JOHNSON'S NEW ADDRESS MUFON Deputy Director for Investigations, Jerold \"Ron\" Johnson recently moved to 11105 Scotland Well, Austin, TX 78750-3607. Original copies of all UFO sighting reports are to be routed in the following manner: (1) To the State/Provincial Director for his/her review for completeness; (2) To the appropriate Regional Director or Canadian National Director, and (3) Ron Johnson at the above address for his final disposition. After Mr. Johnson has thoroughly reviewed the reports, they are submitted to Dave Spencer for computer entry. Upon completion of Dave's work Ron Johnson delivers the original reports to the MUFON headquarters per- manent file in Seguin, Texas. (Normally, the prime in- vestigator will make a copy for his/her file before for- warding the report to the State/Provincial Director.) NATIONAL UFO INFORMATION WEEK Virginia M. Tilly, Director of Public Education, has an- nounced that the National UFO Information Week has been scheduled for August 13 through 21, 1994, which includes two weekends. Now is the time to start prepar- ing exhibits, information literature handouts, closed cir- cuit TV of video tapes and specifically making reserva- tions at local shopping malls and libraries. This is an ideal event to educate the public to the UFO phenome- non and its implications to the scientific future of the world.

His paper titled \"Ufology in the Commonwealth of Independent States: Organization Problems\" was published in the MUFON 1992 UFO Symposium Proceedings. Mark Blashak, Virginia State Director, appointed Don W. Lovett (Mechanicsville) to the additional re- sponsibility for Assistant State Director. Mr. Lovett was the M.C. at the MUFON 1993 Richmond Symposium. Leslie S. Mitts (Chattanooga) was promoted to Assistant State Director for Tennessee by State Director Randell Kjelland. Charles D. Flannigan, Florida State Director, selected two new Assistant State Directors, Gary A. Watson (Pensacola) for Northern Florida and G. Bland Pugh (Gulf Breeze) for Southern Florida. The following State Section Directors were selected this past month: Thomas D. Page (Santa Rosa, CA) for Sonoma County; Carlton Lunsford (Sausalito, CA) for Marin County; Randall 0.

MUFON ANNUAL AWARD Each year MUFON honors a person in Ufology who their colleagues select for having made the most out- standing contribution to the advancement of the UFO phenomenon during the past five years. The distin- guished recipient will be presented with an engraved plaque and a monetary award of $500 from MUFON. The deadline for ballots was December 31, 1993. Potentially, over 4,700 people could have voted for one of the candidates, however only a total of 160 votes were cast. This is approximately 3 percent of the MU- FON members that could have voted. A list of the can- didates nominated appeared in four consecutive month- ly issues of the MUFON UFO Journal with a request to vote promptly. A criteria of the election was that a sig- nificantly large popular vote was essential if MUFON was to continue this annual award. A three percent total vote of the members cannot be considered significant when recognizing someone for this prestigious award. The largest number of votes for any candidate was only 1.06 percent. It was originally believed that a postcard ballot cost- ing only 19 cents in the U.S.A. would not be a burden upon individual members, but apparently I was wrong. I accept the responsibility for misjudging the interest in this election and the poor turnout. On the other hand, over 4,300 members who did not vote are equally re- sponsible. This annual award is presented in good faith to hon- or an individual for their outstanding contribution to Ufology. In the current election for a new Eastern Regional Director, the pink ballots enclosed with the December 1993 issue of the Journal, are literally flow- ing into our MUFON office with a very favorable re- sponse (nearly 200 and still coming in). The members in the Eastern Region are to be congratulated for their prompt response. The enthusiasm for this election is in direct contrast to the poor response for the Outstanding Ufology Award. It is obviously apparent that an en- closed ballot is far more successful in eliciting a strong turnout. Based upon the fact that a significant number of votes were not received and the success of elections using inserted ballots in the Journal is very good, the MUFON Executive Committee has made the decision to conduct another election with the same eleven candi- dates. (The first election has been declared null and void.) We hope that the apathetic attitude of the first election will be dispelled by a large and significant number of votes to meet the criteria established to honor the recipient of this award. Ballots are enclosed with the February 1994 issue of the Journal for your conve- nience and vote. In order not to influence the election, but to rely en- tirely upon the individual's recognized accomplish- ments, only the candidate's name and state will be listed in alphabetical sequence. The following candidates were nominated for this honor: Edith Fiore (CA), John Ford (NY), Stanton T. Friedman (NB, Canada), Cynthia Continued on Page 23 PAGE 24 NUMBER 310 FEBRUARY 1994"}]
