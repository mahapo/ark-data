FROM THE EDITOR An important function of any serious UFO journal is to keep its readers informed of hoaxes and errors. In this issue we discuss some instances of questionable information that has been entered into the literature, and also some examples of borderline UFO sightings that may or may not be explainable. Occasional case studies of this type can be informative, and they can serve as examples to keep us on our toes. We cannot, however, devote the majority of space—all too limited— to that \"90%\" of IFOs. It is the \"10%\" of UFOs that promises to yield information of scientific value, and we intend to focus attention on the mystery, not on the smoke screen. Still, it is important to realize and keep in mind at all times that the vast majority of things that get reported as \"UFOs\" are natural or conventional objects, but not always obviously so. Careful and thorough investigation often is needed to identify the culprit. This smoke cloud always has obscured the important cases, and is mistaken by skeptics as being the entire story. Therefore, it is incumbent upon us to screen information and encourage thorough investigation in the process of singling out for attention those cases that establish UFOs as a real mystery.

Ad they drew nearer fcf the object, Meagan could see that whatever it was, it was encased by this pink light; a very bright, absolutely pink light. Both she and Andre were adamant about the colour of the light. It completely surrounded the craft ,• although Meagan could see no light which might 'have caused the glow. There were two~lights~\"~ on either side of an opening they could see in the side of the craft, and one on- top of it. The same pink glow seemed to . . emanate from within-the^opening. \"^^ \"As we-walked up towards^ the edge of the road, I could seethe crafF^ • - and as far as I am congg rne d ( ft was a craft of some soft_ was standing straight on the road, although the road itself is at a sfefit away from the edge ^^ where Wg-were.

The legs were about 1,22 meters high.\" ' What height was the craft above the legs? - \"Well, I'm not very good at estimating heights, but it must have been about that height altogether\" — indicating about 3,66 meters — \"When it was on the ground.\" How wide was the craft? \"It fitted nicely into the yellow lines on the road.\" When measured on site, I estimated this to be about 4,88 meters, but I feel there might be some doubt as to this. It was dark and the light distortive. There' seems to be some uncertainty about the width; it might 4 indeed have been narrower. : ,'( I asked Meagan what her impressions were at the time. \"I was very confused. I didn't know what it was.\" ^ Was she^afraid? \"\\ \"No, I wasn't afraid, because I thought it was some sort of aircraft, perhaps some experimental aircraft. It was unusual, but then you^get all sorts of unusual things nowadays^ She laughed loudly, \"I certainly didn't think _it was something from outer space.

One of the two near to us.was talking quite a lot and the other^one was answering in monosyllables. The one who was doing all the talking had a high-pitched voice, and the words sounded rather sing-song, but we couldn't actually hear the words, just the sound of it.\" Andre interrupted, \"I saw one of the men on the far side bend down and pick up some sand from the sandy bit ^ off the edge of the tarmac.

In the area, a considerable variety of minerals are ^mined, such as high grade manganese, iron, and asbestos. ^There_are three uranium plants within tKe^muriicipal \"area of Krugersdorp. -The Mindalore case was brought to, my attention by a local newspaper report in The Herald, ~a leading RHcfdesian newspaper, and I managed to contact the witness, Mrs. Quezet, who ;agreed for me to int,ery.iew,her-ii I flew down to SoutrTAffica. This I managed to do on the afternoon of Friday, January 12, 1979.

They had arranged to drive me to-Mrs. Quezet'sj, house immediately^ after eating supper and we actually arrived there shortly after 8:15 PM.

Meagan told me that late on , Wednesday' evening, January 3, 1979, she was sitting in the lounge finishing off a book she had been reading. She remembers booking at the clock and noting that '(it was 10 minutes to midnight. Just then her elder son Andre came into the living room saying that he had*been unable to sleep and could he make a cup of tea for both of them? Meagan readily^agreed. She'said, \"I\" think Andreiwas getting.bored with the school hSlidays\"—in South Africa the long, summejr hojidays occur during Declhiber/January^'and he was also ^anxious to\"start\"High x School.\" It was then she fieafcbtheir part-,- bred Daksie dog, Cheeky; ''barking outside, pheeky had recently been knocked down by a passing motor-car and his back had been, badly damaged.

Meagan went outside and called to Cheeky but she soon realized that he had managed tg^get outside/thVgates'and she knew that if she left him, he would bark and bark and disturb jthe neighbors. She went to their front gate calling to the dog, but by that time Cheeky had ^gone up, the road. Realizing that Cheeky; wouldsopner come to Andre than to her.'Meagan shouted for him to come and help.her get Cheeky back into the garage., \"I was* 1 also worried about the area,\" Meagan said. \"There are always people wandering about -^after dark and Kwanted Andre to come with me up the road to find Cheeky.\" No 14, Saul Jacobs Street is about micTway up\" the street. At the top there is a T-junction, and the road crossing .A there is called TindalJ Road. However, v-beyond that, about,12. meters further up, there is a road running parallel to Tindall Road, which actually has no. -'connection with it at all. This is a newly- made road, a connecting (ink between the factory' area of Chamdor and Luipaardsvlei Industrial Area, and used mainly by heavy traffic during the day. Very little traffic passed that way during the night. When they neared Tindall Road, Meagan saw Cheeky still barking frantically, together with most of the neighborhood dogs. At the same time, she became ~aware'of a bright pink light on the top road. She said to Andre, \"Look, .they've got lights on that road ;up\"thereT\" -~^>^^^ \"No, there -aren ! t- any lights up .^feifMorti;\" he replied. \" \"Well tHS\". what's that very odd looking thing trief 6 ?\" Meagan queried, pointing to the pinTTgJow she could see above the road.

She said it.might have been a police car with its light on the roof, but she couldn't hear anything and normally the police car light had a sort of 'whoo-whoo' sound to it.

They were definitely white .. they had this pinkish effect from the light\" Was there a sheen to'the suits? \"No, just absolutely white.\" Did they notice the colour of the craft? \"It was a metallic-lead colour. That was the impression I got,\" Meagan said. \"It had no contours to it, no fins or anything like that, just smooth.\" Andre added, \"The colour was like a fishing weight — like the ones we use when we go fishing.\" Meagan said, \"The body of the craft was quite smooth. I could see nothing on the sides at all. There might have been something on the other side, but I didn't get to see that. I would have loved to have gone round and inspected the other side, but you know, you only think of these things afterwards.\" Meagan noticed that the bearded man was looking at her all the time. Still looking at her, he bowed low to the waist and said something. Meagan thought it was a greeting of some sort. All the time, his eyes never left hers. Andre said, \"The man said something with three syllables in it. I heard it quite clearly.\" Sheepishly, Meagan said \"Hello\" and laughed nervously. She said, \"The one with the beard, whom I presumed was in charge, had ordinary black hair. But his skin was dark, like the Middle Eastern people, a sort of olive. But he wasn't black.\" Meagan felt herself drawn to the man with the beard. She laughed, \"I have always liked men with beards.\" She couldn't see the colour of their eyes, but the bearded man's eyes were quite normal, like an ordinary person's eyes. I asked if they were slanted, or large and round. Meagan said, \"No, but I must tell you something. I don't know if this means anything or not. I had the impression that the bearded man's eyes were quite translucent, as though I could look through his eyes. I kpow it sounds a silly thing, and maybe it was a reflection of the pink light in his eyes.\" While the man greeted her and bowed, Meagan just stared at him. And then suddenly, for the first time since the sighting, she had a feeling that something was not quite right! Somefh/ng was not quite normal. Andre was standing slightly behind her and to her left. She said to him, \"Andre, go and get Daddy, and run, please run.\" Meagan said, \"I think I shouted at Andre, loudly.\" Andre said, \"I ran straight away. I was frightened. I didn't expect to see anything like this.\" I asked if they thought the men appeared to be threatening. Meagan said, \"Well, he spoke to me and I just stared at him. Then he said something to the other man and that one in turn said something to the others. They weren't having any lengthy conversation, just sort of mono- syllables.\" But the next thing she knew, they had jumped back into the craft. I asked if they had climbed in through the doorway, and if so, were -there any steps? \"No, there were;no' 'steps, but the.opening was about 1,22 meters off the ground. The door was in the middle of the far side from us. But they just stepped in.\" \"Did they jump up?\" I asked.JYes,. but I \"didn't get any impression of any effort going into it; they didn't heave themselves up. They just stepped up. And then one moment the door was open and the next moment it was closed. I didn't see the door close.\" : Within seconds of the door shutting, Meagan heard a buzzing noise. She described it as sounding \"like bees in a hive\" — that was the closest she could get to the sound. And then suddenly, the legs elongated to about three times their length. \"The legs came from the bottom end of the craft and they elongated to the size of the craft itself when it stood on the gound.\" \"So that the overall height would now have been about 6,1 meters high?\" I asked. \"Yes, I would think so.\" In the meantime, Andre who had been going down the embankment as fast as he could in the dark, stopped when he heard the buzzing noise. Meagan herself stepped back. She was afraid; she didn't know what was going to happen next. She said, \"I was a bit frightened. I didn't know whether to run or what. (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"(Mindalore, Continued) And then suddenly the object seemed to right itself; it went slightly to the left from where it was. Then the legs started telescoping into the craft. I must tell you I hadn't thought of that word 'telescoping' — the legs just started to withdraw into the craft, but one of-the reporters who came to interview us, suggested that the legs 'telescoped' into the craft, and it is a much better word. The legs went straight up into the craft. It hovered for about a second or two and then it shot off into the sky, very quickly. The clouds were very low that night. The whole thing looked just like a pink light and it went straight up into the clouds and disappeared in about 30 seconds. But the clouds were coloured that pink colour for quite a while after it had gone.\" I asked how long it was from the _ time they first saw the object until jt tOOk Off.   r \"I think it was about 10 minutes,\" Meagan said. \"It's difficult to time time when you don't have a watch.\" She laughed. \"I can tell you it seemed much longer. I remember.my mouth going dry rribly dry, when I shouted to Andre. to go and call his-Dad. I was scared stiff then. I am an outgoing person, so I was very interested in what was going on all the time but just the same, I was frightened! I can't explain it to you; it is the most unusual thing I have ever seen in my life.\" When the craft took off, what did she do? \"I watched it for some time and Andre had come back to the top of the embankment again by this time. He'd stopped running when he heard the buzzing noise. And then as he came to stand beside me, I said to him. \"You see, it's gone up.' He was watching and he just said, 'Yes, I can see.'\" I asked if they had any impression of power when the craft moved off? \"No. It was a slightly windy night but I didn't get any impression of jets or flame or anything like that, or even any extra wind. It was quite chilly and windy, but no different from how it had been before.\" What did they do next? \"We just stood there for a moment or two, quite flabberghasted.\" Then they walked quickly down the hill to Top road showing width of object, Andre in background. jtheir_house.^Meagan's intention was to wake her husband up immediately, but as they, walked home she realized that there was nothing he could do. After all, the craft had gone! Paul was manager of a workshop and his hours were long and hard. He was always tired and Meagan mentioned that he was afraid that the stress and strain of his work would lead to a heart attack. He went to work early and came home late. Meagan felt she would not be justified in waking him now to tell him the story. The morning would do just as well. Andre however, wanted to wake his father right away and tell him the story. \"No,\" Meagan said. \"We won't wake Daddy because he is so tired and what could he do about it now anyway?\" She said she had thought about it and decided against it. \"He doesn't get enough sleep as it is.\" Meagan and Andre sat in the lounge for a little while discussing the event. I asked if they had thought of phoning the police. \"No,\" Meagan said. \"It didn't occur to me. I thought it was something unusual but I really didn't know what to do about it. In any case, by this time it was 10 minutes to one, so.ljhought the best thing we could do was to go to bed.\" In the morning, Andre decided to test out the story on his younger brother Gary. Andre said, \"Would you believe me if I told you \" When Andre had outlined the story of the night before, Gary said \"No,\" very firmly. Then Andre phoned his father who had gone to work before they were awake. Paul was a bit skeptical at first, but then Andre told him \"that Meagan had also seen the craft with him. Meagan says, \"I spoke to my husband and told him the story. I asked him what he thought it could be and he said. 'It must be a UFO. It sounds like a UFO.' He asked me if it was really true, did it really happen? And then he said I must phone the newspapers.\" Meagan had noted recently, while driving in town, a sign which had said \"Associated Newspapers.\" So she decided to phone them, although she was almost certain they would think she was crazy. \"But Andre saw- the same thing as I did; we can't have made it up or sucked it out of our thumbs,\" she said emphatically."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"' When she phoned the news- papers, a man there said, \"Just a moment. I want you to talk to one of my colleagues about this. I'll phone you back.\" \"This he did,\" Meagan said. \"And they asked Andre if he had seen Star Wars or Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Andre said 'No.' He was- feeling so embarrassed about the whole thing.\"\" \" - Since then, Meagan and Andre and the Quezet family have been inundated with phone calls and callers, some from newspapers, some from private people. There have been hoaxes, cruel ones, for no rhyme nor reason, but naturally one has to accept that there are mentally ill people all over the world. One of the calls was from a man who purported to be from the Dai7y Mirror in London. He gave a name and an address and told Meagan in return for exclusive rights to,the-story, his paper would fly her. ;and* her.; family to - England and France for two weeks holiday, all expenses paid. She did not expect to make any money from her story, but it was a wonderful offer and she was delighted to accept. They arranged to call on her at '2- PM on 'Saturday, January 13. The Quezet family were terribly excited about the prospect of the trip; Paul had not been home to France for • many years. But on the Saturday, no one turned up. Nor did anyone phone. The basis of such a hoax seems completely sick to me. - Meagan also had genuine calls from England and America. The National Enquirer wanted to put her under hypnosis, but she was wary of this: 'She said, \"Andre is a 12 year old and going through a difficult age. 1 1 don't like hypnosis. I told them I would undergo a lie detector test anytime they 'wanted me to, but hypnosis, that is something quite different.\" She laughed. \"Perhaps if they arrange to insure me while I am undergoing the hypnosis, I might do it. Because things happen under hypnosis. The hypnotist might say, 'What-happened when'.you went into the craft?' and they could-be suggesting things to me which I know I didn't do.\" I explained to Meagan that whilst I felt one could not accept the total reliability of regressive hypnosis, I did not feel it would harm her. At the time however, Meagan would not change her mind. On Thursday, January 4, Meagan and Andre went back to the spot where the craft had stood. They could see nothing.unusual. There were no marks on the tarmac and although the sand on the side of the road where the men had stood was a bit disturbed, there was also a ditch nearby where men were working to place a pipe in position. \"There were sections of the ditch which had not yet been filled in, so it could have been something to do with that,\" Meagan said. 'I asked if they had noticed any physical after-effects, but Meagan said \"No.\" An interesting : point of note is that Meagan had started her menstrual period a week earlier than expected, and immediately after the incident. This was not normal for her and she was surprised that I asked, but said she felt herself that it might have been due to the stress and excitement of the incident: On Sunday, January 14, Lindsay (my daughter) drove : me back to Mindalore. Meagan, Andre, and Cheeky (the dog) led us to the spot on the road where the craft had stood. 1 timed our walk from the house, which was quite leisurely, to the embankment at the top, and it took less than 5 minutes to reach. Beyond the top road (we cannot at the moment trace the name of this highway) and on the side away from the houses, there is a large stretch of open ground. To the left and far in the background — certainly a few hundred meters away — there is an old mine dump. Meagan told me that we were standing on the site of an old gold mine.   ' ' • '''••' I noticed immediately that where Meagan and Andre indicated the craft stood, was almost directly under some electrical power lines (see picture). This was the only part of the road where the power lines crossed: There were no other power lines in the vicinity. : As I stood on the spot where the craft had been, I called to Cheeky and he came to me readily, so he showed no fear of the area, and there was Obviously no scent which he could be afraid of. However, it is important, to Electric power lines within few meters of landing site. note that there had been some heavy rains in the area since the night of January 3/4 which' might have destroyed any ground evidence. There were no signs of burn marks on the tarmac, and as there was no foliage in the immediate .vicinity, I could look for no evidence there. I examined the ground ; closely on either side of the road to a depth of about 2-3 meters, but could detect nothing untoward. Where the men had been' working, the ditch was not filled in, so any evidence of the sifting of the sand would have 'been destroyed by now. I was subsequently in contact with Dr. Wim Ahlers of the University of Witwatersrand Planetarium. He told me he had no reason to doubt that Mrs. Quezet and Andre were telling the truth. Frank Morton, of whose credentials 1 am unaware, but who styles himself as UFO consultant to the Planetarium, informed me later that when questioning the neighbors, it had been learnt that Meagan Quezet was a highly imaginative woman. Morton has subsequently labelled the whole incident \"a hoax\" although I am still waiting to hear on what reasons he has based his assumption. My impressions on the telephone of Mr. Morton were good, although 1 must admit he referred to a well-known UFO case in relation to Meagan Quezet's report, and his reference was inaccurate! On the Sunday, I had occasion to talk to Paul Quezet alone. He said, \"My wife is a highly strung person, but she would not lie.\" ' What has worried me most about this case is the time factor: Meagan had noted the time Andre first came into the lounge which was 10 minutes to midnight. She had looked at the clock (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"CLOSE ENCOUNTERS WITH E-M AND PHYSICAL EFFECTS By Raymond E. Fowler On January 6, 1979 at 0035, I received a telephone call from the Massachusetts State Police Headquarters, Boston. At 0022, they had received a teletype message from the Sturbridge State Police Barracks, concerning several UFO sighting (Mindalore, Continued) again shortly before she and Andre went to bed, and it was then 5 minutes ito one in the morning. It took them 5 minutes walk (maximum estimate) to the top of the embankment, either way. Assuming it was about 5 minutes before they left the house to look for the dog, and 10 minutes watching the craft on the ground (I think this time factor is questionable, I would say much less time was involved) would account for 25 minutes of time. . Assuming they spent about 10 minutes discussing the event after they returned to the house (again, I think this is over-estimated) this would bring the total time accounted for, up to 35 minutes. And yet, Meagan looked at the clpck at 10 minutes to midnight and 5 minutes to one, a total time of 65 minutes. Personally, I think there is a discrepancy of about 30 minutes plus or minus! On January 25, after I had been back in Rhodesia for a week, Lindsay phoned to say that Meagan had now agreed to undergo hypnosis, but only if I was present at the same time. I phoned through to her immediately pointing out that it was too expensive for me to fly down again, but that I could arrange for a reliable psychiatrist to do the regression, and she had agreed. I am hot sure when this will be done, but I am hoping to have a full report of that available in the near future. In the meantime, I present the case of Meagan and Andre Quezet as it stands. 8 reports they had received on the evening of 5 January 1979 and shortly after midnight, in the early morning hours of 6 January 1979. The Charlton Police Department reported to the Sturbridge State Police that they had received a \"Big-Foot\" creature sighting on the evening of 5 January 1979. (They also had a similar report on 28 December 1978). One caller had reported a \"diamond-shaped object\" which hovered 100 feet over her car. Another called on the morning of 6 January and .said that UFOs had caused a traffic jam along Route 49 during the early evening hours of 5 January 1979. One caller did identify himself — Tom Emery, who lives with his parents in Springfield. Tom Emery had called on behalf of his sister who had experienced a close encounter with 3 UFOs while travelling along Route 90 to visit her parents. I f called his sister Anmarie Emery, and taped a telephone interview with her on the morning of 6 January. 1979 and on the evening of 7 January 1979, while she visited her parents. I visited her personally on the evening of 12 January 1979, at her apartment in Boston. Anmarie departed her place of employment (a hotel in Cambridge) at about 1820, 5 January 1979 to visit her parents' home at Springfield. She had hoped to leave earlier but had to catch up some work first so got a later-than- planned start. She proceeded with no stops other than about a 5-minute delay at two toll-booths. She first noticed 3 red-glowing, triangular-appearing objects flying over woods to her left (South) shortly after She passed through the Auburn area at the junction of Route 90/290. They were flying in precise formation about 54 mile from the road. She noticed several cars that had slowed and assumed they were watching the objects. They looked strange so she slowed, put down her Massachusetts UFO, January 5,1979 driver's window to listen for an aircraft engine sound but could not hear anything. The objects glowed all red and had red-blinking lights to their rear. (See sketches). At one point, she thought she saw four but realized that it was just a flashing red beacon atop the Massachusetts Turnpike Maintenance Depot radio tower. She had slowed to view them through the open window just about 100 yards beyond this tower. Anmarie was driving a 1970 Ford Maverick. Her radio (AM) was playing and tuned to WHYN. Her CB radio was on but with the volume turned down. There was moderate traffic. When she reached the Route 90/86 interchange, all other traffic exited to Route 86 (Sturbridge/Conn- ecticut/New York) and she found herself travelling alone. About a mile after this interchange, she climbed a hill and turned a corner. There was no traffic in her west-bound lane and the east-bound lane was blocked from view by a hill. When she rounded the corner, she sighted 3 glowing red craft hovering over the road directly in front of her car. Simultaneously, her radio stopped playing, the CB radio light blinked out and its indicator needle dropped, and the car slowed smoothly to a full stop. Please note that the car has standard"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"transmission and was in 3rd gear and the engine continued to run! Anmarie became totally paralyzed and could not move except her hands shook a bit as she gripped the steering wheel. Her foot remained on the accelerator pedal which remained depressed but the car would not move. The red light from the closest object was so bright [hat she felt the heat on her face. A strong pungent odor filled the car which she described as a \"sweet skunk smell.\" The objects were in the same type formation that she had noted earlier when they were flying in the distance. The closest was only 20 feet away and 10 feet above the road. The second hovered to its right, at the same height, but about 40 feet away. The third hovered to the first's left, at the same height, but about 60 feet away. The objects appeared to be shaped like 4-sided pyramids with their apexes facing her. They appeared to be made of a smooth glass-like substance. The red light seemed to be emanating from withtin the objects but had no noticeable point source as the glow was uniform all over. Four brighter red, blinking portions protruded along either side of the back of the objects as if there were four red bars located at the rear of each that were protruding. They blinked slowly, once every 2 seconds. Anmarie felt totally mesmerized and although the face-off seemed to last a long time, she estimates the close encounter was only 2-3 minutes in duration. Her face felt hot and flushed and her eyes watered. Then, a distant headlight could be seen in her rear-view mirror. Concurrently, the objects accelerated straight up, one at a time. The nearest one left first followed in succession by the next nearest and the farthest craft. They all moved away at an altitude of about 300 feet. Each had swung around at \"about like a 2-o'clock position\" and they all moved away and disappeared behind a distant hill toward the northwest. The objects were out of sight in about 30 seconds. As soon as they left, Anmarie's AM radio began playing, the CB radio light blinked on and the needle swung up and her car began to move. She could now move. She arrived home sometime after 2000. Her mother saw her flushed face | Mark R.

In any event, she told them what had happened. She did not want to call the police because she felt that they would not believe her so her brother Tom phoned the Sturbridge State Police barracks. They in turn teletyped the data to Boston State Police Headquarters who phoned me. The flushed appearance/feeling of her face disappeared. There was a bit of rash or peeling of skin around her eyes and above her nose on the following day which healed quickly. Her automobile is operating fine. The paint on the hood shows no sign of blistering or peeling. An interesting feature about the objects was the way they turned. The nose would drop about 45 degrees in a turn. The nose also dipped while they were in the hovering mode in front of the car. Unfortunately, Anmarie never saw the full back of the objects so we do not have a detailed description of the blinking red lights/bars(?) 1978 MUFON SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS (131 Pages) A SURVEY OF CEIII REPORTS FOR 1977 by Ted Bloecher, New York NY Co-Chairman of Humanoid Study Group and MUFON State Section Director 1 967: THE OVERLOOKED UFO WAVE AND THE COLORADO PROJECT by Richard H.

Nelson (This report illustrates problems of investigation and evaluation in borderline UFO reports that contain some \"typical\" UFO-like features, but in which witness psychology and subjective impressions play an important role. The lighting conditions and the generally \"low\" performance of the objects might suggest aircraft, but some details — if accurate — would contradict this explanation. —Editor) On Wednesday evening, September 27, 1978, at 9:20 PM, Earl Goff, 20 was sitting in his upstairs apartment bedroom in Orange, California, watching TV when a flash of light out the window caught his eye. He saw a lighted object which at first looked triangular, or boomerang- shaped, because of the arrangement of lights. It hovered at an estimated 200 to 300 feet above the ground and he could see it straight in the east approximately Yt mile away above the apartments and beyond some trees. Because it looked so odd, he raced downstairs and across the street, and banged on the door of his young married friends, Pat (21) and Sue Campbell (19), yelling for them to come out and see what he saw. They came into the street and all claim amazement. \"It's a UFO, isn't it?\" Earl asked. Pat Campbell admitted that was a direct suggestion, but he was hard pressed to think what else it might be. It hovered in that spot perhaps 1% minutes. They saw a number of very bright steady white lights in two rows, with a blinking red light centrally located among them. All the lights went off and another light beamed down to scan the ground, a vacant field, Earl thought. Its size at that time was claimed to be a hand width at arm's length (or almost 340 feet wide at 1300 feet away); however the boys later guessed its size at 150 feet wide, while wondering if that weren't an /• / <A I <o / u r-ux- _.&*•«•'» _ ka4e.Ua Apparent course of UFO, September 27, Orange, California. underestimate. The object then moved south for a half block, coming directly over Katella Avenue. It began heading west toward them, right above the busy street. Earl cried out for anyone to get a camera, but no camera was available. Two other neighbors came out to watch, Margaret Murphy (43) and her daughter, Shelly. Earl and Pat ran down Shaffer Street to the corner at Katella and watched the object slowly approach, seemingly just above the 50-60 foot telephone poles along the street. It moved precisely and silently, \"as though by mind control.\" Cars under it were passing it since they were going approximately 40 mph while it rolled along at 15-20 mph. As it neared, they could see it really was a lens-shaped object. The top half above the lights appeared darker, \"a faded brown.\" It seemed huge. Pat said it must have been 8 hands across as it reached the intersection at a 60-degree angle above them. At the estimated 200-300 foot elevation, it would be 300- 350 feet wide. Whatever its size, Pat said Katella Avenue, a four-lane boulevard, \"was like a runway for it — it seemed to overhang the street's edges. It made no noise at all. No type of combustion noise.\" Earl was waving his arms and screaming at traffic to stop and look up. Some may have pulled to, the curb, he didn't know. They may have thought him a madman. At the intersection the object stopped to hover for 30 seconds. All other lights turned off again, and the \"strange white light shone bright on the ground around us.\" This scanning light made a complete 360-degree sweep around them at about 75 feet distance. It didn't shine directly on them. It was odd, bluish, shadowless. \"There were no reflections.\" They felt as though they were being watched. Pat even had the irrational thought, he admitted ruefully: \"Take me.\" Earl admitted fear in the midst of his excitement. The spotlight went out, the other lights went on, and the object began 10"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"moving again, emitting a small sound like the wind as it started. It angled across the neighborhood, going northwest toward Glassell Street, then changed to northeast toward Trenton Avenue, then eastward back toward its original position, always at the same elevation. Each change of direction was sudden. \"The next moment it was just moving in a new direction. Beautiful control. Very steady and smooth.\" At this point Pat was on a garage roof, Earl in the street below. It had far outpaced their running efforts to keep up. After transiting the neighborhood, it hovered about 10-15 seconds in its original position while the scanning light searched the ground once more. It then moved directly south, going out of their view over the trees and housetops. The behavior was \"as though it was looking for something\" and the observation time had lasted a total of 5-6 minutes. ..Helicopter? At this point the question naturally arises whether this was a police helicopter. Orange police do not have a helicopter and they said that they did not request helicopter assistance from any other agency that evening. Anaheim, the nearest city with a police helicopter, has a Hughes 300 \"with a quiet kit,\" according to Helicopter Sergeant Webb. It has a 1.3 million candle power searchlight and when it is on, the other lights probably would not be visible because of contrast. For September 27 the Anaheim police log shows that it was north of the city of Orange at 8:55 PM, and at the corner of Katella and Tustin Avenues at 9:02 or 9:03. This latter location is only Y 2 mile farther east and in line with the line of sight of Earl Goffs first noting the object. However, the police record shows the helicopter logged in at the west end of Anaheim, 9.33 miles away, at 9:16 PM. It would have averaged 43 mph (not 15-20) to cover the distance in that time, and the police logs appear accurate within a minute or two. Also, the UFO departed in a southerly, not a westerly, direction. The matter of time becomes crucial here. Earl, Pat, and Sue claim the time of the sighting to have been between 18 and 20 minutes after 9:00 PM. Further comments by the Orange Police Centrex Operator, Res. Off. Collins, are interesting. Officer Collins stated he received a call that night which he still remembered 10 days later. \"The person said she saw a large black object. It appeared as if the sides were bending downward. Like a disk.\" Pressed for the time or the identity of the caller, he said it had to be close to 9:00 PM, but he couldn't add any more detail. He volunteered, \"I hope you can resolve something on that,\" indicating a frank interest in the events that evening on the part of the police. Sue Campbell had also called the police at 9:30, and Earl Goff says a police cruiser came around the intersection of Shaffer and Katella 10 minutes after the call. It is tempting to speculate that the overhead \"black object\" was the same object that later attracted Earl Goffs attention as it lit up with a flash. Al Lawson, another investigator in this case, talked to Orange police the day after the sighting. Mike Leintz, dispatch officer, stated to Al that \"two people sighted some dark black object\" on the call that Officer Collins had taken. \"When the second person called\" (probably Sue Campbell) \"they were told another person had already reported the same thing.\" Lynda T. (35), an instructor at Federal Truck Drivers' School in Orange, independently saw the Wednesday evening event. She lives in the same apartment complex as, Pat and Sue Campbell, and knows them. Says Lynda, \"I just stepped out in back of my apartment and saw it. I thought it was my imagination, or that my eyes were playing tricks on me. It must have been about 9:30 PM. Yes, it cast a light down. It was moving west along Katella.\" Mrs. Margaret Murphy and daughter Shelly were neighbors who came out to view the object after Earl's initial call for witnesses. Reportedly they were willing to be interviewed by me, but before I was able to talk to them there was a near-tragedy in their family, so it became inappropriate to pursue an interview at this time. For whatever it is or isn't worth, it might be noted that these days of September 27-29 encompassed a large solar magnetic storm which affected communications on earth, according to General configuration of UFO, September 27-29, 1978, Orange, California astronomers. Second Sighting On Friday evening, September 29, 1978, the group of friends were sitting on the lawn in front of Earl Goff's apartment \"as they usually do.\" Earl, Pat, and Sue Campbell, Vila and Charlie were five of the group. Also present were several \"older people\" — Linda T. (an independent witness of the previous Wednesday event) and Doug W. (29) her friend, also an instructor at the Truck Driver's School. Earl's mother, Marge, who lives in the city nearby, was also reported to be present, but because of her business connections she apparently does not wish to be contacted as a witness. She did say, \"It's all very interesting. The witnesses all seem to agree,\" about what happened next. Vila was saying: \"It'll never come back to the same place twice!\" It was 8:55 PM. Suddenly a Hash of light drew the attention of the group to the east and Earl and Pat were certain that Wednesday's UFO had come back again! And in the same spot as before. The others were in various states of uncertaintly as to what they were seeing. Let's start with Sue Campbell's testimony. \"I'm not sure of their shape but they were gigantic lights, not points, 3 maybe 4 in a row. It was like Wednesday when I was just amazed at the brightness of the lights, but this time they were in a different pattern.\" Color? \"I saw no red, like Wednesday. Others did. Just the white.\" Shape? \"So dark. Couldn't be sure of any shape. Maybe a dark shape. Same problem as Wednesday with the strong lights — getting the eyes adjusted to anything behind them. Except it was a more definite shape Wednesday.\" How did (continued on nexf page) 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"(Orange, Calif., Continued) you know about it? \"The flash, and there it was. Sort of like it appeared from nowhere. Like a light bulb that burns out when you turn it on, you know?\" Location, movements? \"More to the south than Wednesday, but maybe even closer and lower.\" Linda T. and Doug. W. said they both saw \"the second one\" on this Friday night. Said Doug, \"It was very slow at first. Three giant big lights. Like great big white spotlights. No shape to lights. Made out a shape to the craft like an inverted saucer. I never paid any attention to UFOs and I sure don't go out looking for the things but, like they say on TV, it was like two saucers, one inverted on the other, with big lights where they joined. It accelerated fast, then, to the south. It had one blinking red and green light, one port and one starboard Blinked about one time per second \" He insisted he'd seen a lot of aircraft and helicopters when he was in the Navy and knew what they looked like. When I suggested it might have been a large aircraft with landing lights on, first pointed at them, then banking to the south, he rejected that. \"It was too erratic to be an airplane, it moved back and forth. It was hard to see a shape behind the lights, but it moved so fast when it did move that I couldn't connect it with an airplane.\" Doug sent me-a sketch of what he thought he saw. He strikes me as a forthright, responsible person. Among other things, he talked about wanting to institute a much-needed class in driving safety at the truck drivers' school. Meanwhile, Earl Goff was ready this time. He'd borrowed a movie camera the day before, hoping that the Wednesday UFO would return so he could get some record of it. He and,Pat had spent nearly the whole previous night on a garage roof, waiting. He ran into his apartment to get the camera. He said when it reappeared it seemed that it would repeat the same pattern of movements as on Wednesday, but when he started filming \"it just faded back quickly, like it didn't want to be filmed.\" Pat reiterated this. \"At first it came down close in front, but it got away fast when we started filming. Like it knew.\" Next began the great UFO chase. 12 Pat and Earl jumped into their car and followed it south along Shaffer Street at 40-50 mph. This time the UFO did not move serenely: \"It was making abrupt movements like I've never seen anything make before,\" said Pat. During the chase, they claim they lost sight of the UFO and resighted it approximately three times. From Shaffer they reached Collins and turned east toward Tustin Avenue. It seemed to be hovering \"like it was waiting for us to take footage.\" They shot some footage while it was over a large open space (schoolyard). Then it took off again, moving in many different directions but generally in a southerly direction. They said it was a bumpy ride and the film would show the UFO bouncing. They were going south on Tustin, a four-lane street, making all of the green lights. They entered the Garden Grove Freeway, westbound, because the UFO then seemed to be heading westward by south. They stopped along the freeway shoulder and filmed since it was now hovering south of the freeway. It moved, they followed. They had the feeling that \"it seemed to try to stay away from us\". It now was moving southeast, lower than the tops of buildings in downtown Santa Ana. They got off the freeway to double back, but it had vanished when they looked for it again. It had only been a minute and they had not actually seen it depart. Their descriptions were poetic. \"Like it went into time travel or like there was a door in the sky and it just went into it.-\" (Earl). \"Like it opened up a cloud and just stepped into it. It was very strange.\" (Pat). Earl's drawing showed three lights on the same lens shape he drew for Wednesday night. Doug's drawing was vsry similar, except for proportions and the red and green lights at the extremities of the shape. Earl said he saw the green at some time during the chase. Analysis This could have been a chase after a slow moving airplane with funny lights (an ad plane?). I estimate the thing covered about 5 miles as the crow flies in the 10 minutes they chased it, from Katella in Orange to downtown Santa Ana. That's 30 mph average, too slow for an ad plane unless it cut back and forth to cover 7 or 8 miles. I do not know of any ad plane that carries such bright lights. A large aircraft's landing lights seen head-on are very bright like spotlights in the sky, but a large plane would have covered the distance to Orange County Airport Oust south of downtown Santa Ana) in a minute or two. Earl was emphatic: \"It wasn't an airplane!\" Pat couldn't say what they were seeing but rather wanted it explained to him. Doug's testimony- appears to support the \"it wasn't an airplane\" theory. The unfortunate part of all this is that the movie film had run out of the camera before Friday night and the boys didn't know it. Since the motor was running on their borrowed Ricoh Super 8, they thought it was getting pictures. I've seen the developed film and it shows airplane landing lights they filmed the evening before from the garage roof. . .\"for comparison if we get a real UFO on film.\" But there it ends. We are left with only the credibility of all the witnesses, which I'd judge as average. The level of excitement seems to rule out fraud, to this investigator, but I cannot rule out a \"folie a deux\" phenomenon. Earl and pat were excited and dominant witnesses, but even so they were acting somewhat dubious about what they were chasing Friday night, insisting that: \"There was no question about Wednesday night, that was for sure!\" So I am left with only a question at this point. Did the UFO come back another night because of all the mental energy and interest directed toward it? Effort beyond the ability of this investigator would be required to run down all the various ad planes and light configurations on aircraft today. But that something strange may have been going on in the Los Angeles basin is evidenced by the story of two ladies who saw something early Thursday morning, on the 28th, just nine hours after the first Orange sighting, but 38 miles away. \"Like big diamonds, jewels, in the sky. Like two big eyes watching us. It was so still and quiet. Like time was standing still.\" So described Freda Kerswill who, with her sister, had just gotten out of their car at the Queen of Angels Hospital, where they work. It was 6:25'AM."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The French Way FLAGRANTE DELICTO IN THE ALFALFA? SACRE BLEU! By Ted Bloecher (Co-Chairman of Humanoid Study Group) Readers of the British weekly, News of the World, may have been titillated by an item in its edition of September 25,1977, in which this CEIII with a special Gallic flavor was briefly described: IT'S A FUNNY OLD WORLD By George Edwards A farmer couldn't believe his eyes when he saw a flying saucer land in broad daylight. \"A man and a woman-both naked-jumped out of the machine,\" he told the police at Tout (sic), France. \"They made love in the field three times then climbed back on the machine and took off. 11 ried to get nearer but a blast threw me off my feet.\" Grinning gendarmes filed the report under \"Unsolved UFO sightings.\" This bit of alleged alien hanky- panky al fresco was immediately passed on by the Humanoid Study Group to its ace French humanoid specialist, Jean-Luc Rivera, to whom we are indebted for having assembled the following information. Zut alors! Something seems to have happened to the translation of the story in its journey across the Channel. Mr. Rivera has provided the probable source for Mr. Edwards' tantalizing little tale. In my own free translation from the French, we find the following story in France Soir, from its edition of July 7, 1977: TWO MARTIAN NUDISTS A native of Dolcourt, near Toul (Meurthe-et- Moselle) had his afternoon nap cut short by the appearance of two Martians. Flabbergasted, he saw a helicopter land in his alfalfa field. A couple got out, dressed in the altogether. \"Adam and Eve\" made three trips around the field and got back into the helicopter, which took off into the air. Convinced that what he had seen was a UFO, the farmer went to the local gendarmes to report his sighting. So, we have Mr. Edwards to thank for turning \"three trips around the field\" in the buff into something a bit more provocative! (The word used in the French account is fours; of course that does rhyme with amours, where in may lie Mr. Edwards' error). And it seems to have been convenient for Mr. Edwards to omit any mention of a helicopter. Ah, but wait, mes amis, there is more! The Paris newspaper's account may be traced back to an even more local representation from the Gironde newspaper, Sud-Quest. In its edition for July 4, 1977, once again with my translation libre, we find the following account: TROUBLED BY MARTIANS It's not every day that one can see Martians got up like Adam and Eve. Last Wednesday (sic) a farmer from Dolcourt (Meurthe-et- Moselle), who was napping underneath a tree, suddenly heard a commotion from a herd of cattle that were stampeding to the far end of the field. Getting up to check, he was \"struck to the ground by a powerful wind from an engi'n\" that descended and landed in the alfalfa field. From it emerged a completely nude pair who very shortly got back into the machine. Convinced that he had seen a UFO, the farmer went off to the local gendarmes to report his strange experience. Now, for the denouement of this reported romp in the alfalfa, we are indebted to the Groupe Prive Ufolo'gique Nanceien, in Nancy. In a letter dated August 15, 1977, from GPUN's secretary, M. Robe, to the Groupe d'Etudes des Sciences d'Avant-Garde, of Bruges, Belgium, we are finally able to discover what rea//y was going on in that field of alfalafa. The letter was reprinted in GESAG's UFO- INFO #49 (September 1977) on page 28. rny own translation of which follows: We have since been able to conduct an inquiry at the scene. The description of a UFO was complete news to the inhabitants of the village, as well as to those of the neighboring village. The witness was not present but we questioned the mayor and several of the residents. The incident took place on June 6, 1977, a helicopter from the National Geographic Institute having landed in a field near the village of Dolcourt, where there was a young lady sunning herself in a bathing surt. Her father, who was working in an adjacent field on his tractor, took notice and drove closer for a better look. At no time did the witness speak of UFOs, nor of Martians. The farmer, M. Flauss, complained to the Gendarmes of Toul simply because of the landing of the machine in his field. The hoax was thus one by the local press, and it is truly a sorry business to have to mix the UFO phenomenon into this incident. . . As the GESAG correspondent, Jean-Luc Proust, so aptly concludes in the UFO-INFO account, \"Here's a fine example of journalistic irresponsibility.\" But the first prize for this special award goes, of course, to News of the World and, especially, George Edwards, who have turned this cunelard de presse into a canard d'esfime. We must doff our chapeaux to Mssrs. Robe and Proust for having set the matter straight. And fast but not least, to M. Rivera, for having brought it to our attention.

Scott Grain, Jr. (Pennsylvania State Section Director for MUFON) The recent disappearance of Frederick Valentich over Bass Strait, Australia last October, has generated a renewed interest in another UFO abduction case that purportedly took place in July 1952. As reported in the Spring 1979 issue 13 of TRUE FLYING SAUCERS & UFOs our protagonist, Fred Reagan, flew his Piper Cub towards a shining lozenge-shaped object and was involved in a mid-air collision. Reagan's plane crashed but he was suspended in the clouds and teleported up into the UFO. After being placed in a dimly-lit room, Reagan was approached by creatures looking like \"huge stalks of metallic asparagus,\" and was told they were sorry their vehicle accidently collided with his, and they were here only to observe our primitive civilization. In reparation for the loss of Reagan's plane, the creatures told him they cured him of cancer, a disease he unknowingly had. The occupants returned Reagan to earth near his crashed plane, warning him not to reveal this experience, for no one would believe him. Normally reports such as this might be considered pure fiction, but because of the recent publicity this incident received in True's spring UFO issue, this researcher felt compelled to set the record straight. To my knowledge, the original article appeared in ACTION magazine, May 1953. It was later reprinted in FLYING SAUCER NEWS June 1963, and finally again in TRUE'S UFO quarterly in 1979. What makes this UFO-abduction case so tantalizing, is a news report which appears to have originated out of Atlanta, Georgia, in May 1953: SAUCER PASSENGER DIES Atlanta—May 16. Fred Reagan, who made headlines lasl year when he claimed he had been a visitor aboard a flying saucer, died today in the State Asylum for the Insane. Cause of death was determined to be degeneration of brain tissue due to extreme 14 atomic radialion. Authorities are unable lo ofter an explanation. Looking at the article and news dispatch at face value, it appears something very mysterious may have erupted here. However, in October 1972, UFO researcher Kurt Giemser .wrote to the Georgia Department of Public Health requesting a copy of the death certificate for Fred Reagan and the fasts surrounding his death. In response, Miss Martha Pattillo, Assistant Director of the Vital Records Unit, wrote back, \"We checked all the spellings of Reagan we could find but were unsuccessful, in locating any record of the death of the person in whom you are interested.\" The alleged newspaper clipping reprinted above appeared in the original article in ACTION, but could not be traced to any newspaper I could find. In conclusion, the story seems to have no substance at all.

The MUFON Humanoid Study Group has located these newspaper references to South American humanoid reports during that period. Translations by Lex Mebane.)

This is the statement on the first page of the reliable and influential \"Jornal do Brasil\", explaining that a railroad worker from the village of Cruzeiros, in the state of Sao Paulo, had a visit from a strange visitor from another planet, while he was quietly fishing on the bank of the Paraiba River. According to the statements gathered by this daily paper, his name was given as Joao de Rio, the railroad worker in question. He talked in Portuguese with a strange little man, about 70 cm tall and with shining eyes, who authorized him to report the fantastic dialogue. It was a little before getting back into his saucer that the midget gave him the piece of metal, which is now being analyzed in the laboratories of the Fabrica Nacional de Vagones, with the purpose of finding out the composition of the strange \"calling card.\" People living in the place assert that Joao de Rio has always been a reliable and trustworthy man."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"UFO TECH NOTE PROJECT VISIT DATA NEEDS DEFINED By John Schuessler Project VISIT (Vehicle Internal Systems Investigative Team) members are seeking consistent, correlative data from abduction cases. Working from the baseline of not trying to prove that a given abduction actually occurred, rather seeking clues from a number of cases, VISIT analysts are busy constructing a technological model of what is happening. An in any scientific endeavor one must be able to replicate the experiment and then seek answers by carefully manipulating variables. To put abduction cases in this context it is necessary to consider a basic set of elements that can be repeatedly addressed. For VISIT purposes, five elements are considered to be important: (1) Baseline data, (2) the witness, (3) the vehicle, (4) humanoids, and (5) post-incident follow-up. Baseline data establishes the basis for comparison of the cases. The VISIT format not only seeks the usual time, place, and weather information, it looks for more subtle elements as well; such as what the witness considers a comfortable environment (i.e., home thermostat setting, humidity level, motor, clock and animal sounds, etc.)- Once a thorough baseline is established other elements can be readily compared from case to case. Witness information covers a broad spectrum, ranging from personal comfort (discomfort), health state, and attitudes, to sensory data and physiological status during the incident. Of particular interest are sounds, odors, paralysis effects, and skin sensations like burning and tingling. Care should be taken during this phase of the investigation so as not to pass over seemingly insignificant facts. Bodily reactions can ultimately be utilized to determine the characteristics of a variety of vehicle systems. Vehicle information should contain the classic eyewitness type data, including perceived size, shape, color, and movement. Equally important is the description of vehicle internal information. The witness can be helpful in this area by calmly explaining what was seen in familiar terms. As an example, a farmer would compare things to farm machinery, an actor to stage settings, and so on. The investigator needs to note and allow for this background and VISIT analysts will factor the conditions into the results. Additional data is needed at this time on lighting, air flow, surface temperatures and textures, and gravity orientations of fixtures. Humanoid descriptions are important because they too can give clues as to the working of the machine. Our own space vehicles are designed to be compatible with astronaut physiology. Along this line the human factors experts have standardized many factors that affect systems design. Utilizing data on humanoid size, shape, strength, and dexterity, a comparison with the human design standards can lead to knowledge about the systems operated by the humanoids. Other factors, such as mouth and nostril size, apparent skin temperature, and body coverings leads to knowledge about humanoid metabolism and what types of life support they require. Unfortunately, the humanoid element is the most fear- provoking to the witness and is therefore least accessible to the conscious mind. The post-incident period for the witness is extremely important to Project VISIT. It is during this part of the case that \"proofs\" can be gained. VISIT experts advise that the witness seek immediate medical assistance from his/her personal physician. Recognizing that medical examinations are expensive VISIT suggests having the witnesses' physician consult with a VISIT expert on what would be most beneficial in the given situation. Because Project VISIT is a specialty group and not a popular membership organization all cases should be handled through one of the major UFO organizations. This can be done by calling headquarters of MUFON (512) 379-9216, CUFOS (312) 491-6666, or APRO (602) 793-1825, who will in turn contact the appropriate VISIT expert to assess the situation and relate what is needed. On the long term the witness should make sure any skin irritation is photographed for the record. Any unusual physiological or psychological developments should be closely monitored and reported. If hypnotic regression, voice stress analysis, or other assistance is needed it should be coordinated through the host investigative group. Project VISIT may be contacted by mail at P.O.

We must wait until it decides to appear, and for the most part its performances are sporadic, short- lived and unpredictable. Therefore, in studying UFOs we must do the next best thing — attempt to correlate those repetitive, similar sightings which seem able to be classified as \"UFO-types.\" Sometimes classification is possible after distressingly long waiting periods. But the result is often worth the wait, for at times the \"result\" is identification of a \"UFO-type\" as a conventional, earth object. Take, for example, the \"exploding lights\" which puzzled Los Angeles researchers during 1974 and 1975. Several cases filtered through SKYNET in which reliable witnesses, often in groups, reported bright yellow lights flying over the San Fernando Valley. While the witnesses watched, the lights \"exploded\" or expanded into great white fireballs which then disappeared without a trace. The following case was typical; it occurred December 20, 1974. Patricia Benson and Eleanor Sawczak were driving west toward Sunland, which is the northern section of the Los Angeles Basin. The time was 11:15 PM. They saw a yellowish-gold, unblinking bright light, approximately five times as bright as a bright star. They temporarily lost sight of it, but at about 11:29 PM while approaching the Benson home caught sight of it, or a similar one, again. It was seen over Mount Wilson, to the north. As they watched, the light suddenly expanded to the approximate size of a full moon. Quoting Mrs. Benson, 16 The color changed from the original yellow- golden color to a very bright white light. I didn't believe my eyes; then a second yellow- golden light appeared, to the left and down from the first light, and it also changed in size and intensity of brightness as the first one. Just as the second one completed its change, a third yellow-golden light appeared to the right and down of the first and went through the same changes as the first and second. As , number three completed its change the first one shrank in size and changed its color to the original size and color. It then disappeared. No movement, it just • disappeared. The second and third disappeared in the same fashion. 1 The entire episode lasted about one minute, leaving the witnesses awed and puzzled. They were not alone. During succeeding months many other San Fernando residents witnessed identical \"exploding\" lights. MUFON investigator Rick Zimmerman and myself made attempts to find a plausible explanation of the phenomenon but met with no success. The objects were certainly not ordinary candle balloons or any similar hoax-type known to us. Then, almost 4 years to the date of the Benson-Sawczak sighting, a small article appeared in the local newspaper. 2 It told of efforts of law enforcement officials to apprehend a hoaxer who had launched two homemade balloons, each about 10 feet high and each trailing a bag containing some type of explosive mixture, directly into the flight path of Orange County Airport, which is situated southeast of Los Angeles. In both cases, when the hoax balloons reached an altitude of 850 feet, the mixture within the bags detonated, causing a fireball 25 to 40 feet in diameter. It seemed probable that this was the same type balloon which had caused the mysterious exploding lights in the San Fernando Valley. Since the lights had not appeared in our area for a couple of years, I assumed our hoaxer had changed his residence to Orange County, and for that we were grateful. We were also glad that the nocturnal \"exploding lights\" had been taken out of the \"unknown\" class. Now, in recent weeks, the San Fernando Valley has a brand-new type of UFO, as represented by the following cases: About 9:00 PM on January 21. 1979, Mrs. Gail Z. and her three children were driving west on the Ventura Freeway near Sherman Oaks. They viewed a big round ball of light, flashing on and off, bouncing up and down, back and forth, and skipping around the sky. The object was white in color, and approximately twenty times the brightness of a headlight on a plane or about % degree angular diameter. As the witnesses watched for six or seven minutes, the object repeatedly blinked out, then reappeared in a different part of the sky, each time traveling 20-30 times its own diameter in about one second. 3 I made attempts to identify the object for the frightened woman, but could not label it as searchlights on clouds, reflections on her windshield, or any other conventional phenomenon. It remained on my charts as an unknown. Then on February 9,1979 at about 6:15 PM another woman witness, traveling west on Ventura Freeway, viewed what seemed to be the same phenomenon. It first appeared as a clump of bright white lights, each many times larger than a bright star. The clump separated in to three or four distinct lights, which blinked on and off, moved up and down jiggled sideways, and then back and forlh m reference to the"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"witness' position. They then began to move almost instantaneously across the sky in great leaps. These leaps were invariably heralded by a blinking off. then a reappearance in another quadrant of the sky. First seen in the north, they leaped to the east, then to the south, then back to the west in front of the witness. The awe experienced by the woman seemed to preclude a simple explanation, such as in the Z. case above. The duration of the sighting, as in the Z. case, was seven minutes. 4 Is this type of report destined to sit in SKYNET report charts and fed into UFOCAT as an unknown? Or will it, too, be eventually identified? Before I suggest a possible, but most tenuous explanation of our dancing Alights, we should mention a daytime sighting which correlates in a surprising manner with the wild nocturnal lights. The report was filtered through SKYNET by police referral to MUFON investigator Morrey Allen. On November 15, 1978, just two months before our nocturnal lights above, Charles and Helen Rambo were walking in a park in Van Nuys, adjacent to Sherman Oaks where Mrs. Z's sighting occurred and also in the same general area as the February 9th occurrence. The wind was 20 knots from the north-northwest, the sky clear and smogless, with a temperature of 62 degrees. The time was 9:35 a.m. Suddenly a dark gray, elliptical object, seemingly solid, 'popped up' suddenly in the east at about 45 degrees elevation. The object faded, then reappeared nearer and to the right of the witnesses, now presenting a round appearance. It vanished again, reappeared farther to the southeast and slightly lower, vanished and appeared again farther to the right. (See Figure A.) All four appearances took place within 1 ^ minutes. The witnesses stated that as it approached nearer it lost its solid appearance and became hazy. The Rambos likened it to a'distant, huge mass of bees or a huge Brillo pad'! 5 The manner in which this daytime object repeatedly vanished, then reappeared in a different part of the sky- seems to correlate with the January 21 and . February 9 sightings of the bouncing, nighttime lights. But how can we correlate the strange \"dark, hazy\" appearance with the bright white nocturnal objects? There is a possible answer which I hesitate to suggest. It is reminiscent of the Air Force's former penchant for identifying UFOs in all manner of strange ways. For instance, we would •not be surprised, if the January 21 and February 9 sightings described here had come over a Project Blue Book desk, to have them identified as \"(possible) birds carrying flashlights\"! The explanation I am going to put forward may sound equally as odd. However, it fits most of the facts of both the daytime and nighttime sightings described above. In a recent DPI newstory 6 Dr. Phillip S. Callahan of the U.S. Agriculture Department suggeted that some nocturnal UFOs could be swarms of glowing insects darting about erratically in a natural electric field. Dr. Callahan reported that insects could trigger electric discharges when flying beneath a storm front. A vast swarm of such insects could set off a highly visible display. The electric field beneath the storm front pulls away electrons from pointed exposed surfaces, such as insect legs and antennae. An avalanche of these electrons would ionize gases in the atmosphere, emitting light. The effect had been created with insects at the Insect Attractants, Behavior and Basic Biology Laboratory. The glowing effects resembled a \"discotheque...in the sky,\" giving off various colors — blue, red, and green. As the insect swarm tries to get out of electric fields they dart around, making a humming sound and suddenly disappear from sight because the swarm would leave the voltage field and the glow would vanish. All of the data reported by our three case witnesses above do not fit Dr. Callahan's theory. The color of the San Fernando Valley darting lights was bright white. However, according to Dr. Callahan, the glowing phenomenon on insects is similar to St. Elmo's fire, which is bluish in hue. Bright bluish light, when seen from a distance, tends to look white. Moreover, the darting, the vanishing and reappearing quality of both the November daytime sighting and the January and February nighttime sightings does fit in splendidly with Dr. Callahan's theory. Also, the hazy appearance which would be presented by a distant swarm of insects fits in exactly with the appearance of the darting November daytime object. Indeed, the witnesses did describe it as looking like a \"vast swarm of bees.\" If it was bees, or insects, it must have been at a great distance, as no sound was heard. Considering the apparent diameter of the Rambo sighting (J£ degree or the diameter of the full moon), it must have been far away to present such a near-solid appearance. Dr. Callahan gives us the information that some insects fly in swarms over 60 miles wide and over 15 miles long. Another vital question: did the January and February nocturnal sightings occur in unstable weafher, since an electrical field such as occurring in a storm front would be necessary to make insects glow? On February 9, 1979, the skies in the San Fernando Valley were partly cloudy. The wind was northerly, heralding the approach of a cold front which was coming down from Northern California. On January 21, 1979, a cold front was actually moving through Southern California. Were these meteorological conditions right for ionization of insect swarms? Not being an expert on these matters, I cannot say. I leave this question to those scientists who might be interested. However, it is rather remarkable that so many of the factual details of the November, January, and February sightings fit the very peculiar, but possible, explanation — insect swarms. So we play the waiting game again, as regards our new Los Angeles \"darting UFO.\" Hopefully, the sightings will continue to repeat until an answer is found. REFERENCES 1.

The most recent entries in all these categories are from 1975, so the book is not up-to-date.

The Guide is indexed by author and by subject, as well as having an index to the directory section. Material from foreign books and periodicals is included in the 3,832 entries.

This was to occur in conjunction with the attempt to resurrect NICAP, however, the negotiations have been discontinued pending positive action by the NICAP Board of Governors to form a viable organization. A good example of the cooperation that may be achieved with such a coalition has been demonstrated during the past 5 years; MUFON volunteered to support Dr. J. Allen Hynek when he organized the Center for UFO studies (CUFOS) in October 1973. Since CUFOS started as a small group of scientists, engineers, and related professions to UFOlogy, MUFON immediately became the nationwide UFO investigative network for UFO sighting reports received on the CUFOS \"hotline\" number from police agencies. In order to provide CUFOS with the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of all MUFON State Directors, State Section Directors, and Consultants for their active file, a copy of each processed membership application is submitted to CUFOS. Dr. Hynek, Mimi Hynek, or Allan Hendry, upon receipt of a \"hotline\" telephone call on a UFO sighting, would refer to their map of MUFON and CUFOS investigators and call the nearest one on their WATTS line. Allan Hendry has been utilizing their WATTS line very extensively to call the witnesses and also to perform peripheral interviews to substantiate the reliability of the report in order to determine if they warrant dispatching an investigator to the scene. Many of the cases may be resolved on the telephone by placing calls to appropriate people to obtain the facts. The high percentage of \"IFO\" reports (90% of those received on the hotline number) has certainly justified the preliminary interviews via the telephone to screen these reports, thus leaving the remaining 10% to be investigated in detail. Your Director heartily cncurs with the recent decision by CUFOS and IUFOR (The International UFO Reporter) that they have spent more than sufficient time on the IFOs to establish a confirmed pattern and should devote the majority of their effort to the 10% that could yield positive information. MUFON has always screened the IFOs at the time and scene of the investigation, to remove the obvious reports so we will not have filing cabmeis 90% filled with reports that do not help to resolve the UFO phenomenon. This obviously requires trained and competent investigators. If the investigator is unable to identify the reported object after a thorough investigation, the completed report will be submitted to MUFON for our file so that our Consultants may have this information for further study where warranted. This does not mean that every effort in our files is a bonafide UFO. If there is any question in the mind of the investigator as to whether the sighting is an IFO or UFO, the report should be filed. Other sighting reports of possibly the same object when correlated could substantiate the questionable report as either UFO or IFO. With so many new state directors, state section directors, and consultants joining MUFON and automatically becoming sources for investigations by CUFOS, it is imperative that we remind everyone of the reporting procedures for UFO investigations originated by CUFOS and assigned to MUFON personnel. Each of us has the dual responsibility of submitting our investigation report to CUFOS and MUFON simultaneously, since this is one of the major features of our cooperative program. Frequently, investigators are filing a report with the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) only, when they have received a request to investigate a report by either Dr. Hynek or Allan Hendry. This is not in compliance with our MUFON Field Investigator's Manual. On page 132 you will note the following paragraph: \"When a call received through UFO Central (CUFOS) merits investigation, a State Director or State Section Director will be notified. All reports resulting from investigations should be first sent to MUFON, with a copy going to the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS).\" The Center for UFO Studies also uses the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual as their investigative guide. Allan Hendry has proposed a UFO Investigator's Guide Book which will be published soon to supplement our F.I.M. for those desiring additional material and techniques where applicable. With the gracious help of Bill and Carol Armstrong, several of the early editions of SKYLOOK have been provided to complete the MUFON file. We have been reproducing copies of SKYLOOK starting with the first issue in September 1967, and forwarding these to George M. Eberhart, MUFON Staff Librarian, at 1615 East 18th St., Lawrence, KS 66044, for his file and to prepare a cross-reference filing index for each year by specific categories. A decision has not been reached on how this reference index will be published for researchers. Watch the Journal for future announcements in this regard. George is to be commended for the professional manner in which he cross- indexed the Journal's for January (continued on page 18)"}]
