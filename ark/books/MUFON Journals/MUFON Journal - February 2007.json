February 2007 Number 466 (Continued on page 22) Directors’ Message By James Carrion James Carrion UFOs and Homeland Security The November 2006 sighting of a UFO over Chicago's O'Hare Airport which recently made headlines across the world reinforces the importance of MUFON’s role in educating the public on the UFO phe- nomenon. Just when we least expect it, the phe- nomenon reap- pears, often times causing witnesses to change their world view and the public to warm up to the radical idea that there may be something after all to UFOs. Who does the public turn to when they seek reassuring an- swers? Not the government, but an or- ganization like MUFON which is ready to lend a sympathetic ear. The reaction of officialdom on the other hand was predictable - \"we see no need to investigate\" - \"probably a weather phenomenon\" - \"it is not of concern\", dismissing the reports of competent airline pilots and ground crew alike. I find it appalling to think that the FAA and the Department of Homeland Security, (entrusted with our nations aviation safety and security), can dismiss a violation of airspace over one of our nation's busiest airports as “not worthy of investigation”. You don't have to believe in the UFO phenomenon to know that this constitutes a major breach of the public's trust. MUFON along with NUFORC and NARCAP are still actively investigating this important case. I want to person- ally thank Peter Davenport of NUFORC and Dick Haines of NARCAP for their early involvement; and Sam Maranto, MUFON Illinois State Director and his dedicated team of field investigators for the many hours they have put into this investigation. As they uncover more in- formation, we will keep you updated as well."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"      3 MUFON UFO Journal February 2007 A Preliminary Overview of the No- vember 7 th , 2006 Sighting of a UFO at O’Hare International Airport If this past January 1 st is any indica- tion as to what to expect in 2007 as far as UFO sightings go, well... hold on to your hat! Well before Jon Hilkevitch, Chicago Tribune’s Transportation Reporter popped the cork to celebrate New Years, he was putting together a new investi- gative piece for his regular column. What made this piece different was that it was about to make the international news in a very big way. “In The Sky ! A bird? A plane A...UFO?” was the title of the story that was being read across Chicago Land. Whether at kitchen tables, ubiq- uitous diners, board rooms or rest rooms, million dollar Gold Coast con- dos or bungalows in Gage Park, it was the buzz about town. Commuters for a change had something intellectually weighted on their laps to read. Though it may not have eased the thought of working a holiday, it was none the less a welcomed break from the usual brain rot in print that is pawned off as news. What an exciting story - United Airlines (UAL) employees observed a disk shaped object hovering over O’Hare In- ternational Airport on November 7 th , 2006 at about 4:30 PM and which then departed at a high rate of speed, leav- ing a gaping hole in the overcast, re- vealing the blue sky above. On January 1st the news wires be- gan to carry this story abroad. Internet, Radio, Television, Cable and nearly ev- ery conceivable form of communica- tion service eagerly propagated this event around the entire globe. In a few days, if not a few hours, what was once a local story had now gained world wide attention and that Chicago Col- umnist was becoming somewhat of a celebrity. Initial Report The story began as a sighting report received by Peter Davenport at NUFORC. It was Peter who asked Mr. Hilkevich to look into this case in hope that Jon would further the investigation and write a serious article on the event. A highly respected investigative jour- nalist in the area of Transportation, Jon did just that and the rest is history. Any object flying within restricted air space at an International Airport with- out radio contact, transponders, or per- mission is potentially an aviation safety issue. It should come as no surprise then that UAL employ- ees and others took the sighting so seri- ously. I personally feel this speaks vol- umes as to their in- tegrity. In the face of ridicule they put their concerns for the safety of others before themselves. Now that’s heroic! Incident at Gate C17 On November 13th, 2006 Peter Davenport who was still settling into the new headquarters for the National UFO Reporting Center and received an urgent report from a United Airlines manager. The manager claimed that he was sitting in his office on November 7 th at 4:30 PM when a radio call came in concerning an ob- ject hovering over gate C17. The man- ager immediately left the office to get a look for himself. There was significant overcast at about 1900 feet but he was able to see the object hovering in place. After making a call to his operation cen- ter to confirm the sighting then contact- ing the FAA, the manager then drove to the concourse to talk to witnesses. One ground crewmember told how he felt compelled for some reason to look straight up and was startled to see the craft hovering silently. This witness then radioed the pilots in the plane (flight 446 from Chicago to Charlotte) that was being pushed back from gate C17. They too observed the object. The object was reported to be metallic and disk shaped and looked like a rotating Frisbee. The next witness to come forward was a UAL pilot who was responsible for taxiing aircraft around the airport. The pilot was maneuvering a 777 from the International Terminal to the UAL Hanger, some 25 minutes away. Look- ing in the direction of the C concourse t he saw the pronounced object just be- low the cloud cover. He described it as a clearly discernible grey disk with at- mospheric distortion around the bottom similar to “heat rising off a desert road”. After parking the aircraft in the hanger he noticed the craft was no longer there but an almost perfect circle in the cloud layer was visible where the craft once was. On December 12 th , 2006 this pilot witness, along with Peter Davenport were interviewed on the Jeff Rense Show, and subsequently the pilot was also interviewed on CNN.Contrary to circulating rumors, the witness stated that UAL had not pressured him in any way to stay quiet, nor had he received Incident at O’Hare By Sam Maranto, MUFON Illinois State Director"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" February 2007 4 MUFON UFO Journal any negative treatment except an occa- sional ribbing from his coworkers.One clarifying statement the pilot made was that “it wasn’t an object, it was a craft”. He also stated that the “inbound ground controller had to have seen it”, although he was quick to point out that the con- trollers may have very strict rules about reporting such things. These are just two of the dozens or more witnesses that witnessed this spectacle. FAA Weather Theory At first the FAA denied receiving any reports of the incident but after being made aware that a Freedom of Infor- mation Act request was filed, they sud- denly remembered. Elizabeth Isham Cory, spokesperson for the FAA, claimed that nothing was observed on radar. “The FAA is not conducting a further investigation”, Cory said. “Our theory on this is that it was a weather phenomenon,” she said. “That night was a perfect atmospheric condition in terms of low ceiling and a lot of airport lights. When the lights shine up into the clouds, sometimes you can see funny things. That’s our take on it” This raises the following questions: How does weather account for a solid object of distinguishable color and shape exhibiting erratic hovering motion which can then bolt though the cloud cover leaving a cookie cutter type hole? How does it account for an object seen from multiple vantage points by multiple witnesses who by virtue of their avia- tion jobs know what should be in that air space and what should not be there? The answer to these questions is that weather conditions can not account for this sighting and the weather explana- tion is just complete and utter nonsense. Media Coverage CLTV in Oakbrook, Illinois was the first to broadcast an interview with Jon Hilkevitch on Friday December 29 th . The follow-up interview was even more re- vealing. It is this nine minutes of live candid footage from the second inter- view that made its way on YouTube.com. This enlightening footage discusses the quality of the witness reports, the pos- sibility of digital photographs, and the genuine and serious interest in this case on the part of the media. In stark contrast, the National Public Radio’s Melissa Block’s interview with Jon Hilkevitch on All Things Consid- ered was both presumptuous about the conduct of UFO organizations and also downplayed Jon’s roll in bringing this case to public awareness. On The Web/In the Blog Use what ever Internet search engine you prefer and type in “ O’Hare UFO”. You will get no less than 400,000 hits. The Chicago Tribune noted that on January 1 st alone this story had more hits than any other in its online history (over one million hits). Another Internet news sites, Cosmic Log at MSNBC.COM by Science Re- porter Alan Boyle had an article featur- ing an interview with both Peter Daven- port and NBC Consultant and UFO Skeptic James Oberg. Mr. Boyle posed the idea that the disk shaped object was a lenticular cloud. However on that day the winds were not strong enough to create these large saucer shaped clouds that are usually seen in the West- ern part of the country on the leeward side of large mountains. In fact, these type of clouds are rarely seen in the Chi- cago area.The very notion of a lenticu- lar cloud below an overcast sky sounds improbable, but even more astounding is how a lenticular cloud could bolt through the cloud layer as witnesses clearly observed. Boyle also puts forth the notion that some sort of weather related vortex may have punctured the clouds creating the circular, near per- fect hole that was seen. However, on that date, the weather conditions were very stable with maximum wind gusts recorded at O’Hare a mere five miles an hour. The other theory proposed was that the hole may have been caused by a Jet going through the cloud cover. This theory also doesn’t make much sense. Jets are aerodynamic and they are de- signed to minimize resistance and drag. They will cause a temporary distur- bance but not one significant enough to leave any such lasting pattern in the clouds. The time of the event was 4:30 PM central time and although there was an overcast, it was still daylight. Skeptical Noise James Oberg also made a statement regarding the reliability of Airline Pilots as witnesses. “NTSB investigators say that the worst observers of an aviation accident are aviation personnel” Oberg said. “Its because pilots will usually want to understand what’s happened, and in their initial perceptions and latter retellings will stress the facts that sup- port their interpretation.” This statement sounds more like the the tactics used by Skeptics rather than pilots. If pilots are not able to make valid real time vi- sual observations of shapes, color and motion in the sky, then they cannot be trusted with the safety of airline pas- sengers. Real time observations and analysis are constant critical functions performed routinely by pilots. No one does this better... period! We’re not talking about recall analysis but real time analysis. Mr. Oberg’s statement can be considered questionable at best. Calling all Ufologists In no time at all, UFO experts, skep- tics, and witnesses alike were in high media demand. Interviews and press conferences now dotted the calendars of anyone willing to answer the call. On January 3 rd , Richard Dolan, author of “UFOs and the National Security State” was interviewed along with Jon Hilkevitch on CNN. Peter Davenport was also interviewed numerous times. Yours truly also had his share of inter- views and will soon be in Chicago Magazine. Where are the Photos? With the hundreds of security cam- eras, numerous Transportation Safety Agency (TSA) employees, Air Traffic Controllers and others in the airport towers, not to mention the hundreds of airport visitors and passengers, you would think someone would have pho- tographed or video taped the object. Will we see them? Hopefully."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"      5 MUFON UFO Journal February 2007 The Investigation Begins At the request of Peter Davenport, Dr. Richard Haines, Director of NARCAP started the investigation. Dr. Haines has many years of experience in dealing with pilots and the aviation in- dustry on the subject of UFOs. Dr. Haines reputation for honoring witness anonymity (especially for pilots whose livelihood depends on it) is truly com- mendable. Illinois MUFON and the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) will be assisting Dr. Haines in the field as needed. Freedom of information request have been filed by Dr. Haines and Jon Hilkevitch. They have not yet received any responses to these FOIA requests. At this time it is premature to make any more statements as to the progress of this investigation other than to say it is ongoing and there is much to do. A fi- nal report will be published on comple- tion. To provide some historical back- ground, a UFO was also reported by tower personnel at O’Hare Airport on June 29th, 1951 and made it into Project Blue Book’s case reports. There have also been other reports of UFO activ- ity around Chicago airports and one such case at O’Hare in 2001 was re- ported to CUFOS and passed on to me for investigation. The event took place at about 2:30 AM central time and was observed by four UAL employees who were on lunch break. The craft was so close and large that the main witness said “It was maybe only fifty feet away and about seventy five feet in the air. Making no sound whatsoever. It had to be over a hundred feet long and I was so close to it I could see it entirely.” The witness said that he viewed it for 28 seconds as it slowly floated in front of him and then it banked up over a runway into the mist/fog that was per- sistent that night and took off at a fast rate of speed. “It had very bright yellow lights com- ing out of elongated windows or slots equally spaced along the bottom “ said the witness. This witness is in the pro- cess of locating fellow witnesses to get their perspective on the event. I will be writing a follow up on this case and other related cases in Illinois. Editor’s Notes: After being notified of the sighting Dick Haines of NARCAP immediately: 1) Filed an FOIA with the FAA for relevant tower communications, radar tapes, etc. 2) Completed a full meteo- rological review. 3) Spoke with a num- ber of witnessed 4) Obtained detailed airport facility measurements with which to calculate distances and visual angles. 5) Contacted personnel at the Aviation Safety Reporting (ASRS) office. 6) Identified the aircraft at gate C-17 (but has not yet been able to identify its crewmembers that allegedly also saw the UFO hovering overhead). Jon Nowinski, Director of the Smok- ing Gun Research Agency (SGRA) spoke on January 8, 2007 with the Pub- lic Affairs Officer at Scott AFB in Illi- nois as well as the Media Relations Of- ficer at NORAD, located at Peterson AFB in Colorado. The PAO at Scott AFB stated that while they were aware of the sighting, the base was never contacted by O’Hare Air Traffic Control. He further stated that there were no aircraft from Scott in the air at the time of the reported sighting, nor did Scott ATC report any contacts by radar in the airspace around the base or the city of Chicago. He was not aware of any instances where aircraft from Scott were scrambled to intercept or in- vestigate any unidentified objects in the area, but could not say for certain it had never happened. The MRO at NORAD said that they too were aware of the sighting but em- phasized that they only knew what they heard through the media or by other out- side sources.

Twichell Michigan MUFON’s Chief Investiga- tor, Lisa Shiel was assigned the case of a UFO sighting that occurred on August 16, 2006 at 9:43 PM. She then passed it onto State Section Director, Gary Golem and then I for further investigation. S. W., the witness, observed a typical disk- shaped object in the night sky for about eight minutes before it departed and was able to take at least one excellent pic- ture of it. Below is the picture (un- touched) and her report to MUFON. S.W .: “I was driving home after hav- ing been to a circus in the town of Ply- mouth, Michigan. I was crossing a rail road track near my home while looking to be sure the tracks were clear, I no- ticed it to my right hovering above the tracks in the distance. I decided to see what it was, so I drove towards it hop- ing to get a better look at it while calling my sister to tell her what I was seeing. I had taken my camera with me to the cir- cus, so I grabbed it and started taking pictures, the sky was very dark and I at first couldn’t get it to show up (although the object itself was illuminated).I stopped in a parking lot where I had a clear view, there were no sounds com- ing from it at all. I continued to take pictures while talking to my sister. I Blimp or UFO? looked at my camera to try and change the settings and when I looked back it was moving away from where I had been watching it. I got in my truck and started following it. As I was driving down Plymouth Rd., I keep wondering why no one else was stopping to see it. I was very alarmed yet curious and somewhat scared at what I was seeing. As I came around a bend in the road I saw airplanes, approximately 4-5, and also a helicopter. I noticed that it had stopped again and was hovering just above the treetops. I couldn’t get over the enormous size of it. It appeared to be at least the size of a house. All the while I was taking pictures, hoping to get at least one good picture while talk- ing to my sister, who I had put on speakerphone. Then I heard the helicop- ter and I looked to my right to see it. When I looked back to my left where the object had been hovering, it was no longer there. I was very nervous and excited the entire time. I gave my sister a play-by-play as the events unfolded. She kept asking me exactly where I was just in case something was to happen. The object appeared to be translucent and very, very bright. The entire thing lasted about ten minutes, although it seemed a lot longer. I watched the local news that night and checked the news- papers and was very shocked to see no mention of it. I can’t believe that I Mr. Twichell is a field investi- gator, newsletter editor and Public Relations Officer for Michigan MUFON. He has authored three books as well as numerous ar- ticles on the UFO phenomenon. He has been a guest on numerous media shows as well as hosting his own lo- cal TV show, entitled “We Are Not Alone”, which is presently in its sev- enth year. Most recently, he began broadcasting the radio version of his TV show on WHFR 89.3 FM. It may be heard the first Saturday of each month on the World Wide Web at 10:00 AM (EST) by going to http:// whfr .fm/index.php. He presently re- sides with his wife in Trenton, Michi- gan. Most of his time is devoted to writing about and lecturing on UFOs and related phenomena. was the only who saw this.” Gary Golem asked the witness in a telephone interview how high the ob- ject was. She stated that the object was approximately 6-8 poles in height over the tracks. She also stated that she be- lieved the object to have headed in a Southeasterly direction. The event aroused the interest of the witness’ sister, L.W., who a couple days later, scoured the Internet for similar sightings in that area around the same time that evening. She found three and immediately alerted her sister. A twenty- four year old man, traveling with two other witnesses observed a similar ob- ject while traveling from downtown Detroit to Southgate, Michigan along the Detroit River. Witness 2 : “Approximately 10:35 PM (August 16, 2006) my mother, sister and I left the Joe Louis Arena parking ga- rage in downtown Detroit and headed south on Fort Street towards the ‘downriver’ area. We spotted an object over the Detroit River that resembled a blimp but it was glowing with a bright"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"      7 MUFON UFO Journal February 2007 light and was keeping the same pace as us (about 45 MPH). We continued down Fort Street keeping sight of the object for about 20 minutes. We lost sight of the object for about 10 minutes while stopped at my parent’s house. When I got back on the road and headed towards my house, I spotted the object above me in the area of Dix and Northline. The object was glowing with a bright almost white light and a small blinking red light was in the bottom cen- ter of the object. It was rounded on top and flat on the bottom. It was moving at a pretty fast speed. It continued to move around in this area for another half hour before I lost sight of it. There was a man in the car next to me who was looking up at it also, so I am certain other people saw it. I tried to take a picture with my digital camera but because it was so dark they didn’t come out very well. I checked around with people the next couple days but no one else saw anything but the roads were pretty light with traffic be- ing 11 at night on a Wednesday. How- ever, a few days later a co-worker said she saw a report on channel 4 news that a man reported strange activity in the sky on Wednesday the 16th. (This would have been the Thursday the 17th 11 P.M. news) I could not find any re- ports on their website and came across this website by searching Google for UFO sightings in Detroit. It was defi- nitely not a natural object. I highly doubt it was a blimp due to the bright light and speed of the object. I would think a satellite would have been higher but I have never seen a weather balloon so I have no explanation for the strange ob- ject. I really never thought much about UFO sightings until now. I wish I could find an explanation for this but I’m glad I came across this website and found other proof that someone else saw the object.” At 10:30 PM, two witnesses in Windsor, Ontario, Canada reported a similar object for less than five minutes. Witness 3: “My friend and I had de- cided to drive towards the Detroit River when we noticed a huge bright saucer- like object in the sky. At first we thought it was a blimp but at 10:30 on Tuesday in the suburb, rich part of Windsor that seemed very unlikely. It was shaped too circular to be a blimp and was very flourescent with blinking lights. We drove up an overpass and could still see the figure. We continued to drive to the river (about 2 minutes) and turned back around to find it again but it had disappeared. We drove around for an- other 15 minutes or so and still couldn’t find it in the sky. Very scary.”The wit- ness also reported his sighting to local TV and newspapers. In a separate report from Windsor to ufoevidence.com, four people witnessed the same or similar object. Witness 4: “It was around 10.30 PM when my husband went to the windows to close the blinds for the night. He spot- ted a well-lit flying object and woke me up to show it. It was not an airplane shaped object, but something of a dif- ferent shape, sometimes looked octago- nal, sometimes like a huge saucer, well- lit, luminous object, moving not too fast but occasionally lost from view as they were passing tall trees. We could fol- low it for at least 15 minutes from our living room. It was a huge object, very exciting and scary at the same time. I have heard and read about UFOs. But never seen one or believed in one. But yesterday I sure believed what I saw. I was convinced it was something un- usual, extraordinary and unnatural.” I asked ufoevidence.com for the con- tact information of the Canadian wit- nesses or to have my email address for- warded to them. There has been no re- sponse, therefore further investigation of the Downriver and Canadian wit- nesses has stalled at this time. Longtime MUFON photographic analyst, Dr. Bruce Maccabee was sent a copy of the photograph taken by S. W. to which he replied, “Since I know nothing about this sighting, except that the photo looks real from previous ex- perience and the shape, I would sug- gest checking on the possibility of an internally lighted blimp... unless there is something about the sighting that posi- tively rules out such a blimp.” Erring on the side of caution, Dr. Maccabee did not rule out the possibil- ity of a blimp while verifying that the object appeared to be an authentic ‘un- known’ based on the shape and his pre- vious extensive experience. Mr. Golem checked with the Mettetal Airport in Canton (the closest small air- port near Plymouth MI) and spoke with the airport manager regarding the night of August 16. He was told that nothing was reported or anything special hap- pened that night. Nor were there any flights that he was aware of out of that facility. Golem also called the Helicop- ter service at Mettetal airport. The heli- copter service had no flights that night either. I personally called a Caryn Johnson at the Gross Isle Airport where adver- tising blimps are normally moored for special events in the Detroit metropoli- tan area. Ms. Johnson referred me to Amy Caulder of the Lightship Group that dispatches the blimps to the area from Madison, Wisconsin. I sent the photo- graph of the Plymouth object for her in- spection via email. Amy replied: “Hello there David, To me it clearly looks like the SANYO blimp. I am attaching a daytime photo of the ship so you can compare the letter- ing on the sides of each picture. We have an internal light system so the ship ap- pears to glow from within while flying at night. Hope this helps. Thanks, Amy” I sat for some time trying to “see the lettering on the sides of each picture” without success. I sent Ms. Caulder’s email along with both pictures to Ms. Johnson at the Grosse Isle Airport to see if she could see something that I was missing. She replied: “Thanks for sending the pictures from the woman in Plymouth and from Sanyo. I can see how you don’t see the resemblance that she says is there — it is a stretch! Was Amy able to confirm if they were in this area on August 16, 2006?” Daytime picture of the Sanyo blimp"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" February 2007 8 MUFON UFO Journal Once again, I wrote to Amy Caulder and asked: 1. Does the SANYO blimp have a large red light on the tail section? 2. Are they allowed to (or do they ever) fly with the internal light system off and the advertisement not dis- played? the object but no gondola on the bot- tom. Nor does this picture emphasize any lettering on the side of the object that would be blatantly apparent if they existed. ported that the object was directly above him at one point and it was “rounded on top and flat on the bottom”, and “moving at a pretty fast speed”, both of which are inconsistent with a blimp. The Windsor witnesses considered the possibility of a blimp but concluded that “It was shaped too circular to be a blimp”. The Plymouth sighting is another matter. According to Amy Caulder of the North America Group that dis- patched the blimp, “unless it diverted from its known course, it moved east- ward along I-94, which would have taken it over the Romulus area”. Ply- mouth is sixteen miles due north of Romulus (as the blimp flies) from the I-94 and I-275 intersection. S. W., the witness in Plymouth, stated that the object headed off in a South- easterly direction. The Detroit/Windsor area is indeed southeast of Plymouth where witnesses reported their sighting a half hour to forty-five minutes later. Advertising blimps generally fly over events where throngs of people congre- gate. Would a circus in Plymouth, Michi- gan qualify? Would airplanes and heli- copters be part of the show? Why would the helicopters approach the blimp? And why would the blimp depart the scene when approached by them? Why couldn’t S. W. finally conclude that it was a blimp when she had sev- eral minutes to observe it? The most baffling question is the photographic evi- dence captured by the Plymouth witness. Until someone with computer software and an expertise better than mine can confirm otherwise, the Plymouth object remains an unknown. Nighttime picture of Sanyo blimp 3. Was the SANYO blimp moored at the Grosse Isle Airport or flying in that area on the evening of Aug. 16, 2006? Amy replied: “Hello David, Let’s see what I can help you with here. Yes we do have a red light on the tail. Yes we do fly with the lights off, however the SANYO lettering is a decal that can not be taken on and off quickly so no, we never fly without that. However there are plain white blimps with no advertise- ments on them at all. Lastly we do use Grosse Isle quite often.

Un- like the Sanyo blimp, the glowing edge lines clearly depict a copula on top of Computer enhanced photo Another experiment using ‘emboss’, which emphasizes the lines in a photo- graph, did not reveal lettering. It did, however, emphasize the existence of a copula on top and lack of a gondola on the bottom. Furthermore, the overall shape, lighting configuration, and lack of bright internal lighting does not sug- gest to me that the Plymouth object and the Sanyo blimp are one and the same. Computer enhanced photo The fact that the Sanyo blimp was in the area of downtown Detroit and tra- versed along the Detroit River on the evening of August 16, 2006 could eas- ily account for the sighting reports from the Downriver/Windsor area. It is re- grettable that those witnesses could not be contacted for further testimony. The fact that these witnesses are un- able to tell the difference between an advertising blimp and an unknown ob- ject is troubling. It may be that the blimp was too far away and moving toward or away from them, disallowing them to view the lettering on its side. All of the witnesses involved reported that the object was very bright. I have seen the Sanyo blimp personally and can verify that it is indeed very bright.

Although this may seem like a Cryptozoology case, sightings of strange animals are also often reported during UFO encounters. Recently two strange animals were killed in Arkansas. MUFON Arkansas is investigating and Arkansas State Di- rector Norm Walker filed the following report with MUFON HQ: The first animal shot in October 2006. The second animal shot in Decem- ber 2006. Norm Walker (left) and Ken Bergeron (right) down to the field where he shot the animal and Casper and Matt followed us to the site. On the way, Mr. Mullins told me that he would normally shoot 4-5 coyotes every year to protect his herd of cattle. This animal had behaved somewhat differently. As we reached the site of the carcass, he mentioned that the buzzards had worked the car- cass over, but it was still there in the field. As we were shooting pictures, Mr. Mullins mentioned that the teeth were different than that of a coyote and the tail was more bushy at the end. After several pictures were taken, Matt agreed to take the carcass and refrigerate it, in case we needed it for DNA testing. We left just as it was getting dark. MUFON Consultant in Veterinary Science, Lawrence Lacey was asked to look at the pictures of the two dead ani- On Jan 3, 2007, Assistant State Di- rector and lead investigator Ken (Casper) Bergeron and I traveled to Clarksville, Arkansas to meet with Matt McCormick at his One Stop store. We (along with Randy Collins, Field Inves- tigator Trainee) had interviewed Matt on November 21, 2006 after a local TV sta- tion (5News) reported that a strange ani- mal had been shot by a hunter on Oc- tober 3, 2006. Matt was given pictures of the first animal to display in his store and it was Matt who initially contacted 5News. The body of the first animal was buried in an undisclosed location by the hunter who shot it. This time a farmer, Herla Mullins had shot another animal December 7, 2006 in his field after it continued to stalk his cattle. We trav- elled 10 miles back in the hills to reach Mr. Mullin’s farm. Casper and I fol- lowed Matt in his truck along some winding country roads to the farm. We reached the farm at 4:00 P.M. and I rode with Mr. Mullins in his farm truck mals. Lacey concluded: “After study- ing the pictures, I conclude that what- ever this cryptozoological specimen is, it is not a dog. I see some similarities to the wallaby, such as the size, large erect ears, short wooly fur, long tail, small forequarters, and better developed rear quarters. Are any of the specimens female and do they have the kangaroo belly pouch? The hopping gait also leads one to compare it with the family of small kangaroos. A definite dissimi- larity to the wallaby is the dog-like den- tition. Wallabies are vegetarians. “In order to conclude anything from the bones, one would have to have ac- curate measurements to compare front and rear of this thing with front and rear of a similar sized dog. I sent the two pictures to a friend of mine, Ken Roach, a retired long time leading small animal practitioner here in Sioux City.

When Dr. J. Allen Hynek issued his infamous ‘swamp gas’ explanation for the 1966 mass sightings in Michigan, then Congressman Ford came to the aid of the American Public by stating in a letter to the House Armed Services committee and the House Science and Astronautics Committee: In the firm be- lief that the American public deserves a better explanation than that thus far given by the Air Force, I strongly rec- ommend that there be a committee in- vestigation of the UFO phenomena. I think we owe it to the people to estab- lish credibility regarding UFOs and to produce the greatest possible enlight- enment of the subject. I have taken spe- cial interest in these (UFO) accounts because many of the latest reported sightings have been made in my home state of Michigan... Because I think there may be substance to some of these re- ports and because I believe The Ameri- can people are entitled to a more thor- ough explanation than has been given them by the Air force to date, I am pro- posing either the Science and Astronau- tics Committee or the Armed services Committee of the House, schedule hear- ings on the subject of UFOs and invite testimony from both the executive branch of the Government and some of the persons who claim to have seen UFOs... In the firm belief that the Ameri- can public deserves a better explana- tion than that thus far given by the Air Force, I strongly recommend that there be a committee investigation of the UFO phenomena. I think we owe it to the people to establish credibility regard- ing UFOs and to produce the greatest possible enlightenment on this subject.” Neither committee took action on Congressman Ford’s recommendations although Congressional hearings on UFOs were held in 1968. Ufology owes a debt of gratitude to President Ford for taking a public stance on behalf of the American public in the face of Air Force debunking and ridicule.

Jacques Arnould, an official at the Na- tional Space Studies Center (CNES), said the French database of around 1,600 incidents would go live in late January or mid-February. He said the CNES had been collect- ing statements and documents for al- most 30 years to archive and study them. “Often they are made to the Gendarmerie, which provides an offi- cial witness statement ... and some come from airline pilots,” he said by tele- phone. Given the success of films about visitations from outer space like “E.T.”, “Close Encounters of The Third Kind” and “Independence Day”, the CNES archive is likely to prove a hit. It con- sists of around 6,000 reports, many re- lating to the same incident, filed by the public and airline professionals. Their names would not be published to pro- tect their privacy, Arnould said.

The object which measured just 3 1/2 inches long and more than three- quarters of a pound fell through the roof of a home in Freehold, New Jer- sey and embedded itself in a wall. “It pierced the shingles, the roof sheathing, the roof insulation, and the sheet rock of the bathroom. It damaged the tile floor and embedded itself into the sheet rock of the side wall of the bathroom,” said lieutenant Robert Brightman of the Freehold Township Police Department. “There’s some great interest in what we have here, It’s rather unusual. I haven’t seen anything like it in my career,” he added. Approximately 20 to 50 rock-like objects fall every day over the entire planet, said Carlton Pryor, a professor of astronomy at Rutgers University. “Its new owners (a married couple with a son) expressed some interest in putting the meteorite on a small-scale tour so local schoolchildren could see it”, said Jeremy Delaney, a Rutgers Uni- versity meteoriticist who was among four scientists who identified the ob- ject for police. Eventually the family will have to decide whether to keep the me- teorite, give it to an academic institu- tion such as a museum, or sell it to a collector. New Jersey’s only other known meteorite, weighing an ounce, fell in Deal in 1829.

As reported in the Colorado Springs Gazette, a Mrs. C. O. Seleen, first saw the mysterious light on Sun- day, February 17, 1929. Mrs. Seleen “stated that the light appeared to be on the right of the summit house and lasted from 9 until 9:30 Sunday night. She declared the illumination was similar to the fireworks display at the Adaman Club on New Years Eve.” A Manitou Springs dairyman, S.R. Francisco, first thought the light to be from workers on the Cog Rail- way. After watching it on successive nights, he decided it was “an unusually bright star.” The lights were also wit- nessed at about 8:45 PM on Wednes- day, February 20 th by a Mrs. T.K. Finseth, who “declared that they re- semble a bonfire.” This was also the conclusion of a Colorado College night watchman who had been studying the mystery light. Several other witnesses agreed.The Gazette all but discounted the idea of a signal fire from someone in distress, since “no hiker is known to have attempted to scale the mountain.” On Friday the 22 nd , the Gazette later reported, a search plane “carrying blankets, chocolate and matches, “ crossed over the wind-blown summit... without sighting any signs of life or “fire and... returned confident that whatever their source, the mysterious lights were not of human origin. The flight did have a thrilling end, however, when the en- gine developed altitude sickness the pi- lot was forced to make a ‘dead-stick landing’ at the Alexander Airport, some ten-thousand feet lower and 15 miles distant. That same day, Nat Walker, a student at Colorado College, climbed Pikes Peak but saw no evidence of fire. He also noted, after crawling through a summit house window, that the register’s last entry was made by the Adaman Club on New Year’s Eve. However, it defies logic that someone wishing to remain unknown would sign in. Despite the various search mis- sions, the ghost light reappeared near the summit at 9:05 that evening. It shone for five minutes then disappeared for five minutes, only to reappear not more than 50 feet north of its former spot. Since previous explanations couldn’t account for the light’s eccen- tricities, it was only natural that less- grounded theories took flight. Among these: The ghost of a miner – carrying a lantern; the Moon’s reflection off the summit house windows; and ultimately nature’s proof of Einstein’s theory of relativity. According to the Gazette , Einstein’s theory came into play when the light was observed in different places by different people: Does light travel in a straight line? Is Pikes Peak showing that it does not? Good luck arguing that one with some early 20 th century Physics devotee. Even the Adaman Club’s Fred Morath apparently feeling the heat, con- ceded the possibility that their fireworks may be the cause. By coincidence, stormy weather had forced cancellation of that year’s display, so the boxes had been cached on the summit. In fact, a Denver Post article from January 1, 1925 describes the prelude to the pre- vious evening’s display as blazing “sig- nal lights,” followed later by “occasional specks of light.” But the Gazette dashed water on this theory offering “If this were true, then some maniac has been defying ter- rific cold and much suffering to fire off at fitful intervals, one at a time, some of the Adaman flares”. Nonetheless, the news writer was probably closer to de- scribing the average mountain climber’s mental state than he realized. Perhaps the final ingredient of the Pikes Peak ghost Lights, or UFOs, is an official explanation from Washington. In March 1929, Charles Fitzhugh Talman, the United States Weather Bureau Librarian “and well- known authority on meteorology, pub- lished an article in Science Service, claiming the Pikes Peak lights were a naturally-occurring electrical discharge “known as ‘St. Elmo’s Fire’.” Talman cites an 1876 journal kept by the peak’s Signal Corps weather observers, who “were often treated to spectacular displays.” On at least one occasion, electrical discharges outlined almost 700 feet of telegraph wire “in brilliant light which was thrown out in beautiful scintillations. Not only was the wire outlined in this manner, but every exposed metallic point and surface was similarly tipped or covered. The an- emometer cups appeared as four balls of fire revolving slowly around a com- mon center. There was no heat in the light, and when the wire was touched only the slightest tingling sensation was felt.” Thus explained, the Pikes Peak Ghost Lights did not rematerialize. Or maybe they just moved north. On November 21, 1941, the af- ternoon edition of the Denver Post re- ported that “light signals, apparently an ‘SOS’ flashed by means of a mirror, were seen coming from Mount Evans Friday morning.” Since snow had closed the road above Echo Lake sev- eral weeks before, speculation began that a skier had become stranded. Denver’s Manager of Parks George Cranmer said, “the peak is too rugged to attract ski enthusiasts.” He also pointed out that, “the big glass bay win- dow of the summit house looks to the east and possibly had reflected the sun.” To aid in searching for the light source, the Chamberlin Observatory at Denver University trained its telescope on the peak, some 30 miles distant. Not to be excluded, several state and fed- eral officials with office windows pro- viding an unobstructed view of the peak tried without success to see anything.” Lowry Field also stationed a man in the fire lookout tower to scan the mountain with powerful field glasses. Officials said an observation plane would fly to the peak if the lookout reported any- thing to justify making a special mis- sion flight.The next morning, the Rocky"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" February 2007 12 MUFON UFO Journal Feb. 25-March 2, 2007 –Interna- tional UFO Congress Conference & Film Festival, Laughlin, NV, 303-651- 7136, www.ufocongress.com.

Mountain News reported that the watchers “were unable to detect any- thing unusual,” and that “nothing was seen to indicate the source of the flashes.” City officials expressed belief that a window or some shiny object on the ground may have reflected the sun.” This is not the only occasion of mysterious lights on Mount Evans. In the summer of 2005, unusually bright lights were witnessed, and videotaped on the mountain’s upper reaches. These individual lights most often appeared at dusk on the northern and southern shoulders of Mount Evans above tim- berline, but also on the summit. They would shine brightly for several seconds to a minute, and then disappear. On several occasions movement was ob- served. Since they often appeared near the toll road, it could be argued that these were merely car headlights, how- ever, these ghost lights performed some decidedly spooky maneuvers. On August 8, 2005 at 8:30 PM, a single yellow-white light appeared on the southern flank of Mount Evans near its 13,000-foot saddle with Epaulet Mountain. After a few flickering sec- onds, the light split. The first light re- mained stationary, while the second light moved slowly northward. Within sec- onds the first light disappeared, fol- lowed quickly by the second light. Eight minutes later, another light was observed on the northern flanks of Mount Evans, just below Rogers Peak (13,391). This light turned variously yellow, red, or- ange and white before it also split, as if giving birth to a second ball of light which quickly vanished. Moments later the first light also dimmed from view. On other occasions, a previ- ously unseen light on the summit was seen to blink once, followed immedi- ately by a single blink from its north shoulder counterpart. Then nothing. Is this a signal of some kind? Or the planet Venus with a friend? Or is it swamp gas reflected by Elvis? What could be the explanation behind these mysterious mountain lights? Are the sightings of 1929, 1941 and 2005 somehow con- nected? We await the official govern- ment cover story. Until then... the truth is up there.

UFO Crashes in Iran TEHRAN (Fars News Agency) -- An Unidentified Flying Object crashed in Barez Mounts in the central province of Kerman on Wednesday morning January 10, 2007. Deputy Governor General of Kerman province Abulghassem Nasrollahi told FNA that the crash which was followed by an explosion and a thick spiral of smoke has caused no casualties or damage to properties. He further denied earlier re- ports that the explosion has been the result of a plane or chopper crash, re- minding that all the passing aircraft have been reported as sound and safe. The crash site is several hundred miles from even the closest nuclear development site and is not likely to be a foreign drone. The official further stated that investigations are underway by police and other relevant authorities in this re- gard. Eye-witnesses assure that the explo- sion has been caused as a result of the crash of a radiant unidentified flying object onto the ground. Meantime, an informed source told FNA that the ob- ject has been on fire and there has been thick smoke coming out of it prior to the crash, concluding that the object couldn't have been a meteor as mete- ors do not smoke. The source also said that the crash has been witnessed by people in several cities and the crash site is located 100 kilometers from the provincial capital city of Kerman. Similar crash incidents have been witnessed frequently during the last year all across Iran, and officials believe that the objects could be spy planes or a high-tech espionage device. The city of Rafsanjan reported a similar incident several days ago. Thanks to FNA. Filer Comments: There is some question if the reported UFOs are in fact US surveillance drones. Iranian Air Force General Karim Hawami stated, \"We drew up plans to protect our nuclear facilities from any threat. The Iranian Air Force is on its guard and ready to do its duty.\" Ground to air missiles have been moved into to protect the nuclear develop- ment sites. They have been given the order to shoot down any unidentified or suspicious object that enters Iranian air space. The US has been fly- ing surveillance drones over Iran to seek evi- dence of their nuclear weapons program and to detect weaknesses in Ira- nian air defenses. The small, pilotless planes, penetrating Iranian air- space from U.S. military facilities in Iraq, use radar, video, still photography and air filters designed to pick up traces of nuclear activity to gather information that is not accessible by satellites. The aerial espionage is stan- dard in military preparations for an eventual air attack and is also employed as a tool for intimidation. U.S. officials confirmed that the drones were de- ployed along Iran's northern and west- ern borders, starting in April 2003, and periodically since then. The U.S. intel- ligence community began using Iraq as a base to spy on Iran shortly after tak- ing Baghdad in early April 2003. Ira- nian special forces entered Iraq and conducting intelligence and terrorist operations. The UFOs were first spotted by doz- ens of Iranian civilians and set off a na- tional newspaper frenzy over whether the country was being visited by UFOs or surveillance drones. In one sense the US and Iran are already at war. Iranian intelligence units are operating inside Iraq and have been supplying high ex- plosives for terrorist operations inside the country. Several different types of drones with varying capabilities have been deployed over Iran. Some fly several hundred feet above the earth, getting a closer view of ground activities than satellites, and are equipped with air filter technology that captures particles and delivers them back to base for analysis. Any presence of plutonium, uranium or tritium could indicate nuclear work in the area where the samples were collected. Iran's Na- tional Security Council indicated \"It is clear to the Iranian Air Force many whom were trained in the US, that the intention was to get Iran to turn on our radars,\" the official said. This is a tac- tic, designed to determine the locations, frequencies they are operating on, ranges, and capability of Iranian Air Defense System. Iran's national secu- rity officials ordered their forces not to turn on the radar or come into contact with the drones in any way."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"      15 MUFON UFO Journal February 2007 Tennessee White Light I was letting my cat out January 15, 2007, and since its still unseasonably warm 54 degrees, I decided to step out- side with my cup of coffee. It was about 5:30 AM, and I was looking north at the relative fast moving clouds. I saw a very bright object not blinking, brighter than a plane but it did not illuminate the sky. It was a white light one. It was moving much faster than any jet I have ever seen. Although it was the size of a plane traveling at a normal altitude it moved faster than anything I have ever seen. It moved west to east and if I ex- tended my arm the object could be cov- ered with my thumb but traveled the dis- tance of a yardstick if held in my hand. I noticed that it traveled in between clouds. Maybe it was a shooting star but I don't know. The brightness and the speed made this unlike anything I have ever seen. Thanks to MUFON CMS www.mufon.com Virginia Light Toms Brook -- While traveling in a van on I-81 South near Toms Brook, Virginia, at 6:57 PM, on December 11, 2006, my attention was diverted upward and to the left while glancing out the driver's window as I passed Mile Post 288.5. A bright yellow-white light sat motionless in the very clear night sky among the fixed stars for about a half- minute or more. I detected no change in its position relative to the stars de- spite my highway speed of approxi- mately 65-70 mph. This indicated to me that the light was probably hovering at an altitude well above 50,000 feet--- far away from me. Perhaps 100 to 200 thousand feet altitude. The object was due south toward Charlottesville (ap- proximately 60 miles away). The object appeared ahead of me about 50 degrees to my left and 30 de- grees above the horizon (90 degrees being directly overhead). It was almost as bright as Venus but with a distinct yellow tint. After about 15 to 20 sec- onds of observing, I saw it dim down dramatically to approximately one-third of its original brightness, hold for sev- eral seconds, dim down to a mere ‘cin- der’, hold for a few more seconds, then dim steadily until it went completely out. I had the distinct impression the dim- ming was controlled manually. I no- ticed two aircraft in formation at ap- proximately 30,000 feet flying right through that part of the sky only three minutes later. I stopped at the next ramp and exited my vehicle. An unusually high number of aircraft flew across the area 10 minutes after the sighting and continued to crowd the sky for at least half an hour. At a random moment, I counted 15 aircraft in various directions. The light appeared very bright to be so far away. I estimate that if it was hov- ering only a few thousand feet high, it could have lit an entire city.

The witnesses never officially reported their experience. Soon after the sighting, the witnesses were having din- ner with a local businessman. During their conversation, they mentioned their sighting. They also showed the man the photo of the object which had been taken on their cell phone camera. The businessman suggested that they talk with me about what they had observed. I was put in touch with the family and conducted a detailed interview. The observation had taken place at 8:58 PM, as indicated on the cell phone camera near Youngwood, when they observed a brilliant luminous object in the sky which appeared to be hovering or moving very slowly. One witness de- scribed the object as a diamond shaped, or \"oval shaped with a hump at the top and bottom.\" The area around the ob- ject glowed, also. The object was many times brighter and larger than any stars that were also visible on that clear night. The wife said, \"What the hell is that light? Why is it so low?\" The wife no- ticed the moon off to her left, which looked much different than the object. At one point they stopped their car to take a better look at the object, where it then appeared to be stationary. They drove on to a new location with a clear view where they again stopped their vehicle, lowered the driver's side win- dow, and took a picture with their new cell phone camera which they switched into a ‘night mode’ setting. The wife checked the camera phone to see if the image had been captured. When she looked back seconds later to see the object, it was no longer vis- ible. The object had suddenly disap- peared from sight after 3-4 minutes to- tal. Researcher Jim Brown examined the photo using a method called pixel weight scan. Using this process, he was not able to detect any red or green lights commonly associated with aircraft. Another UFO incident involving a similar shaped object, and still under investigation, occurred in Indiana County on December 12, 2006. That incident involved a large silent diamond shaped object flying low and was fol- lowing the power lines The object even- tually passed directly over a car.

On Janu- ary 12, 2007, between 22:00 and 23:00 hours, four lights were seen over Santa Rosa. After increasing their size sud- denly and reaching dimensions roughly four times the size of Venus, they would gradually disappear. Three of them were detected some 45 degrees to the East on radial 090 fly- ing north being seen at their greatest splendor in some 15 seconds, with a 15-20 minute interval between sightings. The fourth luminosity was detected on radial 035, some 45 degrees over the horizon, with a SSE - NNW direction, remaining visible for some 10 seconds before gradually disappearing. Five witnesses agreed that the col- ors of these lights fluctuated between yellow, blue, flourescent green and am- ber. Moreover, residents of the \"El Gua- naco\" ranch 35 km north of Santa Rosa saw at 23:00 that same evening the transit of a green, blue and white light from east to west. This light had a \"sort of tail...\" from which \"...four lesser lights, white in color...\" broke off slowly and progressively. The witnesses stressed that they looked like \"the windows of a bus.\" While it is possible to see lights in this area, they have never had the size and intensity detected in this case.

The probable UFO irra- diated a very powerful white light. He indicated that the pilot, the first officer and himself were witnesses to the sight- ing from the cockpit of their Boeing 737-200, registration XA-MAF. The UFO flew alongside the aircraft, plac- ing itself some 1500 meters to the left of the airliner. The crew lost the UFO from sight when it flew at high speed along the vicinity of the Popocatepetl Volcano, entering a dense cloud bank. Similar photo taken: The witness does not remember the exact date of the sighting, estimating that it took place around October 1, 2006. He specified that it occurred shortly after taking off from Villahermosa, roughly around 6:50 p.m. “It wasn’t picked up on the Ticas radar, aside from the impressive speed at which it peeled away from the air- Brazil UFO Photo taken by Carlos Alberto Souza, businessman. He was traveling by car with his wife Anna Almeida and brother-in-law at the Brazilian federal road BR-267 near Bataguassu, state of Mato Grosso do Sul. Souza asked the wife to take photos of the road and the beautiful scenery, which she did. No- body saw anything unusual and the Colorado Springs Witness report: “On January 9, 2007, I hiked with a friend in the Ute Valley Park. At 5:40 PM, we were coming out of the park, after a two hour hike near Mule Deer Drive. We were going down- hill, facing Pikes Peak and admiring the sunset and noticed a strange light ap- pearing as a horizontal segment of light just above the saddle to the South in the skyline of Pikes Peak. The head- light-like white light was significantly to the left of the peak and was shaped like a horizontal segment. It was far too large to be landing lights, given the apparent distance to them. Initially, the light was linear and oriented horizontally. It was larger than the cog train station and was not a twinkling star. We rushed home to grab binoculars and rushed back to Ute Valley Park. By 6 PM, the sky was dark and I saw no light in that particular region of the sky. This sighting remains unexplained to me.” Thanks to MUFON CMS. Eglin Air Force Base, Florida Witness report: “On January 10, 2006, on Highway 90 and Gult City Road going south I viewed a triangular vehicle with three lights white in color. The vehicle’s frame at night appeared black and it flew southeast about a quarter of arm’s length. The vehicle moved in the general direction of Eglin Air Force Base in Fort Walton Beach, Florida. The objects movement was smooth as though it was gliding. At the last viewing the object was 1/2 dime size, and low in the horizon and lost to the trees. With renewed base activity this may be worth an extra look. When the object was last seen all three lights on the bottom and in its corners could still be made out. I hope this report can be forwarded to a person southeast of me tonight as it appeared to be fixed in its path.” Thanks to Mr. Cannon MUFON CMS liner,” explains Alfonso Salazar, adding some pilots are currently traveling with their own cameras or camcorders in order to pick up these unexplained aerial phenomena.

Friedman Stan Friedman The O'Hare Morality Play The story had everything; heroes, vil- lains, deception, courage, and intrigue. A murder mystery? Spy novel? No, just the observation of an unidentified fly- ing object over O'Hare Airport outside Chicago on November 7, 2006, by roughly a dozen em- ployees of United Air- lines. There were likely other wit- nesses, since in my experi- ence, 90% of people who have UFO sightings don't report them. The time was about 4:30 PM. The object was described as oval and gray with no protuberances and no lights . It was hovering soundlessly be- low the cloud cover at 1900'. It was well before sunset. As UFO sightings go, it wasn't all that special. No crashed saucer, no observations of aliens, no apparent radar observation, and no dog- fights with interceptors. There were some special features. First of all, the observers are accus- tomed to seeing all manner of aircraft at O'Hare, the world's second busiest airport, after Atlanta. Second, the ob- ject departed by going straight up and effectively boring a circular hole in the clouds. So there was an unusual physi- cal trace, though not one observable or measurable well after the craft had left. Peter Davenport is one of the heroes of the saga. He operates the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle and talks to thousands of UFO witnesses every year. He was called soon after it happened and talked to some witnesses hoping to hear from many more. The real hero is Joe Hilkevitch, the transportation reporter for the Chicago Tribune. Peter contacted him and sought other witnesses and tried to get more data from the Federal Aviation Admin- istration and from United Airlines. Both tried to deny knowing anything at all. Joe filed a Freedom Of Information Act request with the FAA which suddenly did some looking and found that there had been a conversation about the case. They claimed they could not investigate the case and that their conclusion was that it was some sort of weather phe- nomena with lights from the ground shin- ing off clouds. How that could provide a round solid image below cloud level before sunset was not explained. United finally admitted they had heard about the case, but they were not investigat- ing it either. A reasonable person might wonder why the FAA and a major air- line were not concerned about an un- known vehicle hovering below 1900' over such a busy airport. Would it not be a threat to air safety? There have been other cases such as the JAL 1628 case in 1986 after which the FAA gathered the package of radio and radar data and swore people to silence. Joe also did something else. He interviewed Dr. Ri- chard Haines a retired NASA Scientist. Dick is in my 1979 video \"UFOs ARE Real\", has worked with a number of astronauts, has written several UFO books, has worked with a number of abductees, and collected loads (well over 1000) of sightings by commercial and military pilots. He has also done work on Soviet UFO investigations. Dick is very active with the National Aviation Reporting Center for Anoma- lous Phenomenon (NARCAP) which provides an opportunity for pilots to report sightings without worry about their names being bruited about and bringing on problems with their com- panies and associates. I am often asked what it would take to get the truth about UFOs out to the world. My answer is that aside from a huge sighting during the World Cup, or the Super Bowl, or World series, it would take a reporter making as much effort to blow the lid off the Cosmic Watergate as Woodward and Bernstein did more than 30 years ago at the Wash- ington Post blowing the lid off the po- litical Watergate. There was substantial backing by the paper. Starting off on January 1, 2007, with a well researched article on the front page of the Tribune, above the fold, would seem like a very good way to start. Comments within two weeks indicated that the article got more hits on the Trib website than any other article, ever (more than a million). For 4 days it was the most sought article, which also never happens. The requests for more information came from media people and the general pub- lic from all over the world. There were of course some villains. The Associated Press butchered the article leaving out comments from Haines, but emphasizing this stupid comment by O'Hare controller and union official Craig Burzych who said \"To fly 7 million light years to O'Hare and then have to turn around and go home because your gate was occupied is simply unacceptable\". Why anybody in his right mind would talk of 7 million light years is not obvi- ous. Latest data indicates that there are roughly 2000 stars within only 54 lights years of Earth of which 46 are quite simi- lar to the sun and with some at least a billion years older than the sun. The An- dromeda galaxy is over 2 million light years away . The Milky Way is only about 100,000 light years in diameter and has a few hundred Billion stars. 7 mil- lion light years indeed. But as might be expected, he was out done by a supposed comedian, Dennis"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"      19 MUFON UFO Journal February 2007 Miller quoted, \"Only man is a narcis- sistic enough species to think that a highly evolved alien life source would travel billions and billions of light years just to snatch a few unfortunates for an intrusive medical exam.\" Billions and billions of light years? No exam noted either. What was he smoking? How about 39 light years to Zeta Reticuli or a few light seconds to a nearby base or mother ship? As might be expected other villains include Dr. Joseph Nickell chief de- bunker of the newly renamed Commit- tee for Skeptical Inquiry (formerly CSICOP). He appeared on CNN as the usual rent-a-skeptic as might be ex- pected based on his many past top of the head comments, knowing nothing of the facts. Another is James Oberg, who unlike Nickell, with his 3 degrees in English did work for a long time in the space program and is often called upon for debunking, stated, \"It is just sad that we keep getting these reports which are of zero evidential value. It's sad because there's a lot of strange stuff in the air that we do need to know\". As usual with the debunkers we have the totally hypocritical thought that if a sighting can be explained as a relatively conventional phenomenon, the witness was obviously a good observer. If it can't (as in this case) be explained as a conventional phenomenon (unless one considers alien spacecraft conventional) then the witness must be a poor ob- server. I cannot stress too strongly that the reason most sightings can be iden- tified is that people are good observ- ers. The problem is the interpretation. One nasty response came from Neil Steinberg a columnist for the Chicago Sun Times (the Tribune's main compe- tition) though having a third less circu- lation, on January 7. The headline was \"UFOs Frighten Me”. No not because of their death rays, or their giant cock- roach crew waving the anal probes they seem to be always inflicting upon cow- ering Kansas Housefraus. He is con- cerned not with UFOs themselves, but with our reaction to them. With the unspoken assumption we greet UFOs with the unjustifiable seri- ousness and respect. We really think they're flying saucers from outer space. The tacit implication is that despite of- ficial explanations, despite all that un- certainty, such sightings are a sly wink by our friends from the Crab Nebula. We used to get our meaning from the sky angels once, now UFOs. We have this veneer of modern knowledge, sci- ence, and civilization. Yet we cringe and flutter our hands at every odd cloud and imagine the wildest stories to justify our ducking. UFOs remind us how far we haven't come. “What a silly rant. I emailed with quotes from Dr. Herbert Strentz's 1970 Northwestern Univer- sity PhD Thesis \"Press Coverage of UFOs 1947-1966\". Steinberg re- sponded that he had indeed done his research for a book The Alphabet of Modern Annoyance. Turns out it was published in 1996 and I could not find a copy here so I have ordered it. I would gather his sources were Weekly World News and an enormous ego. Some have questioned where are the pictures? The object was metallic gray seen against a gray cloud cover and roughly 25' in diameter. A 747 has a wingspan of 195 feet and typically at low altitude is moving only at 100-150 miles per hour. Perhaps of greater im- portance is the fact that judging by the responses to my questions about sightings after my lectures, only about 10% of people who believe they have had a sighting reported what they had seen. Since there was little publicity if any in early November, why would any- body have reported anything and to whom? Once the Trib article and the rest of the media jumped in, then more people supposedly have come forth. Airport radar may or may not have picked up the UFO. The FAA certainly isn't giving out information. Though sta- tionary small objects, presumably with- out transponders reporting their iden- tity and position on the radar would not be of much concern with all the land- ings and take offs competing for atten- tion. The radar would be very unlikely to take note of the vertical hole in the clouds. My first response to the Tribune ar- ticle was and still is very enthusiastic. My posting on UFO Updates noted the contrast between the well written, quite- fair article and comments from Dr. Strentz's PhD Thesis. The high degree of ridicule present in the UFO phenomenon was reflected in the press coverage. The coverage has been marked by superficiality, redun- dancy, silliness, careless reporting, and lack of relevant information. The lack of relevant information was also attrib- utable to the reluctance of the press to ferret out information about the phenom- enon and those involved in it. One of the common claims by be- lievers and non-believers is that most people don't believe in UFOs. Really? Years ago I took a survey in a class of about 100 college students. I asked them to vote with their eyes closed. 80% thought most people didn't believe in UFOs. But 80% of the group them- selves did believe. Within a week of the Trib article and the coverage on CNN and Fox, etc.; a Florida TV station polled its listeners two choices, a weather phenomenon as claimed by the FAA or a UFO? 4477 people voted:. 83% said UFO. I think the rout of nasty noisy nega- tivists has begun. Stan Friedman fsphys@rogers.com www.stantonfriedman.com Book Reviewers Needed! Do you like to read UFO books?

He wanted no part of the Rus- sians and refused. He and Anna we threatened with immediate arrest and they fled to France. They lived in Paris until it was pos- sible to travel to the United States in 1951. During their time in Paris they as- sisted other refuges with food and shel- ter. After they arrived in the U.S., they established themselves by building a restaurant and Tony taught languages and music. In 1970 I was put in contact with Tony and Anna and asked to go to the Tatra Mountains to find the Moonshaft as named by Tony. Allen Hynek and I approached an interested group for funding. In just two weeks, actor Jackie Gleason had agreed to fund my trip. Tony immediately began contacting old friends in Prague by letter asking for assistance that would provide equip- ment and transportation for me when I arrived. Tony contacted Jurek (a nick- name) in Bratislava to give me a detailed map to the cave or to go with me. The Russians had invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968 and were in total control. Be- fore we received confirmation of the necessary assistance, four of our con- tacts were arrested by the Russians and executed. The project was canceled. Over the next 28 years I gathered any information I could find still hoping for funding to complete the project. Tony died in 1976, Anna in 1978, and there was one surviving relative and she has provided much information to the cur- rent time. In late 1998 I was contacted about a UFO research project by an individual willing to fund such projects. In late March 1999 I presented the Moonshaft project to my funding source and two weeks later I was off to Slovakia with a heavy load of maps, sketches and equipment. After a very long trip from Missouri to Slovakia which in- volved many flight changes and the drag- ging of equipment through several airports I found myself about to land in Kosice., which is located in eastern Slovakia. I found myself on the landing approach looking at a large num- ber of Mig 29 fighter planes on the airfield. I was not aware of the yet heavy Russian influence in that small country. After landing I began a 200 mile drive to Stary Smokovec which is located at the base of the High Tatra mountain range. Of course I couldn’t read the road signs and directions were difficult as I couldn’t speak the language. After adjusting to the driving habits of the lo- cals it was an interesting and not too difficult drive. It was a good thing I am a professional race car driver, it ap- peared the local drivers had that back- ground also. After unloading at my new home for the next six weeks I was visited by the owners of a local travel agency that had arranged my travel and hotel needs. They owned a family business. The mother and father spoke little English but their teenage son and daughter spoke fluent enough. We became friends immediately and they provided much needed assistance and informa- tion. I began my search for a very tiny cave entrance in some extremely rug- ged terrain. Tony Horak had given me longitude and latitude coordinates based on low accuracy maps available in the late 1960’s. I had also been given sketches made in 1944 of the cave entrance, the mountains in which the cave was lo- cated, the terrain at the cave area, and pointed out the path to the cave entrance and a detailed map of the cave itself. As he noted in his 1944 diary he cov- ered the entrance to three small passages deep in the cavern as he left the cave"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"      21 MUFON UFO Journal February 2007 for the last time. The idea was to make it impossible for ‘treasure hunters’ who might find the entrance to the main cav- ern from reaching the artifact area. He marked those for me on the map. Any one of the three would appear to be the end of this huge and complex cavern. As I began the search with GPS in hand, I was certain I could locate the artifact if I could find this low cranny which would allow access to the grotto. The cave map indicates a distance from the entrance to the artifact to be nearly two miles. Over that length the main pas- sage drops 200 to 300 meters in eleva- tion as estimated by Tony. There are many side passages to the left and right which he explored only for short dis- tances. birth. The priest suggested checking with the village ‘Major’ which I did. He told me that he had received orders to send all the records to Kosice in the early 1980 or 1981 which he did. I asked if the records sent were for the entire village and he replied that only the Horak records were asked for and sent. I talked with a high ranking military officer who had access to WWII mili- tary records and he placed a call to an old military friend. This man told him that he remembered a Captain Antonin Horak and knew were to check. He called back and stated that those records were not available even to him. Why these records were taken is a bit of a puzzle. It is interesting that the Rus- sians initiated a project to find the cave in 1981. I again explored additional caves working my way into the general known location but there was not time to com- plete the job. I was very close and re- ceived new information after I returned home that confirmed it. In the past five years I have received information from contacts in Poland and Slovakia of the crash of an un- known object in 1663 very near the cave location. Also the involvement of Hitler and the SS in a search for a cave called ‘The Cave of the Half Moon’ which began in 1939. Also the landing of a similar device in Russia centuries ago. In Part 4 I will present details on simi- lar artifacts in Russia, Yugoslavia and the United States. The terrain is extremely difficult and steep with many huge rock formations to navigate. With his sketch of the mountain area in which the entrance ex- ists, I was able to match sketches by modern day climbers of that area. There are outstanding features on the 1944 sketch matching more recent sketches and photographs. There was no doubt I was in the right area and explored many caves having small entrances but failed to find the cave in question in just six weeks. In 2001 I obtained funding for a sec- ond trip of four weeks, this time land- ing in Prague. I traced the history of the Horak family from their vast properties in the Czech Republic to other areas he had gone to during WWII. I found that all records of the family had disap- peared. Even in the small village where he was born I talked with the local priest and he could find no records of Tony’s Ted Phillips in theTatras The Tatras border Poland and Slovakia Spectacular Space Debris Lights up Western Skies On January 4, 2007 at 6:15 AM Moun- tain time, early morning risers in Colo- rado and Wyoming were witnesses to an impressive aerial display, when a Russian SL4 rocket booster reentered the atmosphere after launching a French space telescope , leaving a burning trail of debris that was visible for hundreds of miles. The French satellite was launched December 27, 2006 from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Russia to monitor stars and help locate new planets There were unconfirmed reports of rocket space debris crashing in Riverton, WY that burned an area on the ground 30-40 feet wide. Richard Beckwith, MUFON Wyoming State Di- rector contacted the Sheriff’s depart- ment in Fremont County and was told that some portion of the debris came down near the 45 mile marker of High- way 28 near the top of South Pass. Ri- chard visited the site on January 11th, but found nothing. It appeared to have snowed, and there had been a tractor in the area which was not unusual as South Pass had been closed on the fourth due to snow and there would have been snow plows in the area. NORAD spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Sean Kelly said that the reentry was expected and was being monitored and also com- mented that “objects falling from space are almost an everyday occurrence.” MUFON Members Message Board mufonmembers.proboards55.com Password: Hynek1947 (case sensitive)"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" February 2007 22 MUFON UFO Journal Directors’ Message...

These are the re- sults so far, listed by year and number of case files for that year. The Pandora Project continues due to the generous donations of MUFON members like yourself. Thank you for your support! We still have many paper documents we would like to preserve. Please send donations to MUFON HQ, PO Box 279, Bellvue, CO 80512. Pandora Project is a Success! MUFON’s CMS is a Success! Year - # of Cases Year - # of Cases Year - # of Cases MUFON’s Case Management System (CMS) is a run- away success due to the dedication of Project Director Jan Harzan and Systems Developer Tomas Karlson, who work hard to continually improve its many features. UFO witnesses report their sightings directly to CMS via the Internet at www.mufoncms.com (also accessible through the MUFON web site at www.mufon.com) where the report is then auto- matically routed to the appropriate State Director for assign- ment to a local MUFON Field Investigator. MUFON Staff can centrally monitor and manage the MUFON investigator network and case load from the web site and ensure that cases are followed up and investigated. It is important that all State Directors, Assistant State Directors, and State Sec- tion Directors become familiar with all CMS features to en- sure that cases are properly investigated. State Directors rankings (see page 17) are derived directly from CMS case reports. CMS complements MUFON’s Pandora Project by gath- ering initial case data electronically. During an investigation, it is inevitable that case paper forms like witness drawings, signed witness statements, and media reports are gener- ated. These paper forms are then converted to electronic format by the Pandora Project so that the CMS and Pandora data combined represent the complete case in electronic form.
