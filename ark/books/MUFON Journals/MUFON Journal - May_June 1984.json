It was a clear night and they were using a Coleman lantern to see by. Their poles were propped up on \"Y\" sticks stuck in the bank near the water's edge. They had arrived for fishing about 9 o'clock. In the quiet, warm night, the brothers were standing facing one another talking and keep an eye on their lines in the light of the lantern. The location is only about four airline miles from the outstanding September 1976 sighting reported by Bill Pecha of Colusa and eight other local witnesses. Colusa, a small farming community of about 3,500 people, is about 100 miles north of Sacramento. Reuben was startled to suddenly see bright lights turn on behind Carlos and just over a large heavy stand of riverbank trees, about 700 to 800 feet away. He called Carlos' attention to the lights. Carlos, whose home was in Colusa (Reuben lived in San Jose), was familiar UFO — BOTTOM View CMPT AtOUT <O FT. with the Pecha sighting in 1976 and exclaimed, \"My God, it's a UFO!\" Reuben said, \"Turn the light out.\" Both scrambled to extinguish the Coleman lantern. Carlos quickly located his heavy duty \"flashlight\" lantern and checked for the hand gun which he always carried for protection when fishing at night. The bright, white lights just stayed May and June During the summer of 1983, the MUFON UFO Journal got three months behind schedule for various reasons.

Reuben, a natural clock-watcher, noted the time. It was 1:08 AM. By Reuben's timing, the lights remained hovering in the same spot for about six minutes. When the lights first turned on in their direction, they were quite blinding to the brothers, whose eyes had long become used to the darkness even though there was about two-thirds moon that night. The lights beamed outward toward them for about 600 feet, similar to car headlights, but much larger. They angled slightly downward and were spaced far apart on the flat, blunt front end of the strange craft. As the UFO started to slowly move toward them, both were very apprehensive and Carlos was on the verge of panic. He hastily told Reuben he thought they might be picked up, as he had read about it somewhere. With that, Reuben, who had wanted to stay to see what the craft was going to do, was ready to get out of there too. They scrambled part way up the gradual sloping river bank and hid in some heavy brush, still watching the slowly (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Carlos Genera at spot where he and brother saw UFO Cerny, Continued approaching lights intently. Strangely enough, they were quite aware of nearby animals, frogs and crickets, making a lot of exciteable racket, especially a flock of peacocks across the river at a nearby ranch. Usually animal and insect life quiets down at a close approach. Reuben was even aware of his fishpole bobbing erratically from the bass biting his bait. The huge ship passed slowly overhead about 100 feet above them. Chinese UFO film The People's. Republic of China has produced a UFO documentary film entitled.\"UFOs Over China.\" The film is 35 mm (of VHS video tape) in color for 18 minutes. A science and educational film for UFO fans, it was produced by the China UFO Research Organization, The Journal of UFO Research and the Kun-ming Film Studio of Yunnan Province. People who are interested in it should write to: Paul Dong, P.O.

They mananged to study it intently, observing its shape and light configurations. They did detect a very pronounced, steady, noticeable humming sound similar to electric motors, but really different from anything with which they were familiar. As it passed directly overhead very slowly, Carlos got up enough nerve to shine his powerful battery-powered lantern on its underside. The lantern beam revealed a smooth, metallic surface similar to aluminum. A row of underside lights along the leading front blunt edge of the object extended in a straight line from headlight to headlight. These were red, blue and green in color. A large single red light was located at the center-rear edge, as if a single tail light. They estimated the UFO as being about 60 feet across and perhaps slightly longer than wide. Its overall shape was like a large man's shoe heel, with the flat edge at the front, moving in that direction. They couldn't judge the depth or thickness. As it slowly passed over them, they scampered up the rest of the river bank to the top of the levee and watched the strange aerial vehicle gradually disappear behind a heavy grove of trees, its humming motors never changing pitch. They watched for a few minutes to see if it might return, but it did not. After discussing the startling events for a few minutes, they decided to go back to , their fishing. Carlos remarked thatafter what he had heard, particularly about Bill Pecha's Colusa sighting, and what he had read, that this startling experience certainly made a believer out of him. About a. half hour later they •noticed what they thought may have been the same craft off to the west of them, heading in a northerly direction at a much faster-speed. They continued to fish until about 5 AM, then broke camp and drove into Colusa. They arrived at the county sheriffs office about 6 AM and made a report to the Sheriffs personnel, who took, only a brief account of the incident. At about 10 AM, Carlos called Beale Air Force Base near Marysville, California, the operational location for the U-2 and SR-71 reconnaissance aircraft. Beale personnel were seemingly uninterested in their report as well. After the experience, Carlos had a headache for almost a week before.it eventually went away. 'Reuben had nightmares for more than a week. Both brothers had high school educations and Reuben had two years of college. 1985 Symposium Cliff Palmberg, host chairperson, and Ken and Helen Hanke, assistant host chairpersons, have announced that the MUFON 1985 UFO Symposium will be held June 28,29 and 30 at the new Breckenridge Concourse .Hotel near the Lambert-St. Louis International Airport in St. Louis, Missouri. The theme for the symposium will involve the much maligned \"Burden of Proof with respect to UFOs, but addressed in a positive manner by providing documented evidence.

The transcript of that interview has never been released, although Air Force officials had promised to send a copy to the sheriff of Jackson County while refusing to give Hickson or his attorney, Joe Colingo, a copy. Now a copy of that transcript has surfaced, being given to MUFON by Ran Stanford, of Austin, Texas. Stanford said he received a copy of the transcript from the father of one of the Air Force officers who took part in the interview. Following are major portions of the transcript, which was edited down because of its length. 12 October 1973 The following is a transcription of a report made this date by the following individuals: Mr. Charles Hickson, 2722, Apt. 1, College Villa Apts., Pascagoula, MS. Mr. Calvin Parker, Jr., Same address. The report was made to the following personnel: Lt. Colonel Derrington, Security Police. Colonel Amdall, Chairman, Department of Medicine. Colonel Rudolph, Hospital Service. Colonel Hanson, Veterinary Services Lt. Colonel Gibson, Associate Administrator. Major Winans, Health Physicist. Captain Hoban, Security Police. MSgt. Russell, Security Police. T.E. Huntley, Detective, Jackson County Sheriff's Office, Pascagoula, MS Phone: 782-4333. Joe Colingo, Attorney, Pascagoula, MS Phone: 782-8021. Mr. Hickson and Mr. Parker both stated they were employed in Pascagoula by F.B. Walker & Sons, Phone: 782-3931. Two persons who reported sighting an object at approximately the same time were: Raymond Broadus, Probation and Parole Officer, Pascagoula. Larry, Larry's Standard Station, Market & Hickway 90, Pascagoula. Lt. Colonel Derrington: I think the best way is to let them tell it as they recall it and then, on specifics, let them fill in areas for clarification. Charles Hickson: Yesterday evening — I work at the shipyard and when I come in we decided we would go fishing. And the tide wasn't right and we didn't go out in a boat or anything, we thought we would go down — I don't know whether you are familiar with that area or not where the grain elevator is — on the west bank of the river where the shipyard is. So we fished a while there and didn't have any luck and I told Calvin, who was with me, that we'd go on up the river a little further toward the shipyard. I had fished that area in there and loved fishing in there. We hadn't been there very long — we sat on the bank with our spinning reels — when all of a sudden there was a noise. Well what I just heard was a buzzing. I don't know why I turned around. I guess it was to see what it was. It was a blue light — a real light, bright blue light. It could have been purple or something like that. I mean, I would say it was blue at the time I seen the light. At the time I seen the light it just seemed to stop. I would say it was approximately 25 to 30 feet away from us, and I didn't know what to think. I was real frightened. I was scared and I know he (Calvin Parker) was from the appearance he had. It seemed that it didn't have exactly a door. It seemed that one end of it just opened up. Three things came out of it — and they didn't touch the ground — just floating, you know, slowly, a couple of feet off the ground. And I couldn't believe it. I was just — Derrington: You say three things came out of it. What did these three things appear? Hickson: At the distance I couldn't tell. I mean, it was just immediately where we were. Derrington: How large was the item hovering? Hickson: It wasn't round. It seemed oval shaped and it was approximately 8 ft. wide, it was a little longer than that, and it had to be over 8 ft. high. When they approached us — one on each side of my arms — but I didn't feel any sensation at all when it touched me. And amazingly I was just lifted right off the ground. Derrington: You were lifted right off the ground? Hickson: I was so scared I didn't pay too much attention to what they were doing to him — that was with him. And they carried me through the — I don't know what it was — and as we were in this thing — anything in there that I know of — if I did I didn't have any sensation of touching anything. The whole room like thing seemed to glow. I didn't see anything like light fixtures — just a glowing inside. There were no chairs or anything that I seen. And I didn't see any instruments, although I seen things that I just can't explain what (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Pascagoula, Continued itwas. There was things in there. Dcrrington: What time of day was this. Hickson: It was at night. Derrington: What time? Hickson: Well, I don't exactly know what time it was because I don't have a watch. It was quite a while after dark. Derrington: Quite a while after dark? Hickson: Yes. I don't know — it resembled an eye — but it was a big thing like a globe — but it just moved all around me. Derrington: This thing, or individual that came after you, you don't have any feel for what it was? Hickson: Yes, sir. It had features of a human being, but it didn't have any hands. It had pinchers, or something like that. Derrington: Could you tell if it looked more mechanical than human? Hickson: No. I just don't know if it looked mechanical more than human. They were real pale looking to me. And I do remember specifically that on what I thought was their feet, there were no toes or anything like that. It was just almost round. It just seemed like it might have been just skin tight what they had on. But I didn't see any clothes. I don't know if I was so frightened, but I didn't see any kind of hair or anything on them. One of them made just some sort of sound. It is hard to say what kind of sound he did make, but the other two — I never heard one sound. Inside the vehicle I did not hear any sound. Derrington: You mentioned earlier the sound when this thing approached. Hickson: A buzzing sound. Calvin Parker: Turned around and it was there. Detective Huntley: You, said there were eyes, a mouth, and a nose. Hickson: Yes, I don't know whether you would call it a nose. ,It was something sitting on a body and a sharp thing come out about middleways of the eyes and it looked like an opening to me underneath, and things on the side like ears, I don't know. Parker: When they got me and took me toward the ship I passed out but it just looked like a ghost out there. It was like if something came through that wall there. . Hickson: I don't think I could have possibly lost consciousness while I was inside of it. I don't think I did. I think I was conscious all the time. Derrington: How long were you on board? Hickson: I don't know how long we were on board. There was no sensation of moving or anything. I don't know if we moved. I don't know. After it was all over we couldn't believe it and knew we couldn't convince people of what we seen and we waited a while before we went to the Sheriff's Department and told them. I wanted to get the military in on it. I didn't want any publicity and I didn't want any news people, but after I thought about it a while I figured that was what I should do. Derrington: What time would you say elapsed from the beginning until you were released? Hickson: Oh, it had to be -^ it's hard to say. Derrington: Was it hours or minutes? Hickson: It had to be an hour or so. It had to be that long, but it seemed like an eternity. As far as I know I was conscious but I had no sensations inside of there — I didn't have any power to move. Derrington: How were you released? Hickson: They carried me right back out and I was immediately put on the , .ground. I felt no pain and I felt normal. Then the vehicle was gone. Derrington: During this time do you recall seeing Mr. Parker? Hickson: I don't recall seeing him until after I was out. Derrington: You didn't see him on board? Hickson: No, sir, I didn't. I don't recall seeing him on board at all. As I said, I was scared partly out.of my mind. Derrington: When was the first time you noticed Calvin? Hickson: When they brought me back out on the ground, I believe, is when I seen him again. He was hysterical and sort of looked like he was paralyzed but he suddenly came to his senses. Derrington to Parker: Before you passed put,,do you recall being lifted into the vehicle? • Parker: I recall them getting me and just like a big magnet drawing me to it. I wasn't on the'ground — I was off the ground. I don't remember a thing. I just blacked out. I just stood there like I was froze. Then I finally got to where I could move a little bit. It was like a bad dream. I wish it had been a bad dream and it would all be over with. I didn't sleep more than three seconds all night. Derrington: Do you bringing you back out? recall them Parker: No, sir. When I came to the ship went \"zzzp\" and disappeared. Derrington: Did you discuss what had happened between you? Parker: I passed out. I did not remember anything. Hickson: We discussed what had happened to me. We talked a while trying to decide what to do. We drove to a quick service store and discussed it (confirmed on nexf page)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Pascagoula, Continued for almost an hour before we decided to go to the Sheriff's office... Derrington: Did you have anything to drink any place that someone could have slipped something into your drink? Hickson: No, sir, because we didn't stop anywhere. I had frozen shrimp that was in the freezer that we were fishing with. We didn't stop anywhere but went straight to the river. Derrington: What is the relationship between the two of you? Hickson: He is just a friend. His father and myself back home were real good friends, almost like brothers, and he's been down a couple of weeks now working at the same place that I work... Derrington: Did you hear any other sounds beside this buzzing sound that you mentioned earlier? Hickson: The only sound that I heard was one of the things made some type of noise. It wasn't anything that I could distinguish or understand. Parker: It was just a \"mmm.\" Derrington: Any dust or.... Hickson: No, sir. I didn't see any dust or anything. Parker: I don't know how to explain it. It was just as still like, and everything, and then I heard a ?zzzp? just like that, and looked around and blue lights coming, and I paralyzed right there. You know, just like if you walk outside and step on a rattlesnake. Think how you feel. That is just how I felt. I would rather it had been a rattlesnake. Derrington: No depressions in the area at all after this? Hickson: No, sir. Parker: Something else. The craft — it never did set down on the ground itself. It stayed approximately two feet from it. Hickson: It was off the ground. Parker: Well, really, they didn't nothing touch it — the ground.... Derrington: No exhaust or anything? Hickson: I didn't see it. If it was I didn't see it. But as I said, I.was quite scared. Derrington: No attempt to your knowledge to communicate with you in any way? Hickson: Only unless it was — I don't think it was trying to communicate with us.

Hickson: They didn't harm me I know, that I know of. Parker: They did me physically right now but, you know, not physically but mentally it is about to tear me up. Derrington: What about curiosity. Did there appear to be any unusual curiosity about the objects?

Parker: Not too long ago — now it hadn't been — how long? In the apartments? . Hickson: Yeah. Not too long ago in Gautier there was one of these. Parker: And there was at least 13 or 14 witnesses. Hickson: A dozen families was watching it. Derrington: But this is the first time you have seen anything like this? Hickson: Like that, yes, sir. Derrington: You have never seen anything in the past at a distance that you thought — Hickson: A while back, there was a dozen families out there that said it could have been a flying object. You know — I don't know if it was a flying object or not. Derrington: You saw something though? Parker: Yes, sir. There was about 13 more that did. Hickson: But it was — what they — what we were looking at that night was a glow. It was a real red glowing thing. It 8 could have been a pier light, I guess — or something like that. But:I've never, had any experiences with other things close to something like that. Derrington: Now,' back to , the description of the object. You said about 8 feet in diameter and ;about — ', .'.''. , . ' •  I . Hickson: It's a rough guess. I mean, I'd say that there wasn't enough of an area in there that they would have — too many things couldn't have been in there. \"' i '., ' , • Derrington: No protrusion or anything similar to a wing of an aircraft? Hickson: No, sir. I didn't see anything. Parker: I could sketch a picture out of the craft itself — you know, just on the outside. The inside I can't, now. Hickson:. It wasn't round, it was more or less oblong, or something like that. It wasn't completely round. Derrington: Did you ever hear any motor sounds? Hickson: Nothing but just the little buzzing is all that I heard. Derrington: Did it buzz all of the time or just when it moved? Hickson: No, sir. When it moved. Inside of it I didn't hear any sound from the vehicle or whatever it was. I didn't hear any sound from it while I was in there. Derrington: About how tall were these things? Hickson: Well, it's hard to tell about everything. It had to — it was tall enough that when we went in the opening we wasn't touching anything. Derrington: I mean the individuals. Hickson: I'd say somewhere approximately 5 feet, or something like that. Parker: Of course you know they wasn't on the 'ground so that made them taller than us. You know — as far as getting out walking across, the ground. Hickson: When you are that frightened it's hard to give a good description of something.  . Derrington: You talked about them moving. Did they move with leg motion or — Parker: Drifted. Hickson: Just flying. . Parker: Like if wasn't no gravity around. Hickson: I didn't see any motion of their legs but I know they had motion with what I guess was arms — I guess it was arms because they moved them whenever they lifted me. Parker: And it was like a crawfish or crab. Derrington: Was anything strapped on this, like a sort of pack or anything? Hickson: I didn't see anything like that. . Just the thing, is all. Derrington: Just the body frame of the individual and it was either unclothed or clothed with something very tight fitting? Hickson: Yes. Derrington: Did this creature have two arms and two legs, or what seemed to be? Hickson: It seemed to be two of each one. Yes, sir. Parker: But it wasn't like our arms and legs. You know, well it was on the same basic manner as an arm and leg but it wasn't physically looking the same. Huntley: I believe you told me that it looked more like a crab claw. Parker: Yes sir.

Hickson: It had a glow and I couldn't tell whether it was solid or transparent. I couldn't give you no details of that at all because I don't know. Winans: Was it glowing from the inside or from the outside? Hickson: It was glowing — it was bluish like on the outside and on the inside it was just like — you know, like light.

Winans: Did you feel the same temperature, or did you feel warm? Hickson: I didn't have any sensation — any feeling at all. Amdall: Did you feel like you could have moved? Hickson: I couldn't move. Derrington: What went on while you were inside? Hickson: Well, then — as I said before, they had something — I still say an eye — which I know it wasn't an eye — but, it just circulated around — around by me — and they could do me any way they wanted to — lay me back, or sideways. Derrington: This eye that was under you — you were under constant observation by this eye while you were on the board? Hickson: Yes. I say an eye. I don't mean it in that respect. Well, when something is looking at me like that I guess you would figure you would have to say it's some kind of an eye. It didn't look like a camera or anything like that. Huntley: Now when you were stretched out — I believe you said you were stretched out. Right? Hickson: At one time, yes, sir. Huntley: Did you say — didn't you tell us that they moved the light over you — back and forth and all over your body? Hickson: The thing moved all back over me and all around me. Derrington: Did it move by itself? Hickson: It moved by itself to the best I can remember. I was so darned scared till I don't really know whether I lost consciousness. I don't think I did. I don't think I lost consciousness. I think I was conscious all the time — I believe I was — that I was in there. Winans: Did the projector have any sort of an arm to it? Hickson: I don't know. It didn't seem to be attached to anything. It could have been. I don't know. Derrington: When you regained consciousness, where did you go first? After you left this area?

All names of witnesses are ori file at the center. April 10, 1984, Night, Rhinelander, Wisconsin: While driving down a country road, two witnesses observed a stationary cigar- shaped object about 75 yards from the roadway. The object had a row of lighted openings and several spokes protruding , from the surface. Each spoke had a white light on the tip. While holding stationary at treetop level, the object pivoted 360 degrees and then stopped. After watching for four minutes, the motorists drove past the object and then on to home. They heard no sound. April 13, 1984, 10 PM, Gainesville, Florida: While boating on a local lake, two witnesses.observed Huntley: Kimisky. Colingo: What did he do? Call in to the police station last night or something? , Or report seeing some object? Or what? Huntley: No, you are talking about Larry. He owns a Standard station. Evidently — the chief passed this on to me this morning — that Larry saw the same thing. Said he walked out on his porch and he looked up at the sky and... Colingo: And that was unrelated to this? He just apparently reported it also to the Sheriff? Huntley: Right. Rudolph: That was what I was asking. Did these people report the incident — Huntley: Right. They were unrelated as far as I know. an oval-shaped object in a stationary position about 100 yards from their boat. Holding at an altitude of about 100 feet, the object shined a cone of bright white light onto the surface of the water. After about, three to four minutes, the object moved out of sight behind some trees. No sound was heard. April 19, 1984, 8:05 PM, Llano, Texas: Five members of one family observed a!\"huge\" dome-shaped object pass over their .house at an altitude estimated at 200 feet. The object had red lights going around it and a jet aircraft appeared to be in pursuit. The mother said they could hear a loud humming sound coming 'from the object. At one time it was seen traveling across the sky at a high rate of speed. April 20, 1984, 10:04 PM, Beaverton, Oregon: Four occupants of a car observed a \"huge\" bright yellow, pulsating object high in the sky. The driver stopped the car and as the four watched a small bright blue object came into view moving toward the yellow object at a high speed. The blue object moved up to the yellow object, started to maneuver around it when suddenly a \"really fast red thing\" shot out of the blue object and \"blew the yellow thing in half.\" One part of the yellow object immediately disintegrated and the other half fell toward the ground and disintegrated. Then the group spotted another large yellow object and a small blue object in another part of the sky. The yellow object — moving from a stationary position — instantly moved across the sky at a high speed \"and the little blue thing went right up after him and shot him.\" The yellow object fell from the sky \"and went out.\" The blue object then went into a high speed vertical climb and vanished thru the cloud layer. The duration of the two events was about 20 minutes.

In a story published March 4,1984, written by Martin Bailey, the weekly Sunday newspaper said: \"Copies of 16 reports on sightings over Wales have been sent by the MoD to the British UFO Research Association. \"If it's only a small step forward for Whitehall — which stresses that there is no suggestion they come from outer space — it's a giant leap for the hitherto ridiculed alien craft watchers. \"Until now,-the-Government had always refused to release details of UFO incidents passed to it. Six years ago, the Earl of Clancarty — who founded the UFO group in the House of Lords — did launch a debate, but then the government line was that it was not prepared to release information. \"Now, following more pressure .from the Lords, the MoD has finally relented. A ministry spolesman confirmed yesterday that the department . was now willing to 'consider providing reports on specific incidents to serious inquirers.', \"The Observer has been given a copy of the first list of 'sightings' and has UFO Hotline, Continued April 25, 1984, 9:55 PM, Near Napa, California: While traveling oh American Canyon Road, three witnesses observed a triangular-like object which the .driver described as being \"huge, massive, at least the size of a football field.\" The object was stationary over the roadway at an estimated altitude of 100 feet. As the car passed under the object the witnesses' observed structural details. AFter being watched for about five minutes, the object moved out of sight following the Canyon Road. May 5, 1984, 2:55 AM, Piedmont, South Carolina: The witness heard a loud pulsating sound and .looked out the window in time to see a large object come into view as it passed over his house. Described as ' being bigger than an Air Force C-5-A transport, the object was shaped like a football but somewhat flat on the top and bottom. The object appeared to be metallic and was observed for two minutes. A car on the roadway stopped and the driver stepped out and watched as the object moved out of sight. \"All of the dogs in the neighborhood were howling; They were just going crazy.\" The object was at ,an estimated altitude of 750 feet.   ; May 6, 1984, 10:30 PM, Williston, Florida: A 13-year old boy was busy washing out dog pens when he heard a humming sound behind him. \"The dogs' ears stood up and they ran into the boxes and started whimpering and acting like they.were going to tear down the dog boxes.\" Suddenly the whole area turned red and when the boy looked up he observed a bright red circular object. It remained stationary overhead for about five seconds then \"shot across the field and stopped.\" The witness rah-for the house to alert his. mother and the object paced him to the house. When he and his mother came outdoors the object moved back across the field, stopped, then vanished. At the spot where the object was overhead, the altitude was estimated to be 20 feet. The boy observed the object for three to four minutes and during that period he could hear the humming sound and feel heat. When the young man returned to the dog boxes, the dogs would not let him 'into the penned area. looked into .a typical incident which figures in the Ministry of Defence documents. \"At 9 PM on 14 September 1982, David Mason, a 32-year-old printer, was watching television when he saw a bright light from the window of his Cwmbran home. He called his wife Angela, and together they went outside into the back garden. \"Mr. Mason said the light was 'as bright as the sun and about half the size of the moon.' The couple watched for 15 minutes as it hovered more than a mile away, just above the hill range that surrounds the town. The white light then sped off northwards along the ridge at high speed and disappeared. \"The Masons called the police and two officers arrived to record details of the UFO sighting. This was the last contact that the couple were to have with officials over the case. \"The police report into the Cwmbran incident was forwarded to the Ministry of Defence in London, where operational staff in the air division examined the case. An MoD spokesman said that following these inquiries, 'we are.satisfied that there are no defence implications.' \"Mr. Mason says he was surprised not to have had any further inquiries from officials. 'I do not understand how the Ministry of Defence could have investigated . the case without contacting me with further inquiries.' UNUSUAL CLOUD FORMATIONS \"The Cwmbran sighting \\s typical of hundreds of UFO reports which reach the Ministry of Defence every year. Some incidents are reported directly by members of the public, but most come via police, airport authorities and armed forces. \"Only a proportion of total British sightings filter through officialdom and (continued on next page) 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"LAB RESULTS OF 1966 'SWAMPGAS CASE 1 Some additional information about the famed 1966 \"swamp gas\" case in Michigan surfaced recently, shedding new light on the incident. The information was obtained by Dale Goudie, director of Puget Sound Aerial Phenomena Research in Seattle, Washington, and was released by him and Bob Cribble, director of the National UFO Reporting Center. The broad details of the case have long been known. This is the case in which Dr. J. Allen Hynek, at the time a consultant to the U.S. Air Force, issued, his quickly-condemned opinion that the lights seen could have been swamp gas, a conclusion he later admitted was in error. The material consists of a news release issued at the time by William E. Van Horn, the Civil Defense Director for Hillsdale County, Michigan. It contains a hitherto unknown laboratory report covering the scientific analysis of soil, water and animal life in the area of the reported landing. .   • For those unfamiliar with the case, here are excepts from a statement made at the time by Van Horn: On the evening of March 21, 1966, at 10:32 PM, a call was received from the New Women's Dormitory at Hillsdale College by the Office Of Civil Defense. . .from a student reporting British, Continued ultimately reach the MoD. The numbers fluctuate considerably, and between 1978 and 1983, they amounted yearly to 750, 550, 350, 600, 250 and 390. \"Mrs. Jenny Randies, investigation director of the UFO research asociation, said that crucial information was still missing from the government reports. The final sections, containing the results of the Mod's own investigations, had been excised. \"The ministry says it is not concerned with what UFOs are — only to ensure that they do not have any 'defence implications.' In practise, this means that the main question which interests the MoD is whether they are hostile aircraft. \"It emphasizes that many UFO sightings could be caused by 'satellite debris, ball lightning, unusual cloud formations, balloons or aircraft.' The spokesman added: There is no evidence that alien spacecraft have landed on the planet.' \"Other cases covered in the MoD reports include an incident on 20 September 1982 when a 'beam of green 12 light' was seen near Abergavenny and a 'cottage-loaf shape with bright porthole lights and a pulsating red light beneath\" near Caerleon. \"Four sightings which were made within a couple of miles were reported on 30 September the same year during a one-hour period. These include 'two white flashing circular lights' (Pontypool), a 'white/blue flashing light' (Pontnewydd), ,a 'bright blue light' (Cwmbran) and a 'narrow green band of light' (Pontypool). \"Nine incidents were reported on 19 September 1983 between 5:30 and 7:45 PM in the Swansea area. This unusual flurry of UFO sightings included a 'very large elongated shape with two pulsating white lights at front and yellowish steady lights at rear,' an object which was 'very large, possibly saucer-shaped, four or five lights flashing in rotation' and 'one object split into two parts — three white lights at front and three at back, massive in size, oblong in shape.' *** For a related story, see \"Oops, Sorry,\" in the September 1983 (No. 187) issue of the Journal. that some type of craft...had descended from the northeast, flashed by their dormitory and disappeared to the .south... At this time the girl described as well as later,, the observing of red, green and white pulsating lights. There were 17 of the college students that made this original observation.

I at once called for help from the Police Department...and three cars plus myself were sent in a two-mile area from the dormitory to p the east. I checked the area at the half mile point and after I was unable to locate anything I at once returned to the dormitory. Upon arriving at the dormitory, I was escorted to the second floor and taken to a room facing the east, from where I made the following observation. I observed that there was an object which was an approximate distance of 1,500 to 1,700 feet away from us...settled into a hollow and was apparently either near or on the ground, the two lights upon my first observation were what I would describe as a dim orange on the right and a dirty white on the left... After observing this for a period of about 10 minutes...the lights began to grow in brilliance, the dim orange became red and true in color and the white became a true white. As the lights . became more brilliant, the object or vehicle began to rise. It would rise to a height of approximately 100 to 150 feet, stop momentarily and begin to descend.

The vehicle was also observed to move right to left and left to right, and did so in a very smooth manner. The acsent and descent were at an estimated rate of 25 to 30 feet per minute. (This was estimated from my experience as a commercial pilot.) At no time were any of the witnesses able to detect any type of sound or noise. At approximately 4:30 AM, those still observing the scene noticed the lights disappear and this was the last that was seen of it. The area that this was observed in was by no means a swamp but rather an area which is cultivated by Hillsdale College as a park. . ; William E. Van Horn Director, Hillsdale County Civil Defense I. SOIL TESTS a. Acid-Base Test Acid content of three, which is very heavy, and Base content of seven or eight, which is almost neutral. b. Solubility Test The soil was very soluble in a water solution. c. Composition Test There was no change in soil composition except for a slight additive of Boron. d. Radiological Test The radiation reading on the soil was thirty-one hundredths roentgens per hour. (.31 r/hr.) . II. PLANT TESTS (Green and Fungi) a. Paper Chromatography Test There were found only green and yellow pigments in this test; the blue pigment did not show up in this test, so we presume the blue pigment was destroyed. b. Tests for Measuring Life Functions The plants were found to be healthy. c. Starch Test This was found to be normal. (Content) d. Clorophyll Test This was found to be normal. (Content) e. Radiological Test The reading on the plants was three/hundred fifteen thousandths roentgens per hour. (.315 r/hr) f. Spectrum Test on Plant Clorophyll The blue pigment was gone; it did . not show up in this test, presuming again that the blue pigment was completely destroyed. III. ANIMAL TESTS a. Blood Hemoglobin Test Amphibian: The hemoglobin was slightly reduced. Crustation: The hemoglobin showed no change from normal. b. Metabolism Test Amphibian: 1 Had slower than normal metabolism but now improving. Crustation: Could detect . no metabolic change from normal. c.

John R. Cockrell, 68, was the first to report the sighting to James R. Helmke, MUFON's state section director for Wilson County. Cockrell, a retired employee of'the Map Making Division of the Department of Defense and an amateur radio operator, stepped out the back door of his home at about 7:15 PM. His home, at 11 McCoy Street, is 150 feet south of and parallel to U.S. 87, which runs through LaVernia to San Antonio, 25 miles to the east. Farm to Market Road 775 separates his property from the rear of the Koepp Chevrolet Agency and intersects at this point with U.S. 87. When Mr. Cockrell looked north along the back corner of his home into the darkened sky, he 1 was surprised to see a bright orange cigar-shaped light moving slowly from east to west at an angle of 30 degrees above the horizon parallel to highway U.S. 87. The glowing object, with tapered ends, passed behind his 700-foot-high radio antenna and a leafless 50-foot- high tree. He compared the speed of the object to a truck moving at 20 mph on U.S. 87. He immediately walked from his back door to the driveway to get a more unobstructed view of this unusual lighted object as it silently glided westward. Swampgas, Continued III. Pond Life: Crustation and Amphibian radiation was higher than normal but the highest radiation was recorded in the Amphibian. Also, the Amphibian was effected noticeably where the Crustation was not. IV. Mineral: Sedimentary rocks were slightly higher in radiation than either ingenous or metamorphic rocks. There was no other change, either chemical or structural. V. Water: All microscopic plants and animals were dead. The water had above-normal radiation and abnormally contained Boron. VI. Environment: The environment had above- normal radiation and it contained a small amount of Boron, which is foreign to this soil. VII. Main Conclusion: The area contained an abnormally high amount of 14 radiation from some unknown source. The area also strangely contained Boron, which was found in both water and soil. These two facts are the only ones which would substantiate the presence of a U.F.O. In our opinion, we're not saying that there was a U.F.O. but we also do not know how to account for these two facts. However, we believe it could not be swamp gas because of the high winds on the night of the sighting. With these high winds the gas would not have formed a mass and remained stationary. We also do not believe it was pranksters because we searched the swamp thoroughly for any sign of evidence to explain the phenomenon. NOTE: Radioactive decay took place at 0.6 milliroentgens per hour over a period of three hours. Kipling Vandenberg Jerry Wilson He estimated the length as three diameters of the full moon and the thickness or side view as less than half a full moon. There was no clean-cut shape on the edges where the light stopped abruptly. However, the illumination was brighter in the middle. He was intrigued as he watched the light pass out of sight over the one- story Chevrolet agency building, moving in the direction of San Antonio. The total elapsed time of the sighting was 30 seconds. He estimated that the object was 1,000 to 1,500 feet high. Cockrell did nothing further that evening except to tell his invalid son what he had seen. A widower, Cockrell enjoys having coffee with friends each morning at the Los Santos Mexican Restaurant, which is within walking distance of his home. When Mrs. Norma Santos, 36, the owner, brought his first cup of coffee, he casually commented: \"I aw a UFO last night.\" It so shocked her that she nearly spilled his coffee. \"So did we,\" she exitedly replied. She went on to relate what she, her husband Alfred, 37, and their son Jaime, 11, saw as they were driving north on FM 775 from volleyball practice at the LaVernia school toward the intersection of U.S. 87 in \"downtown\" LaVernia (population approximately 1,000). When Mrs. Santos was later interviewed by Walt Andrus, she noted that Jaime was the first to spot the bright light, which seemed to continuously change colors from red to orange to yellow. Since her husband was driving, he didn't obtain a good view until they parked their car in front of their restaurant on U.S. 87. At this point they all got out and both Mr. Santos and Jaime watched what they called a \"ball of light\" move slowly westward above U.S. 87.

She described it as a \"solid orange light about 12 feet long.\" Mr. Santos and Jaime continued to observe the silent slow-moving light until it passed the Chevrolet building, thus blocking their view. Their viewing time was considerably longer than that of Cockrell's, since their view to the east was not hampered as his was by his home. They drove four blocks from the time Jaime first saw the light until they got out of their car. None of them tried to guess at the total elapsed time of the sighting, since each was different.

Koepp said: \"I felt a RICHARD HALL HONORED The MUFON 1984 UFO Symposium Proceedings were dedicated to Richard H. Hall in recognition of his outstanding contributions to ufology. He was cited for \"his writing, leadership roles and tenacity to solve the UFO phenomenon as an officer, of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) and the Mutual UFO Network during the past 16 years.

A hypothetical explanation suggested for the rumbling sound could be a frequency below the human audible range that caused the buildings to vibrate. The National Weather Service in San Antonio provided the following weather conditions for February 15, 1984: 7:00 PM: Sky was clear, visibility was 15 miles, temperature 65 degrees, dew point 16 degrees, wind direction was 330 degrees (NNW) at 9 mph, barometric pressure at sea lever was 29.94 and,rising. 8:00 PM: Sky was clear, visibility 15 miles, temperature 61 degrees, dew point 18 degrees, ..wind direction was northwest at,7 mph, and the barometric pressure corrected to sea level was 29.95 and rising. Officials at the FAA Flight Control at San Antonio International Airport said they had no unidentified targets on their radar scope during this period. When Walt Andrus interviewed Dan Mapes, FAA Supervisor, Mapes said that the lowest certified altitude that their radar was effective over LaVernia was .2,500 feet.

Duich brought to mind for many MUFON members the sighting of a UFO over the Strategic Air Command Headquarters at Offutt Air Force Base while he was on active duty there in 1958. Duich, 67, died December 31, 1983, of a heart ailment. He was a research engineer in the Flight System Division and Performance Depart- ment of the Rockwell Space Division in Downey, California, working on the Space Shuttle program. Duich, a navigator, was a major at the time of the 1958 sighting. An excellent account of the incident was published in The UFO Evidence, published in 1964 by the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), and is reprinted here: At SAC headquarters in 1958, a group of officers, airmen, and missile engineers observed an elongated UFO with satellite objects for about 20 minutes. The case was reported to NICAP by Major Paul A. Duich, USAF (Ret.), one of the witnesses, who was then on active duty. Until recently, Major Duich was an Air Force Master Navigator, accumulating 4000 flying hours and 300 combat hours. During World War II he was one of those who saw \"foo-fighters,\" while crew member of a B-29 making bomb runs on Japan. The time was approximately 1840. The date: 8 September 1958.1 had just ordered dinner at the Officers Club, Strategic Air Command Headquarters, Offutt Air Force Base, Omaha, Nebraska. I excused myself from my friend and co-worker, Major , and went out the side door to cross the open space between the club and the Visiting Officers Quarters next door. I 'wanted to buy a newspaper in the lobby of the VOQ to read after dinner. As I crossed the open area, something caught my eye. Glancing up and to the west, I noticed what appeared to be a short vapor trail in an otherwise clear, blue sky. There were no clouds. The sun had just set. I continued walking but somehow that vapor trail didn't register properly. I have seen thousands of vapor trails but Lavernia, Continued colleagues where they are both employed. Animal reactions to the presence of a UFO may be significant, since they have never been accused of generating hoax stories or becoming reckless with the truth. We will quote directly from the written report submitted to Morgan by Walter C. Shocke, who lives two miles south- southeast of LaVernia off of FM 775. \"On Wednesday evening, February 15, 1984, at about 1845 to 1900 hours, I heard a commotion from the hog pens located about 100 yards from the house. The three pens contain one boar and two gilts. I assumed a varmit or dog was near their pens, so I went out with a gun and flashlight. I was perplexed because the hogs were 16 looking in different directions. Even though I saw nothing to explain their upset state, it took several minutes of petting and talking to calm them down. \"I've owned these three hogs for nearly a year and each displays unique personalities and specific behavior. This incident is the only time they have behaved as if threatened or frightened, and the only time they have raised such a ruckus.\" Schocke was unaware of the UFO sighting reports in LaVernia until a story appeared in the Wilson County News. There may be no connection whatsoever between the animal reactions and the unusual object passing over LaVernia; however, a report is not complete until all aspects are considered and evaluated. PAUL A. DUICH this one was peculiar. I did a double take at that point for suddenly the short 'vapor tail' became a brilliant source of light, much the same as a magnesium flare. I stopped dead in my tracks and watched. The light was intense, but the \"vapor trail\" hung motionless. Even a short trail shows generation and dissipation as the aircraft moves across the sky. I watched for several minutes — maybe 2 or 3 — before I called to another officer: \"Hey, what do you make of that?\", pointing to the spot in the sky. He replied, \"Looks like a short vapor trail.\" I pointed out that it wasn't moving or growing or diminishing in size. He stopped to gape and several others joined us. By then, I decided this called for a better look. What we all agreed, rather quickly, was that the vapor was reflecting sunlight, the effect being similar to a sun-dog, even though the sun had already slipped below the horizon. As . the small crowd gathered, I hurried into the VOQ office and called the Offutt tower. I asked the tower operator to look west, about 30 degrees from the horizontal and tell me what he saw. \"Looks like a short vapor trail. Very odd.\" (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Duich, Continued \"Vapor trail iny foot! Look at it now.\" I could see it through the window as I talked to the' tower operator. The glow was now diminishing and changing to a dull red-orange and at the same time the fuzzy appearance t gradually took on a solid look, in the distinct shape of a pencil or slender cigar. The ' upper end was blunter.than the lower end. By then all those in the office were curious and we all stepped outside to join the 10. to 20 others who had gathered to gape at the thing. All or a sudden we all started checking each others faces for some silly reason — for assurance of reality, perhaps, for as we watched there appeared at the lower end of the object a swarm of black specks cavorting, every which way, much like a swarm of gnats. This, procedure continued for a minute or so before they (the black specks) disappeared. Then the object, which had hung motionless on the same spot, slowly changed attitude from an upright position to a 45 degree angle with the, horizontal and started 'moving slowly toward the west. At the same time there was no drastic change in the,coloring, but a perceptible color change/did take place. It remained a dull orange-red color and continued its westerly movement.

About 5 minutes before we lost it completely (as it faded into the haze just above the horizon) ' the object changed attitude again;'back; toward the 45 : degree position.'but.npf quite: ; \"< .' .! . : .• '>\"'.^.> •' •':',. As it .continued-on-jts... westerly path, it maintained this last .attitude until completely swallowed up by the haze. It never did drop'- below' the horizon ^'just faded away. The fading, of course, was due to the many miles of hazy atmosphere between us and the object. The sky was cloudless, but ,the western horizon did have, a slight haze, readily .apparent against the bright background. About 10 minutes after I sighted the object, a full colonel set up a tripod and 35 mm camera with color film and took several photographs of the object. He later denied getting any successful exposures after I asked him on several occasions. • Immediately after the object faded away, we asked one another what it was we saw. The popular answer/was, \"I don't know, but I saw something.\" . The crowd was composed of airmen, 'officers 1 and civilians (at least 25 officers' 1 , and airmen were present). . Several of the officers .(and, possibly a few civilians) were from the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division in Los Angeles. Several more, 'like myself, were Operations personnel engaged in a SAC planning session at the,time. All except a few of the airmen were seasoned, veteran flyers or highly trained/missile engineers. We concluded that what'was seen by all was no conventional vehicle, nor was it an.atmospheric phenomenon.

I called the filter center and reported the facts over the telephone in the presence of a fejlow officer and co- worker.

I am still waiting — 5 l / 2 years later. 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"LETTERS Editor, The January '84 MUFON UFO Journal contains much thought- provoking and risk-taking material and I enjoyed it. I am writing in response to your invitation to let you hear my reaction to any and all articles. The three \"biggies\" are John Schuessler's \"Estimate of the Situation...\"; Bob Pratt's (your) \"Truth About the Ellsworth Case,\" and Michael Lewis' \"Earth-Based UFOs\". I'm glad to see a \"pro-UFO\" publication analyze an incident (Ellsworth) which is now believed to be a hoax. All persons interested in UFOs benefit when researchers such as yourself \"tell it like it is\" and don't hesitate to do some of your own housecleaning and debunking. With this attitude in mind, I was excited to read Schuessler's article, which could be editorially subtitled \"Give 'Em Hell, John.\" I'm only beginning to appreciate the fairly small community of UFO researchers — the personalities and politics behind the publications I read. While politics shouldn't be the major focus of MUFON Journal, this wake and shake article appears to be useful. I would like to respond to a few points in his article: —Yes, there are no UFO publications on magazine racks and in bookstores. What has been done to get MUFON UFO Journal, International UFO Reporter, etc, into shops and libraries? I remember — and it has to be less than eight years ago — seeing UFO mags (albeit sensational probably) at drug store magazine racks. —I love it when you take Philip Klass to task! But a certain point of saturation can be reached, and we'll have to ignore him in favor of using space for something positive. —Sorry to hear the professional UFO researchers are being forced by debunkers to take the \"safe\" route. Let's do more to praise and give support to those who do take risks. —The dissection of NICAP, APRO, CUFOS, and even his own organization MUFON is a real eye- 18 opener. I often wondered why, even though I was on the CUFOS mailing list, no other UFO organization solicited me. Now I know — lack of co- operation and enough volunteers. Maybe MUFON Journal could occasionally print how to get other organizations' bulletins. Just out of curiosity I'd like to get one from APRO. —Concerning the plight of Wendelle Stevens, I am inclined to agree with MUFON Journal's printing his situation with the law, but only because he claimed his indictment was due to harassment for his UFO activities.  • —The last sentence is the key to why people keep researching, reading journals, paying dues. It should be framed at the next convention, and hung on the wall. On Lewis' piece, I say \"weird, totally weird\" — but I'm extremely interested in knowing what people are thinking when they drop out of MUFON leadership. I'm glad he wrote down his thoughts. I only wish a professional reporter could have interviewed him and made him dig in and clarify the \"who, what, where, when and why\" more. So, thanks for a courageous publication. Go for it! Diane L. Woelfel Boulder, Colorado A subscription to The APRO Bulletin can be obtained by writing to the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization, 3910 East Kleindale Road, Tucson, Arizona 85712. It costs $15 a year in the U.S., $16 in Canada and Mexico and $18 in other countries ($21 for air mail). The Center for UFO Studies publishes several publications, among them the International UFO Reporter. It costs $15 a year in the U.S. and$20 in other countries ($25 airmail). Write to: CUFOS, P.O. Box 1621, Lima, Ohio 45802. APRO, CUFOS and, of course, MUFON are happy to accept even larger contributions if subscribers wish to be more generous. Editor, Using MUFON's sample letter as a guide, I have prepared a letter to my state representatives in the U.S. Congress urging formal hearings on government secrecy and misinform- ation as it pertains to the UFO phenomenon. However, as MUFON has implied, my request would carry greater weight if I could offer my Senator/Representative evidence of the government's coverup and/or dissemination of misleading UFO information as attachments to my letter. Regrettably, I have no photostatic evidence in my possession. To solve this problem that I and other MUFON members may have, perhaps MUFON (with cooperation from Larry Fawcett and Barry Greenwood, authors of \"Clear Intent\") could include samples of such government correspondence in an upcoming issue of the Journal. Single- page government letters would be best. MUFON members could then remove, xerox and forward these government communications as attachments to their letters to Congressional representatives. Thomas B. Burch Poolesville, MD Unfortunately, the Journal doesn't have enough space to publish samples of such documents. However, theFund for UFO Research offers a large selection of such documents. We suggest readers write to the Fund, at P.O. Box 277, Mount Rainier, MD 20712 for a price list. Editor, I am interested in contacting individuals who have had UFO sightings and/or encounters for the purpose of offering my services as a professional hypnotist. I have a special interest in assisting these people to retrieve lapses in memory which often result from these experiences. I maintain that lapses of memory of UFO related experiences are a natural unconscious defense mechanism. This defense against the extreme mental confusion results from events far outside one's accustomed definitions of reality. This memory loss occurs in the absence of any other means of understanding the episode. Any lapse of memory of this sort can be unnerving and hypnosis can be most helpful in restoring needed peace and mind to the subject. In addition, if (confirmed on nexf page)"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Letters, Continued the subject so chooses, the regained body of details can be a valuable addition to the collection of data already on record for futher study of the phenomena. I can assure your readers of the most professional and ethical service as a representative of the American Council of Hypnosis Examiners, from whom I received my training and certification. I am also registered with the Hypnotists Examining Council in California.

Editor, In response to your article in the January issue of the Journal, I am conveying my thoughts on future cooperation with the National Enquirer. Perhaps you can communicate my sentiments to the Board of Directors. I feel that whether or not we hit the target as planned is a moot point, as the wrong audience was targeted. The readership of the National Enquirer consists largely of middle aged or older housewives of fairly low educational background. Certainly there is nothing wrong with being middle aged or elderly, nor with being a housewife. But why would we court a relatively undereducated audience? The very fact that this audience purchases and reads the Enquirer indicates that they are a rather credulous lot. While such a population could increase Journal circulation, it is unlikely that it would provide us with new, serious ufologists. It might be useful to look at those segements of society which do not read the Enquirer. I can guarantee that academics do not place the Enquirer very high on their reading lists! This is certainly true also of the professions (engineers, scientists, physicians, attorneys, business men), the military, industry leaders and policy makers. I doubt seriously that those individuals in a position to dispense funds from private foundations keep up their subscriptions. Like most of the supermarket tabloids, the National Enquirer has a reputation for sensationalism and fabrication. It may be unfortunate, but it is true that 'you are known by the company you keep.' Mixing UFOs with such circus favorites as Jackie Onassis and Princess Di can only trivialize ufology, and reenforce the skeptical attitudes of many citizens. It is a poor vehicle for public education of any type. I believe that there are alternatives. There are many literary, picture, and quasi-technical magazines which'may be agreeable to publishing well written and thoughtful articles on UFOs. Has MUFON diligently pursued these avenues? These magazines may well be interested in some sort of point-counter point articles between ufologists and skeptics in an attempt to offer what they perceive as a balanced view to its readers. But even if MUFON can find no national publications willing to present MUFON material, I think it is a very serious error to cooperate in any way with the tabloids. It is the wrong type of publicity and can only cause embarrassment and division within our organization. Joe Kirk Thomas Los Angeles, Calif. Director's Message, Continued Due to the popularity of the trade paperback book Observing UFOs by Richard F. Haines, Ph.D., our supply is practically depleted. We still have a few copies available at $5 plus $1.50 for postage and handling. We are removing this book from our publication listing since we are unable to obtain more copies. We will fill orders until our is exhausted. * * * In January 1980, MUFON published Leonard H. Stringfield's monograph titled The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome, Status Report II (38 pages). We still have an adequate supply at $5 plus $1.50 for postage and handling. For people interested in the subject of UFO crashes and the recovery of craft and bodies, Leonard Stringfield has privately published a new booklet titled UFO Crash/Retrievals: Amassing the Evidence, Status Report III (June 1982), (53 pages). Personally autographed copies may now be obtained from MUFON for $10 plus $1.50 for postage and handling. * * * John Magor, Provincial Director for British Columbia, is the author of the trade paperback book Aliens Above, Always, published by Hancock House (1983). The Preface is by Brinsley LePoer Trench (Earl of Clancarty). Lord Clancarty has authored several books himself. He made an important contribution to Ufology in 1979 when he initiated a major debate on UFOs in the House of Lords in England. * * * On Sunday, August 12, 1984, Massachusetts MUFON is sponsoring a \"UFO Forum\" at the Centerville Community Center in Beverly, Massachusetts, from 9 AM to 4 PM, featuring some of the best known UFO researchers in the world today: Barry J. Greenwood and Lawrence Fawcett, co-authors of Clear Intent; Budd Hopkins, author o Missing Time; Dr. David M. Jacobs, author of The UFO Confrouersy in America; and Mrs. Cynthia Hind, MUFON Continental Coordinator for Africa and author of the book African Encounters. Opening remarks will be provided by Mrs. Marge Christensen, MUFON State Director, and the panel discussion will be moderated by Dr. Eugene Mallove, an astronautical engineer.

Considering that they had only seven months advance notice, Tom Deuley and his fantastic committee deserve accolades for their fabulous job. The committee chairpersons are hereby recognized: Robert Morgan, Steve Lewis, Dennis Stacy, Audrey Paulis, Christine Lopez, Pat Powers, Elmer Romigh, Al Schuette and Walt Andrus. * * * In recognition of his achievements as both a writer and an ambassador of goodwill, Paul Dong of Oakland, California, has been appointed our Representative to China. Mr. Dong is the U.S. Editor for The Journal of UFO Research published in the People's Republic of China, starting in 1981. His new book titled The Four Major Mysteries o} Mainland China, published by Prentice-Hall, was released on May 30, 1984. Paul joined MUFON in 1979 as a Field Investigator and Chinese Translator. * * * Henry H. Morton, State Director for North Carolina, has approved the following realignment of his State organization: George D. Fawcett of Lincolnton, North Carolina, has volunteered to become the Assistant State Director, replacing Mrs. Gayle McBride, who becomes the State Section Director for Stokes and Forsyth Counties. Mr. Fawcett is eminently qualified for this position, since he served as State Director of North Carolina from 1974 to 1980. George is the author of the book Quarfer Cenfury Studies of UFOs in Florida, North Carolina, and Tennessee. Gayle has been the chairperson for the last few MUFON North Carolina UFO Conferences. Mrs. Marge Christensen has selected Barry J. Greenwood to be the Assistant Director for Massachusetts. Mr. Greenwood is co- author of the new book Clear Intent, published by Prentice-Hall. Marge has appointed Joanne Bruno of Medford to fill the vacancy of State Section Director for Middlesex County, created by Barry's promotion. Gus D. Berryhill, Jr., M.D., State Director for Mississippi, has approved the appointment of Rev. Ralph Savarese to the position of State Section Director for Clarke and Wayne Counties. Ralph is a Methodist Minister and retired from the U.S. Air Force after 20 years of service. * * * During the summer of 1983, the MUFON UFO Journal, got behind schedule by three months. Even though we are publishing current material, the date on the cover is not current. To rectify this, two consecutive issues will be combined. The April 1984 issue, number 194, was mailed to subscribers the first part of June. We will combine May and June 1984 as issue number 195 and July and August 1984 as issue number 196. The September issue will be identified as number 197. Each subscriber will receive twelve issues for their annual MUFON membership/ subscription. Renewal notices will be enclosed to advise each member when his or her subscription expires. We hope that this arrangement will benefit all of our Journal subscribers, especially those in foreign countries, where second class mail is exceptionally slow and the issue date compounds the problem. * * * Special recognition is due to Thomas P. Deuley, host chairperson for the MUFON 1984 Symposium, who designed the cover for the 1984 Symposium Proceedings, and to Donald R. Schmitt, State Director for Wisconsin, for the artist's rendition. It is one of the most attractive cover designs that has graced the annual symposium proceedings during the past 15 years. The MUFON 1984 UFO Symposium Proceedings (1984 Pages) will be available for $10 plus $1.50 for postage and handling in U.S. funds after July 10, 1984, by making a check or postal money order made payable to Walt Andrus MUFON, 103 Oldtowne Road, Seguin, Texas 78155 U.S.A. * * * The North American UFO Federation, Inc. (NAUFOF) conducted its official 1984 Annual Board of Directors' Meeting via teleconference on Saturday, June 2, 1984, with Director Richard F. Haines presiding. Working from a prepared agenda, the essential business was conducted without the costs associated with transportation, lodging and meals for each board member to a common location. * * * The UFO Study Group of Greater St. Louis was invited and they have accepted to host the MUFON 1985 UFO Symposium in St. Louis, Missouri, which will be held on June 28, 29 and 30,1984. Clifford Palmberg is the general chairperson and he will be assisted by Kenneth Hanke. Meeting monthly since February, they have set up seven distinct committees, proposed a list of potential speakers, established a budget, and evaluated location sites. The active committee is composed of Barbara Becker, Frank Brown, Helen and Ken Hanke, Cliff Palmberg, Mike Shannon, Karen Teller, Bruce Widaman and Spencer Wolling. * * * The Fund for UFO Research has contracted with TYMNET of California to provide a nationwide wired computer service to be known as UFONET. UFONET has been set up to (a) decrease the response time between the initial report of a UFO sighting and the subsequent investigation and (b) to decrease the time it takes UFO investigators to detect a local concentration of sightings or to detect the onset of a general \"flap.\" If you have a CRT terminal, a modem (300 baud rate) and a printer and would like to participate in this unique network, please contact Bruce Maccabee, Fund for UFO Research, P.O.
