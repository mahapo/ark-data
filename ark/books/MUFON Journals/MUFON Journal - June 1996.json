Televised programming in recent years has sharpened this awareness. That very information, how- ever, is itself a two-edged sword. The knowledge alerts individuals to suspect, from earlier unresolved experiences in their own lives, that they too might have been abducted, prompting some to seek a sympathetic ear to convey their misgivings. But it also affords them certain information they may not have previously had: greyish or white-skinned beings who pass through windows and walls, levitating beams of light, an unseen force paralyzing the person on an ex- amining table, or fetuses floating in aquarium-like tanks aboard an alien ship. Little wonder that most entrenched mainstream sci- entists, psychologists and journalists refuse to make an effort to adequately investigate the subject, yet, despite their fundamental ignorance, eschew any mention of possible alien abduction. Their skepticism, and ironically the continuing sym- pathetic attention by syndicated TV series, cause those of us who care about truth to dig ever deeper into the minutiae of purported abduction events. When a variety of details, not widely if ever published or aired, can be assigned to multiple CE-4 cases, the chance of coinci- dence, delusion or fraud eventually becomes vanish- ingly small. THE PROJECT As previously published in the MUFON UFO Journal (February and March 1994 issues) and in the Proceedings of MUFON's 1995 International UFO Symposium, the project has utilized audiotapes submit- ted by 17 veteran abduction researchers. This paper an- alyzes the results of 766 tapes involving 216 separate cases. Regressive hypnosis was used in the great ma- jority, though 33 cases relied on conscious recall alone. A corps of unsung MUFON volunteers transcribed the tapes. The transcripts were reviewed for descriptive content, resulting in well over 2,000 factors, the great share re- peated numerous times. These were divided among 53 categories in respect to the vehicle's exterior and interior; entity appearance, behaviors, communications, and pro- cedures; physical and other effects on the abduction subjects; and much more. A computer houses every- thing. THINK GROUPS, NOT TYPES The single most important points concerning alien visi- tations are twofold: First, entities work in groups. A given group is usu- ally composed of several distinct entity types (\"species,\" presumably), whose actions and roles are quasi-military. Each has particular physical characteristics, assigned duties, abilities and, by observation, comparative rank within the group. A number of subjects described eight, ten or even a dozen types across multiple experiences, not all of which were involved in a given event. Apparently assignments vary according to the group's needs on a particular night. Second, there are at least several groups. They have overlapping yet seemingly separate agendas, not all of which are necessarily compatible. LIMITATIONS OF HYPNOSIS Regressive hypnosis as a technique for memory recall is no panacea — with good reasons: • Successful hypnosis depends on the person's deep mental relaxation and trust in the instructions of the hypnotist. • Intruding entities induce a hypnotic effect of their own at the outset, rendering the person \"dazed\" or \"dis- oriented.\" • Many subjects convey having been specifically in- structed either to forget the experience or not to disclose the event or aspects of it to anyone else. • The nature of an encounter for some is so terrifying — or humiliating — as to be partly or entirely erased from memory as a coping mechanism. • For some subjects, the surroundings (one's bedroom and the ship's interior) are always dim or dark. Others relate having been instructed not to look or were ren- dered unconscious at some early point in the event. • To avoid reducing a session to an interrogation, ques- tions of descriptive detail are often skipped. JUNE 1996 NUMBER 338 PAGE 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL • Numerous subjects in the study fail to return for fol- lowup sessions which might elicit more insights. Nonetheless, solid patterns have emerged. COMMONALITIES [Note: Specific factors from the project's database throughout the remainder of this report are shown in italic.] Precognition, for our purposes a foreknowledge of alien intrusion from minutes to many hours prior, was indicated in 22 cases. Separate but related, 48 subjects felt an immediate presence in the home moments before a being was seen or heard. Nearly half (105) of the study's subjects had a vivid recall of levitating to or from an airborne vehicle. Many also found themselves gliding a few inches above the floor of the ship or floating up onto an examining table. There were no surprises relative to general UFO case reports in terms of object shape: Among 90 cases in to- tal, discs were noticed in 64, cylindrical objects in 17, spheres in 19 and triangular vehicles in 14. Rectangular, ovular, conical and boomerang (crescent) shaped crafts were seen in a few cases each. The examining room was round or nearly so in 70 of 80 cases in which a room's shape was discerned. That is consistent with the preponderance of discs in the study. Among the interior furnishings, the centerpiece was usually the examining table; mentioned in 107 cases. Significantly, 30 subjects recalled a very large room, of- ten with numerous tables — a human processing plant. Other notable interior features were counter tops (22 cases) and/or cabinets (16), a window to the outside (35) that often \"magically\" appeared, and ever present hallways. Apart from being mentally dazed, 116 people re- ported being physically restrained: 102 via paralysis and 27 with straps attached to the exam table. Curiously, 13 were strapped down in childhood abductions but in later years paralyzed. Anesthesia has often but not universally been ap- plied. To that end, 19 subjects ingested a fluid, while 34 felt a numbing effect, typically from an entity's touch. And 57 were rendered unconscious at some point, again from a being's touch or hand-held instrument. Nevertheless, 49 anesthetized subjects experienced significant pain in that or another event. Among all cases in the project, pain was an element in 78. The findings do not support an assertion that most captives are subjected to procedures related to repro- duction. Of 73 males in the study, 20 related having sperm involuntarily removed. Among 149 females, 34 recalled the extraction of ova, insertion of embryos and/or removal of fetuses. ENTITY APPEARANCE So who are these guys? To make some sense of the goulash, four essential characteristics were sought in every case: skin tone, height, garment type and gar- ment color. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that diminu- tive \"flight attendants\" who conduct the actual abduc- tions usually have grey to nearly white skin. Taller va- rieties with more substantive roles, usually remaining on the ship, also have skin tones in that range. Others among them are greenish, tan/beige or \"pale.\" Skin tone was preferred in 132 cases: grey in 76, white in 43, bluish-grey in 15, greenish-grey in 21, tan in 19, and pale fleshtone in 18. Entity height was assigned in 146 cases and arbi- trarily categorized as follows: short (well under 5 feet — 110 cases), taller (about 5 to 6 feet or at least taller than others — 102), and extremely tall (over 6 feet, fre- quently over 7 feet — 28). Garments viewed were of five or six basic styles and reported in 119 cases: a form-fitting wetsuit or looser jumpsuit (51 cases combined), a floor-length robe (48), a lab-type coat or jacket (16), and a cape or perhaps longer cloak (10 combined). Naked beings were cited in 30 cases. The most prevalent garment colors in the study were the basics: black (25 cases), blue (21), grey (25), silver (16) and especially white (42). A bove, 216 separate cases of alien abduction, in- volving 766 regressive hypnosis sessions and at- tendant interviews, were analyzed for commonalities. However, it is understood that extreme skepticism re- mains within the entrenched communities of profes- sional science, psychology and journalism. The very fact of the same basic abduction scenario appearing in the literature and on television many times over leads them to conclude that each newly surfaced case is noth- ing more than one's recollection of those accounts. To be sure, given the intensification of media interest over the past decade, the veracity of each newly surfaced subject must be questioned, for at least in some small measure all were necessarily affected. Therefore, the author purposely tracked 68 (out of 2,000+) obscure case factors contained in the project's database. None have received more than scant mention in books, magazines or TV programs, while most have never been printed or aired at all. [A separate 68 could easily have been selected and would no doubt have of- fered markedly different but equally valid results.] The only parameters for any of the 68 factors were that it (a) was not at all well known in UFO-related me- dia, and (b) was repeated in at least four cases, but not so often as to be considered common among the 216 in the project. Actually, only nine of the 68 characteristics were reported in as many as 20 cases, the average being 11.6. There were roughly 19:1 odds, then, that any one PAGE 4 NUMBER 338 JUNE 1996"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL factor with that average frequency of mention would appear in a given case by chance alone. [Note: All mentions herein of those database factors are shown in italic.] ROLL-UP OF ODDITIES Suffice it to say that a random distribution of the 68 \"odd\" factors in fantasy-borne accounts would occa- sionally result in two or more appearing in a particular case by sheer coincidence. But what would be the chance of any two cases having several? To that end, five factors shared by two cases were ar- bitrarily set as the minimum standard for additional ex- amination. And the result was rather startling. A total of 33 pairs of cases each contained five identical factors. The accounts of two women (one from New England, one from Michigan) are illustrative. Both observed a UFO with a very dark or black exterior. Onboard, both were strapped to a table, observed a flashlight (i.e., a rod-like device lit at the end) that scanned their bodies, noticed entities' gloves, and sensed a being's love which seemingly transcended mere compassion. Proceeding deeper into the correlations, 13 pairs of cases shared six odd factors. Further, those 13 pairs in- volved just 15 separate cases in total, meaning most of the factors were shared by more than just two. Among those 15 subjects, four mentioned a triangu- lar vehicle (specified in only 10 of the other 201 cases), a raised platform inside (stated in only five others), and an examining table that went up and down (likewise a factor in only five other cases). Four of the 15 mentioned a future mission they were told to perform. Five re- marked on an entity's love, and five as well were in- structed to forget the incident. Railings inside the craft were noticed by six of those 15 subjects — the only six in the entire study. Also in six cases the subject said s/he went through a rough-hewn tunnel. A pervasive mist or fog, an entity's fingernails, a paper-like gown s/he wore, the appearance at some point of a dark vehicle in the sky, and imagery by a be- ing of Earth's cataclysmic future were each mentioned by seven of the 15, while eight said they were strapped to an examining table. The matter of devastating earthquakes, volcanoes, tidal waves and massive regions on fire in our near fu- ture is, of course, very disturbing to contemplate. Certainly it can be argued that showing same to a captive human is a ruse calculated to ensure the subject's com- pliance in whatever intrusive procedures the entities have in mind, as if to suggest that they are the only ones who might save us. Moreover, these geophysical and ecological disasters are in contrast to some decades- old abduction accounts in which the subjects were shown imagery of imminent nuclear destruction. Moving on, nine pairs of cases (10 cases total) each have seven of the odd factors in common. And an eery sameness is even more striking here. Present in four cases each were an entity with a bumpy head (there be- ing only four other such mentions in the study), someone expressing love, and subjects donning hospital-type gowns. Five (among nine total in the project) were moved on a gurney. Six described a tunnel leading to a huge underground cave or cavern. Likewise, a dark craft, a mysterious/og and restraining straps were each part of six of these cases. And seven encountered a be- ing at some point who exhibited an aura. Reports of tunnels and caverns are worthy of fur- ther investigation by the UFO research community, for some sort of alien underground base of operations is im- plied. More disturbing, however, a few of the subjects believe that, while there, they observed and interacted with not only diminutive entities but also very human beings wearing U.S. military uniforms or displaying government credentials. Skeptics of all things abduction-related undoubtedly do not wish to be told that eight pairs of cases in the study each have eight of the 68 obscure characteristics in common. [Coincidentally, these eight pairings involved precisely eight separate cases in total.] Whatever the precise odds of such a high number of correlations occurring by chance alone, they are certainly astronomical. Statistically, it is far more reasonable to reach a very simple conclusion: Their experiences were real, were accurately reported, and involved the same group of entities. In addition to previously mentioned factors, five of the eight subjects observed an entity with a belt on his uniform, while six noticed a being carrying a small box, either held or attached to the belt. BRINGING IT HOME Commonality of entity height, skin tone, garment type and garment color must be considered strong evidence by any fair-minded person. Likewise, the odd-factor commonalities can be ignored only through obstinacy. But did some combinations of cases prove strong in both areas? Absolutely. Case 132, an east coast man, and case 141, a California woman, observed a whitish being with enor- mous black eyes and bony hands displaying webbed fingers and nails — a classic \"praying mantis.\" In addi- tion, both observed individuals with active roles who, they are certain, were human. Each saw a being with a small box and one with an aura. Both were made to wear a simple gown, were strapped to a table, and were transported on a gurney through a tunnel. And a dark- shelled vehicle appeared in the experiences of both. Case 25, a California man, and case 187, a Michigan woman, saw a vehicle with a dark exterior and a white- skinned being dressed in greyish-blue garb. Both en- countered dark grey, tan, and greyish-green entities as well. Both were familiar with a tallish blonde, human- like being dressed in a jumpsuit with a belt and box at- tached. Each recalled a being with an aura who ex- JUNE 1996 NUMBER 338 PACES"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL pressed love and another wearing a jumpsuit with a sash. Both saw pillars in one setting and had imagery placed in their minds of Earth's tenuous future. Then there is the Wow! pair of cases. The same California man in case 25, along with an Iowa woman in case 80, observed a dark vehicle and encountered the praying mantis, describing it as white-toned and skele- tal, with knobby fingers and long nails. They also shared experiences with a naked grey; a short, naked dark brown being; a greyish-green entity of adult human height, citing its heavy brow ridge; and a 6-foot hu- man-like being in a blue jumpsuit with black trim. Through various events, they both observed a box car- ried by a being and black devices aboard a ship. They also made mention of an entity's aura. And each was transported through a tunnel. In short, holy cow! QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Are these numbers only massive coincidence? Alternately, is it reasonable to suggest that most or all of the cases are an outgrowth of childhood fantasies or misconstrued sexual abuse? Then what of the standard psychological tests routinely administered? How is it that a professional in psychology can unswervingly rely on such a test — except whenever a person who falls well within the normal range conveys alien abduction experiences? Then there is the notion that every abduction account is actually the product of an aberration of one's rea- soning abilities upon waking in the night, psychoso- matically paralyzed in bed. But for hours? Or involving both a husband and wife? Someone is suffering from sensory deprivation, certainly, but it does not appear to be any of the subjects in this study. Do these myriad correlations, never before made public, independently brought out by people who have never met, strike no chord with hard-bitten skeptics? The short answer is no. For we are up against a herd men- tality —- people who, until recently, were even reticent to openly admit that there might be planets out there. For want of a \"UFO muffler\" left behind — of com- pounds not from this earth and manufacturing processes beyond human capabilities — mainstream scientists, psychologists, and the journalists who accept their judg- ments without question are locked into a certain direc- tion. Like starlings in flight, some might disagree with the flock's haphazard direction, but to break away by suggesting any form of UFO reality puts their continued acceptance within the group at peril. Moreover, many are plainly afraid to contemplate that our world is being visited by intelligences higher than their own, for purposes they might ultimately fail to grasp. And these we have been calling our best and brightest. How very sad.

Ritrovato I n his book UFOs and Outer Space Mysteries, UFO skeptic James E. Oberg proposes a hypothetical test case to demonstrate that there is probably nothing of significance to the UFO phenomena. His idea is based on the possibility that if among the total number of UFO reports there were a real core of \"truly extraordi- nary stimuli\" and if you could somehow have one year where these genuine anomalies were to disappear from the scene, something very interesting would happen. In his estimation, the number of supposedly \"true UFOs\" would remain at virtually the same level as they would in a typical year when the genuine article (suggesting there is no such thing) is not excluded. Predictably, his reasoning advocates that these \"Unknowns\" are nothing more than misidentifications of \"perfectly mundane\" events. It is his belief that there will always be a residue of reports that cannot be explained after the fact due to the unreliability of witnesses. He also implies that only a lack of complete information stands in the way of identifying the experience as something not out of the ordinary. One of the difficulties in trying to prove an argu- ment, pro or con, as to the existence of UFOs is that we have only UFO reports to work with and not the UFOs themselves (as the late J. Allen Hynek would often point out). Any hypothesis attempts to explain a situa- tion, but is still subject to critical scrutiny based on all known or discovered evidence. Unfortunately, Mr. Oberg's \"thought experiment\" cannot be reproduced since the \"postulated, extraordinary cause\" or \"true UFOs\" cannot be made to go away for one year. As a re- sult, his hypothesis cannot be accepted or rejected di- rectly through experimentation. However, let us see if the circumstantial evidence strengthens or diminishes the tenability of his hypothesis. One piece of information that runs contrary to Mr. Oberg's reasoning is the fact that the proportion of \"Unknowns\" increases significantly when reports with only the highest witness credibility are selected. It is ironic that this fact was discovered by the Air Force when an independent scientific analysis was made of their UFO reports, the results of which became Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14 (1955). In an intro- duction to a reprint of this report by the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS, 1994), Dr. Bruce Maccabee states that this result of the study \"...contradicts the hypothesis that the best witnesses should produce the best descrip- tions of the phenomena and thus should have the lowest percentage of unexplained cases if there were no true un- knowns being observed.\" It is a common belief that Blue Book, rather than created to solve the UFO riddle, was really nothing more than a public relations ploy. It may be defined in this context as a \"front\" to hide from public scrutiny the most alarming material, channeling it around Blue Book so it could be investigated at a higher and more clan- destine level. Although much diligent research, made possible through the Freedom of Information Act, has uncovered a large body of evidence to add weight to this belief, there still are a good number of reports from Blue Book that are of value. This in large part was due to the efforts of Blue Book's founding director, Edward Ruppelt, who took these sighting reports seriously enough to investigate many of them first hand. As a classic example, he managed to dispatch first-class wit- nesses to the scene at the Washington, D.C. air traffic control center during an historic appearance of UFOs over the capital in late July 1952. From the very start of this particularly important event his contacts kept him in- formed while the Air Force chose not to. At the time of this incident the nation was gripped by the greatest UFO invasion in the history of the phe- nomena. The Air Force was still not certain what direc- tion it should take regarding them. Or, if it knew, it wasn't saying so openly. One thing seems certain how- ever. At the highest level of Air Force Intelligence, high ranking officers were worried and they knew some- thing had to be done about the situation. They couldn't make the UFOs go away, but they had to somehow prove to the public that there was nothing to be con- cerned about. Fortunately for the military brass, the prevalence of sightings began to subside and within a few years the Air Force appeared to have a handle on the situation. Captain Edward Ruppelt stepped down as the director of Blue Book when he retired from the Air Force in September 1953. And by 1955, historical re- search indicates that UFO reports were being regularly screened to determine whether they were \"too hot\" for Blue Book. In my estimation, if one looks into the record prior to 1955, evidence comes to light that casts a long shadow on Oberg's hypothesis. If one were to search his book for any reference to UFO waves one would come up empty-handed. He ignores the subject entirely. The rea- JUNE 1996 NUMBER 338 PAGE 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL son, I suspect, is he knows that therein lies possible proof that UFOs are a serious phenomena and one dis- tinctly different from simple misidentifications or overly active imaginations. Looking at the data from 1950 to 1954, a striking pat- tern emerges when comparing reports during an average year to those of a wave year. Within that period a normal year would produce approximately 10% UFO reports to 90% IFO (Identified Flying Object) reports. But for a wave year the ratio would increase to about 20% for the UFOs. Following Mr. Oberg's reasoning, a logical con- clusion would be that the wave phenomenon is only a product of media attention and the resulting public furor. However, if that were the case, and any core of \"true UFOs\" remained roughly constant from year to year, you would expect the percentage of \"Unknowns\" to decrease rather than increase during a wave. And yet, in 1952, when the total reports were three times greater than normal, the \"Unknowns\" multiplied six fold (see Chart A). This is quite a contrast to an expected three- fold drop in their percentage (from L0% to 3.3%) if the standard skeptical view had any merit. Now a debunker might argue that a tripling of reports could overwhelm the investigators so that many cases would be left unresearched, causing the level of \"Unknowns\" to rise to 20%. This may at first sound plausible but such reasoning is false. Since Blue Book threw the \"Insufficient Information\" reports in with the \"identified\" cases, the percentage of \"Unknowns,\" rather than increase, would be expected to decrease even more dramatically during a wave. The actual breakdown of these reports would appear to indicate that if there was an increase in IFOs due to hysteria or mania, such a cause actually followed a genuine increase in \"truly ex- traordinary stimuli.\" Although the year 1952 demonstrated a higher inci- dence of UFO sightings in the U.S. than for any other year before or since, that wasn't to be the end of the re- ports or the wave phenomena. There was another wave of activity in late '57 and again starting in 1965 and last- ing through 1967. Since the early '50s, Blue Book had contracted a civilian astronomer to officially identify as many of the UFOs as something of astronomical origin. This last wave triggered J. Allen Hynek's true conver- sion from the Air Force's formerly reliable scientific de- bunker to serious UFO researcher. The initial event was a flap in Oklahoma in 1965. The Air Force had ex- plained it away as due to an astronomical effect, but Hynek had never been presented with the data to per- sonally evaluate it. So incensed was Hynek that three years later he made reference to this fact when he fired off a long letter to Colonel Raymond S. Sleeper to urge him to revamp the Blue Book Project so that it could be- come more effective at serious research in the field \"of UFOs. Unfortunately, by this time, Hynek's actions were too little, too late. The Air Force had already decided to bury Blue Book. In 1966, congressional hearings placed a spotlight on the Air Force as their handling of UFO in- vestigations was explored. It was recommended from this inquiry that an independent study be conducted to determine the future of the Air Force's involvement into such matters. However, the Air Force (who paid for the subsequent study) chose the University of Colorado and Dr. Edward Condon, a known skeptic, to conduct it. The Condon Committee became their way out and Dr. Condon served them well when his report was made public in 1969. In so many words, in the report's open- ing conclusions, he stated that based on their findings nothing had been or likely would be gained from study- ing UFO reports as far as science was concerned. One thing Dr. Condon didn't speak openly about was the fact that 25% of the reports they studied could not be ex- plained. However, the studys' conclusions were enough for the Air Force and the Press and, before the year was out, Blue Book was history. But with the closing of Blue Book, sightings of UFOs persisted nonetheless. Independent UFO organizations (such as MUFON which was founded in 1969) contin- ued their collecting and analyzing of reports. And, with the first post-Blue Book wave across the eastern half of the U.S. in the fall of 1973, Hynek, in his effort to prove his assertion that UFOs were \"a scientific problem of possible great potential,\" formed CUFOS (the Center for UFO Studies). During his independent search with ufologists and other interested scientists he studied the Hudson Valley wave of 1983-85 and also a wave of nocturnal lights (nighttime sightings of unidentified balls of light) in Norway, but by the time of his death in 1987, was no closer to solving the \"UFO problem\" (as Hynek often referred to the quandary that the UFO phe- nomena presented to science). As an astronomer, it seemed only fitting that Haley's comet had made an appearance in both the year of his birth and of his death. T hirty years prior to Hynek's passing, another scien- tist died who, like Hynek, believed in the scientific importance of UFOs, but in his case it seemed like the answers to some of the UFO riddles might have been closer at hand. Perhaps, at least in regards to the gov- ernment, he was just too close for comfort. His death was due to the effects on his weak heart from serving eight months in a federal prison. The FDA had placed him there for what they deemed to be fraudulent medical practices. Many factors conspired against him, but his own highly regarded academic background, his contro- versial beliefs, and his uncompromising dedication to serving the good of humanity were a sure ticket to mar- tyrdom. Dr. Wilhelm Reich was an Austrian-born doctor, psy- choanalyst (one of Freud's prize pupils), sexologist, writer, and for much of his life dedicated to the com- munist ideology. He was known to be brilliant, driven, and eventually, by the estimation of some biographers.

Of course, even if the latter was eventually true, this doesn't necessarily disqualify his assertions (Nikolai Tesla comes to mind as a comparative case). Perhaps Dr. Reich's failure was that he was a pio- neering type of scientist with no political sensibilities. Unlike Dr. Hynek, he didn't have a cautious bone in his body. His trouble started when he discovered what he termed to be \"Orgone Energy.\" This energy was what he believed to be the driving force behind all life. A paral- lel description to this force would be the energy labeled \"chi\" by the Chinese Buddhists. He began in-depth re- search and started^lecturing on his discoveries in Oslo, Norway in 1934. Five years later, he continued his work in New York City and then formed his Orgone Institute in Maine in 1942. Shortly after arriving in the U.S., Reich developed what he termed an Orgone Accumulator designed to store such energy in concentrated form. Ten years later he used this device to try to test the possibility that or- gone energy could prevent the negative effects of ra- dioactivity. Unexpected results caused him to reach the conclusion that there was also a negative orgone energy. Following the UFO wave of 1952, and the great plains drought of 1953, he came to believe that not only were UFOs real, but that these alien craft were tapping orgone energy to propel their spacecraft. He also became con- vinced that the byproduct of this process was a negative orgone accumulation that took the form of dark \"DOR\" (Deadly ORgone energy) clouds which were responsible for both droughts and illnesses of those exposed to such clouds. In 1954 Dr. Reich used another one of his inventions, the so-called \"cloud buster,\" to not only break up these destructive \"DOR\" clouds, but also claimed to have de- energized two alien spacecraft on two occasions in 1954. He then went on to try to discover how orgone energy might be able to propel spacecraft.

The FDA asserted that he could not prove his claims and that he needed to stop such marketing, or to appear in court to defend his position. He chose to do neither (believing that he had already proved himself in the field of science and that the law had no say regarding such matters) and when the Supreme Court refused to review his case, and after his lawyers warned that prison would surely mean his death (due to his ailing heart), he was found guilty and promptly im- prisoned. As someone who may have come close to un- locking some of the UFO secrets, it seems fitting that he was both born (March 24, 1897) and died (November 3, 1957) during a UFO wave. Even though a UFO wave appears to have caused Dr. Reich to stand up and take notice of the UFO phenom- ena, he never had much of a chance to study why they occur (whether he wanted to or not). Dr. Hynek was con- cerned with UFO waves, believing them to be a legiti- mate aspect of the UFO phenomena and deserving of se- rious inquiry. He didn't know why they were happening; he could only state that \"the only scientifically justifiable statement that can be made is that they (do) exist.\" In studying past waves of UFO sightings, I have come to the same conclusion as Hynek and other re- searchers before me, that is, by finding predictable pat- terns in their occurrence. In the March 1995 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal, I revealed four potential UFO cycles and presented the possibility that the combined influence of several cycles can produce a pronounced wave effect. I proposed that just such an occurrence could make itself known from December 1994 through September 1995. Let us now review UFO activity during the previous year and see how close I may have come in my prediction. Right from the start, 1995 heralded many newsworthy sightings in Europe, beginning with a near-collision of a UFO and a 737 passenger jet over the Pennine Hills on January 6th, shortly before its scheduled landing at the airport in Manchester, England. Interestingly, this UFO was described as triangular in shape, and England con- tinued to witness UFOs of this type (especially over the Pennines) in record numbers during the months that followed (as reported in UFO Magazine, Sept/Oct 1995 issue). Also, Essex, on the East coast near London, had a UFO wave that appears to have peaked at the time I predicted one should occur (in late April). The Canadian province of British Columbia showed an increase in June for Close Encounter cases and the province of Manitoba experienced a noteworthy wave of UFO sight- ings in July. Argentina and Chili also experienced ac- tivity that caused military concern, starting with a fan- tastic close encounter with a jet liner in Argentina on the evening of July 31st (see the December 1995 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal for details). PAGE 10 NUMBER 338 JUNE 1996"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL There was also a large amount of activity in the U.S. from late July to late August. The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) accumulated at least 50% more reports during this period than would normally be expected (see chart B). This same source also received a report in late February that Harrisburg, Pennsylvania (in the southeastern part of the state) was experiencing a UFO flap. In April, NUFORC received a large number of sightings east of there, extending into New Jersey. Referring again to the chart related to UFO activity in the United States during 1995 (gleaned from data sup- plied by NUFORC), it is perhaps more interesting to take note of the increase in activity during the earlier part of the year rather than in August. Normally, February is a below average month for UFO reports (second only to December for the leanest months), but in 1995 the re- ports were at least twice what one would normally ex- pect. Interestingly, the planet Mars was at its closest orbital approach to earth during that month. Mars has a history of being in this position during UFO waves and the results for 1995 only reinforces this possible con- nection. Following my last article I started a correspondence with Larry Hatch, the developer of the *U* UFO Database program. He also had an interest in the subject of UFO waves and through our collaboration agreed upon a cycle that correlated with the known cycle of so- lar activity. He concurred with an 11.2 year cycle that I had previously detected and he found an additional cy- cle of 21.25 years duration. Based on the possibility of there being a connection to UFO waves and solar activ- ity, one might at first assume that any correlation be- tween the two would relate to solar maxima. In actuality, the evidence points more to a link between UFO waves and solar minima. Recent scientific findings show that spacecraft are in more danger during solar minima from an increased accumulation of electron particles in our atmosphere during such times (see the New York Times of 8/16/94, page Cll). Other scientific studies have previously been done on a possible connection to solar minima and an in- creased chance of damaging earthquakes. Similarly, it has been observed that every other solar minimum (20- 22 years in length) coincides with the appearance of Great Plains droughts. Mr. Hatch's research also indi- cated the possibility of there being a 10.6 year cycle (also similar in length to a solar cycle) which was not only half as long as the 21.25 year cycle, but twice as long as a UFO cycle that was discussed in my earlier MUFON article. It should be noted that his program seemed better suited at discovering cycles longer than the ones I proposed earlier. Using the *U* UFO database (which now contains more than 14,000 sightings), and smoothing out the data for all months containing anomalously high num- bers (at least three times the monthly average for the year they fell in), I developed the projection used in the 1995 sightings graph. This was done to demonstrate how UFO reports typically vary from month to month, but in a fairly predictable manner each year. The flow of reports often follows this pattern in the absence of UFO waves. In order to get a rough estimation of the ampli- tude of the monthly projections 1 used May as a baseline since historically it was the least likely to vary from its average. Looking back over the past century, one can clearly see a pattern of UFO activity that fits in with a 20-22 year cycle. Even before the modern era of UFO sight- ings, two peaks of UFO activity stand out. From 1911 to 1941, more than half of good quality sightings recorded (or twice the expected average) were during the years 1912-1915 and 1933-1936 (solar minima occurred in the years 1913 and 1933). There was, of course, a great wave of activity in Europe in the fall of 1954; a year of solar minimum (the *U* UFO Database had 12% more sightings in this year than in 1952). When looking at good quality UFO reports for the seventeen year period from 1969 to 1985, the yearly average during 1973- 1978 was more than two-and-one-half times greater than for the other years (solar minimum was during 1975-76). Based on this scenario one would expect UFOs to soon become more numerous than usual in response to a natural projection of the minimum of sunspot activity occurring in 1997. This estimation relates to the fact that an average sunspot cycle is just over 11 years in length and solar minima usually occur seven years after a sig- nificantly high maximum (as it was in 1990) and four years before the next maximum. However, between peaks of record sunspot activity the period is less than 11 years and between uncommonly low peak activity the period is greater than 11 years. Evidently we are now be- tween peaks of higher than normal sunspot activity since solar scientists recently revealed that the next so- lar minimum appears to be arriving a year earlier than would normally be expected. Therefore, solar, minimum should occur in the year 1996 and a peak in UFO reports at this time would not be surprising. Regarding the other possible connections to solar activity and earthly phenomena, we could be headed for another drought like the one in the U.S. in 1976-77 (and England very severely in 1976 also). 1976 was also an historic year for very destructive earthquakes with a record number of fatalities. For one year, ending in the fall of 1995, the NE part of the U.S. was hit by drought. Chicago had a heat wave in July 1995 that caused over seven hundred deaths. Georgia had perhaps its driest July ever. Oklahoma expects 1995 to go down as the leanest wheat pasture year on record. Massachusetts was experiencing its worst drought since 1883 (the start of the historical weather record there). Spain, its worst drought this cen- tury. England, the driest summer since 1727. Texas and Mexico were also suffering from drought and so too has JUNE 1996 NUMBER 338 PAGE 1 1"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL been Puerto Rico, Brazil, Australia, Russia, and much of China. Some examples of the financial hardship caused by these droughts: 3.8 million hens died in the mid- west, $200 million in damage to cotton crops in Texas, over 200,000 cattle lost in northern Mexico, and Russia had its worst harvest in 30 years. Although the snowpack in the Sierra Mountains was only 30% of normal on the first day of 1996, snow- storms followed to boost snow levels up to the sea- sonal average. Since California relies heavily on this re- source for water reserves it would seem that drought there has been averted for now. Only time will tell if California will fare as well in the years to come. If greater drought conditions are on the horizon there could also be at least as likely a chance of destructive earthquakes' in the near future. For those familiar with the current predictions of Gordon Michael Scallion (known by many of his followers as a modern day Edgar Cayce) this should not come as a surprise since he is predicting earthquakes greater than any previously recorded within California during the 1996-97 period. Adding some weight to his vision is the prediction re- cently made by Michael Lindemann, founder of the 2020 Group (a futurist think tank) and the Institute for the Study of Contact with Non-human Intelligence (IS- CNI, Inc.), who also believes it to be highly likely that California will experience intense earthquake activity in 1996 and 1997, but not at the apocalyptic level foreseen by Mr. Scallion. Turning briefly back to the past, there were great droughts in the U.S. during 1932-1936 and 1953. One of the largest earthquakes ever recorded was in Japan in 1933, followed shortly by a killer quake in Long Beach, California. In 1952, California had its biggest earth- quake since the San Francisco disaster of 1906. The 7.7 magnitude Bakersfield temblor of July, 1952, also occurred in the midst of the greatest U.S. wave of UFOs ever. Earth scientists have been waiting for the Parkfield fault to rupture for several years and it is likely to give way in the near future since it has shown a periodicity of fault rupture similar to and in line with solar minima. However, this could be a much greater event than seis- mologists anticipate as a result of a fault rupturing from a much larger earthquake, extending from as far south as the Mexican border to as far north as Monterey. It should be noted that detectors in the Parkfield area recorded strong magnetic anomalies just before, during, and after the Northridge earthquake in January, 1994. during the same period as there was an increase in UFO sightings in the areas North and West of Los Angeles. Detectors again recorded similar variations later that year (November 20 to the end of December). Besides an earthquake of 5.0 magnitude on December 20, there again was a flurry of UFO sightings in Los Angeles and nearby areas North and West of there about two weeks prior. From my investigations, I have concluded that vari- ations in the magnetic field can both signal coming earthquakes and UFO sightings as proposed in my ear- lier MUFON article. It also appears that such varia- tions occur most frequently during solar minima. A case in point is the European wave of October 1954. In John A. Keel's book, Disneyland of the Gods, Cm the chapter labeled \"Astropaphopia\" under the subtitle \"Magnetism and UFOs\") he notes that a leading scien- tist stated that there was a \"good statistical correlation between disturbances of the earth's (magnetic) field and UFO observations during the one month (referring to October) in the remarkable year 1954 . . .\" It may seem odd that the sun during its minimum cy- cle could be more influential on the earth's magnetic field, but if one considers that at minima any solar prominence would form closer to the solar equator than during maxima, there would be a greater likelihood that the radiation would intercept earth in its orbit. At times of maximum solar activity such an occurrence would normally be likely only during a larger than usual peak. In the years 1947 and 1957 there were UFO waves dur- ing solar maxima, but sunspot activity was also at a greater intensity than usual. Also, in 1957 there were five possible UFO cycles not connected to the solar cy- cle that were reaching a peak. In regards to my other the- ory (that waves are often caused by multiple cycle in- teractions), the 1947 UFO wave remains a bit of an anomaly, however, sunspot activity was at a maximum at the time and at a much higher level than normal. During the last intense solar maximum UFO sightings were at a premium (late 1989 through 1990). Since UFOs were on the scene in great numbers at both of the intense maxima of 1947 and 1957 and even more so at the minimum period between them, it would seem likely that the present solar minimum (similarly sandwiched between two large maxima) will be accompanied by a higher number of sightings than during the last maxi- mum.

Max Littell, Secretary/Treasurer of the museum was on duty when approached by an out of state visitor with another crash site tale. The story had a familiar ring. For Max it was not the first time such a tale had crossed his path. Like many others, it centered around the 1947 debris field. Wouldn't it be great to locate some solid evidence from the mysterious event? It could be analyzed and per- haps help solve the almost 49 year-old mystery and end the controversy. The visitor claimed knowledge of the whereabouts of a debris fragment. He happened to know the framer who mounted and framed just such a piece for a former military person. This ex-military person, name withheld, claims to have been on the debris field clean-up detail that July day in 1947. Max, with a skep- tical grin said, \"Sure, I'd be happy to take a look at the piece if you can bring it in.\" Twenty minutes later, Max, with a non-skeptical grin, was feasting his eyes on a triangular metal fragment framed under non-reflective glass. The dimensions of the piece were approximately 1 5/8\" x 3\", and the color on the visible side appeared to be a nondescript pattern of copper and bright aluminum or silver. Three days later, March 27, the story made the front page of the Roswell Daily Record with a color photo. Associated Press stories on the subject were carried in both the Albuquerque Journal and Tribune on March 29th. An interview with Max Littell on Albuquerque's channels 4 (NBC) and 7 (ABC) were observed on the 27th and 28th. Max had stated that color photos had been sent to Jesse Marcel, Jr. M.D., who saw debris from the crash site as a twelve year old. Dr. Marcel was asked if he could verify similarities between the photographs and what he saw in July of 1947. The next step in the investigation was to seek out a qualified metallurgist with proper scientific equipment to identify the fragment. The New Mexico Bureau of Mines and Mineral Resources in Socorro was highly qualified and readily available to make the analysis us- ing X-ray fluorescence technology. Max Littell con- tacted the Bureau and spoke with Chris McKee, the Department Manager who would be responsible for running the test procedure. An appointment was made for 10:00 a.m. Friday, March 29th. Thursday evening I received a call from Professor C. B. Moore in Soccoro expressing a strong interest in viewing the mysterious fragment. Unaware of the sched- uled appointment, I called Max in Roswell after I fin- ished talking with Prof. Moore. Max invited me to attend the meeting the next day and also extended an invitation to Prof. Moore. At 9:10 the next morning I was at Prof. Moore's front door. We visited for 15 minutes or so and then drove to the Bureau of Mines X-ray fluores- cence facility, arriving there at 9:45. We met with Chris McKee and visited the formidable mineral exhibit on the second floor. This alone was worth the 90 mile drive. M ax and Roswell's Chief of Police, Ray Mounts, ar- rived at 10:30, armed with, among other things, a camcorder and the mysterious subject matter. Chief Mounts accepted the responsibility to record the proce- dure from start to finish. Prof. Moore and I, working un- der difficult lighting conditions, photographed the frag- ment before, during and after its removal from the frame in which it was housed. We were in constant visual contact with the fragment except for the time period in which it descended into the analysis chamber. Chris McKee took all precautionary measures, han- dling the fragment with tweezers to avoid fingerprints, etc. It was necessary for him to bend the piece for ac- ceptance into the small analysis chamber. The fragment suffered a minor fracture when it was being returned to its original configuration. I was able to later calculate the fragment's physical dimensions from my photos, using the known mat dimension of 2 1/2\" x 2 1/2\" framing the piece. See drawing. The fragment had parallel creases that extended from one end to the other with a gaping hole at its center. The back side has a high-gloss silvery look with no copper showing. The silvery colored surfaces were devoid of any tarnish. Chris did the X-ray fluorescence analysis of each side. The beam illuminated a 29 mm section of the sample, which was spun continuously during the analy- sis, so that the results are averaged over the surface of the sample face exposed to the nominal 40 kV X-rays. The front side analysis indicated that it was about 50% Cu (copper) and about 50% Ag (silver). The back side analysis showed about 87% Ag, 12% Cu and 1% trace elements. The fragment weighed in at 16.160 grams. With all the unexpected excitement I neglected to bring along my Mitutoyo dial calipers to accurately measure the fragment's thickness, but I would guess it not to exceed 0.01 inch. Prof. Moore had come to the same conclusion. The following paragraph regarding the fragment was included in Prof. Moore's memo faxed to me on March JUNE 1996 NUMBER 338 PACE 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL The framed specimen: photo by Miller Johnson 31 following the March 29 analysis. Until more tests are conducted that may suggest another point of view, I am 100% behind his statements. \"The fragment clearly was not related to one of the radar targets or any of the other equipment used by the NYU group. Such a diaphragm may have been in the microphone section of the sonobuoys that we flew but. if this were the case, there is the question as to how it be- came exposed so that the alleged GI could have pock- eted it. But, unless this fragment came out of a sonobuoy. there is little chance that it was associated with an NYU flight in 1947. The fragment could have been bent easily: it could have been dented with a sledge hammer if one hit it. It clearly had been torn from its original setting. There was nothing associated with it to suggest an exotic nature or an exotic origin; it appeared to me to be a component of some terrestrial, technical ar- tifact.\" P rof. Moore also faxed me a suggestion he had re- ceived via E-mail from David Thomas, vice presi- dent of the non-profit group, \"New Mexicans for Science and Reason.\" Dave is a New Mexico Tech graduate now working for a scientific company in Albuquerque. He suggests an isotopic analysis. \"For example, the earthly ratios for the common isotopes of copper are 69.09% (Cu-63) and 30.91 % (Cu-65). These would probably be different for Cu not from our own so- lar system.\" The expanded explanation for isotopic analysis is provided by Prof. Moore in the following two paragraphs. \"Dave's idea is a good one, well worth pursuing be- cause isotopic analysis might determine if the copper in the fragment has a different isotopic composition than that of terrestrial copper. The rationale: The ratio of copper 63 to copper 65 was probably determined by processes in the supernova that blew up more than 5 bil- lion years ago and produced the nebula from which the solar system formed. It is unlikely that the same exact ra- tio would have been produced in another star. Therefore, if the ratio of copper isotopes in the fragment is different than the terrestrial ratio, it is possible that the fragment had an 'extra-solar system' origin. On the other hand, if the fragment ratio is the same as the terrestrial ratio, an origin outside the solar system is not completely ruled out: it is merely less likely. \"Isotopic analysis involves use of a mass spectrome- ter in which a very small portion of the sample is va- porized and ionized in a vacuum; the ions are then ac- celerated in an electric field before passing into a region with a transverse magnetic field which deflects the mov- ing ions into a curved path. The radius of each ion's path depends on the charge-to-mass ratio for that ion, the strength of the magnetic field and velocity of the ion. By adjusting the ion velocity or the strength of the magnetic field, it is possible to make ions having a given mass land on a target where they can be counted. When the numbers of ions in each class of ion mass are counted as PAGE 14 NUMBER 338 JUNE 1996"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Precedents set in UFO debris history indi- cate a cautionary stance be taken to pro- vide protective custody of the fragment.

MAY 15, 1996 UPDATE Three weeks had crept by with no communication from Dr. Marcel regarding his evaluation of the fragment photos. A telephone call to him on April 16th deter- mined that not only had he not received the fragment photos, but the whole fragment story was news to him. I quickly assembled and mailed a packet of news clip- pings, photos and a copy of the fragment story I'd writ- ten for publication. Upon receipt of the packet, Dr. Marcel called and for the record made the following statement: \"The materials I held in my hands in 1947 were alu- minum in color, and there was no evidence of a copper substratum. Based on the known weight and physical di- mensions of the fragment, the materials I remember holding were lighter in weight. \"Before the conversation ended Dr. Marcel also rec- ommended the Isotopic Analysis to determine the frag- ment's terrestrial or extraterrestrial origin. The UFO Museum has received a number of dubious offers to \"help\" do further analysis of an undisclosed na- ture, one of which requires 14 days to complete.

Driving to a friend's house in a rural area, two men observed two points of light circling south of them, fly- ing at an altitude of about 2.500 feet. The lights turned northward and headed toward the men and displayed an additional two lights, blinking like strobes. The four main lights were in front, leading the strobe lights. The men thought they could distinguish a structure con- necting the lights, a circle about 100 yards in diameter, with dark rings on the bottom. The men could still see the object getting closer when they reached their destination, and one of them went into the house to summon two more witnesses. The four witnesses then stood in the driveway to watch the craft approach and could hear a moderately-pitched hum- ming from it. The object went slowly over their heads, and, as it did, the strobe lights switched off. It turned westward, without banking, in the direction of Whitman Air Force Base. When it was about half a mile away, three of the men saw between six and eight points of bright, white lights fly out of the craft's bottom side and \"buzz around like bees.\" The craft and its expelled lights continued westward until out of sight.

A woman and her two pre-teen boys were driving homeward, north on a farm road between Highway 26 and Highway 127 when they saw three very bright lights above the road ahead of them. The lights were on char- coal-colored triangular crafts flying in formation at tree- top level, apparently having just crossed westward over the road. They seemed to be hovering over a farmer's cow pen, then turned southward parallel to the road and headed toward the witnesses, going no more than five miles per hour. For four minutes, the objects were very close. The woman believed the aircraft to be U.S.-owned, until they were very close. She then realized they did not look like anything she had ever heard of. Each craft was triangular, with an ellipsoid fuselage below the \"wing\" and two smaller ellipsoid canisters on each side, separated from the fuselage. Toward the rear of the fuselage was a rectangular area that appeared to contain a fan and a bluish-green light. \"Take the Stealth Fighter ... Smash it flatter on top. Remove all edges, all sharp corners. Remove all windows. Put a huge headlight on it, and you'll have something close.\" The \"headlights\" were too bright to look directly into. They were \"bright enough to shine across the entire state of Washington.\" The structures appeared to be over 20 feet long and made of fiberglass, or similar, not metal. First thinking the aerial objects were of U.S. origin, the woman remained calm, but her sons were both afraid. The younger of the two exclaimed, \"Step on it! Let's get the hell out of here!\" He looked down and away from the objects while his older brother, shaking in fear, stretched his torso out the window to get a better look. They heard a humming sound. The three triangles continued gliding almost silently southward to Highway 26, then turned'westward just north and parallel to the highway. They continued their path by the highway for the remainder of time the three witnesses watched. When the witnesses turned onto an- other road, three miles from their home, they lost sight of the objects.

These two reports are being presented together be- cause the second referred to the first as possibly being a sighting of the same object. A man and woman were sitting on their balcony one clear evening in December, when the woman became aware of a strange, red-orange glowing light crossing the sky, coming from the north. She alerted the man, and both watched a round light move through the sky at a speed slower than most jet air- craft. The object was only about 1,000 feet high, but they could not clearly distinguish a shape beyond the bright orange light. At its nearest point, the man thought the object was flat, \"like a plate.\" It became very bright, and all the man could then see was \"a ball of light in the air.\" The aspirin size at arm's length translated to an ob- ject having a diameter of about 15 feet. They called their neighbor, who also saw the light, ex- claiming, \"Oh, my God!\" The neighbor, who later re- fused an interview, claimed he saw the object cross the Continued on Page IS PAGE 16 NUMBER 338 JUNE 1996"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL HIGH STRANGENESS: UFOs FROM 1960 THROUGH 1979 Volume 3 of The UFO Encyclopedia by Jerome Clark Omnigraphics, 1996, hb, 777 plus xxviii pp., $95 (vol. 1, UFOs in the 1980s, 1990, vol. 2, The Emergence of a Phenomenon: UFOs from the Beginning through 1959, 1992, $95 each; complete 3-volume set, $228) * Reviewed by Karl T. Pflock I n 1989, Jerry Clark set out to create an encyclopedic chronicle of the UFO phenomenon in all its as- pects—the theories, the organizations, the personal- ities, the actions and reactions of government and media, the effects on and of popular culture, the hoaxes, the saucer-spawned religious and mystical movements, the so-called skeptics, and, first and foremost, whatever it is that inspired and continues to inspire it all: UFOs. High Strangeness, the third and final volume of Clark's Herculean undertaking, was three years in the research and writing and, to this reviewer's thinking, worth every minute of it and more. With its completion, Clark, the UFO phenomenon's Boswell, has succeeded in what he set out to do seven years ago. He has given us the UFO reference work. Yet the task is not complete. As this is written, Clark is at work on a revised, updated, and expanded om- nibus edition of his encyclopedia, an enterprise which will keep its author happily busy if not out of trouble, and when completed will, of course, require revision, up- dating, and expansion. At some point, Clark surely will wonder if his name should not be Sisyphus. If so, I hope Jerry will take heart in the knowledge that, while like the Underworld's legendary toiler, his work will never be done, unlike that unhappy soul, his labors will have been and continue to be enormously productive and important. Like its companion volumes, High Strangeness is remarkably rich in information and ideas and, in the bargain, marvelously written. No mere compendium of dry data, it is an intellectually meaty and thought-pro- voking smorgasbord. Included are numerous detailed histories of important cases, both well- and not-so-well- known, several lengthy, thoughtful, and informative es- says (including two contributed by Australian UFO re- searcher Bill Chalker and one each by Drs. Michael D. Swords and Thomas E. Bullard), and five insightful bi- ographical profiles of researchers who made their mark on our field during the \"ufologically\" (and otherwise) turbulent sixties and seventies—Ray Fowler, Walt Webb, Allan Hendry, Lou Parish, and the late Dr. James E. McDonald, to whose memory High Strangeness is ded- icated. From Ashtar and The Two through the UMMO hoax, the Barney and Betty Hill abduction, MIBs, Travis Walton's tale, voyagers from and to Lanulos, UFOCAT, Pascagoula \"claw men,\" Socorro (and more), saucers crashed and retrieved, Falcon Lake, the AAAS UFO symposium and the AIAA UFO Subcommittee, Cisco Grove, sex and (and in) UFOs. the Condon Committee, ultraterrestrials, and CEs 1-3, to science and the ex- traterrestrial hypothesis and occult theories of UFO ori- gins, it is all here. Mirroring the comprehensive range of topics, the source lists which accompany the entries in- clude not only the sources cited, but also related mater- ial for further reference. Moreover, included are exten- sive cross-references, not only internal but to all vol- umes, a cumulative index covering all subjects, peo- ple, and organizations discussed in the Encyclopedia, an alphabetical listing of all entries appearing in the entire 3-volume set, and—this alone is worth the price of ad- mission—a bibliography listing every source used in all three volumes. Clark puts this more than a little bewildering spec- trum of reported fabulous experience, physical evi- dence, and dueling interpretations into much needed perspective in his introductory essay, the bland title of which, \"The UFO Phenomenon: A Historical Overview,\" belies its philosophical significance. Discussing the difficulties besetting those of us who seek to understand and explain the disparate array of phenomenologies which have been tucked, coaxed, and dragged under the big top labeled \"UFO,\" Clark writes: \"We lack the vocabulary that would permit us to dis- cuss these matters with precision. We do possess the technical tools to judge and value the meaning of phys- ical evidence.... Yet we cannot always explain how something that seems entirely real on an experience level may not be real on an event level.... Both rationalist and magical 'explanations' only beg the question, pre- suming to knowledge not currently available to us.... \"...We would all be better off if, when the occasion called for it, we pretended to no false authority but in- stead boldly uttered three one-syllable words seldom heard in the five decades of the UFO controversy: We don't know.\" He goes on to note that, \"except in those instances where good reason exists to doubt an informant's sin- cerity,\" he proceeds in this work \"on the assumption that intellectual agnosticism, rather than its alternatives (oc- cultism on one hand, reduction-ism on the other) is the wisest course.\" Sound advice, and where fault can be found with High Strangeness, it is in those instances in which the author did not heed his own counsel.

There are also instances in which an understandable enthusiasm to skewer the \"it can't be, therefore it isn't\" crowd, or to advance a particular cause, leads to a bit of verbal finagling. Here are two examples. In his account of the famous April, 1966, Portage County, Ohio, UFO chase, Clark states, \"Ufology of any sort...is, in [UFO 'skeptic' Robert] Sheaffer's estimation (and his italics), 'fundamentally a reaction against science and rea- son..'\" Sheaffer's words were lifted out of context from this sentence in his book, The UFO Verdict (p. 237): \"Thus we can see that UFOlogy as a powerful so- cial movement [my emphasis] is fundamentally a re- action against science and reason.\" A rather different statement. In his otherwise outstanding introductory essay, Clark states with reference to the Roswell incident that the General Accounting Office found \"that all official records of the event are missing.\" In fact, the GAO located two official records of the incident, both long known to pri- vate UFO researchers. It also discovered that the dispo- sition form covering the destruction of several years' worth of Roswell Army Air Field records, which may have included documents containing information about the Roswell case, lacked a required notation citing the au- thority under which the disposal action had been taken. According to the chief archivist of the National Personnel Records Center, this was the case with numerous Air Force organizational records from the same time period. (See p. 4 of the GAO report, \"Results of a Search for Records Concerning the 1947 Crash Near Roswell, New Mexico,\" GAO/NSIAD-95-187, July 1995.) Not quite the same thing as Roswell-incident records known to have existed having gone missing. But, then, Sisyphus stumbled more than once on his repeated trips up the mountain, and Boswell all too often favored Dr. Johnson in his recountings of his mentor's words and deeds. Unlike these two figures, Jerry Clark has the opportunity to hew more closely to his own sage advice as he tackles the omnibus volume now in the making. Meanwhile, High Strangeness and its sister volumes unequivocally are \"must haves\" for both seri- ous students of UFOs and institutional reference col- lections in need of a reliable, comprehensive, and ac- cessible reference to the UFO mystery in all its strange- ness, high and low. Karl Pflock, writer and long-time UFO researcher, is the author of The Roswell UFO Mystery: Legend and Reality, forthcoming (1997) CASES - Continued from page 16 moon and could make out \"serrated edges, with a point on top.\" After the object passed beyond the trees to the south, the woman called the local airports while the man got out his VCR. Both hoped the object would return, and it, or another, did. The observed object was like, and trav- eled\\in the same direction as, the object in the first sighting, but about half again as high. They offered their video of this second sighting to the local CBS TV station, and it was aired on December 29 and 30. The investigator received several calls after the TV airing of the video, from others who had seen the same object. One call regarded a similar sighting five months earlier, on Independence Day, involving four witnesses. The main witness was called outside by his friends, to see a disc-shaped, orange object traveling about 200 m.p.h. at an altitude of 4,000-5,000 feet. It was about one-fourth the size of the moon, which translates to a di- ameter of about 30 feet. The color was described as \"neon orange\" by one and \"crayon orange\" by another of the witnesses. The object vibrated or quivered, making the image unclear. They said the light was definitely not part of the fireworks in the area, and the main witness could not detect any navigation lights.  ' The group continued watching until the object dis- appeared on the horizon, over the Everglades, southwest of them. If anyone sees a 'V\"-shaped object with one arm much shorter than the other and possibly moving with the apex at the rear, take note. So far, we have had three reports regarding such a \"vehicle,\" one showing up in Florida, another in Indiana, and the third in Virginia. Two were in April 1993 and the third in January 1994.

In an ar- ticle by Bernard Haisch, Ph.D., that gave ufologists a good outline of what should be considered when con- ducting investigations and research, Haisch states: \"Evidence needs to be properly analyzed and then prop- erly presented using techniques and values as close as possible to those of mainstream science.\" 1 I whole- heartedly concur with Haisch. Many ufologists seem to be too eager not to con- duct good scientific and analytical follow through. Some ufologists find it much easier to write off what they can't explain and to put it under the umbrella of para- normal activity, a red flag to mainstream scientists, when ufologists do not use accepted scientific tech- niques. Skeptics like Phil Klass and Carl Sagan have the right to criticize them. We, as ufologists, must act and present in a professional setting. If we don't, we lose all credibility in the eyes of the scientific community. Many ufologists often get involved with the me- dia/entertainment element and at times receive good publicity and then get careless with their judgment. Case in point: Budd Hopkins and Dr. John Mack, and their experience with television shows dealing with UFOs and the paranormal. Both men received favorable press from the TV series Sightings which involved their hypnosis regression of abductees. Now, Sightings has left a question mark on ufology in some instances by portraying some of the subjects on their show in less than favorable circumstances. In some cases, the subjects are not prepared or are less knowledgeable on the sub- ject matter than they admit. Then along comes the TV series Nova which led Hopkins down the primrose path by creative editing of his hypnosis sessions. This type of bait and switch scheme has been around for years with the entertainment/information media. On the popular TV show X-Files, one episode made the hypnotist who was regressing a female abductee look like the original Svengali, a technique right out of a class-B movie. William Paul Cone, Ph.D., states the following con- cerning hypnotic regression: \"Most often, they (ab- ductees) are misinformed and told that hypnosis can accurately recover hidden memories. The fantasies re- covered during the session are then believed to be real, and the patient is traumatized by what he has remem- bered.\" 2 Cone was hypothesizing that the experiencers may be paranoid. Unfortunately, many people today have about the same understanding of hypnosis as many did in Franz A. Mesmer's day. There are far too many people in the world who associate hypnosis with the occult and para- normal, along with hypnotists willing to oblige these ideas. With the proliferation of specialty schools turning out certified hypnotherapists with minimal or no re- quirements and governing laws, the need for controlled scientific procedures involving hypnotic regression is imperative for credibility. I have had many conversations with certified hypnotherapists who are not in the medical or mental health care fields, and who have little or no ad- vanced education. In many instances, they have no knowledge of crucial aspects concerning the possible psychological adverse affects of hypnosis. We who use hypnosis for memory recall must un- derstand that False Memory Syndrome (FMS) does ex- ist and that leading questioning, even for test purposes, can induce a false memory in some cases. I wrote my dissertation on FMS in association with the use of hyp- nosis, which gives me some understanding of the affects of hypnosis on humans. The more occasions that hyp- nosis is used to recall a specific memory, the more real and vivid that memory becomes, accurate or not. False memories can be created in young children without the use of hypnosis. Hypnosis enhances imagery, and very young children have very active imaginations and a great capacity for fantasy. Because of these factors, it is recommended that hypnosis for memory recall not be used with this particular group. Those of us who practice Hypnotherapy must keep our sights and goals on professional and scientific pro- cedures when working with clients involved in UFO events. The hypnotherapist must inform the client of the possibility of adverse affects in the use of hypnosis by using a client consent form, audio/video taping each session, and following an outline for the intended re- gression procedure in order to avoid leading the client in any way to a desired outcome. The audio/video tape and consent form are the hypnotist's assurance of not being creatively edited for entertainment purposes. Hypnosis remains a powerful and useful tool when used by pro- fessional and knowledgeable people. If we as ufologists are to become more credible and professional, we have to be open in what we do, even to constructive criticism by skeptics. Who knows, in time, they may even take a positive interest in our work. 1.

Saturn (0.8), near the Pisces-Cetus border, rises in the E about 11:30 PM (midmonth). The ringed world starts retro- grade, or westward, motion on the 20th.

Dade and Polk Counties; and Floyd N. Petri, Jr. (Chester. TX) for Tyler, Jasper, Newton and Hardin counties. NEW CONSULTANTS New Consultants volunteering this past month were Robert B. Tyler, J.D.

SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS COVER DESIGN CONTEST The artistic abilities of Journal readers was evident, based upon the many submissions for the cover design of the MUFON 1996 International UFO Symposium Proceedings. We are very proud to announce that the winner for 1996 was Fran Geremia in Rye, NH, the wife of the New Hampshire State Director Peter Geremia. Her very attractive and appropriate artistic rendition will be printed in burgundy colored ink on an ivory leatherette cover stock. Fran will be the recip- ient of a $100 cash award plus $100 worth of MUFON publications of her choice, or should I say Pete's choice. We want to publicly thank all of those people who used their art talents and unique ideas for their proposed cover design renditions. The large number of ideas sub- mitted and interest shown certainly warrants another contest in 1997. Thanks again. MUFON MOTTO CONTEST By the time that you receive this issue of the Journal, the deadline for the motto contest of June 1, 1996 will have arrived. The response to the motto contest has been overwhelming not only in the number submitted, but the enthusiasm generated. To date, the number is ap- proaching one thousand, with some people submitting one or two pages of suggested ideas for a MUFON motto. Now the difficult job starts, when the judges must sit down and sort through the hundreds of significant pro- posals to select a winner. We are not only looking for a \"catchy\" motto, but one that truly depicts the goals and objectives of the Mutual UFO Network. The winner of the motto contest will be announced in a future issue of the Journal. We thank all of you who put on your \"thinking caps' and submitted entries. This has been the largest response that we have ever received to a MUFON promotion. FIELD INVESTIGATOR'S EXAMS Anyone who has purchased and studied the 4th edition of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual is eligible to take the exam via mail when they feel they are ready. The 100-question test may be secured from MUFON headquarters in Seguin and returned to this office for grading. In localities where field investigator training classes are being conducted, the instructor may order sufficient quantities of the test and administer the exam at the completion of the training classes. For current members, the new manual may be purchased for $25 plus $3.50 for postage and handling from MUFON in Seguin. MUFON NATIONAL UFO HOTLINE MUFON has been introducing its National UFO Hotline 1-800-UFO-2166 or 1-800-836-2166 to the public. Designed to obtain UFO sighting reports from police agencies nationwide, we are now prepared to expand its coverage. All State Directors were advised by a letter nearly a year ago to utilize this number for filing hot UFO cases that came to their attention. A letter an- nouncing the 800 number was mailed to all sheriff's of- fices and police chiefs in Texas during the spring of 1995 as a means of testing and evaluating the effective- ness of the system. The majority of our calls, to-date, have been from people who called the 800 directory and asked for \"UFO\" to report sightings or to seek UFO information. To send letters to every police department and sher- iff's office throughout the U.S.A. would obviously be both expensive and time-consuming. We would like for every State Director, State Section Director, Field Investigator, and Field Investigator Trainee to notify your local sheriff, police chief, and state highway patrol office of MUFON's 800 number via a postcard that they may post on their bulletin boards or at the dis- patcher's desk. Presently, we are attempting to answer all calls \"live.\" An answering box records the calls received late at night or early mornings. These sighting reports will be mailed or telephoned to the nearest State Section Director, State Director, or Field Investigator for a per- sonal interview. Brief replies to these cases under in- vestigation may be made to MUFON on the 800 num- ber. (The answering box is limited to three minutes.) However, this number is not to be used for other MU- FON communications. The MUFON business office number is (210) 379-9216. Please advise Walt Andrus by postcard or letter to which agencies you filed the UFO hotline number 1-800-UFO-2166. We thank each and everyone of you who advised MUFON this month that you had made the 800 UFO hotline number avail- able to police agencies in your immediate area.

Since both videotaping and audiotaping have been contracted to private firms as a service to attendees, flash cameras, videotaping, and audiotaping will not be permitted in the auditorium. UFO AWARENESS WEEK Director of Public Education Virginia M. Tilly, has announced that the Annual UFO Awareness Week will be conducted from August 10 through 18, 1996. Mary Kerfoot in Chicago and Tom Taylor in Phoenix, AZ received national news coverage last year for their exhibits and programs. This is a major project in MUFON's public education program. In order to get space in local shopping malls for your planned dis- plays and video presentations, it is imperative that you reserve the necessary facilities immediately, if you have not already done so. Closed circuit UFO video programs are very effective in conjunction with UFO exhibit boards and informational handouts about MUFON. Start making your plans now. You will find that the experience gained is very rewarding by shar- ing our mutual avocation. NEW OFFICERS Former Assistant State Director, Dana M. Schmidt. J.D. (Rochester.
