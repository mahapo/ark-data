Perh~ps now we cen unders't~nd, Cr, Utke points out; why we.'rc on the merry-go-round we zre with re- gard to UFOs. Most sci&nti'sts simply f.eel th~t it's \"imnossib>e\" that UFOs exist and 'could be either 2 ncw n2tur~l phenomenon or extra-terre7 trial sin orig:n, If theyiwere one of these things, we'd have to deny, revise, or even disc2rd some of our mz jor .theories about t,ime, space, matter, the atmosphere et'c! Obviously it's much e~sier simply to deny tb t UFOs exist , .ignore them, or exclain them away unti 1 such time * as there is overwhelming \"scientific: prooffT e.vail~\\le th~t forces us to belicve them. . - How ,are we going .to pet off this merry-go-roimd?. Unfortunately, we .prob?bly won't, Dr. Utlte says, until meny scientists chenge smc of their attitudes.. For example, maybe it's time we made our criteria for \"scientific proof\" a little less stiff and rigid zt times. Th-9 circumstanti~l evidence for meteories 2nd ball lightning wps overwhelm- ing. But \"scientific proof\" was lscking and so sightings of tbe things -were a lmcs t completely ignored for mmy years; Likewise, t.he circumstm 'tial evidence that UFOs exist is strong enough t-o get .a conviction by t'he rules applied in .my criminsl- or civil !court of law. The time has-- come to seriousLy consid'er this ~vidence in a scientific court of law,' ' Do we have -to, a1wey.s either-be believcrs,or non-believers in things. Can't we be curious skeptics?. Along these lines-,. Dr. Utke states his.-belie3 that it is time rcre scientists' balance their excessive emphasis on wh? t is known with a little ma- e respect for the idea thzt ther,e may be mzny slgnific i.1~ thlngs yet to be discovered. This would lead to a little more inte3 l ect- ual curiosity zbout the unknown.
