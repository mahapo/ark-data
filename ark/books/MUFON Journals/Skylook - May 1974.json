The desirability of a world-wide network of UFO researchers has been emphasized many times. The most important reason for such a network, of course, is the need to exchange information re- garding sightings and research. And while .com- paratively few persons interested in UFO's have the opportunity of visiting their counterparts overseas, the possibility of personal contacts in foreign countries should not be overlooked. One such visit was arranged for Dr. J. Allen Hynek by Harold H. Fulton, MUFON director for New Zealand, in September of 1973. Fulton checked with the four New Zealand UFO groups for their reactions, then set about working out a travel schedule. The anticipated one-week visit turned out to be only half that, since Dr. Hynek also wanted to stop in New Guinea, American Samoa, and Australia. Even so, plans were made to provide the type of fact-finding tour of New Zealand which Dr. Hynek originally had in mind. Led by MUFON Field Investigator Bruce Harding, a six-man team set up a three-hour stopover for Dr. Hynek in Christchurch, which was covered ex- tensively by the media. With four others, Fulton met Dr. Hynek at Wellington Airport, where again there was coverage by the media. From there Dr. Hynek was taken to the home of MUFON Field In- vestigator Drew Kefelas, which became the center for the visitor's 25-hour stay in Wellington. Witnesses to UFO sightings were brought to the Kefelas home by Kefelas and MUFON Field Investi- gator Kevin Drake. Paul Norman, public relations officer of the Victorian UFO Research Group, hap- pened to be in Wellington, so he was invited to meet with Dr. Hynek, and Fulton expresses hope that the visit renewed liaison with Victoria. From Wellington, Dr. Hynek went to Aukland, where Henk J. Hinfelaar acted as his host. Again, Dr. Hynek was afforded the opportunity of talking with witnesses to UFO sightings. Also on hand was Tony Brunt, who had founded the Aukland Univer- sity UFO Research Group. Fulton reports that Dr. Hynek had the oppor- tunity of talking with witnesses to some first class sightings during his visit, including a daylight sighting by six adult witnesses exterd- ing over an hour. The extensive press coverage of Dr. Hynek tended to bring out additional re- ports, according to Fulton. This visit by Dr. Hynek illustrates the poten- tial for combining travel with UFO research. While most of us do not carry the credentials or fame of a - : Dr. Hynek, many Skylook readers do fit into the category of serious UFO researchers, and thus would be welcomed by their counterparts overseas. Likewise, most of us would be more than willing to host our friends from other countries. Such visits could add a great deal of knowledge and enjoyment to our somewhat unique avocation."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Director's Message By Walt Andrus Professor E. J.

Allen Hynek of Northwestern University told an audience of about 150 on March 3 at Mc- Kendree College, Lebanon, 111., that interest In UFO'a ia at an all-tine high. Disclaiming any political allusions or in- sinuations, he observed that when one compares several recent Gallup polls, one sees that more people today believe in UFO's than believe In President Nixon. As he has done frequently. Dr. Hynek Illus- trated his talk with slides and cartoons, point- ing out the persistent ridicule with which the cartoonists have approached the UFO phenomenon, and distinguishing six basic categories of UFO reports. Dr. Hynek mentioned one occupant report which apparently has not been publicized yet in any of the UFO literature, possibly because the witness- es have asked for anonymity. He also described this sighting In a speech made at Stanford Uni- versity in February. The sighting was as follows: \"This one occurred about two months ago in New Hampshire,\" said Dr. Hynek. \"This man and his wife had just gone to bed when the man saw a light coming under the door.* He got up, turned the light off in the living room, and found that the living room was dark and the light was coming from the outside. He had a dog which was rather vicious. (In fact, when our Investigator went there, the dog wouldn't let him through until he was called off.) The man went to the door, opened it, and found that the illumination was coming In from outside In the region of these two creatures (a slide is projected on the screen showing a line drawing of two humanolds)i The dog rushed out, got half way to the creatures, stopped short, his hair bristled and stood on end, and he came cringing back to the house. And what do you suppose those creatures were doing? They were picking up rocks and putting them into a bag. This case had only two witnesses. It never hit the papers, and the people simply didn't want their names used at all.\" Dr. Hynek was quoted in a recent press release that he doesn't have a theory abcut what UFO's are. \"I don't necessarily believe that we are being visited,\" he said. la a recent issue of Family Weekly, Dr. Hynek was asked, \"When you were In charge of the Air Force's UFO inquiry, you rejected the existence of UFO's. Now you verify the experience of two men In Mississippi who say three creatures spirited them aboard a flying saucer. What gives?\" Dr. Hynek replied* VI did examine these men under hypnosis, and have stated their experience was very real. I have not changed my mind about apace visitors. But I have changed my mind about UFO's being simple misper- ceptions of common things. I am now quite con- vinced that we do have a very real and as yet un- explained phenomenon going on. I believe people who report UFO'a are sincere, and I, for one. cannot explain many of the things they describe. We must, however, remember that the \"U\" in UFO simply means \"unidentified\"—not necessarily vis- itors from outer space.\" Following his talk at McKendree College, he and MUFON secretary Ted Phillips answered questions from the audience. Concerning speculation regard- Ing UFO's and the ETI (extraterrestrial Intelli- gence) hypothesis, Dr. Hynek commented, \"UFO's are a real phenomenon, but this 'visitation from outside earth' may not be an explanation....Sup- pose— and I say this as pure imagination—suppose a thought-form can be projected elsewhere and have it materialize there—sort of 'beamed down' a la 'Star Trek 1 ? Or, another possibility is: how do we know that the things that we see around us represent the sum total of our environment? Kay- be, as some mystics and other people have told us for centuries, there are other planes of exist- ence....\" When asked if he thinks the USAF or other gov- ernment agency is withholding information on UFO's, he replied, \"I would have to say that I think so. Because I know that while I was a part of Blue Book, there were a number of cases that never got into Blue Book....It does seem unlikely that, as active as this government is in all sorts of investigations, that this wouldn't be being touched by somebody.\" Bringing the evening to a close, Dr. Hynek men- tioned an upcoming NBC White Paper on UFO's, which he Is working on. It Is to be aired in Sep- tember in prime time, with Rod Serling as the narrator. \"So at long last, I'm becoming a Holly- wood star,\" he quipped. \"We're getting some very Interesting things from NASA, and, believe it or not, from the Air Force as well. It's going to be a blockbuster.\" Dr. Hynek's book, \"The UFO Experience,\" which has become one of the most widely-accepted publi- cations on the subject, will be released in paperback in May by Ballantlne.

The two estimated that the object was one-half to three-fourths of a mile a- way, and about 800 feet above the ground. Conejo photo similar to others In an adjoining article, Adrian Vance analyses a photo reportedly taken by two Conejo, Calif., youths on Feb. 8, 1973. Following is an account of the incident from the March 20, 1973, Thousand Oaks, Calif., News-Chronicle. The two youths, Richard Coimbra and Kurt Huet- tner, both 15, were reportedly shooting still photos for a class project when they noticed the object. Prior to sighting the object, they had seen commercial planes in ' the vicinity, and at first thought the object was a plane. One of the boys reported that the object \"was silent.\" There was \"no hum flame, or smoke, and it looked to be rotating. We saw it for about 30 seconds, then it went behind the trees and clouds and out'of view.\" They estimate that it was about 800 feet in the air, and perhaps a half to three-fourths of a mile away. Huettner estimated the diameter of the object at about 70 feet. Both said the object speculated that it was some kind of device being tested by the government, but Coimbra thought that intelligent life from some other galaxy mighty have been piloting the craft. Seven months earlier, in the summer of 1972, two 14-year-old boys, strangers to Huettner and Coimbra, reported a similar sighting in the same general area, according to the News-Chronicle. The youths, who wish to remain anonymous (Skylook does not know their identities), were reportedly camping in the back yard at one of their homes one night when they saw someting \"half round and very bright with 'three diamond-shaped things on it.\" These were \"pretty big\" and brighter than the rest of the object. \"It went too fast to be a jet,\" one of the boys said, \"and it made no noise.\" He described it as looking flat-surfaced, then taking on a saucer shape when it banked. He added that a light seemed to be coming from it, and also advancing before it. The other youth said, \"It was large and either grey or silver. There was no moon, but we could see it pretty good with the binoculars.\" He added that it was flying pretty high and glid- ing effortlessly, and making no noise. The fam- ily of one of the boys reportedly sat up for five or six evenings watching in the same general di- rection, but without success."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Conejo photo: as analysis On Feb. 8, 1973, at 4:45 p.m. two 15-year-old youths observed and took a picture of a UFO with a Polaroid \"Square Shooter\" camera near Conejo, Calif. The young men estimated that the object was a>out 800 feet in the air and one-half to three-quarters of a mile from their position. The UFO appears to be a domed disc, tilted slightly with a bright light emanating from a large area or port on the bottom of the vehicle. Examination of the print shows that the image is almost exactly two millimeters in width. Inas- much as the camera has a focal lenght of 114 mm we can use the ratio of 2/114 to estimate the UFO's diameter if we can determine the object distance. Lieutenant Colonel R.F. Bowker, United States Air Force Retired, investigated the sight- ing for MUFON and determined that the tree seen in the picture was 96 feet from the camera posi- tion. The image of the tree is very crisp and the portion of sky that was photographed shows high level cloud formations with very little ground haze. The quality of the UFO image.is such that we conclude that it was no less than 1000 feet from the camera and probably more like 2000 to 3000 feet quoted by the young men. At 1000 feet the UFO would have a diameter of 18 feet, at a distance of 2000 feet its diameter would be 36 feet and at 3000 feet the object would be 54 feet in diameter. We favor the 2000 foot estimate with the UFO's diameter on the order of 30 feet. The image indicates that the object is rather flat on the. bottom and if we make such an as- sumption the oblate appearance of the image can be used to determine the degree of tilt. If the dome-like top is excluded, measurements of an enlargement provided by Colonel Bowker indicate that the oblateness is in the ratio 13/31, or 0.238, which is the sine of 14°, the degree of tilt. This is a shallow degree of tilt and it appears that if we could tip the object to ver- tical the aspect ratio, including the upper dome, would be about 1:4, heighth to width. In addi- tion, the undersides would appear to curve down- ward slightly to the light-emitting port, or panel, which includes one-third of the underside diameter. The area of the port, or panel, ap- pears to be flat or open and described only by the outer ring of the vehicle itself. The object bears considerable similarity to the object photographed in Oregon on Nov. 22, 1966, by an anonymous biochemist. The analysis of that photograph was outlined in our own story \"The Oregon Photograph\" in PhotoGraphic Magazine, January, 1973. Both of these vehicles are possi- bly the same size, much the same shape, but dif- fer in color with the Conejo UFO appearing to have a silver top and the Oregon UFO having an observed \"gold\" or yellow upper surface.

The photo appears to be authentic, however, according to the findings of Mr. Vance. • . > • This photo, which bears some resemblance to the Conejo picture, was reportedly taken in March, 1967, by Augusta Arranda of Lima, Peru, while visiting a . friend at lungay in the Huascaran mountains. It was allegedly shot with a 40-year . old Voigt lander camera,, using color film. tiple image phenomenon seen in the Oregon Photo- graph, .but the observation suggests a much more casual cruising locomotion than the rapid escape pattern seen by the Oregon witness-photographer.

Mem- bers of the Sowell family had kept quiet about what they had seen on a Louisiana farm on Jan. 1, 1951, until the recent flap and the attendant discussion by scientists. In an article in the Feb. 5, 1974, Huntsville, Alabama, Times, science writer Barry J. Casebolt tells the long-delayed story, based on an inter- view with Mrs. Katie Sowell, a medical secretary, who now lives in Huntsville. -At the time of the reported sighting she had been visiting relatives while her husband, who is a pilot and a retired Department of Defense employee, was out of state. At about 7 a.m. on the morning of Jan. 1, 1951, on a farm near Oak Grove, La., her brother- in-law, who operated the farm, ran back into the house, very excited, and \"told everybody to get up and outside in a hurry,\" Mrs. Sowell recalls. \"He said there was a flying saucer out there... between the barn and the house.\" About a dozen people ran out of the house to see the craft as it \"swooooooshed\" from west to east, turning counterclockwise as it moved over nearby trees about one-fourth mile from, the' house. \"It was going on a straight course, from west to east,\" stated Mrs. Sowell, \"It was going at a very slow rate of speed, and it sort of dar- ted instead of moving steadily.\" The sky was described as being clear and blue,' there was no fog or haze, and the sun was up over the horizon. The' family watched the craft for 15 to 20 minutes, as it darted around the farm. Finally, it banked and \"just disappeared straight up. It was completely out of sight for a second or two,\" said Mrs. Sowell. At one point the craft altered its course to move past the house, enabling the witnesses to see the top, bottom, and side of the object. . Windows, apparently not- transparent, were sandwiched between the two upside saucers, ac- cording to Mrs. Sowell.

Under the monitoring project, expected to be- gin early in April, 15 of the new devices will be positioned in Southern California. When a UFO is detected on one or more of the magnetometers , the group will then try to correlate this \"sensing\" with visual sightings. A 16th magnetometer, according to Herr, will soon be shipped to Marseille, France, where num- erous sightings have been reported. ********* For those interested in Friedman's Schedule, his itinerary (as of March 27) nished here: lecture is fur- May 4 Calif.

Blumrich (Bantam Books, 1974, 179 pp., $1.95), is reviewed by Barry H. Downing, pastor of Northminster Pres- byterian Church, Endwell, New York, MUFON Relig- ion Consultant.  • . By Dr. Barry Downing Since Josef F. Blumrich is a NASA rocket de- signer, it is not surprising that he has recently applied for a patent for a new type of wheel sys- tem for space vehicle landing gear. His new wheel will give a space vehicle total mobility on the ground without requiring the wheels to change di- rection.. His system involves placing something like small barrels on the rim of the main wheel. These barrels . can rotate at variable speed in either direction, independent of the main wheel rim on which they are mounted. This main wheel rim also has independent speed and rotation di- rection control. By controlling the direction and speed of rotation of both the wheel and the barrels, the space vehicle riding on these wheels can move in any desired direction. While .it is not surprising that Blumrich should develop an idea such as this, it is surprising that his invention was inspired by the \"wheel within a wheel\".of Ezekiel, as he explains in his new book The Spaceships of Ezekiel. His theories were recently explored on the NBC TV documentary \"In Search of Ancient Mysteries.\" According to his exegesis of chapter 1 of Ezekiel, Blumrich believes vs. 4 describes the total space vehicle coming toward .Ezekiel as \"a great cloud, with brightness round about it, and fire flashing forth continually...as it were gleaming bronze. Ezekiel sees a metallic space ship with rockets biasing. Connected to this space vehicle are \"the likeness of four living creatures\" (vs.5), sometimes called the cherubim, which are the landing gear. The landing gear looks something like men, with mechanical arms attached to them which enable the craft to per- form a .soft landing. After the vehicle.lands, the helicopter \"wings\" drop to the side to avoid the heat of the rocket unit. The main space craft unit, referred to as the \"likeness of a firmament, like a shining crystal, spread out above their (the helicopter units) heads\" (vs. 22), according to Blumrich is shaped like a child's top. The part which you would grab to spin the \"top\" is the command module, perhaps made of transparent plastic revealing the pilot's seat; \"above the firmament over their heads there was the likeness of a throne, in ap- pearance like sapphire\" (vs.26). On the throne is, the likeness of a man, the commander, who .eventually talks,to Ezekiel. Blumrich explains the desirability of the \"top\" design as a space craft, including its natural braking ability while descending in the atmos- .phere. The'\"wheels\" of Ezekiel turn out not to be space craft as some others have suggested, but rather are real wheels attached to the four heli- copter units (the living creatures), which form part of the landing gear. As Ezekiel says, the unusual wheel construction which inspired Blumrich 1 s patent enabled the space vehicle to travel on the ground \"in- any of their four directions without turning as - they went\" (vs. 17). These are a few highlights of Blumrich's ex- egesis, .and I recommend that every serious UFO student examine this book carefully. Religious liberals, will not like Blumrich's work because it treats Ezekiel's \"vision\" too literally. Many conservatives will not like it either because it is too naturalistic. But Blumrich's work repre- sents one of the most convincing arguments so far that some, if not several, of the Biblical re- ports concerning contact between man and angels can be interpreted in light of our emerging^ space age technology. Certainly this approach does open a potential Pandora's box for religious leaders. Blumrich is an engineer, not a theologian, so .he does not try to deal with the religious impli- cations of his exergesis. Neither does he try to relate Ezekiel's UFO to the pillar of cloud of the Exodus, the chariot of fire of Elijah, nor the ascension cloud of Jesus. He has given an engineer .'s interpretation of what Ezekiel saw. But someday soon', the theological wheels have to start turning. Businessman reports UFO's SHENANDOAH, PA., EVENING HERALD, NOV. 24,'1973 --R. Michael DeLong, a Robesonia businessman, re- ported to police that on Nov. 19 he was driving south of Pottsville when he saw a \"V\" of five in- tense red lights speed over the horizon, heading toward Tumbling Run. \"It was pitching toward earth from 30 degrees off the horizon to the hor- izon,\" said DeLong, an experienced pilot. He estimated that the object or objects trav- eled at 400 to 500 miles per hour. Because of the intensity of the lights and the short dura- tion of the sighting, he said he could not tell if it was five separate objects flying in forma- tion, or. whether the five lights were connected somehow. He said he could not estimate the size of the objects, but thought they were about 2,000 feet high coming to the horizon. \"I know posit- feet high coming to the horizon. \"I know posi- tively that what I saw was nothing flying that I- am familiar with,\" -he concluded. 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"UFO's and creatures Pennsylvania sightings continue By Stan Gordon MUFON State Director, Pennsylvania The year 1974 has so far shown a decrease in UFO activity as compared to the previous year. The WCUFOSG which serves as a 24-hour statewide UFO clearing-house has investigated 57 UFO re- ports as of April 11, 1974. Many of the cases were found to have a logical explanation. The following are some of the more interesting cases that still are under investigation. Jan. 26-4 a.m., two adults parked in car were frightened by a round object the size of a barn, that swooped down in front of their parked car then rose up into the sky at terrific speed. The object had a flat top and ridges around the side which might have been windows. The car radio was on at the same time and it became filled with static until the object departed. This incident occurred on Rt. 66 outside of Greensburg. At 7:45 a.m. another similar UFO was observed by several witness near Trafford. r Jan. 27-2 a.m., a number of drivers on the Pa. Turnpike near Irwin reported to the toll booth operators that they had observed UFO's simultane- ously. A number of witnesses reported what look- ed like (2) bright car headlights moving through the sky in a descending fashion. A lone woman driver who would have been in the area where others saw the lights descend was in a near hys- terical mood when she reported that she had seen 2 bright lights like headlights in the sky to her left. She said they suddenly disappeared and in a few seconds they appeared parallel with her car. The lights were very bright and shining down on an angle towards the road. The lights appeared to be attached to a dark shape which al- so had red lights mounted on it. The object made no sound but managed to keep up easily with the car that was far exceeding the 60 mph turnpike speed limit. The woman said what frightened her most was the fact that as long as the .object would follow next to her car, her automobile would constantly lose power as if the car was go- ing to stall out. When the object departed her car operated normally. Jan. 28-10:30 p.m., Sewickley (Near Pittsburgh) two women reported observing a very large silver fuselage-shaped object descending to an altitude of about 150 feet above a group of trees before it moved out of sight. The object had a bright light in front and back, and there was also a red light in front. The object was about a \\ of a mile away and no sound was heard. One of the women is quite familiar with aircraft because of her husband's former occupation, and realizing that it was something unusual she called the con- trol center at Greater Pittsburgh Airport. She didn't mention UFO, she just wanted to know if there were any choppers in the area. She was told that there was a commercial jet on approach from a different direction which she could see, but there were no other aircraft in the area at that time. Feb. 6-Ohiopyle-At 10 p.m. two witnesses con- fronted a number of dark, hairy 7 to 8-foot tall ape-like creatures, walking upright like a man and having eyes of fire that glowed in total darkness. The creatures were seen at the same time a bright pulsating red light was seen hover- ing a short distance away. Animals including an Eskimo Spitz were shaking in their cages and wouldn't make a sound until following day. State Police at the scene were convinced the witnesses were sincere, and after seeing animal reactions they believed that something unusual did occur. Feb. 7-Laurelville-At 12:55 a.m. a man travel- ing between Woodale and Laurelville off of Rt. 982 saw a 30-foot disc-shaped object about 100 feet away and about 150 feet above a field. The object had red, green and blue lights on the bottom and had a solid white top. It made a hum- ming sound and there was a strong chemical smell in the area. Feb. 27-9:20 p. m. Uniontown State Police alerted UFO Control Center. A man in S. Union Twp. reported that he saw 2 bright lights in the sky that he at first took to be helicopters. Both lights were at low altitude. Suddenly one of .the lights disappeared. In a few seconds the light appeared to rest on the ground about h to a mile away. The light after about a minute disappeared from the ground and the light in the sky also vanished. State police dispatched 2 cars to the area to search, but nothing could be located. March 12-9:10 until 10:05 p.m. Small flap in about a 25-mile area of Greensburg. The first reports from Jeanette - indicated that a formation of 3 lights, consisting of two smaller white lights with the larger one below them were moving at a-low altitude over the tree tops and moving much too slowly for aircraft. The two smaller lights disappeared after about 3 minutes, and the larger light then moved east. Reports then came into UFO Control Center from residents in the Eastern sections of the county. A bright light as well as balls of blue lights were reported hovering near the Hempfield High School. State Police Troop A at Greensburg called UFO Control Center to confirm the reports, then dispatched 2 7 cars to the area. The objects seemed to move back and forth between Carbon, Hempfield, Fort Allen and Jeanette. A UPI photographer called control to inform them that he was trying to obtain photos of the objects, but that their intensity was too weak. He said what his family 12"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"was watching appeared like blue-white stars. The object would come out of the .

At least two of our investigators who were dispatched to the areas observed lights that 'they couldn't explain. In both cases'the objects took off at high speed before they could obtain a pic- ture or a better ; look. . —. ' -;. March 13-8:30 p. m.-West Newton-a fellow on a deserted back road reported that he saw a cluster of lights in the sky. ahead of him. Suddenly the lights dived down to ,within a .foot of the car roof. The lights continued to move over top of the car until they were out of sight. The'witness said that as the lights approached, the radio be- came filled with static and his headlights became very dim. He also.mentioned that his battery com- .pletely discharged, to -40 as indicated on his ampmeter. His car .didn't stall out, however. Immediately after the incident as the witness continued home, he instantly . became very tired and couldn't keep his eyes open. He in fact had a slight accident and.hit a guard rail. .The wit- ness stated that he never became . so suddenly tired as on this occasion. March 23-12:55 a.m.-Hanover Twp.-Two Game Com- mission officers on patrol saw 300 yards away from their-car,an object \"like a giant fuselage\" about 6 times the length of their car. The object from the windows reminded them of the old pullman railroad cars. There was no sound, and the object emitted a pulsating •••. light towards the ground. When the officers got out of the car to observe it better, it began to move away into a valley. Mysterious metal ball apparently man-made Dr. J. Allen Hynek has reported after a meet- ing with the National Enquirer's UFO'Blue Ribbon Panel in New Orleans April 20 and 21 that the steel ball found by the Antoine Betz family near Jacksonville, Fla., is apparently man-made, al- though still somewhat mysterious. The ball was found April 6, and examined by the Navy a few days later. Under the direction of Chief Petty Officer Chris Berninger, the Navy concluded that the object was not explosive, and is made of a high grade stainless steel. In a telephone interview with Mrs. Betz, MUFON Direc- tor Walt Andrus was given the following statis- tics: the ball is 7.96 inches in diameter, weights 21.34 pounds, and has an outer shell a- bout one-half inch thick (which would apparently withstand a pressure of 120,000 pounds per square inch). Mrs. Betz says there are three or four smaller spheres inside the ball, which rattle and move about when the ball is shaken, and there are no detactable seams to indicate a weld or a plug. The ball is magnetized, and has north and south magnetic poles which are about 150 degrees apart. Mrs. Betz says the ball can roll about on a flat table top, apparently under its own power, in a non-concentric circle for as long as ten minutes--without rolling off the table. She says the ball displays maximum activity on bright, sunny days. She also reports a possible high- pitched sound being radiated when the ball is in motion, probably above 15,000 hertz in frequency, but within a dog's hearing range (the Betz toy poodle reportedly began to whimper and cover its ears when placed near the ball). An identification of the ball was not avail- able as Skylook went to press, nor were the full reports of the examinations by the Navy and the Enquirer panel available. Any additional infor- maiton of significance will be reported in future issues. North Carolinian reports light in sky A report by Mrs. Dean Sprehe of Charlotte, N. C., of a strange light in the sky has been for- warded to Skylook by her sister, Mae Jannett of Beckmeyer, 111. Mr. and Mrs. Sprehe and son .Russel were driv- ing on 85 near Freedom Drive at about 6:30 to 6:45 p. m., Oct. 26, 1973, when, they reportedly noticed an object northeast of the Richway store about 600 to 1,000 feet high. \"At first I thought it was 'Snoop' the police helicopter,\" said Mrs. Sprehe. \"At.first it just hovered in one spot and lights blinked on and off, then it started to move across the sky slowly, then suddenly speed- ed up and made very erratic zig zag movements and just-disappeared. We could hear no noise.\" 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"UFO's Behind the Iron Curtain By Joe Brill On Thursday, Nov. 23, 1967, between 8:45 and 9:00 p. m. three Unidentified Flying Objects were observed over the city of Zagreb, Yugoslavia. The UFO's were observed by many people in that city and several members of the Croatian Natural Sci- ence Society Astronomy Department viewed this phenomenon and took photographs of it. The members of the society were gathered to- gether for a meeting at the Observatory at Popov's Tower when the UFO's were seen. \"It was around 8:45 p.m.,\" said Zoran Farcich, a senior at the high school at Tresnjevka. \"I stood at a window and all of a sudden I could not believe my eyes. Southeast under the star Alde- baran, in the constellation of Steer, I sighted three bright objects; that is, three glowing dots which eminated bluish colors. It appeared that two of the objects were motionless, while the third moved in the distance. Immediately, I ran to my photo laboratory and asked my colleague to get a camera and take some photographs of this occurence. I had a very difficult time convinc- ing him that this was not a joke.\" \"Really, I could not believe it at first,\" stated Damir Gradish, a student at the school for applied arts. \"I ran toward the window and there I saw two bright and one darker objects. We al- ways keep cameras ready and it did not take me long to get a camera with a tripod and to take some pictures. I used \"Agfa\" film of 32 dins and I exposed it for two minutes. All the while I could observe the bright objects and follow them with my binoculars.\" At the same time Zoran called upon Darko Fej- zagich, a most articulate young student at the Tresnjevka High School, to take a small \"Zeis\" telescope and observe the bright objects. \"I also saw these three objects, but by the time I had set up the telescope they were gone.,I really don't know what to make out of this ap- pearance. They could not have been satellites, since it would not be possible to have three satellites together like that, and even if .they were synchronized to fly together, they certainly could not have had such a brightness and intens- ity. Besides all of this, the satellites would have had to follow a specific trajectory and maintain a certain speed.\" The young members of the society were at a loss to explain the origin of these objects. Another member of the Astronomy Department, Kresimir Cosich, a graduate of the high school, stated; \"We have often received various informa- tion about the so called flying saucers, and they were always discounted by scientific analysis. But, in my opinion it is impossible that the pic- tures taken by Damir show any of the known celes- trial bodies. You see, these are three objects of fairly intensive brightness. Under similar con- ditions it is impossible to see such objects in the sky. Here we are dealing with something very out of the ordinary and unknown.\" There was a great deal of excitement among the members of the Astronomy Department which was only understandable. They had managed to observe along with many other Zagreb citizens and to se- cure documented proof of the unusual appearance in the sky on Nov. 23, 1967. What were those ob- jects seen? The only answer we can conclude is that they were three Unidentified Flying Objects. On that same day at 7:30 p.m. a UFO was sighted near Kolasin. UFO's were also'reported to have been seen over Niksich and the village of Slatine in Yugoslavia. These are the facts of what was seen that day, and it all took place during a period of time when Yugoslavia was'having one of the largest UFO flaps to occur in that country. 14"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Close look at wildly-lighted UFO reported WEATHERFORD, OKLA., NEWS, NOV. 30, 1973--Darrel Nickels, a 19-year-old carpenter, reportedly got a close- up view of a wildly-lighted UFO a- bout 7:30 p.m. on Nov. 29, and his sighting seemed to be at least par- tially verified by other sightings that same night. Nickels relates that he was driv- ing on a rural road near Dead Wo- man 's Crossing when he spotted what he at first thought was a helicop- ter. \"The top part of the thing was covered with about 30 flashing red, white, and blue lights like the kind on top of ambulances and police cars,\" he said. He continued to drive slowly to- ward the bridge, and the craft hov- ered about 30 feet to one side and above the crossing. He slowly drove across the bridge until he was about 30 feet from the object, where he stopped his car and shut off the en- gine. He could hear no sound. \"I looked for about three minutes, I guess. Then a bright light came on from the side of the object and shined up and down the creek,\" he related. \"I took off north down the road.\" Describing the object to police, he said it was 16.to 20 feet wide, 9 to 10 feet high, and had several \"pads.\" It had about 30'flashing red, and white, and blue lights; did not seem to notice his car; and made no noise.

The report by Nickels was one of several re- ports, including 35 to 40 phone calls to the Weatherford police and a dozen persons coming di- rectly to the polico station, according to Weatherford police dispatcher Jimmy King. Follow- ing Nickels' sighting, King sent a teletype to state authorities about the sighting, and in a few minutes he received a reply from Blackwell that one of their police officers had also re- ported seeing strange moving lights in the sky.

Hundreds see UFO over Italy Hundreds of residents of Milan, Italy, sighted an Unidentified Flying Object swirling above the city March 28. Witnesses told police that the object, flashing green lights, moved above the Cathedral Square and was visible for nearly two hours. Police used floodlights in an attmept to identify the object. Police gave no explanation for the phenomenon. Milan airports reported that nothing unusual had appeared on their radars. Similar appearances of Unidentified Flying Objects were reported from the Piedmont and Venetian regions of Italy in the past few months. (Reported on Paul Harvey News, Chicago, March 29, 1974.

His famous 1,500-page report, which sold about 200,000 copies, claimed that \"there is no evi- dence\" that flying saucers exist. The report said, \"It is regarded by scientists today as es- sentially certain that intelligent life exists elsewhere, but with essentially no possibility of contact between the communities on planets as- sociated with different stars. We therefore con- clude that there is no relation between intelli- gent life elsewhere in other \" solar systems and UFO phenomena as observed on Earth.\" The report said that Earth could not expect to be visited by spaceships from other solar systems for at least 10,000 years. The Condon Report was widely attacked by such persons and groups as Dr. J. Allen Hynek; Major Donald E. Keyhoe; NICAP; Congressman J. Edward Roush, chairman of the 1968 Congressional hear- ings on UFO's; the 35,000-member American Insti- tute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, which in- cluded the majority of leading aerospace scien- tists; and a number of others. (Author Frank Ed- wards suffered a fatal heart attack while plan- ning an expose of the procedures being used by Condon.) Dr. Condon was well known as a non-believer in UFO's even before the Colorado study was made. The day after the project was announced, he said, \"It is highly improbable they exist.\" Not long after the study was underway, Condon was quoted in the Rocky Mountain News as saying, \"We have to take it on faith that the Air Force is not trying to deceive us...Maybe they are.. I don't care much.\" On Jan. 25, 1967, three months after the study began, he was quoted as telling two scien- tific societies in New York that the Air Force did not take UFO's seriously. \"My attitude right now is that there's nothing to it, but I'm not supposed to have a conclusion until we finish.\" Condon and the project administrator, Robert J. Low, had been given the exclusive authority to select which cases the group of scientists would study, and they selected only about 100 out of an estimated 15,000 which were made available to them. Of those which were selected, some had al- ready been labeled doubtful by NICAP, which had cooperated in providing reports. Low's attitude toward the study is apparently revealed in his written suggestions to University of Colorado administrators on Aug. 9, 1966, prior to becoming project administrator: \"In order to undertake such a project, one has to approach it objectively. That is, one has to admit the pos- sibility that such things , (as UFO's) exist. It is not respectible to give serious consideration to such a possibility....we would lose more in prestige in the scientific community than we could possibly gain by undertaing the investiga- tion.... Our study would be conducted almost ex- clusively by non-believers, who although they couldn't possibly prove a negative result, could, and probably would, add an impressive body of evidence that there is not reality to the obser- vations. The trick would be, I think, to describe the project so that to the public it would appear a totally objective study, but to the scientific community would present the image of a group of non believers trying their best to be objective, but having an almost zero expectation of finding a saucer....\" Many of the scientists assembled to work on the University'of Colorado study expressed a more open attitude toward the question of UFO's, but they could investigate only the cases given them by Condon and Low. Two of them, Dr. David Saun- ders (who currently operates the computer at the University of Colorado where MUFON reports are tabulated) and Dr. Norman Levine, were instrumen- tal in attempting to put pressure on Condon and Low to investigate the better cases and to ac- tually interview witnesses in such cases. For these efforts, both Dr. Saunders and Dr. Levine were removed from the project. Dr. Saunders later recounted his experience in his book UFOs? Yes! As noted in a related article in this month's Skylook, Dr. Condon continued to defend his anti- UFO views until he died.

Coast Guard and FAA officials said there were no reports of aircraft in the vicinity at the time. The sightings brought to three the number reported since March 14 when a state trooper and state ferry employees reported a glowing object. (Submitted by Mrs. Jean Anderson) 'No evidence' Dr. Condon a non-believer to the end EDITOR'S NOTE: The following appeared in the March 6, 1974, edition of the Santa Ana, Calif., Register. It was written only three weeks before Dr. Condon died, thus indicating that the well- known scientist had not changed his public views concerning UFO's. By David Branch and Robert B.. Klinn Although over 15 million Americans believe that they have seen unidentified flying objects (UFOs), one famous physicist at the University of Colorado says that they are all 'mistaken. Dr. Edward U. Condon, writing last month to readers of the \"National' Enquirer\" newspaper, stated that when \"UFO reports .and photos are not faked and can be tracked down, they always turn out to be sightings of a natural phenomenon.\" Condon thus maintains a staunchly anti-UFO at- titude first expressed eight years ago during his days as head of the Air Force-funded University of Colorado UFO study—an attitude responsible for hindered research and decreased news coverage of UFO's for the last 5 years. For in his influen- tial final 'report, released in January, 1969, Condon concluded that \"nothing has come from the study of UFOs during the past 21 years...\" and \"further extensive study of UFOs probably cannot be justified...\" (\"The Scientific Study of Uni- dentified Flying Objects,\" Bantam: New York, 1969, p.l.) An examination of the Condon Report itself, however, indicates that Condon's recent state- ments are in disagreement with facts discovered by his own Colorado Project staff. If UFO re- ports \"always turn out to be sightings of a na- tural phenomenon,\" one might ask, why did the Condon Project fail to explain 30 per cent of the total number of cases it examined? Condon also stated in last month's letter: \"I undertook a thorough investigation of the many reported sightings of UFOs.\" The Condon committee actually looked at only about 100 UFO cases—a small fraction of the estimated (at that time) 5 million total sightings; or the over 10,000 re- ports in Air Force files. The physicist also wrote; \"The Condon Report shows that in no case was there any evidence to support...(th) out-of-space theory.\" One wonders why Dr. Condon did not mention' Case 2 in his letter. This dramatic event in- volved a combination radar-visual tracking of a UFO AT Lakenheath, England, August 13-14, 1956. An unknown object out-manuevered and flew faster than pursuing jet aircraft. The Condon Report concluded: \"In summary, this is the most puzzling and unusual case in the radar-visual files. The apparently rational, intelligent behavior of the UFO suggests a mechanical device of unknown ori- (.continued on next page) 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Strange light in sky drops orange stream Following is a report investigated by Mrs. Idabel Epperson, MUFON Director for Southern Cal- ifornia: Environmental Factors: 56 degrees, clear, mostly calm (slight wind from east), bright moon. James F. Clinker, a former fighter pilot and former policeman, was driving, from Glendale, Calif., west on Foothill Blvd. about 11:40 p.m. on April 12, 1974, when he noticed \"a very bright orange light\" to his left. He estimated that the light was about five miles south of him, and a- bout two miles west of Haynes Canyon Road. He got out of his car to watch the object. Clinker esti- mated the object was about 700 feet high, and traveling north about 20 miles per hour when first observed. He said the light did not flick- er, and was too bright to be a candle or a flash- light hoax. Clinker said the obj,ect was larger than a full moon. The object stopped moving at one point for about two seconds. When about two miles from him, the object turned west, traveled about an eighth of a mile, and then went south again. On four occasions the object•dropped an orange-colored fire which was darker than the light, and which was thick at the top and narrow- er as it neared the ground, he said. Clinker said he saw no outline of any craft, due to the dark- ness and the intensity of the light. The object disappeared behind some hills about ten miles south of the witness, according to his report. Clinker notes that he has not had a drink of al- coholic beverage for more than 20 years. In his only previous sighting, he and about 20 neighbors saw a UFO about 2:00 in the afternoon in 1947. Dr. Condon a non-believer to the end . . .

Or one can cite Case 46 (pp. 396-407)—the fam- ous McMinnville, Oregon photographs of a disc- shaped object, taken May 11, 1950. The Condon analyst concluded: \"...all factors investigated, geometric, psychological and physical, appear to be consistent with the assertion that an extra- ordinary flying object, silvery, metallic, disk- shaped, tens of meters in diameter, and evidently artificial, flew within sight of two witnesses.\" (p. 407.) (In the light of such evidence, one scientist commented: \"I seriously wonder if Dr. Condon read his own report before writing his conclusions.\") Condon further stated in his letter to the \"Enquirer\" that \"when people do witness an actual event, their descriptions of it vary so widely that they cannot be used as scientific proof of that event.\" Again an incident in the Condon report contra- dicts this remark. Case 18 (pp. 300-305) details investigation of \"descriptions of objects known to have been hot-air balloons. The Condon staff con- cluded that a \"comparison of the event as des- cribed by the launchers with the reports of acci- dental witnesses reveals obvious similarities re- garding size, shape, color, and relative position of the objects...the degree of similarity between the reports is note-worthy, especially since times of observations and locations of observers were not the same...In summary, we have a number of reports that are highly consistent with one another...\" One of the most puzzling and perhaps revealing statements that Condon made in his letter is that the Air Force has \"spent a minimal amount of time on the (UFO) problem during the past 4 or 5 years.\" Officially, the Air Force has spent no time on UFOs. One wonders if the \"minimal\" time referred to by Condon is an inadvertent admission of suspected secret research projects. Two questions remain unanswered: in light of the high percentage of unexplained UFO cases in the Condon Report, including the sightings by American Astronauts, why did Condon conclude that there is no reason to conduct further research? And why does Dr. Condon, five years after release of his report, continue to issue statements at variance with known facts about UFOs? Nuclear physicist Stanton T. Friedman, an in- ternationally known .UFO authority, states: \"Con- don's contribution to the University of Colorado study was certainly negative and his actions since the publication of the Study even more so.\" Copyright 1974 by Robert B.

Kirkpatrick, MUFON investigator and West Coast Coordinator for Skylook: Environmental conditions—clear, about 20 de- grees, calm, many stars. Larry E. Kinsley, 37, and his brother Robert were moving their parents' furniture in a U-Haul truck from Buhl, Idaho, to Hemet, Calif., when the reported sighting occurred. At about 4:15 a.m.., as they were traveling on Highway 93 about 50 miles north of McGill, Nev., near Cherry Creek Mountain, Larry was awakened by his brother, who was driving,and told that a UFO was following the truck. Larry did not take his brother seriously, and went back to sleep. About 10 minutes later, Larry was again awakened, and this time saw a round, orange object that appeared to be ten feet off the desert floor. \"I couldn't tell how far away it was,\" he said. C4- We of road Rema ins O O and \"I then looked out the right side of the cab and saw three more smaller objects that were higher up and were blue. One of them was flick- ering off and on. The other two remained con- stant.\" Larry was told by his brother that the orange object had been on the right side of the truck, and had passed the truck, crossed over the road, and come up to the left side of the cab. \"We were moving at about 55 miles per hour,\" said Larry, \"and at that moment it felt like we had been hit by a blast of wind or force field,\"which made the truck seem to float and sway above the highway. The lights on the truck flickered on and off, and the engine started to miss.\" Robert then reportedly lost control of the truck. Be- fore Robert could stop, the transmission selector jumped out of \"drive\" into \"neutral,\" and the truck coasted to a stop. silver £e<L Said Larry, \"As we sat there in the middle of the road with the motor running, we observed a huge silver metal ball with a dome on top and sharp wings, standing still over a hill to the left. It was pulsating.\" Larry explained that \"we were scared half to death as we observed a huge light on the road in front of us that had a red light on top of it. We thought it was moving toward us. It appeared to be maybe a mile ahead of us. I got out of the truck and shined my flashlight at it, but nothing happened. I then looked under the truck to dis- cover the drive shaft turning.\" He got back into the truck,\"fearing for my life,\" and the brothers watched the light move closer. \"We felt that we were in a vacuum of some kind and isolated from the rest of the world.\" This lasted about 20 minutes, \"then it seemed to disappear and it was over.\" After flagging down a car and getting a ride to McGill, they obtained another U-Haul truck and returned to the scene. \"After we unloaded the truck, he (the station man) had to shove it off the highway, as both wheels would not move,\" said Larry. \"I don't know if it was mechanical failure or whether it was the UFO's that disabled us. I guess I will always wonder the rest of my life.\" Robert B. Klinn and David Branch, in a column in the Santa Ana Register, wrote that in an in- terview the U-Haul dealer said that the entire rear end of the truck had to be replaced—the tires, the rear axle, the outside housing, and the gears. The dealer said that when the tow truck lifted the rear of the U-Haul truck the rear wheels \"just fell right off.\" The witnesses are both salesmen: Larry sells real estate, and Robert sells for National drinks. Larry summarized their experience by stating, \"We were both of sound mind and body, and we both saw the Objects together and experi- enced the same feelings.\" 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Astronomy Notes By Mark Herbstritt MAY SKY Mercury--is too close to the Sun for observa- tion.

Two reports of strange lights sent from Fayette County, Iowa Two reports of strange lights in the sky have been forwarded to Skylook by Fayette County Iowa State Section Director LeRoy R. Lathem. The first sighting was made at 1:30 a.m., Oct. 15, 1973, by a Mrs. Hibbens, of Oelwein, la., who was ganging up laundry when the whole sky ap- peared to light up, she reported. There was an object about tree level with white lights, she said, and the lights were outlining the shape and criss-corssing trhough the middle of the object. She said she watched it for a minute, and it slowly started to move upward, making a swishing sound. Mrs. Hibbens said the object looked like a football all lit up. Her son came out of the house and saw the object as it went out of sight, according to the report. A second sighting was made at 6:10 p. m., Oct. 32, by Mrs. Goldie Fox, of Oelwein, who. was driving east on Highway 57 about four miles east of Cedar Falls when she reportedly noticed a solid bright green light, shaped like a football, coming from her left about 200 feet high. She stated that there was no noise or flashing light. After watching it for one minute as it slowly moved across the highway before disappearing from sight, she resumed her normal speed. She reports that a truck driver in front of her also apparently saw the object, since he hit his brakes, causing her to apply hers. UFO over Turin, Italy, chased and seen on airport radar NATIONAL ENQUIRER, FEB. 10, 1974--0n Nov. 30, 1973, at Caselle Airport in Turin, Italy, pilot Riccardo Marano was returning rom a flight in a small plane when the control tower informed him that a UFO was hovering high over the runway. \"Suddenly, when I was about 2% miles from the runway,\" explains Marano, \"I saw it--an enormous luminous globe giving out a tremendous light which went from violet to blue and even red. I'll admit I was frightened, but when it moved away as if it had spotted me, I followed it.\" He said the object was traveling about 300 miles per hour, and that he followed it for a- while before deciding he was running low on fuel. \"So I hit the throttle and lunged for it,\" said Marano, \"but it took off with a whoosh—straight up in the air at about 3,500 miles an hour--and disappeared completely. Whatever it was, it sure could travel. I've never seen anything like it.\" The only official comment was made by Col. Franco Rusticelli, the airport's base chief: \"On the evening of Nov. 30, a luminous object was seen either stationary or moving very slowly west of the airport. It was picked up on radar. Noth- ing similar has been seen before, and we had no air activity at the time.\" He confirmed Marano's pursuit of the object. Livio Patrini, ground controller at the air- port, said, \"I can confirm the object was sighted on radar and chases by the pilot of a plane. At the time the sky was clear, the moon was full, and visibility was excellent. Before it disap- peared I watched it in the sky for at least 10 minutes.\" Six days before the airport sighting, Franco Contin, a University of Turin biology student, claims to have photographed a bright object in the area, and newspapers received several other reports at the time. Contin said that he and Margarita Belmondo were sitting outside his house when they saw the object. \"First it was lunin- ous, and then it was dull, and then it would go red like a burning ball,\" he said. \"I grabbed my camera and got a couple of shots. When I de- veloped the film at home I was absolutely stun- ned. One print showed a distinct cigar-shaped outline, and another showed it like a ball of light disappearing behind a hill.\" Miss Belmondo said the object had moved across the sky \"in a straight line, and then took off vertically at incrediable speed.\" Domenico de Franceso, a security guard at the airport, said he had sighted the object several times before Contin had taken his photos on Nov. 24.
