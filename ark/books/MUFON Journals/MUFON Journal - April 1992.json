However, since my parents, L.W. and Edith McGuffm, were living in Roswell, N.M. at that time, I asked them in later years, when I became interested in UFOs, what they remembered about the alleged saucer crash northwest of town that has since become known as \"the Roswell Incident.\" \"Not a thing,\" was their surprising answer. \"We were pinch- ing pennies in those days and didn't take the paper,\" mother explained. \"And people who did read it weren't talking it up all over town? No one came into your shop saying, 'Mac, have you heard about the flying saucer they've found out at Corona?' \" \"No, nothing like that. I don't think we'd even heard of flying saucers until after we left Roswell.\" It was incredulous. Here local radio and newspaper had announced a monumental event in human history had gone down, right in the old hometown, the world media were beating down Roswell's door, and there in town, it caused so little stir that a young tradesman in a shop on the court- house square never heard a word about it! Before my birth, the family moved to Portales, where Daddy worked for many years at Wheeler Mortuary. New Mexico is an unpopulous state; there are few enough morticians there that from association meetings and transfer of \"remains\" from place of death to place of burial, most of them know each other. So when I read in the MUFON UFO Journal that a Roswell mortician by the name of Glenn Dennis figured in the story of the 1947 crash, I asked my dad about him. \"I remember him,\" he ruminated, \"but I don't know what's become of him. He didn't stay in the mortuary business and, I think, left Roswell. Haven't heard anything of him in years.\" I wouldn't realize how intrigued Daddy had become until a few months later when he told me over the phone, \"Well, I've tracked down Glenn Dennis, and I've arranged for you to talk with him when you come out for Christmas.\" In preparation for the interview, I bought and read a copy of Kevin Randle and Don Schnutt's UFO Crash at Roswell. Mention of Dennis' brush with the recovery operation and a drawing by him of alien anatomy appear in that book. Ob- vious artistic talent could be seen in the sketch, and the brief account of his walk-on role in the drama that was unfolding at Roswell Army Air Base on July 7, 1947 promised an in- teresting conversation. On New Year's Eve, I met with Glenn at Outa Limits, a video shop across the highway from the industrial complex that was once the military base which, 44 years ago, received several loads of unidentified wreckage rancher Mac Brazel had found strewn over 3/4 mile of sheep pasture near the village of Corona. Also present were Glenn's brother, Bob Dennis, SFC Clifford Stone, U.S. Army retired, author of UFO's: Let the Evidence Speak for Itself, and John and Sharon Price, owner/operators of Outa Limits, which seems to be the official hangout of Roswell area UFO folk. Glenn claims not to be one of them. Bob, he says, is the UFO buff of the family. His own involvement came not so much from interest in the subject as from chance; he was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. After years as a mortuary owner and entrepreneur in eastern New Mexico real estate, he enjoys a busy retirement and is a sculptor. His wife encouraged him to write down his oral history of his extraordinary experience, mainly for their children, but after he went public with the information, both have been uncom- fortable with the attention and curiosity that resulted. \"I wouldn't be talking to you about it now,\" he said, \"if it weren't for your dad.\" He's a soft-spoken man with nothing to prove, but now that his story is out in the open, he wants it told as it happened. The following is condensed from a transcript of that tape- recorded interview: Anne MacFie: Glenn, what's your connection with the Roswell UFO crash story? Glenn Dennis: I was a funeral director at the time, employed at Ballard Funeral home here in Roswell. The way I became involved, I got a call about 1:30 (p.m., 7/7/47) from the mor- tuary officer out at the air base. He was inquiring what size hermetically sealed caskets we had. Did we have 3 '6 \" to 4'? I said we had the 4' in stock and could get a 3'6\" from Amarillo in the morning. I said, \"What's going on?\" He said this would be for future use. In another 15-20 minutes, he called back. Said, \"Where you've had bodies lying out in the elements for several days, what is your preparation? What would your chemicals do to the tissues? To the stomach contents? Would it change the blood contents?\" I said it definitely would change the contents, and I gave him the preparation. I asked him, \"What have you got?\" He said, \"This is also for future use.\" Another 30 minutes or so, I get an ambulance emergency. Out at the scene of the accident there was an airman that had been riding a motorcycle and had a severely lacerated forehead and broken nose. I gave him temporary first aid, and he sat up Anne MacFie is a professional songwriter and folk- singer, and a MUFON State Section Director for the Red River Counties area of Kentucky. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 288 April 1992"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"\"One of the hands was severed ... when they turned it over, there were little tiny suction cups on the inside of the fingers.\" in the front seat with me. When we got to the base hospital, there were three old military field ambulances where I usually parked. The M.P.s standing beside the back doors of the am- bulances didn't stop or pay a lot of attention to us, and I got him up the ramp. The doors on two of those ambulances were open, and I noticed some wreckage in there. When you get plane crashes, you have to take parts of bodies out of the wreckage. But what was odd about this was there were pieces around two to three feet that had a real odd shape, kind of like the end of a canoe. It had a lot of inscriptions on it, about three inches high, that, to me, looked like Egyptian hieroglyphics. The metal didn't look like aluminum. It looked like stainless steel that had became very hot — a real purplish-bluish color on the metal. I checked the airman into the infirmary and started on back to the nurses' and doctors' lounge to get a Goke, because it was real hot. I saw this captain there I didn't know. Where I got in trouble, I asked him, \"Do we have a plane crash?\" He said, \"Who are you?\" I said, \"Well, I'm the funeral director from Roswell, and we have the contract. Looks like maybe we have a plane crash. Do I need to go start making preparations to bring in the bodies?\" He said, \"You stay right here. Don't you move. Just stay right there.\" He was gone a minute or so, and when he came back, he had two M.P.s with him. He told them, \"You get this man out and escort him to the funeral home.\" We were going down the hall when there was this loud voice, \"You bring that S.O.B. back!\" There was a big, red-headed officer, about 6 3 \", and he said, \"Let me tell you something, mister. You don't go back into Roswell and start a bunch of stories that there's been a crash. Nothing's happened out here!\" I was a litte bit mad. I was very mad! When somebody you've never seen calls you an S.O.B., it upsets you pretty good! I informed him I was a civilian and there wasn't anything he could do and, as far as I was concerned, he could go to hell. He said, \"Let me tell you, mister, if you do, somebody'll be picking your bones out of the sand!\" There was a black sergeant there with a clipboard, and he made the comment, \"Sir, he'd make better dog food.\" (Mean- ing the threat of an attack by security dogs.) Anyway, he (the red-headed officer) called me a son-of-a- bitch again and said, \"Get him out of here.\" I hadn't taken five or six steps when this nurse that I had known was coming out of a room. She had a towel up to her face and looked as if she had been sick. She saw me and said, \"Glenn, what are .you doing here? Get out of here as fast as you can or you're gonna get in a lot of trouble!\" Well, the M.P.s had me by the arms, and they were taking me out, anyway. They did escort me back to the funeral home, all the way. After I got back, why, naturally I was curious because I'd never been treated like that. We always had the run of the base. I knew these people (the base medical personnel) pretty well. MacFie: How well did you know that nurse? Dennis: You need to know the background on her. She was 23 years old, from St. Paul, Minnesota. She was raised in a Catholic convent, had never gone to a public school. She was going to be a nun, wanted to be a teacher, but kept get- ting the feeling that God wanted her to be a nurse, so she changed over to nurse's training. She got into a program where the military would send her through her last two years of col- lege, then she would be commissioned a second lieutenant and give them back three years. Roswell was her first assign- ment, (as an Army Nurse) and she'd been there less than three months. I kept trying to get her on the phone. Finally, she called next day about 11 o'clock and said, \"I know you've been try- ing to get ahold of me. Why don't you meet me at the of- ficers' club?\" I met her out there, and she looked very ill — had almost gone into shock. She said, \"Before I tell you this, you have to give me your word you will not mention my name or anything I tell you, because if you do, I will be in very serious trouble.\" What had happened, she went into this room to get some supplies and saw two doctors in there with a gurney and these small bodies that were in a rubber sheet or a body pouch. Two of the bodies had been very badly mangled, like maybe the predators had been eating on them, but one was in pretty good shape. She gave me a diagram she had drawn of the little figures and explained what the doctors told her. They wanted her to write down everything they were looking at as they were examining the bodies. MacFie: Could she draw well enough to give you a clear idea of what she'd seen? Dennis: Very well. Like one of the hands was severed from the body, and when they flipped it over, there were little tiny suction cups on the inside of the fingers. Only four fingers, no fingernails. The heads were large, eyes were set in. The skulls were soft like a newborn baby's; they were pliable. The ears, instead of one canal, had two canals, no lobes or anything, just a little flap over each canal. No teeth. The mouths were just very small slits. Their face and nose were concave and only two orifices where the nose was. She had this on the back of a prescription pad. MacFie: When did you make the drawing that was reproduced in UFO Crash at Roswell? Dennis: I didn't do that until I came out with my own story. But I remember it because I kept files on all the autopsies MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 288 April 1992"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"I worked on, all the legal cases when I was on a coroner's jury, on the military, and I had a personal file. That's where I kept this for years. She gave it to me, and I'd see it when I was going through my files. I knew exactly what it looked like. MacFie: After you were removed from the base, did any more contact result between you and the military concerning what you had walked into? Dennis: No. No one ever bothered me. MacFie: At the time, did you talk about what was going on with anyone other than this nurse I'll call Sister X? Dennis: I only told one man, and that was my father. He was real upset. We were a very straight, Christian family. My mother was very religious, and he was the most patriotic man in the world. He said, \"If you do anything against the govern- ment, I'll shoot you myself.\" MacFie: Between that time and the 70s, when interest in the Roswell \"rumors\" started heating up, did you tell about your experience? Dennis: No one ever asked me. I knew all those people who were involved — Walter Haut, Pappy Henderson — but we never mentioned it. It never did come up until a few years ago. MacFie: Then how did Stanton Friedman find out about you? Dennis: They got my name off some papers in Washington, D.C. MacFie: To my knowledge, your nurse informant is a lead that hasn't been followed up by Friedman or by Randle and Schmitt. I assume you're protecting her identity? Dennis: I'm trying to. MacFie: Is she still living? Dennis: I don't know. I heard she died three years ago, but that's only hearsay. MacFie: Have you tried to contact her yourself to see if she would talk now that others have? Dennis: I never did try and contact her. I don't know where she is. She did join an order after she got out of the army. But I don't think she would. She was so disciplined that if her superior told her to walk across fire, she probably would have done it. She was trained that way all her life. MacFie: Then why do you think she went against her orders and told you what she'd seen? \"/ believed when she showed me that diagram, that is what she saw, this is what she heard, this is what she wrote down. She would never have made it up.\" Dennis: Well, I was pressing her, and she was so upset, she hod to talk to somebody about it. We were both caught up in it — neither one of us asked for it. I just want you to understand that there's no way in the world this lady would have made that up. If it had been anyone else I might not have believed it. But I believed, when she showed me that diagram, that this is what she saw, this is what she heard, this is what she wrote down. She would never have made it up. In contrast with the mild-mannered, there's-the-truth, take- it-or-leave-it Dennis, Clifford Stone is a man with a cause to fight. An Army insider and veritable human databank, this dude is out to blow the lid off Roswell, and as he tells how he's been blasting the bureaucrats with their own ammo, one can practically watch his blood pressure climb. His adventures in squeezing informational blood from the national security turnip would make a lengthy piece, but someone who can keep up with his rapid-fire barrage of facts, figures, military regula- tions and document numbers will have to write that one. MacFie: Cliff, what's brought you to Roswell? Stone: I retired here. MacFie: Were you stationed at Walker? (Roswell Army Air Field was renamed Walker Air Force Base when the Air Force was made a separate branch of the Armed Services.) Stone: No, I was in the Army. I was stationed in Roswell, but it was an ROTC assignment. MacFie: \\bu've researched the Roswell Incident pretty thoroughly; perhaps you can shed some light on a confused issue. Do you believe a second crash site, the one at which dead bodies of a non-human crew were seen, was near Magdalena, as Friedman and the witnesses Anderson and Barnett have located it, or only a few miles from the main debris field at Corona, as Randle and Schmitt say? Stone: Why not both sites? Why not two crafts? Why not two crashes? Say they collided, one was more damaged than the other and crashed at Corona and the other at San Agustin (Plain, near Magdalena). MacFie: Would that mean, then, that more than the tradi- tional four bodies were recovered? Stone: I've heard reports of four dead at Roswell and three MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 288 April 1992"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"dead, one alive at Magdalena. There was a rather large piece found right there at Corona. Initially, there was .talk of a ten to twelve-foot \"crumpled dish pan.\" MacFie: The so-called \"radar reflector dish\"? Stone: The Army at Ft. Carswell (Texas) identified the Roswell object as a weather balloon carrying a radar reflector dish. That's where Intelligence blew it. The type of balloon shown torn up in the photos was used to carry aloft packages of sensitive instruments. They (balloons of this sort) were covered with aluminum foil which could be picked up and tracked by radar. Non-metallic balloon clusters were used to carry radar reflector dishes in order to pick up as little balloon and as much dish as possible. In all probability, the balloon in the pictures came from Carswell, but the only place that was using radar reflector dishes then was White Sands, and none of theirs, for nine months before the incident and nine months after, was miss- ing. Eighth Air Force Headquarters in Texas could mangle up a weather balloon to convince the media, but if some reporter had asked to see die radar reflector dish, they couldn't have produced one. Something that wasn't a weather balloon went down out there. And Roswell was just the first of many crashes and retrievals — probably about twelve. MacFie: If UFO technology is so advanced, why do so many keep wiping out? Stone: Our own technology is great, but we still have accidents. MacFie: Another thing, if these little guys have the power over us the abductees say they do, why would they let us recover their hardware and their dead? Why didn't they just paralyze Wright-Patterson (AFB in Ohio, where the wreckage is said to have been taken) and take it all back? Stone: Are you so sure they haven't? I would suggest to you that in 1947 they assisted in the coverup. Some strange things happened to some witnesses that were totally unearthly. MacFie: Can you give us a \"for instance?\" Stone: That's got to be their story to tell. MacFie: What's happening on the Roswell UFO scene today? Stone: There's still a lot of reports coming in from this area. Bob Dennis: From Portales all the way to White Sands there's always been a lot of UFO activity. Some of those Elida (a remote, forlorn village between Roswell and Portales) ranch- ers — your dad knows some of them; he's buried their fathers and mothers — they've seen things you wouldn't believe. They won't tell it to a stranger, but they see things. Stone: People won't talk about it, and the press doesn't like to carry the stories. John Price: We get much less UFO information in New Mex- ico than other states do. Our newspapers still have a policy to not print these stories. New Mexico is definitely a military state. MacFie: Well, some people in Roswell are going to get the information to the public. Tell me about the UFO museum that's in the works. Glenn Dennis: We've been going about this very carefully. It's not going to be a 30-day wonder or an advertising pro- motion. To us, this is very serious. We've incorporated and have applied for status as a non-profit organization. The city is backing it. The Chamber of Commerce is behind it. We have a board of directors. Walter Haul is president ... MacFie: Wasn't he the Public Information Officer who spilled the beans in '47? Is he still here? Price: That's the one. Dennis: He's our president, I'm vice president, and our secretary is your dad's old friend, Max Littell. MacFie: Max! I never knew he was into this stuff! Dennis: Oh, yes for a long time. MacFie: In the absence of that long-sought \"tangible evidence\" of UFOs, one might ask what is there to exhibit in a UFO museum? Dennis: Oh, photographs, videotapes — we'll be construct- ing some UFO replicas. I'll be doing some sculpture for it. Anything having to do with UFOs. We've already started receiving material and have a secure vault where it's being stored. Stan Friedman, Stone here, Randle and Schmitt, the Fund for UFO Research, some people in Germany and Switzerland — people have offered material from all over the world, and we're gonna put it in the International UFO Museum and Research Center at Roswell, New Mexico. MacFie: Do you know yet where it will be? Dennis: We've been offered three different locations. Right now, we're operating out of a suite of offices on the seventh floor of the Sun West Bank Building. MacFie: And your projected date of opening? Dennis: Sometime in 1993, we think. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 288 April 1992"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"\"America in 1947 was still operating under a wartime mentality. If something was put to them in terms of patriotic duty, it was done and not questioned.\" MacFie: It's a great idea, and where else in the world would be a more appropriate place for it than the \"Home of the Roswell Incident?\" I'll throw out one last thing. America in 1947 was still operating under a wartime mentality. A very real threat to our country and the whole world had been narrowly over- come, and people were still powerfully committed to pull together for the national good. If something was put to them in terms of patriotic duty, it was done and not questioned in a way those of us who came of age in the \"Power to the Peo- ple\" generation can scarcely imagine. So an event as big and important as the Roswell Crash could be put under wraps that would not start to come undone for decades. But that was then, and this is now. So very much has unraveled why, 45 years later, can we still not get to the bottom of what hap- pened here? Dennis: I don't have any idea. All I know is what happened to me. Something had to have happened or I wouldn't have got into the trouble I got into. I've never been treated like that before. Something happened. Stone: What crashed here was something not of this earth, and I think the American public needs to be apprised of what it was. I'll tell you how to find out: It's called operation Blue Fly Report #314. It's in the classified vault at the 7602nd Field Air Activities Group, Ft. Beloir, Virginia. If you get that report, then you will get every question you have to ask about what happened here answered. There's only one problem: that report is so sensitive, they'll neither confirm nor deny its existence. Dennis: It all comes right back to Roswell. I had a lot to think about as I drove the dark and desolate 90 miles back to Portales, through haunted Elida, along an interminably straight highway practically devoid of traffic on a New Year's Eve — not even a state police roadblock. The picture emerging from what those men back in Roswell had to say is one of a totally unfamiliar situation and a sur- prised power structure struggling to gain control over it. The back-tracking, the inconsistencies, the behavior that just doesn't make sense — all of it indicates the U.S. military was flying by the seat of its pants, making policy and mistakes as it went along. It would have made sense for the officers at the base hospital to have told Glenn Dennis something like, \"Yes, there has been a plane crash, but we won't need your services because the victims were foreign diplomats on a sensitive mission and their government is demanding the immediate, unpublicized return of the bodies.\" It made no sense for them to arouse his suspicion with threats and intimidation — unless the sud- den appearance of an unauthorized civilian threw them into such a panic they couldn't come up with a believable answer to his inquiry, and so they copped a \"because I say so\" at- titude, not at all unheard of among people in authority. It made sense for them to get Glenn quickly off the base and to thwart his attempts to telephone \"Sister X.\" It made no sense to allow him right back on base the next day and let him lunch with her, showing pictures and conversing fur- tively under their noses in the officers' club — unless their ducks were not yet in a line concerning whom they would place under surveillance. It was several days, remember, before Mac Brazel was taken into custody. It would have made sense to have an alien autopsy recorded by a career Army Nurse whose experience, loyalty and ability to keep her mouth shut could be depended upon. It made no sense to assign such responsibility to a squeamish novice — unless those performing the autopsy had no idea how secret their work would become and chose \"Sister X\" simply because she was there. What we see in these instances are little holes left in the shroud of secrecy being hastily sewn up, even as it was be- ing drawn across the evidence in 1947. Cliff Stone's radar reflector business is another. Every document he ferrets out which is not supposed to exist makes it a little more thread- bare. Glenn Dennis is weary of telling his story, but every listener who thinks, \"I've known Glenn for years. Hearing this from him isn't the same as reading it from the front page of a tabloid in the the check-out lane. Something really did happen, and I want to know what!\" — that person is helping to widen the many holes in the Roswell cover-up. People united who won't be lied to can tear down the Berlin Wall; they can topple Marcos and Ceausescu; they can dismantle the Soviet Union. Why could they not demand and get an end to UFO secrecy by world governments? In a time far more dangerous than our own, the poet Ber- tolt Brecht had the courage to ask the Nazi power structure: \"If the Government has lost confidence in the People, why doesn't the Government dissolve the People and elect another?\" Unless this is precisely what our government has in mind — under the direction of some little grey meddlers — it has no reason to continue withholding the truth about something that happened 45 years ago. May Glenn and Cliff, the grass roots movement there in Roswell, and all of us keep punching holes in the shroud of secrecy.

By Marshall Dudley and Michael Chorost IN THE WINTER OF 1991 we circulated a paper in manuscript claiming to have discovered 13 unusual radioactive isotopes in soil samples from an English crop circle. We argued that the isotopes were products of a type of radioac- tive bombardment called \"deuteron activation.\" We are satisfied with our logic, but, unfortunately, the basic data turned out to be less solid than we had believed. For that reason, we pulled the paper from publication, and are withdrawing some of the claims we made in it. IN THIS ARTICLE we will discuss which claims we have withdrawn, and which we are retaining. We will also discuss our data problems in some detail, so that our learning ex- perience may be shared with the cereological community. THE SOIL SAMPLES were taken from a \"fish\" formation formed on July 31/August 1, 1991 at SU 0865 6810 (near Beckhampton.) (1) On August 5th, we took two samples (named \"1A\" and \"IB\") from inside, and took a control several dozen feet away (\"1C\"). These samples were air- mailed to Tennelec/Nucleus Instruments (now renamed Ox- ford Instruments) of Oak Ridge, Tennessee. There, they were placed in a Tennelec/Nucleus LB40008 gas flow low background counter to measure their emissions of alpha and beta particles. (Alpha and beta particles make up two types of radiation.) This testing, performed on August 18th, yielded the following data: (The three tables presented in this article remain valid.) Sam- ple LA yielded alpha emissions 198% above the control and beta emissions 48% above the control. Sample IB yielded alpha emissions 103% above the control, and beta emissions 57% above the control. While we could not submit these figures to statistical analysis for significance (that requires more data), they seemed to us to be strikingly elevated. The soil in the samples was two and three times as radioactive as that of the control. We wished we had taken a second control to com- pare to the first, but nevertheless, the disparity seemed striking. We had taken two controls from another formation, made August 9/10, 1991, at SU 076 679. The controls' emissions were quite close to each other, whereas the two samples from in- side registered considerably higher. The two controls yielded alpha and beta counts within 2 % and 4% of each other. By contrast, the two samples from within the formation yielded alpha and beta counts 22% to 45% higher than the averaged controls. But perhaps the soil was more variable than we knew. Per- haps it was just a fluke that the controls were lower. In two other formations we had tested, the controls were actually somewhat higher than the samples. (2) Thus, to test soil homogeneity, one of our colleagues, Kevin Folta (a graduate student in molecular biology at the University of Illinois at Chicago), tested 20 soil samples collected in a walk around DeKalb, Illinois. The tests were made with a liquid scintilla- tion counter, which works differently from a gas flow counter, but it is relative counts that matter here. All 20 samples fell within a range of 50 to 78 counts per minute, a 28-count spread.

Folta's measurements gave us more confidence that the radiological anomalies seen in the English circles was not a fluke. (Of course, we will have to put our hypothesis to the test next summer by analyzing many more samples and controls, and that is precisely what we are planning to do.) Before going on with our discussion, we want to reassure readers that the radiological anomalies did not appear to pre- sent any health threat. Even though the samples emitted higher percentages of radiation than the control, their total emis- sions were far below the danger threshold. We are dealing with very slight effects which are detectable only by extremely sensitive instruments. It is likely that a handheld Geiger counter would not be sensitive enough to detect them. O ur hypothesis was, and still is, that there were genuine radiological anomalies in the soil from these three crop circles. But what was causing those anomalies? If the high emissions were \"smoke,\" what was the \"fire\"? To answer that question, we sent samples 1A, IB and 1C to a government laboratory for testing with a gamma spectroscope. Unlike a gas flow counter or a liquid scintillation counter, a gamma spectroscope does not measure levels of radio- activity. Rather, it finds out what is causing radioactivity. It identifies the specific radioactive isotopes within a given substance. The gamma spectroscopy was performed on August 26th, 1991. The results were supplied to us in the form of a computer-processed table of \"peaks.\" Each radioactive isotope has a characteristic signature composed of several peaks. When we first saw the data we felt sure there was something significant in it. The control had 90 peaks, and sample LA had 200 peaks! This looked like very strong evidence that there was something in the sample which was not in the control. Due to the government lab's security restrictions, we were unable to view the raw data which the computer had processed to make the table of peaks. However, we assumed that the lab had followed consistent and statistically valid procedures in processing the three samples' data, so we felt safe in work- ing with the table of peaks. We later found that this assump- tion was incorrect. Not knowing this at the time, we proceeded with our analysis. Using the peak tables, we identified 13 highly unusual radioactive isotopes in sample 1A, and one (possibly two) in IB. These isotopes were not known to be produced in nature, nor were they known to be emissions from atomic tests, nuclear power plants, or Chernobyl.

None of them held up as valid sources for the isotopes. Many of these possible sources were ruled out by the fact that many of the isotopes had halflives of about two weeks, which indicated that they had not been in existence for very long! It seemed reasonable to guess that they had been formed when the crop circle itself was. Since the 13 isotopes had one, and only one, common denominator — the property of be- ing producible by bombardment with heavy hydrogen nuclei — we proposed that that was indeed what had happened. W e were very excited by this theory, because if it was true, it meant that something extraordinarily exotic had happened when the crop circle was formed. Hoaxers could not possibly have done it. We wrote up our findings and cir- culated the manuscript quite widely. The paper was slated to be published in February 1992, but just prior to publication, we were afforded the opportunity to view the lab's raw data. We were dismayed to find that many of the peaks were so close to the noise level that we could not be confident they really existed. The lab's computer had been programmed to hunt for peaks quite aggressively, iden- tifying many of them on statistically inadequate grounds. Furthermore, the lab had made appalling errors in handl- ing the samples. Sample IB had been counted on a different detector, and with a different system, than samples 1A and 1C. We therefore had no choice but to throw IB's data out, since there was no similarly analyzed control to which it could be compared. This was dismaying but not fatal, since our analysis had focused almost entirely on sample 1A. Also, we found that the lab's computer had used different sensitivity levels to analyze the raw data for sample 1A and the control, making the analysis (the table of peaks) supplied to us useless. We pulled the paper — but we kept working on the raw data, to see what could be salvaged from it. We reanalyzed the raw data for sample 1A and the control with proper sen- sitivity levels, to pick out the peaks which were statistically valid. Once this was done, 53 peaks were left in sample 1A, and 40 were left in 1C, the control. All of these peaks were three standard deviations removed from the noise level, which meant that there was a 99.9% chance that they were not due to noise or statistical variation. The simple numerical disparity of peaks — 53 versus 40 — suggested that something was in LA which was not in 1C. Based on these peaks, we now tentatively argue that four unusual radioactive isotopes (three of which are from the original 13 isotopes) were in fact truly present in LA: vanadium-48 (half-life: 16.1 days), europium-146 (4.6 days), ytterbium-169 (32 days), and gold-192 (4.9 hours) (3). The gold-192 was present in the control as well, so we think its presence was due to contamination from the government lab. (We have several other reasons for thinking this as well, which are a little too technical to get into here.) We are still not totally satisfied with the identification of these four isotopes, since in each case we had to use one or more peaks which were less than three standard deviations from the noise. (It takes a combination of peaks to identify any given isotope.) It's rather like identifying an automobile in a snowstorm. Parts of it may be blurred, but enough of it is visible to rule out its being anything else. Parts of the isotopes were \"blurred\" — i.e., some of their peaks were at 95% confidence rather than 99.9% — but the total com- bination of peaks spoke strongly for positive identification. In addition, the alpha/beta counts suggested that there was something unusual in sample LA, and these peaks represented by far the most likely candidates. But rather than make definitive claims, we prefer to wait for next summer and do more testing. We cross-checked our conclusion in another way. The four isotopes have halflives measured in weeks to hours, so the peaks identifying them should be absent from a recount made months later. Thus we had sample 1A recounted between February 20th and 25th, 1992 (for five days, or about 6,800 minutes) on a gamma spectroscope provided by Oxford In- struments. This gave us good statistics, and we were allowed to work on the equipment ourselves, ensuring that scientific methods were employed, the correct calibration curves used, and the raw data recorded for re-examination at will. The natural radioactive isotopes we originally detected in the soil were still there, such as uranium-238 and radium-226. There was also cesium-137 from Chernobyl. These served as checks on the reliability of the original analysis. But the very peaks that identified the four unusual isotopes were gone: precise- ly those peaks, and none other. This suggests that those four isotopes had decayed off, as predicted. A lthough we suspect these isotopes were generated through activation by whatever energy source created the circle, it is possible they were caused by contamination at some point. One of the primary foci of the work in 1992 will be to analyze samples quickly after the formation is made, to avoid losing information on isotopes with short halflives. The fact that we will have a gas flow counter and a gamma spectroscope under our own control in Oxford, England, will cut the time between sampling and testing to mere hours. In addition, we plan to analyze the plant material as well, which will help us determine whether any unusual isotopes dis- covered are from activation or contamination. What lessons should we (and other cereologists) draw from our troubles? First, the recognition that scientists and scien- tific labs are fallible, too; their claims should never be un- critically accepted, but rather probed, questioned, and replicated by others. Second, that cereologists should make their raw data freely available to others for review. This enables the community to detect problematic data or invalid claims. This in fact happened to us, since it was certain skeptical responses to our manuscript that made us insist on getting to the lab's raw data. The system worked: our paper never was published. Third, the lesson that the discovery of an MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 288 April 1992"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"error constitutes an advance in knowledge. We have learned, albeit the hard way, a great deal about what assumptions not to make. F inally, we have learned not to put all our eggs in one basket. Even in our darkest moments, we were heart- ened by discoveries made by colleagues in completely dif- ferent fields. In addition to his scintillation counts, Kevin Folta examined plant DNA in samples and controls from the Argonne circle, and found that DNA from inside the circle was considerably more degraded than DNA from outside it. This suggested that the plants had been exposed to some form of radiation. Dr. W. C. Levengood of Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratories found consistent anomalies in plants from crop circles around the world, including node swelling, cell wall pit enhancement, polyembryony, increased seed germination rates, and variations of oxidation and reduction characteristics. And Cassandra McDonough of Texas A&M examined seeds under a scanning electron microscope, and found effects con- sistent with Levengood's hypothesis that the plants had been rapidly heated and cooled. (These findings are now being writ- ten up for submission to refereed journals.) In short, we learned that in cereology, diversification is critical. In the summer of 1992, we will put these lessons to good use. Those who would criticize our mistakes would do well to turn their energies in the same direction.

Nearly 300,000 words long, Emergence is a far-ranging survey of the UFO phenom- enon from before 1800 through 1959. UFOs in the 1980s, the initial volume of the series, concentrated on the major personalities, UFO sightings and research organizations that have dominated the most recent history of unidentified flying objects. It featured lengthy entries on several topics of continuing interest, including abductions, contactees, UFO crashes, earth- lights, extraterrestial biological entities and fantasy-prone personalities. Volume Two comprehensively examines the UFO phenomena prior to its identification in the public con- sciousness with \"flying saucers,\" a phrase which first surfaced in connection with Kenneth Arnold's landmark June 24, 1947, sighting. \"Anomalous Aerial Phenomena Before 1800,\" for example, reviews the widespread reports, legends and folklore of what some have speculated were early UFOs. Other lengthy entries are concerned with various aspects of 19th-century UFO sightings, including the curious tradition of \"flying ser- pent\" reports. Also included are full accounts of UFO activity from 1900 to the beginning of the UFO Age in 1947. The book concludes with a survey of the incidents, personalities and controversies that shaped and dominated the first 12 years of the modern UFO era. As in volume one of the UFO Encyclopedia, Clark presents his material objectively for readers to draw their own conclusions concerning the credibility or in- credibility of numerous claims and controversies. Clark is a former editor of Fate Magazine. He has been vice-president of the Center for UFO Studies since 1985, and currently edits the bimonthly International UFO Reporter.

This turned out to be the only major snowfall in this area that winter. From early to mid-January the weather was cold, with temperatures around freezing during the day and getting well below freezing at night. Because of the storm, I decided to put off my regular jogging routine for awhile. On January 15th, I started running again, choosing to run through the Mount Feake Cemetery, which is about a mile from where I live. The snow had a hard layer of ice on top, and some of the roads were still quite icy. Alongside the cemetery lies the Charles River. At about a mile and a half into my run, I noticed on the river off to my right an unusual circular formation in the ice. The circle was located about 40 feet out from the river bank, and I estimated the impression to be around 20 feet in diameter. The impression had a roughly circular mark in the center, a ring going around that, and a concentric ring on the out- side of that. I couldn't figure out what had happened, but the impres- sion looked to me to be melted ice, or water that did not freeze at all. There were no footprints, tracks or any sign of activi- ty near the circle; which resembled some of the crop forma- tions found in England. I went home to get my camera and returned to shoot several pictures of it. Some parts of the river were quite solid, but other areas hadn't frozen at all. I ques- tioned the safety of the ice in that area so I didn't take any pictures from the river. I didn't know who to ask about something like this, so I started first by showing the pictures to people I knew in order to get their opinions. They had not seen anything like this before, but a few thought it could have been created by a pipeline underneath the water. At that point I spoke with a woman from the Massachusetts Water Resource Association and explained to her the exact area in question, making sure she knew where I was talking about by using landmarks and so forth. I was told that there are no pipelines under the water in the area, and that if there were, they would be located 5 to 10 feet below the riverbed. After a couple of unsuccessful attempts at getting scien- tists to look at the photos, I found one who was quite willing to meet with me. Dr. Jerome P. Carr, Ph.D., who \"wears many hats,\" is a geophysicist, limnologist, oceanographer and a geologist, with other tides to his credit as well. After viewing a few of the pictures, Dr. Carr had first thought it might have been caused by a small part of an airplane that fell into the river. But he decided it probably was not because the flat bot- tom part of an airplane or wing would tumble down too slowly to make an impression like that, and he felt that a heavy piece falling from an aircraft would not likely occur. Dr. Carr believes that a meteorite may have been involved. He feels that such an object, about the size of a baseball or softball, traveling at a high rate of speed, may have hit the water, breaking through a thin layer of ice that had formed on top of the water. The circle effect, he explains, could have been the result of the action of two sets of waves: A surface wave when the object hit the water, then a compressional wave which was formed when the piece of meteorite hit the river bottom. He thought that the meteorite would have to have hit the water at about a 90-degree angle and that the snowfall of January llth would probably have come after that happened. He believes that if a meteorite had landed in the river, two waves would develop, which would break through the ice on the surface of the river, and the snow would never have ac- cumulated on the rings of water from the result of that happening. I inquired about this possibility, speaking with a couple of people who are knowledgeable on the subject of meteorites. One person I spoke with is from the Smith- sonian National Museum of Natural History, the other is an author of a book on planetary geology. I was told that there were no fireballs reported in January of 1991, and was sent some information on meteorites. It said, in part, that \"statistics over the last century indicate that about 550 meteorites fall on the earth each year, and that most of them fall into the ocean or in remote areas where they are unlikely to be ob- served. Only about 75 of them fall in areas where they might be collected, and only about 5 or 6 per year are recovered.\" It is Dr. Carr's belief that a meteorite has the velocity needed to create the two distinct sets of waves. A rock tossed into the water, he says, would not have had such an impact because it wouldn't have the same velocity as a falling meteorite. I asked him whether the ordinary rippling effect of water, from a thrown rock hitting on the surface alone, could produce that pattern. He said it would not because there would be no reason for one area to be more damaged (on the surface) than another. In other words, it fails to explain his theory for the two distinct wave patterns. Further reading of the information sent to me on meteorites differs from Dr. Carr's opinion in saying that \"the energy resulting from the high velocity of entry into the atmosphere is dissipated within a few seconds and the body then falls freely and comparatively slowly to the ground.

MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 288 April 1992"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"striking the ground may excavate small cavities, but most meteorites are found practically sitting on the surface of un- consolidated soil or snow.\" I am told that its fall would be slowed even further by the water, (which I was told by a diver later on to be about 12 to 14 feet deep), and it would likely end up sitting on the riverbed. On March 5th, with the weather warming up, I spoke with the Police Chief of the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC) regarding permission to send divers into the water. Explaining why I wanted to do this, I was told that the MDC Police Underwater Search Division were going to be having divers in the area tomorrow recovering a small sunken boat and that maybe they would check it out for me. I met with them the following day, showed them one of the pictures, told them the story, and we went to that area. They felt it was a pretty strange thing for them to be doing, but they had some extra time so they would do it. One diver went in after I had gone over with him a couple of things about the appearance of meteorites. Basically, I pretty much told him to just look for unusual rocks. He covered the spot where the circle was located, and also included an area 15 to 20 feet surrounding the circle. After 20 minutes, the diver surfaced carrying two ordinary looking rocks. These rocks looked nor- mal to me, and were later confirmed by Walter Webb as not being meteorites. The diver said that the visibility under the water was good, the bottom was smooth, and there were not many rocks down there. These rocks could have been picked up from anywhere within the fairly wide area he searched. A couple of the people I spoke with on meteorites said that a meteorite probably would not move from where it landed unless perhaps there was a strong current, which there is none. The two rocks that were found are not the type of rock that one would normally think of picking up and throwing, but that aside, I have my own reasons to question whether the impression was created by a rock. A rock, if it were thrown, would have to have been the size of a baseball or softball. But when the snow melted on the cemetery side of the river, not only could I not find any big rocks on the ground, but one would be hard-pressed to locate any small ones either. If someone had wanted to toss a rock into the water from the other side of the river, they would have had some difficulty. Given the required size and weight, it is very unlikely that this is what happened. The impres- sion is closest to the cemetery side, which means that any prankster on the far bank would face a much farther toss, one that would have to be high enough in the air so as to hit the surface of the water at a 90-degree angle. That would be very difficult indeed with a rock of the suggested size and weight. Also, if the circle was created after the eight-inch snowfall rather than before, as Dr. Carr theorizes, then any rocks on the ground would have been covered over. Something else that is probably worth noting is that there are no tree branches that overhang the river in that area. I spoke with some of the people who work in the cemetery, starting with a woman who works in the office. I showed her a picture of the circle, and asked if she knew anything about it. She hadn't seen it, nor did she have any personal information about it. But she did seem to recall a couple of people who were ice fishing in the area had mentioned see- ing the circle. I also showed the picture to some of the cemetery workers, who said they had not seen it themselves, but one of the workers mentioned it having been seen by a couple of peo- ple taking a walk in the area at the time. One of the workers said that there are underwater springs in the area. That possible explanation was suggested by a few people, one of them be- ing an anthropologist, who I was told might be able to offer some insight into the matter. The anthropologist also speculated that it might be a pipeline or a whirlpool. Dr. Carr didn't like any of those explanations, saying that in the case of a pipeline the surface current would have made the cir- cular impression very unlikely. He said it was not a whirlpool because the whole area would be melted away, not just ir- regular melting in certain spots. The underwater spring theory was discounted by him as well because the warm water from the spring below would be too dense to rise up through the cold water near the surface. (Note: More recently Dr. Carr has suggested the possibility that the ice circles could be con- nected .to some sort of electromagnetic effect, perhaps something similar to what could be causing the British crop circles.) My next idea was to pay a visit to the house that sits right across the river, thinking • perhaps they might have some knowledge of it. I rang the doorbell and a very elderly woman opened the door. With her admittedly poor eyesight she looked at the greatly enlarged photograph. She wasn't aware of the ice circle, but said she had been living there for 40 years and was certain it was caused by the wind. I thought to myself, \"the wind?\" She said, \"have you seen the way the wind blows the surface of the water?\" She handed the picture back to me, started laughing and said, \"you people ... that's the biggest laugh I've had all day.\" That part of the river froze a couple of more times during the winter, but nothing out of the ordinary was noticed.

Webb T he likely association of past mass extinctions on Earth with impacting asteroids or comets, along with the realization that such space debris continues to pose a threat, have stimulated searches for near-Earth objects. It is estimated that only about one percent of some 10,000 Earth- approaching asteroids big enough to cause large-scale damage have been detected. A University of Arizona team runs a search project atop Kitt Peak called Spacewatch. Using an automated 36-inch telescope equipped with a charge-coupled device (sensitive light detector), this group has already had a string of notable successes. In January 1991 Spacewatch discovered 1991 BA, a tiny 30-foot asteroid that passed only 106,000 miles from Earth — less than half the Moon's distance and the closest known miss by such an object (that hasn't entered our planet's atmosphere). Last October the same team detected 1991 TU, another small asteroid flying by within about 460,000 miles. And opening the new year was Spacewatch's finding of a strange reddish object 120 miles in diameter orbiting beyond Saturn. Officially designated 1992 AD, the body was nick- named \"Son of Chiron\" because of its resemblance to the odd deep-space comet Chiron discovered in 1977. But perhaps the Arizona team's most sensational discovery preceded \"Son of Chiron.\" Last November 6 James V. Scot- ti spotted a dim image streaking across the telescope's photographic field of stars. Upon determining the object's preliminary orbit^ Scotti suddenly realized that 1991 VG, as it was called, had an unusual path for an asteroid. Its orbit appeared to be very similar to Earth's. That is, the size of VG's orbit turned out to be only about five percent larger than Earth's; the orbit's shape was almost circular; and its inclined angle to Earth's orbital plane proved to be astonishingly small. (Asteroids usually have more elliptical paths and much higher inclinations.) The object itself appeared to be possibly the smallest yet discovered in space — perhaps 20 feet across. Furthermore, it was due to pass nearest the Earth on De- cember 5 at a separation of about 290,000 miles — somewhat more than the Moon's distance. As the mysterious body moved into Southern Hemisphere skies and headed toward the South Pole, Richard West of the European Southern Observatory in Chile imaged VG through a 61-inch telescope and found its brightness fluctuating rapidly (a magnitude or more), including several brilliant flashes. The light variation pattern pointed to something shiny and metallic rotating once every seven to eight minutes. (Asteroids rotate with periods no shorter than a few hours.) Additionally, VG's visible spectrum indicated a uniform colorless object, quite different from the usual asteroidal reflection. West concluded that 1991 VG was most probably an artificial body rotating about more than one axis. 1 Prior to West's observations, the Director of the Interna- tional Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center in Cam- bridge Massachusetts, Brian Marsden, told Boston Globe science reporter David Chandler: \"I don't know what it is. I've never had anything before that had an orbit so similar to Earth's.\" After speculating on what the object might be — an unusual asteroid or a rocket stage from an old space mission — Marsden said there was one other option: \"It could be an alien spacecraft, but I don't want to think about that!\" 2 Marsden's calculations indicated that the object arrived in its current orbit in the astronomically recent past and in fact appeared to pass Earth every 16 years or so. Using that estimate, the astronomer checked into the possibility that VG might be a rocket from an early interplanetary or lunar space mission. Looking back in time, Marsden sought candidate launches during the 16-year intervals of the mid-1970s and late '50s. Suspects included the Centaur upper stage of the Helios 1 mission, Pioneer 4's upper rocket, and several Soviet Luna missions. While even a secret U.S. or Soviet military mission couldn't be ruled out, none of the candidates could be identified with certainty. \"I think it's brought out the question that we aren't ade- quately cataloging the artificial junk that's being sent into heliocentric orbit,\" Marsden told Science News. \"When something has gone around the Sun ... and come back to haunt us, I think it's something to think about.\" 3 F ollowing the unknown space visitor's closest approach, attempts were made in both hemispheres to recover it optically and by radar. Radar especially might help resolve the mystery of whether 1991 VG was a rock or a rocket. Un- fortunately, neither the European Southern Observatory nor radar antennas at Goldstone, California and Arecibo, Puerto Rico were able to find the object again. Marsden was once more interviewed by the Boston Globe. The astronomer said: \"We are dealing with some very peculiar object. I would say man-made. I think it would be hard to explain this kind of (light) variation with a natural object, even a small one.\" Referring to the failure to recover the ob- ject, Marsden joked: \"Maybe that's why they couldn't be found last night. Maybe they landed!\" 4 In 1960 and again in 1975, 5 Stanford radio astronomer Ronald Bracewell proposed the concept of alien robot probes sent out to sunlike stars by members of a \"galactic club\" (federa- tion of advanced intelligences).

He still relieved VG was likely an unidentified rocket stage from some unmanned solar-system mission launched in the 1970s or even earlier. The optical flash pattern indicated to him the uncon- trolled tumbling of a rocket. I asked him point-blank about the alien probe hypothesis. Rather than dismissing the no- tion outright, Marsden carefully considered the question. While he didn't think it was very likely that VG was an alien probe, he didn't rule it out either. The astronomer remarked that even from a remote flyby distance, a probe could collect meaningful data about our planet. I asked whether there had been any reports during VG's brief pre-encounter of the ob- ject accelerating or decelerating (as if under control). Marsden responded negatively. In conclusion, while VG's possible identity as an alien probe can't be totally ruled out, the scientific principle of Occam's Razor dictates that an as-yet unidentified rocket stage of earth- ly origin is the simplest, most reasonable hypothesis to ac- count for this space visitor.

Direct manuscripts and letters to the editor to: Editor MUFON UFO Journal Box 12434 San Antonio Texas 78212 ASTEROID HOAX STORY Last year copies of a clipping allegedly from the New York Times and dated October 6, 1977, made the rounds of various ufologists. The story related how an object \"from beyond the solar system\" was heading straight for Earth and was due to settle into an orbit around our planet \"on or about October 25 [1977].\" While the discoverer of this object, a \"Dr. Moffatt\" of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, ex- plained it as an interstellar asteroid or comet, \"Dr. Rood\" of the British Interplanetary Society believed the visitor's course and rate of deceleration meant it was \"an intelligently guided vehicle.\" I was suspicious of this tale from the start. First of all, I would have known of such an explosive discovery through the International Astronomical Union's Cir- culars and from astronomical journals. Secondly, the names quoted in the story were unfamiliar. And, last- ly, there was no evidence of any follow-up stories after the object went into Earth orbit. As reported in the January /February 1992 issue of UFO magazine, 6 Don Ecker checked the New York Times Index and microfiche copies for the edition in question and found that no such story had appeared in the newspaper in 1977. Someone had cleverly reproduced the Time's type style and fabricated a hoax story! I also called Brian Marsden, who directs both the IAU Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams (reports astronomical discoveries) and the Minor Planet Center. The story had come to his attention last year as well. Marsden confirmed that the scientists named in the article were fictitious, and the piece was a clever hoax. I would like to expose the culprit.

The effort began in July during the Mutual UFO Network Annual Symposium meeting in Chicago. Representatives of the Fund, the Center and the Roswell case investigators met to discuss the reported 1947 crash of a UFO on The Plains of San Agustin, 150 miles west of the well-documented crash site in Corona. Although there is disagreement about the quality of the evidence for a second crash, representatives of the two organizations agreed to support the continuing investigation. On July 24, 1991, the only known living first-hand witness who allegedly was involved in the events, Gerald Anderson, was the subject of a polygraph examination conducted by a certified polygraph examiner in Kansas City, MO. The pro- ject was coordinated by nuclear physicist Stanton Friedman and the costs were paid for by the Fund. The examiner con- cluded that there was no evidence of deception in Anderson's account. This is the first time any witness in the Roswell case has taken — and passed — a polygraph examination. During the fall, representatives of the Fund and the Center discussed the possibility of sponsoring a conference to pro- vide for a full exchange of evidence concerning the Plains of San Agustin account. At this writing, the conference is scheduled to be held in mid-February. Attendance will be by invitation only and a report on the proceedings will be available as soon as possible after the meeting. Also during this period, the Fund's Executive Committee received six new grant proposals for further research into UFO crash/retrieval cases, including the Roswell case, totalling more than $30,000. The Executive Committee approved all of them and forwarded those involving expenditures of more than $1000 to the National Board for review. By the end of December, most of them had been approved, subject to the availability of funds. An appeal was mailed to the Fund's donor list and to CUFOS Associates requesting additional support for the ongoing investigation. A second videotape of first- hand witnesses to the retrieval of UFO wreckage and alien bodies was offered to contributors of $50 or more. To date, the fund has spent more than $50,000 on the Roswell case, making it the most expensive civilian UFO case investiga- tion ever conducted. Circles & Soviets Two projects supported by the Fund were completed dur- ing this period: Michael Chorost's analysis of crop circles in England during the summer of this year and Ann Druf- fel's excellent report on an alleged \"missing fetus\" UFO ab- duction case. Both reports are how available to the Fund's contributors (because of its brevity, Mrs. Druffel's report will be sent — free of charge — to anyone purchasing another report from our available list). We're pleased to report that our appeal for contributions to support the Donald E. Key hoe Journalism Award exceeded our goal to raise at least $2,000 to provide significant recogni- tion for the best articles or stories printed or broadcast on the UFO subject during the 1991 calendar year. The purpose of the award is to encourage quality journalism and solid in- vestigative reporting into the UFO phenomenon by reporters for daily and weekly newspapers, as well as magazines, and television and radio news operations. Judging for the 1991 Keyhoe Award will take place early in 1992. D uring this period David Schwartzman, Ph.D., resigned from the National Board. He was replaced by Thomas E. Bullard, Ph.D., an assistant professor of folklore at the University of Indiana and a recognized authority on UFO ab- duction cases. Also during this period, the Fund for UFO Research joined with the Center for UFO Studies and the Mutual UFO Net- work to help form the Joint American-Soviet Aerial Anoma- ly Federation, which was initiated by Richard Haines, Ph.D. (a member of the Fund's National Board). The primary pur- pose of the organization is to foster an exchange of informa- tion between major UFO organizations in both countries. The breakup of the Soviet Union into the Commonwealth of In- dependent States is not expected to affect this unprecedented effort of international cooperation in solving the UFO mystery. Late in 1991 the Fund acquired five theses prepared by students attending the U.S. Air Force Air University and Staff College between 1968 and 1974. Two of the theses are highly interesting, because they are extremely critical of the Air Force's official position on the UFO question. The Fund is publishing the two best papers and will make the others available upon request. Fund for UFO Research P.O.

Olavick and Mrs. William Down spotted an unusual, isolated cloud in a completely cloudless sky over Tucson, Arizona. They described it as being \"steamy and fleecy.\" In and out of the cloud moved a number of dull-white disci ike objects that rose and fell in an erratic manner, occasionally disappearing into or above the cloud. Mrs. Olavick said that the objects were round in planform but were not spherical, for they frequently tipped a bit, exposing a flattened-sphere form. She estimated that they watched the objects cavorting near the cloud for perhaps five or six minutes before the en- tire group suddenly disappeared within the cloud or perhaps above it. After a: minute or so,, a new object, perhaps three or four times as large as the little objects, came out of the cloud on its east side. After it emerged, the small objects began to emerge also, taking up a V-formation pattern behind it. The V comprised a line of four-abreast just to the rear of the large object, then a line of three-abreast behind that, and finally two-abreast in the rear. This permitted the first accurate count of small objects, nine in all. No sooner had the last pair emerged than all 10 objects shot off to the northeast, climb- ing out of sight in about two or three seconds. (\"UFOs: What To Do,\" published by the Rand Corporation, 11/27/68) April 1952 • Secretary of the Navy Dan Kimball was fly- ing to Hawaii (date unknown) when two disc-shaped craft streaked in toward his Navy executive plane. \"Their speed was amazing,\" Kimball said. \"My pilots estimated it between 1500 and 2000 miles per hour. The objects circled us twice and then took off, heading east. There was another Navy plane behind us, with Admiral Arthur Radford on board. The distance was about 50 miles. I had my senior pilot radio a report on the sighting. In almost no time Radford's chief pilot called back, really excited. The UFOs were now circling their plane, having covered the 40 miles in less than two minutes. In a few seconds the pilot told us they'd left the plane and raced up out of sight.\" (Aliens From Space, by Major Donald Keyhoe) • A strange oval-shaped object was reported seen high in the sky over Benson, Arizona on the third. At least four men connected with Marana Air Force Base, about 20 miles north- west of Tucson, reported seeing the object. Chick Logan, a civilian flight commander, described it as five or six times as large as a B-29 Superfortress, oblong in shape, and without wings or other projections. \"It was not like a disc,\" Logan said, \"but more oblong ... I flew as high as I could to 14,000 feet and it appeared to be at least 40,000 feet higher than that. It was real bright and shone like polished aluminum,\" he said. \"I'll tell you, I have been flying for 25 years now, and I have never seen anything like it.\" (The Examiner, San Francisco, CA, 4/4/52) • UFOs were reported in the area of the Nevada atomic test site on the 17th. An Air Force technical sergeant and four civilian workers at the Nellis Air Force Base, near Las Vegas, said they saw 18 circular objects flying an easterly course which carried them over or very close to the test site at 12:05 p.m. The men watched the discs for about 30 seconds and estimated that the craft were 40,000 feet up and flying at a speed of at least 1200 mph. The objects flew an irregular for- mation with one of them off to the right, moving with a zig- zag motion. They left no smoke or vapor. (Examiner, San Francisco, CA, 4/18/52) April 1957 • Radar stations throughout Great Britain were alerted to look for a mysterious flying object tracked by Air Ministry observers over southwest Scotland on the fourth. Three radar operators reported independently that the object flashed across their screens traveling at 60,000 feet. The operators said the object suddenly dived to a height of 14,000 feet, made two whirls, then vanished to the south. The ob- ject was sighted by two lonely radar posts in Scotland's hilly Wigtownshire. A Royal Air Force station near Luce Bay on the southwestern tip of Scotland also caught it on radar. It was last reported headed towards the Isle of Man. Royal Air Force officials said no planes were in the area at the time. The UFO was described as too fast, too big and too maneuverable to have been a plane. (The News, Santa Barbara, CA, 4/7/57; Flying Saucers Journal, New Zealand, Second Quarter, 1957) • On the 14th, a metallic-like craft in the form of a big top about five feet tall, reportedly landed on a road about 300 feet from two elderly French country women at Vins sur Caramy, France. Just as it landed, a deafening rattle was heard coming from a metallic road sign some 15 to 20 feet from the landing site. The sign had been set into violent vibration. The cries of the women and the noise from the sign were heard by a man nearly 1000 feet away. Thinking that there had been an accident, he rushed over, arriving in time to see the top jump off the road to a height of about 20 feet, turn, and land a second time, this time on another road, which forked from the first. As it turned, it flew over a second road sign, and this one likewise vibrated violently, resonating as though it had been subjected to violent shocks repeated at a rapid cadence. The UFO, however, made no sound itself. The local police and a UFO investigator reportedly placed a compass near the two signs and found a deviation of some 15 degrees. The French police adjutant in the area vouched for the integrity of the witnesses. He affirmed their good faith and said they were above any suspicion of a hoax.

Allen Hynek) MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 288 April 1992"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"• At 11:52 a.m. on the 19th, the Japanese fishing boat Kit- sukawa Maru was enroute to Japan from the South Pacific Ocean. The bosun and four crew members spotted two metallic, very silvery craft descending from the sky and sud- denly dive into the water at about 143-30 E., and 31-15 N. After the craft submerged, a violent turbulence occurred under the surface where the objects vanished. The bosun thought at first the UFOs were jet planes, but they had no wings and were approximately 10 meters long. His boat searched the area but found no wreckage. (S.P.A.C.E. magazine, July 1957) April 1962 • About 7:30 p.m. on the 18th, something ex- ploded over southwestern Nevada. It shook the earth. It was as brilliant as an atomic blast. Reporters for the Las Vegas Sun immediately launched an investigation. Was the object a meteor? The reporter who called Nellis Air Force Base evidently took them by surprise, for he was told: \"There's only one thing wrong with that (the meteor theory), a meteor cannot be tracked by radar and this thing was.\" How much radar tracking had been done on the strange glowing object before it exploded over the Mesquite Range in Nevada? The North American Air Defense Command (NORAD) in Col- orado Springs, Colorado was contacted. The spokesman there was Lieutenant Colonel Hurbert Rolph. He told newsmen that the Air Defense Command had been alerted by the fire trail of this, strange object. The first report had come from Oneida, New York, where watchers had detected a glowing red object moving deeper into the United States and apparently at great altitude. As the intruder penetrated deeper into the Midwest, NORAD ad- mittedly alerted its bases (including Nellis Air Force Base), and jet interceptors had been scrambled from Phoenix, Arizona to intercept the aerial intruder. Radar tracking had determined that is was neither plane, missile, satellite, nor meteor. It was therefore listed as a UFO and tracked as far west as Gridley, Kansas. It turned northwest and descended until it was lost from the radar screens. A few minutes later a UFO landed near an electric power substation at Eureka, Utah. The Air Force spokesman at Stead Air Force Base in Reno admitted that the object had landed and that the power substation had not been in operation dur- ing the 42 minutes the object was on the ground near it. He also told newsmen that the presence of this object had not been admitted to until the power station was in operation again, after the object had left. The nature of the object which landed was not revealed, because the UFO did not remain there. Jets were pursuing it over southwestern Nevada, after the Eureka incident, when the object exploded in a blinding flash which resembled an atomic explosion. All these things happened on the night of April 18, 1962, and were confirmed by official spokesmen for the U.S. Air Force. The incident received no national news coverage. For- tunately, The Las Vegas Sun checked the story and gave it the front page banner headlines it deserved. (Strange World and Flying Saucers — Serious Business by Frank Edwards) April 1967 • John H. Demler, a Justice of the Peace, was driving about half a mile from his home in Jonestown Penn- sylvania at 7:45 p.m. on the fifth when his car engine miss- ed three times. \"It then stopped and the car lights went out,\" Demler said. \"At the same time I saw an object coming toward the car about 20 feet above the street.\" The slow moving UFO was approximately 30 feet across and looked like it had lights in back of a painted black glass. It flew over the car as Demler lowered his window and noticed a smell of sulphar and oil. It also emitted a sound like an electric motor running. The object came to a stop alongside the car, tilted, started off slow- ly, then put on such a terrific burst of speed that Demler and his car seemed to be pulled to it. The witness said the car settled down so fast that he was moved all the way across the front seat. \"My condition was all nerves the next day,\" Demler said. \"I was wet with perspiration until about 4 p.m. The skin peeled off my hands and feet.\" (Strange Effects From UFOs, a NICAP Special Report) • Scores of Ohio River valley residents reported seeing a huge object flying up the river on the 17th. Lewis Summers of New Haven, West Virginia spotted and pursued the UFO in his car about 8:45 p.m. Estimated to be as big as a C-45 aircraft at an altitude of 500 feet, the object emitted two shafts of light from its underside. At one point, Summers stopped his car and flashed the headlights off and on several times. The shafts of light from the craft also were turned off and on several times. Three miles north of New Raven, a young boy in a pony-drawn wagon broke his glasses when the animal bucked upon seeing the UFO, wrecking the wagon. The youngster's father did not believe his story until the horse was found on the ground with its feet sticking straight up. The animal reportedly suffered no lasting ill effect. (Strange Ef- fects From UFOs, a NICAP Special Report) • A school principal and his companions (in another car) were driving near Jefferson City, Missouri about 9 p.m. on the 17th, when they spotted an object shaped something like a WW I helmet coming over the top of a cliff. The object, estimated to be 300 feet in diameter, passed directly overhead on its flight path towards the airport. The top of the car seemed to have no effect in holding out the brilliant light radiating from the UFO. When the driver looked at his hands, it looked like he was looking at X-ray plates of his hands. As the ob- ject passed over the airport it was observed by several witnesses on the ground and the crew of an Ozark Airlines plane approaching the airport for a landing. (The UFO Ex- perience, by Dr. J. Allen Hynek) April 1977 • In one of the strangest UFO sightings on record, a Chilean soldier who disappeared in an eerie violet glow, apparently lost five days and 15 minutes from his life! The soldier, a corporal, went to investigate a powerful, violet, oval-shaped light that suddenly appeared one night hovering near his unit's post. All of the members of the unit saw it and stood, startled, in combat readiness. When the corporal MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 288 April 1992"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"returned, 15 minutes later, his mind was a blank, his calen- dar watch had advanced by five days, and he had a sudden, five-day growth of beard on his face! \"All I remember is walk- ing away from my soldiers toward the light, then I lost my mind,\" said Cpl. Armando Valdes. \"They say I disappeared like magic. All I can say is something called me. It was an internal communication between the light and myself. When I returned, the date on my watch had gone forward five days in 15 minutes. They tell me I looked like I hadn't shaved for five days.\" The event started at about 3:50 a.m. on the 25th, near a secret army post at Pampa Lluscoma, close to the Bolivian border, where a patrol was on duty. The men were stunned to see, just 1600 feet away, the oval object, some 230 feet in circumference and bathing a wide area in bright violet light. At each end of the object were two small revolving red discs. \"Our corporal told us that we must believe in God and that nothing was going to happen to us,\" said soldier Raul Vas- quez in a statement recorded on tape before a ban on inter- views was imposed by President and Commander in Chief General Augusto Pinochet. \"The corporal went toward it and when he reappeared he was trembling and laughing with a different voice.\" Soldier Ivan Robles said: \"He seemed out of his mind and did not recognize anybody.\" Cpl. Valdes then fell unconscious. When he recovered, he mounted a horse and galloped to the tiny village of Putre in order to tell his story to schoolteacher Pedro Araneda, former- ly a lecturer at the University of Chile. Araneda said: \"The corporal felt I was the only one who would be able to ex- plain the mystery. I was surprised at his appearance, because he had a beard of around six or seven days growth and I knew the soldiers had to shave every day. I took my camera and tape recorder to the scene. All ,the men told the same story. I believe that the soldiers' story is genuine because I was in the area two or three hours after it happened and they all said the same thing. They were all shocked, almost in a state of panic.\" (The Journal, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 5/23/77; The News, San Antonio, TX, 5/23/77; The Cronica, Buenos Aries, Argentia, 5/22/77; National Enquirer, 6/28/77) LETTERS Dear Editor: Thank you for running John White's excellent article \"Aliens Among Us — A UFO Conspiracy Hypothesis in a Religious Mode.\" I must, however, take issue with your disclaimer re the religious theory (or is the real issue the conspiracy aspect?) Why should religion be ruled out of an investigation of this confounding, monumental and earthshaking subject? It seems to be generally agreed among UFO researchers that there is definitely a supernatural, metaphysical or paranormal aspect to this experience, as well as an insidious and sinister one. I doubt whether I stand alone in wanting to read more of John White's articles.

In fact, we had come to almost the same conclusion before reading John White's article. As to the \"hypothetical Satan\" label you seem to fear, why is this out of the realm of possibility? One does not have to be a serious student of eschatology to come to the realiza- tion that some day there will be an \"end time\" as spoken of in the book of Revelations of the Bible, and that Satan is very real. One certainly hopes it does hot happen during our time, but the possibility cannot be discounted as it involves our very raison d'etre. I for one would like to read more of John White's articles (forewarned is forearmed), and if you disagree so strongly why don't you rebut him in the Journal and take the space to cite your \"reasons too long and complex to enter into\"?

Budd first challenges the source of the information. He stated that the validity he would ascribe to the information would depend on its source. In the article I included communications received during on- board experiences, telepathically received between ex- periences and even a few examples of channeled material. I included different methods of receipt because my research indicates that the method does not necessarily matter. The correlation between communications indicates that the infor- mation received is a valid part of the data we collect from the people who are having the experiences. We must never ever ignore data. This is a cardinal sin of any researcher/scien- tist no matter how lengthy our experience or reputation. However, Budd makes a good point; the correlations do not prove the truth or falsity of the information. Some ab- duction/contact/channel cases may contain deceptive infor- mation. The operative words in the last sentence are \"some\" and \"may.\" We should not, under any circumstances, believe something without proof. We have used correlations as our strongest evidence for the validity of all other aspects of the abduction phenomenon; why are communications data treated so differently? Perhaps it is because of the profound phil- osophical or personal nature of the information. After all, it took humanity 200 years to accept that the earth was not flat. I also do not feel it is scientifically sound to make sweep- ing general statements like, \"Never believe a thing you are told by either an alien or a government source.\" Even if everything we know about alien activity is consistently in- consistent, this can still tell us many things about how they think and operate. Lastly, Budd suggests that we \"develop a personal, highly critical truth-detecting system, and refuse to defer automatically to either alien or goverment 'authorities'.\" I say this is good advice, but let's take it one step further. One of the strongest legs science stands on is \"Review of its peers.\" I wholeheartedly invite other researchers to get involved with the \"Ask the Aliens\" concept and/or compare their files with the informa- tion from my article to see if correlations exist for them too. Obviously, if you are not considering all the data received from your abductees because of some rigid paradigm problem, then the previous invitation cannot apply to you. In closing I would like to say that if we, as researchers, ignore, communications out of hand, then we are ignoring a viable and recurring set of data about alien activity and have ourselves become a-part of the coverup.

Belvedere, Springfield, MO 65807. . — Forest Crawford Dear Editor: I'm new to MUFON, and I hate to jump into the middle of an argument without having all the facts, but I have to take exception to an argument used by Mr. Philip Klass in a letter published in the February issue of the Journal. With regard to a letter from a \"nonexistent\" Maj. Thomas Shively, Mr. Klass contends \"Even cursory examination ... reveals that its 'Department of the Air Force' letterhead is significantly fainter than the typewritten text, showing the let- terhead is a hoax photocopy.\" Mr. Klass' argument appears to be based on an erroneous assumption about the letterhead. Department of the Air Force letterheads are printed in blue, not black, ink. Consequent- ly, such letterheads always photocopy lighter than text which is typewritten in black. Working in the defense industry, I have had many oppor- tunities to copy such letterheads. Newer copiers reproduce the blue better than older technology, but in no case does the blue reproduce as dark as black. The Department of Defense often distributes photocopies as originals, in which case even an authentic original can have the appearance Mr. Klass complains of. Certainly an undoc- tored photocopy of an original would have that appearance. — Susan Civil Round Rock, TX Dear Editor: Upon receiving our second issue of the MUFON UFO Jour- nal we were delighted to learn that another reader shares our mutual feelings concerning the contents chosen to be printed in the Journal, the latter being (if I may quote the reader's words which support our feelings), \"an unalloyed mix of con- flicting individual hypotheses and conclusions, (which) are increasingly resorting to personal allegations and rebuttals couched in vituperative and deprecatory tones.\" (R. H. Cod- dington, Richmond, VA). Our first issue, Jan. 92, left us somewhat baffled over most of the articles, since as newcomers to MUFON we had no idea what those subjects were about; it being only obvious that some mud-slinging was going on. Even then I was begin- ning to wonder what our subscription fee was buying us. With the arrival of our next issue, Feb. 92, we found more of the same. Yet we were happy to know that we aren't an isolated case with our feelings, as R. H. Coddington demonstrated so clearly in his letter in that same issue. We did, however, enjoy the first article of each issue, i.e., \"Brazil Still UFO Hot Spot\" and \"Light Show Over Lan- caster,\" and found them to be a learning benefit as well, as adding to our overall awareness of what is occurring in the UFO arena. We feel there are not enough pages of the Jour- nal dedicated to this type of informative reporting. It is far outweighed by the mud-slinging pages. We do not advocate omitting completely from the Journal such articles, but we do suggest that having a section of the Journal set aside for such debates be considered, and that you add more pages of informative reports as well as, perhaps, MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 288 April 1992"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"excerpts from books and videos (not just \"reviews\" of them) and lectures from former MUFON meetings.

Certainly, while you do not have all the answers, you do have a lot of information on file that can be printed in the Journal for greater awareness of the enigma. And isn't that the intent of the Journal in the first place? It is hoped by us that UFO investigators, researchers and reporters will duly recognize that the hand with the finger pointing at the possible Machiavellian methods being deployed upon the general public by national and international govern- mental, political, and militia agencies may be falling into the same syndrome, with three fingers pointing back at them.

If we are going to pull it off successfully, we must pull together cooperatively. — Dorothy & Ray Lahman Ookala, Hawaii Dear Editor: I was interested to note the editorial/article by Wim van Utrecht on the Belgian UFO wave. Having returned recently from a research and fact-finding tour of Belguim, I would like to offer the following clarifications and comments: Con- trary to the impression given by Wim van Utrecht, SOBEPS has honestly and credibly investigated .the UFO wave, and has not promoted it in order to increase sightings. SOBEPS is without a doubt the most scientific, credible and profes- sional general UFO research organization in the world to- day. Their scientists and investigators are truly top-notch, and they are respected by the general population, the military and other scientists. We were singularly impressed with their in- tegrity and sincerity and by the unimpeachable quality of their investigators. Regarding Dr. Meessen, we found him to be honest, forth- coming and objective. His conclusions concerning the radar tapes of the UFO as being \"non-terrestrial\" are fully in keep- ing with the facts of the case. He is a scientist of high in- tegrity and his analysis and conclusions are both accurate and thorough. Concerning the UFO evidence, far from it being \"impossi- ble to solidify eyewitness accounts with substantial evidence,\" the evidence is both strong and of a very high quality. There is at least one photograph of the UFO which has been analyzed in detail and which is authentic. The radar tape has also been analyzed and, while analysis continues by the military, it has been appropriately concluded that the tape shows a craft with performance characteristics beyond that of any man-made craft. In addition to this radar tape, it must be remembered that this same craft has been seen on radar on more than one oc- cassion, and neither NATO, nor the Belgian Air Force, has been able to explain it as a man-made aircraft. Beyond all this, we were able to personally interview highly credible witnesses, including police officers, scientists and members of the general public who have seen this craft at close range. This craft is real, structured, completely silent and possesses performance characteristics which Northrop and McDonnell Douglas can only dream about. The notion that this craft may be a \"balloon or giant glider\" is inconsis- tent with the fact that this craft has been observed hovering motionless in winds exceeding 50 mph. And we spoke to no police or civilian officials who regarded this craft as being consistent with the F-117A, A-12 Avenger or TR-3A Black Manta. Finally, the article gives the impression that this UFO wave ended in June of 1991; actually, the wave continues unabated to this day, with sightings continuing as recently as February 1992. We will be preparing a report of our research findings in the near future and would be happy to share them with your readers should you so desire. Thank you. — Steven M. Greer, M.D. Director, the Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence Asheville, North Carolina NEWS RELEASE CBS-TV has produced the first UFO related miniseries, which will air as two two-hour episodes on Sunday, May 17th, and Tuesday, May 19th of this year. Titled \"In- truders,\" and based on the best-selling book of the same name by Budd Hopkins, the made-for-TV film will star Richard Crenna and Elizabeth Blakely in the lead roles. Considering that the month of May is network TV's sweepstakes' rating period, CBS is obviously staking at least a part of its popularity on the UFO subject. Jim Moore of KHOU-TV in Houston, Texas, has been contracted by CBS to produce several promotional segments for \"Intruders\" prior to the air date. Walt An- drus was videotaped on March 18th. In addition, Mr. Moore plans to interview Dr. David Jacobs, Budd Hopkins and Dr. John E. Mack. He will also visit Gulf Breeze, Florida, in the hopes of successfully capturing that notorious UFO on tape. Dates and times for the promotional segments are not known as of thjs writing, but keep tuned to CBS start- ing about the second week in May. What with \"Intruders\",the miniseries and the recent rash of sightings in both Pennsylvania and New Hamp- shire, 1992 promises to be a significant year for ufology. The Journal will publish an article about the numerous close encounter cases that occurred on the night of February 5, 1992, in Williamsport, PA, when Samuel Greco, Ph.D., completes his many interviews. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 288 April 1992"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"THE NIGHT SKY By Walter N. Webb May 1992 • Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Jupiter (magnitude -2.1) resumes eastward motion in Leo. The bright yellowish object can be seen high in the South at dusk. It is above the quarter Moon on the 10th. • Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars, in Pisces, has brightened to magnitude 1.0. The red planet rises about 3:30 daylight time in midmonth and re- mains low in the East at dawn. Jupiter sets in the West about 2:30 in mid-May. Saturn (0.7), in Capricornus, rises in the East about 1:30 in midmonth and has moved to the SE by dawn. The ringed world begins retrograding westward on the 29th. It can be seen near the quarter Moon on May 23. • Meteor Shower For the first time in three years, the May Aquarids won't be spoiled by moonlight. Since the shower's radiant point in Aquarius doesn't rise until 2:30 AM, this is a morning display with peak numbers of about 20 per hour reached toward dawn on May 4. (The May Aquarids are even bet- ter in the Southern Hemisphere where the radiant is much higher in the sky.) This shower makes up for its paucity by the meteors' spectacular long yellow paths, about a third of them leaving behind persistent glowing \"trains.\" • Moon Phases: r . First quarter — May 9 Full moon — May 16 Last quarter — May 24 € O New moon — May 31 The Stars: Late in the evening we get our last glimpse of the winter stars Procyon, Pollux and Castor the Twins, and Capella, as they sink into the NW. (Dazzling Sirius sets earlier, around 9 PM daylight time.) Bright orange Arcturus, in kite-shaped Bootes, and blue-white Spica, in Virgo, hover around the meridian in the South. Meanwhile, that harbinger of summer, the Summer Triangle (Vega, Deneb, Altair), has popped up above the NE horizon (11 PM). Red Antares, the scorpion's heart, is visible low in the SE. The planet Jupiter and the planetoid Vesta continue their fine show in the constellation of Leo. From May 26-29 Vesta can be found 2-3° SE of the star Theta Leonis (lion's hind leg) and near a triangle of three relatively bright galaxies. While the 7th-magnitude planetoid is visible through binoculars, you'll want a small telescope to view the fuzzy glows of the galaxies M 65, M 66, and NGC 3628. Vesta passes right in front of the last galaxy on the 27th (at R.A. llh 20m, Dec. High in the North the Big Dipper is poised upsidedown in its best viewing position of the year.

This will not change his status on the Board of Directors. It will continue to be an elected office every four years by the Canadian members. MUFON 1993 Symposium Mark Blashak, Virginia State Director, proudly announces that the MUFON 1993 International UFO Symposium has been contracted for July 2, 3 and 4 at the Hyatt Richmond Hotel in Richmond, Virginia. It is essential that we schedule our annual symposia several years in advance in order to ob- tain the most desirable and convenient facilities. We are waiting to receive bids from Austin, Texas for 1994 and Seattle, Washington in 1995, since both cities have expressed an in- terest in hosting the international symposium. National UFO Information Week MUFON's annual UFO Information Week is scheduled for August 9 through 16, 1992. In order to secure space at shopping malls, libraries, and public facilities, we have found that it is essential to make arrangements and reser- vations now. Shopping malls, in particular, normally need six months advance notice to plan their advertising and sales promotions. MUFON Annual UFO Award Recently MUFON has been awarding a plaque honoring that person deemed the most instrumental in advancing the science of ufology. The Fund for UFO Research has provided a monetary prize to accompany this award, made in the name of Isabel Davis. The MUFON Board of Directors mandated in 1987 that only current members of the Board were authorized to nominate candidates for this prestigious award. Individual members may propose names of people who have made significant accomplishments through their regional director or any member of the board of directors. A short paragraph elaborating upon the achievements of each candidate should accompany the nomination. This is a golden opportunity to publicly recognize our UFO colleagues for their dedicated work in ufology. All nominations must be received in Seguin, Texas by April 18, 1992 so ballots may be printed and enclosed with the mail- ing of the May 1992 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal. All Journal subscribers will then have an opportunity to vote for the person who they feel merits this prestigious award for 1991-1992. The award will be presented on July 11, 1992 at the MUFON 1992 International UFO Symposium in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Each board member should respond immediately with their personal nominations and then forward the names of candidates proposed by the membership as they are re- ceived before the deadline date. This is just one of the means for thanking our colleagues for a job well done. Field Investigator's Exam Shirley Coyne, Director of Field Investigator Training, advised that 127 members passed the MUFON field in- vestigators exam in 1991. The improved test scores reflect the results of Field Investigator Training Classes. Consequent- ly, the demand for MUFON Field Investigator's Manuals has increased dramatically necessitating publishing 500 additional copies of the third edition of the manual. In the meantime, work continues behind the scenes to compose and publish a new fourth edition, reflecting advances in state-of-the-art ufology. No one should delay training classes under the pretense of waiting for the upcoming fourth edition, since the third edition is still the world leader in its field. Solving Our Dirty Secret In the March 1992 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal Dan Wright, Deputy Director, Investigations, pointed out a very serious weakness in reporting abduction cases for entry into the MUFON computerized case field. Since then, Dan has personally telephoned several of the leading abduction re- searchers who not only recognized the problem but confirmed that they would need help from members to transcribe thousands of hours of audio-taped recordings of hypnotic regression sessions. While surveying the stenographic and transcribing talent within our membership, it became obvious that we have many people capable of grappling with this monumental task. The only equipment needed would be a typewriter, tape recorder with an earphone and a conscientious attitude. Your Internationa] Director will serve as the collection point for all of the individuals who would like to volunteer to work on this important and intriguing adventure. Please mail me a postcard or a short note briefly identifying your skills and sincere desire to help us with this massive project. By assign- ing the tapes to the many individuals, no one will be over burdened — just keep the postcards coming. MUFON Patches Available William J. Chapleau, Vermont State Director, purchased a large number of MUFON triangular shaped patches that were designed to be sewn on jackets, shirts, ballcaps, etc. to identify MUFON members especially when conducting investigations or for public events. Each embroidered cloth patch is an equilaterial triangle four and one-fourth inches on a side. The inscription depicts our name \"Mutual UFO Network,\" the MUFON logo and the name of your state across the bottom of the pyramid.
