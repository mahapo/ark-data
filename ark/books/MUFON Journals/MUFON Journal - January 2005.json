As most of you know, the hard work really starts after the report is in the hands of the state directors, assistant state directors, state section direc- tors, and field investigators. They go into the field to meet the witnesses and obtain their reports, photos, videos, and physical evi- dence. This is probably the most interesting and ex- citing work that is done by MUFON. Then we bring the results of the in- vestigations to the pages of the Jour- nal after the investigations are finished and the reports are submitted. Along with all of the investigative information, it helps us get the reports to the Jour- nal readers more rapidly if a narrative version of the investigation is included John Schuessler in the final report.

Spacing problem Journal readers may have noticed a little extra white space between articles in the December issue. This was a pro- duction problem and should not occur again. Our Journal editor produced a prop- erly spaced layout, but when it was con- verted for printing the spacing went awry. The good news is that the excel- lent content was still all there.

E. Puthoff. Introduction The ever recurring question of why Earth has seemingly not been visited by extraterrestrials (ETs) has received considerable discussion under the topic of \"Fermi's paradox.\" The problem originated as a quip by Enrico Fermi to colleagues in Los Alamos over lunch one day in 1950. Whether one assumes the existence of only one other ci vilization or of many alien civilizations in our Milky Way galaxy, and whether one assumes colo- nization involving interstellar travel at near-light speed or far below, diffusion modeling predicts colonization or at least visitation of all habitable planets in the galaxy on timescales of tens of millions of years, far less than the ap- proximate 13 x 10 9 year age of the gal- axy itself. Thus the paradox: Where are they[l]? Theoretical possibilities unknown to Fermi make the paradox even stronger today. One can now rationally conjec- ture about prospects afforded by adja- cent M-brane universes [2]. Indeed, if the multidimensions underlying superstring and M-brane theory are cor- rect, there could be inhabited universes separated from our own by minute, or- thogonal distances. Also, anthropic reasoning has re- cently been applied to inflation theory, arriving once again at the conclusion that we should find ourselves within an enormously larger galactic civilization [3]. While the \"We are alone\" solution to Fermi's paradox was once a seem- ingly valid one, this answer is now in- compatible with the infinite universe and random self-sampling assumption consistent with inflation theory. We thus find ourselves in the curi- ous position that current cosmological (See About the Authors on page 5) theory predicts that we should be ex- periencing extraterrestrial visitation. At the same time, current physics and as- trophysics suggest that such visitation may not be as impossible as had been thought. Recent scientific advances In recent astronomical discoveries, over 100 exoplanets have been cata- logued, with detection sensitivity now increased to the point where, in one in- stance, a Jupiter-sized planet was de- duced to be in a Jupiter-like orbit around a Sol-like star [4]. In the field of exobiology, much re- cent activity suggests that some of the building blocks for life may originate in space as well as be transported by meteorites [5-6]. The possibility of widespread panspermia has received new impetus [7-8]. These findings and studies make plausible the hypothesis that there is intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. This is, of course, the fundamental assumption made by the proponents of SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence using microwave or opti- cal means of detection. The extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH), that intelligent life from \"else- where\" in the universe could be visit- ing Earth, has become less implausible through suggestions that the velocity-of-light constraint-\"they can't get here from there\"-is not as restrict- ing as had been assumed previously. This restriction has its origin in the special theory of relativity, which we do not question. However, within the context of general relativity (GR) there are three approaches which may per- mit legitimately bypassing this limit, given sufficiently advanced (perhaps by millions of years!) knowledge of phys- ics and technology. One approach popularized by Thorne and Sagan concerns the possi- bility of wormholes, or cosmic sub- Editor's Note This article appears in the current issue of the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society (BIS), and is used with the their permission. The BIS, founded in 1933, is the world's longest-established organization de- voted solely to supporting and pro- moting the exploration of space and aeronautics. Dr. Bernard Haisch, one of the au- thors of this article, notes: \"This ap- pears to be the first article on the UFO topic published in a main- stream scientific journal since the 1979-1980 articles in Applied Op- tics by Maccabee on the New Zealand sightings.\" ways, a form of shortcut through the space-time metric [9]. Using the standard GR as a basis, certain mathematical requirements for traversable wormholes have been de- rived and published in the scientific lit- erature, and it appears that there is the possibility of engineering a wormhole metric, at least in principle [10]. A second more recent approach pub- lished in the GR literature has been dubbed the \"Alcubierre Warp Drive\" [11-12]. Unlike the speed of light limit through space, there is no limit to the speed at which space itself might stretch. Faster than light (FTL) relative mo- tion is part of inflation theory, and pre- sumably the universe beyond the Hubble distance is receding from us faster thane. It was shown that a spaceship con- tained in a volume of Minkowski space could in principle make use of FTL expansion of space-time behind, and a similar contraction in front, with the in- convenience of time dilation and unto- ward accelerations being overcome. A related approach involves con- JANUARY2005 MUFON UFO JOURNAL"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"structing a \"Krasnikov tube\" [13] to connect spatially remote locales. Of course so-called exotic matter would be required for either case. If GR itself were to be reinterpreted in terms of a polarizable vacuum as first proposed by Dicke [14], this would open the possibility of a different type of metric engineering in which the di- electric properties of the vacuum might be altered in such a way as to raise the local propagation velocity of light. In effect one would be creating a lo- cal index of refraction of less than unity [15]. Finally, there is the conjectured pos- sibility of making use of the additional dimensionalities of M-brane and superstring theory to transfer into ad- jacent universes, where the speed of light limit may be quite different, and reentering our universe at the desired location. This is by far the most specu- lative possibility. Clearly, when it comes to engineer- ing warp drive or wormhole solutions, seemingly insurmountable obstacles emerge, such as unattainable energy requirements [16] or the need for ex- otic matter [17]. Thus, if success is to be achieved, it must rest on some yet unforeseen breakthrough about which we can only speculate, such as a technology to co- here otherwise random vacuum fluc- tuations [18]. Nonetheless, the possibility of reduced-time interstellar travel by ad- vanced extraterrestrial (ET) civiliza- tions is not, as naive consideration might hold, fundamentally ruled out by presently known physical.principles. ET knowledge of the physical uni- verse may comprise new principles which allow some form of FTL travel. This possibility is to be taken seriously, since the average age of suitable stars within the \"galactic habitable zone,\" in which the Earth also resides, is found to be about 10 9 years older than the sun [19] suggesting the possibility of civi- lizations extremely advanced beyond our own. There are further reasons why the \"We are alone\" solution to Fermi's paradox should perhaps be set aside in favor of the ETH. A previously preferred solution, that biogenesis is an exceedingly rare event in conjunction with both panspermia and interstellar travel being inoperative [1], is now scarcely tenable in light of the cosmological considerations already discussed. The ETH appears to be the most viable remaining solution, where \"ET\" is taken in a general non-Earthly sense that could include extra-dimen- sional realms, as in M-brane and superstring theory. Given the highly advanced ET sci- ence and technology to be expected in considerably older civilizations, coupled with the many observational reports since WW n of highly advanced technology seemingly operating at will within Earth's skies, it is only logical to search for evidence of ET visitations in at least a fraction of the ongoing, unex- plainable reports popularly referred to as \"UFO sightings.\" Reluctance to do so could result in our failure to realize that observations of \"genuine\" ET visitations have been occurring. This approach, which we fol- low here, explores the likelihood that we actually do belong to a large civili- zation, but are unaware of that fact. [3]. U.S. Air Force Response (1947-1969) Reports of unknown objects in the skies, appearing as some sort of flying craft and exhibiting extraordinary ma- neuvers, first became known to the gen- eral public in 1947. The first publicized sighting oc- curred on June 24 of that year, after which there were many hundreds of sightings during the following months. The phenomenon has been continuing ever si nee [20-24]. At first the Air Force collected the sighting reports for analysis in its op- eration Project Sign (1948-1949). This was succeeded by Project Grudge (1949-1952) and then Project Blue Book (1952-1969) [20,25]. Some 20% of Project Blue Book's sightings from 1953-1965 were left unexplained, if their \"insufficient data\" category is included [22]. The Battelle Memorial Institute (BMI; Columbus, OH) discovered, in their study of 3,201 reports from 1947 through 1952 that the percentage of unknowns (unexplainable sightings) in- creased with increasing quality of the sighting information and reliability of the observers [21]. A surprisingly high percentage, 30% of the civilian sightings and an even more surprising 38%, of the military sightings rated as excellent in quality, were listed as unknown. On the other hand, only about 16% of the civilian and 20% of the military sightings rated as poor were unknown. The increase in the percentage of un- knowns with increasing quality of the report is an unexpected result if sightings were all explainable as mis- takes (failure to correctly identify the sighted phenomenon) by either the observer(s) or the scientists who ana- lyzed the sightings. In this collection of 3,201 sightings none were listed as hoaxes, and only 1.5% were listed as caused by psycho- logical effects. This result, discovered during the several year long BMI study, refutes the claim made in the Condon Report [22] that UFO reports are from \"less well informed individuals\" who are \"not necessarily reliable.\" It is worthy of note that Condon had access to the results of the BMI study, but there is no reference to it in the Condon Report. Project Blue Book culminated in 1969 with the government sponsored Condon Report [22]. In the opening section of the Report its director con- cluded that, after years of investigation, the U.S. Air Force had found nothing truly new-nothing that supported claims of new physics or the ETH-and that continued investigation probably would not find anything truly new in the future. The Report recommended that the Air Force end its investigation project, which it did in late 1969. The Condon Report (1968) In the late 1960s the U.S. Air Force issued a contract to the University of Colorado to carry out a scientific study of evidence concerning the UFO phe- nomenon. The director of the project was Prof. Edward U. Condon, a distinguished and influential physicist who made no se- cret of his opinion even at the outset that no substantive evidence for extra- terrestrial visitation was liable to result. MUFON UFO JOURNAL JANUARY 2005"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The study was relatively brief (two years) and had a notably low budget (approximately $500,000) for a serious scientific study. When the Condon Report was re- leased in 1968, the American scientific community accepted its apparently negative conclusion concerning evi- dence for extraterrestrial visitation in a generally uncritical way, and to some extent even an enthusiastic way since it offered an end to a troublesome situ- ation. An endorsement of the Report by the National Academy of Sciences took place following an unusually rapid re- view, and the Air Force quickly used the Report as a justification to termi- nate any further public involvement with the topic. The negative conclusion of the Re- port is more apparent than real, how- ever, since there is a substantial discrep- ancy between the conclusion in the \"Summary of the Study\" written by Condon singlehandedly, and the con- clusion one could reasonably draw from the evidence presented in the main body of the Report. Such a dichotomy was possible be- cause the study was a project for which the director, Condon, had sole author- ity; it was not the work of a committee whose members would have to reach some consensus conclusion. An analysis of the Condon Report by Sturrock [26] details the many dis- agreements between Condon's dismiss- ive summary and the actual data. Given the thousand-page length of the Report, one can safely assume that very few in the scientific community would have devoted the time necessary to read the entire document. The impact of the Report was thus largely due to Condon's leveraging his prestigious scientific reputation into an acceptance of his own personal views as representing the apparent outcome of a scientific investigation Indeed, as Sturrock documents, Condon actually took no part in the in- vestigations, and indicated the conclu- sion he intended to draw well before the data were properly examined- hardly a scientific approach. The portion of the Condon Report that contains its sighting analyses does About the Authors Dr. James Deardorff graduated from Stanford University with a B.S. in physics in 1950, then earned a B.A.in meteorology at UCLA in 1951. Following a tour as a Naval officer, he received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Washington in meteorol- ogy. He worked at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, eventually becom- ing a senior scientist. After 16 years there, he went to Oregon State University as a research professor in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences, becoming interested in UFOs in the 1970s. It was about this time that he had the first of what would be five or six UFO sightings. In 1986 he took early retirement and began to devote his time to ufology and New Testament research. His concentration has been on the Billy Meier case, which involves both UFOs and the Talmud of Jmmanuel (TJ), which, if genu- ine, he believes is the source of the gospel of Matthew. From his study of the TJ came his first book, Celestial Teachings: The Emergence of the True Testament of Jmmanuel (Jesus). He later wrote two additional books, Prob- lems of New Testament Gospel Origins, and Jesus in India: A Reexamination of Jesus' Asian Traditions in the Light of Evidence Supporting Reincarnation. He has also written articles on UFOs. Dr. Bernard Haisch was born in Stuttgart, Germany, but is a U.S. citizen. He graduated from Indiana University in 1971 with a BS (high distinction) in astrophys- ics, and the Ph.D. in astronomy from the University of Wisconsin in 1975. He is currently chief science officer at ManyOne Networks. Previous employment includes staff scientist for Lockheed Mar- tin, scientific editor for The Astrophysical Journal, deputy director of the Center for EUV Astrophysics, editor-in-chief of the Journal of Scientific Exploration, visiting scientist at the Astronomical Institute, and research associate at the Join Inst. Lab. Astrophysics at the U. of Colorado. He has written more than 130 papers in various journals, as well as co-authoring two books Solar and Stellar Flares, and The Many Faces of the Sun: A Summary of the Results from NASA's Solar Maximum Mission. Dr. Haisch has served as a member and leader in numerous scientific organizations. Dr. Bruce Maccabee holds the B.S. in physics from Worcester Polytechnic Insti- tute, and the M.S. and Ph.D. in physics from The American University. .He began his long career at the Naval Surface Warfare Center in 1972, and has worked on optical data processing, gen- eration of underwater sound with lasers, and various aspects of the Strategic De- fense Initiative (SDI) and Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD), using high power lasers. He is the author or co-author of about three dozen technical articles, and more than 100 UFO articles. He wrote the last chapter of The Gulf Breeze Sightings, and co-authored with Edward Walters UFOs Are Real, Here's the Proof. His more recent books include The UFO/FBI Connection and a novel, Abduc- tion in My Life. He has been involved with UFO re- search since the 1960s when he joined the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP). He became a member of MUFON in 1975, and has served as MUFON State Director for Maryland for many years, as well as a MUFON photo consultant and Symposium speaker. In 1979 he was instrumental in estab- lishing the Fund for UFO Research, and served as chairman for 13 years. He cur- rently serves on the board of the Fund. He has investigated a number of high- profile UFO cases in detail, including the McMinnville photos. Gulf Breeze photos, the 1997 Mexico City video, and the 2004 Mexican Air Force images.

Many of the events presented within its Case Studies section do fall into the \"unidentified\" category of UFOs, for which the Report's definition was, in essence: \"A puzzling stimulus for a report of something seen in the sky or landed on the earth that could not be identified as having an ordinary natu- ral origin.\" In a detailed review of this Report, however, it was noted that \"The sheer bulk of the report, much of it 'scien- tific padding,' cannot conceal from any- one who studies it closely that it exam- ines only a tiny fraction of the really puzzling UFO reports, and that its sci- entific argumentation is often unsatis- factory. Of roughly ninety cases that it specifically confronts, more than thirty are conceded to be unexplained.\" [27] Four of the cases, reanalyzed and re- ported in detail at the 1969 A A AS Symposium, disclosed how unscientific the Condon Report's treatment of them had been; the reanalyses have since gone unrefuted. Hence we cannot agree with the Condon Report's assertion that the phe- nomenon provides no new subjects for science to explore, given that many sightings were left unexplained. Furthermore, in many of the cases that the Report claimed to have identi- fied, that goal was achieved merely through assuming that the witnesses had seen something differing in detail from what they had reported. Also, a committee of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronau- tics in 1971 found \"it difficult to ignore the small residue of well-documented but unexplainable cases that form the hard core of the UFO controversy\" [2B]. Clearly, the Condon Report was left in an unsatisfactory state. [20,24-26,29-30] The primary conclusion of the Condon panel sidestepped the main is- sue, the failure to explain every sight- ing, by saying, \"The evidence presented on Unidentified Flying Objects shows no indication that these phenomena con- stitute a direct physical threat to national security. [22] This is not inconsistent, however, with some fraction of unexplained re- ports representing actual ET visitations. (To be continued in the February Journal.) References 1 .S.

Large triangular object reported in India Hard on the heels of the mysterious MiG-21 crash in the desert west of Bikaner came two sightings of a very large triangular UFO in India. One of these, on Nov. 5, 2004, in- volved the Bhadha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) in Trombay, a suburb of Mumbai, India's largest city, where workers saw a bright light beyond the windows of the plant's Cirrus 40-mega- watt heavy water reactor building. When they went outdoors, into the parking lot, they saw \"a large triangu- lar UFO hovering silently\" overhead. The object then flew slowly over the plant grounds and hovered above the building containing BARC's Dhruva 100-megawatt heavy water reactor. The object remained in view for several minutes, making no noise, before it retreated in a northwesterly direction. \"We think it may have been heading back to the Himalayas,\" Krishnari Bai Dharapurnanda, UFO Roundup corre- spondent in India, reported. The BARC plant was built in 1957 by Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and named in honor of Hbmi Bhadha, India's leading nuclear scien- tist. -Thanks to UFO Roundup, Vol. 9, No. 47.

Keyhoe From the NICAP records It was early in 1959 when I learned of this hidden report-a startling encoun- ter with a UFO. The lead came in a brief message from Adm. Delmar S. Fahrney, former Navy missile chief, whom I had known for years. \"Capt. James Taylor, USN, Ret., has an im- portant UFO sighting made by a naval pilot and his crew. Call him at Spacetronics, Inc., in Washington, Dis- trict 7-9481.\" That night, when Capt. Taylor gave me this dramatic Navy report, I could see why it had never been released to the public. Later, Adm. Fahrney and I met at the Army-Navy Club and dis- cussed the details. Fahrney knew, as well as I did, of other hidden UFO cases-some of them highly significant. But this one stood out in importance. It had happened in 1956. Cruising at 19,000 feet, a Navy R7V-2 transport- a four-engine Super-Constellation-was flying west across the Atlantic Ocean. The next stop was Gander, Newfound- land. Final destination, Naval Air Sta- tion, Patuxent, MD. The night was clear, visibility unlim- ited. In the senior pilot's seat, Com- mander George Benton was checking the dimly-lit instruments. At 34, Benton had a decade of Navy flying behind him. He had made the Atlantic cross- ing more than two hundred times. Back in the cabin were two extra Navy air crews, enroute home from foreign duty. Most of these men were asleep. Including Benton's regular and relief crews, there were nearly 30 air- men-pilots, navigators and flight engi- neers aboard the Constellation. As Cmdr. Benton finished his cock- pit check, he glanced out at the stars. Then he leaned forward, puzzled. A few minutes before, the sea below had been dark. Now there was a cluster of lights, like a village, about 25 miles ahead. Benton looked over at his co-pilot, Lt. Peter J. Mooney. \"What do you make of those lights?\" Mooney peered down, startled. \"Looks like a small town!\" \"That's what I thought.\" Benton quickly called the navigator, Lt. Alfred C. Erdman. \"We must be way off course. There's land down there.\" \"It can't be land.\" Erdman hurried forward from his map table. \"That last star sight showsâ€”\" He broke off, star- ing down at the clustered lights. \"Well?\" said Benton. 'They must be ships,\" said Erdman. \"Maybe a rendezvous for some special operation.\" \"They don't look like ships,\" said Benton. He called radioman John Wiggins. No word of any unusual ship movements, Wiggins reported. And no signals from the location of the lights. If they were ships, they were keeping radio silence. \"Wake up those other crews,\" Benton told Erdman. \"Maybe some- body can dope it out.\" In a few mo- ments, two or three airmen crowded into the cockpit. Benton cut off the au- tomatic pilot, and banked to give them and the men in the cabin a better view. As the transport began to circle, the strange lights abruptly dimmed. Then several colored rings appeared and be- gan to spread out. One, Benton noticed, seemed to be growing in size. Behind him, someone gave an exclamation. Benton took another look. That lu- minous ring wasn't on the surface-it was something rushing up toward the transport. \"What the devil is it?\" said Mooney. \"Don't know,\" muttered Benton. He rolled the Constellation out of its turn to start a full-power climb. Then he saw it was useless. The luminous ring could catch them in seconds. The glow, he now saw, came from the rim of some large, round object. It reached their altitude, swiftly took shape as a giant disc-shaped machine. Dwarfing the Constellation, it raced in toward them. \"It's going to hit us!\" said Erdman. Benton had known nor- mal fear, but this was a nightmare: Numbed, he waited for the crash. Suddenly the giant disc tilted. Its speed sharply reduced, it angled on past the port wing. The commander let out his breath. He looked at Mooney's white face, and saw the others' stunned expres- sions. Watching out the port window, he cautiously started to bank. He stopped as he saw the disc. It had swung around and was drawing abreast, pacing them at about one hun- dred yards. For a moment he had a clear glimpse of the monster. Its sheer bulk was amaz- ing; its diameter was three to four times the Constellation's wing span. At least thirty feet thick at the cen- ter, it was like a gigantic dish inverted on top of another. Seen at this distance, the glow along the rim was blurred and uneven. Whether it was an electrical effect; a series of jet exhausts or lights from opening in the rim, Benton could not tell. But the glow was bright enough to show the disc's curving surface, giving a hint of dully reflecting metal. Though Benton saw no signs of life, he had a feeling they were being ob- served. Fighting an impulse to dive away, he held to a straight course. Gradually, the strange machine pulled ahead. Tilting its massive shape upward, it quickly accelerated and was lost against the stars. Commander Benton reached for his microphone, called Gander Air- port and identified himself. \"You show any other traffic out here?\" he asked the tower. \"We had something on the scope near you,\" Gander told him. \"But we couldn't get an answer.\" \"We saw it,\" Benton said grimly. \"It was no aircraft.\" He gave the tower a concise report, and back at Gander teletype messages were rushed to the U.S. Air Defense Com- mand, the Commanding Officer, East- em Sea Frontier, the Director of Air Force Intelligence, and the Air Techni- cal Intelligence Center. When the Constellation landed at Gander, Air Force intelligence officers met the transport. From the start, it was plain they accepted the giant disc sight- ing as fact. For two hours, Benton and the rest were carefully interrogated [de- briefed], separately and together. From the answers to scores of ques- JANUARY 2005 MUFON UFO JOURNAL"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"tions, the majority opinion emerged. The flying disc was between 350 and 400 feet in diameter, and apparently metallic. No interference with ignition noted, instruments not observed, and radio not operating during this brief period. Time for the giant disc to climb to the transport's altitude, between five and eight seconds; indicated speed be- tween 1,400 and 2,200 knots; the disc had accelerated above this speed on de- parture. If the other circles below were also flying discs, in a rendezvous as some suggested, they apparently had.raced off while the other one was checking on the Constellation. At one point, an Intelligence captain asked Benton if he had seen any indi- cation.of life aboard the disc. \"No, but it was intelligently controlled, that's cer- tain. That size, it would hardly be re- mote-controlled, would it?\" \"I couldn't say,\" replied the Air Force man. Nor would he tell what the Gander Airport radar had shown about the disc's speed and maneuvers. \"What's behind all this?\" demanded Mooney. \"Up to now, I believed the Air Force. You people say there aren't any flying saucerâ€”\" \"Sorry, I can't answer any ques- tions,\" said the captain. After the Constellation reached Patuxent, the air crews were inter- viewed [debriefed] again by Navy or- der. Each man made a written report, with his opinion of what he had seen. Five days later, Cmdr. Benton had a phone call from a scientist in a high government agency. \"I'm informed you had a close-up UFO sighting, I'd like to see you.\" Benton checked, and found the man was cleared by the Navy. Next day, the scientist appeared, showed his creden- tial, and listened intently to Benton's re- port. Then he unlocked a dispatch case and took out some photographs. \"Was it like any of these?\" At the third picture, Benton stopped him. \"That's it!\" He looked sharply at the scientist. \"Somebody must know the answers, if you've got photographs of the things.\" The other man took the pictures. \"I'm sorry, Commander.\" He closed his dispatch case and left. Dear Dwight, Re. Bev Trout's recent article, \"Ser- pents of Wisdom? Or Snakes in the Grass....\" which appeared in MUFON UFO Journal issue #437, September 2004, I would be most interested in having her reference her claim about \"other records [pointing] to Adam and Eve...having unusual skin.\" (On p. 12, that issue.) . I have discussed at length with two other UFO research investigators, who are Jewish, Trout's claim that the Haggadah describes Adam and Eve's \"reptilian skin\" shedding off when they ate forbidden fruit off the Tree of Knowledge in the Garden of Eden. These very experienced investigators state most definitely that the Haggadah text describes the exit of the Israelites from Egypt, and NOT anything about Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden. Since this .same claim re. the Haggadah describing Adam and Eve's \"reptilian skin\" appeared very recently in another article in a research journal (I don't know whether it was the MUFON UFO Journal or not) I feel an obligation to question this being put forth repeatedly in UFO literature with- out references. I would appreciate your contacting Bev Trout about this and asking her to inform us precisely what page of what edition of the Haggadah describes her claim, so that readers can look up, for themselves, whether or not Adam and Eve's (original) skin was \"reptilian\" in nature. Ann Druffel Following is Bev Trout's response: Hello, Ann, I have not researched the Haggadah myself, instead relying on quotes from a book by R. A. Boulay entitled: Fly- ing Serpents and Dragons with a sub- title, The Story of Mankind's Reptilian Past, in which Boulay quotes the Haggadah on many pages of his book. Specifically in Boulay's book, the quote attributed to the Haggadah re the \"horny skin\" appears on Page 122 (al- though there are many references and quotes from the Haggadah in Boulay's book, as can be ascertained from the Index). In the Bibliography on Page 267 of Boulay's book is the following: [Leg- ends of the Bible by Louis Ginzberg. The Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956. This is an abridged edition of Legends of the Jews, origi- nally published in seven volumes in 1909. \"The Legends\" is a vast store of Jew- ish stories and lore forming the oral tra- dition of the Bible known as the Haggadah.\" Boulay also refers to a Christian Gnostic tract dating to the First Cen- tury AD quoting the following: \"Now Eve believed the words of the serpent. She looked at the tree. She took some of its fruit and ate, and she gave to her husband also, and he ate too. Then their mind opened. For when they ate, the light of knowledge shone for them; they knew that they were naked with regard to knowledge. When they saw their makers, they loathed them since they were \"beastly forms.\" They understood very much.\" Boulay's take, then is that since Adam and Eve (first man) were cre- ated in \"the image of god\" that our an- cient gods were not human mammals like us, but an alien reptilian form. Whatever the total truth of who or what interfered in our evolution, it does appear that the serpent (in whatever form) has been a very big player in mankind's past-and encounter reports, including my own, would seem to sub- stantiate some sort of role on a repro- ductive level continuing on into mod- ern times. Not necessarily a comforting assess- ment, but seeming to demand a close look at the phenomenon (as best we can) for what it is, rather than what we want it to be Hope this helps.

Distant, cold object discovered in elliptical orbit of Sun When astronomers .from Caltech, Gemini Observatory, and Yale Univer- sity announced the discovery of the cold- est, most distant object known to orbit the Sun, some observers concluded that this \"planet\" in an elliptical orbit might be the elusive Planet X. The object was found at a distance 90 times greater than that from the Sun to the Earth-about three times further than Pluto, the most distant known \"planet.\" Even more interesting, the orbit of Sedna is extreme elliptical, in contrast to all of the much closer planets, and it takes 10,500 years to circle the Sun. The discovery was made on the Samuel Oschin Telescope at the Palomar Observatory east of San Diego. Because of its frigid temperatures, the object has been named Sedna, after the Inuit goddess of the sea from whom all sea creatures were created. Sedna is the most distant solar sys- tem object ever discovered. It is twice as far from the Sun as any other solar system object, and three times farther than Pluto or Neptune. Discovery images of Sedna show only a point of light, so scientists cannot . Elliptical path of Sedna.

Photos from Turkey appear to show genuine UFO Two amateur mountaineers, Cem Arat and Mehmet Safak. both 20 years of age at the time, took a series of pho- tos in 1996 which still await detailed analysis by MUFON, but which have been declared authentic in two tests con- ducted in Turkey. The photos were taken on Feb. 19, 1996, at Yamanlar Mountain Park, Karagol, near Izmir, Turkey. The two explained that they had taken a camera with them to shoot \"memory\" photos of each other, as they anticipated being called into the Army. The UFO reportedly appeared sud- denly, they told UFO investigator Michael Hesemann when he interviewed them in 2001. They said the object startled them, and \"was definitely nothing built on Earth.\" They said the object could hoyer on the spot, increase to tremendous speed, shoot up and down, and rotate around its axis-all very fast and completely soundless. The sighting lasted about two minutes before the object disappeared \"in the blink on an eye.\" The sighting was investigated by the Sirius UFO Space Sciences Research Center in Istanbul. Founder and chair- man Haktan Akdogan reports that the photos were analyzed by Dr. Ahmet Imancer of Egean University, who could find no evidence of a hoax. The photos were also analyzed by ON Kodak Photo Labs in Istanbul by Ahmet Bayramusta, who reported in June 2002 that the 35mm negative film image \"is original, and the photo developed out of this film is not manipulated. Also, the negative and the photo have not been manipulated in a computer environment.\" Efforts by the Journal to obtain the negatives for analysis by MUFON have been unsuccessful. Mr. Akdogan reports that he contacted the two witnesses on behalf of MUFON, and that they \"can- not send the negatives overseas.\" -Thanks to Esen Sekerkarar, MUFON representative for Turkey.

I also noticed that other people, about 15 other drivers, had done the same, and were now outside their vehicles looking up at what I just couldn't believe. \"At about 3,000 feet was the largest flying object that I have ever seen- something like, say, the new Airbus A380, not yet in service, or a Boeing 747, would have been dwarfed by it. - ' \"The crazy thing was-absolute si- lence !

This object was too big and too silent to be a 737.1 then asked if they had anything on radar. 'Nothing,' they said.\" Mark then called the Cardiff RAF base. He reports, \"Again, 'nothing.' This thing was almost the size of a very large container ship. It didn't have any visible wings or any other way of showing how it could stay in the air. \"If I saw it on the ground, I would bet money that it was not able to fly. The DRAWN & QUARTERED weather was good with ten miles visibil- ity.

He was almost speechless when I started to describe the same thing that he had seen moments after me. \"He had been out with a girlfriend, on Oct. 14 and was driving home when she spotted the object from her passenger seat. They both got out of the car, along with the other road users who had stopped their cars. \"This was almost a reconstruction of what had happened five minutes earlier, with me, only it was happening now to the northeast of Cardiff city. \"His account is identical to mine in the size of the object, the height of the object, and its speed.

She describes it as a creature with a human form that was covered with dark hair or fur, with whitish rings around its eyes. Ward says the mysterious ani- mal stood erect in a drainage ditch along the road, and she estimates its height at 8 feet. Based on her description, it might have been foraging in the ditch when she surprised it, as she says it looked like it was doing something. \"It was focused on something,\" Ward says. \"Whenever it saw me, it probably took on the facial expression I had on, be- cause I was dumbfounded. It just watched me as I drove by.\" Asked if it might have been a bear, she replied, \"No chance at all.\" Ward says she didn't stop because her two daughters were sleeping in the back seat, and she feared the animal might attack her Toyota 4-Runner if given the chance. She went back to the scene later to search for hair or footprints, but she didn't find any conclusive evidence. 10 MUFON UFO JOURNAL JANUARY 2005"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":".

Reviewed by Dwight Connelly This book reveals details about the Flatwoods, Braxton County, West Vir- ginia, \"monster\" which should have been fully documented years ago by ufologists-but hasn't been. Although ufologist Gray Barker was on the scene soon after the 1952 event, interviewed some witnesses, and wrote about it in the first issue ofSaucerian, the investigation was superficial. Also on the scene early was natural- ist and anomaly investigator Ivan T. Sanderson, who provided a reasonably accurate, but quite incomplete, descrip- tion of the encounter. Both Barker and Sanderson missed at least four key witnesses. Local journalist A Lee Stewart, Jr. covered much of the sighting soon af- ter the encounter, recording and quot- ing witnesses in a straightforward man- ner, but, publicly at least, did not cover several important details. Respected ufologist Stanton Fried- man, who wrote the Foreward and Epi- logue of this book, has long defended this encounter as worthy of serious con- sideration, but even he did not find time to do the detailed research necessary to make this an impressive case. But author Feschino, who spent more than ten years researching the key encounter and what he believes are re- lated events, has finally pulled enough evidence together to make this a solid case-and he completed his research just in time, as one of the key witnesses, National Guard Capt. Dale Leavitt, has since died. This book has already received quite a bit of publicity in the media, due in part to Feschino's public appearances in promoting it. Unfortunately, many of the recent media reports have fo- cused-and negatively commented-on the least documented and most contro- versial part of this book-alleged en- counters between military aircraft and UFOs. What could have been simply a badly-needed re- investigation and report on the Flatwoods en- counter has thus been weakened by the author's unsub- stantiated speculation that the Braxton County object had been damaged dur- ing an encounter with military aircraft. While the object which landed at Flatwoods may have been damaged, as suggested by oil and metal pieces at the site, there is no evidence that this dam- age resulted from an encounter with a military aircraft. Feschino seems to have come up with this theory after discovering sev- eral reports of fiery objects moving in trajectories that suggest they originated just off the east coast, where he specu- lates an air battle ensued. These objects were not meteors, as no meteors were recorded on that date, but Feschino's conclusion that these fi- ery objects were showing damage from an encounter with military planes is also not warrarited-and speculation that there were rescue UFOs, plus other UFOs guarding the rescue activities, is just that, speculation. The author does not document any missing military planes off the east coast, nor any reports of encounters with UFOs, but he does spend several pages trying to turn an explainable missing plane incident over the Gulf of Mexico into an unexplainable encoun- ter with a UFO, despite the lack of any real evidence. Feschino describes as fact a blow by blow encounter between Air Force jets and UFOs, as. well as a background ac- counting of what President Truman was allegedly doing-all without evidence being presented. It should be noted that the author's extensive search of newspaper files and Blue Book did result in locating an im- pressive number of meteor-like fiery objects-as well as at least one report of an object described as a \"flying sau- cer\"-around the time of the Flatwoods encounter, and over a wide area of the eastern U.S., but not over the Gulf of Mexico. Unfortunately, there is another prob- lem in making this case as impressive as it should be with the general public, and that is the continuing description of the object encountered by witnesses as a \"monster,\" even after Feschino has presented impressive evidence that it was a mechanical device. While \"monster\" was apparently the terminology used by at least some of the frightened witnesses and the media back in 1952-and probably by those in the Flatwoods area even today-there is now no reason to keep using that de- scription-at least without quotation marks. Unfortunately, \"monster\" is used not only in the title of the book (without quotation marks), but also by the au- thor throughout the book. It is even the title of his website. Perhaps he feels that the terminology has become so in- grained that it would confuse matters to simply use \"Flatwoods encounter.\" But adding to the early sensational- izing of the encounter was the widely publicized drawing of the \"monster\" by a TV artist, complete with arms, claws, and other monster-like characteristics which were not described by witnesses. Fortunately, the author is an excel- JANUARY2005 MUFON UFO JOURNAL 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"lent illustrator, and he presents a very realistic and accurate rendition of the object on the cover of the book. In spite of the shortcomings noted, Feschino has now provided enough impressive information that this case should take its rightful place among le- gitimate encounters. The main incident began for the Flatwoods witnesses as a bright object (the author suggests there may have been more than one) was seen moving across the countryside around dusk on Sept. 12,1952, and apparently landing on a small mountain or hill just outside the little town of Flatwoods. Among the witnesses uncovered by Feschino was Jack Davis, described as a prominent businessman in the area, who says he saw a lighted object the size of a garage, not traveling at an ex- cessive speed and apparently con- trolled, silently move just above the trees, slow down, and apparently land. He says the object \"had a clearer, brighter illuminated light from the top, and kind of an orange-red. The top of it had the reflection of a light that I would describe today as a mercury va- por light. It did not resemble a meteor to me. To me, the object that I saw was a craft.\" A report was also made to the sheriff's office by Woodrow Eagle of Duck Creek, who was traveling to- wards Flatwoods when he saw what he thought was an.airplane on fire crash- ing into the mountains. What were to be some of the key wit- nesses, however, were 10 boys playing football in Flatwoods who saw a fiery object move over their heads and ap- parently land on the mountain top. Most of the boys took off in the di- rection of the landing site, creating enough noise to cause people to come out of their houses to see what was hap- pening. When they came to the Lemon house, they rushed in to report what they had seen to Mrs. Kathleen May, the mother of one of the boys. She decided to accompany some of the boys up to the landing site, as did young Eugene Lemon, who took his dog along, and six-year-old Tommy Hyer. It was now about 7:40 PM, and darkness was closing in. Mrs. May grabbed a flashlight, as did Lemon. Led by Lemon, the group made their way up the mountain to the Fisher farm. Eventually they found themselves on a path with a fence line and a pear or- chard to their right. Some of the older, taller members of the group said that at that point they could look off into a valley and see a fiery spherically- shaped object about the size of a barn sitting and pulsating. Other members of the group, such as little Tommy Hyer, were apparently too short to see beyond the vegetation and into the valley. The author does not say whether Mrs. May saw the ob- ject in the valley, and it seems strange that the entire group was seemingly not alerted to this significant observation, since this was apparently the main ob- ject they were looking for. As the group moved a little farther up the mountain they became aware of a fog-like mist, along with a pungent, nauseating odor that affected their noses and throats. Mrs. May describes the odor as \"kinda metallic,\" saying, \"It affected me in the throat and chest area.\" Freddie May said the group also heard a noise like an electrical compressor being shut down. Suddenly Lemon's dog began to growl, then ran ahead of the group, 12 MUFON UFO JOURNAL JANUARY 2005"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Sketch of tbc ttatwooda Momurr by Hunt Fortdno.

Moments later it ran back down the mountain and raced past the group. It was later reported that the dog had gone all the way back to the village, vomited all over the veranda, and subsequently died, according to researcher Sanderson. With Mrs. May now leading the way, the group came up to a large oak tree near the path, where they heard what sounded like bacon being fried, com- bined with the sound of \"flipping a sil- ver dollar or something against a piece of canvas.\" Seeing what they at first thought was an animal with bright eyes up in the tree, they directed their flashlights on it and were horrified to see what appeared to be a towering figure, about 12 feet high. The dully glowing \"eyes\" of the object lit up brilliantly, then projected an ee- rie orange light outward, cutting JANUARY 2005 through the fog and illuminating the area. The object seemed to be dark-col- ored, but also appeared to be heating up and beginning to glow. It then rose a bit from the ground and glided toward the path and the group. Lemon dropped his flashlight and fell to the ground, but quickly got back up. As the object moved past the group, Mrs. May was closest to it. As it made hissing and frying noises, it sprayed oil on Mrs. May's nurse's uniform, but not on her skin. She says the top of the monster be- hind the lighted \"eyes\" was like the ace of spades, the middle body was round and smooth, like metal, and the bottom part flared out like a series of tubes, which she believes provided the pro- pulsion that allowed the object to glide along the ground. Between the upper part and the middle part was \"something like anten- nae sticking out from it,\" says Mrs. MUFON UFO JOURNAL May. An artist for a TV show depicted these antennae-like devices as arms with claw-like hands. The tubes were depicted on TV as a flowing skirt, and the smooth middle section was made to look like the upper body of a witch- like creature, creating the \"monster.\" Everyone began running back down the hill, not stopping until they reached the Lemon home, and some not even stopping there. Mrs. May, a nurse, tried to tend to the traumatized youngsters. Some had cuts and scrapes from the run back home, while others were coughing and vomiting, including Eu- gene Lemon, who reportedly vomited off and on all night. Mrs. May called the sheriff's office, but was told that all the law enforce- ment people were out looking for a reported plane crash. The sheriff's of- fice contacted state trooper Ted Tribett, who also could not go to Mrs. May's home, but he did send a journalist who worked closely with the police, A. Lee 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Stewart, Jr., from the Braxton Demo- crat, who did go to Mrs. May's home to interview the witnesses. Stewart was one of the key witnesses that Feschino was able to track down , even though the journalist had left the Braxton area six years after the inci- dent and moved to North Carolina. Stewart confirmed to the author that \"it was sheer turmoil\" at Mrs. May's house. \"Three boys were very sick,\" he recalls, \"and all of them were wheez- ing and coughing. Mrs. May's eyes were as red as they could be, and sort of weepy.\" Stewart convinced two of the older boys to accompany him back up the mountain to the area where the object was seen. Three or four other individu- als, including Mrs. May's father, also went. All carried firearms. Near the site, Stewart discovered that some of the odor described by the witnesses still lingered near the ground. The group made a sweep of the area, and located \"skid marks,\" which were two paths running roughly parallel, each about 30 feet long, ten or eleven feet apart, and 24 to 30 inches wide. They led from the valley up to the area where the frightening object had been seen. Feschino also tracked down another key individual involved in the incident, Col. Dale Leavitt, who was a former paratrooper and commander in the West Virginia National Guard. Initially reluctant to talk, Col. Leavitt, who had been a captain at the time of the incident, eventually accompanied the author to the sighting area. He said that National Guard mem- bers from throughout the area had been alerted that night, and that he had been asked by the Air Force to assist in lo- cating a reported downed aircraft. He and about 30 troops had arrived in the Flatwoods area at about 1:30 AM. They were later joined by about 20 to 30 additional troops. He said he had remained at the actual location of the landing for about 45 minutes, but that the troops stayed in the area the rest of the night \"to see if something else was going to happen.\" He said he had two specific missions to accomplish: (1) to prevent unautho- rized entry into the area, and (2) to gather samples of leaves and dirt and uwW ty A.U* Sketch of pieces of metal found. any other material he could locate. He said he sent what he gathered to the Air Force, but never heard any results. Col. Leavitt says the leaves he sampled had not been burned, \"but I got some of this oil.\" He apparently also found at least one piece of metal. In describing what appears to have been the landing site, he says, \"I saw all this stuff pushed over and every- thing, and it landed right here. Well, it landed gently because it didn't go down in the dirt or anything like that.\" He said the landing area covered about 20 feet, and it was not burned. Col. Leavitt had also discovered the skid marks or tracks, saying, \"The tracks just stopped here, and that's all there was to it, and it got out just the same way.\" Leavitt acknowledged that there was oil in the area where the ob- ject had sat down. He also mentioned another incident reported that evening involving a UFO shutting down the engine of an auto in the Duck Creek area. Levitt concluded, \"Something was a cover-up. There was something down below, too, but I don't really know what it was.\" Asked by Feschino if he thought it was an experimental craft or if it came from someplace else,\" Col. Leavitt re- plied, \"No, I think it came from some- place else, personally.\" At about 7 AM on the day after the sighting, Stewart was back at the scene, the first to view it in daylight. Like Col. Leavitt, he also noticed the apparent landing area with the grass pushed down; \"round and I'd say about 20 feet across.\" Stewart walked the \"skid marks,\" and, says Feschino, noted that even though there was apparently no ground contact made in creating these tracks, some outside force had turned over some rocks. Feschino suggests that the evidence indicates that the main object had initially landed on top of the mountain, then took off and landed a second time in the val- ley.  .. - - The \"tracks\" or \"skid marks\" were apparently made by the frightening ob- ject encountered on the mountain as it came and went from the larger, barn- sized object in the valley. While checking out the skid marks, Stewart realized he was getting oil on his clothes, as he had the night before. But he also found something else as he walked the skid marks: a piece of metal. \"It looked like somebody had taken a soldering iron and just dripped solder,\" he explains. \"The piece'of metal was shiny and silver, very easy to see in the daylight.. .ragged on the edges like any dripped metal would be.\" Stewart says he later tried to melt the metal with a soldering torch, \"and I couldn't melt it.\" He says he took it to a welding shop, and they couldn't melt it either. Three people who said they worked for the Treasury Department, but who claimed they were not representing the government, came to his home to inquire about the metal and the oil that Stewart had on his clothing. Using tin snips, he cut off a piece of the metal for them, and placed the rest in a vial. He also allowed them to scrape the oil off his clothing. The next day, while he was at the newspaper, the rest of the metal disappeared. Mrs. May was also visited by two in- dividuals claiming to be journalists-a claim she later felt was false-and they took oil samples from her uniform. She kept the uniform for awhile, then appar- ently discarded it as unwearable. Feschino covers much, much more in this book, including other sightings in the area, numerous illustrations, and addi- tional details suggesting not only interest in the case by the government, but also evidence of a government cover-up. There is so much material-and it so scattered-that the lack of an index is re- grettable. This book is well worth reading and purchasing. Feschino has done an ex- cellent job in locating key witnesses missed by other researchers, and in giv- ing credence to this historic case. 14 MUFON UFO JOURNAL JANUARY 2005"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Director, MUFON Eastern Region Note: These reports are presented in or- der to keep readers informed of some of the vast number of sightings being reported.

Marshall Chadwell CIA Direc- tor of Scientific Intelligence, 1952: \"All this time, the reports of incidents convince us that there is something go- ing on that must have immediate attention....Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in the vicinity of major US defense installations are of such na- ture that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or known types of vehicles.\" Scientists fear Mars attack Scientists have warned we may soon be under attack from planet Mars. They are concerned that the Earth's defenses are too weak and unprepared to with- stand a determined alien invasion from the Red Planet. Sounds like science fiction? Well, it's a fact-space probes exploring Mars may contaminate Earth with deadly dis- eases on their return. Experts say humans could be at risk for infections for which there are no known cures, and which could wipe out life on our planet. The warning comes after scientists studied data from the probe Opportunity, which landed on Mars in January. Jeffrey Kargel, of the US Geologi- cal Survey, told The Sun: \"Before pro- ceeding with sample returns or human missions to Mars, we must review measures for planetary biological pro- tection.\" Dr Kargel said it seemed in- creasingly likely that life had existed there. A possible abduction? BOCA RATON-The witness went George Filer to bed with his wife about 1:15 AM while watching TV on Nov. 20, 2004. He remembers turning off the TV, and quickly falling into a deep sleep. He states, \"In what seemed an in- stant I was awakened by my wife, who asked, 'Where were you?' My imme- diate response was 'in our bed.' \"My wife then explained to me that she awoke and I was not in bed with her, so she searched the whole house and even walked to the guard house of our commu- nity to see if the guard had seen me. Nobody had come into or gone out of the commu- nity. \"Upon her return, she burst into the room and found me in our bed. She stated that my car was in our driveway, and that my wallet, cell phone, and money was just as I had left it, which further upset her. The covers in our bed on my side looked exactly as if I had pushed them down and left. \"I glanced at the clock, and it was about 2:30 AM when she stormed into our bedroom and awoke me. I tried to comfort her, and confirmed that I had not left our bed, not even to use the bathroom. \"In the morning, I asked her to con- firm what had happened during the night, and she confirmed I had been missing. I am willing to have this event investigated. I am not sure what really happened, but the evidence suggests I was somehow physically missing from my home for 45-60 minutes without my knowledge. \"I was told to examine myself for any marks, and did not find any.

Lights play in the UK LONDON-The observer was out jogging when he saw three lights going back and forth constantly and at a very quick rate above the scattered clouds on Nov. 21, 2004, at 10:14 PM. The lights reportedly flew \"a mile per sec- ond or more and stopped instantly.\" The witness says, \"They would go back, split into three, merge, and play with each other. \"A police car with flashing lights tried to go through some red traffic lights, and the lights in the sky noticed and came directly above the police car and stopped, and flashed as quickly as the police cars lights. \"They seemed to mock the police car lights until they drove off.

New Jersey circle formation MENDHAM-On Nov. 18, 2004, a lawyer stopped to get the mail at 6 PM, and noticed four separate round lights in sort of a circle formation flying well below an airplane. They moved counterclockwise in- credibly fast, then moved in toward each other, and then away. The witness says, \"I then noticed an- other set of lights over my neighbor's house, and drove down my road two- tenths of a mile and noticed the left set of lights following right above my car, causing me to panic. \"I turned around and sped back to the top of the driveway and tried to dial the police on my cell phone, but I was not able to get it to work.

Indiana flying triangle BLOOMINGTON-Lynn Taylor re- ports, \"At 7:10 PM, the witness was southbound on Walnut Street on Nov. 13,2004, approaching the intersection of State Highway 45, when she ob- served a large triangle-shaped object traveling southeast, toward the busy intersection ahead. \"As the object approached, the wit- ness could see two red lights, one on the tip of each trailing edge. \"She also described the center of the craft as having an amber-colored light or lights that constantly changed shape. \"As the object crossed the intersec- tion, the witness momentarily looked away to check the traffic conditions. When she looked up again to observe the craft, only a single red light was vis- ible. \"She was insistent that the object was triangle-shaped, and was not an ad- vertising blimp. \"The witness indicated her confi- dence in the object's shape because its lighting partially illuminated the under- side. She further offered that the object was much too fast and low to be a blimp anyway. \"From her conversation and descrip- tion of the sighting and my familiarity with the area, I would estimate the ob- ject was flying approximately 120 feet above the ground.\" Thanks to Lynn Taylor Sentinel Files.

The wit- ness states, \"My friend arid I saw three mysterious looking objects gliding lit- erally right above Waikiki Beach. It looked as if they were creating an arc, flying a mile away from the beach and gliding back and forth. \"The objects then gradually gained altitude as they were still moving back and forth: Eventually, those three ob- jects got high enough to hide behind the clouds. These were not commercial air- craft, but funny oval-shaped orange lights.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Tennessee triangle KINGSPORT-On Dec. 9, 2004, at 9 PM, three witnesses described a very large triangular craft passing over, slowly illuminated by the city lights against clouds. It was nearly black, with four blue lights arranged in a diamond shape and a large single appendage on the bottom which was glowing reddish- orange. It was circled by many smaller red, blue, and green strobing lights. The back of the craft had a long appendage which produced an eerie bluish light. The witness' wife noted several odd markings on the bottom, and the craft made a slight humming sound. Several small, fast, red and blue il- luminated ball-like objects playfully flew around the sky in all directions. The craft was the size of a large televi- sion set at arm's length. We can assume the object was quite low and large. Another Tennessee triangle BRISTOL-The witness reported that on Dec. 9, 2004, at 9:10 PM, he was carrying his camera when he saw a strange triangular shape moving across the sky. He used his digital cam- era to take a series of photographs. The object was quite large and moved behind a nearby mountain to the west, which is the area of a sighting reported earlier that night in Kingsport. This photo (above) has not been en- hanced and the witness stated that the bright spot between the three smaller lights was not visible when he took the photographs. Thanks to Kim Shaffer, MUFON TN SD. Iowa flying triangle OTTUMWA-The witness reports seeing a triangular object with red and blue lights. The lights were turning in a clockwise manner while the object was moving from northwest to southeast on Nov. 29, 2004, at 11:47 PM. It was about as far up as a small air- craft would travel. As it passed over, it seemed to be standing still. The witness states, \"I was standing next to a fire, and it seemed to be watch- ing what was going on. It had no blink- ing lights at all. It had no tail, no wings. After a few seconds it continued on to the southeast and did not make a sound. It seemed to be quietly gliding on the air. The craft stopped right over my head as I had to tilt my head all the way back to see it. It was NOT an airplane.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Pennsylvania orb sighting MCKEESPORT-The witness was outside his house when he saw a bright light in the sky. He states, \"I called my Bristol, TN, .photo shows familiar triangle shape. wife out to see, and we watched for twenty minutes around 1PM on Nov. 28,2004.

Global News, reported on Dec. 9.2004. that two women driv- ing in a car on the Island Highway at 8:30 PM, between Port Alberni and Tofino narrowly missed hitting a large Sasquatch that had stepped on to the roadway in front of them. According to the witnesses, the Sasquatch stood its ground directly in front of the vehicle until it became scared by other approaching cars and quickly ran into the forest. This is the same area where there was a sighting by the Frank family in 2002. The women described the animal as covered in dark fur and between six and seven feet tall. They stated it looked more human than ape-like. Veteran Sasquatch investigator and biologist John Binderriagel did an in- terview for BCTV News showing vari- ous tracks castings he and his wife had found near Great Central Lake on Vancouver Island. He also mentioned that he believed it would only be a matter of time be- fore a Sasquatch is hit by a car, provid- ing proof to the scientific community that North America's Great Ape does exist.

JANUARY 2005 MUFON UFO JOURNAL 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"PERCEPTION; By Stanton T. Friedman Absence of evidence I really goofed in the column in the November issue. I said 18 Sept., 1952 as the date of the Eisenhower Briefing Document. The actual date was 18 Nov., 1952. My only excuse is that my daughter's birthday is Sept. 18. Over the years I have often recited the four basic rules for debunkers of UFOs (and most other topics): 1. What the public doesn't know, I won't tell them. 2. Don't bother me with the facts, my mind is made up. 3. If you can't attack the data, attack the people. 4. Do your research by proclamation, rather than investigation. Sometimes I have added a corollary: 5. Absence of evi- dence is not evidence of absence. There are many examples of this lat- ter approach, such as Phil Klass saying that there could not have been a Roswell crash or a Majestic 12 Group because the 900 pages of UFO mate- rial released by the CIA in response to a legal action in 1980 said nothing about either. Of course he neglected to mention that there were no formerly TOP SE- CRET documents in the pile. Karl Pflock took a similar approach in his book on Roswell. There are many other examples. But one of the most egre- gious examples of this false reasoning arrived in the mail in November 2004. The author of this 35-page tract is James T. Westwood of Military Science and Defense Analytics, who does \"his- torical research\" for various clients, in- cluding some UFO researchers. He claims to have shown, using \"his- toriographical\" methods and primary historical resources, that a UFO did not crash, and thus was not recovered, in New Mexico in July, 1947. His subject is \"Proving a Negative: The Ruse That Was Roswell.\" The three sources are Truman in the White House: The Diary of Eben Ayers, R.H. Ferrell ed. 1991, U. of Missouri Press; The Forrestal Diaries, Walter Millis, Viking Press 1951, and Stan Friedman a small diary kept by Truman himself, but not found until 2003. The lost diary can be found at www.trumanlibrary.org/diary/ transcript.htm. JW also places great trust in an unnamed source who claims to have been engaged in military duties in Forrestal's office until mid-Septem- ber 1947, and \"there never occurred in his keeping any printed or voiced mate- rial, data, or other informa- tion whatso- ever concern- ing the crash recovery of a spaceship from a distant planet.\" No reason is given for thinking he would have been aware of everything, no matter how classified, that happened in the office. Obviously Westwood hadn't checked the web or he would have noted that Truman's journal about his decision to use the atomic bomb \"was kept even from Eben Ayers, who had been directed to prepare an account of the atomic bomb decision during the Potsdam Conference\" (see www.he.net/-douglong/guide3.htm). Ayers was a press secretary. Would he be expected to have access to ev- erything? Hardly likely. The first prob- lem with JW's conclusions is that the three written sources are all unclassi- fied. Certainly one wouldn't expect to find TOP SECRET or TOP-SECRET Code Word material in them. Some say that surely all the material from 1947 has been declassified! NONSENSE. The Eisenhower Library told me in 2003 that they still have about 300,000 pages of classified material. JW himself notes that the Forrestal material had been carefully reviewed before being released in 1951. The sec- ond problem is: why should we expect that any of the sources cover everything that happened during the time period that was covered? I did an article in 2003 about the Truman diary. It only contained 42 handwritten entries. The first 160 pages contain member listings and advertise- ments from the Real Estate Board of New York, which had given him the diary. It was NOT classified. The July 2003 press release about the diary notes that Truman was an er- ratic diarist. Indeed. There are no en- tries between Jan. 16 and March 2; between March 31 and June 27; be- tween Oct. 1 and Nov. 17; and between Nov. 17 and Dec. 13. Would Westwood have us believe that Truman did nothing during these periods? In actuality, 1947 was a very busy year, what with the Marshall Plan, the growing cold war with the Soviet Union, the formulation of the Defense Department, the conversion of the Cen- tral Intelligence Group into the CIA, the establishment of the US Air Force sepa- rate from the Army Air Force, the es- tablishment of the NSC, etc, etc, etc. According to George Elsey, who worked for Truman the entire time he was in the White House, from April 1945 until January 1953, Truman was very security conscious. Elsey walked in one time when Truman was chew- ing out a senator for being careless about security. The diary entries seemed to be brief, mostly personal, notes such as a few which led press people to think that Truman was anti-Semitic when talking about a meeting he had with Henry Morgenthau about refugees. Westwood says nothing about hav- ing visited the Truman Library in Inde- pendence, MO, or the Firestone Library at Princeton University where the Forrestal papers are housed. Having spent time at both, I can at- 18 MUFON UFO JOURNAL JANUARY 2005"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"test to the fact that there are huge pa- per collections, including daily calen- dars in which are mentioned various meetings. Frequently the entries give no clue as to the subject of discussion. Westwood says nothing at all about the eyewitness testimony of people who were directly involved in the Roswell crash such as Maj. Jesse A. Marcel, In- telligence Officer for the 509 th Com- posite Bomb Group; his son (now Dr.) Jesse Marcel; retired Gen. Thomas Jefferson DuBose, chief of staff in 1947 to Gen. Roger Ramey, head of the 8 th Air Force, to whom reported Col. Wil- liam Blanchard, head of the 509 th . He makes no mention of the rancher, Mac Brazel, or his son Bill, or neigh- bor Loretta Proctor. Are these all liars? He doesn't mention the contemporary newspaper coverage in front-page sto- ries in evening papers from Chicago west on July 8,1947. I am surprised he doesn't try to use absence of an article about Roswell in the NY Times on July 8 as evidence for the absence of the crash. The press re- lease had gone out too late to make the NYT. Westwood can't be bothered refer- encing the books, which note the testi- mony and results of serious investiga- tions, such as my and Don Berliner's Crash at Corona: The Definitive Study of the Roswell Incident. (Autographed copies still available). Westwood's finding is: \"The three diaries make no mention, direct or by innuendo, of such a bizarre, sensational, and unlikely event as an ET 'hardware' crash and recovery in July, 1947, sen- sational books by such authors as Randle, Friedman, Moore and Berlitz and others since 1980 to the contrary. All of the diaries are frank ...Ayers spoke with the President almost every day....\"   : Surely Westwood is well aware of the need not only for high level secu- rity clearances, but a need-to-know for the information for the person involved. One might hope he would provide evi- dence that people with such clearances and need to know would discuss highly classified matters in unclassified en- tries, books, and comments. Often^ most people in a particular group would have a clearance-but no need to know-for particular TS Code word information. Amazingly, Westwood gives no example of such situations. President Truman became Vice President in January of 1945. He was not informed about the very expensive Manhattan Project to develop nuclear weapons until well after becoming President upon the death of President Roosevelt in April 1945. He hadn't had a need to know. President Eisenhower in his book Mandate for Change describes a meet- ing that he, as President Elect, had with President Truman at the White House on Nov. 18,1952, two weeks after the election, but two months before his in- auguration. Ike makes no mention of the fact that he and his advisors went directly to the Pentagon from the White House for a briefing on high level na- tional security matters. We know the meeting happened, not only because of an article in the NY Times, but because of desk calendar entries from others who were there, such as Army Chief of Staff Collins and US AF Vice-Chief of Staff and Majes- tic 12 member Gen. Nathan Twining. The entries, of course, give no clas- sified information as to what was dis- cussed. That Ike didn't mention it cer- tainly doesn't mean that it didn't hap- pen. Nov. 18,1952, is, of course, the date of the Eisenhower Briefing Document describing Operation Majestic 12. There surely weren't contemporary un- classified documents about the very highly classified Project Solarium in July, 1953, which set national policy vis a vis the USSR for many years. Westwood can't be bothered telling the reader why he considers the crash and recovery of ET hardware \" bizarre, sensational or unlikely.\" There were 2000 sightings of flying saucers during the summer of 1947. Why would it be surprising if some of them crashed? Plenty of our aircraft have crashed. The first clue that the US govern- ment had that the Germans were de- veloping rockets during the early years of WW n came from analysis of a piece of \"bizarre\" wreckage from a German test rocket that had crashed or exploded in Sweden. Westwood chastens those of us who have written in-depth investigations of the Roswell incident: \"None of the eminent ufologists that have written and spoken at insufferable length about the Roswell UFO event have ever men- tioned yet the Ayers and Forrestal dia- ries and what they do not reveal.\" This is true, but truly absurd. There are literally millions of pages at the Truman and Eisenhower Librar- ies and a multitude of other archives that say nothing about Roswell. Gold ore is worth mining if there is an ounce of gold in a ton of ore. Only one of hun- dreds of naturally occurring isotopes is fissionable. Should we say there is no gold in them thar hills or that no isotopes are fissionable? It is the evidence we have that matters, not that which we don't have. Westwood brags that even the Air Force reports on Roswell didn't take note of his \"sources,\" but makes the claim that \"they do make much of his- torical research and historiographical method.\" Quite frankly both government re- ports are loaded with false and mislead- ing statements and lies, and are easily shown to be splendid examples of pro- paganda-such as I have described in a paper, \"The Roswell Incident, The USAF, and the New York Times\" (27pg.l994, $4. Postpaid from me at FOB 958, Houlton, ME 04730-0958). Remember that the USAF \"Case Closed\" tried to explain reports of small bodies noted in connection with NM crashes as crash test dummies, none of which were dropped until at least six years after Roswell, and all of which were 6' tall and weighed 175 pounds. This isn't research. It is baloney. Most scientists that I know say that one shouldn't try to prove a negative. Westwood brags about doing so, and complains that others don't. If this rep- resents historiographical research, then I want no part of it. I don't feel my visits to 20 Archives and discussions with dozens of wit- nesses have been in vain. My goal has always been to find out what did hap- pen, not to determine what didn't. Stan Friedman, fsphys@rogers.com www.stanfriedman.com JANUARY 2005 MUFON UFO JOURNAL 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"By Jenny Randies Jenny Randies Poo Fighter legacy Sixty years ago this winter marked in many ways the starting point of the modern UFO mystery. The world was still in the final throes of war, and there was a heady mix of fear, dread, hope, and anticipation in the air. Amidst all this, the bomber crews flying from the UK into France, Ger- many, and other occupied Euro- pean lands were seeing strange lights that seemed to play tag with their aircraft and then just zip away. They were given the name foo fight- ers, and remain the source of much fascination and debate. It seemed to me a good idea to pon- der those early UFO reports from 1944/ 45 and see how they have influenced the way we approach matters today. Also to see if we can learn any useful lessons, as history is at its most instruc- tive when we apply its message to the world that we confront today. What is going on? â€¢ I have met a few witnesses who were directly involved in the foo fighter situ- ation. One of these was Michael Bentine, who became well known in Britain as a comedian (part of the group of young wits that inspired the later Monty Python era on radio and early TV, and went by the name of \"The Goons.\") During the war Bentine was an in- telligence officer who had the job of debriefing the crews that returned to the UK from free Polish bombing missions on the German rocket plant at Peenemunde. It was they who told him of these strange lights in what were some of the very first sightings. Bentine, describing to me his reac- tions, illustrates well how the mindset of human beings is always shaped by the circumstances that we face. His first question, of course, should have been what these lights were. But this was not phrased in the con- text of scientific endeavor, despite his personal scientific training. Yes, he briefly considered and dis- missed the standard options, such as St Elmo's Fire or similar atmospheric electrical discharges that might cause weird glows to form near aircraft. But his concern was principally whether these lights were targeting the bombers, and whether that meant that they were weapons, presumably devel- oped by the Nazis. As with his colleagues, Bentine phrased his questions to the puzzled witnesses entirely from the framework dictated by this presumption. What did the lights do, he asked? Nothing, was the mystified reply. So they were not much use as a weapon then, was his relieved conclusion. This did not help to solve the riddles posed by the foo fighter sightings, as Bentine well knew. But he had a very specific remit: to assess them as a threat. And once it was clear that they were not a threat, then it was really no longer important to the war effort to know what else they might be. As he told me years later, they are probably what we now call UFOs. But unless UFOs were interfering with the aim to defeat the Nazis, then they were not a priority. This might seem almost absurd, given our personal interest in UFOs, but it is perfectly reasonable if we put our- selves into the context of 1944. Sixty years later Shift forward six decades and we see the reason, I think, that modern UFO reports are treated with equal lack of imagination or application by both the powers that be and the scientific com- munity. Put bluntly, they do not seem to be a priority to either source, because they are neither a threat nor an obvious cause of real expectation that they might fur- ther progress. I think that UFOlogy suffered enor- mously from the legacy of the foo fight- ers when the sightings that we regard as part of our mystery began to be col- lected in the late 1940s. The question posed .again was one of threat potential. Were they Russian weapons, or, a little later, alien probes? Always these matters were pursued with a view to assessing the potential to disrupt. This perspective drove both official and scientific study into the hands of military and intelligence agen- cies, leaving them to make these threat assessments with very little recourse to either knowing or caring what the UFOs otherwise really were. So long as they were not causing us clear and immediate dangers, then they were not to be of much concern. The problem was that outside this rejection the sightings went on, and were not just witnessed by easy to con- trol people such as military bomber crews, but by everybody who could merrily talk to the growing media com- munity. Whatever the assessments made by military and intelligence officers the UFOs themselves remained real and mystifying. The self imposed secrecy and denial of the negative conclusions being formed inevitably made the blossom- ing UFO community imagine all sorts of conspiracies at work behind the de- nial of importance-behind what pioneer UFOlogists understandably saw for the escalating evidence. The result was, in my view, the mis- taken and distracting pursuit of cover- ups and secret knowledge obscured by the powers that be which has dominated too much of UFO thinking ever since, and yet that I doubt ever really existed. We lost sight of the true question, just as had those military and intelli- gence officers for their own different reasons. 20 MUFON UFO JOURNAL JANUARY 2005"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Israeli citizens left wondering Abduction report, UFO sightings By Mike Hallowell South Shields Gazette, England Recently I related to readers the chill- ing tale of Uri Sakhov, a retired cook who lived in Upper Nazareth, Israel. On Sept. 16,1996, Sakhov was ap- parently abducted by an egg-shaped UFO as he walked to his local post of- fice. Not everyone believed Sakhov's account, as there were no other wit- nesses to corroborate his strange story. All that was to change, however, when another UFO appeared within hours. At 2 AM the following morn- ing, a small but steady line of traffic Karl Pflock suffering from mysterious illness UFO investigator and author Karl Pflock has contacted several individu- als, including Journal editor Dwight Connelly, with the unsettling news that he is suffering from \"continuing and rather mysterious physical difficulties.\" He says, \"I won't bore you with the details, but manipulating a keyboard and mouse is a major chore. Needless to say, this puts more than just a crimp in my ability to write, respond to e-mail, etc.\" He adds, \"My neurologist has referred me to a world-class specialist in neuro- muscular diseases-Mayo Clinic trained and on the staff of University of New Mexico Hospital. We shall see what he's able to do for me. \"I'm also looking into what's available in the way of Mac-compatible voice- activated word processing software. \"Meanwhile, please do not rely on e- mail to communicate with me, as I will only infrequently be at the Mac and online for the foreseeable future, and will have an 'unable to respond right now' auto reply up. Instead, please use snail mail (10 Caminito Trail, Placitas, NM 87043-9417 USA) or the phone: 505/867- 0793.\" We all wish Karl a speedy and com- plete recovery. JANUARY 2005 was still snaking along High Road in the Ramat Aviv area of T61 Aviv. Sud- denly, one car screeched to a halt, forc- ing others to pull up sharply behind it. One by one, the drivers left their ve- hicles and stared incredulously into the night sky. Within minutes the call center at the Tel Aviv police headquarters found its phone lines jammed as scores of wit- nesses rang in to tell them about a \"light-emitting UFO\" carrying out spectacular aerial acrobatics above the city. Police officers and military person- nel were amongst the witnesses. There is a climate of fear in Israel, as there is in Palestine, due to the on- going unrest. Perhaps instinctively, sol- diers from the Border Police offered to shoot at the object in an effort to bring it down. Thankfully, wiser heads prevailed. The crowd turned on the soldiers and told them in no uncertain terms not to fire. One elderly woman, Maria Alimi, a shopkeeper, shouted, \"Are you crazy? What are you trying to do? Do you want to start a war between our world and theirs?\" Just before sunrise, the UFO ceased its amazing display of flying maneuvers and arced through the sky in an east- erly direction, seemingly following the path of Shaul Hamelech Avenue. Not to be outdone, dozens of motor- ists jumped into their cars and drove at speed down the same road in an attempt to keep the UFO in view. Perhaps not wanting to be followed, the craft sud- denly reversed direction and flew straight back to Ramat Aviv. It hovered again for a few moments, and then disappeared. On Sept. 25. the newspaper Ma 'ariv carried the headline \"Policemen and Citizens Saw a UFO in the North.\" That very morning, just after 3 AM, hun- dreds of Bedouin Arabs, along with, police officers, soldiers, and other citi- zens, saw a large UFO hovering over the village of Nugidat, near Upper Nazareth. One resident told reporters that the MUFON UFO JOURNAL craft emanated violet and blue rays which lit up a small mound behind a local mosque. The UFO was, \"shaped like a diamond,\" he stated. For four hours crowds watched in- tently as the strange object slowly bobbed and wove through the sky. Soon after sunrise it took off, leaving onlook- ers shaking their heads in bewilder- ment. The Chief of Police in Nazareth, Maj. Samuel Marmelstein, was soon faced with some extremely searching questions. To his credit, Maj. Marmelstein did not make up any silly cover stories. He simply told the truth: police officers had been dispatched to Nugidat, and, yes, they had indeed seen the UFO. Then other UFOs started to appear. Sixteen such encounters were reported in the daily newspaper Ma 'ariv alone. As word filtered out of Israel, some people wondered if the encounters were the fulfillment of Biblical prophecies. A few believed they signalled the end of the world. They didn't, of course, but these en- counters still left people wondering- wondering what they were, and, just as importantly, would they ever come back again? Only time will tell. Alexander Mebane dies at the age of 81 Alexander D. Mebane, 81, one of the original members of Civilian Saucer In- telligence of New York, died at his home in Venice, FL, on Dec. 4. \"He helped make Civilian Saucer Intelligence the serious and effective group it became during the 1950's and early 1960s,\" says researcher Ted Bloecher. \"His work and original thoughts on the mystery of the UFO phenomenon will not be soon forgotten.\" Researcher Dick Hall comments, \"Lex was one of the most intelligent, gifted thinkers I have ever known. His views on the phenomenon were always fascinating.\" 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Director's Message (Continued from page 2) You are all wonderful, and we ap- preciate you a lot. 2005 International UFO Symposium The 36 th annual MUFON Interna- tional UFO Symposium will be held on Friday, July 22, through Sunday, July 24, 2005, at the Marriott Tech Center Hotel in Denver, CO.

McLeod February 2005 Moon phases: Last Quarter-Feb. 2 New Moon-Feb. 8 First Quarter-Feb. 16 Full Moon-Feb. 24 Bright planets (evening sky) Mercury (magnitude -0.7 to -1.5): Mercury will be difficult to observe this month except for the last few days of the month when it will be very low in the west during evening twilight. Saturn (magnitude -0.2): In Gemini. Saturn will stand about 50 degrees high in the east-southeast at the end of evening twilight and will set in the west- northwest as morning twilight begins. Bright planets (morning sky) Venus (-3.8): Venus will not be vis- ible this month. Mars (1.4 to 1.2): Moving from Ophiuchus to Sagittarius. Mars will rise about 2.5 hours before the Sun in the southeast and will remain low in the southeast at the beginning of morning twilight. Jupiter (-2.2 to -2.3): In Virgo. Ju- piter will rise in the east before 10 PM, and will be more than 30 degrees high in the southwest at the beginning of morning twilight. Zodiacal light to be visible in some areas Zodiacal light will be visible in north- ern latitudes in the West after evening twilight, beginning Saturday, Feb. 26, and lasting two weeks. The phenom- enon is visible only from very dark lo- cations. Zodiacal light is the result of sun- light bouncing off dust grains in our solar system. These grains lie mostly in the plane of the solar system. Look for a pyra- mid of light in the evening sky some- what similar to the light from a city or town just over the horizon. Planetary Conjunction Feb. 26, 2005, at 10:00 PM. The Moon, and Jupiter as well as the bright stars Arcturus and Spica will be close together in the southeast sky. Planetary conjunctions, especially when the brighter planets and/or stars are involved, can be a source of sightings reports as observers unfamiliar with the night sky notice the grouping of bright lights in the sky. Conjunctions and Occultations: Feb. 27: Jupiter 1.2 degrees north of the Moon. Extraterrestrial life may be studied with bacteria A team of Australian scientists headed by Mike Dyall-Smith (Melbourne) has succeeded in cultivat- ing unique bacteria with rectangular and square-shaped cells. The majority of bacteria cells are spherical or rod- like in appearance. It was discovered that the microbe is extremely tolerant to magnesium chloride, which makes it the perfect or- ganism for studying what life might be like in extraterrestrial corners of the solar system. Scientists says that successful isola- tion and cultivation of square bacteria is also a very important step in under- standing the role they play in saline lakes' ecosystems. 24 MUFON UFO JOURNAL JANUARY 2005"}]
