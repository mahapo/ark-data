Lou Farish sends us an interesting item appearing-im. the -4pril 10.- 1966 issue of the \"Tulsa Dail-y W~rld,~' Tulsa, Okla. It was evident.?p. sent in by Edd Koch, of Lincoln, Ark., and follows: \"Back in 1901, we lived on a f~rm near New Haven, Yhssouri. A close neighbor of ours was telling of seeing a huge monster one night in the woodhnd secticn of our f2rm joiniqg his place. \"He described it as a monster as big as a locid of hay, with the shape of a turtle. It had three l2rge eyes that shined like lantern; and made a noise like a bumble-bee. Now old man ti drank a lot and us kids could hear the neighbors s~ving he w~s perhaps drunk and seen turtles instead of snakes, But his wife and their hired hand had seen it also. While the monster did not attack them, they nevertheless ran as fast as old man W did to get back to the house. The strange story put fear into us kids, but the old folks passed it off a= hallucination and ignorance. Now if this had happened In 1966 it woul; be simple and easy to understand by our learned men of today. he woui? be absolutely convinced it was either a flock of ducks or fhe planet Venus, a weather balloon or a bubble.of swamp gas that perhaps escape' from the Pentagon, \"Or perhaps to someone a little closer to it, it could even be s flying saucer. l' Editor's Note: The object was seen by three people--was large- dome-shaped and had th1.e~ 3 igl1t.s : alld a hl~rn~~i 11g- rloisc was h~ard. h'l--nt; do you think?"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"From SKYLOOK BULK ,RATE I U.
