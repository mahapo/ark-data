Many of these cases still remain under study, but several of these sightings involve large ob- jects described as triangular or boomerang in shape. On February 6, 1992, the Pennsylvania Association for the Study of the Unexplained (PASU) UFO Hotline began to receive information concerning a series of low level UFO sightings which reportedly occurred the day before near the city of Williamsport, PA in Lycoming County. PASU, which is established as a statewide volunteer scientific clearinghouse, investigates UFO sightings and other phenomena and works closely with MUFON; and as in many cases, the investiga- tion of such an incident involved joint cooperation. After I received some preliminary details about what had reportedly taken place, I determined that the investigator most qualified for this detailed investigation was Samuel D. Greco, Ph.D. I had known Sam for some time, and his engineering and military background would be most helpful in trying to determine the validity of these reports. Sam is a retired aerospace engineer, with many degrees to his credit. He also holds the rank of Major, U.S.A.F. retired. I contacted Sam, and he was glad to get involved, and soon began an indepth research project that would involve many weeks of traveling and meeting with various witnesses of these observations. Sam must be commended since he donated so much time and per- sonnal expense while being involved in this very important research study. While Sam would be handling personal interviews with some of the witnesses, I would be doing a lot of phone inter- views with others, as well as obtaining support data from various outside agencies. Our office coordinated incoming information on the reports and kept feeding Sam with cur- rent data and additional sources to interview. Since the inci- dent was fresh in the mind of the observers, it was imperative to document the information as soon as possible. It was quite evident that many people over a wide geographical area seemed to have seen something quite unusual, and we needed to eliminate any of the normal explanations for what was seen before considering the sightings as Unknowns. I also filed various FOIA requests to several government/military agen- cies, hopeful that someone could provide some answers. Within an hour of receiving the initial sighting informa- tion the investigation began from here. Local weather obser- vational data was obtained from the National Weather Ser- vice. A call was then placed to the state police barracks at Montoursville. I talked with a dispatcher there who was aware that they had received numerous sighting reports of a large low-level object in the sky, but said that no investigation had been launched. She did say that some callers were convinced that what they had seen was not a conventional aircraft. I then contacted the control tower at the Williamsport-Lycoming County Airport. I talked with an air traffic controller who had handled about 20 calls from the public, who wanted to know what the strange object was that had just passed through the area. He gave me what information he could remember, and told me that he contacted Harrisburg Approach Control to see if they were working any military aircraft, or were aware of any military fights in the area. They were not. W illiamsport Tower also had no confirmation of any military aircraft in the area, but speculated that this still could not be ruled out as a source of the reports since military aircraft training routes are not far away. Nothing unusual showed up on the radar at the airport during the obser- vation period, even though some reports place at least one of the sightings within a few miles of the airport. The Williamsport airspace is under the control of the FAA's New \\brk Center. I contacted the FFA Watch Supervisor, who had also received other inquiries about the sightings in the area. He also could find no records or flight plans for any military aircraft to have been in the area during the sighting period. While as of this writing, no agency has been able to provide data that supports military aircraft in the area during the obser- vation time, that still does not mean that such an aircraft could not have passed through these locations. But as we examine Sam's report, one must wonder if indeed something or somethings not typical of conventional aircraft were active in the Williamsport skies. L. Lee Janssen, a reporter for the Williamsport Sun-Gazette, wrote several articles on the sightings, and the paper received numerous reports from sighters as well. Most of the observers, regardless of whom they contacted about their sightings, wished no publicity; and as is our policy, those witnesses ask- ing to remain anonymous were so protected by Sam and myself. It is likely from the numerous written sighting statements sent to this office about this incident, as well as information we have obtained during this study, that possibly hundreds of people observed something strange in the skies over Pennsylvania. And now we continue with Sam Greco's report on his in- vestigation. Anyone with additional information is urged to contact me via the PASU 24 hr. UFO Hotline (412-838-7768), or in writing at PASU, 6 Oakhill Ave., Greensburg, PA 15601. Additional sketches based on eyewitness accounts were sup- plied by PASU Artist Charles M. Hanna. — Stan Gordon Stan Gordon is MUFON's State Director for Pennsylvania. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 290 June 1992"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"A Wave in Progress I was sitting in my recliner watching television, at about 2030 hours on February 5, 1992, when my telephone began to ring. After I answered it I heard Stan Gordon, the MUFON State Director for Pennsylvania, on the other end of the line. With some excitement, he informed me of what appeared to be a major UFO wave which had occurred about 1800 to 1900 hours in Williamsport, Lycoming County, Pennsylvania. Two different kinds of objects, boomerang and triangular- shaped, had been sighted in the evening sky and there had been numerous persons who had witnessed the sightings. He had received calls from some witnesses about their sightings and they wished to tell their story to someone who would listen. Stan asked if I would go to Williamsport to begin in- terviewing the witnesses, since MUFON did not have an in- vestigator in the Lycoming County area and I was the nearest available MUFON investigator. I accepted this task and so I asked Stan for names and addresses for two sightings. That evening I made interview appointments over the telephone with the witnesses for Friday, February 7, 1992. Friday rolled around rather quickly. As I left Mt. Carmel about 0800 hours and headed for Williamsport, it was a sun- ny but cold day, around the high twenties, and without any precipitation. By the time I had completed 13 interviews eight weeks later, I had a good idea of how extensive the sightings really were. Also, I had accumulated enough sightings which could be plotted on an area map of Williamsport. Sighting Scope The sightings investigated as of this writing occurred in four counties. In Lycoming County, seven of these had taken place in Williamsport or its suburbs. Two sightings were observed in or near the borough of Linden which is situated on U.S. Route 220 West. One took place near Cogan Station on Route 15 North. In Union County to the south, one sighting took place near the Lewisburg suburbs. In Northumberland County, east of Lewisburg, another sighting was reported. In the borough of Selinsgrove, Snyder County, one other sighting was made. Witnesses The witnesses who viewed the sightings were working class people: managers, factory workers, mechanics, nursing assis- tant, home health service worker, hospital unit desk clerk, college student, housewives and retirees. They were of good character, honest, religious, sincere in what they said, not given to exaggeration and they were able to describe what was seen clearly and factually. They were not interested in telling their story for publicity or profit and they did not want their names released to the public. Their desire was simply to tell their story to someone knowledgeable about the UFO phenomenon. Immediately after the sightings or the next day, the witnesses drew a sketch of what they had seen. Two per- sons who were non-UFO believers became believers. Some of the witnesses had seen the movie \"Close En- counters of the Third Kind.\" Two had read a few books or articles on UFOs, but most had not heard of them, knew lit- tle or nothing about them, or had heard something about them on television news stories. Eight enjoyed seeing the televi- sion series \"Star Trek.\" Four enjoyed viewing television documentaries about UFOs, such as those presented by \"Un- solved Mysteries.\" Two persons stated that they had psychic abilities. They were all in good health before and after the sightings. Some wore glasses which corrected their eyesight to 20/20 vision, and one witness stated he was color-blind. All had good hearing. One person had a hearing aid in the right ear, but his hearing in that ear was normal. None of them had any mental problems, such as depression, amnesia or other mental abnormalities. Weather Conditions The weather conditions on the evening of the sightings were clear but cold, about 25 to 36 degrees Fahrenheit. There was little or no wind and no precipitation. Some witnesses thought there was a moon, but they were not sure. One witness stated that the moon was out and that it caused the object to cast a shadow on the ground. All witnesses stated that there was sufficient light in the evening sky after sunset to cause the object to sustain a recognizable form or silhouette against the evening sky. General Data All the sightings, except one which began while the witness was outside on his driveway, started in the houses of the witnesses. They were in the living room or recreation room, in the basement watching television, reading the evening newspaper, or in the kitchen washing dishes. They were unaware of what was soon to happen. All the sightings followed a similar paradigm. First the sighting began while the witnesses were in the house attend- ing to various household activities. Next a loud or heavy rumbling noise was heard over the house which shook or vibrated the house and rattled its windows. Then one of the witnesses would leave the house to investigate the cause of the noise and, having discovered the UFO in the evening sky, would call the other witnesses to view the object. At this time, the witnesses would observe the object and its actions until visual contact was lost. Lastly they would return to the in- side of the house to reinforce each other on what was seen. Thus they could assure themselves of not being crazy or seeing hallucinations. Also, they would call other members of their family or friends in the area to ascertain if they had seen a UFO or heard the rumbling noise. It turned out that the sightings were widespread and were similar to those reported in Night Siege: The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings. However, these sightings showed other characteristics not detailed in that book. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 290 June 1992"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The Sighting Data Typically, a loud or heavy rumbling noise first shattered the tranquility of the evening. This noise was compared to the rumbling noise in \"Close Encounters,\" to the rumble of a heavily loaded freight train, to the rumble of Niagara Falls, to the rumble of a snow plow plowing the street, or to the noise of a loud diesel engine truck. The noise was unique in two aspects: first, when it was over the house it shook or vibrated the house and caused the windows to rattle; secondly, in all but one sighting, the witnesses did not hear a noise ap- proaching until it was heard directly over the house. When the first witness would reach the outside, either on a porch or on a driveway, the object had moved from its posi- tion over the house. It would be sighted at least 100 to 400 feet in front of the house and at least 70 to 500 feet in altitude. The witness of the triangular object stated he was outside directly underneath the object and was able to draw its shape from that viewpoint. After visual contact was made the primary witness would call the others to come and view the object. All witnesses reported the object moved at an unusually slow speed. They stated that the speed was so slow they could walk under it at a fast walking pace or a slow running pace and keep up with it. Against the evening sky, the object was dark or black and it had a recognizable form or silhouette as viewed by witnesses from their vantage point. The most prevalent form was the boomerang, also described as a Vee or banana shape. One was reported as a disc shape when seen from a predominantly side view. Another was triangle-shaped. An inverted pie-pan shape with a small flange around it, also described as slight- ly bell-shaped, was also reported. The object appeared solid to witnesses because of the noise it made, its obvious form or silhouette, and because of its sheer size. In one case it ap- peared solid because of the shadow it cast on the ground. The boomerang shape was approximately 100 feet to 600 feet, wing tip to wing tip, depending on the witnesses who observed it. The triangular shape was approximately 50 feet across at the rear of the slanted legs. The pie shape was approximate- ly 100 feet in diameter. The disc shape was approximately 150 feet in diameter. The thickness of the center section of the object was stated as the height of a commercial aircraft or from between 10 to 25 feet. However, one witness stated that it was 90 feet thick. W hite lights were observed at the rear of the object and the intensity can best be described as dull in most cases, but in two cases the lights had some degree of luminosity. They did not glow very brightly nor did they cast enough light to produce shadows. Their number varied from 1 to 14. One witness thought that perhaps they could be portholes. No beams of lights or searchlights were projected to the ground, except for one witness who stated he had seen a pulsed beam flash to the ground. It appeared to him that the pulsed beam was doing a ground search. Ten amber lights and two green lights were also observed on the triangular shaped ob- ject along with one white light which seemed to be on top of the object. The object appeared to be intelligently con- trolled because it moved in an approximate straight line and always maintained a dedicated altitude above the ground or over the tree tops. In one case, at Linden, the object turned left over the Susquehanna River towards Williamsport. Some witnesses stated it hovered in one or two places for 5 to 10 seconds as it moved forward. In another case the witnesses stated it hovered over the house for at least five seconds. In one case in Williamsport, it hovered over the driveway for five minutes and in another case, in Selinsgrove, it hovered for five minutes over a race track. M ost witnesses, when visual contact was made, were astonished at the sight of the object. They did not know what it was that they were looking at in the evening sky. Also, they wondered how such a large object could stay in the sky, how and why it flew so low, how it could fly so slow, and what caused it to make so much noise. However, they knew rather quickly that it was not a conventional aircraft, rocket, meteor, balloon, birds or some planet such as Venus. Most had flown as civilian or military passengers in com- mercial or military airplanes. They stated in no uncertain terms that they may not know what they saw but they knew what is was not. Some witnesses initially expressed fear when they first made visual contact with the object. However, when they realized that it was not something conventional, their fear left them and they became curious. In the triangular and disc-shaped sightings the witnesses expressed fear that the object would crash and they began to visualize the troubles such a crash would cause. Two witnesses, in separate sightings, stated that after the sightings were over they developed a cold later on in the evening. However, instead of the cold lasting 3 to 10 days, it ran its course of discomfort in about 24 to 36 hours. There were three other unique characteristics of the sightings. One was the feet that the noise was not readily heard before it was positioned over the house. However, in one sighting the witnesses stated they heard the noise coming. Witnesses reported they heard the noise fade away at some short distance from the house. A second characteristic was the lack of any minor or serious medical problems (except the reported colds) resulting from the witnesses being di- rectly under or near the object at such low altitudes — 50 to 600 feet. They did not report any problems from radi- ation, any electrostatic or electromagnetic effects acting on their body, any paralyzing effects, any hypnotic effects, lost time, or any unusual dreams or abnormal behavior that night or later on. One woman stated she felt lethargic for about three weeks after the sighting, but she attributed this condition to the fact that she had just changed jobs. The only electrical effects noticed in the house were lines on the television screen by those who had it turned on; one witness using the phone complained of excessive noise and had to hang up the receiver. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 290 June 1992"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The third unique characteristic was the strange presence of red, and red and green lights around the object. These lights were not on the object but appeared to be around it and seemed to be escorting or chasing it. The witnesses characterized these lights as small aircraft. Also, one witness thought that the object was definitely trying to get away from these aircraft. The red lights moved individually, and the red and green lights moved as a pair in unison. In one sighting, it was reported that these aircraft went into a frenzy when the object abrupt- ly disappeared over the race track. In two other sightings the objects abruptly disappeared at two separate locations over the Susquehanna River. In one sighting the aircraft appeared confused then faded away and in the second sighting they just faded away. A nimal behavior was what was expected from such en- counters as reported in the past history of the UFO. Dogs, cats, parrots and a rabbit showed signs of irrational behavior. The dogs became excited, began to run around the house in a frenzy and became afraid. Two dogs would not go outside the next day, and one of them hid under the bed all night. One dog did not react to the UFO or the noise, most probably because it was deaf. Three parrots got excited, fluffed their feathers and perked up their ears. A rabbit sought shelter at the rear-most part of its pen. All the animals recovered their normal behavior within a week. For most witnesses visual contact was lost when the ob- ject just faded away from view over Bald Eagle Mountain south of Williamsport. One witness to the triangular-shaped ob- ject stated that it abruptly disappeared at the base of a small hill about one-half mile distance from his house. Two witnesses in separate sightings stated that the object abrupt- ly disappeared when it reached the Susquehanna River. In two other sightings the witnesses stated it also abruptly disap- peared, once over the race track after hovering over it for five minutes, and once at the base of a small mountain. Newspaper Coverage Newspaper coverage was good and I managed to get copies of some articles which appeared in three regional newspapers. I was also interviewed in the interval by a newspaper reporter from Williamsport. I had a break in time between the first two interviews I had scheduled, so I called Laura Lee Jenssen of the Williamsport Sun-Gazette staff. She had talked with Stan Gordon about the sightings and learned that I would be in Williamsport on Friday, February 7, doing interviews. I had received a call from her on Wednesday night requesting an interview ses- sion. At Friday lunch, I informed her of my task, what the MUFON organization was all about, and gave her enough UFO information for a next day article titled \"Local UFO Sightings Probed: Fact or Flight of Fancy?\" When I returned home that evening, I sent her three UFO paperbacks to assist her investigations. The witnesses were ordinary people going about their daily lives. Ms. Jenssen wrote two additional articles on the sightings. One, on February 6, 1992, was titled \"Close Encounters with 'Galaxy' Likely,\" and another on February 15, 1992, titled \"UFO Mystery Continuing: Conflicting Evidence Grows.\" These articles referred to the numerous people who saw the objects and to those who had called the local authorities and airport personnel. Some people were reported to state that the objects were airplanes of different kinds. Comments by personnel from the FAA, the military, the local airport tower operator, state police, local police, and other interested peo- ple were also included. The state police were busy referring callers to the National UFO Reporting Center. Another reporter, Leon Bogdan of the Bloomsburg Press- Enterprise staff, wrote an article titled \"UFOs Are Buzzing Region\" for the Friday, February 8,1992, edition. He reports the efforts and information furnished to him on the sightings by Lester Derr,.an independent MUFON UFO investigator. In the Sunbury Daily Item there appeared two articles writ- ten by staff reporter Karen Blackledge on Thursday, February 6, 1992. One was \"Susquehanna Valley Residents Report See- ing Low Flying Lights,\" and another titled \"UFO May Have Been Military Jets.\" The first article reported on at least a dozen or more local and area residents who had seen the ob- jects in the sky. The paper received calls on the objects from Milton, Lewisburg and Shamokin. Personnel at Ft. Indian- town Gap, Muir Field, and airports at Montoursville, Selins- grove, and Harrisburg received calls, but none could explain what the objects were. In the second article, however, she reports that other larger airports in the state speculated that the objects were military airplanes. One person reported the object as a stealth bomber. Another person stated that it could have been the Soviet space station which would have been overhead at that time. Data Analysis The witnesses were ordinary people going about their dai- ly lives at the time the sightings took place. During the in- terviews they presented seemingly factual data regarding what they had both seen and heard. They were considered reliable, honest and sincere in their statements. From these collated interviews concerning the February 5, 1992 sightings, we can extract some pertinent data. The fol- lowing analysis is based on the format employed by the authors of Night Siege.

This time was as long as two minutes. Aircraft or UFO? This wave of sightings stimulates the human mind to try to determine what actually occurred on the evening of February 5, 1992. The data presented shows clearly that unusual objects in the sky were seen by numerous witnesses who were interviewed and who told their story to the in- vestigator as they had lived it. Other witnesses are known to have seen the object or heard the noise it made, since they revealed this fact by calling the local authorities. Two per- sons in separate sightings who were previously non-believers are now believers in UFOs. In trying to arrive at a meaningful solution as to what was observed in the evening sky, a good analysis will also deduce what the object was not, as follows: A. Not an Aircraft. The witnesses were familiar with commercial and/or military aircraft. Some had flown in the latter, all in the former. All the witnesses agreed that what they had seen was neither. Some made inquiries of local, state, and even out- of-state airport tower operators and were told that no aircraft blips had been seen on their radars at the time of their reported sightings. A spokesperson for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), when contacted by some of the witnesses and as reported in various newspaper articles, stated that no flight plans had been filed for the sighting area. He also stated that no flight rules had been violated since no complaints had been filed with them. A United States Air Force (USAF) Freedom of Informa- tion Manager, when contacted by Stan Gordon, stated that no military aircraft were operating in the sighting area. B. Same Time, Different Places. Different witnesses saw the UFO in different parts of the sighting area at about the same time. Some witnesses saw the UFO in two different parts of the sighting area and at a later time in the evening (see item 12 above). Since no aircraft were reported in the sighting area, the MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 290 June 1992"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"a m U) I o p I MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 290 June 1992"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"probability that the objects seen were something other than a UFO is extremely low. C. Extremely Slow Speeds. All witnesses stated the UFO was flying at a slow or very slow speed, and they could go at a fast walking or slow run- ning pace and keep up with it. This pacing translates into an approximate speed of 15 to 25 miles per hour. At these speeds, small aircraft are difficult to fly because of their inherent aerodynamic stall characteristic. Larger com- mercial or military aircraft cannot sustain these speeds in flight. In the landing mode they are \"flown in\" by the pilot until the wheels touch the runway whereupon braking (thrust reverser and brake) action occurs. D. The UFO was reported as very large. The size of the UFO was reported as being very large with a wing span of 50 to 600 feet. The largest wing span of a military aircraft is 223 feet (C-5A) and of a commercial air- craft 196 feet (747). However, none of these aircraft were reported to be in the sighting area. E. The UFO was seen to hover in the sky. There are three known types of aircraft which can hover - the Harrier Jet Fighter aircraft made in Great Britain, a helicopter and a blimp. Except for the blimp, these are all small in size when compared to what was seen by the witnesses. Balloons are seen in the sky on special occasions and very seldom at night. Further, they are at the mercy of the prevailing winds and their flight course is not certain. None of the above types were reported by governmental aviation agencies, the military or local area tower operators. F. The UFO lights were of a greater number and size than what is currently on aircraft. Each sighting witness reported large white lights at the rear of the UFO which could be clearly seen. One witness thought that they were portholes. These lights are not capable of being installed on small air- craft because of their large size and corresponding weight. Commercial and military aircraft have lights which must con- form to FAA and military regulations and are not nearly as large as those seen by the witnesses. .Cabin lights on these aircraft are located along the length of the cabin on both sides and there are a much greater number than those seen by the witnesses in any one sighting. G. The same UFO shapes have been reported in previous years. The shapes reported by the witnesses — boomerang, disc, and triangular — have been seen many times in the United States and several other countries of the world. H. The UFO abruptly disappeared from view in an instant. Witnesses of four sightings reported that while the UFO was in visual contact it abruptly disappeared from sight in less than a second and it was not seen thereafter. There are no known aircraft in the world which can abruptly disappear as reported by the witnesses. The USAF B-2 Stealth Bomber (flying wing) and the F-117A Stealth Fighter cannot be seen on radar, but they cannot abruptly disappear from sight in one second. If they can, it is a military secret. I. The UFO sightings took place over a large geographical area. The reported UFO sightings were seen west of Williamsport at Linden, east of Williamsport at Loyalsock Township, north of Williamsport near ,Cogan Station, and to the south of Williamsport at Selinsgrove. Although there are small and medium size airports in the sighting area, no aircraft were reported in the air by the con- trol tower operators. What Did the Witnesses See? The witnesses gave to the investigator an honest and truthful account of what they had seen on that evening of February 5, 1992. This was an experience they will not soon forget. They do not know exactly what type of flying object they saw, but they were adamant in their belief that it was not a man- made object. What then did they see? While there will be many people who will speculate or try to explain what the witnesses have seen, the data presented must be taken into account in any such explanation. There was an unusual object in the evening sky which the witnesses could not describe as something man-made. The object had a form or silhouette, it was very large in size, it appeared to be solid, it made a loud rumbling noise, it displayed lights on some parts of its form, and it was seen for a specific length of time. The object appeared to be under intelligent control because it flew in a straight line, it made turns, it hovered for various lengths of time, it abruptly disappeared from visual contact, it flew at a dedicated altitude, and it flew at an unusual slow speed. There were no aircraft in the sighting area reported either by commercial air sources, the FAA or the USAF. No rational or reasonable explanation has been advanced for any man-made object or astronomical object, event or con- dition up to the date of this writing. Perhaps with additional data from future sightings, it may be possible to draw a definitive conclusion for some form of flying object. Until that time, what the witnesses have seen must remain unexplained. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 290 June 1992"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"THE HYBRIDIZATION QUESTION By Jacques Vallee, Ph.D. I have only recently become aware of a paper presented by Dr. Michael Swords at the July 1991 MUFON Symposium in Chicago (1). It was entitled Modern Biology and the Ex- traterrestrial Hypothesis. It stated, in summary, that (a) the general appearance and behavior of ufonauts is consistent with modern biological knowledge and that (b) the concept of in- terbreeding between them and humans is incompatible with such knowledge. The paper argued that the conclusions of those who, like myself (2) and some European researchers, objected to the ETH on biological grounds, were \"products of either biases or ignorances.\" In some cases, they were little more than \"strongly worded opinions\" from people who had \"difficul- ty in keeping up with all the scientific thinking necessary to make competent pronouncements.\" The balance of Swords' presentation abandoned this polemical tone. It was cogent and represented a fair summary of relevant biological knowledge as it is generally taught. But it did not solve the argument and it failed to prove either point (a) or point (b) above. This is not the place for a detailed response. However, many of your readers have heard or read the presentation, and their attention should be drawn to three specific issues on which I believe the debate remains very much an open one. Issue number one: In one of the articles cited by Dr. Swords I had presented five arguments against what I called the first-level interpretation of the ETH. The conclusion of my article was not that the ETH should be thrown out altogether, but that it should be restated to take these arguments into ac- count (thus defining a \"second-order ETH\"). I also argued that other hypotheses should be considered. It is true that in my own opinion some of these other hypotheses are more attractive, and I do have a clear, honest disagreement with many ufologists on this point. Your readers may like to know that much has happened since this initial exchange: In an in- teresting response Dr. Robert Wood of McDonnell-Douglas presented new material on the side of the ETH, and a healthy debate was launched (3,4). It is still continuing. But it is an unfair oversimplification to state, as Dr. Swords does, that I regard the ETH as absurd. Issue number two: Dr. Swords' paper gives the impression that those who have critiqued the ETH on biological grounds have missed the point that alien life might very well be humanoid in shape. Indeed, he goes on to present a nicely- formulated scenario for just such a path for evolution on other planets. However, in my own formulation the biological discussion was only one of five arguments against the ETH, and within that specific topic, the actual shape of the organisms in question (the \"ufonauts\") was only one of several points, the others being the surprisingly good adaptation of the beings to our terrestrial gravity, atmosphere, light frequen- cy, language and culture, to such a degree that abductees and close-encounter witnesses have repeatedly spoken of recogniz- ing the emotions displayed by these beings. Clearly we need to explain much more than the mere shape of the organism here: we also need to explain acculturation and biological adaptation to the earth environment. Issue number three: The most straightforward part of Dr. Swords' paper would seem to be his critique of those who, like Budd Hopkins, Dr. David Jacobs, and others, are inclined to think of some abduction experiences in terms of the ufonauts' need for hybridization. I have criticized such views myself because it seemed to me that aliens equipped with the reported technology would have far simpler means of achiev- ing hybridization if such was their goal, without inducing trauma in human victims. Yet when Dr. Swords states categorically that, if such beings existed, we could never in- terbreed with them, he may be experiencing the same \"dif- ficulty in keeping up with all the scientific thinking necessary to make competent pronouncements\" which he observes among his colleagues. T he research conducted in Brussels and Paris by Dr. Miroslav Radman and his group is relevant here. For the last two decades this team has studied a remarkable biological process called 'mismatch repair' (5). Their research, which I have been following, has now been developed to the point where patents have actually been awarded for procedures that greatly broaden the prospects for artificial gene replacement and the creation of hybrid species. The procedures in question overcome the problem of the natural rejection of foreign DNA by target cells. They open the way to recombination between genes of different organisms that share a common evolutionary lineage. Thus the ques- tion of hybridization would be considerably altered if it could be shown that cosmic factors have made us \"distant cousins\" of a race of ufonauts. Modern biology has shown that the rejection of DNA with different sequences is effected by a specific set of naturally occurring enzymes. The normal role of these 'repair enzymes' is to survey the process of DNA replication. Occasionally DNA polymerase makes a mistake in synthesis, for exam- ple, introducing the base thymine opposite guanine instead of the normal cytosine. This creates a 'mismatch.' One of Dr. Vallee is a longtime UFO researcher. His most recent books in- clude Revelations, the third in his Alien Contact Trilogy, and UFO Chronicles of the Soviet Union: A Cosmic Samizdat, both from Ballantine. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 290 June 1992"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"the 'mismatch repair' enzymes then recognizes and binds to the mismatch. Another then unzips the strand with the er- roneous base. Finally, DNA polymerase correctly recopies the template strand to give a now perfectly-paired sequence. It is this mismatch repair process that has been studied by Dr. Radman's team. Conventional methods to obtain hybrids of species or of genes are inefficient. For example fusion cells produced from plant cells of different species are typically genet- ically unstable. They frequently revert to a parent cell type or are simply nonviable. To obtain individual hybrid genes and the resulting hybrid proteins, the only currently practical technology requires in vitro genetic engineering. However the procedures covered in the newest patents easily accomplish both species and genetic hybridization in vivo and do so with vastly improved efficiency. T he underlying principle of the new procedures is to inactivate the in vivo mismatch repair machinery and so enable the survival of mismatch-containing DNA duplexes formed during homologous recombination. Then the in vivo recombination machinery can successfully complete the formation of the hybrid genes. In the words of the Radman group, \"there are many ap- plications for this methodology, including the production of hybrid species from cells of different species or genera, or from cells of one species and the DNA of another. Also in- cluded is the generation of hybrid genes either by transfection ,of a cloned DNA gene to recombine with the target cells' homologous gene or by transfection of two plasmids each bear- ing a different version of the same gene.\" Two years ago a scientist working in Dr. Radman's laboratory, Dr. Christiane Rayssiguier, demonstrated the power of this novel approach (6,7). The bacteria E. Coli and S. Typhimurium are 'distant cousins' separated by 140 million years of evolution. Crosses between the two normal bacteria rarely produce recombinants; this is as expected since mating two different species is, by definition, sterile. However, when the S. Typhimurium parent was defective in mismatch repair, the recombination with E. Coli increased by a factor of ten thousand (8). Other experiments have shown that \"the mismatch repair system in E. Coli can readily be saturated under certain experimental conditions.\" The French researchers have made no claims that mutants could be found in higher cells and indeed, a defect in this repair system may well be lethal. However, the mismatch repair-saturation strategy has already been used to enable the introduction of exogenous sequences into mammalian cells in culture. Thus the idea of hybridization with ufonauts may be far-fetched and unlikely, but it is certainly not scientifically absurd. References 1. Swords, M. D.

MICHAEL SWORDS REPLIES A well-known UFO theorist has apparently decided to ob- ject to my paper delivered at the 1991 MUFON Symposium. Fine, it is a free country, and I'm sure that hundreds of others have decided that the paper is a product of UFOlogy's lunatic fringe as well. I'm getting more used to this. Complex topics cannot be legitimately discussed in a few words without giv- ing incomplete treatments and misleading impressions. Un- fortunately, UFOlogy begs for this sort of incompleteness and impression since it is of the greatest complexity. Vallee has decided that I did not prove my two major points and says that the debate remains very much an open one. This comes as little surprise to me, since my whole point was that no one has proved anything (probably about almost any con- ceivable topic), and therefore debate (and serious considera- tion of the ETH) should be kept open, despite anti-ETH articles such as his own \"Five arguments against...\". Far from attempting to prove things (a very unscientific attitude, generally), my presentation (indeed my entire brief career as a UFOlogist) has been to: a) warn people against strenuous- ly arguing to eliminate the ETH and any other defensible con- cept; but, secondly, b) pointing out where the current knowledge of the sciences would lead us to make our \"best guess.\" \"Best guess\" sounds like a reasonable way of behaving to me, and certainly not absolutist. Vallee's remark that the presentation didn't prove its points strikes at a straw man not constructed by me, and is not terribly productive in what should be a \"healthy discussion,\" as he phrases it. Vallee states that this is not the place for a detailed response. I agree ... for the reasons of not trivializing complex points, mentioned above. However, only a detailed discussion would be helpful, and therefore what he and I are doing here is not. Sorry, I apologize. But since forced, let's say some things briefly about his three issues. Issue one: I don't agree that the ETH has to be \"restated to take (Vallee's) arguments into account,\" unless it can be MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 290 June 1992"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"demonstrated that those (or any other) arguments need to be taken into account. The whole point of the MUFON talk was to show that the biological anti-ETH argument (this was all the MUFON talk addressed, so don't lumber me with respon- sibility for the others — they'll get addressed in later publica- tions, God willing) did not, 'given current knowledge, have to be taken as any sort of ETH \"problem.\" Bob Wood felt a need to address all five at once, and, fine, so he did. I chose to go into (with all due humility) some rather great depth to unravel the most complicated of the hypothetical arguments (which, by the way, was not inspired by Vallee's own work, but by materials going at least as far back as the great paleon- tologist, George Gaylord Simpson). Whether Vallee concludes that the ETH is absurd (which is not quite what I said of him, but OK) or not, is somewhat irrelevant, but at the same time, his public presentation of these views at the Society for Scien- tific Exploration left little doubt that he viewed the ETH as \"dead meat.\" Whyever else did he think that Bob Wood was \"inspired\" to respond so stalwartly, or I to immediately men- tion the things that I did in the Q & A of the same meeting? Issue two: This is puzzling to me in the extreme. Please read Vallee's comments about the need to not only explain bio- form similarity but also acculturation to gravity, atmosphere, etc. Then please read my paper which speaks not only of bio- form similarity, but also of gravity, atmospheres, etc. I can only assume that the respondent must have been reading a copy which was missing several pages. Since I personally sent him a copy as a courtesy, I know that the copy was complete at least on entering the U.S. Post Office at Kalamazoo. I would like to ask for the minimal courtesy of actually reading the complete text before crying foul. And, on the issue of language and culture, does anyone honestly believe that intelligent bioforms would be incapable of acculturation to those elements in us, especially to the behavioral extent that they seem typical- ly to employ? Issue three: This is another objection to my paper, which indicates that the respondent either did not thoroughly read the paper or did not thoroughly understand it. Since Vallee has demonstrated his capacity for intelligence many times, I must assume that this is another case of a busy man who has not had the time to properly read the relevant literature (i.e., in this case, the MUFON paper). The entirety of the science by the Radman group may well be accurate, impor- tant, and pointing to the future potential of genetic engineer- ing. It foreshadows exactly what the MUFON paper talked about: the ultimate ability of an advanced technology to manipulate genes so thoroughly that they could hybridize anything (the \"Super ET Biotechnicians,\" as the paper called them). The current editor of the MUFON Journal, also an Dr. Swords is a professor of natural sciences at Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, and editor of the Journal of UFO Studies, published by the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies. intelligent man, but one who read the entire piece and understood its thrust, properly characterized this level of technology as one wherein there is no longer the need to mess about with humans, oocytes, et al, as the Technicians can now do the gene-making and manipulating essentially \"from scratch,\" (and certainly from far more available materials). The only way someone reading the MUFON paper could miss this is if they didn't read it, or are not educated enough in the nature of genes, chromosomes, and sexual reproduction to get on \"talking terms\" with the concepts. I don't blame anyone for the latter: as the African proverb says, \"He who does not know one thing, knows another.\" I am constantly being educated by all of you on UFOlogical matters in this huge field of which I am a recent part. F inally, to return to a point which probably would be best left alone: my views on \"biases and ignorances.\" I don't back off that one bit. I believe that / am, obviously, both biased and ignorant. I believe that it is the \"human con- dition\" to be so. We walk around receiving limited informa- tion, and using it to try to construct a reality with which we can cope. The consequent Cosmos which we envision con- tinues to direct our quests and our beliefs, and filter our knowledge. Jacques Vallee, Carl Sagan and Michael Swords are all \"ignorant\" despite rather heroic efforts on their part not to be. And they're all biased to — in each case — some rather powerful visions of what's real, what's likely and what's possible. What I'm rather \"tired\" of, is people, who are by human nature \"ignorant and biased,\" telling other people what not to contemplate (such as the ETH, Parallel Realities, Time Travel, Spirituality or whatever). What I try to do is present, as best I can, the information at the frontiers of science, and how that may relate to UFO phenomena, especially as regards people who try to close the doors on certain major theories. This stuff is complex, and I don't always get the job done. Sorry. Also I get excited once in a while and state something a little too strongly, but if one reads the whole article one will see that I'm saying this seems to be the best guess right now, folks. If this response seems a trifle miffed, it is due to the fact that all of us (you as readers and I as writer) pro- bably had better things to do with our tune here than respond to (and read about) \"issues\" which were brought up without even reading the entire material.

Copies have been distributed free of charge to some 100,000 health professionals in this country, an unprecedented event that closely coincided with the airing on CBS-TV in May of this year of a two-part, four-hour miniseries, \"Intruders,\" based on the Budd Hopkins book of the same name. Hopkins is also one of the principal authors of the report in ques- tion: Unusual Personal Experiences, subtitled \"An Analysis of the Data from Three National Surveys Conducted by the Roper Organization.\" The other two are Dr. David Jacobs, a professor of history at Temple University and the author of Secret Life (Simon & Schuster, 1992), and Dr. Ron Westrum, a professor of sociology at Eastern Michigan University. Additional commentary is supplied by Dr. John E. Mack, a Harvard professor of psychiatry, and John Carpenter, a licensed clinical social worker in Springfield, Missouri, and MUFON's director for ab- duction research. For simplicity's sake, the 64-page booklet will hereinafter be referred to as the \"Roper Report.\" The Roper Organization itself is one of the country's more well-respected independent polling institutions. In this case they conducted almost 6000 face-to-face interviews with a cross- section of American adults, armed with an 11-item questionnaire osten- sibly focusing on \"unusual experiences.\" (The considerable cost of the project was paid for by Robert Bigelow, a Las Vegas real estate developer, and a second benefactor who wishes to remain anonymous.) Five of the questions were actually designed by Hopkins and Jacobs, project co-directors, to identify potential abductees. To \"qualify\" as same, a respondent had to answer positive to at least four of the five target questions, as follows: •Waking up paralyzed with a sense of a strange person or presence or something else in the room. • Experiencing a period of time of an hour or more, in which you were apparently lost, but could not remember why, or where you had been. • Feeling that you were actually flying through the air although you didn't know why or how. • Seen unusual lights or ball of light in a room without knowing what was causing them, or where they came from. • Finding puzzling scars on your body and neither you nor anyone else remembering how you received them or where you got them. Six other conditioning or \"control\" questions were asked, including one based on the nonsense word, \"Trondant,\" aimed at measuring any positive response bias. Some surprising results emerge from the col- lated data of the three Roper polls, given to a total of 5,947 Americans between July and September of 1991. Perhaps the most surprising of all is the fact that 18 % of those polled reported having awakened at one time or another in a paralyzed state with the sense of some other presence in the room. An extrapolation of this percentile, based on an adult population of 185 million, yields an extraordinary 33 million people who might presumably be expected to report a similar ex- UNUSUAL PERSONAL EXPERIENCES Budd Hopkins, David Jacobs & Ron Westrum Bigelow Holding Corporation Las Vegas, NV, 1992, 64 pp. UFO CHRONICLES OF THE SOVIET UNION: A Cosmic Samizdat Jacques Vallee in collaboration with Martine Castello Ballantine Books, NY, 1992, Illus., 212 pp., $18.

Thirteen percent reported missing time, extrapolating to 24 million people, while ten percent (18.5 million) reported a feeling of flying. Eight percent had encountered balls of light in their room (14.8 million), and the same percent also reported unusual scars. (Other questions included have you ever seen a ghost, 11%; a UFO, 7 %; had vivid dreams about UFOs, 5%, and so on. Only one percent reported the word TRONDANT.) Interestingly, people deemed \"political/social actives\" by the Roper polling data were significiantly more likely to report these unusual experiences than their less influential counterparts. T wo percent (one out of every 50) of those polled re- sponded positively to four or more of the five target ques- tions suggestive of an abduction experience. Extrapolated across the American adult population, that represents a stag- gering 3.7 million individuals who may have been \"abducted\" or who believe they may have been. The total number of ac- tual abductions, assuming that's what we're dealing with here, may easily be three or four times that, given that many report repeat experiences. The final total could well approach ten million or more. The various interpretations of what the Roper Poll results really mean will just be getting underway as you read this. However, look for the Roper Report to be one of the most hotly contested UFO issues ever, as abductionists and diehard debunkers alike take square aim at one another over the reality of the experiences reported. Are they real, physical events taking place in a solid, three-dimensional world involving ex- traterrestrial beings; or some as yet unexplained complex of psychological events; or, conceivably, something somehow in between? Do the five individual questions \"add up\" to an actual ab- duction event as a whole, or should they be treated and in- terpreted separately? Is it logical, for instance, to draw a direct line between a ball of light seen at night in one's bedroom and, say, an anomalous scar discovered days, months or even years later? If two percent of the polled population has been abducted, then what happened to the other six percent who reported balls of light? What did they see? Similarly, if two percent were abducted aboard a UFO, what happened to the other 16 percent, or some 30 million people, who report wak- ing up in their beds, paralyzed,, with the sense of another presence in the room? The \"answer\" may (or may not) lie in a similar study con- ducted in the mid-1970's, albeit on a much smaller scale, by behavioral scientist Dr. David Hufford, and subsequently published as The Terror That Comes in the Night (Univer- sity of Pennsylvania Press, 1982), subtitled \"An Experience- Centered Study of Supernatural Assault Traditions.\" The particular form of supernatural assault that Hufford investigated was the Old Hag tradition of Newfoundland, an experience involving both paralysis and the sense of a suf- focating presence with at least superficial similarities to the medieval accounts of assault — with definite sexual overtones, — by so-called incubi and succubi, so distinguished by whether the assaulting spirit was supposedly lying atop, or under, the victim respectively. Hufford found the overt sex- ual component of the incubus experience largely lacking in Hag attacks; instead feelings of fear and dread were much more likely to be present. Interestingly, though, he found that a commonly reported secondary component of the Old Hag experience consisted of a numinous quality, often a nebulous light source, that perceptions were sometimes heightened (and sometimes blunted) and that, in general, 75% or more of any population, across cultures, were consistently likely to report the experience. He concluded, in addition, that \"cultural fac- tors heavily determine the ways in which ('hagging') is des- cribed (or withheld) and interpreted,\" and that \"the contents of the experience cannot be satisfactorily explained on the basis of current knowledge.\" A re the Old Hag and UFO aliens one and the same? Or put another way: perhaps being hagged is phenomen- ologically analagous to being abducted, the difference being in the details, i.e., the cultural conditioning that determines how the experience is originally perceived and reported. As I said, the debate over how the Roper Report is to be read and interpreted is just beginning! In the meantime, credit where it is due: to the principal authors for proposing and overseeing this important project (and providing us with much food-for-thought for many years to come); and to Robert Bigelow and his anonymous partner for funding the original surveys and for then making 100,000 copies available to the American medical profession. All are to be congratulated for this monumental and massive scien- tific step in the right direction, regardless of where it finally falls.

A case in point is the latest offering from the once-again-prolific Jac- ques Vallee, UFO Chronicles of the Soviet Union: A Cosmic Samizdat. Samizdat is a Russian word that refers to a docu- ment surreptitiously copied and circulated among a circle of select friends. For much of the modern Communist era that is the way ufology has been carried out in the Soviet Union. Or at least real ufology. Reports of UFOs — the more sensa- tional the better — have occasionally, if only fairly recently, graced the front pages of the more popular and sensational tabloids. But serious investigation of anomalous aerial phenomena in the USSR has been persistently hampered by an official dogmatic mindset that Western ufologists only dream of in their worst nightmares. At least we are relative- ly free to travel and talk to witnesses at will, publish in- vestigative reports and so on. But when Gorbachev allowed the Berlin Wall to come tumbling down, the world changed. One of the first post- perestroika UFO stories to \"flee\" West involved a series of convoluted sightings — including landed objects and associated humanoids — that occurred in the city of Voronezh, several hundred miles southwest of Moscow. As might have been ex- pected, the American press treated the September 1989 Voronezh sightings as silly season material, proof positive, when all would be finally said and done, that the Russian populace really was a superstitious lot, much like our own unwashed masses, in fact, or at least the large unwashed por- tion that was always reporting UFOs. That the sightings were originally announced through the Moscow AP office of Tass, the official Soviet news agency, didn't seem to help much. For one thing, the reports were outlandish, even by normal Western standards. A large glow- ing ball had floated to the ground in one of the city's parks and three large entities, 10 to 13 feet tall, with small heads and three eyes were seen walking about the landed craft. They were accompanied by a small robot. Soviet scientists had in- vestigated, it was reported, and had traced the aliens' \"pro- menade\" in the park by means of biolocation. Actually, most of the major American newspapers that bothered to carry the story, including the august New York Times, bungled the original newswire, substituting \"bilocation\" for biolocation. Bilocation, of course, is the ability to be in two places at the same time, often reported of Catholic, and other saints. Biolocation, as used in the Soviet Union today, is similar to dowsing; supposedly it detects subtle energy fields. T he Western UFO press, such as it is, reacted cautiously as well, probably out of fear of not wanting to be lumped in the same category with their so patently \"gullible\" Soviet counterparts. Now that the gates of glastnost are wide open a reassessment of Soviet ufology — and the Soviet UFO cases — is obviously in order. And while Chronicles isn't the definitive study of UFOs in the Soviet Union by any means, it is the first book of its kind to take us by the hand on a somewhat hurried stroll behind the old Iron Curtain and its almost utter shroud of secrecy. Vallee obviously has doors open to him that few other ufologists — American and Euro- pean — could ever hope to walk through. Not surprisingly, it turns out that the Soviet Union has had its fair share of UFO reports all along. By re-emphasizing the June 30, 1908 Tunguska event, however, in which an unknown object exploded over the Siberian tundra with the force of a 30-megaton nuclear device, Vallee runs the risk of stretching the point a bit thin. In fact, he devotes an entire chapter to the subject, almost as if it were the Russian equivalent of Roswell. The following chapter, \"For the Record: A Brief History of Soviet Ufology,\" fares considerably bet- ter. Even so, there are some understandable gaps. A chart, for instance, refers to the years 1947-1956 as the \"First Dark Period.\" Unfortunately, the Second Dark Period begins five years later and runs through 1966, while the third lasts from 1968 to 1988. This doesn't mean that cases from these time periods are completely absent, only that civilian Soviet ufology was forced to labor under a Communist hegemony that fre- quently viewed UFOs in the same light as rock'n'roll and other socially degenerative, capitalist-inspired cultural diseases. C onspicuously absent from this catalog of pre-glastnost Soviet UFO reports, however, is one made by a United States Senator! On October 4, 1955, Richard Russell, Democrat, Georgia, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, consultant Ruben Efron and Lt. Col. E. U. Hathaway were on a train in the Trans Caucasus region bound for Kiev and ultimately Prague, Czechoslovakia. To the south of the train Russell suddenly saw a flying disk slowly ascend- ing in a vertical fashion. Its outer surface appeared to be revolving to the right while a flame or spark shot out of the bottom. At a height of about 6000 feet it suddenly shot off to the north at a high rate of speed. A minute later a second similar object performed almost exactly the same maneuver and was witnessed by all three men. A report of the incident was subsequently filed with the U.S. air attache at the American Embassy in Prague. Some things the Soviets just couldn't keep secret ... Vallee's feel for current history proves much more acute. His account of his and Le Figaro science correspondent Mar- tine Castello's visits with leading Soviet ufologists in Moscow and environs has a ring of personal immediacy and sense of place missing from most UFO books. American ufologists, at least, generally have no trouble rounding up a good cup of Joe when they want one. In the Soviet Union, it appears, one stands about as good a chance of seeing a UFO in person. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 290 June 1992"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"But Vallee's personal experiences aside, I'm not sure he's completely made his case here. On the one hand he argues (and rightly so) for accepting Soviet UFO reports at something approaching face value. No reason to stigmatize a case neces- sarily because it emanates from behind the old Iron Curtain; nor is there an ipso facto reason for the average American ufologist to adopt an air of scientific and intellectual superior- ity to his or her Soviet counterpart. (They have H-bombs and the orbiting Mir laboratory, too, remember.) On the other hand, Vallee himself complains of the Soviet equivalent and presence of much \"New Age\" nonsense. It's never completely clear, however, where Vallee himself comes down in regard to the practice of biolocation. Is it a legitimate technique for investigating physical landing-trace cases or not? If so, surely it should be considered as a last resort, after all other legitimate avenues have been exhausted. While Vallee voices doubts about such practices, they never seem to bleed over into other areas. It's become almost fashionable now for every UFO con- ference to bring over its own Soviet specialist. Culturally and politically such actions are to be applauded. But the rush to greet glastnost with an open mind shouldn't blind us to reality. New Age nonsense is New Age nonsense, whether it emanates out of Voronezh or Berkeley, California. Extraordinary claims still need to be backed by at least ordinary evidence. UFO Chronicles of the Soviet Union is at least a step in the right direction. It may not be a handbook as to who and who not to trust, which was never Vallee's original intention, but it does open a window on a sizeable segment of the UFO world which was once tightly and securely shut. And a little fresh air never hurt anyone. Hopefully, works such as this will help pave the way for greater interaction and coopera- tion among ufologists who once found themselves on opposite sides of the Cold War. Let's look forward to a very Warm Peace among friends. T he third volume (New Series) of the Journal of UFO Studies, under the able editorship of Michael Swords, has just appeared and can't be recommended too highly. Published annually by CUFOS (the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies, Chicago, IL), the Journal retails for $18 (postage and handling included). Order from CUFOS: 2457 West Peterson, Chicago, IL 60659. Anyone pretending to a scientific interest in the subject of UFOs is hereby advised to support this publication, one of only two such refereed publications in this country (the other being the more eclectic Journal of Scientific Exploration, published by the Society for Scientific Exploration). The current issue consists of 183 pages of densely packed text, or nearly about as much information as one would ex- pect to find in a full length book on the subject. Lengthy feature articles are presented by Thomas E. Bullard, Ph.D. (\"Folkloric Dimensions of the UFO Phenomenon\"), Mark Rodeghier, Jeff Goodpaster and Sandra Blatterbauer (\"Psychosocial Characteristics of Abductees\") and John S. Carpenter (\"Double Abduction Case: Correlation of Hyp- nosis Data\"). The latter case, incidentally, was first previewed in the November 1991 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal. Another sizeable chuck of the Journal is devoted to an up- date and re-analysis of the now infamous 1971 Delphos, Kan- sas, landing trace case, commentary and findings supplied by Swords and Erol Frank of the United Kingdom. The \"Comments and Responses\" section is devoted to several pointed exchanges, most concerning the abduction aspect of the phenomenon. Authors include Robert Baker, David Jacobs, David Gotlib of Toronto, Canada, Kenneth Ring, Hilary Evans and others. This amounts to academic give-and-take at its finest, fast-food intellectual take-out, as it were, for us otherwise largely couch-bound UFO potato heads. Try it with a little salsa and the corn chips of your choice; I think you'll like it. The final topping is a retrospective book review (and ap- preciation) by editor Swords of Edward J. Ruppelt's landmark classic, The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects (1956). We could all use more of the latter. Too often we forget the original works and inspiration which shaped our first perceptions of the UFO phenomenon. Editor Swords (a MUFON consultant) has done himself proud.

IN OTHERS' WORDS By Lucius Parish UFO abduction cases are the focus of an article in the May 19 issue of NATIONAL ENQUIRER. The TV miniseries \"In- truders\" is discussed, along with several cases of genuine ab- ductions. Georgetown University professor of psychiatry Dr. James Gordon is quoted as saying that abductees \"are not men- tal cases or publicity hounds ... As far as I can determine, they are telling the truth.\" The \"AntiMatter/UFO Update\" section in the April issue of OMNI featured accounts of UFO abductions in large cities, as opposed to the common view that such events happen on- ly in isolated areas. The activities of the Fund for UFO Research are highlighted in the May issue of OMNI. Salvador Freixedo's book, VISIONARIES, MYSTICS AND CONTACTEES, mentioned in a previous column, is now available at bookstores or directly from the publisher (LlumiNet Press, P.O. Box 746, Avondale Estates, GA 30002). Although Freixedo has written several books, this is the first to be translated into English. He contends that human interac- tion with non-human intelligences can be traced back to the beginnings of recorded history.

Ronan Savinsky, Squadron 301 of the Royal Air Force, Polish Division, describes his close en- counter with a UFO while on a bombing mission over Europe: \"We were flying over the Ruhr Valley in Germany. We drop- ped the bombs on the target and on the way back we were flying over Holland. My rear gunner reported an aircraft ap- proaching from the rear. I told him if this object comes too close then we will have to open fire on him. My idea was that it was perhaps a German fighter equipped with a search- light in the nose. So when this thing pame close I wouldn't take any chance on it and I told my rear gunner to give him a blast. Then he opened fire on him, maybe at 200 yards. At that distance this object was about the size of the moon which was also visible at the same time, maybe a lot bigger. \"While the rear gunner was shooting we could follow the trajectory of the tracer shells which were entering that par- ticular target. Now the peculiar thing about it is that they were just going in and that was the end of it; they wouldn't fall away. Those tracers would just enter and that was it. That lasted for maybe two minutes and after that time this shiny object changed position and at terrific speed moved over to our port side, almost at the same distance, about 200 yards from the wing, and then it stayed there. Then both the rear gunner and front gunner opened fire on my order. I could see the tracers entering the target again from the two angles. After a while it took off at fantastic speed at a 45-degree angle and just disappeared in the stars. The aircraft that was behind me had the same experience within a few minutes after I had mine.\" (78 RPM recording, \"UFO\") June 1947 • While driving down a rural road on the after- noon of the 24th, Bill Schuening figured the humming noise that he heard was a tractor. But instead, when his pickup rumbled over the rise and he looked across the field some 200 or 300 feet away, he saw a disc-like object suspended five or six feet off the ground. \"I would have given anything to have had a camera with me,\" he said. \"It was definitely there,\" hovering above the rolling farmland some 25 miles north of Pendleton, Oregon. That same afternoon, Kenneth Arnold landed his plane in Pendleton and told reporter Bill Bequette he'd just seen nine shiny, flat objects streaking across the sky at incredible speed. \"My boss told me about a flying disc story and I told him I saw one too,\" Schuening said. \"I told my wife about it. She said that I was crazy to say anything about it. Everyone said we were just saying things.\" Lester King, for whom Schuen- ing was ranch foreman for 17 years, convinced him to go to town and tell others what he'd seen. And Schuening says he saw more than just a disc. \"There were two little guys in green suits with white helmets standing right underneath it. They were no taller than this,\" holding his hand at waist level. Schuening said he watched the helmeted beings for a few seconds and then \"they were gone. How they got in (the craft) I'll never know. Suddenly they were just gone. Moments later the craft zipped away toward the Columbia River, made a big circle, and headed over the mountains.\" (The East Oregonian, Pendleton, OR (6/26 and 30, 1947 & 6/24, 1987) June 1952 • \"The day was hot and clear, except for scattered clouds,\" reported John C. Williams, a former Navy pilot. \"It was about 6:30 p.m., and the sun was still fairly high. My wife and one of our guests were watching the sunset reflections on Cochise's Hide-Out, north across the valley, when they sighted a strange object flying toward Tombstone, Arizona, from the direction of Tucson. My wife called the rest of us and we were amazed to see this huge, circular object in level flight somewhere between 20,000 and 30,000 feet.\" Sudden- ly, Williams said, the UFO stopped in midflight. It hovered, oscillating or tilting from side to side for several moments. Then it reversed its direction and retraced its course. \"Two times, it repeated this performance,\" Williams said. \"There was no noise whatever. We saw no lights nor any evidence of a jet stream or exhaust.\" As the UFO hovered, Williams and his guests could distinctly see the shape of the strange craft. \"It looked like two saucers, one inverted on top of the other,\" Williams said. \"I estimated the diameter to be at least 300 feet, though it could have been greater, depending on the altitude. It left at a slight climbing angle. Its speed was unbelievable. It headed northwest toward Tuc- son, diminishing to a tiny speck and then vanishing, in about four seconds.\" The former Navy lieutenant commander's opinion, based on his sighting and evidence he had heard, was that UFOs are controlled, apparently metallic, machines from outer space. \"I don't know where they come from, but I have the feeling we are being observed and studied by these outerspace beings.\" (Flying Saucers: Top Secret by Major Donald Keyhoe) June 1957 • On the night of the fifth, several Indians brought a friend to a village named Uriman in Bolivar, Venezuela, to have a deep gash in his arm treated. A Captain for the Linea Aeropostal Venezolana Airlines, who was on the scene, ques- tioned the Indians and was told that they had seen a luminous object land and little beings emerge from it. They tried to catch the short occupants, one of whom slashed at an Indian and cut his arm. The Indians became frightened, let the lit- tle beings go, and hurried to the village to have their com- rade treated. These details were related to another airline pilot by the LAV pilot who interviewed the Indians. The general consensus of opinion in Uriman was that the Indians saw and experienced what they claim they did. (The A.P.R.O.

The plane was piloted by Captain Vivas with copilot Rafael Hernandez while flying the route between Puer- to Cabello and Valencia, Venezuela. All observers agreed that the object was luminous, flat, slightly round and traveling at a fantastic rate of speed. On the ground, people residing in the region of El Cambur, near the highway connecting Puer- to Cabello and Valencia, also reported seeing the UFO, thus confirming the sighting from the aircraft. (The A.P.R.O. Bulletin, July 1957) June 1967 • (The following report was investigated by the Department of National Defense, Canada, and was released for publication by Dr. Peter Millman, of the National Research Council, Canada.) While returning home by boat on a lake in northern On- tario, Canada on the 18th, Mr. and Mrs. G. noticed a bright oval-shaped object with a slight rise on top hovering about 50 feet above the treetops approximately a quarter of a mile away. They turned their boat toward the object to observe more closely when the UFO suddenly and at great speed descended toward their boat. Mr. G. made a very hasty retreat, using full power to make shore and get out of the boat. The object then returned to its original hovering position. A second at- tempt to move the boat was aborted when the UFO appeared to make another rapid descent toward the boat. The object hovered in the area for 10 to 15 minutes and then rapidly disap- peared to the west-northwest. The couple said the object was about 25 to 30 feet in diameter and about 10-15 feet at the thickest point. No sound was heard. (The UFO Experience by Dr. J. Allen Hynek) June 1972 • Two police officers and a farmer fired a total of 15 shots at a hovering UFO on the 26th near the town of Fort Beaufort, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. Ber- nardus Smit, 40-year-old owner of Braeside Farm, located nine miles from Fort Beaufort, sent an employee to inspect a dam about 8 a.m. The worker, Boer de Klerk, saw something burning among thick trees. \"Who is making fire?\" de Klerk shouted. When no answer came, he moved closer. He sighted a glowing, shiny object bobbing up and down and then moving to an overhead position. The laborer ran to the farm and led Smit to the site. The oval-shaped craft was still there, glowing brightly and changing colors. A white, spherical, starlike light glowed on the righthand top edge. \"I was really scared,\" Smit said. Smit called the Fort Beaufort police. Station commander Warrant Officer Peter Van Rensburg and Sergeant PC. Kit- ching arrived at the farm about 10 a.m. Smit, the two policemen, and three other farm workers proceeded to the sighting location. When several hundred feet from the UFO, Smit and Sergeant fired at it. \"After both Smit and Sergeant Kitching had fired a couple shots, we saw a round, black, shiny object emerge from behind the trees,\" Officer Van Rensburg said. Then Smit, who had a reputation as an ex- cellent marksman, advanced to ppintblank range. At about 30 feet from the object he fired again. \"The eighth shot seemed to hit it, as a thud was heard,\" Smit said. \"As the UFO disappeared downwards I fired at the star ... and the object no longer changed colors once the star had been hit. It remained a mere darkish gun-metal body.\" As Smit moved closer a humming, machine-like noise was heard. The object, after four and a half hours in the area in bright sunlight, streaked away. The seven witnesses discovered nine strange depressions in the soil at the spot under which the object had hovered. Mrs. E. Verschoor of Fort Beaufort later examined the imprints and said, \"Thin but clear streaks running from one imprint to another look like pads and seem to indicate a slight sliding movement.\" Brigadier A. Vosloo, Police Eastern-Cape Divisional Commander, concluded the unknown object was definitely a \"controlled device.\" War- rent Officer Rensburg said, \"I did order Sergeant Kitching to shoot it ... with a .303 rifle belonging to Mr. Smit.\" When asked why he gave the order to shoot, he said, \"The matter is closed.\" The mayor of Fort Beaufort, an ex-policeman, backed the police action: \"They didn't use the right rifle. They should have used an FN rifle. I'm telling you, if the boys had brought that thing down, they'd be heros. I saw the thing dur- ing the day, and I can tell you it was no joke.\" \"Incredible, isn't it, that policemen and a farmer could have tried to shoot out of the sky in broad daylight what might have been a spacecraft from a friendly planet?\" asked the Durban Natal Mercury on the 28th. \"If it was a vehicle from outer space, manned by intelligent beings, do you suppose they now regard the inhabitants of Earth as hostile? Belligerent? Aggressive? Or just plain stupid?\" On July 9th, Mr. and Mrs. Smit were ordered by police not to give anymore information about the UFO or allow anyone on the farm. (The Star, Johannesburg, South Africa, 6/29/72; The Star, Auckland, New Zealand, 9/18/72; The Register, Santa Ana, CA, 1/3/73; Fate magazine, Sept. 1973) June 1977 • Mrs. Talmage DeWitt, of Lubbock, Texas, said her Irish setter jumped awake about 5 a.m. on the 24th, wak- ing her because of the sudden movement and the dog tags. \"The dog went to the bedroom door where she goes when she wants out and stood at attention without moving,\" Mrs. DeWitt said. \"When I first woke I could hear the sound of about a million crickets in all the trees here. But almost im- mediately, it was just deathly silent, not a sound. Then I could feel something as well as hear it, a pulsating, vibrating noise.\" She said she noticed a golden glow in the sky, got out of bed and went into the bathroom to look out the east window. \"Above the neighbor's house was this object,\" Mrs. DeWitt said. \"It was a long, narrow cigar-shaped object. Coming from underneath, above it and the ends was this glow, almost like rays. At the two ends, shooting up and down were long streaks of brilliant light and it was pulsating at the same rhythm I had been hearing.\" After watching for about three minutes the object moved away at a high rate of speed.

As many of you already know, I was recently operated upon for the removal of a kidney. The surgery was successful and I am recovering gradually, with no need for further medical pro- cedures other than periodic checkups. My prognosis is ex- cellent. During those difficult weeks my spirits were buoyed by the many flowers, cards, letters and thoughtful gifts I received, some even from people I have never met. I was deep- ly moved by these expressions of affection and support, and grateful for all that you have done for me. UFO research has sometimes been described as an arena filled with vicious, back-biting, hyper-competitive individuals, but so far as my experience goes, this description fits only a narrow minori- ty. In the 17 years I have worked within this field I have found a large and solid core of generous, mutually supportive in- dividuals at the center of our collective effort. I have noticed a particular attribute of this latter group. The UFO researchers who appear to be the least vituperative and the most intellectually tolerant of their colleagues are those who function most easily within a collective scientific at- mosphere. These individuals are constitutionally equipped to accept one another's contributions gratefully (and with grace), and from another perspective are able to reject one another's errors without sneering disdain. It is in the nature of UFO research, unfortunately, that a variety of helplessly narcissistic personalities, egoists, and others — some crippled by more than a touch of paranoia — are attracted to its mysteries. But again, and thankfully, these constitute only a minority. During my recent illness, some of those who were most supportive of me are colleagues who disagree with me in one area or another of our research — but they and I have nevertheless always been able to work smoothly together, with genuine mutual respect. The suppleness of mind essential to intellectual honestly would seem, then, to be intimately con- nected with the gift of simple human tolerance and compas- sion. The world of the contemptuous ideologue must be a cold and lonely place, indeed. The second reason for this letter has to do with my lecture at the upcoming Albuquerque MUFON symposium. I will be presenting what I believe to be the most important case for establishing the objective reality of UFO abductions that I <have yet encountered. It concerns the abduction, in November of 1989, of a woman from her twelfth floor apart- ment in New York City. The event was apparently witnessed by at least 14 independent observers, four of whom subse- quently contacted me. One of these witnesses is a major political figure, two others are security men who were trav- elling with him, and the fourth is a woman who happened to be driving across the Brooklyn Bridge while the abduc- tion was occurring. All four saw the UFO hovering above the apartment building, a bluish-white beam of light shining down from its underside, and watched the abductee, together with three aliens, floating in the light twelve stories above the street. During my talk I will play an audio cassette re- cording of the female abductee recalling the event in a hyp- notic trance state, as well as separate taped descriptions by two of the four witnesses. I will show photographic slides of the scene and sketches made by the female witness from her perspective on the Brooklyn Bridge, and I will also read excerpts from letters to me by the other witnesses. I am tak- ing the unusual step of describing the subject of my presen- tation in advance simply because of what I believe to be its extreme importance. Again, my deepest thanks for the support and affection you have shown me during a most difficult period in my life.

Webb July 1992 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Venus (magnitude -3.9) becomes visible very low in the WSW by month's end. At that time it sets only 40 minutes after the Sun. On July 31 the planet can be found 20° to the right of the slim lunar crescent. Jupiter (-1.8), in Leo, lies low in the W at dusk, setting about 10:30 PM in midmonth. The crescent Moon is nearby on the 4th. Saturn (0.3), in Capricornus, rises in the ESE about 9:30 PM in mid-July and about sunset at month's end. The giant world advances westward during the night. The gibbous Moon is nearby on July 16. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars (0.8), in Aries below the Pleiades, rises in the NE about 1:30 AM and is well up in the E at dawn. The lunar crescent forms a triangle with the ruddy planet and the Pleiades star cluster on the 25th. Saturn stands low in the SW at dawn. Meteor Shower: The South Delta, or July, Aquarids are at maximum without Moon interference on the morning of July 28. The rate then is about 20 meteors per hour. Look for medium-speed, yellowish streaks rushing away from Aquarius in the southern sky. Since Aquarius is above the horizon most of the night, some members of the shower are visible in the evening and also for about a month beginning in mid-July. • Moon Phases: First quarter — July 6 Full 'moon — July 14 Last quarter — July 22 New Moon — July 29 € O 3 The Stars: The Summer Triangle has ascended high in the SE after dark, while below it already appears the vanguard of the autumn constellations — the Great Square of Pegasus, Aquarius and Capricornus (with Saturn).

Miss Harris said she left work, in Pineville, North Carolina, about 11 p.m. on the eighth for her one mile walk home along N.C. 51. \"It was real quiet,\" she said. \"That's usually a very busy street, but there weren't any cars around.\" In the next instant, she said, \"I saw a weird object in the sky. It was very big, and it came right over me and stayed there for what seemed like 10 to 20 minutes, although I know it couldn't have been that long.\" The craft, which she estimated came within 300 feet of where she stood, was shaped kind of like a boomerang but more like a triangle. \"It really tripped me out,\" she said. \"I was afraid to look at it because of all the white lights.\" In the distance, a car approached. \"Then it (the UFO) just zipped away, just like that,\" Miss Harris said.

Anyone fascinated by the controversy surrounding the \"Face on Mars\" and other Martian enigmas will certainly want to obtain a new videotape of Richard Hoagland's United Nations presentation of February 27, 1992. HOAGLAND'S MARS: THE U.N. BRIEFING is a 93-minute tape which presents new information on the \"Monuments of Mars\" and terrestrial sites which seem to mirror the Martian landscape. Hoagland states that the geometry which he and others have found in the Martian formations is the same as that found in the \"crop circles\" which have appeared in England and other parts of the world. This is a fascinating and thought-provoking look at the Mars-Earth connection. The videotape is available from B.C. Video: 152 West 25th Street, New York, NY 10001-7401. The price is $29.95, plus $4.00 shipping/ handling.

Haines, Ph.D., Linda Moulton Howe, Bruce and Ann Morrison, Joseph Nyman, Robert \"Bob\" Pratt, Donald Schmitt and Kevin Randle, Dennis Stacy and Jacques Vallee, Ph.D. Three nominations were for a team of candidates. If they should be the award recipients, a single plaque will be awarded and the monetary prize of $500, made in the name of Dan C. Overlade, Ph.D., will be split between the awardees. A ballot was enclosed with the May 1992 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal so members/subscribers could cast one vote for the individual or team that you feel most warrants this prestigious recognition. All ballots must be returned to MUFON in Seguin, TX 78155 by June 27, 1992, so adequate time is available to engrave the plaque. If the membership is a family arrangement, each family member possessing a current MUFON I.D. card is entitled to one vote. The award plaque and monetary prize will be presented on July 12, 1992, at the MUFON 1992 International UFO Symposium in Albuquerque, New Mexico, or mailed to the awardee if he/she is not present to accept in person. National UFO Information Week Virginia M. Tilly, Director of Public Education, has an- nounced that MUFON's annual UFO Information Week is scheduled for August 9 through 16, 1992. In order to secure space at shopping malls, libraries, and public facilities, we have found that it is essential to make arrangements and re- servations now. Shopping malls, in particular, normally need six months advance notice to plan their advertising and sales promotions. Now is the time to start building your photo exhibit boards to be used in conjunction with UFO video programs on closed- circuit TV and a table to receive UFO sighting reports from the visitors to your exhibit.
