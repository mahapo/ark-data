' A~other probe, the Venus 6, was launched-some five days later and is scheduled to soft land on the ni&t side oft the planet. The'=nus 4 probe reached Venus on Oct. 18, 1967.. Considerable inf o-mat ion was' obtained fib? the planet atmos- phere. It was. learn'ed that the atmosphere c'onsisted mostly of carbon dioxide and registered teaperatures of 536. degrees Fahrenheit. The ' planet noves around the sun in 225 days and has a diameter of some 7,575 milcs. Through a. telescope V-enus appears as a tiny moon, going through the various ?bases as does our mom. Visually',' the planet appears as a yellow-ish-white in color; no surface details are visible; due to th-e cloud cover over the entire planet.
