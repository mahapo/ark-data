JANUARY 1983 ISSUE #213 FROM THE EDITOR .Should a;skeptic, even a self-described 'sympathetic' one, have access to the Journal's pages? Or should we carry only article's by bona fide, certified 'pro' ufologists? In answer to the last question, I think 'not, and for several reasons. One, it's too closely related to censorship, whether applied by me, or others, to suit my own editorial tastes. Two, it deprives the general reader of an often valid viewpoint and a source of relevant information to which they not otherwise be exposed. Third, we must by the very controversial nature of the phenomenon remain partly skeptical ourselves if we ever hope to lay.claim to objectivity and scientific responsibility. We. do, after all, despite the attitude of.the more vocal skeptics, debunk our \"own\" when necessary. An excellent example of same is a forthcoming article by Stan Gordon, Co-Director of the Pennsylvania Association for the Study of the Unexplained (PASU), and a MUFON State Director, on a recent NASA rocket release of high-altitude, glowing clouds of chemicals. They are now an identified aerial phenomena which might otherwise have spawned a , body of spurious reports within the field. •  \" ..

By John Schuessler BACKWARD LOOK In 1984 I took a critical look at UFOLOGY and presented the results in a paper entitled Estimate of the UFO Situation - 1984. My chief concerns were in the areas of methodology, ( human relations, and management. Some individuals were shocked by my observations and some were angry; but a significant number of people expressed similar opinions as mine. People were dropping out, leaving UFOLOGY, not because of lack of interest; but because they disliked the personal attacks and bickering they encountered. I classify these individuals as victims of non-professional behavior on behalf of their attackers. Unfortunately, this situation exists in all fields of science, not just UFOLOGY. UFO organizations were also feeling the pinch of rising costs, confounded by the loss of valuable supporters. Some of the groups chose to be the source of disunity and bickering, rather than cooperating. The North American UFO Federation was struggling to unify these groups and capitalize upon the power of cooperation. Management, or lack of management in many of the UFO organizations was beginning to show. Leaders had not selected and trained their successors, wants and desires of the membership were seldom heeded, and name recognition (CUFOS, Hynek, APRO, Lorenzen, MUFON, Andrus, etc.) was the main management tool used by all. CHANGES Many of the changes occurring since 1984 have had a negative impact on UFOLOGY. The fate of the North American UFO Federation is a good example. Led by Dr. Richard Haines, the federation had a good chance of success; but two key ingredients were John Schuessler -Dennis Stacy absent. Support from many organizations was lacking, and chief among the hold-outs was the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO). Without their moral and monetary support the federation could not achieve its goal of representing UFOLOGY as a whole. The second problem was within the federation itself. Some of the board members seemed to have a strong need for personal power at any cost. And the language used in some of their communications would make a sailor blush. Lack of professionalism killed what could have been the driver for success for all the member organizations. Dr. Haines exhibited the patience of a saint, while trying to prevent the collapse of the federation. He did all one man could do and I imagine he still believes strongly in the need for unity. The Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) is still in operation, but seems to have fallen on hard times as I predicted. Dr. J. Allen Hynek, the driving force behind CUFOS, left the Illinois-based group to form a research center in Arizona. CUFOS had been his dream and his quest for funded research was a valiant one. But without Dr. Hynek, or another strong science- based figure, CUFOS will face a continued struggle for survival. CUFOS has dropped publication of the CUFOS Associate Newsletter, another sign of hard times. Hopefully, the International UFO Reporter will continue. Some innovative manage- ment ideas on the part of John Timmerman and the others is necessary at this point in time. This may be difficult for him, when even the (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"SITUATION, Continued editor of IUR is critical of the work of the founder, Dr. Hynek. Hard times continue at APRO. The failure to select and train future leaders had significant impact. During 1985 the APRO Bulletin ceased publication. The failing health of Coral and Jim Lorenzen is cited as the reason for the demise of this fine publication. We will all miss APRO as a partner in the work ahead. MUFON As I watched APRO, SBI and many of the smaller groups fade from the scene, I .expressed concern for the MUTUAL UFO NETWORK (MU- FON). In 1984 I noted the attempt by a few key members of the organization to control the thoughts, words, and deeds of all MUFON members. They wanted the power to specify the outcome of every action — to control the International Director Walter Andrus and everyone below him. This was counter to the grass roots foundation of the organization and was costing dearly in terms of membership and work output. A situation similar to the one existing in APRO that caused the formation of MUFON in the first place could have caused severe damage to MUFON. Walt Andrus could have taken offense at my 1984 estimate and ignored it. The opposite is true. Walt listened to the inputs from the grass roots of MUFON, watched the failures of other organizations, and remained open to suggestions for improvement. He exhibited very strong leadership during this period, in spite of his detractors, and kept MUFON in operation. When Walt received a petition from several members and non- members suggesting changes in the way business is done, cooperation is accomplished, and funds are raised, he accepted it as a starting point for change. He examined every point and started a dialogue with the author of the petition — Marge Christensen. Good things will result from this interchange. Walt always uses good management style in his approach to problem solving. He solicits . the participation of the Board members and values their input. He realizes the importance of recognizing the accomplishments of all the members and he works diligently to know and understand their needs and feelings. He readily shares the limelight with all the other hard workers in MUFON, clearly emphasizing the importance of the- team and each individual on the team. This teamwork extends beyond MUFON, as Walt has been the chief supporter of cooperation between MUFON and CUFOS and in the creation of the North American UFO Federation. And when the detractors 'attack MUFON, Walt is not afraid to fight back. Recognizing the need for public education and the importance of the media, Walt Andrus has supported the work of Marge Christensen, the National Public Relations Director for MUFON. Marge has become a significant figure in UFOLOGY through her efforts in the public relations arena. She has been pushing each of the MUFON leaders at the state level to organize and to communicate with members and the media alike. On a larger scale Marge has been instrumental in organizing a UFO Information Week on behalf of MUFON and CUFOS and has worked with the other active members of the Mass. MUFON group to sponsor an annual UFO Forum, that rivals most symposia. Strangely enough, this effort has also been attacked by the CUFOS editor. Maybe Marge should adopt a slogan saying \"become a part of the solution, not a part of the problem.\" MEDIA The media is a problem for UFOLOGY today. The tabloid press continues to print questionable, even ridiculous UFO stories, while the major book publishers shy away from UFO related manuscripts. Magazines fail to carry UFO stories, journals avoid UFO research, and the specialty publications have ceased to exist. The only worthwhile source of UFO information is the few journals produced by the remaining UFO organizations. It will take a major flap to change the direction of this trend and move away from a complete elimination of UFOs in the major media. As we begin 1986, it appears that MUFON will survive and prosper. CUFOS is at a turning point, but has some good talent which will carry it through the rough spots. Many of the other organizations in the United States will become history. Their contributions will be missed. PRESCRIPTION All of the current UFO organizations depend upon volunteers to survive. These volunteers do the work and pay the bills. Therefore, something must be done to assure a continued stable, even growing volunteer workforce. UFO organizations must compete for the services of these people. Never in history has there been such a demand for volunteers. This means the task of volunteer management must take on new dimensions. The manager of volunteers must recognize the importance of being participative. When people participate in a venture they will support it. The day of \"I'm the boss, you are the worker\" is gone. The manager must feel the needs of the volunteers and become an expert in human relations. At the same time the need for planning, long and short range, is mandatory. People need to see where the organization is headed and become a part of taking it there. And last but not least, ethical behavior on the part of every individual is necessary. The result will be a successful and respected organization. This simple prescription for success is based upon what many profit-making companies are doing to meet the challenges of this age. Volunteer organizations must do the same thing or fail. Consider why people do not volunteer. It is not enough to offer membership in the organization. While an individual may be interested in UFOs, he or she may be held back by any one of a number of things. Some of the blockades to volunteerism are as follows: • Fear of getting in \"over their (continued on page 18)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"THE McDIVITT SIGHTING By James Oberg Of the dozens of reports associating astronauts with UFO encounters and photographs, undoubtedly the best was the June 4, 1965 sighting reported by Major James McDivitt, command pilot of the two- man Gemini-4. His testimony baffled even the super-skeptical Condon Committee in 1969; a photograph from his flight has been widely published and hailed as one of the \"best UFO photos ever made.\" Yet McDivitt himself has never made much of his sighting, however often he has politely retold the tale to fascinated audiences and interviewers. He remains of the mind that he saw some unidentified but still man-made piece of orbital debris. There is no evidence anybody in US government agencies took 'the slightest official notice, nor is there any record that the astronaut ever filed a UFO report with Project Blue Book — which he, as an active duty Air Force officer, was obligated to do if he really thought he had seen a \"true UFO.\" NASA has always insisted — and this view has since been supported by my research — that there was nothing at all mysterious about the encounter and that the object was clearly terrestrial in origin (Soviet or American). McDivitt's own booster rocket has been tagged as the culprit in some studies. The famous photograph, meanwhile, has been dismissed by McDivitt himself and by other investigators as having no connection with the actual sighting, but as showing instead only one of many miscellaneous blobs of light which abounded in the actual flight film (the photo has, because of its tailed oval form, been dubbed the \"tadpole\"). GEMINI-4 The facts are plain. On June 3, 1985, Gemini-4 was launched into orbit one hundred fifty miles above the Earth's surface. Rookie astronauts McDivitt and White were headed for the USA's first long-duration flight, the first to attempt extensive visual observations and photography. On the second day, over Hawaii, the 35-year old McDivitt reported seeing an object — \"like a beercan with an arm sticking out\" — which NASA offisials later announced had been identified by Air Force space radars as the thousand- mile-distant Pegasus-2 (but that range was too great, it turned out, for McDivitt's object to have been the winged Pegasus satellite). Twice later, other lights were seen in the sky. Together with a mysterious \"tadpole\" photo, the McDivitt report has achieved UFO superstardom and has been firmly enshrined in UFO literature and lore. A poll of active UFO enthusiasts attending a convention in 1983 demonstrated that the McDivitt case still held great authority. A clear majority deemed it a \"true UFO.\" McDivitt himself described his encounter many times. He summarized it in the following way on the Dick Cavett Show in November 1973 (as reported in FATE magazine, June 1974): \"I was flying with Ed White. He was sleeping at the time so I don't have anybody to verify my story. We were drifting in space with the control engines shut down and all the instrumentation off (when) suddenly (an object) appeared in the window. It had a very definite shape — a cylindrical object — it was white — it had a long arm that stuck out on the side. I don't know whether it was a very small object up close or a very large object a long ways away. There was nothing to judge by. I really don't know how big it was. We had two cameras that were just floating in the spacecraft at the time, so I grabbed one and took a picture of (the object) and grabbed the other and took a picture. Then I turned on the rocket control systems because I was afraid we might hit it. At the time we were drifting — without checking I have no idea which way we were going\" — but as we drifted up a little farther, the sun shown on the window of the spacecraft. The windshield was dirty — just like an automobile, you can't see through it. So I had the rocket control engines going again and moved the spacecraft so that the window was in darkness again — the object was gone. I called down later and told them what had happened and they went back and checked their records of other space debris that was flying around but we were never able to identify what it could have been. The film was sent back to NASA and reviewed by some NASA film technicians. One of them selected what he thought was what we talked about, at least before I had a chance to review it. It was not the picture — it was a picture of the sun reflection on the window.\" CONDON REPORT A good place to start a careful re- examination of the case is with the \"professional skeptics\" who were themselves stumped by the report — and had the honesty to say so. In 1968, the Air Force seemed anxious to wash its hands of the UFO business and find justification for closing down 'Project Blue Book,' its widely-criticized small- scale investigative effort. The University of Colorado was contracted to make a study of the whole UFO phenomenon under the direction of Professor Edward U. Condon. Most UFOlogists regard the 'Condon Report' as a whitewash of the Air Force's role and as a deliberate attempt to slant evidence to fit a preconceived conclusion. Yet the Condon Committee endorsed the mystery of the McDivitt UFO sighting! Space scientist Dr. Franklin Roach (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"McDIVITT, Continued was the committee's specialist on the astronaut cases. He found \"visual sightings made by the astronauts while in orbit which, in the judgment of the writer (Roach), have not been adequately explained.... Unexplained sightings which have been gleaned from a great mass of reports are a challenge to the analyst. Especially puzzling is (McDivitt's sighting) of an object showing details such as arms protruding from a body having a noticeable angular extension. If the NORAD (Air Force) listing of objects near the GT-4 spacecraft at the time of the sighting is complete, as it presumably is, we shall have to find a rational explanation or, alternatively, keep it on our list of unidentifieds.\" Those were his words: \"a challenge to the analyst.\" This conclusion is typical of the power of 'astronaut UFO sightings.' Here is one such UFO case certified by the \"anti-UFO\" Condon Committee, supposedly commissioned by the U.S. Air Force to do all it could to debunk the UFO phenomenon. Needless to say, this endorsement was received with tremendous enthusiasm and little criticism or further research on the part of UFOlogists. But since 1969, when the Condon report was published, some new resources have become available concerning McDivitt's UFO. Furthermore, Dr. Roach himself had put his finger on the key to his logically compelled endorsement of the McDivitt case, with the stated assumption: \"i/ the NORAD listing...is complete.\" MANEUVERS One of the primary early objectives of the Gemini-4 flight was to practice orbital rendezvous operations with the cast-off Titan-II second stage. The Gemini thrusted forward off the booster as soon as they reached orbit, but the astronauts quickly turned their capsule around and attempted to null out the velocity differences and make a return to the spent rocket stage. This attempt was soon terminated after the crew had used up a large fraction of their capsule's maneuvering fuel. However, the two objects (the spacecraft and the booster), were by that time in close parallel orbits, swinging first apart and then back together again in the course of each 90- minute revolution around the Earth. The attempt to rendezvous with the 27-foot-long, ten-foot-diameter, 6,000-pound stage highlighted difficulties in judging distances in space. McDivitt complained about not having proper equipment for judging range and range rate to a target; he was unable to do so by eyeball alone: \"I think that you can't tell distances from a single light,\" he concluded, proposing additional running lights for rendezvous targets on subsequent flights. NASA experts concurred; they later estimated that McDivitt was consistenly reporting he was five times closer to the stage than he really was — possibly because of his excellent eyesight and his inexperience with visual targets of that shape and size. But that was one of the main purposes of the flight: determine an astronaut's ability to 'eyeball' other objects in space, and specify the kinds of equipment to be needed to do the job right. The booster did not fall out of orbit and burn up for at least 50 hours, according to tracking data later released by NORAD via the Goddard Space Flight Center. During that time, it was close to the Gemini and then gradually pulled ahead of it on its decaying orbit. Now, this put it well within the thousand-mile range specified by NORAD for nearby satellites at the time for the UFO sighting, yet it was not on that list released by NORAD. Why not? A reasonable hypothesis is that NASA had only asked about all other space objects, not specifying any debris associated with Gemini itself. The NORAD computers would produce reports for only satellites launched before Gemini-4, ignoring any objects launched along with it. Alternately, NORAD might not even have had accurate data on the booster, since most of its radars were in northern regions optimal for spotting Soviet space vehicles but beyond the range of American manned spacecraft. In 1965, NORAD had only one radar site which could have tracked satellites in the Gemini orbit. As a policy, NORAD was sometimes under instructions not to \"paint\" manned spacecraft with high- powered radar beams, so as not to risk interference with on-board electronic equipment. An inquiry to the NORAD Directorate of Public Affairs did not' produce a definitive solution. \"Your comments on the NORAD role related to (Gemini-4) appear to be logical,\" replied NORAD Public Information Officer Del W. Kindschi. \"But our space people tell me they no longer have copies of the messages that were sent to NASA Houston on the sightings,\" Kindschi added. EYEWITNESS McDivitt's testimony has drifted somewhat from the precise facts of this aspect of the case. The false impression has been given by some writers that the Gemini-4 was being tracked on radar at the time of the sighting, and nothing showed up on the radarscopes at that very moment. McDivitt's own words on this, during an interview broadcast on the 1977 UFO documentary \"Mysteries From Beyond Earth,\" are as follows: \"We were....never able to identify what it was and all of our ground radar tracking data indicated that there shouldn't have been another object anywhere near us at the time.\" The encounter occurred out of range of ground tracking sites, and only computerized extrapolations of known orbiting objects were able to provide any insight into what might have been close - as long as all candidate orbits would have been considered, and we have seen that all such objects were not considered. How did McDivitt describe the UFO? His first brief report came in at Mission Elapsed Time (MET) 29 hours 52 minutes 17 seconds. Five minutes later he described it better. \"It had big arms sticking out of it, it looked like. I only had it for a minute...\" On June 6 - while the flight was still in progress - ABC television science editor Jules Bergman reported that the UFO was really a secret U.S. military (confirmed next page)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"McDIVITT, Continued reconnaissance satellite. Bergman continued that space officials had been unable to identify it because the DOD refused to admit the existence of such a satellite — and presumably thus draw attention to it. But that story is implausible at best and — to my knowledge — has never been repeated. And it is just not consistent with what can be deduced about the UFO's motion relative to the Gemini — it would have flown past much too quickly. At a news conference on June 11, McDivitt gave more details about the object: \"Near Hawaii...I saw a white object and it looked like it was cylindrical and it looked to me like there was a white arm sticking out of it...It looked a lot like an upper stage of a booster.\" The astronaut gave few additional details when interviewed by Dr. Roach of the Condon Committee in 1968: \"McDivitt saw a cylindrical- shaped object with an antennalike extension,\" Roach reported. \"The appearance was something like the second phase (sic) of a Titan...It is McDivitt's opinion that the object was probably some unmanned satellite.\" As the years passed, McDivitt became something of a celebrity to UFO groups with his short, modest story of a space UFO. After his retirement from NASA and the Air Force in 1971, he often recalled the event on television talk shows, radio interviews, and even on a special long- playing UFO record. For example, on the NBC TV show \"The Unexplained,\" subtitled The UFO Connection' (Feb. 21, 1976), McDivitt related that \"I just happened to look out the window and there in front of me was an object which was cylindrical in shape and had a pole sticking out there. It would be about the same relative shape as a beer can with a pencil sticking out one corner of it.\" Speaking to Houston Post space reporter Jim Maloney late in 1975, McDivitt gave new details: \"I never made a big deal out of it. It was something I definitely couldn't identify. I reported it to the ground.... Ed was asleep and we were rotating at a pretty high rate in drifting flight. The windows were dirty, I recall... All of a sudden there was this white object out there. It looked like a beer can with a pencil sticking out of it at an angle.\" Maloney adds that the astronaut estimated that he got a 30-second look at the object. Furthermore, McDivitt said, the space agency made no attempt to prevent his telling his UFO story. The Air Force wasn't interested, either: as far as can be determined, McDivitt never even filed a UFO report with Project Blue Book. NASA did not bother with the story, it seems, because nobody was particularly puzzled by the object. When queried by Congressman Robert. Michel (himself queried by a constituent), NASA Assistant Administrator for Legislative Affairs Richard L. Callaghan replied that \"We believe it to be a rocket tank or spent second stage of a rocket.\" BOOSTER Thus, the mystery object looked just like a second stage of a rocket, even (in McDivitt's own words) a lot like the second stage of a Titan-II. So then, why didn't McDivitt think it was his own booster rocket? Could he have really seen his own booster and not recognized it? The glare and contrasts of space can trick even an astronaut's eyesight, as illustrated by this sequence from the Gemini-4 voice tapes. Astronaut Edward White (whose eyesight was even better than McDivitt's) has just spotted something out the window: \"We've got an object out in front of us. It's not flashing like it's the booster. It appears that it's that type of an object unless it's picking up some glow from the sun. It appears a very bright, very bright object.... (30 second pause)... It was the booster. I can see the light flashing on it now...Just as it goes into darkness, the relfection of the sun on the booster causes a very bright image. That's the object I had seen earlier.\" During Gemini-4's close maneuvers around the Titan-II upper stage, one of the astronauts made several shots with a movie camera. A still photograph from this sequence was later released by the NASA HQ Public Affairs Office and was widely distributed. It showed a beer can- shaped cylinder floating in space above a cloudy horizon. During an 1975 interview between Mr. Philip Klass of Aviation Week and Space Technology magazine and Colonel Bernard Szczutkowski of NORAD, Klass mentioned his interest in investigating and solving UFO cases. Szczutkowski reached into his desk, pulled out an 8x10 photo, and asked Klass, \"Do you want to see' a photo of McDivitt's UFO?\" Klass quickly assented. The USAF officer handed Klass the PAO print of the Titan-II second stage, floating above Earth's distant horizon. This, he told Klass, was what McDivitt had seen but had been unable to identify. It was his own Titan booster. Subsequently, Klass obtained a copy of the photo from NORAD and sent it to McDivitt, asking if it did not in fact closely correspond to the verbal description of the UFO on the space flight. McDivitt replied, \"Thank you for sending me the slide of the Gemini IV photograph. I very quickly identified the object in the photograph as the 2nd stage of the Titan rocket which launched us....I am sure that this is not a photograph of the object which I described many times and which many people refer to as the Gemini IV UFO...\" So he was (and still is) certain his UFO had not been the second stage. The reasons which McDivitt gave for this certainty, however, were very interesting. • It was not because the objects were shaped differently at all. Instead, McDivitt explained, \"At the time I saw whatever that object was the background was nothing but the black of space. There was not a horizon anywhere within my view.\" But that field of view was only about 25 degrees across, showing less than 3% of the celestial sphere. The .horizon could have been right past the edge of the window and still have been quite close to the UFO, without McDivitt know it. In addition, McDivitt's reply to my preliminary identification (in 1976) of his UFO with the Titan-II second stage was equally explicit: \"The reason I did not assume that the object I saw was the (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"McDIVITT, Continued upper stage of the Titan-II was simple. During the first orbit of our mission, my job was to fly formation with the upper stage of the rocket. This I attempted to do and I spent approximately l l / 2 to 2 hours looking at this upper stage from various angles and distances, and was quite familiar with its appearance. The object I saw later was indeed not the upper stage of the Titan-II used in Gemini IV. It may have been a lot of other things, but it definitely was not that upper stage.\" Keeping in mind that astronaut White, who had spent the same period watching the same booster, had already misidentified it at least once at a much closer range, let us take another look at the visual conditions under which McDivitt saw the object and consider if he might have made a similar mistake. The smudged windows (White tried to wipe them clean during his spacewalk the day before, but only made them worse — \"You smeared my windshield, you dirty dog,\" McDivitt had joked at the time) can certainly be a hindrance for visual identification of objects. Moreover, McDivitt was looking toward an extremely intense light source: \"My small end was up above the horizon so I couldn't see the horizon. As it came around towards the sun, I saw the — this other satellite, but then as the sun came in through the window I lost it because the sun was so bright.\" Mission Control asked for clarification, repeating, \"Roger. You were looking into the sun, then, when you saw it?\" McDivitt's reply was a single short phrase: \"That's affirmative.\" Was there anything else which might have affected the acuity of McDivitt's eyesight during this part of the flight, so that he would be observing the booster under viewing conditions significantly different from those of the first few hours of the mission? Indeed there was. A space magazine reported two items of interest: \"The 100% oxygen atmosphere created some red eyes during the first day or so of the flight...\" Furthermore, \"Operation of the waste collection systems was (sic) generally satisfactory, except for leakage of urine into the cabin... 8 McDivitt at one point told the ground that 'I thought those fumes around 24 hours were bad. You ought to be up here now!' \" The pure oxygen irritated the astronauts' eyes after a day or so of exposure, and a subsequent mechanical failure made it worse. The spacecraft's breathing-oxygen tank (located in the unpressurized aft end of the vehicle) overheated and threatened to pop its pressure relief valve, so Mission Control engineers decided to vent the excess pressure through the cabin rather than risk the fan's unreachable valve from sticking open and draining everything. This decision was made because the relief valve in the cabin could be manually closed by the astronauts in case of mechanical failure. To allow this procedure, the cabin air pressure had to rise to six pounds per sqare inch, significantly higher than the normal level which had already proved irritating to the crew's eyes. This buildup was initiated at Mission Elapsed Time 28% hours — about an hour before McDivitt reported sighting his UFO. EYESIGHT Two months after the flight, a NASA spokesman announced the decision to eliminate another eye irritant. \"A blotting material to absorb excess moisture, which might have caused the eye and nose irritation of astronauts Edward White and James McDivitt during the June 3 GEMINI IV flight had been eliminated from the GEMINI V spacecraft,\" reported the Houston Chronicle. Did a combination of these three items really bother McDivitt and possibly adversely affect his eyesight? The following extremely revealing conversation took place after three days in space (at about Mission Elapsed time 72 hours 43 minutes). Houston: Jim, the Flight Surgeon wonders if he can say anything about your eyes. Have you had jny problems? Any drying or anything at all? McDivitt: Yes. Listen, I had a lot of trouble with my eyes at the end of the first day. I wasn't sure I was going to be able to hack it. But they have cleared up now... Houston: Okay, You don't have any problem at all now with them? McDivitt: No problem at all. Though it was really bad between about 18 hours and 36 hours. As these same transcripts showed earlier, the UFO was reported at 29 hours 52 minutes, right in the middle of the period McDivitt judged his eyes \"really bad.\" It is clear that his eyesight was severely degraded at that time. ELAPSED TIME During the thirty seconds or so that McDivitt had the object in sight, was he staring at it trying to identify it? Evidently not, and for good reasons. He was instead grabbing for two different cameras and exposing a few frames from each. The actual time he was watching the object cannot have been more than a few seconds. One other important subjective impression McDivitt got was the object could have been on a collision course with the Gemini. This conclusion comes instinctively to a pilot when an object maintains a constant 'angle off,' not changing its relative position in his field of view. If the object crosses the field of view with any speed, it will not collide. Yet McDivitt recalled: \"I was concerned that it was going to run into me.\" Roach interpreted further: \"The reaction of the astronaut was that it might be necessary to take action to avoid collision.\" Any pilot in the midst of a potential mid-air collision is not going to pay much attention to the license number of the incoming object. Yet because of the high speeds of orbital flight, any satellite in a different orbit would have streaked by McDivitt's eyes in a matter of seconds, as was seen by other Gemini astronauts on other flights. On Gemini- II, for example, a near miss (less than ten miles) with another satellite was seen by astronauts Conrad and Gordon, who never once suspected that a collision was imminent during that very brief encounter. The conclusion is that the object must have been in parallel orbit with the Gemini.

The KSL-TV science editor was also included on the show for \"balance.\" He pointed out that two scientists, Dr. John Derr of Golden, Colorado, and Dr. Michael Persinger of Laurentian University, Ontario, have suggested that at least some of the 1965-71 sightings in the Basin could have been caused by underground shifts in pressure, because a cluster of mini-earthquakes seem to have coincided with lights seen in the sky. EARTHLIGHTS Dr. Brian Brady demonstrated in a laboratory at the U.S. Bureau of Mines in Denver how rocks can explode under pressure, giving off a flash of light that can be recorded on film in a dark room. This was interesting and informative, but as Dr. Brady conceded, it does not explain daylight sightings. However, the opening and the closing interviews were with, respectively, science teacher Hicks and Dr. Frank Salisbury, the plant biologist at Utah State University at Logan, who wrote The Utah UFO Display (Devin Adair, 1974). The book was based primarily on Hick's research into UFO sightings in the late sixties. He showed the three UFO models he has built based on the three most commonly described types seen in the area. WITHDRAWN Dr. Salisbury has withdrawn from UFO research in recent years for personal reasons, and in his interview with host Bruce Lindsay seemed to be anxious not to get too far out on a limb while still being perfectly honest. Asked, \"Do you as a scientist believe in UFOs?\" Salisbury fudged his answer. But asked whether he thought the earthquake lights theory could explain the Utah sightings, he replied honestly, \"They couldn't account for a large metal object seen fifty feet away.\" Asked if the witnesses were credible, he edged out on his limb bit by bit. \"Credible? What's credible? One UFO was seen by a Mormon bishop. Is he credible? If you mean were they seen just by the town drunk, the answer is no. They were seen by outstanding members of the community.\" Junior Hicks called me from Roosevelt to tell me to watch the show. I have it on video. I asked him if there had been any recent sightings. Two, he said, one of a bright light over a ditch and one of a large boomerang-shaped object crossing the sky. Until I know more about it I may give the bright light to the geologists, but the boomerang?

It had the right shape, the right orbit, was in the right place at the right time — and if after all that McDivitt still didn't recognize it at a glance, there were ample physiological reasons and possible precedents as well. OTHER UFOS? McDivitt saw two other \"UFOs\" on the flight, neither of them in any way different, in appearance from ordinary man-made satellites. At a press conference in Houston, he described them this way: \"We saw another one at night. It looked like just a pinpoint of light in the sky.... And I saw another one over the Western Pacific again just shortly before I got into the sunlight on the windshield... The only one I could even define the shape of at all was the first one...\" These sightings are in no way remarkable, except in how they can be rewritten (one author reported that the shape of McDivitt's third UFO \"defied description\" — a slight twist of what the astronauts had originally meant!).

Walton Beach, FL, 30 block, Woodham Rd. Local Evaluation: Ordinary unknown sighting On 20 August 1985, Teresa Hand, a 31-year old school teacher in Pensacola, FL, called to tell me about a 1973 UFO sighting. She got my phone number from an article about MUFON in the 19 August Pensacola News Journal. She reported a glowing, yellow/white, oval object about the size of a compact car about 70 feet away that caused a strange odor. During an interview in her home on 3 Sep 85, she made the following statement. \"I was at a party with my boyfriend when I noticed a very strange odor (the windows were open). This odor was different from anything I had ever smelled, and I was quite frightened by it. My verbal remarks were, This doesn't belong here — it doesn't belong to our time.' I really was frightened and began searching the house with others for the source. \"My boyfriend and I looked out the front window and observed the object moving smoothly above the power lines (phone and 110 v.). I was awe-struck and knew immediately that I was witnessing a UFO. During the sighting I was completely mesmerized. I was unable to take my eyes off the object. My fear turned to awe. \"As it moved from view my boyfriend and I sat motionless for about one minute trying to grasp what we had witnessed. Reassuring each other that we had both witnessed the same thing, we then tried to tell others. But they laughed, so we ventured out on out own. The smell had decreased in intensity, and the object was no longer . visible. There was also a mist which seemed to clear as the object left (first seen through the window). This may 12 have been purely a weather related coincidence (it was clear and 65 to 70°F when they arrived at the party). \"The object was beautiful. It was about 11 feet long and 5 feet wide. It made no sound and glided gently (about 2 feet) over the power lines (in the front yard, north to south). At one point it paused a few seconds and then resumed movement.\" It was in view through the window for about 20 seconds. At the time of the sighting, Teresa was 19 years old and single. She has had little experience in chemistry classes, and has still not identified the strong odor. She had not been using alcohol or drugs. She said she had no particular interest in UFOs; however, in 1971 her parents showed her about 10 distant night lights dancing in the sky that they could not identify. She lost contact with the others at the party when she married and moved to Pensacola, so the other witness was not located. The sighting location was checked, and it appears as she described it. I think this is a true account of an object so close it could not be a plane, natural phenomenon, or hoax. This unknown object is considered an ordinary CE-1 that caused a mist and strange odor. -Donald Ware Date: May or June 1968 Time: 2:00 am MST Location: Interstate Highway 10 in New Mexico (Railroad tracks ran parallel to I.H. 10 on the north side) Witnesses: (1) Revard N. Vordenbaum Sari Antonio, Texas (2) Diane Vordenbaum (wife) Mr. Vordenbaum had recently been discharged from the U.S. Marine Corp. He and his wife, Diane, were driving from San Clemente, Calif, to San Antonio, Texas. Revard was driving a 1965 Grand Sport Buick (similar to a Buick Skylark). Diane observed a light (oval shape) traveling east parallel to the witnesses, approximately 100 yards north of the railroad tracks, and pointed it out to her husband. The witnesses were driving 65 m.p.h. The lighted object was traveling a little less than 65 m.p.h., since it was gradually dropping behind. The light was described as \"not large, but not small.\" After flying parallel and pacing their car for about two minutes, the light made a distinct 90 degree turn and ascended straight up. It disappeared within 1 to 2 seconds. Diane was leaning over the back seat to watch it ascend, since it was no longer visible to the driver through the left front window. Revard volunteered the following information when he was questioned during the interview: There were other cars proceeding east with them on I.H. 10 but none passed them traveling west at the time of the sighting. The driver's window (left front) was open, but no sound was heard. He doesn't remember if the radio was turned on, but it probably was not due to the poor reception of both AM and FM radio stations in that area and the hour (2 a.m.). The engine functioned perfectly. They stopped at the next town, checked into a motel and stayed overnight. He does not remember the name of the town. When he was asked if there was a mountain range or hills along the north side of I.H. 10 in the area of the sightings, he said he was unable to observe any due to the darkness. One of the witnesses is a businessman in San Antonio and was exhibiting his merchandise and products at the Guadalupe County Fair.

Linda Nesloney and Bessie Swinnea were driving west on State Highway 202 toward Beeville, Texas (Mrs. Swinnea was the driver). They were about seven miles east of Chase Field N.A.S., but could not see the obstruction lights around the field (flat terrain). A rotating ball of light that looked like aluminum metal, having a disc or saucer shape descended directly in front of their automobile. It was an extremely bright light. They were driving 55 m.p.h. prior to the sighting. The object was slightly above the windshield level. The diameter of the object was wider than the hood of the car and was only 12 feet ahead of them at the closest point. Mrs. Swinnea slowed their automobile because she throught she might hit the object, since it was so close. After pacing their car for about a minute, the object ascended and passed directly over their automobile. Both Linda and her mother turned to see where it had gone, but didn't see it again. Their radio was not turned on and the engine was not affected. They heard no sound associated with the object. The object was above the headlight high beams of their car, appeared saucer-shaped and looked like polished aluminum.

With her were her daughter of about 2 years and her mother. It was nearly dusk with the car lights not yet on, when they suddenly noticed a UFO hovering a foot or two above the field ahead and about 50 feet to the right of the road. It was about the size of a \"small house,\" and the tall grass directly underneath was observed to ripple or undulate unnaturally. When almost abreast of it, it.started to rise, slowly at first and then faster. It then simply vanished, too quickly to have disappeared in the distance. She said this fact had bothered her ever since. She was quite.relieved to hear that a considerable fraction of UFOs are reported to terminate their appearance in that manner, as she had done no reading up on UFOs. LIGHTS & SOUNDS From her remembrance of the grass or grain, she feels that the occurrence was probably in late spring or early summer. She said the UFO had a saucer shape and a metallic appearance, and vaguely remembers noticing red lights around its rim. She also remembers a humming noise associated with it. The total sighting lasted only a couple of minutes. The car's ignition was not affected by it. Both Lois and her mother were not frightened by the object, and Lois remembers their feelings of not wanting it to leave. There were no houses nearby and no other cars around at the time, and she knows of no other witnesses to the event. When they reached their farmhouse to which they had been driving and told Lois' father, a minister, about it, he became rather upset and asked that they not talk about it to others. So they made no report to anyone connected with investigation of UFOs until mid 1985. Only recently did Lois learn that her mother had had another UFO sighting a few years after the first one. However, her mother does not now remember much of the details of it, and tends to get the two sightings confused according to Lois. -Jim Deardorff SAY YES TO MICHIGAN 17TH ANNUAL UFO SYMPOSIUM JUNE 27-29 1986 KELLOGG CENTER FOR CONTINUING EDUCATION MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY PRESENTED BY MUTUAL UFO NETWORK 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"DELPHOS REVISITED: PART II By Walt Andrus INTRODUCTION , Part I of a series of articles to be titled \"Delphos Revisited\" was published in the September 1985 issue, number 209, of the MUFON UFO JOURNAL under the heading \"Delphos, Kansas Case\" by Ted Phillips. Some very .unusual reproductive events subsequently occurred to the sheep after the November 2, 1971 near-landing of a UFO alongside a sheep shed (barn). This information has been reconstructed from records maintained by Ronnie Johnson, age 16, of his Future Farmers of America (F.F.A.) sheep-raising project by the author. This material is being published for the first time so that it may become an integral part of this case. It will also give knowledgeable people/an opportunity to be exposed to the possible animal medical reproductive- ! effects of exposure in close proximity to a UFO. This report may be considered a sensitive and controversial subject; however, it might also provide essential clues to radiation effects upon animals such as sheep. We hope that trained people in the field of veterinary medicine, radiology, biology, etc. are able to provide answers. BACKGROUND Ronnie Johnson (age 16), a member of the F.F.A. (Future Farmers of America), had as his project raising sheep. This report is a follow-up on the UFO sighting report, of November 2, 1971, when at approximately 7:00 p.m. a brightly glowing object hovered in the muddy sheep lot while Ronnie was securing his sheep for the night. After hovering 'one or two feet above the ground, Ronnie observed the object take off at an angle directly over the sheep shed alongside which, he and his dog \"Snowball\" were standing. Ronnie was temporarily blinded by the bright 14 Ronnie Johnson and his dog Snowball at the landing site (1971) -MUFON light for about ten minutes, whereas the dog continued to bump into objects on the following day. This report will be confined to the unusual events surrounding the reproduction of sheep and lambs after the November 2, 1971 sighting. When Larry Moyers, Former State Director, of Akron, Ohio visited the Johnson family on August 1, 1972, he was told that several of Ronnie's six-month old lambs had produced offspring earlier than normal for sheep. The gestation period for a ewe is normally 147 days, or nearly five (5) months. Since each of the premature lambs was either stillborn or died one day after birth, Ronnie decided to sell all 20 of the fattened lambs in this age bracket for slaughter. Larry Moyars reported this fact to both Ted Phillips in Sedalia, Mo., a few days later and to Walt Andrus in Quincy, 111. When it was learned that the lambs displaying the very unusual reproductive characteristics were sold to the Standard Stockyard in Wichita, Kansas, on August 2, 1972, the possibility of submitting these lambs to a school of .veterinary medicine for research purposes was eliminated. Knowing that members of the Future Farmers of America quite often maintain very detailed accounts and records of their projects, Walt Andrus contacted the Durel Johnson family on September 21, 1972 by telephone to determine if Ronnie Johnson had facts and figures concerning the birth dates of the lambs which had produced lambs of their own. CHRONOLOGY The major concern in this case is whether the,UFO landing in the sheep lot on November 2, 1971 could in any way be related to the unusual birth records of these lambs. After talking to Durel, Erma, and Ronnie Johnson, and (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"DELPHOS, Continued referring to the records maintained by Ronnie on his sheep project, the following facts have been reconstruct- ed in a somewhat chronological order: (See Table)  ' The remaining twenty-four or twenty-three lambs were placed in a separately fenced feed lot during the Spring of 1972 to be fattened for market. Three of these lambs born sometime between October 1,1971 and late in November 1971 delivered lambs of their own, the first arriving June 12, 1972. Two of the lambs were not fully developed and were stillborn. The third was the size of a large cat and was fully developed with respect to wool, hoofs, etc. However, this lamb died after one day even though it was normal in every respect, except that it was small. The Johnson's did not consider this unusual, even though the mothers weighed only 50 pounds. The irregular, births occurred to only three of the 23 or 24 lambs that were being fattened. So that as many facts are available as possible, it must be explained that the sheep lot or enclosure used for fattening of the lambs is separated from the lot containing the two rams and the twenty-two adult ewes by a double fence separated sufficiently so that a pickup truck may be driven between the two fences in order to feed the sheep and lambs on either side. The adult rams were confined to their own lot or pen and had no access to the lambs in the adjoining fenced area. Ronnie had no records identifying the number of male and female lambs that were being \"fed out.\" This may or may not be pertinent, but it was of no particular interest to Ronnie if they were destined to become lamb chops. STILLBORN When the three lambs started delivering stillborn lambs, Mr. Johnson . thought something seriously wrong and recommended that Ronnie sell the lambs. A disturbing fact, which may have been very useful, is that Durel Johnson made no effort to contact his veterinarian, Dr. James Walker in Glasco, Kansas to seek medical help or advice. When their dog Snowball was Ronnie, age 16, and his father, Durel Johnson, 52, with Geiger Counter used to measure for radiation (1971). -MUFON bleeding from his nose, he was immediately taken to Dr. Walker for treatment. One of the pertinent questions which may go unanswered is which three lambs produced the premature lambs. Were these three of the five lambs born prior to November 2, 1971 UFO landing or part of the twenty-six lambs born after that date? In this report the investigator elected to study the five lambs that were born before November 2,1971 for two reasons. .(1) If radiation was responsible, newly born lambs would have been more susceptible to radiation exposure than the lambs still being carried by the adult ewes. (2) Since the unusual factor in this case is the reduced time for the newly born lambs to conceive and reproduce, I have used the oldest lambs as a conservative factor. VETS CONSULTED Doctors of Veterinary Medicine when first confronted with these facts considered them from highly improbable to very unusual. However, these notes were given to several qualified doctors for their study, research, and their individual conclusions in 1973. Dr. Ralph Theobald, a Consultant to the Mutual UFO Network in Radiology, indicated that humans and animals subjected to overdoses of radiation could become sterile. (At first glance, a condition in direct contrast to this may have taken place; that of increased fertility.) Other facts gleaned from Robert Sturdy, D.V.M., head of the research laboratory for Moorman Manufactur- ing Company in Quincy, Illinois are: (1) An adult ewe has an estrous cycle of one year. (2) Sheep (ewes) are normally one year old before they conceive for the first time. (3) A fifty pound sheep is considered small for a mature adult. (4) Since the adult rams had no access to the fenced area containing the lambs being fattened for market (spaced double fence), they might be eliminated as suspect in these unusual births. (5) Biologically, insects have demonstrated the ability to reproduce without sexual contact or intercourse. (6) Veterinarian's textbooks reject the possibility of mammals, of the biological level of sheep, conceiving through (continued next page) 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"DELPHOS, KANSAS landing site wind direction NORTH original position of limb 75 ft. to witness RONNIE JOHNSON 5 ft. fence DELPHOS, Continued other than natural or artificial insemination. ASSUMPTIONS The following speculative study is based upon the following assumptions: (1) It is assumed that the five lambs born prior to the UFO landing on November 2, 1971, consisted of three females and two males. (2) They were directly effected in some biological 16 \\ flight path \\ tree knocked to ground manner due to the radiation or other exposure while in close proximity to the hovering UFO just outside of the sheep shed. Reconstructed data from Ronnie Johnson's F.A.A. records and the testimony of himself and his parents (Durel and Erma Johnson) confirm the birth of one developed lamp that survived one day, and the stillborn delivery of two underdeveloped premature lambs. If it is also assumed by the investigator that the first lamb born on Oct. 1,1971, during the normal lambing season was a female and the same fifty pound lamb that delivered the developed lamb on June 12, 1972, the time interval is approximately 8 l /2 months. Since this newborn lamb (the size of a cat) had formed hoofs and a wool skin, it is conceivable that it may have approached the normal 147 day gestation period for sheep (4.9 months). If the 4.9 month gestation period took place, the ewe lamb conceived when she was only 3.6 (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"'— ^ ' ^ r i\" 7 * li^ 1 »\\ *-W 1 s *T < ' ^•\"i*.

If the spaced double fence properly confined the two adult rams • from entering the fenced enclosure containing the lambs being raised by Ronnie Johnson, the obvious question arises: how did these three lambs become pregnant? Were the other two lambs born prior to November 1, 1971, males and responsible? Obviously, neither the investigator nor the Doctors of Veterinary Medicine that he consulted, had answers to this seemingly impossible feat.

By publishing this unique material exclusively in the Journal, the author/investigator, is seeking professional advice, comments, and further information from readers to explain this medical mystery associated with a UFO near- landing case that has apparent reproductive .implications.

SEGUIN, TX 78155 LETTERS Dear Editor, I find it encouraging that MUFON, a basically critical, scientific organization, is able to consider seriously a contact case like that of Eduard Meier (L. Parish, July-August 1984 issue, p. 19, and J. Deardorff, August 1985, p. 16) on the basis of the substantial evidence now available. I think we impoverish ourselves needlessly when we reject information- rich sources of potential understand- ing, where there is sufficient evidence of good faith and supporting data to justify a deeper study of any particular reported extraterrestrial contact. In Japan, Shinichi Seike, a young space-scientist, took seriously the books of George Adamski and found in them abundant clues to a new source of energy, non-polluting and omnipresent. In his \"Principles of Relativity,\" (Gravity Research Laboratory, Uwajima, Japan, 7th Edition, 1983), the author includes Adamski's familiar scout-ship photo as an illustration of a \"negative energy G-field engine\" embodying an advanced technology which he \"emphatically hopes will be peacefully used by his noble brothers and sisters....to make our planet a ' paradise.\" Since its publication in 1969, Seike's book has become a standard text in the nascent science of electro- gravitation. Readers are also referred to Dr. Hans Nieper's enormously important book, \"Revolution in Technology, Medicine and Society,\" (Oldenburg, West Germany, 1985). In this country, former President Carter showed that he took seriously the idea of a flourishing community of spacefaring civilizations, so often reported as a fact in the contactee literature, (see, for instance, the closing pages of Elizabeth Klarer's \"Beyond the Light Barrier,\" Timmons, Cape Town, S.A., 1980; German edition, 1977), where almost identical wording is used. In his \"Message to Extraterrestrials,\" included on board Voyager II, Mr. Carter said: \"This is a present from a small, distant world.... We are attempting to survive our times so that we may live into yours. We hope some day, having solved the problems we face, to join a community of galactic civilizations. This record represents our hope and our determination, and our good will in a vast and awesome universe.\" (Astronomy, vol. 13, no. 9, and Associated Press release.) William T.

They are collecting and preserving an important part of history. Without them the data would be lost forever. Equally important is their public interface. They are the only source of help for victims of UFO encounters. MUFON and CUFOS seem to be moving in the correct direction; but 1986 is a turning point. Therefore, we will not have long to wait to observe the results. Action and cooperation will make the difference. MUFON AMATEUR RADIO NET EVERY SATURDAY MORNING AT 0800 EST (OR DST) ON 7237 KHz S.S.B. JANUARY 1986 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Jupiter, in Capricornus, can still be seen in the SW, setting 2 hours after the sun in midmonth but only an hour after sunset by month's end. The crescent moon lies 5° west of the giant world on the 12th. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus disappears from the morning sky, leaving the predawn hours to Mars and Saturn. At midmonth Mars, in Libra, rises in the east about 2 AM, while Saturn, moving into Ophiuchus, rises in the ESE about 3:30.The crescent moon passes first Mars on the 5th then Saturn on the 7th. Halley's Comet: Halley has undergone a surprising 2-magnitude jump in brightness and thus should easily be observable with the naked eye after dusk during the first 2 weeks of January. Even so, binoculars will present a more pleasing view. A short tail shoud be seen. The comet begins the month just below the Water Jar of Aquarius and 3° east of Alpha Aquarii. Its new projected magnitude then may very well be about 3 l / 2 or 4. On January 1 look to the SW from about 6 to 9 PM (midnorthern latitudes). The fuzzy object lies 12° above Jupiter on the 12th. By the 15th, as the comet moves westward toward the sun, it is 4° east of Beta Aquarii and visible from about 6 to 7:30. After midmonth, both increasing moonlight and twilight will hamper viewing, and by the last week the comet will have disappeared into the sun's glare. Moon Phases: Last quarter-January 3 New rnoon--January 10 First quarter-January 17 Full moon-January 25 C The Stars: O The night sky of January features some of the brightest stars ever seen from our latitudes. Orion the Hunter now dominates the southern sky, and with its characterisitc hourglass shape and three belt stars in a row is one of the easiest constellations to recognize. Look for the glowing Orion Nebula in the hunter's sword below the belt. Surrounding Orion is a large halo of first-magnitude stars-the \"Winter Circle.\" Proceeding clockwise from the lower left, they are brilliant Sirius, Procyon, Pollux, and Castor the Twin Stars, Capella, Aldebaran, and Rigel. Just NW of Aldebaran is the beautiful little star cluster called the Pleiades or Seven Sisters, frequently mistaken for the Little Dipper. Whether observed with the naked eye, binoculars, or telescope, it is one of the outstanding sights in the winter sky and remains a lifetime favorite of all amateur skygazers. 18"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MESSAGE, Continued December 20th. A positive result of this meeting was Mrs. Waller's appointment of John R. Clem to be the State Section Director for seven north central Oklahoma counties surrounding Enid where John resides. Mrs. Ann Druffel, Treasurer of the North American UFO Federation, (NAUFOF), has advised the current status of what could have been a healthy and influential asset of Ufology on the North American Continent. The bank account was closed out at the end of 1985 with the payment of taxes and expenses. Mrs. Druffel summarized the termination of NAUFOF by saying \"In spite of the fact that NAUFOF did not fulfill its goals, we fought the good fight and tried our best. Perhaps the time was not right to achieve what we set out to do. Let us hope that in the not too distant future, a similar effort will enjoy more success.\" * * * Acting Director, John B. Musgrave, will soon make a public statement on the Board's decision for the future of NAUFOF. In the opinion of MUFON's International Director, Dr. Richard F. Haines, the original director of NAUFOF, was one of the few people in North America who could have been successful in this idealistic but difficult endeavor. John Schuessler was responsible for setting up the bylaws and establishing the first Board of Directors. The failure of NAUFOF was due to two major factors, the lack of support from APRO and CUFOS, and the negative personalities in a few small UFO splinter groups. The APRO Bulletin Volume 33, No. 1 announced the cessation of their bulletin. Informed sources in Tucson, Arizona have advised that Jim and Coral Lorenzcn have sold their home in Tucson and must give possession by January 15, 1986. Telephone callers to their home and office after Christmas were advised that the phones had been disconnected. Both Mr. and Mrs. Lorenzen will be missed on the UFO scene. Through their books, they shared the thousands of UFO reports submitted to APRO from members in North and South America. Mismanagement of APRO and the poor health of both in the past few years attributed to the decline of APRO as a viable organization and to its apparent termination.
