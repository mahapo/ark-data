As we all re- member, the largest recorded flap to hit the United States in modern history started on August 1, 1965, in Oklahoma, spreading to most of southwestern and western states. During July and August, Wisconsin had a lively rash of UFO sightings reported by Police officials and citizens. The effectiveness of the Midwest UFO Network as an investigating and reporting organization may be measured directly in relation to one of our over-all objectives. In Wisconsin, State Director Ron Anderson, along with State-Section Directors and Field Investigators, interviewed witnesses, conducted investigations, and forwarded their reports and newspaper clippings to MUFON and SKYLOOK. On the other hand, we did not have Field Investigators in north- west Kansas when the first newspaper reports on the wire services started arriving. Joe Brill personally wrote to all of the newspapers around Hays, Kansas, seeking their assistance. Both reporters and editors of the many newspapers in the area accepted the challenge and supplied the information which you will read in SKYLOOK. Your Di- rector has contacted each of the people who displayed a sincere in- terest in the UFO phenomenon with the goal of securing new Field In- vestigators and State-Section Directors in those counties in which we do not have representation. As State Director for Nebraska, Elmer Kral is going to be prepared for the next flap to visit the Corn husker State, by having trained personnel in every county. Elmer is pleased to announce the appoint- ment of Paul J. Kelley, 217 South Seventh Street, Albion, Nebraska 68620, to the position of State-Section Director for Boone and Nance counties. Paul is a retired school administrator holding a Masters Degree with an additional forty hours credit. He has had special- ized training in chemistry, geology and astronomy, which will be of definite aid during investigations. Robert Smuiling, Stete Director for Illinois, is rapidly covering each of the counties in the \"Land of Lincoln.\" He is proud to announce that Laurence P. Rybak, 3020 - 71st St., 'hodridge, Ill., 60515, has been appointed to the position of State-Section Director for DuPage and Kane counties. Larry is the Vice-president of the Art Eye Company. Missouri led the new Field Investigators parade this month, follow- ed by Illinois, Iowa and California. Ted Phillips, through lectures and radio broadcasts in Kansas City Mo., has created some very favorable publicity for MUFON, as evidenced by increased subscriptions to SKYLOOK. We are very anxious to develop an organized investigative grou in Kansas City; therefore, interested persons are invited to contact $hornas H. Nicholl, 9935 High Drive, Lea- wood, Kansas 61206, telephone AC 913 642-9320, or his business AC 816 753-7343.

Could This Be Another \"Snippy\"? Mrs. Eric Bluhm, an artist and journalist, of Ft. Wayne, Ind., is quick to note the unusual as a result of her training, and we have this report which could be another Snippy case. Mr. and Mrs. Bluhm were vacationing in the west in August, this year, and on Sunday, the 13th were en an all day jeep trip with other8 in Canyon de Chelly. Their guide was a Navajo Indian named Johnny. On the way up to the end of Ganyon de Muerte, where they were to have a box lunch, they saw a dead donkey lying in the sand. Mrs. Blumn at once noticed the exact strip 8 or 9 inches wide, cut from the donkey's neck about where P horse coliar would rest. The strip was as even as if it had been cut by a butcherand ljfted from the neck. No one else seemed to find this odd , but Mrs.Bluhm immediately thought of \"Snippy\" and with good reason. The donkey was bloated but Mrs. Bluhm could not venture a guess as to how long it had been dead. During the lunch break she asked Johnny about the donkey. He shrugged and said perhaps the aninal had caught itself on some barbed wire--this in spite of the fact Mr. Bluhm had seen no barbed wire in the entire area. She asked Johnny if he had ever aeen any UFOs and he said he had seen \"silver round things\" sometimes flying above him when he was down in the canyons. Asked what he thought they were \"he merely shrugged again in typical Indian fashionn and said no more. A woman in the party told Mrs.Bluhm later that Johnny's mother had reported seeing UFOs over . the canyons at least twice that she knew of. All the farms in the canyon area were Indian farms and lulrs. Bluhm says their horses are well groomed and the sheep well tended. All seem . to care for their farm animals and treat them kindly, and she cannot imagine one of the Indians cutting the donkey. She saw a few wire fences, but none with barba. We are sure our readers are a11 familer with the \"Snippyw case, so no need to make all the obvious comparisons. Thank you, Mrs. B., for a most interesting report. We'll keep in touch."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Now Hear This1 A Newspaper ASKS for UFO Reports - Reporter Says People Are Interested in UFOs - DALLAS TIMES HERALD Wants heliable Reports In a letter to Ye Ed from Bill Case, Aviation Writer for the Dallas Times Herald, Mr. Case points out that UFO investigators frequently mention that the metropolitan press does not publish UFO sightings. \"This isn't quite accurate,\" Case continues. \"The Times Herald has published every UFO report we have received and cross-checked them with authorities. We certainly do not 'shy away' from them or attempt to discredit them or the reporters.\" Came says they haven't received any UFO reports for more than two years and a check with the Dallas Police Department, Dallas County Sheriff's office and the Highway Patrol and Texas Rangers shows none have been received by them either. \"The public is sincerely interested in UFOs and any news of their sightings or related incidents. And the press is just as interested in receiving reliable reports from qualified reporters and observer^,^ Case writes. \"We believe there are UFO sightings in the Dallas - North 'l'exas area but the people making the sightings are reluctant to advise us because of a fear of ridicule. As a veteran reporter covtring avia- tion, science and aerospace plus medicine for 30 years, we have no desire to ridicule anyone. We would, however, like to talk directly to them in order to report their sighting correctly.\" Pi. Case suggests that SKYLOOK, if we think it newsworthy, inform our readers the Dallas Times Herald is looking for UFO reports, will report them as accurately as possible and protect the identity of the reporting source if they so wish. Well, we certainly DO consider it \"newsworthyw and we're glad to spread the word.

Dome-Shaped Object May Have Been Blimp Mr. Case (see article above) oints out the dome-shaped object seen by Miss \"Smith\" (see Sept. ~KYLOOK, page 14) may have been the Goodyear blimp \"America.\" Case writes: \"I also traveled this route at the same time on the same day. Just north of the state line I saw the Goodyear blimp *Americat off to the west ebout 1/2 mile.\" The blimp has 2,200 individual lights on its side and for safety reasons lights a number of these in red, blue and yellow in addition to its regular rotating beacon and running lights. The blimp follows highways on which its gfound crew travels in accompanying trucks etc and could appear to be following\" someone. Case adds that the two radial aircraft engines on the blimp are small and even under nquiet'l circumstances do not make much noise and very little sound would reach the ground, especially on a windy day.

N. H. It was 9:50 p.m. E.D.T. The boys were going to 'sleep outB In a partially-conatructed chicken coop. In less than 10 minutes the four frightened lads rushed indoors to tell ttm Smiths they had seen a atrange-shaped buaaing object with a fiery exhaust which apprcached tbe chicken coop shining a bright Hght. The object had four strut- Like legs with round pads, rectar,@lar protrusions and silver cable-like protrusions on top and was the shape of a decahedron. L Webster defines this as -a solid figure with KJ plane surfaces.\" Ye Ed had to look this up and thought some of you ndght too.7 The Smitha left their TV program (there had been no interference) to go outside just in time to see and hear something flying over a nearby mamp. They thought it must be a helioopter altho it did not look like one. The boys mere adamant that it was not a helicopter, so Mr. Smith asparated the two older boys and asked them to draw a rough skebh of what they had seen. He was surprised to see both drawings were consistent and of an unconventional craft. He then reported the incident to the USAF Tracking Station at New Boston, N.H., and one of the emplopem contacted a UFO investigator, an associate of by Fouler, who conducted a teb- phone interview with Mr. Sllith and then contacted Mr. Fwbr. In the course of his investigation, Mr. Fowler checked with the USAF Tracking Station and learned nothing had been seen on their radar screen at the time of the sighting, and also that their radars track satellites and would not pick up anything at the lar altitude of the reported object. A check was made with the FAA Air Traffic Control Center at Nashua; the FAA Air Traffic Control Tower at Manchester Airport; the FAA Concord Flight Service; Uiggms Airways at Norvood, Mass.; the EAF P.I.O. at Hanscom Field, Bedfold and at Pease AFB and the Air National hard. Replies indicated nothing unusual was seen on radar and no flights were logged in the vicinity of Holly Hill at tb time of the sighting. (Holly Hill and the names of witnesses are asmd namss --real names on fib.) Mr. Fcwler also phoned ths Cantorbu1-J Police Department to see if anyone elso had reported a UFO on the 13th of May and was told no one had. The Police Chief gave Mr. Smlth a good character rating as a good citizen and a personal friend. Mr. Fowler mde an appointment to interview the witnesses at the Smith horn the evening of %y 2bth. During the telephone conversation, he asked if the boys had access to UFO literature or had shown interest in UFOs and was told they had not. At the interviews held at the Smith home additional details re the sighting were laarned. Just before ilr. Srq~1.h had Wt the boys at tho chicken coop, lo- cated beside a barn and open to a large field on to the west, the boys asked him what the very bright star was which they called \"the North Starn but he was not abh to identify it. Then ten minutes later, one of the boys, vho was still looking at the so-called \"North Starn (actually Venus) shouted to the others thatvere were now two north stars out there and one was heading toward them. The other boy8 sat up and looked up to see a very bright light source descend- ing slowly toward the field from the WNW. They heard a sound coming irom it and jump ed out of their sleeping bags and onto the edge of the field outside to see what they thought was a helicopter coming down. he had his father's sealed- beam flashlight with him and aimed it at the object as it continued to corn closer. The the object did samething which seemed very strange to tnem. It suddenly and yet very smoothly, \"like n Palline, floating balloonn, descended in a strange naideuays zig-zagn manner. The object abruptly slowed to a near stanl still when Don actually got the beam of the flashlight on the object as it (Continued on Next Page) 5"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"mcved almost directly over them. It was just in those hst feu seconds that they saw the object was neither helicopter or normal aircraft and the sight of \"it0 sent them all scurrying up the dlrt road to the house. The boys described the object as decahedron in shape and flying nth its for- ward moving side tilted at a b5 degree angle. It had b \"pole-liken legs wlth \"round padst1 affired to the end of each leg. A brizht white light m the for- ward moving, or front, side seemed to twn on them and lit up the coop and the surround~ng area. As it passed nearly directly over and by them, a flashing red light *like the color of a heat-lamp used to keep a chicken coop warm\" was on the object's trailing side. A fiery 10-foot long exhaust poured down from the ob- ject's underside which alternately \"changed colors as if they were switched from one to another.\" Colors rememered were purple, blue, orange, red and white. The object made a loud \"grinding sound.11 When asked to compare this sound wlth something comon, they all agreed that tne closest sound would have Peen a It loud buzzing sound.\" All the boys noticed that there were a number of bright silver inverted U- shaped mcable-likel' things sticking into tne top and around the top of the object in a mass \"like hair\" except the round cable-llke wires were estimted to bs IrN In diameter. Only Bob caught a glimpse of \"suitcasesn (rectangular box-like protrusions) affixed to the sides of the object. No air movement, heat or smell were noticed. The object was clearly seen and illuminated by the lights and colored exhaust. The surface of the object appeared to be a \"silverish-redn and the pads on each leg seemed to be colored an \"orangish-red.n The object appeared to be 150 feet overhead as it passed almost over them. Its size was estimted to be between one-two car lengths wide and one-two car lengths (cars standing on end) tall. A Dachsund slept undisturbed Ln the coop but their cat \"took off like a bullet1' during the sightlng. Phe Smiths cmfind they had reached outside just in time to see a slw- moving white and red flashing lieht noving away and low over a swamp across the road from their house. A sound, somewhat like a jet but not like a propeller of an airplane or helicopter, came from the direction of the receding object. It8 outline was not seen by either of the adult.. The boys, who did not want to go back outside to sleep, insisted the abject was not a helicopter (as Mr. Smith suggested to the=) and it was then he asked Don and Bob, the oldest boys, to draw a sketch of what they had seen. This, coupled with the unfamihar noise and the lights he had seen, prompted b. Smith to phone the Tracking btntion. Mr. Fowler checked with others living in the area t3 see if anyone else had seen or heard awthing unusual. One couple couldn't recall if they had been at horn that night; another was out of the state at the time. One man said he was outside at the tim but hadn't seen or heard anything unusual, but probably would have paid no attention to a plane or helicopter going over. He did remember that his wife had come out to complain about some exceptionally bad W inter- ference just before 10 P.M. A mra. 'Xn said that sometime between 9 and 10 P.H. she heard a very loud jet engine and opened the bathroom window to see what it was, but saw nothing. It seemed unusual because it suddenly died from a loud roar to nothing and did not gradually fade away as jet aircraft usually do. A Mr. \"Jones\" said that he heard a loud roar like a low-flying throttled- back jet or prop bomber makes shortly before 10 P.X. and stepped outside to see what it was. He saw low-flying slow-moving lights but did not see what ms carrying them. Hir interpretation was that it was one of the b-engine bombers that had been flying over lately with a landing Light on its nose and yellowish lights shining downward from its opn bomb-bay. He had probably seen the b- engine turbo-prop Air Search and Rescue aircraft flying a search mission for a missing private aircraft. Fowler learned the search hsd been called off 13ag 13th. Another man questimed stated that sometime after dark on the Uth of May he had noticed one red li~ht flowlng over the power lines in about due north direction. (Continued on Next Page) 6"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"He thought it was a hellcopter and thought no more about it until Ur. Smith told him about the sighting of the 13th. Two young women said they were watching a movie at a drive-in theatre and both saw a strange horizontal set of little square lights (white) moving north to south between 9:&5 and 10 P.U. No identification llghts or actual object/ aircraft was seen but they both felt it looked out-of-the-ordinary. In checking with the boys' teachers .at school and with others well ac- quainted with the boys and their parents, including a minister who had visited the Smiths to ask about the sighting, the concensus was that the boys and Mr. and Mrs. Smith described what they actually saw and would not lie or have any part in perpetrating a hoax. KT. Fowler's personal conclusione, after the rmny interviews, concurs. An interesting paragraph in his sumtion of the case is: \"There is a rough similarity of the reported UFO to the Apollo Lunar Module and had I not examined this incident personally, I could easily have dismissed the incident as a case of over-imaginative boys exaggerating as a helicopter flew over and giving it lunar Module descrlpticn. The descri2tion certainly does not fit the typical oval or cylindrical UW usually reported although it is possible that the object was in actuality in the shape of a top which certainly has been reported in tne past. They all alluded to an \"edge\" or \"rid' that went around the object. Both a decahedron and top would exhibit such. The multi-colored exhaust and the \"falling-ledn descent also are typical characteristics of Uns. One can only speculate what such an object was doing. It would appear that it was going to land, perhaps somewhere in the swamp it, was heading over.\" And he concludes, \"& evaluation of the Holly Hill sighting on the Smith property is that it represents a UFO in the 'Significant Unknown* categorg.\" Editor's Note: This was written from Mr. Fowler's 36-page report of his investigation of this most interesting case. His report is a model of emellent investigating--had space permitted we w~uld have used every word. We hope we have mcceeded in getting all the salient facts in thin condensed version.

Gross, of Kirksville, Mo., had been to the family farm about 14 miles northwest of Kirsville and was returning to the city on Route 149 when she sighted a UFO at 7:30 P.M. She told police she was rounding a curve on the road about 8 miles from Kirksville when she saw a bright silvery light through the trees. Continuing to drive very slowly, k5. Gross watched the object she described as a \"bright silver ball.\" \"It hovered in one spot and suddenly bounced to another,\" she said. \"I saw it in about five different locations before it vanished from sight.\" Interviewed by Walter H. Andrus, Mrs. Cross said the object appear- ed in the southeast and was under observation about a minute and a half. She compared the size to that of a child's kite. The sky was overcast at 5,000 feet, with visibility at 11 miles.

It was about 2:30 a.m. on August 21, 1972. Suddenly the electrical system in the 1963 Plymouth went dead. Faltersack braked, skidded nerrly 25 feet across the road and halted on a shoulder. The night was hazy, but he had no difficulty seeing what he de- scribed as a large, orange, circular object 20 to 30 feet in diameter hovering at tree-top level. After about 10 seconds, he told authorities, the object made a strange nbeeping\" noise, and took off into the sky and out of view. Faltersack then could start the car, but the lights, horn and radio wouldn't work. He drove home and called the Waukesha County Sheriff's off ice. Two deputies questioned Faltersack, a restaurant manager who is planning to join the Air Force. His sister, Mrs. Lenore Hildebrandt, said the lawmen were \"serio~s.~ The deputies found that all the auto fuses had been blown and that the car had become overheated. They found the skid marks at the scene and noted the trees were about 40 feet high. Their report described Faltersack as \"stone cold sober,\" and \"ex- tremely upset and nervous, unable even to light a cigarette.\" Sgt. Herman Sprung said, \"Faltersack hadn't been drinking and we're not discounting this as a hoax.\" He added that Brown County Sheriff's deputies earlier this summer reported sighting a similar object.

More Reports from Wisconsin The July 29, 1972 issue of the \"Sheboygan Pressw reported that unidentified flying objects were sighted in Shawano, Waupaca, Out- agamie and Brown Counties of eastern Wisconsin early that morning. A Shawano County officer described the object sighted there as appearing bright orange and about the size of a volleyball from a distance of two or three miles and a height of 800 feet. He said it followed a zig-zag pattern across the sky. It was reported seen at Gresham, Caroline and Pella in Shawano County and Clintonville, Waupaca and Embarrass in Waupaca County. A spokesman for the National Weather Service office in Milwaukee said the description of the object \"was a great description of a weather balloonDW but he said he did not kncw if one was aloft in the area where the sightings occurred. Dale Gaddis, Federal Aviation Administration controller at Austin- Straubel Field in Green Bay said he knew of no weather balloon aloft in the area where the sightings were made. Credit: Leonard W.

Krause had his German shepherd with him and said the dog usually sits in the back of the car and looks out the window--but this time the dog ley on the floor of the car and whimpered. As he was driving along the road, keeping the object in view, he noticed five other dogs, all cowering and acting strangely. A woman called in to report seeing this light at tree to level. 8 She said it had a high pitched tone and was heading toward resham. The mail plane out of Green Bay came within 50 yards of the object, which then disappeared. Another sighting was mede by chief Krause at 11 p.m. July 25th. He saw a round ball, the size of a basketball ngoing through a white channeln in the sky north d Gresham. It was very bright, and he thought it might be the northern lights; but there was a nwhite globn just to its right and wnen he reached for his camera, the ball went into the \"globn and disappeared. As the ball moved through a white curving nchannel\" it was followed by waves of pink and yellow bands of light. Ronald Anderson also obtained a report from Sgt. Dennis Kussman, a traffic officer on duty the morning of July 29th. Sgt. Kussman and two other officers were working on a radar detail on Highway 45 between Marion and Clintonville when they received calls from the Shawano County Sheriffs' Uepartment and the Waupaca Traffic Police, stating an object was being observed and asking if they could see it. The three officers got into one car and headed northwest on 45 toward Tigerton. About 4 miles south at the intersection of county road \"MW and 45, one of the officers spotted an object just sbove the trees to the east. It was a very bright light, yellowish in color, and he stated he had never seen anything like it before. He said the closest he cduld come to describing it was to compare it to a parachute flare. The object was observed through field glasses and no outline could be seen although several red and green lights were observed behind the main light. lhey turned a spotlight on the object which \"went outw and stayed out five minutes or more, then reappeared. It looked like a very distant star, but then became very bright and back to its original size and appearance. The spotlight was turned on the object again, and again it \"went outn and then reappeared. It was at this time they received a call from the Clintonville Police Department, stating that an orange-colored object was being observed east of the city. The officers talked back and forth and it appeared two different objects were being observed. - Mr. Anderson notes there is a swamp 20 miles long and 5 miles wide in the area where the objects were spotted. 9"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Physical Traces - Material Evidence of UFO's? . . .

On May 18 we were in Moron, interviewing the, local group of stu- dents of the UFO phenomenon. Don Luis Camecho l'loreno, director of \"Youth Radio,\" delivered to us a report form duly filled out. According to the collected evidence the events occurred as follows: Some tenant farmers from the farm \"Rancho del Maestro Oliva,\" several kilometers from Moron and not far from the joint Base, could hear about three in the morning three deafenin? ex- plosions, from the \"Casila GordilloDn (name of one of them situat- ed some 500 meters from the place of the traces. On the morning of . Monday, May 11, they found in their fields of sunflowers (raised, for oil), two strange and very complex tracks. The sight of such tracks in connection with the explosions during the night, led them to go to the Headquarters of the Civil Cuerd. The lieutenant in- spected the place and decided that it was a matter of markings caused by electric discharges from some storm. Thus decided, he ordered that the affected parts be plowed up and th~t the affair not be mentioned again.But the farmers later went to the agricultural exten- sion service, seeking some indemnity. The experts of the service carried out a technical inspection and took samples of soil and of plants. And apparently they communicated the case to the appropriate Ministry. It appears that was the way by which the press, radio and tebvision in Madrid found out about the event. In consequence some agencies of the press dispatched reporters to the place. Up to Wednesday, May 13, the local UFO students did not come and the re- porter transmitted a brief dispatch to the newspapers in Seville. When we had arrived, the area affected had been plowed up; however one sup oses that the tracks themselves were in part respected. !he traces were composed of the following elements: 1. Two central holes, 6 cm. in diameter and 35 cm. in depth, separated between themselves by some 15 cm. 2. Flattening of a circular zone of 30 cm., surrounding the aforementioned holes. 3. Five entrances in the ground around the flattened area which, united by a straight line, would form a regular pentagon, and whose circumscribed circle would have a diameter of 1.1 meters. 4. These five entrances in the ground, with an inclination of 30 degrees, are each divided in two tunnels, as though produced by a perforating instrument in the form of a pitch- fork. 5. A surrounding zone, of some 25 meters diameter, where the small sunflower plants are found affected by radial blasts. 6. This surrounding zone extends to a circumference tangent to the zone of another track in total equal to the first. Our examination of samples: a) A portion of the interior wall of one of the tunnels. It resents an aspect of coal. rough and dull on the outside, and brilliant and polished withinDewhic6 perhaps could not correspond to the metallic nature of the forked object which made the hole, and where with a magnifying glass, can be ob- served granules of metallic sheen, which would reveal the class of metal of the forked object. b) Two plants examined, of some 10 cm.

By various ways samples were sent to centers for study in Seville. For our part we began endeavors to secure for ourselves a reliable scientific examination of these different samples which we have held in our hands. Note: A second article translated by the Armstrongs \"The Mystery of the Baked Earth at Moronw (CAMPO, Sevilla, No. 338, May 1970) reviews the case and includes an interview with Don Juan Pomares, Chief Engineer of the Bureau of Agronomy. We quote his final conclusions: W1. We discard the possibility that the injuries of the plants might have been from a sickness characteristic of them. \"2. The damages caused have been from exterior effects which were produced in a fortuitous and isolated manner on May 11, more damages . not having been produced since the said day in which were discovered the tracks and the injured plants. .Nor will the disorder continue being extended through any other part of the sector. \"3. Everything that happened at the Rancho del Maestro Oliva is not usual in agriculture. Nor do we believe that there might be another similar case. For had there been some agricultural disease, it would have spread and would have been discovered. \"4. If this phenomenon had been a disease characteristic of the plants, the technicians of the Agronomy Bureau would have continued the investigations.\" ..................................................................... Orange UFO Sighted in Chicam Suburbs Chicago Daily News, Aug. 11, 1972 - A football-shaped object that glowed orange and hovered over the ground was sighted by motorists early today in the areas of Bensenville, Lombard and Oak Brook. State Police in Elgin, the DuPage County sheriff's office and su- burban police departments reported receiving telephone calls concern- ing the- strange sight. Onecaller said he was driving in Ill. Hwy. 83 near Irving Park Road in Bensenville when he saw the strange object. \"It was shaped like a football and had a rim around it.\" he said. \"It was about 50 feet long and wind~wless.~ He said it continued to pulsate colors, first a bright orange, then lighter orange, then gray and then bright orange again. The motorist said the object was only 60 feet off the ground and about 200 feet away from him. After ebout 15 seconds, he said, it flew over his car and disappeared. He added that when it moved it made no noise and left no smoke. Other motorists in the vicinity got out of their cars to look at- the object, the motorist said. The sightings all seem to have occurred between 5:30 and 6 a.m. Credit: Thomas h. Miller. A special Welcome to all our new readers from the Kansas city, Mo.-Kens. area.

The ring, an almost perfect circle 7 to 8 feet in diameter, was coated with a dark oily substance which became a blue-white powder when heated by the sun. A sample of the powder is being analysed, and results should be available in the very near future. As of this writing, no UFO was reported at the site. August 26: Mrs. T. S. and a companion observed a large, bright red object hover1 in the western sky about 30 degrees above the horizon at 10:30 p.m.?he women went indoors and when they looked again at 11 p.m., the object had disa peered. Mrs. S. stated the object appear- ad larger and brighter than genus. It did not pulsate. August 27: T. D., a resident of SedaUa, reported seeing a bright yellow sphere moving from east to west at a very slow rate of speed ebout 1:30 to 2:00 a.m. The witness held a quarter at arms length to determine the object's diameter. It would have had an apparent diameter at least 10 times that of Venus. The object was observed for 10 minutes and no sound was heard and no other lights seen. The witness is fam- iliar with various types of aircraft and is sure that he would have heard sound had the object been one.After about 10 minutes the color changed to dark red and the object gained speed, disappearing in less than 30 seconds. Another witness, who may have observed the same object, reported the observation of a bright yellow sphere at about 1:30 a.m. from a point six miles northwest of Mr. D. The object was moving slowly. August 28: Larry Yoder, of Moberly, some 60 miles northeast of Sedalia, reported a round yellow-orange object was seen moving west to east at a low speed at about 1:35 a.m. At was observed for a minute and a half at an estimeted altitude of 8,000-10,000 feet. 'lhe light was pulsating, but no sound was heard. The object changed course to a wide turn to the southeast. The sky was clear, moon and stars visible. August 22: Mr. b. H. observed a round object as it passed over his farm home at about 10 p.m. There was no sound and the object passed from west to east at a fairly high speed. The witness could see a definite round shape with a ring of lights underneath around the outer edge. A larger yellow circular light was located at the center. The following Sunday while at church,a neighbor mentioned that he had seen an unusual object passing silently through the sky. It was then determined that they had indeed seen the same object, through separated by almost a mile. Both were amazed at the lack of sound from such a low flying object. The sightings lasted about 2 minutes, with three known observers. Editor's Note: The August 31 edition of \"The Sedalia Capitol\" carried a report of the Sedalia sightings, as reported by Mr. Phillips, and added the Whiteman AFB near Sedalia said the base has no explanation for the sightings. The Air Force presently is conducting electronic tests over missile silos in which helicopters are used, but the tests are not administered at night.

It was a calm, moonlit night and he suddenly noticed a \"black cloudn moving rapidly and low down the river course. He described the cloud as a long, flattened oval, like a German loaf of bread. It passed di- rectly overhead and made a low \"whining, hissing, roaring, whistling sound.\" It disappeared into the east, angling slightly toward the south. No details of the \"cloudn could be observed, and there were no lights. Szatko had left the car engine running to recharge the battery after using the trunk light in his fishing, and after the object passed overhead, he noticed the engine was not running. He is not sure if he had turned it off and forgotten in the excitement of observing the object--or if the engine died when the object passed overhead. Eldon 8. Ervin, of Grand Island, Nebr., who interviewed Mr. Szatko, atates the observer gave a straight forward account of what he had seen and he has no doubt of his sincerity. Couple Follows Glowinn Object Miss. ~areh Buck and Rick Forrler were waitinn for a traffic signal to change at the intersection of Lemav - Ferry and Baylesa roads, Sunday, AU~, 6 at 10:lO P.M. when they ob- served a large white-yellow glowing object hovering overhead. After a moment the object split into two separate objects and one moved to the northeast and the other to the north. Since the young couple were heading into St. Louis on Lemay (northeast) they kept that ob- ject under observation. At the Monsanto Plant on Germania, just west of Lemay (Missouri), the object circled the smoke stack and then headed west, at which point the young people gave up the chase. At the time the object split into two parts, it also changed color to a bright red orange on the bottom and a glowing white on the top. The width of the object was compared to the that of the smokestack, and its shape was the familar saucer shape. The Monsanto smoke stack is 15 feet in diameter.

Through this instrument the object resembled a crystal. Its exterior had a jell- like appearance, and it had three rib-like projections and two antenae. \"By nmaua of the unaided eye it was not possible to see tho object very clear4 though its glov could be noticed. We started our observations at apprurisately the same time when the sun receded behind the horiaon. The object was in close proximity to the noon. After a while it moved due northeast and stopped fof a minute in a fixed position. .Rcm the very beginning the body had a white glow, but later it began to tum red. This was obviously a reflection of the setting sun which from our point of vim on earth had already set.

As can be seen the body changed its dhctim of mve- ment twice and completely disappeared as it approached Venus. Dr. Dobrev de- fined its color as \"a silreriah glen“ and \"becoming or taking on a plrple toward the edges.\" The object was leaving a purple mist behind it. One interesting de- tail, Dr. Dobrev also noticed was that a satellite crossed the path of the object , but while the satellite was moving rapidly and on a straight course, the mve- nent of the object was alw, circular and with changes of direction. Another curiousity was that during the th when the object was abve Ruse, strong stat10 interferenee distorted the functioning of the radio sets there.

A sharp wind came up shortly after totality began although At had been a dead calm before. The temperature drop- ped from the 60 to a bitter chill. \"Our only available DC-3 almoat at once began loading for the return to Inuvik. It was 8:15 p.m., between bouts with the ever chang- ing fog before the last group returned to the Electra.

It was announced on national TV news and by the Press that a Garden City, Kansas, store reported selling nearly one hundred six-foot Army surplus weather balloons. The purchasers told the owner they fill the balloons with helium or hydrogen, attack flashlights inside or out- si.de, release them and \"scare my neighbors to death.'t It now seems this may account for the many UFO si5hti.ngs in and about Dighton, Kansas during the :mnth of August. be mentioned these in the September issue of SKYLOOK :pages 13-14) and slnce then have received many news clippings. Ye Ed tlkes this opportunity to thank everyone who sent us the clippings. dr thought these sightings would be this monthls feature story, but in vlew of the disclosures re the tricksters sending up weather balloons, we feel these repor2s now have little or no value. It is our personal opinion that some of the first sightings may have been UFOs--and probably were-- and the resulting publicity gave the kids (at least of \"kid\" mentality) the idea it would be \"fun\" to fake it. We hope the responsible citizens who saw and reported the unusual lights will no5 feel they have been made objects of ridicule. They were doing exactly whst any citizen should do on seeing an unidentified flying object--report it so an investigation can follow. And zhs in- vestigqtion which did follow resulted in the \"identification.\" As for the pranksters, we have just two words for you--grow up. More Sightings at Arkansas City, Kans, On August 25th the Arkansas City Police said an unidentified man li ving east of Arkansas City telephoned thez that 3 large object was sighted over his house and over the nearby home of his father. He said the house began to shake and he went outside to see if the object was still there but it had taken off. He told the police dis- patcher the object he saw shook the house and rattl-ed dishes in a cupboard. The same night Jimmie Lambert, a cafe mner, said he watch- ed a saucer-shaped object through binoculars about 30 miriutes. He said there was a red ring around the object. Ken Thompson, city manager and Erwin Knocke, city commissioner, described an object with flashing red lights that disappeared at a high rate of speed after about 30 minutes. Beth Lilley, reporter for the \"Arkansas City Daily Traveler\", on being notified of a UFO being sighted by three police officers, drovo to the top of a hill within the city limits and observed the object and took a picture of it. She described the object as being extremeb large and bright,somewhat round in shape with varying lengths of ap- parent light rays beaming from its. edges. Within a few moments, she said, a large glowing circle appeared around the object and twinkliljs red lights could be seen on what appeared to be the front of the ob- ject. Within two to four minutes, the bright glow seemed to be absorb ed into the body of the object which then appeared to charge to a triangular shape. First sighted at 4 a.m., by 7:05 aim. it had risen so high that it appeared to be pinhead size and barely visible. UFO or weather balloon?
