Short Editor-Publisher Emeritus Len Stringf ield Editorial Assistant Editor's Column I am very pleased to announce that veteran UFO investigator and writer Len Stringfield is joining SKYLOOK as an editorial assistant, further enhancing what most observers feel is the best staff on any UFO magazine in the world. Len has contributed several reports in the past as a field investigator for MUFON. Current plans call for him to write a by-lined column each month in which he pieces together a num- ber of reports, news items, and comments. Hopefully, he will also find time to occasionally work on a feature article which requires more than the usual amount of work, thus further lightening the editor's load. Len is no stranger to UFO publications, having published and edited the monthly newslet- ter ORBIT from 1953 to 1957 (with a paid circulation of 2500). During these years Len was director of an internation- al UFO research group known as CRIFO (Civilian Research, In- terplanetary Flying Objects), the largest research group op- erating at that time. Also during the 1953-1957 period, Len worked in coopera- tion with the Air Defense Com- mand of the U.S. Air Force, in- vestigating and reporting UFO activity. In 19S7 he published a paper- back book entitled IMSIDE SAUCER POST, 3-0 BLUE, which reviewed his work during the 1953-1957 period. The title comes from part of his Air Force code number. (Inciden- tally, Len still has a few cop- ies of this book available for $3.00. I recommend it.) Other work in the field in- cludes public relations for NI- CAP from 1957 to 1970, early warning coordinator for the Colorado Project under Dr. Con- don from 1967 to 1969, presi- dent of the Cincinnati UFO So- ciety in the late 1950's, in- vestigator for the Center for UFO Studies, and investigator and director of public rela- tions for MUFON. He is employed as director of public relations and market- ing services for DuBois Chemi- cals in Cincinnati.

EDITOR'S NOTE: The following is a preliminary report on a possible close encounter UFO experience which occurred in the -vicinity of Alton, IL., on the night of -Oct. 12-13, 1975. The term \"UFO experience\" is used here in its most ..general sense, for although the witness observed entities similar to those described in many, close encounter UFO reports .of the third variety, at no time dur- ing, prior to, or following the experience did she see any ob- ject or 'vehicle with which these entities may have been associated. The witness has re- quested that her name not be used (it is on file with SKY- -LOOK), and that the exact loca- tion of the incident not be published. The report is .based on-two tape recorded interviews with the witness. The case was referred to the investigator by the Center for UFO Studies., The Witness 1 The only witness in this case is Mrs. X, _ a housewife, 26 years old, who resides with her husband and three children in a subdivision near Alton. Prior to her UFO experience on Oct. 13, Mrs. X had had no particu- 'lar interest in the subject of UFOs other than that acquired from-reading occasional news- paper accounts of UFO sight- ings. The Incident On the night of Oct. 12 (Sun- day) , Mrs. X waited up to see her husband leave for work at about 11:30 p.m. Although she Woods L Hicks residence Drive wasn't especially tired, she then went to bed and slept for approximately 2 hours. The bed- room is located on the upper floor of the house; its window faces north and looks out on a wooded area that extends about 250 feet behind the house. Be- yond this wooded area lies an abandoned quarry. (See Sketch 1.) Mrs. X awoke at about 1:30 a.m. and tried to get back to sleep, reflecting on the events of the day before. At this time, the family dog (\"Sarge\"), a 5-year-old Irish sheep dog, was sleeping on the lower floor near a patio door at the rear of the house. This door is situated on the same wall as the window of the bedroom upstairs, and thus of- fers the same view .of the aforementioned wooded area be- hind the house. The only light in the house at the time the incident occurred was a small night light in the bathroom on the first floor. Also, it should be pointed out that the subdivision in which Mrs. X re- sides is very dark at night, for there are no street-lights. At approximately 0200 on Oct. 13, Mrs. X heard the dog bark in a \"vicious\" tone that she had never heard before. Think- ing that a fox or raccoon might have been disturbing the garb- age (which event had occurred in the past), she arose immedi- ately, without turning on any lights, and looked out the bed- room window. It was then that she saw a human-like entity run from the Page 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"vicinity of the rear of the house towards the wooded area-- a distance later determined to be 55 ft. (See Sketch. 1.) She thought to herself: What could that be?, and reported that her first impression was that of a silver wolf running on two legs. She said: The Entities \"I was trying to rationalize, when it turned and looked di- rectly at me--or toward the back of the house, I should say. It was definitely the figure of a man. It was about 3% feet tall, and it was lumin- ous from head to toe, like aluminum foil would (glow) with a light cast on it in the dark --a glow like that.\" .(See Sketch 2.) Mrs. X kept her eyes on the entity as it stood still for a moment or so, \"like it was de- bating whether to come back in- to the yard or go back into the woods.\" (Note: The yard behind the house is not fenced in, and thus leads directly into the woods.) At that time, three more en- tities, identical in appearance to entity no. 1, came into Mrs. X's field of vision from the vicinity of the house immedi- ately next door (west) to hers. (See Sketch 1.) These three entities joined entity no. 1, and all four entities then ran, in single-file, back into the woods. Mrs. X lay back down in bed at that point. Aside from her three young children and the family dog, she was alone in the house. She reported that she was very frightened: \"It terrified me. I've never been so frightened....! don't get scared easily, but I was lying there and I knew what I had seen...JI wanted to see more--! wanted to see if they took off or if they turned in the woods or what, but I was too afraid to look because I thought, if it (entity no. 1) had seen me staring at it, then I didn't know if it might get brave and decide to come back and try to get into the house, Page 4 or what.\" Mrs. X then called her hus- band and asked him to come home at once, which he did. Mr. X and a neighbor armed themselves and searched the wooded area behind the house, as did sev- eral Alton, IL., police offi- cers whom Mr. X had called to report the experience. No evidence of anything out of the ordinary was found, nor were any personal possessions or household objects missing from the Xs' residence then or following the experience. So far as is known as of this writing, -no neighbors or resi- dents in the general area had REPORTED any UFO sightings or experiences on or near the 13th of October. Additional Details Further details about the entities and the experience in general are as follow: APPEARANCE AND BEHAVIOR OF ENTITIES. All four entities were alike: \"Their bodies were erect.... They all ran stiff-legged, like they were on their heels—like their feet were pointed up.... Everything (about their bodies) was pretty well proportioned... Everything was covered. It looked like it was all one piece from head to .toe, and it was all the same color (silver) ....Aluminum foil is what it most resembled to me....The outfit was silver, but it gave off a white glow....They lit up the path .as they went. They had nothing in their hands that I could tell. But they gave off a glow....\" Mrs. X reported that the en- tities resembled a human more than a robot. At no time dur- ing the experience did she hear or see the entities talk among themselves or communicate by any kind of gestures. Nor could she discern any features or de- tails in the facial area, for unlike the rest of their bod- ies, the facial area was dark. UNUSUAL QUIETUDE. Mrs. X mentioned that she had noticed an unusual silence at the time of her experience: \"Everything was so quiet out there--you didn't hear a bush, you didn't hear anything. It was just unusual....There was no wind, and it was really quiet. Everything was still— it was just very, very still.\" When queried about what sounds she might ordinarily ex- pect to hear at that time of the morning, she suggested the chirping of birds or crickets, the wind--\"just sounds; nothing that you'd really listen to or pay attention to. It just stuck in my mind that it was dead quiet. \"It was so quiet that, even with the window closed, with the four of them going down in- to the woods, they would have rattled enough branches and leaves on the ground .to make noise, and they DIDN'T make any noise....To me, I remember it being awfully still.\" Concluding Remarks On the morning following her experience, Mrs. X composed two pages of notes, recounting the events of the previous night. She also called the ST. LOUIS POST DISPATCH to inquire about the name and phone number of a local UFO organization to which she could report her experi- ence. She was advised to con- tact Dr. J. Allen Hynek of the Center for UFO Studies, whom"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Youth reports series of encounters Cincinnati area has variety of sightings By ten Stringfield EDITOR'S NOTE: Following is a list of preliminary reports from the greater Cincinnati area for the period Oct. 22- Noy.10,1975.

Personal Impressions. • Throughout the course of a- bout five hours (total) discus- sion with Mrs. X, this investi- gator found her to be intelli- gent, articulate, and.thorough- ly sincere. Her account of what she had seen remained consis- tent, both in her own descrip- tion of her experience and in her responses to questions a- bout the experience. . . ..

However, whether this experience in- volved entities of an anomalous nature and from an unknown source or (human) pranksters remains an open question. house ^window. They went out- doors expecting to see .\"vic- tory\" fireworks. Instead they were surprised to see their neighbor's house, yard, trees, and \" street bathed in a red glow.-. Both saw a round, . red ball in the sky moving low and soundlessly across the sky in a horizontal flight pattern. Oct. 23, 1975: About 9 p.m. S.C. and girlfriend and another female passenger in car in Fairfield, OH, were pursued by a low level UFO. The UFO passed over the car and while driving up a grade in -the road, the UFO's cigar-shape was caught in the car's headlights. UFO sent out a rod device with four small orange balls at the tip. Girls became hysterical. Oct. 26, 1975: About 1:20 p.m., an \"instrument rated\" pilot in Cherokee craft, flying near New Baltimore, OH, called to the control tower of the Greater Cincinnati Airport to report observing an unidenti- fied silver, hovering object at 8000 ft., in clear weather, visibility 12 miles. Radar confirmation negative, but the UFO may have been undetected by radar's \"cancellation\" effect. The UFO. shot off and out of view. Oct. 27, 1975: At 8:30 a.m. two artists for a publishing company in Eastern .Cincinnati saw a brilliantly lighted disc from their second story office window. The UFO hovered, and occasionally vacillated jerk- ily, over electric power line, about a half mile away. After about 30 to 40 seconds, the UFO shot off . at 30-degree angle with the incredible speed of a \"flashlight beam.\" Oct. 27, 1975: About 11 p.m. Cincinnati police officers re- ported seeing UFO in eastern Cincinnati. They • described it as a large bright light with little red lights on both ends. One officer on duty drove to Ault Park, at a higher alti- tude i to view the light. He confirmed the unidentified light. \"I've never seen anyr thing like it,\" he said. Oct. 27, 197.5: About 10:45 p.m. J. H. of Westwood in West- ern Cincinnati saw two UFOs for about 10 minutes. He said they were about 1000 ft. high and flying back and forth about 100 feet apart. Oct. 28,.. 1975: About 2:30 a.m. police patrolman R. P. of Campbell County, KY, also saw two UFOs while driving on a highway.. He said one of the objects was on his left, the other to his right and that he was driving between them \"very close\"! The UFOs made no sound,, he said. Oct.. 2-9, 1975: In evening, S.R., a boy 15 years of age, was walking home after selling candy for a school benefit. Suddenly a UFO, shaped like a \"beer can,\" appeared about 25 ft. overhead. On top was a white light with rotating red lights on the bottom. The UFO made no sound and after hover- ing for about 20 seconds, it shot .straight up into sky. S.R. came home frightened, tried to relate his sighting to unsympa- thetic parents. He called the police, who gave the boy my phone number. I was not avail- able. The next' day S. .R. left a \"runaway\" note on the kitchen table, 'in which he expressed great agonizing fears of the UFO and said that he knew that the UFO was after him. He signed his note with love and promised to call when he was safe. The father, J.R., who had been in touch with the police, called me in his con- fusion over his son's behavior and the UFO. He said his son withdrew $500 from his bank ac- count and was missing. The next day, the boy was apprehended by security police Page 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"at the Atlanta airport. He was brought home and before retir- ing from fatigue asked to call me. He was incoherent and still frightened. He admitted that he was still shaking in fear of the UFO. I have since had several talks with S. R. and he has re- lated the root of his fears. One year ago, in Oct., 1974, he witnessed a UFO with portholes in his high school yard at tree top level. This frightened the boy, and while in bed that same night he\"said he experienced a dream or in a trance-like state, saw an unhuman, oval- shaped head with oval eyes and wrinkled skin that had no nose, and a slit for a mouth before him.

On Oct. 26, 1975, S.R. saw a disc-shaped UFO come in- low • over his house. ''The bottom,\" he said, \"was dull reddish black and was divided into squares like graph paper.\" Then on Oct. 29, S. R. had his final experience with the \"beer can\" UFO. Nov. 4, 1975: About 6:45 in Ross, OH, six witnesses in car spotted UFO hovering at tree top level. It was cylinder- shaped, about 75 feet in di- ameter with blue, green and red rotating lights. Square win- dows were observed. While the UFO hovered over a wooded area it started into a spinning mo- tion; a small glowing red ball of light, about 3 feet in dia- meter was ej ected out of the bottom. The car's engine and lights went out. After the red ball disap- peared, the witnesses were shocked to see \"landing gear,\" glowing blue, come out of the bottom of the UFO, which ap- peared to land in a wooded area. When the object vanished from sight, the car's engine started, as did all the \"woodsy insect\" sounds which had stop- ped, according to witnesses. Nov. 10, 1975: About 6:30 p.m. two gas station attendants in Ross, OH, saw a large steady glowing white light in the sky about five times larger than the brightest star. The UFO moved toward the station and \"blinked out.\" When the UFO disappeared, both attendants smelled the strong odor of sul- phur. Also a motorist driving in for gas also remarked about the strong, offensive odor. During this period, investi- gators in Greater Cincinnati have recorded 16 individual re- ports of \"unexplainable\" noc- turnal lights in the sky. Some reports indicate \"close up\" lights, which are not included in this Preliminary Report, as questionnaires have not been returned. Most of the reports, in my opinion, have celestial or other conventional explana- tions. Missouri By Ted Phillips Date of sighting: Nov. 28, 1975, 0500 (CST). Location: Sedalia, MO. Witness: Mrs. Carol K., age 23. I received the following re- port during a conversation with the witness on Dec. 1, 1975. The witness called me on Nov. 30, 1975. She has not reported the event to the news media. No additional witnesses have been found to date. The witness is a high school graduate, very intelligent, and seeks no pu- blicity. The following is taken, in part, from a taped interview at the home of the witness. Mrs. K: I was sleeping and I heard the door close (her husband leaving on a hunting trip) and I got up and went through the house. I wanted to be sure the door sound was my husband leaving. Suddenly, I heard a weird, kind of like thunder or rumbling noise. It changed right away to a kind of buzzing like electricity. The dog started barking and growl- ing, and the other dogs in the neighborhood were barking. I looked out the kitchen window-- our dog was running in circles and really growling. Phillips: Were the dogs barking before you heard the sound? Mrs. K: No. Phillips: What happened after you heard the sound? Mrs. K: I went to the front window and saw this weird look- ing star (N-5°, 25° above the horizon) with a circle around it. A kind of blue-green halo. It was getting bigger and brighter and you could see the greenish-blue color around it sort of like a circle. The center was just white, real bright and perfectly round. The circle around it wasn't as Page 6"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Animal reaction noted woman reports close sighting bright.

It stopped there for may- be 2 or 3 minutes. Phillips: Did it wobble? Mrs. K: No, it was steady. After it stopped for a short time, it moved between these two trees (140 ft away) and tilted up and L could see part of the bottom. I could see street lights reflected on the bottom. The surface looked PHASE 1 .STREET DII-.KED UG!!T \\ / WITNESS like metal; it was silver with the little red lights and the big red ones. I could see a white top (dome) and /three cir- cles in the white. There was something, like a black, cross at the back.

Phillips: Could you,see light coming through the bubbles? Mrs. K: No, they were' out- lined on the white.

Mrs. K: Yes, one light in the kitchen; it dimmed several times and that street light seemed to get dim also. Phillips: Did the sound con- tinue during the sighting?

The object made a low pass below the trees and stopped for a short time very near the ground and about 40 feet from the witness. The ob- ject ascended vertically and disappeared. The witness was alone and became quite fright- ened. She called a relative to come and stay with her. No traces were found. On Dec., 7, 1975, at 0230, at Sedalia, MO., a single wit- ness (male, 37 years old) ob- served a bright blue-white globe to the south as he was driving east on 16th street on the east side of Sedalia. The object appeared to pace the automobile for a short time, accelerated and moved ahead. Witness attempted to follow the object until he arrived at the end of 16th street. The object dropped toward the ground and hovered briefly about 20 feet above ground level near a barn. The witness stopped his car and watched as the object moved a- way toward the east. At the close point the witness claimed he could see three \"windows\" on a dome. Rotating lights were also seen near the center of the object. These two cases and several others are being checked at this time. During the past two months there have been at least eight reports in the Sedalia area, and rumors of several ad- ditional reports."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"'Breaking the ice' Ft. Smith Conference reviewed by Pitts By Bill Pitts Director, Ft. Smith UFO Conference Editor Dwight Connelly very kindly has offered me an oppor- tunity to discuss various as- pects of the recent Fort Smith UFO Conference in general—and his \"critique\" in particular (see October SKYLOOK). First, I would like to take this opportunity to thank SKY- LOOK for . advance notices of the, then, forth-coming confer- ence, and express my apprecia- tion to,the many MUFON members attending—along with the di- rectors and members of all the other UFO organizations of note. As Editor Connelly so aptly noted, three out of four direc- tors of the main UFO organiza- tions in attendance at the con- ference is an exceptional feat. John Acuff of NICAP did not. at- tend, but I respect- his reasons for not doing so. Breaking the Ice Since this was the first ef- fort toward bringing all per- sons interested in the UFO phe- nomenon together in a combined meeting, I am very pleased at the response. I am not complet- ely happy, , nor content, with the conference, but, as one person attending said, \"The conference as a whole was well worth the time and effort. Per- haps it broke the ice. Here's looking forward to the day of the thaw!\" Mankind, in it's best estate, is subject, to many errors, trials, and tribulations. It became evident at the confer- ence that not everyone would be in complete agreement. Open animosity between directors of two of the UFO organizations proved how men, in search for authority,, show that they can- not cope with certain situa- tions--in this case, even open cooperation. As the chairman-director of the conference, I started to comment on this before the en- tire group in attendance, but considered that everyone was intelligent enough to draw his own conclusions. I stated at the conference, and do so again --the problem of the UFO phe- nomenon is greater than any in- dividual, or group, professing an interest in it, and that it behooves each of us to conduct ourselves in a friendly spirit toward each other so that UFO investigations do not become bogged down with human conceit, and deceit. Charles Hickson's Role Regarding .Hickson's not tak- ing a polygraph examination at the conference, I can only state that it is up to Hickson to prove that he had such an experience--and not up to any UFO investigator. After all, regardless of the amount of in- vestigating after the fact, or what any of us may believe a- bout Hickson or another alleged \"contactee,\" the \"burden of proof\" is on them. Hickson had been invited to attend on a general basis in my first letter to him, because I did not know exactly how to contact him or, indeed,, whether I would even hear from him. After he called me; answering my request that he do so, I stipulated that he was being invited with-the express stip- ulation that he receive a poly- graph examination during the conference, and to which he agreed. \" He mentioned this fact to the National Star reporter in a story which later appeared in the Aug. 26 issue. Hickson, in the same article, is quoted as being the \"focal point\" of the conference, and that he (Hick- son) would \"detail three new UFO sightings before a world body of scientists\" at the con- ference. This all turned out to be public-relations material for Hickson, and it was only at the moment I was to take Hickson for the Polygraph examination that he told me that he could not take it—for the reason that the \"climate\" was not right. It is my interpretation that the \"climate\" was going to be too hot, and Hickson repeat- ed to one of the newspaper re- porters that the polygraph ex- amination may tend to discredit his initial experience and hurt the sales of his forth-coming book. In this, I believe that Hick- son is telling us something he did not intend to let out.. Dr. James Harder told me at the conference that,he had not, at Pascagoula, placed Hickson into a deep trance; thus, we now have the information that the hypnotic session .(according to Hickson's own promotion ma- terial) is not any more conclu- sive than was the polygraph ex- amination in New Orleans. I will leave Charles Hickson to those who choose to believe him. The other person at the con- ference , and who did receive a polygraph examination, failed his exams--but is happier be- cause of it. He was not trying to gain publicity, and, in fact, is shunning it. This person believes that he had the experience, back in 1953, but has been hoping that it did not happen. His testimony has more information than did Hickson's, and I am obtaining additional information from him.

The • reason Hickson was placed on Friday night's program was a part of a progressive program that I hop- ed to build from--knowing that other speakers would be refer- ring to the Pascagoula inci- dent . It was not possible to have all the speakers at the most convenient moment for all at- tending, and we had to start somewhere. All but two of the speakers were- from invitations only. Two of them contacted me and asked to be on the program, manely Stanton Friedman and William Spaulding, both of whom added much to the conference. Also, since many UFO reports do relate to radar, I wanted to get this portion of the pro- gramming at' an early spot, so that those attending would un- derstand what radar is and what it is not. It must be remembered, too, that not everyone attending the conference had attended any other UFO meeting, or sympos- ium, so it was important for them to see, and hear, all the basics--as well as the direc- tors of the UFO organizations represented. Personally, I could have sat through the entire week-end just listening to Dr. Hynek, an honest, learned person who has my deepest respect. To me, a real \"sleeper\" was Dewey Four- net, who probably has more real background on the flying saucer UFO experience than anyone liv- ing- -with the exception of Dr. Hynek. The workshop sessions were not originally scheduled for the program. A phone call from Mark Chesney, of the Center for UFO Studies, assured me that these sessions would add im- measurably to the conference and were a \"must.\" Thus, I placed Mark in charge of these sessions. While he was at the conference he became ill, and I did not see him until Sunday Page 10 noon, after the conference was over. Those participating in the workshop sessions, however, did manage to \"carry the ball,\" and received much interest from those attending the sessions. Other Factors The \"after hour\" parties were \"split\" due to a motion picture crew, and others, staying at another motel, . approximately three miles from the headquar- ters motel. There was nothing we could do about this division of persons. For those who chose to turn in early, the 8 a.m. session was no.problem. No one knew it was early any more than did I; however, again, • we had to start, and stop, sometime.• The program was very full, : and it was my contention . that those attending could sleep when they returned to their respective homes. An area at the headquarters motel was available for meet- ings, and just general getting together,, throughout the week- end. This was announced on more than one occasion by me, and if no-one was interested in util- izing the facilities, it was not for me to make them do so. There are many aspects of the conference planning I could tell you about. You may, or may not, be surprised at. how many times I had to change the tentative schedules because one speaker would not appear just before, or just after, another. Some would not appear on any type of panel, if another was going to be .on the panel. This is the human element. I had to make decisions, how- ever, because I not only insti- gated the idea for the confer- ence, but I was the only person working on it and getting it all together. I had to reach some decisions for the final program--arid did sb--not to the entire liking of those partici- pating—not even to my own. Frankly, only I am to blame for any improper placement, or scheduling, of the program material. I hope that the conference, if there was anything at all good gained from it, will let others in the future remember what to do, and what not to do. I wish I could tell you of the persons who called, or wrote, about UFO experiences and who wanted to be on the program; those who contacted me to ad- vise that aliens from other planets exist .in the mountains of Kentucky 1 and that they would give me some \"signs\" prior to the conference; of occult-psy- chic overtones, and some re- ligious, arising from \"dreams\" persons were having and which » had taken them to other plan- ets, during their dreams, and -•• they wanted to tell the scien- •«> tists 'attending about these \"dreams.\" These, and others, became almost an everyday phone call and/or letter. Dr. Hynek had asked me how . we were going to keep away the \"kooks,\" --and I assured him that there were probably some, in the UFO organ- izations—maybe, even on the program. His question, really interested me, however, and showed that, the UFO phenomenon had- \"come a long way, baby-- when .\"flying saucer\" fans were wondering how to keep away \"kooks.\" This became an amusing aspect of it all to me—especially at times when I wished I had never thought of having such a con- ference. Dr. Hynek's question pulled me through some other- wise discouraging moments. Be- lieve me, it is one thing to '?>' hear about a meeting--to sit back and enjoy it--and another *' thing to worry about the pro- *1 graming of it. Future Conferences I have much material for other conferences, should they ever be held. I'would change some of the format, if I had anything to do with another, not because I think I was wrong on this one, but know that the human mind can absorb just so much—and, then, it is nice to get away .from it all, for a time, anyway."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"A closed book or a new one? By Joe Brill For the past several years I have endeavored to present to the readers of SKYLOOK magazine the documented facts on the ob- servations of Unidentified Fly- ing Objects over the Soviet Union and the communist nations of Eastern Europe. To those who have read the facts of the cases presented in the past years, it is obvious that these areas of,our world are as fre- quently visited by UFO's as is the rest of the world. I have arrived at the point with this regular column where I believe it should cease. And so, this article will be the final installment of informa- tion to show that not only do UFO's frequently appear over the Soviet territories, but that some scientists consider these observations as 'scienti- fically important. On June 24, 1975, Doctor Fe- lix U. Zigel. wrote'to me that he had completed Part 2 of \"Ob- servations of UFO's in the USSR,\" but that it would be \"impossible\" to transmit .this completed work to me at this time. Dr. Zigel expressed his de- sire to be of a greater assis- tance, but stated, \"Unfortun- ately, not all depends on me and I can do only what is in my power personally for the devel- opment of a fruitful, scienti- fic cooperation between the USSR and American research con- cerning the UFO phenomenon.\" He also made special mention to \"send niy best wishes to Mr. Walter Andrus for his efforts in this field.\" ' Since this letter of June 24 I have not received any re- sponse from Dr. Zigel to my letters of inquiry as to the authenticity of the recent NATIONAL ENQUIRER . feature story, which directly quoted him and related several ac- Sightings in the USSR Dr. Felix Zigel counts which I had not pre- viously heard of. It now ap- pears that the curtain of si- lence has again been drawn on Dr. Zigel and his research on UFO's in the Soviet Union. In addition to the letter of June 24, Dr. Zigel enclosed a \"Prospectus\" on a book en- titled \"INTERPLANETARY VEHICLES AND UFO's\" of which he is the author. This was dated June 25. He indicated that any in- terested American publisher should write directly .to: Ail- Union Agency for Author's Rights, Lavrushinsky per. D. 17, Moscow. 109017, marking it to the , attention of Boris Mik- hailovich Zatsepin. Dr. Zigel was hopeful that some American publisher would be interested . in publishing such a manuscript. The follow- ing is the translation of the Prospectus for Dr. Zigel's com- pleted work: Prospectus In the new PROGRAM OF IN- VESTIGATION OF PROBLEMS CON- CERNING EXTRATERRESTRIAL CIVIL- IZATIONS . of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR (1974), on page 19 there is a point con- cerning interplanetary vehic- les, where the following is stated: \"Special attention should be devoted to the discovery of ve- hicles of extraterrestrial civ- ilizations that may be found in the solar system or in orbit a- round the Earth. For such a search for quickly moving ob- jects, the system of continuous surveillance of all the heavens must be supplemented by creat- ing a special radio directional bearing system. In the initial stage, use could possibly be made of the already existing complexes intended for cosmic link-ups and.radio location.\" Thus, the search for extra- terrestrial and interplanetary vehicles in orbit around the Earth has become- a serious topic of scientific investiga- tion in connection with extra- terrestrial civilizations. Clearly, among these vehicles are those that are able to de- scend into the Earth's atmos- phere or even to accomplish a landing on the Earth's surface for a complete collection of desired information. In connection with this, there is now a need for books which examine on a highly con- temporary scientific and tech- nical level, but in sufficient- ly popular form, the interstel- lar problems involved, the pos- sible forms of construction and other parameters of inter- planetary vehicles, and in par- ticular the propulsion systems. These questions, in the mean- time, are unfortunately scanti- ly treated in scientific liter- ature—as -is also the case for the methods for discovery and study of interplanetary vehic- les. I offer a book that should fill this vacuum. In the first section of it, the problems of direct contacts among civiliza- tions of the Cosmos will be ex- tensively examined. Also, civ- Page 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"ilizations on a higher level than civilizations here on Earth, for cosmic flights probably utilize cosmic mass- energy resources in full mea- sure externally (that is, not provided on board cosmic ships); then, in the book there will be a detailed examination of possible earthly energy for cosmic flights in the future. In particular, electrostatic, electromagnetic and quantum flight .systems will be subjec- ted to critical analysis. It is proposed to survey the problems of \"anti-gravity\" and reception of energy from a physical vac- uum and of utilizing them to power vehicles for a measured distance. In connection with this, it is proposed to analyze possible forms of construction of inter- planetary vehicles and their physical characteristics. In- dividual attention' will be given to methods of discovering interplanetary - vehicles in the neighborhood of the Earth and in the Earth's atmosphere. There has to be reported anew the 'search for interplanetary vehicles and the problems of \"flying saucers\" . or UFO's. In this book there will be de- tailed a basic new method of studying reports of UFO's that will permit screening out er- roneous' observations when ball lightning, optical phenomena in the atmosphere, or apparatus maintained from Earth are.taken for interplanetary . vehicles. It is proposed to explain in detail the methods of revealing various counterfeit and false reports relating to UFO's. In this book there will be given in detail an account of the investigations of UFO's ob- served in the USSR, in particu- lar of the celebrated Tungus UFO of the year 1908. Since the UFO phenomenon extends over an important range in time and in all historical periods, I propose to examine, excepting analysis of contemporary UFO's, such remarkable UFO's of the past (for example, the so- called \"Kirillid wave\" of 1913). (I would imagine Dr. Page 12 Mushrooms, other traces reported Zigel is referring to the UFO flap which lasted for three weeks in January of 1913 over Dover, Cardiff, Newport and Neath, England. The \"London Standard\" of Jan 31, 1913, pub- lished a list of the towns from which unknown flying objects were sighted by local citizens. J.B.) The principal aim of the book is to give the reader a rigidly scientific approach to the problems of the study of UFO's and to uncover falsifi- cations and unscientific ab- surdities having to do with \"flying saucers.\" Such a book should prevent the spread of pseudo-scientific, sensational stories about serious problems of the search for interplane- tary vehicles and at the same time attract scientific work- ers from all countries to ser- ious study of this theme. The book will be useful on all themes that concern prob- lems of cosmic flight and pro- pulsion systems for the future. In a supplement to the book will be given a complete cata- logue of communications re- ceived concerning the observa- tions of UFO's over the USSR.\" Date of possible sighting: April 20,1975.

April 24 Edition Yesterday morning two tech- nicians from the National High- way Department who work as in- spectors for the Benito Roggio S.A. (Incorporated), which is building the stretch of road from Jachal to Zanja de Dona Julia, on the route to Rodeo, visited our correspondent in the city of the north. They reported to him that some children had consulted them Monday as to whether during the preceding night they had been working on the side of some hills located opposite the Pachimoco dam at some one hund- red meters south of the provin- cial school Bienvenida Sarmi- ento, which is located in the place, and at about ten kilome- ters from the plaza San Martin in Jachal. The technicians, Raul Marquez and Vicente Monfrinotti, answered the children in the negative, since on Sunday night nobody worked on the road, least of all on the side of the nearby hills. \"But our curiosity was a- roused, said Marquez, \"and we went to make an inspection of the area, where we had the great surprise of encountering a series of marks and circum- stances which would indicate the landing of a UFO.\" Immediately and accompanied by Marquez and Monfrinotti .and by the Jachal superintendent, Sr. Jesus de la Cruz Vidable, as well as by cameramen from the local press, our represent- ative went to the place, which had been the site of the al- leged landing. The place is located as we indicated above, on the side of a hill and is almost in the backyard of the Vienvenida Sar- miento School, or better said a few meters from it. It involves a hard, rocky terrain. At the"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"site were found the tracks of the bases, or landing pads, of a tripod or something of that nature. The mark of said bases indicates a perfect equilateral triangle having a distance of exactly four meters one from the other, and each track mea- suring thirty centimeters in diameter. The ground where each one of the three bases of the tripod settled, in which there re- mained a mark of approximately one centimeter in depth, is found completely burned, dark- ened by the heat. In the center of the triangle marked by said tracks can be seen a large patch of soot or smoke like that which remains after the burning of gun powder, there being found completely scorched some small plants of arum and of \"core\" which are in that place. On touching, the rocks which have been stained (by the soot) soil the fingers with something like soot. Around the three marks of the bases of the supposed tripod were some enormous mushrooms, which amount to seven all'told. The caps of some measure some twenty centimeters in di- ameter, and the stems measure some seven'centimeters. As we said, the area is com- pletely dry, of rocky soil, where the last thing one could expect to find growing is mush- rooms, which normally appear in places with much . moisture. Proof of this statement is the fact that in the immediate sur- roundings there does not exist a single plant of this type which in a strange and suspic- ious number appear at the site of the possible landing. Yesterday when our corres- pondent was at the place where the mushrooms appeared it seemed that the strong wind on Monday had uprooted them from the site where they originally were since they were found half dried. In general terms the impres- sion which has been left with those who have visited the site is that without any doubt some unidentified flying object landed there, since the marks of the tripod would so indi- cate. Also, the scorching of the plants, .the patch like burnt gun powder on the ground, the existence of mushrooms in a totally unheard of place, and the appearance of lights at a place and at a time inappropri- ate. Our correspondent in Jachal has presented the news of this event to the authorities of the Police District twenty-one, whose head, Chief Sixto Carba- jal, immediately went to the site, . taking proper steps to insure that the found traces should not be erased by the public which had begun to visit the place. April 25 Edition Just as we indicated in our article yesterday, the possible appearance of flying .saucers in Jachal has awakened a true ex- citement in the area,- where a great number of the people have paraded incessantly through the place of the supposed landing so that, it has been coverted into a center of true attrac- tion. The most important news on the case is given by the cir- cumstance that the authorities of police district twenty-one have collected the mushrooms and samples of the rocks and burned ground, which have been sent to the Space Experimenta- tion Station of Chamical in the Province of La Rioja, so that they might duly analyze them. On Wednesday afternoon the mushrooms collected at Pachimo- co were examined at the head- quarters of district twenty-one by an agricultural engineer who, after minute examination of the mushrooms, reported not knowing of such a species and showed his astonishment at the extraordinary size of the same, the diameter of the cap on one of them reaching twenty-two centimeters. April 28 Edition The carrying out of a hoax enters into all the possibil- ities. With the purpose of establishing whether, in the area of the Pachimoco dike, there are other mushrooms like those found at the site of the presumed landing, our repre- sentative in Jachal visited the site yesterday and talked about this matter with the person in charge of the dike, Mr. Julio Balmaceda, who has filled this position for 9 years, . but dur- ing this time he never saw mushrooms of this size nor any small ones. This discards the possibility that they were cut in the surrounding area and carried to the site where they were found. On the other hand Mr. Marquez and Mr. Monfrinotti indicated that when they discovered the traces at the site, outside of these there were no signs of human tracks belonging to those who could have been the authors of the joke. When our representative was at the Pachimoco dike yesterday he met Nestor Simon in passing, accompanied by his family. His wife, Mrs. Juana Ontiveros de Siman, told that approximately 20 days ago, when she was iron- ing in her home, located in the district of El Fical, 17 km. from the Pachimoco dike, she was called by shouts to the patio by her daughter, Juana Beatriz, 11 years old. - When she went there, the daughter showed her a light to the west which illuminated the area with a sky blue color, while it remained rocking for 5 minutes, more or less, until it descended sharply in the area near the Pachimoco dike. This same spectacle, said Mr. Siman and his wife, repeated itself days later. Several neighbors of the western sector of Florida street indicated that on Fri- day, April 25, around 8 p.m., they saw something \"like a ball of light\" which remained oscil- lating for 8 minutes, also at the height of the Pachimoco dike, finally to disappear leaving a tenuous cloud in its place.

Investigated by: Organization of Tandil for the Investigation of .Extraterrestrial Phenomenon (OTIFE). Submitted by: Jorge A. Bruno, director of OTIFE, through Joe Brill. Translated by: Dr. Willard Armstrong. .The plunging of the city of Tandil, Argentina, into dark- ness at 4:05 a.m. and the al- leged observation of a UFO hit- ting a power line at the same time are two of the ingredients in the strange case .involving Sebastian. Ac'evedo. At .approximately 3:45 a.m. Acevedo, 35, began, his -usual walk to work, leaving the hum- ble hut of clay and cardboard ' where he lived with his wife and three children on the out- skirts of Tandil. Having barely completed the first grade, Ace- vedo' is semi-illiterate,' and his major goal in life has been to obtain a! bicycle with which to travel to work at a grain processing factory in Tandil. Having walked slightly more than three blocks through pat- ches of fog arid the cool night air, Acevedo looked into the sky and saw a luminous point which seemed to fall. He des- cribed it a's \"a star which was coming down I\" An Intense Light He gave little attention to this, supposing it was a mete- orite or \"something similar.\" He had walked about 15 feet farther when a powerful light shown from behind him. He sup- posed it was an auto, so he stepped to the right to get off the pavement. At the same time he turned his 'head toward the light. He then noted that the light was coming from some sort of machine in the air which had apparently approached at a -high rate of speed, and at that in- stant had stopped over his Page 14 head. The machine made a tre- mendous noise, according to Acevedo, similar to \"one thou- sand welding machines.\" The machine was about eight feet in diameter and was shoot- ing off \"possibly six or seven\" flames from its edges. The de- vice now opened its underside and a red beam of light covered Acevedo, totally paralyzing him. '.'I wanted to call for help, but I could not,\" he explains. \"I wanted to run, but I could not. I felt a very strong pain in my chest as' 1 if my heart was paralyzed. While that thing was there it lifted me, twice, to above thirty to forty centi- meters (12-16 inches) off the ground.\" Acevedo said he was lifted very slowly, \"as if it wanted to suck me in,\" and that he was drawn very close to the object: \"I am sure that if I. had been able to move my arms I could have touched it.\" He said that the object rose as he rose. Acevedo said the obj ect gave off intense heat \".like that of an oven .like those that are in the steel mills.\" The opening on the underside of the object was described as being about half the size of the \"machine\" and \"it opened like those doors in the western saloons in the movies.\" The light . which came through the opening was \"very strong and Coming down as though enclosed or restrained. Here it was and suddenly it ended. It was not like the beams from spotlights which you don't know where they end.\" Saved by Watchman? At this moment the watchman at a nearby factory came out shouting, \"What's going on.\" Acevedo believes this saved him from being abducted by the ob- ject. The watchman, Juan Reyes, said he was, frightened because he thought a transformer locat- ed at the entrance of his fac- tory (Tandilera De Magriasco, manufacturer of cheeses and candles) had caught on fire. The watchnan observed the great luminosity, but did not see the object, .since only Acevedo could be observed after Reyes opened the factory gate. Ace- vedo was .reportedly observed turning around in circles in the-middle of the street. Another indirect witness was the manager of the factory,, who lives in the factory building. He says he heard the noise and was aware of the illumination, but attributed it to trucks coming to load merchandise. He did not realize that the time was 4 a.m.. rather than the 6 a. m. time scheduled . for such loading. The manager's son al- so observed the illumination and heard the noise. Immediately following the encounter, Acevedo said he was \"very dizzy and I was very thirsty indeed. I was sweating, I am certain, because of the heat which that thing gave off.\" He said the manager took him to the main office, where he had to tell what had hap- r pened. \"I.did not want to. I had to go to work. I was very nervous, but I had to go to work. I am a poor man .and no one hands out money.\" Followed Power Lines Acevedo said that the object moved straight up as it left him, then banked at • an angle, following along and above the. power lines until it reached the highway (where the power lines cables cross Route 226). \"There.it collided .with some- thing,\" said Acevedo, \"some cable or something else, be- cause the .light became much brighter after it rose up a"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Possible kidnaping by UFO averted by youth EDITOR'S NOTE: The following ac- count appeared some years ago in Gene Duplantier's magazine SAUCERS, SPACE, AND SCIENCE. It is interesting in view of the recent Travis Walton case (January SKYLOOK) and the 1974 Tandil, Argentina, case (this issue). The sketch accompanying this story is by Duplantier. This account was provided by Joe Brill. This incident took place in Thompson, Manitoba, Canada, sometime between June 15 and June 30 of 1967. It occurred at 6 p.m. and was seen for three or four minutes by Mr. and Mrs. D. F. LeMarquands, three of their children, four neighbors and two other chil- dren. Mrs. LeMarquands had just entered the house when she heard a beeping noise at about one second intervals. Looking out the window, she saw dirt and debris moving rapidly a- round ! the house in a circular pattern. Upon going outside, she saw her husband who had just driven into the yard. He and the five children were staring up into the sky. At first, only dust and dirt, moving in a vortex, could be seen. But then Mrs. LeMarquands was able to see the object which was causing the distur- bance. She described the object as being large and shaped much like a pack of cigarettes, al- though she later commented that it might have been cube-shaped. It was revolving counter clockwise and appeared to have alternating shiny aluminum and black sides as it moved. It had no apparent openings or lights, and it was now dead silent. As she watched the object, Mrs. LeMarquands was distracted by a scuffling sound and she looked to the ground to see a 13-year-old boy from across the street pinning down her 8-year- old daughter. At this time the object started moving off at a forty-five-degree angle, lev- elled off, hovered, and then left on a level course towards the southeast. Mrs. LeMarquands' attention was then drawn toward the chil- dren, all of whom were visibly shaken, except her 8-year-old daughter. The whirlwind had stopped, and the little girl was now standing by herself. The other children were even- tually sufficiently calm enough to relate that their 8-year-old playmate had risen into the air towards the slowly revolving object. The 13-year-old boy had grabbed her when she was about three feet off the ground. The children reported that the little girl's skirt, blouse, and hair had ridden straight up her body when she was rising. When asked if she could re- member anything, the girl re- plied that she could remember nothing from the instant the wind started until she stood up. Mrs. LeMarquands further re- ported that all the debris that had been blown up had been dropped in a yard across the street as the object moved off. She also stated that the \"wind\" had revolved around their home only, without touching either of the neighboring homes nor the grass outside the \"circle.\" \"It was almost as though a huge glass container had been placed over them, the area in- volved was so exact,\" Mrs. Le- Marquands reported. bit.\" Street lights which had been burning were off when Acevedo went into the factory with the manager, he said. The Buenos Aires Electric Company's sub- station is located about 1800 feet beyond the highway where the object appeared to collide with something. The time was 4:05 a.m., according to the watchman's watch. At this time the city of Tandil had just been plunged into darkness. An investigation, of the area later revealed that one of the 13,200 volt cables carrying power to Tandil had been cut at the point where Acevedo noted the intense flash of light as the object left him. The cable had fallen to the pavement at the intersection of Route 226. This corresponds with Ace- vedo 's report that the last thing he saw was a fire running along the high tension wires in the direction of the electric company's substation located 1800 feet beyond Route 226. OTIFE investigators concluded that the UFO had made contact with the cable going to the substation, causing an excess of voltage which caused the im- mediate breakdown and fire in a Page 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"transormer in the substation. Electric company technicians could not explain why the seven automatic relays at the step- down substation did not operate properly to protect the sub- station. The substation at Tan- dil suffered the complete des- .truction of.feeder 104 and sec- tion 4 of feeder 105, as well as fire damage. Damage was estimated at two million pesos, and the report of the incident was classified as secret by authorities. The. official cause of the cable break was listed as wind, even though the cable was brok- en .between towers,.and the wind that night was blowing a,t only 13 to 15 kilometers per hour (8-9 mph). Additional Sightings Jn checking the Acevedo case, OTIFE investigators found other witnesses who said they had ob- served three luminous discs above the mountains at 11 p.m.. on the night of April 13, a few hours prior to the : Acevedo in- cident . A resident of Tandil and his family were reportedly witness- es just after midnight on April .14 to a red UFO over one of the low hill's of Tandil which caused- interference on their TV set.. A woman reportedly observed at 3:45 a.m. on April 14 an in- tense reddish light -which sur- rounded her house in a Tandil suburb. The light reportedly came from a circular obj ect which left at a high rate of speed without making any sound. A taxi driver who had taken the woman home shortly before her sighting confirmed seeing the red glow, but he had not seen the object. Two men traveling from Tandil to Olavarria in the early hours of the morning of April 14 re- portedly saw at a point 14 ki- lometers (8% miles) from Tandil a \"being of low statue\" on the side of the road, which ap- peared to have no face. Their auto was then illuminated on the inside with a very bright white light, they said. Page 16 High speed 100-degree turn Commercial pilot Date of sighting: July 6, 1975, 1700- 1730 (EOT). Location: 30 nautical miles NNW of the Wilkes-Barre, PA, VOR stations. Investigated by: Raymond E. Fowler, MUFON director of investigations. Type of sighting: daylight disc by com- mercial pilot. Sighting Background On or about Sept. 13, 1975, I received a telephone call from Allegheny Airlines Flight Captain Robert L. Hobson, who informed me of a UFO sighting made by a friend, an Allegheny Airlines flight captain and his co-pilot (who prefers not to file a report). Captain Hobson knew of me because of a per- sonal UFO sighting that was re- layed to me via the FAA. I mailed a letter and a Form 1 to Captain X requesting him to fill it out and return it to me. Sighting Description (Transcribed from \"Personal Account\" Form 1) \"I was about 30 nautical miles NNW of the Wilkes-Barre VOR, in the captain's seat of a BAG 111 turbojet, at an alti- tude of 17,000 feet, eyeballing a line of thunderstorms that lay across our normal route of flight. The storms lay in a NE-SW line, the SW end of the line ending in the Wilkes-Barre area, and the line running NE as far as I could see, and the radar painted it all the way across the tube on the 60-mile scale.  • - \"The closest storm lay at about our 10 to 11 o'clock po- sition and the radar showed a significant rain gradient, and lightning was visible 'to the eye. We were operating in clear air (with) good visibil- ity and cloudless skies above and behind us. Our heading was about SSE. . \"At the time we saw the disk, the closest .storm was about 20 nautical miles (from us) on the radar and the disk was some- where between us and the storm.' My First Officer and I saw the disk at about the same time., We both watched it intently. \"The airplane was on auto-, pilot and we? were closing on the object. Our airspeed was about 300 kts.

His description of 1/3 the di- ameter of the full moon on Form 1 is a better estimate for the object's apparent size when closest to the aircraft. Interview and Interrogation Upon receipt and study of the signed Form 1, I phoned the witness on Oct. 2, 1975, and went over the Form-1 with him to assure its accuracy. The following additional informa- tion resulted from this conver- sation. 1) Accurate apparent size was 1/3 full moon's diameter, not 1\" at arm's length. 2) Object's 100-degree turn ruled out a balloon in his estimation. 3) Object's 100-degree turn and maneuver into thunderstorm clouds coincided with his radio enquiry to New York Air Traffic Control as to whether they had a target in that area. 4) Air Traffic Controller broke off contact abruptly when witness told him by radio that --\"Whoever is inside that 'thing' is going to get the ride of his life\" --when it entered. the thunderstorm clouds. 5) The BAG 111 aircraft's radar was not fine-tuned enough to pick up the UFO at that dis- tance unless the antenna was pointing directly at the UFO. Even so, the target size would be small and probably would be lost in the signal noise on the screen. The radar is designed for weather targets. 6) It is possible that the object was masked from ground radar because of its close Page 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"proximity to the thunderstorm clouds. On Oct. 8, 1975, I mailed Captain X a scaled drawing of the UFO sighting event. On it, I. noted . the farthest and closest positions of the air- craft to the thunderstorm clouds during the UFO sighting period. I asked him to sketch in the UFO's\"' relative position and flight path: to divide the UFO flight path into two legs (A - B and B - C) intersected by the 100-degree plus turn; and, to denote the estimated flight duration time of each segment. (See sketch.) On or about Oct. 27, 1975, I again phpned the witness to re- mind him to send the requested data to me. I'asked him to carefully consider the accuracy of his initial three-minute sighting duration, estimate. When I received the requested annotated sketch, I noted that he had revised the UFO sighting time duration from 3 minutes to 2 minutes and 45 seconds. Additional Witness Check .The Co-Pilot elected not to file a. report; Natural Phenomena Check Only ball lightning would fit the description of the ob- served object in shape. How- ever, color, size, speed, maneuver and time-duration would seem to rule out ball lightning. Man-Made Object Check The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospher- ic Administration, Climatologi- cal Records, Washington, D.C. (A.C. 202/427-7919) informed me that weather balloons in that ancl other areas throughout the United States were launched only at OOOOZ and 1200Z (8 a.m. and 8 p.m. EOT). When I described the UFO event to this office, they were of the opinion that it was not any kind of a balloon. A check with the local National Weather Service branch in Boston, MA, confirmed these National Launch Times. I did not check out the possibility of an experimental research balloon as there would be too many possible launch sources-- colleges, universities, govern- ment projects, etc. Data seems to rule out any kind of balloon. See SIGHTING EVALUATION for pertinent data negating a balloon. Other Possibilities Caliber of the witness would rule out hoax or hallucination (shared with co-pilot?). Sighting Evaluation The object was 1/3 the appar- ent size of the full moon or a- bout .08 of an inch held at arm's length according to the witness. It was situated against clouds which radar in- dicated were 20 and then 7 nau- tical miles from the aircraft when the object was first and last seen. The object was mov- ing into the wind when first seen and executed more than a .100-degree turn before entering cloud cover. When observed it was sil- houetted against a line of clp.uds. Visibility around and between the aircraft and the clouds was unlimited. The ob- ject was observed for about 3 minutes (estimated 2 minutes, 45 seconds). The abrupt turn and disappearance into the thunderstorm clouds took only an estimated 5 seconds. The following negative fac- tors, based upon rough (but conclusive) calculations rule out the possibility that the object might have been a bal- loon if the witness' estimates are taken as being fairly ac- curate. These factors are based upon: the object's .08\" at arm's length apparent size; its esti- mated location and flight path in relation to the cloud line and- Approaching aircraft; the 300 nautical miles-per-hour speed of the oncoming aircraft; and, the estimated sighting time duration. Rough estimates indicate that the object would have had to be over 100 feet in diameter to displace an apparent diameter - of .08\" held at arm's length when the aircraft was at least 7 miles from it as judged by the known distance to the cloud cover it was silhouetted against when last observed. It would have had to be a very large balloon! , • Another point to consider in negating the balloon possibil- ity is the object's speed. If one takes the scaled UFO loca- . tion and flight path at face, value (See sketch), the UFO would have travelled 18 nauti- cal miles between Points A and B in 2 minutes and 40 seconds. This would place its speed at over 400 knots. Add to .the above data that the object was moving about di-. rectly into the wind and that it performed a fantastic plus 100-degree turn when its posi- tion was communicated via radio by the witness, and the balloon answer is very weak. The above reasoning coupled with the training of the wit- ness (es) cause me to place this UFO sighting in the unknown category. • 1975 MUFON SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS •(111'pages) The 1975 Proceedings is available from MUFON, 103 Oldtowne Rd., Sequin, Texas 78155 for $4.00 post- paid.

Witnesses: Frank Auman, Jr., Ashe- boro, NC, contractor, county commis- sioner, pilot; and Arlan Keith Andrews, MUFON engineering consultant. Type of sighting: brilliant white light in daylight. By Arlan Keith Andrews Frank Auman is an experienced pilot with over 2000 hours of flying time. While we were fly- ing enroute to Savannah on the referenced date, I asked whether he had ever seen UFOs while flying, since we are both interested in the problem. He said that he had once seen a brilliant white light near the horizon and that it had per- formed maneuvers and acted strangely enough to convince him that it had been a UFO. Within five or ten minutes of that conversation, we spotted a white light to our left (south- easterly, since we\" were heading southeast, ourselves--see map). We speculated on its being a satellite, but saw that it was below the clouds. We had had cloud reports from ground con- trollers that the clouds were at 20,000 feet, and our own al- titude was 4000 feet. At the time we were on IFR (instrument flight rules) and were flying over or parallel to Interstate 95 for safety's sake in case of engine failure. When we decided that the ob- ject probably was not an air- craft either—since there were no red or green lights, and the white light was not flashing, nor were any beacons visible— we looked at the time and our location--it was approximately 5:50 p.m. and we were about 15 miles north of Walterboro, SC, heading south. We continued to observe the light and it appeared to be angling slightly toward us (see estimated trajectory on accomp- anying map) and appeared as if we would pass close to it, as we continued on our own flight path. I picked up my 35 mm camera and prepared to take some photos of the light, but was waiting until it got brighter and closer, because having taken pictures of stars at night, I knew that a half- second exposure or more would be necessary to get a good image, and I didn't want blurred or elongated pictures if it were indeed a UFO. With the camera (SLR type) up to my eye I waited for the object to get closer. At about the time I decided that I had better get some kind of exposure just in case, the object made a slight wobble (it appeared to me), and made a hard left turn. It ac- celerated and within ten seconds had disappeared into the still-sunlit sky to our right. I did not take a pic- ture. It is important to note sev- eral facts here. First, there were never any other kinds of lights visible, so either the object glowed white all over, or (less likely, I imagine) a bright light was trained on us the whole time. Secondly, we saw that the object was under the clouds when the observation period be- gan. The sky was relatively dark under the clouds, as the sun had just set and there was only about a 10 or 15 degree band of sunlight near the hor- izon. As the object came across our projected flight path it entered into the lit portion of the sky and it was still bril- liant. Its intensity was very much brighter than Venus at its brightest, and the object steadily diminished in intensi- ty until it finally vanished in the light and haze over the horizon. There was no sudden disappearance. Upon landing at Savannah, we went for a weather briefing at the Weather Service, reported what we had seen, and they called Jacksonville Center. They related that there had been several UFO sightings (three was the word) during the time of our observation. They did not say whether this meant their own radar or simply vis- uals by other pilots. Information was also volun- teered that Fort Jackson, SC, was testing weapons that night, too. A map will show that Fort Jackson was about 75 miles to the north and west of our posi- tion at the time of our sight- ing. Furthermore, the object was always to the south of us. We both regretted that we had not had the presence of mind to ask the ground control- ler to look for another craft near us, during the sighting itself. Even UFO investigators do not always touch all bases during a sighting. I further regret not having taken even a blurry picture of a blob. The estimated elevation from the sighting vantage point was somewhere between 15 to 30 de- grees. A sketch is included to show the range of distances from us the object could have been. I feel that the limits were somewhere between 5 to 8 miles. 1975 trace report addition The following case was inad- vertently omitted from the listing of 1975 trace cases by Ted Phillips printed in the December issue: May 09 1975 Grafton, Aus- tralia. 15 ft circle with a width of 1% ft found, grass at center normal.

In one sense, I am extremely greatful to Lawrence David Kusche for the vast amount of research which he has obviously done in writing his book, THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE MYSTERY- SOLVED. Yet, in another sense, I feel he has gone a bit too far by rejecting anything and everything of an anomalous nature which has supposedly taken place in the, \"Tfiangle\" area. Kusche does show 'that many of the ship and plane dis- appearances have actually not occurred in the area which is usually designated as the \"Ber- muda Triangle.\" He also makes it clear that there has been a vast amount of nonsense writ- ten on this topic over the years. Even so, he provides no real solutions to several of the disappearances, rto matter;, where they occurred. Moreover , ' it is not merely the vanishing ships and planes which serve Co give the so-called \"Triangle\" an aura of mystery.
