St. Helens area of Washington State witnessed a daytime elk abduction. The preliminary report appeared in the MUFON UFO Journal of May 1999. The follow-up investigation re- veals additional details and corrects inaccuracies. For purposes of confidentiality, all witness names are pseudonyms. The preliminary investigation On a cold March afternoon with fresh snow up to their boot tops and a rolling valley before them, Peter Davenport (Director, National UFO Reporting Center) and Robert Fairfax (MUFON investigator) stood con- templating the account of an extraordinary event. Also at the edge of the bank stood Jack (landowner's repre- sentative) recounting details-albeit secondhand - of the incident witnessed by members of a crew of Hispanic forestry workers: a daytime elk abduction. As it turned out, Jack did not have all the particulars of the elk abduction correct, but we were not to find that out until much later. The 14 forestry workers could not plant seedling trees the Friday we arrived on site because ten inches of snow had fallen the previous night; therefore the crew had been given the day off. Hastily, an interview was arranged, through their em- ployer, with three of the witnesses that same afternoon. However, circumstances were not conducive to ob- taining an accurate and detailed report. The meeting took place in a deserted parking lot of a wayside cafe. The cacophony of rushing traffic saturated the back- ground, creating additional handicaps, since none of the three witnesses spoke more than a smidgen of En- glish. Add to this picture a chill to the air, a limited time before sunset, and the requirement of telling the story through their boss, Emanuel, as interpreter to get an idea of the situation. So here we were, seven of us, standing around the tailgate of a pickup truck for an extemporaneous in- vestigation. Conducting separate interviews was not a viable option. Even though group interviewing con- flicts with traditional investigative practice, we per- ceived little choice in the matter-we needed to take advantage of this opportunity. Fully aware of the pit- falls this method of investigation presented, we made sure we scrutinized the group dynamics. As far as we 500 feet Witness Clear-cut Areas ' Flight Path could tell, each held to a personal version without ac- quiescing to group decision or falling under another's influence. We were aware the participants had dis- cussed the events among themselves extensively. Emanuel's efforts at translating were laudable, but he was neither a trained investigator nor interpreter. He had not been present during the abduction, and the event floated somewhere outside his compass of un- derstanding. This presented a challenge, since we were unable to understand for ourselves what the witnesses were saying. Compounding these difficulties, Emanuel seemed reserved in his translations. We knew he be- lieved something strange had happened to his work- ers; however, we also suspected he was not ready to believe anything as exotic as an alien craft snatching up an elk. The testimony waxed expansive and waned timid by turns-torn between the need to tell their story and"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 July 1999 MUFON UFO Journal One of the witnesses, \"Augustine,\" points toward where he saw the craft carry the elk. the anxiety of raised eyebrows at the outrageousness of the tale they told. We struggled with the narrative for 35 minutes. There were innumerable questions yet to ask, but the hour grew late and signals via body language sug- gested we close the interview and bid farewell. Though crippled by the language barrier, our initial interview provided a tentative and skeletal picture of the event. We wanted to schedule individual inter- views for the upcoming week, but were told that the witnesses would be too busy planting trees for the next few weeks-an apparent conspiracy of wet weather and time of year. Our wait was to last 57 days. Weighing on our minds during this time-out was the knowledge that the ponderous passage of time truncates a witness' sharp recollection of details-the blur factor. In the ^meantime we searched for another translator. Find- ing no suitable candidate in Washington, our eyes turned south to California where we knew an ideal interpreter resided. Ruben Uriarte, MUFON's State Director for Northern California, was the answer to our problem: he not only speaks fluent Spanish, but also excels in investigation. Could we recruit him and persuade him to fly to Washington and give us a hand? The answer was an enthusiastic \"yes.\" The follow-up investigation Ruben began immediately by phoning Emanuel and coaxing the witnesses' phone numbers out of propri- etary insularity. Then, over the next few days he arranged a meeting with several of the witnesses at one of the worker's home. Prior to Ruben's involvement in the case, another Wash- ington MUFON investigator, Kathleen Andersen, joined the team. Kathleen began by cross checking other UFO events in the Mt. St. Helens area, seeking correlation and commonalities. She found cases, but no matches. An early gray Seattle morning on the first Saturday of May found Kathleen packing her Jeep with food, with equipment, and with two investigators—Ruben and Rob- ert. We headed south. When we arrived at the desig- nated house, the scene was a bit awkward at first, due to a small crowd that included friends and relatives mill- ing about. The witnesses were not quite sure if they wanted to be interviewed. Fortunately, Ruben has the gift of setting people at ease, and within a short time the witnesses began talk- ing. We were able to interview the witnesses both indi- vidually and together as a group. Later that afternoon, seven of us jumped into two vehicles and drove to the remote site in the foothills where the abduction had taken place. After 9 1/2 hours of investigation, we discovered that the preliminary report (as reported in MUFON UFO JOURNAL of March, 1999) needed amendment."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal July 1999 PageS -5' The incident Shortly before noon on the last Thursday of February, 1999, four- teen forestry workers had just broken for lunch and were head- ing for the crew vehicle. Fran- cisco and Augustine were nearly at the turnout (1900 ft. elevation), Manuel and two others were walking up the slope (about 1600 ft. elevation) from an old over- grown access road, while the rest of the crew was scattered, most midway between the two groups on the north-facing hillside. Fran- cisco stopped to rest momentarily and watched the 14 elk of a herd that had been browsing all morn- ing on a nearby slope northeast of them. Then, out of the northeast, he spotted a strange moving object. The UFO, presumably, had al- ready dropped some 70 feet down the height of the Douglas Fir trees bordering the dirt road and was now drifting over a hilltop. Skimming the clear-cut at brush top level and hugging the contour of the hill, the UFO appeared to be heading slowly toward the herd of elk. The object's initial location was approximately 800 yards distant and 200 ft. lower in elevation than Francisco's loca- tion. At first Francisco mistook it for a bi-colored paraglider silently drifting in for a landing. The object had a strange, slow wobble. It showed red on the right half, white on the left. Francisco quickly realized that he was not seeing any type of parachute. The object advanced toward the elk herd, staying close to the ground as if in a \"stealth mode.\" When the elk became aware of the object, they bolted. Most tried running up the slope to the east, but the going was slow. A lone elk separated from the herd and headed north. The craft targeted the loner and moved in. Sur- prised and astounded, Francisco shouted to August- ine, \"Look at that! Look at that!\" The clear-cut terrain prevented rapid movement for the animals: innumerable small deciduous trees had trunks cut about 18\" above the ground, transforming them into sharp stakes pointing skyward. The trunks, bristling with branches, lay helter-skelter, presenting criss-crossing barricades. The lone animal could not run fast. The wobbling craft, moving no faster than between 5 and 7 mph (est.), easily overtook it. Augustine had missed the pursuit but caught sight TOP VIEW White area on left, red on right. of the UFO as it took the elk. Down-slope, Manuel (crew supervisor) also witnessed the capture-500 yards distant. Nearly every other person's attention had been diverted toward the main group of fleeing animals. The craft moved directly above the female elk and some- how lifted it into the air without any visible means of support evident to the observers. At this point, the animal ceased discernible move- ment-no kicking legs, no struggling body, and no in- dication of consciousness. The witnesses were amazed that the craft could lift the 500-pound animal. The \"wing span\" of the object measured not much longer than the length of the elk-about 7 to 8 feet. (The in- crease in size attributed to the craft in the earlier re- port seems to have been an illusion caused by a change in the craft's angle of tilt over the terrain at the point of capture.) The captured elk, its head apparently against the ven- tral surface of the craft, and body standing stiffly up- right, was lifted off the ground-just enough to clear the underbrush. The craft continued its slow, wobbling oscillation. The suspended elk moved likewise as if she were a solid metal sculpture welded to the craft. After the craft acquired (without pause) the animal, it moved away at the same slow pace, to the north, fol- lowing the contour of the land. The elk's feet were observed sweeping circles, in conjunction with the craft's movement, just above the brush and tree tops. Within a short time the craft approached the forest"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Page 6 July 1999 MUFON UFO Journal Direction of travel Selected craft positions shown for half the oscillation cycle as the object moves forward. edge that defined the end of the clear-cut area. Appar- ently the craft did not stop or maneuver in time to avoid hitting some of the lower branches. Because of the considerable distance of the craft, the witnesses could not discern exactly what had hit the trees-whether the craft, the elk, or something else is unknown. After hitting the branches, the witnesses saw it dip sharply and reverse direction before ascending verti- cally in front of the tree line. All three had the impres- sion that the object had almost dropped the animal. Once above the tree top level, it moved over the forest margin and continued northward, dipped out of sight momentarily (perhaps still following the contour line of tree tops), then ascended at roughly a 45-degree angle into the distance until it was obscured by clouds. Meanwhile, the rest of the herd had gathered into a tight huddle near the tree line, a normal behavior when a predatory threat is perceived. This herd consisted of cows and yearlings. The bulls at this time of year stay in bachelor groups at a higher elevation. The huddle lasted for two hours. Reactions and emotions The witnesses shared their story among themselves at lunch. Several of the workers that had not sighted the craft expressed doubt that anything extraordinary had happened. Nevertheless, the reactions of both the elk and the excited co-workers evoked fear, generat- ing a tense emotional atmosphere. The humans, analo- gous to the elk's behavior, consciously stayed in close proximity for the rest of the afternoon. Even those that doubted the story knew something had happened and were not comfortable working far from the rest. Some, perhaps because of limited beliefs imposed by philosophical predisposition, clung to a tightly fenced world - trying to force all that they had heard into some familiar pattern, consistent with their real- ity. These were the fellows that had directed jokes and gibes at Francisco in particular. These skeptics con- tinued planting seedling trees throughout the afternoon in a normal manner. This was in sharp contrast to those workers who feared a return of the object-they planted with heads continually swiveling skyward. Craft Details Curiously, the witnesses were unable to agree on all the structural details of the craft. No one person had a complete description. Generally, all agreed on the length of the \"wing span\" (7-8 ft.) because they could compare it to the elk suspended beneath. Au- gustine perceived the relative depth to length, which measured out to 14 -18 inches. Manuel had the clearest perception of the width to length (5-6 feet) and the rear indentation. All agreed that the UFO intermittently showed a red and a white patch on the surface. Francisco was sure it was a part of the craft's skin, but Augustine thought they were lights, and Manuel could not tell either way. They were unanimous that the red was dull (compa- rable to red pencil on a heavy textured paper), without luminescence, and that the white reflected like bright enamel paint. They were in agreement that red was on the right, white on the left, yet size, shape and position of the colors was not precisely known. The craft's wobble caused the red and white to show intermittently. (See illustration of oscillation cycle: the top surface orients toward the observer for approxi- mately one half of the wave revolution period.) The craft's color, other than the red and white areas, was described as gray. There were no reflections or sur- face characteristics that suggested the surface was metallic (note: it was an overcast day.). The trio described the craft's complex motion pri- marily through hand movements. As close as can be determined, the UFO had an oscillatory period of about 2 to 2 1/2 seconds. This particular motion-apart from the object's forward motion-is difficult to describe except in terms of analogy. Peter described the motion as similar to that of a spinning coin as it is winding down and closely approaching a flat surface."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal July 1999 Page? Francisco expressed regret that he had not taken time to carefully examine the details of the craft. He had been astounded and felt so much concern for the elk that his attention was focused on watching the animal. He realized immediately that if the object could carry off a 500-pound animal, it could easily abduct a per- son-a frightening notion that several members of the group later shared. Puzzling Question The craft's estimated speed (\"I could walk as fast as it moved.\"-i.e. approximately 5-7 mph) closely matches the estimated duration (3-5 min.) required for the observed distance traveled, as measured on a topo- graphical map. With such a long sighting duration, an important question looms: \"Why didn't more people see the craft with an elk suspended under it?\" A num- ber of reasons appear to answer this: • When Francisco excitedly announced and pointed out the event, only Augustine was near enough to dis- cern that the direction of his index finger pointed left of the herd. 14 panic-stricken elk, all weaving their way up slope, presented a sight that would be apt to draw a person's attention. • Not everyone heard Francisco shout, and the other witnesses remained quiet. • Within a very short time, the craft and herd (both moving away from each other) had separated enough that when bystanders visually searched for an assumed predator, such as a mountain lion, they did not scruti- nize terrain far enough away from the herd to see the craft. They also spent time checking the immediate area around themselves for dangerous animals. • All three witnesses to the craft were so astounded and absorbed with watching the UFO that at the time they did not think to question other spectators as to what they were watching. Aftermath Most of the workers have developed a sudden inter- est in UFOs following this incident. Some related that their spouses did not believe the story. A few are ner- vous when working in the forest, especially when in the general area of the incident-they constantly search the sky. Francisco could not understand what he saw, and spent several sleepless nights pondering whether the object was some type of prehistoric animal or an extraterrestrial craft. All want answers. All graphics were done by Robert Fairfax. Ruban Uriarte submitted the official report to MUFON Headquarters, along with the photos of the witnesses. BLT soil/plant research team provides update of activities The BLT Research Team Inc. a non-profit, tax-ex- empt U.S. corporation whose purpose is the scientific examination of plants, soils and associated materials sampled at crop formation and animal mutilation sites around the world, has issued an update on activities. The BLT team is headed by Michigan biophysicist Wm. C. Levengood, who has been examining crop circle plants and soils since 1989, and includes Ameri- can colleagues Nancy Talbott and John Burke, as well as hundreds of field personnel in many different coun- tries. The update on BLT includes the following: \"(1) We've recently obtained our non-profit, tax ex- empt status here in the U.S. and a grant which is de- signed to allow us to pursue more in-depth analysis of soils (x-ray crystallography and we hope some mi- crobiology) and \"anomalous\" deposited substances recovered at crop circle sites, apparent UFO trace- cases, and unusual animal death sites; we are search- ing for appropriate laboratories to assist us in these pursuits, hopefully here in the Cambridge, MA, area; \"(2) Grass rings in Maryland-multiple green, lush grass rings have been observed and sampled in the roll- ing hillside in Maryland (East Coast, mid-Atlantic re- gion); these rings are growing out-of-phase with the rest of the pasture and range in size from 3-4' diameter to much larger. The redox examination (which mea- sures the rate of respiration in the plant cells) reveals alterations in respiration patterns, consistent with ex- posure to an unusual energy system, similar to what we often observe in crop circle plants and plants sampled at UFO trace-cases and unusual animal death sites. \"(3) Unusual Cattle Deaths-two new cases, one in Oregon (Northwest Coast) on a ranch which has now had 11 of these unusual deaths in the last year, and the other in New Mexico, again an area that has suffered many of these cases. The New Mexico case may be an explainable death, but the Oregon case looks very similar to dozens of others where we have tested the grasses and soils in the last several years. What is of interest to crop circle enthusiasts includes two ba- sic findings so far: \"(a) the finding of increased amounts of magnetic particle material in the soils at these events (over nor- mal control soils taken at various distances away from the animal), and \"(b) the fact that the plants (grasses, in most cases) regularly show changes in plant cell respiration rates, similar to changes observed in plants from crop circle sites.\""},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PageS July 1999 MUFON UFO Journal Two photo events may involve same object By Nicholas F. Schmidt, Ph.D. with Gregg Fisher Incident #1 On April 3,1998, Gregg Fisher and I left Red River, NM, during the early morning hours and drove south towards Roswell. The purpose of our trip was to look for UFOs and to visit places of ufological interest in the Roswell area. Several hours later, at approximately lla.m., Mr. Fisher spotted a silver-white, shimmering object to our West in a cloudless sky just north of where the Pecos River intersects Route 84 in New Mexico. Mr. Fisher pulled his truck to the side of the road. We left the vehicle to continue observing the object, which re- mained in the same place for about 10 minutes, 35 degrees above the horizon and, by our estimate, a half mile away in the southwest sky. During that time it disappeared and reappeared sev- eral times in the same spot, seemingly fading in and out of view when it so desired. When observable, the object was noiseless, absent wings, tail section, con- trail or flashing lights, remained stationary, and glit- tered as though someone were reflecting sunlight back to us with a mirror. The object then \"blinked out\" for 10-15 minutes, only to reappear in the southeastern sky approximately the same distance from the original point of observa- tion. Viewed with the naked eye, it exhibited the same characteristics as described above. Mr. Fisher located the object in his binoculars (8x21) and observed it for 30-40 seconds. Through the bin- oculars he saw an ovoid disk, flat on the bottom and oval shaped on top, rapidly vibrating up and down. The object hovered in place during the entire 30-40 seconds of observation. I eventually found a whitish object in my camera lens. Then, with autofocus4ocked on infinity and with- out the need for panning, I took 5 pictures over a 5-7 second time period. At that point the object abruptly disappeared from view. The entire incident lasted some 30 minutes. No missing time was experienced. It is important to note that while I took the pictures, Mr. Fisher continued to observe the object through the binoculars. What he observed and subsequently sketched on paper was quite different from the photo- graphic evidence. This intriguing anomaly would hap- pen again. The film was developed that same day in Roswell. A detailed field report was written soon thereafter (I am a former consultant for MUFON). A week or so later the field report and the Ix photos were shared with Bob Turner, State Director of MUFON New Mexico. Immediately thereafter this same report (mi- nus photos) was submitted to Walter Andrus at MUFON National Headquarters after contacting him by phone. Incident #2 Almost thirty days after the first incident Mr. Fisher and I returned to Dallas, TX, via Arizona and lower New Mexico. On May 2, between the hours of 1 and 2 p.m., I spotted a shimmering object while we were driving South on Interstate 17 several miles north of Cornville, AZ. We stopped the vehicle, stepped out- side and scanned the area for quite some time, but the object did not reappear. No other objects were visible in that section of sky. The appearance and behavior of the object was simi- lar to that of the first incident, even though this sight- ing event lasted only five seconds. The object was es- timated to be less than a mile from our point of obser- vation and about 60 degrees above the horizon in the southwest sky. The next morning (May 3) we left Eagar, AZ, at 8:30 a.m. and headed east on Route 60 towards New Mexico. Two hours later we began to pass through the desolate Plains of St. Agustin and eventually reached the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, VLA Telescope site located between the towns of Datil and Magdalena (western New Mexico). The White Sands Missile Range is located approximately 75 miles south- east of this site. Prior to arriving at the Observatory, an object appeared several times on the left-hand side of our truck, but Mr. Fisher identified it as a small, dark airplane. We stopped on the side of the road by the Observa- tory, the only people in the area. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Fisher spotted an object in the northeast sky esti- mated to be a mile from our location and about 35 degrees above the horizon. The sky was clear and cloudless. It was approximately 10:30 a.m. After view- ing the object through his binoculars for several sec- onds he distinctly felt it was a small airplane moving from right to left. Strangely, the \"plane\" was dark in color, totally silent, and no flashing lights, markings, motor/propeller or cockpit windows were visible. I pointed my camera at the object, which appeared as a small, whitish spec, and centered it in the viewing lens. With autofocus on infinity and without panning, I snapped 5 pictures in about 5 seconds. The fifth pic- ture did not contain the object as it disappeared be- tween frames 4-5 and was no longer visible. I could not tell what the object was through the camera lens, nor did I hear any engine sounds.

No missing time was experienced during this event. When 1 returned to Connecticut and had the film developed, 1 could see that the object photographed was not an airplane. Mr. Turner and Mr. Andrus were sent copies of the May 3 field report. Photographic Details The camera used to photograph both sightings was a Nikon 8008S, 35-millimeter still camera equipped with a Nikon ED, AF Nikkor 80-200mm, 1: 2.8 zoom lens. During incident # 1, Kodak Plus 100 for color prints (ASA 100) was used, the lens opening was f-5.6 (estimated), the shutter speed was 1/1000 of a second, and the zoom lens was set at maximum distance (200mm). During incident #2, Kodak Gold 200 for color prints (ASA 200) was used, the lens opening was not noted, the automatic shutter speed was most likely 1/1000 of a second, and the zoom lens was set to its maximum (200mm). All photographic negatives of the object from the first and second incident (nine total) were eventually taken to a professional laboratory and enlarged to 50x under the same conditions. The enlarging apparatus was a Super 0 Chromega F Dichroic II fitted with a 63mm EL-Nikkor lens, 1:2.8. All color filters were set to neutral. The pictures were printed on Kodak EKTA Color Supra IIF glossy paper. Photographic Evidence Figure 1 (previous page) shows the five pictures taken during the April 3, 1998, incident. All photos were taken within a 5-7 second time span and are en- larged 50-fold. \"Morphing\" of the object over this short period of time is readily apparent, which occurred just prior to blinking out. In addition, an aura surrounds the object, and it too changes shape as the object changes configuration. Figure 2 (previous page) contains the four pictures of the object taken during the May 3, 1998, event. All photos were taken within a 5-second time span and were enlarged 50-fold. Again, morphing of the object can be observed seconds before it disappeared from view. A comparison can be made between both objects. Photo A is a 50x enlargement of print #1 from the April 3 incident; photo B is a 50x enlargement of print #1 from the May 3 incident. Interestingly, each photograph was the first of five in the sequence of pictures taken from each incident. During the second incident, the distance to the ob- ject from the camera seemed to be further than that of the first incident. In addition, only print #1 from the May 3 photographs exhibits a shape that has a reason- ably defined \"3-ball\"-like configuration (see Figure 2). The three remaining pictures of this incident show that the object is similar in length to that observed in print #1 but the object is less defined and more diffuse. However, a close inspection of all four 50x pictures using additional magnification, e.g. a Bausch and Lomb magnifying glass, shows that the object has a different shape in each instance. Data Analysis It is important to note that the general sequence in both events was (a) the suspicious object was spotted, (b) Mr. Fisher observed the object through his binocu- lars, (c) photos were taken while object was being ob- served through the binoculars (d) object disappeared while being photographed, and, (e) pictures of the ob- ject show it to be markedly different from that observed through the binoculars. The length of the object from incident #1 at Ix en- largement on a 4 x 6 inch print is approximately 0.75mm. The length of the object from incident #2 under the same conditions is about 0.5mm. Since a 35mm negative is some 4.6 times smaller in width than a Ix print (including 5% for cropping) the length of each object in the negatives becomes 0.16mm and 0.11 mm respectively. Using this information, the size of the object photo- graphed during the April 3 sighting was estimated as follows: the length of the object (0.16mm) in negative #1 was divided by the focal length of the lens (200mm). The resultant value (0.0008) was then multiplied by the estimated distance to the object in feet. In this event, we guessed the object's farthest distance to be 1/2 mile or 2,640 feet. This yielded a length close to 2 feet, which seems unlikely. Applying this same formula to nega- tive # 1 of the May 3 sighting, the object would be about 3 feet in length if it were 1 mile from our esti- mated observation point. Again, this seems unlikely. Since we were unable to use any reference points or triangulate a distance to the object in either event, es- timate of size cannot be done with any accuracy. For example, in order for the object to have a length in the range of 12 feet it would have had to be some 3 miles from our point of observation. It is clear that our esti- mate of distance in both events was an educated guess at best. It is evident from Figure 1 that the object has a dif- ferent shape in all five photos. What is most striking is that the object starts off as a distinct 3-ball shape as seen in a two-dimensional plane (Figure 1, Photo #1). Then, in the next photo, two of the 3 balls have merged into one while the remaining ball has expanded slightly in size. In Photo #3, all 3 balls have merged into a single."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal July 1999 Page 11 ovoid object. All of this took place within seconds. Photo #4 shows continued morphing without discern- ible segmentation, while Photo #5 suggests the object is beginning to segment again. One second later it blinked out. The entire sequence of shape-change lasted 5-7 seconds. It is more difficult to determine quality and degree of shape-change in the second set of photographs be- cause the object is not as clearly defined. However, two observations can be made with some degree of confidence: (1) the first print is the only one to exhibit a 3-ball configuration similar to the object in the first event, and (2) the shape of the object in each of the four photos appears to be different. As mentioned previously, print #1 from the April 3 event and print #1 from the May 3 event exhibited a 3-ball type configuration. Interestingly, when one ori- ents these two prints in the same way (left/right and up/down) both objects exhibit a short, \"wispy, cloud-like tail\" at the right/rear of its structure. Finally, a comparison of the first photos from each incident (Figures 1 and 2) shows that both objects ap- pear to be similar. Equally intriguing is that during each photographic event the object starts off as a well-defined, 3-balled structure. Then, a short period of morphing occurs, followed by blinking out. When one compares both incidents, the morphological data, the overall pattern of behavior, and the time that tran- spired prior to blinking out (5-7 seconds), this suggests that it may have been the same object in both instances. The aura or corona around the object during the April 3 sighting was quite visible and changed shape as did the object. In the 50x color prints, the aura has a white color in Photo 1. However, as the object begins to merge into itself in Photo 2 the periphery of the object starts to change to a magenta color which extends into the filamentous corona itself. In Photo 3 the object is mostly an intense white, while the periphery/filamen- tous aura is now mostly magenta. This holds true for Photos 4 and 5 as well just before the object disap- pears. The changes in the shape of the corona for both objects can be seen at the URL addresses cited below. While photographing both events, I kept the object centered as well as possible in the camera lens, and no panning was required to accomplish that. In other words, I did not have to compensate for any sideways movement because the object was hovering in place. This observation is supported by all nine Ix prints which show that the object is generally centered in the middle of each picture. Mr. Fisher, who has excellent eyesight and percep- tive abilities, sketched what he observed in his bin- oculars during both incidents. In the first case the ob- ject he drew was clearly an ovoid disc, while his de- piction of the object from the second incident shows it to be a small airplane with wings and a tail section connected to a cigar-shaped body. (Figure 2, bottom) Overall, the evidence suggests that the object did not resemble, nor did it behave like, a conventional plane, helicopter, weather balloon, or blimp. Discussion The experience of witnessing and photographing an unidentified object on two separate occasions thirty days apart, in the same state, during cloudless days, had three compelling elements to it: (1) the object morphed just prior to blinking out, (2) the object ap- peared to be similar in both instances, and, (3) in both events, what was observed by one witness through bin- oculars was not the same as that which later appeared in developed photographs. The morphing phenomenon observed herein has occurred before with unidentified flying object sightings, although it is more the exception than the rule. Scanning through prior issues of The UFO Newsclipping Service (1995-96) the following obser- vations were made by witnesses: (a) \"...each one the size of a small dinner plate, fly- ing through the sky... As they approached they appeared to change into a triangular shape.\" (b) \"It had three lights and stayed in one place... it changed to a half moon shape ... it came in close and changed shape again.\" (c) \"...when it (bright white object) approached the horizon, he said it flared up about 20 times its original size, turned into an oval shape and stopped dead.\" (d) \"As the UFO moved across the sky, it repeat- edly changed color and shape and winked in and out.\" (e) \"I saw a small yellow object... I watched it slowly change into a triangular shape, then suddenly it disap- peared.\" In addition, morphing/merging is mentioned in a MUFON 1994 International UFO Symposium Pro- ceedings paper presented by Dr. Richard Haines. In this article he refers to \"a gaseous plasma-like consti- tution, which can appear to merge into another one,\" and \"a round translucent object (like a balloon) seemed to approach and then merge into a cylindrical object.\" In that same study he also points out that fragmenta- tion or shape change is described by witnesses 45/230 times, a frequency of almost 20%. In addition, the au- thor also reports a smaller percentage of cases in which sudden appearance/disappearance occurs as happened during our April 3 event. In 1995, in this same MUFON Symposium format, Dr. Francisco Lewels says, \"UFOs have been reported to split in two or to merge together, to appear and dis- appear, as if going to and from another dimension.\" All of the above support the contention that UFOs"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Page 12 July 1999 MUFON UFO Journal can morph and change their shape. When examining the physical changes taking place with the object in Figures 1 and 2, it would appear that this same phe- nomenon is taking place. This is more apparent when one digitizes and computer enhances these same pho- tographs (see http://home.earthlink.net/~fromthestars/ page21.html for the original photographs and page2O.html for the enhanced versions). After enhancement one can readily see that the denser part of the object undergoes dynamic morpho- logical contortions while a pronounced, corona-type envelope surrounds it. As one views these images in sequence it seems as though a lot of \"energy\" is being expended prior to blinking out. It may be that this type of intense morphing is a prelude to rapid acceleration (see below), \"shape-shifting\" into another dimension, or transitioning from the range of visible light. This exceptional pattern of behavior and the short length of time required to shift from a well-defined, 3-balled structure to the point of blinking out was com- mon to both events. It may be that the two sets of pho- tographs shown herein are the only ones published to date which capture this unusual phenomenon. Morphing crafts may indeed have the ability to de- materialize into another dimension as Dr. Lewel sug- gests. If an advanced intelligence were behind the object's existence, it is possible that it may have mas- tered the technology of materialization and demateri- alization into another dimension or within our own. Regarding the colored corona evident during the April 3 event, a reference to a colored, aura-shaped shroud surrounding an object was made in an article published in the MUFON UFO Journal (February, 1997). The author, Dr. Roger K. Leir, described an investigation of a self-luminous disc which \"appears to have a gaseous shroud surrounding its core.\" This was based upon evidence obtained from an in-depth analysis of both still and video photographs. He further stated that the object appeared to be ovoid, and that computerization enhancement showed \"mul- tiple colored bands surrounding the periphery of the object.\" Interestingly, the photographic analysis sug- gests that at one point the object \"had no mass and appeared to be gaseous or cloudlike.\" The size of the object was estimated to be 19 feet in length and was classified as \"unidentified\" by SVP Digital Systems (Studio City, CA), who did the photographic analysis. It may also be possible that the phenomenon of \"ha- lation\" was occurring, with the photos exhibiting an aura, especially during the April 3 event. The produc- tion of a halo around a brightly-lit object can cause a sideways light leakage into the film and can make it appear as if an object has a halo around it. The instantaneous disappearance of the object in both events ma$ alternatively be explained by the phe- nomenon of \"rapid acceleration.\" In an article titled \"Acceleration,\" by Dr. Bruce Maccabee (http:// www.accessnv.com/nids/whatelse.shtml), the author makes the point that the human eye can only integrate and detect movement up to a certain point, after which an object in motion becomes \"invisible.\" He cites the example of a transparent gun barrel in which the bullet can be seen prior to firing but be- comes invisible when the bullet is discharged due to its rapid acceleration. In that same article, Dr. Maccabee offers evidence that UFOs can move fast enough for this same phenomenon to occur not only when they are viewed with the naked eye, but within actual video footage evidence wherein an object is present in one frame but absent in the next. Regarding the shape similarities of the object dur- ing both occasions, we will let the readers judge for themselves when comparing the photos and the be- havior patterns from the two different events. Need- less to say, if the objects were the same in both events it raises some very provocative questions, not the least of which are (a) was the object following us?, (b) whose object is it?, (c) what intelligence was behind the ob- ject?, and, (d) was the object trying to tell us some- thing? As far as one observer seeing one thing through bin- oculars and the photos showing something significantly different, we are at a loss to explain what happened. In both instances, I am quite certain that what I photo- graphed was the same object that Mr. Fisher was ob- serving. There simply wasn't any other object visible in that section of the sky at that time. However, the anomaly of Mr. Fisher observing one thing and the photographic evidence showing something else re- mains a mystery. In conclusion, one must finally ask a very funda- mental question, \"Is the craft from both sightings an unidentified flying object?\" It would seem so given the available photographic, behavioral, and eyewitness evidence, and suggests that the object be classified as \"unidentified\" at this time.

Reviewed by Dwight Connelly Fitzgerald, who is a contributing editor for Reader's Digest, takes a generally even-handed look at extra- terrestrial contact by reviewing many, many books in the field. This is his second book in the UFO field, having written The Complete Book of Extraterrestrial Encounters, published in 1979 by Macmillan,. Cosmic Test Tube covers five areas: ancient astro- naut theories, UFO sightings, contactees and abductees, debunkers and skeptics, and SETI (scientific search for life in the Universe). He writes an introduction to each of these five sections, then utilizes reviews of the more notable books in each area to give the reader a short course in the representative literature. In the contactee and abductees section, for example, he includes reviews ranging from Flying Saucers Have Landed by Desmond Leslie and George Adamski to The Interrupted Journey by John Fuller. The value of this book is its dverview of the numer- ous books which are outlined and reviewed. Cosmic Test Tube is in some respects an encyclopedia of UFOs- at least in the five areas covered-but with the advan- tage of a diversity of viewpoints not usually available in one volume.

Reviewed by Dwight Connelly Perhaps what sets this book apart from the many abduction books now on the market is that it is a com- bination of seven stories from the perspective of the abductees who actually lived the experiences. While Ms. Clear writes a prologue and occasional \"session notes\" for each story in order to provide necessary back- ground information, this is very much a personal ac- count by each abductee, told in their own styles. There is no \"party line\" here. Each abductee relates his or her individual experiences, feelings, and con- clusions, if any. In talking with Ms. Clear, one gets the impression of a caring clinician who finds herself more or less accidentally involved in a strange phe- nomenon which her degrees from Trinity University and Our Lady of the Lake University never fully pre- pared her for. I would recommend this very interesting and en- lightening book to anyone interested in abductions. The Mountain of Mist by Patrick Coulcher. Hard- back, 208 pages; The Book Guild Ltd, 25 High St., Lewes, Sussex, UK. 12.50 pounds. Reviewed by Dwight Connelly Normally the Journal does not review fiction, but this one is somewhat different. My initial contact with the author came through his son, who told me that this ex-Royal Air Force pilot had experienced events re- lated to UFOs while on active duty, and was recount- ing the experiences in the form of a novel. The book opens at McDill AFB in Florida, where Sean Foster, a Royal Air Force pilot, is serving as an exchange officer with the U.S. Air Force. He has some exciting experiences with his planes, forcing ejections from his F-4, plus some romantic encounters that add to the plot. From the UFO perspective, however, it is Sean's fright- ening aerial encounter with a strange light near the Ber- muda Triangle that provides the most interest. Shaken by the experience, which had caused his F-4 to plunge rapidly toward the sea, he and his backseater pledged not to tell anyone, fearful it might result in being considered unfit to fly. Does this sound familiar? Later, Sean has an encounter with a strange alien- looking man who seems to know about the episode with the light. Sean is both fascinated and fearful of this individual, who promises to contact him later. After Sean returns to England for his rotation to a desk job with the Royal Air Force, the strange man again contacts him, asking him to go to certain areas of the British Isles to retrieve some sort of artifacts. Meanwhile, Sean finally finds the girl of his dreams, and plans to marry her, but he can't bring himself to tell her about his experiences. Up to this point, according to Coulcher, the story is essentially true. The ending is a different matter. If you like UFOs and military things (especially F- 4s), enjoy a little light romance, and have a sneaking suspicion that pilots experience a lot of things they won't talk about, this book is for you. But what an ending (fictional, fortunately)."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Page 14 July 1999 MUFON UFO Journal Filer's Files By George A.

KARNES CITY, TX — Michael Harvey writes that in the summer of 1971, \"I was working the night shift for Conoco Oil Company at an open pit uranium mine west of Karnes City, Texas. I was one of six people operating Caterpillar 657B earth movers. We were down to about 210 feet deep when this incident hap- pened. \"Itwasabout 11:10 p.m., just after shift change. We were getting ready to crank our machines when the 85-acre pit lit up as if it was daylight. The light was so bright that I had to squint because it hurt my eyes. I remember hearing a high pitched hissing noise and the hair on my arms stood on end. \"I was so scared! I fell to the ground and started praying. I remember trying to look up, but the light was so bright I could not. After about two minutes, the light started getting dimmer and I could finally look up at it. What I saw amazed me. The object was round and the bright light was coming from the center of the bottom of the UFO. \"Around the perimeter of the craft were hundreds of penlight size light beams that alternated in all col- ors of the spectrum. Now I know they were laser beams. The UFO was rising up slowly at first and then went straight up out of sight in about 10 seconds. I was crying and shaking, and so was everyone else. The other shift workers thought we were crazy when we told them what had happened. \"But, we got the last laugh. This is how we proved the sighting actually happened. There is a vein of ura- nium ore that runs from George West, Texas, to almost Texarkana, TX. When determining where to place a uranium mine, the following steps are accomplished: \"(1) A geologist with a Geiger counter flies over the area and finds the highest radiation reading. \"(2) Drilling trucks are sent out and core samples are drilled to determine the highest concentration of ore. These core samples are drilled in a grid pattern and every core sample is given a tracking number and logged in showing the concentration and amount of uranium present. \"(3) The open pit mine is then laid out according to these core samples. \"When this UFO incident happened, we were about two feet away from a layer of hard rock called the 'tap rock' that lies directly on top of the uranium ore. The uranium ore varied in depth from 6 to 18 inches and had about the same brown color as low grade coal. Two days after this incident, the tap rock was removed to expose the uranium ore. We were astounded to find that the uranium ore was now a chalky white substance that had NO radioactivity at all! \"There was a 250-foot diameter circle of this chalky material in the center of the pit. Outside of the circle, the uranium ore was still as potent as before the inci- dent. Core samples do not lie. This chalky material was uranium before this incident. Many a night I have thought about what happened and wondered why the UFO needed the uranium?\" Thanks to M. Harvey, Sam Rayburn Lake, TX mharve@inu.net 'Angel hair' in Australia? ESPERANCE, WEST AUSTRALIA - Diane Harrison, Australian Skywatch Director, reports that on June 9, 1999, \"tons\" of white filamentous threads were seen falling from the sky over a 90 kilometer area. Paddocks, hedges, and trees were covered with the stuff, and it hung off power lines in great shrouds with lengths up to thirty feet long. Apparently the sky was thick with it up to a thousand feet or more. The threads fell for five hours from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. All the paddocks in the area had a \"sheen\" caused by layers of the stuff. Some material was picked up to try to get it analyzed. A Cessna aircraft was flying at 200 feet through the falling threads. Three contrails were stationary much higher.

To my amazement I saw a round and silver metallic UFO appear beneath the commercial jet. I pulled up the window to get a clearer view. \"Then another identical craft appeared, both moving east. What seemed more strange was how the craft were able to pass so close under the commercial jet without any wobbling effect. Then I noticed a strange flashing strobe light on top or near the top of the craft. These are not like the lights you see flashing on a jet or a helicopter. \"The two UFOs maneuvered slowly and si- lently probing and just observing our daily activities and routine. They did not seem to present any type of danger to the commercial aircraft. The sides of the two UFOs had a cylinder bell shape, but flat on the top. They were a black metallic color. I watched them fly over the Mutual Benefit Life building in downtown Newark. \"Suddenly a bright light was emitted from one craft towards me. Although it may have been a reflec- tion from the sun off the surface of the craft, I felt a ray of warmth for a second or two. I felt it might be a sign or signal that they knew I was watching them. As far as I can tell the UFOs were heading west. Perhaps there have been other reports to confirm my sighting?\" Thanks to Lafayette Robert Ward.

This aroused my interest enough to go outside and look. I noticed three gray, slightly metallic, slightly oval spheres slowly rotating or \"rolling\" over one another as they traveled horizontally. \"Then a low level fourth sphere came and joined the original three.

But less dramatic, even unexamined videotapes can likewise support anecdotal claims of alien visitation. In August 1998, veteran MUFON investigator Joe Stewart was called to a home in the small town of Oakley, MI, where two women had observed and briefly taped some- thing unusual four months earlier on the night of April 20. His quick thinking while on the scene, assessing both the UFO image and a separate section of the tape, raised the status of this case from ordinary to significant. The Event Having returned from a shopping trip, the two women were resting on the front porch moments after 9 p.m. when one of them noticed a brilliant light in the west. (Using nearby landmarks, Joe and the witnesses later determined a compass heading of 265 degrees and an elevation of 38 degrees.) Assuming it to be the headlights of an approach- ing jetliner, perhaps headed for Flint's Bishop Airport 25 miles southeast, the women paid little attention at first. As the minutes grew to fifteen and the object remained seemingly stationary, though, they became intrigued. While one watched continuously, the other made a series of tele- phone calls, first to two Flint TV stations, which yielded no other reports. She then contacted Capital City Airport in Lansing, located 35 miles southwest, which reported no air- liner or anything on radar in the vicinity of Oakley. Seeking additional witnesses, she phoned the Oakley Police and Saginaw County Sheriff Department. While waiting, they retrieved a camcorder and trained it on the light. Through the viewfinder, the object had a bell shape. The main body glowed steadily in a bluish white and overlay three lights along the rim-red on the left, white in the center and blue on the right-which pulsated in se- quence. The zoom feature was employed initially, turned off for a few seconds, then back on. After just 58 seconds of recording, believing (probably in error) that the object was coming closer, the woman operating the camera be- came unnerved and shut it off. An Oakley constable arrived at 9:45 and immediately decided-over the women's protests that the light had not moved for over 40 minutes at that point - that they were viewing an aircraft. Moments later a sheriff deputy joined the group. After looking at the anomaly for a few minutes, he announced that he was very familiar with aircraft and this was not one. He also told the women, whether joking or not, that if anyone were to ask, he was never there. As the women and deputy continued their vigil, at 10:15 the object moved laterally and slowly left (south) somewhat, whereupon it was lost from view. The Investigation After gathering interview particulars, Joe viewed the vid- eotape. He soon realized that, throughout the scant minute of tape in question, the auto focus feature was continually if slightly readjusting. In layman's terms, the machine was confused as to how to focus a single brilliant object against a black background. Fortunately, the tape does contain several seconds of a line of trees on the horizon when the zoom feature was off. That will be an essential facet when the tape is profession- ally analyzed. He confirmed the focusing irregularity by reviewing a separate segment, taken several days after the first event. The woman had trained her recorder momentarily on what she thought was the same or a similar light, this time in the north. Streetlights in the foreground this time caused the same focusing problem, Joe determined. On this occasion, the targeted light was apparently much farther away and did not present the same details of shape and color on tape. In retrospect, the light's increasing size in the viewfinder on April 20, as the focus self-adjusted, probably caused the woman to believe it was suddenly approaching, whereupon she switched the camcorder off. When oversized, motionless lights are reported as UFOs, two IFO possibilities must always be addressed: a bright planet such as Venus or Jupiter in a negative magnitude (say, minus 1 to minus 4); and oncoming airplane head- lights. A check of \"The Night Sky\" in the March 1998 issue of the Journal eliminated the first possibility. As Walt Webb succinctly stated for the month of April 1998, \"There are no bright planets in the evening sky this month.\" The notion of an aircraft directly approaching the wit- nesses with its landing lights on cannot be so easily dis- missed. Commercial airliners often rum on their headlights many miles before landing. Further, the witness' agreement that the object moved slowly to the left over a couple of minutes prior to \"disappearing\" would not be inconsistent with an eastward traveling aircraft banking southeast on its path to Flint. Two factors argue against that scenario, however. First is the sheer duration of the sighting. Even if we assume they were viewing an oncoming, twin-engine prop aircraft with powerful headlights, traveling at a typical 150 mph, the 70 minutes of observation before it veered to the south- east would have taken it some 175 miles. It stretches credu- lity that when over 100 miles away (i.e., over the first half- hour of the sighting) the women would have taken notice at all. Second, they recounted and the videotape underscored that a smaller red light was present on the left bottom edge, which would have to be on an oncoming airplane's right wing. As even inexperienced field investigators should know, every airplane must have a green steady light on the right wingtip and a red on the left. All things considered-multiple witnesses, including a sheriff deputy, each considered credible; careful tracking of the total elapsed time; the brief but intriguing footage of an apparent anomaly; and Joe Stewart's insight upon re- viewing separate segments of the tape-this must be regarded as a credible UFO event. s."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal July 1999 Page 17 Pilot finally reveals UFO encounter Editor's Note: Following is an account recently provided by a retired Air Force Lt. Col., who asks that his name not be used. It is on file at MUFON Headquarters. In the interest of getting this account on paper, the following is a description of events as I remember them. The actual date and time can be obtained from my flight records. In 1960 1 was an Instructor Pilot, 1st Lt, in F-89J's stationed at James Connelly AFB in Waco, TX. The Instructor Radar Observer I was teamed with was 1st Lt Joe E. Meyer. In late 1959 or early 1960 Gen. Curtis E. LeMay conducted an exercise to test his bombers' capability to penetrate our air defenses, and we, as a fighter squad- ron, were ordered to stand down from training RO's (Radar Observers) and to participate in the air defense exercise. At about 10 p.m. I was scrambled from hot alert and turned over to the controlling radar site at Ft. Hood. A \"bogey\" had been detected in West Texas, and I was assigned to intercept it. I ran in the afterburner longer than anticipated, and made a successful intercept of a B-47 at 42,000 feet somewhere near Midland, TX. My exact location was not a concern as I was under radar control. After the intercept I swung around and headed back towards Waco. As I said, I was getting low on fuel, so I pulled the throttles back a little and went into a gradual powered descent. There was a thin undercast below us at about 10,000 feet. The night was crystal clear with visibility unlimited. The starlight and moonlight were bright enough to see the white undercast below us as I de- scended for an approach into James Connelly. At this point we were still under radar control from Ft. Hood. I arrived just north and west of Waco at 22,000 feet and could see the base through some breaks in the clouds. The lights of Waco lit up the clouds to my right below, adding to my orientation. At this time I broke off radar control as I had the field in sight and intended to make a VFR approach as there was no other traffic on the radio. I swung to the right towards Waco, and out offeree of habit looked over my shoulder to be certain I wasn't turning into another aircraft. In so doing I noticed a light way out to my right and level with us, over Waco. I pointed this out to Joe, and he also saw the light. I continued my turn while watching the pinpoint of light. It didn't move as I swung into it. I added power, leveled off, and put the object on my nose. At 12 miles Joe told me he had picked up the object and would lock-on if he could. In a moment he had a lock-on, and my pilot's scope lit up to show a collision course to fly for firing our 2.75 rockets. Although unarmed, the attack radar presented in- formation as if we were armed. Joe gave me course and overtake information and, as we approached, I could see that the object had 4 extremely bright blue-white round dots of light on the side that I could observe. I checked my true airspeed against the over- take ring on my scope, as by now we were down to 10 seconds to fire. Our overtake and my true airspeed were identical, meaning that the object was standing still. I was read- ing 275 TAS. I tried to measure the width of the object against my wingspan and came up with something around 25-30 feet. Joe and I estimated the height at 8- 9 feet. By now we were down to 5 seconds to fire and on a collision course with the object. I wondered what the hell I was going to do. We were both talking, and Joe could see it over my helmet. We concluded it was a UFO. I remember that the technique of ramming, which was taught as a last resort, came into my mind. Instantly the dot on my scope flew up and I heard the radar antenna hit the stops. I had been looking at the scope. I looked up to see the object climbing straight up at an incredible speed. Within a few seconds we were directly under where the object had been, and Joe and I looked straight up into its belly, which was round and, again, a brilliant blue-white. A white, white. When I flew directly below the spot where the ob- ject had been, I anticipated hitting the \"wash\" from the downward thrust of whatever engine was power- ing the craft. But to our surprise there was none. No bump as we expected. No downward thrust as from a propeller or rocket engine. As we watched, the vehicle rapidly became smaller and smaller until it was like a star in the sky, then it went out of sight. Joe and I estimated that we lost sight of it in excess of 90,000 feet. We were extremely shaken up by the event and swore each other to se- crecy, as we knew if we mentioned what had just hap- pened we would be branded as nuts and not believed and probably grounded. I completed the letdown and landing, and Joe and I never spoke of the incident again. I was transferred later that year and have not seen or spoken to Joe since that time. The foregoing is a true account, and the first time I have put it in writing. I have told a few people of the encounter in recent years because 1 feel it now should be known that these encounters are factual, can be documented and witnessed, and that the object was solid and would reflect a radar pulse."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Page 18 July 1999 MUFON UFO Journal Richard F. Haines Spotting space debris and finding UFOs By Richard F. Haines, Ph.D. Copyright 1999 Even though planet Earth is our home, we humans have been polluting its land, water, and near atmo- sphere since the dawn of man. With the advent of the space age in 1957 we have been polluting near space with deliberate and accidental man-made debris. This brief article is about orbital debris and an implication that this debris has for those who study unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Two separate but interre- lated themes are addressed here: (a) the general magni- tude of the dcbns problem and (b) existing ground-based and space-based sensing capabili- ties that are used to detect, measure, and record this debris. If we can detect and even crudely identify such a vast array of different sized objects, can't we also detect alleged larger UFOs? Surprisingly, the answer is \"not necessarily!\" The Magnitude of the Problem Depending upon who you listen to there are at least 9,000 primary (large) objects in Earth orbit today, give or take a few scored This number comes from the U.S. Satellite Catalog . Their orbits range from very low to very high, from circular to great ellipses, and from al- most equatorial to polar inclinations. In some cases people on Earth can actually see some of these space objects (unwanted debris and still functioning satel- lites, space station Mir and Space Shuttle) under the right viewing conditions. Various nuts and bolts, rocket casings, fuel tanks, spring mechanisms, sheet metal plates, rocket upper stage parts (following explosions), and an enormous variety of other items continue to drift at orbital veloc- ity (typically 17,000 mph or more) until they eventu- ally slow down, re-enter Earth's atmosphere, and burn up. The same can be said for Iridium spacecraft (typ. altitude 785 km) and rocket upper stages which are launched into LEO parking orbits and which naturally decay in about 25 years. The sheer mass of space debris is staggering, with about 4,000 metric tons currently circling the globe, and another 175 metric tons being added each year. With this much \"garbage\" up there, the Department of Defense and NASA held a national workshop in Janu- ary 1998 to try to develop effective means of minimiz- ing the creation of new debris (by disposing of various existing objects and structures after they have served their purpose and reducing the release of new objects) so that orbiting space vehicles will not collide with this screen of potentially dangerous, high energy de- bris. High kinetic energy (KE) indeed. KE is simply ve- locity times mass. So even though a piece of debris may possess a very small mass, say a 1/4\" stainless steel nut, its KE at orbital velocity can be enormous. Should it strike a solar panel, an optical window, or a fuel tank, it could render these things useless. Should it strike the Space Shuttle's windows it could produce immediate and far worse consequences. Tracking of Space Debris. As Johnson and Loftus (1999) point out, current ground-based space surveillance systems are limited to tracking objects larger than 10 cm (about 4 inches) diameter in low earth orbit (LEO) and 1 meter (39.4 inches) in diameter at geosynchronos earth orbit (GEO) just over 23,000 miles from Earth. Yet Earth-based radar and optical tracking devices have shown that more than 100,000 separate objects now encircle Earth that are from 0.4 inch to 10 inches diameter. Some- thing like the famed Sargasso Sea located NE of the West Indies, where flotsam tend to congregate into a gigantic swirling mass due to the sea currents there, our near-Earth space environment is slowly filling up, relatively speaking. Of course the distance between each piece of space debris and its nearest neighbor is still very great; yet if an unmanned communication satellite, for example, should slam into even a tiny particle, the satellite could stop working. Its signals would cease. Its controllers would immediately suspect that a collision had oc- curred even though it couldn't be seen visually or by using radar. In addition, space-based satellite sensors can moni- tor the presence and identity of debris, and their find- ings can be cross-correlated with ground-based sensor output. Working together, they form an irregular grid network of sensitive viewing \"lines\" all around the Earth. What then is the possibility that a non-terrestrial object (a so-called UFO) could travel toward Earth and reach a relatively near distance without being detected optically (or in other radiation wavelengths) by at least one of our sensing system? The answer to this ques- tion is very complex; it depends on a host of both tech- nical and operational factors. For example, if software \"acceptance filters\" of an active space surveillance"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal July 1999 Page 19 system, such as is operated by the North American Radar Defense (NORAD) organization, are pro- grammed to automatically exclude all objects travel- ling in a non-parabolic trajectory, then we will never \"see\" objects flying along a straight or even a circular trajectory. If we don't believe that UFOs are actual physical objects, astronomers will more likely misidentify them when seen through optical telescopes. And if UFOs possess advanced radar stealth or other such capabilities, they may also avoid our detection. But If we can now detect objects many hundreds of miles in space down to about four inches in size, know- ing where they are in the first place-so we know where to look later-can we also expect to automatically de- tect UFOs that are claimed to be orders of magnitude larger? Not necessarily. The reason for this is simply that the volume of space surrounding our planet is so large and our sensing capabilities so limited that we can't be looking everywhere at the same time. At the present time at least, there are large gaps in surveillance cov- erage. Presuming that UFOs exist and are intelligently guided, we may also presume that they can plot the location of individual items making up this sphere of junk surrounding Earth, just as we do - not only to avoid colliding with these objects, but, more impor- tantly, to lessen the probability of being accidentally tracked by our sensing systems. By now UFOs may know where not to fly. Is this a possibility? Why not? Reference: Johnson, N.L., and J.P. Loftus, Jr., Reducing orbital debris: standards and practices.

Spielberg to produce abduction miniseries Oscar-winning film director Steven Spielberg, whose credits include the mega-hits \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" and \"E T /' has announced he will execu- tive produce a 20-hour miniseries for DreamWorks TV called \"Taken,\" exploring the subject of alien abduc- tion. Budgeted at $40 million, the series begins shooting this summer and is slated to run during the fall of 2000 on the Sci-Fi Channel in ten 2-hour segments. The di- rector and cast have not been finalized, according to Daily Variety. Spielberg himself created the treatment for the se- ries, which starts from the premise that \"there are ab- ductions-they're real and not made up.\" 1998 Canadian UFO survey shows constant rate of sightings By Chris Rutowski An analysis of 194 UFO sightings reported officially in Canada during 1998 shows that Canadians continue to see many strange things flying in the sky. Ufology Research of Manitoba, working in cooperation with researchers across Canada, has released its review of 1998 Canadian UFO cases leported to private and pub- lic UFO organizations. \"UFO sightings continue to be reported at a fairly constant rate,\" says Chris Rutkowski, an astronomer and science writer in Winnipeg, who for the past 25 years has been studying UFO reports in Canada. \"People still report observing unusual objects in the sky, and some of these objects do not have obvious explanations.\" According to the study, the typical UFO sighting occurs after 10 p.m., most sightings have two witnesses, and many witnesses are pilots, police, and other indi- viduals with reasonably good observing capabilities and good judgement. This year, the study found there was an unexplained increase in the number of UFO reports from the North- west Territories and Yukon. In addition, researchers found that more UFOs in Canada were reported in the fall than at any other time of year. \"We're not sure why there were some odd differ- ences in the patterns of UFO reports last year,\" says Rutkowski, \"but 1998 was definitely not like any other year during the past 10 years of this study.\" While most cases involve star-like objects in the night sky, some witnesses described disc-shaped or triangular objects at close range Although most cases had explanations, a small percentage were not that easy to dismiss. Among the 22 cases listed as \"Unknowns\" this year: • A black triangular object flying low over a truck driver on the Hope-Princeton Highway; • A V-shaped object which affected electrical de- vices in Bancroft, Ontario; • A softball-sized, metallic object hovering over a witness near Emerald Lake, Yukon; and a copper-colored cigar-shaped object which flew over some campers near Blainville, Quebec.

The Brazilian ball of light case cer- tainly is intriguing, as smaller maneuvering objects have been reported off and on for many decades. It is gratifying that one or more finally have been captured on videotape, this time with many indepen- dent witnesses. The \"alien skeleton\" clearly appears to have been a leg-pull, and the perpetrator left many obvious clues to that effect. Why do I get exactly the same impression of Lloyd Pye and his \"mother and child\" human-alien hybrid skulls? I am reminded of Charlie Brown never learning his les- son when Lucy swears that this time she is telling the truth and will not pull the football away when he tries to kick it..and the resulting prattfall when she does ex- actly that. Once again, we should not waste time with sensa- tional claims and proffered \"absolute proof\" physical evidence unless there is a documentary or evidential trail that compels follow-up investigation. As for Tom Deuley's comments on the MJ-12 docu- ments, I can only add a fervent \"Amen!\" This contro- versy does, however, bring to mind something that has bothered me greatly about self-styled \"ufologists,\" in- cluding some MUFON state chapter personnel. Quite a few people have expressed confusion about who they can believe, and an inability to decide who is credible and who is not in the UFO field. Well, start by recognizing that one person's opin- ions are NOT necessarily worth as much as another person's opinions. If you are sick, go to a doctor. If you need legal help, go to a lawyer. If you want to know how highly classified documents are handled, go to someone who has handled them. People who purport to be \"experts\" in the UFO field also should be checked for a track record. Study their writings, their style of expression, their logic, their rea- sonableness, whether they have axes to grind or pre- conceived opinions that they are trying to confirm. Don't be overwhelmed by sexy ideas or flamboyant style, or extravagant claims. Look for substance. End of sermon. Carey and Schmitt's piece on Roswell-related death bed confessions does offer some hope for a final reso- lution of that controversy, if only a few of the hoped- for breakthroughs actually come to pass. I had stated in my May \"Perspective\" that \"We need to seek out the additional witnesses [and] objective people [inves- tigators] with no axes to grind.\" I agree completely with their call for impartial outside analyses of the Ramey memo. In fact, presently uncommitted photo analysts are invited to submit a proposal to the Fund for UFO Research. On the other hand, I am less convinced that the Ramey memo presently constitutes a \"smoking gun.\" Maybe, potentially, but at this point we have no rea- son to be sure that the memo has anything to do with what is going on in the room. For example, it could be a message about an aircraft accident unrelated to the Roswell area UFO crash. It should be possible to learn from historical archives whether any Air Force aircraft accidents occurred on or just before July 8, 1947, in Gen. Ramey's jurisdiction. I would also suggest some research into Air Force activities in the vicinity of Carlsbad, New Mexico, at that time. \"Site Two,\" for that matter, could be an observation post or tracking station of some kind. One final thought. The proliferation of videotapes showing UFOs is reminiscent of Dr. J. Allen Hynek's remark about an \"embarassment of riches.\" Just as in other areas, we need more independent, professional photoanalysis work by uncommitted parties. The ideal would be a professional photoanalysis firm willing to help defray the costs for the sake of science and for some publicity, in which case the Fund for UFO Re- search or the' UFO Research Coalition might be able to support some analysis work if the appropriate evi- dence is available. Complete camera and film data, description of date and circumstances, reference points on the film, and eyewitness testimony would be the basic essentials.

Then it vanishes in the solar glare, moving to the morning sky on the 20th. Mars (0.2), in Libra, stays low in the SW at twi- light, setting later in the W about 11 PM (mid-August). Both Jupiter (-2.6) and Saturn (-0.1) can be found in Aries, rising in the E about half an hour apart (about 10:30 and 11 PM, respectively). The two giant planets are becoming brighter, though Jupiter is about ten times the brightness of Saturn. Each begins retrograding westward this month, Jupiter on the 25th and Satum,on the 30th. The former is 4 degrees N of the quarter Moon on August 3; Saturn lies 3 degrees N of the Moon the next evening. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mercury is favorably placed in the ENE at dawn in midmonth. Jupiter and Saturn cross the southern sky, arriving at a location high in the SSE at dawn. Total Solar Eclipse: On August 11 Earth will experience its last total eclipse of the Sun in this millennium, but only within a narrow path no more than 70 miles wide. The path of totality sweeps eastward across the North Atlantic, SW England, central Europe, the Black Sea, Middle East, and India. Maximum.totality is 2 minutes 23 seconds in Romania. Meanwhile a sunrise partial eclipse will be seen in the U.S. E of a line running from Northern Michigan through NE Ohio to eastern Virginia. Since the eclipse will be near or past maximum obscuration as the Sun rises, observers must be sure of a clear unobstructed ENE horizon. The area of the Sun's disc covered by the Moon varies from only a few percent at the ex- treme western and southern portions of the zone to around 85% in parts of Maine. Even though the solar disc in the U.S. and eastern Canada is somewhat dimmed near the horizon, it is sensible to use either a #14 welder's filter in front of the eyes to insure safe viewing, or to project the Sun's image through a telescope eyepiece onto a white sur- face. Elsewhere those within the totality path can safely watch the totally eclipsed Sun with the unaided eye. Meteor Shower: Unlike last year, the Perseids will have no Moon in the sky to interfere with the observation of this reli- able annual display on the mornings of August 12 and 13. While the meteors' radiant point (from which the Perseids appear) is in the northern sky all night, the shower is best seen at its maximum rate during the morning hours and especially toward dawn. Then be- tween 50 and 100 bright yellowish meteors per hour may be seen, many blossoming into conspicuous fire- balls. Moon Phases: Last quarter-August 4 New moon-August 11 First quarter-August 18 Full moon—August 26 € O The Stars: The Milky Way arches across the heavens from N to S at this time. The faint river of starlight represents the edge-on view we have of our wheel-shaped home galaxy of billions of stars. You must escape to a dark rural setting far from city lights in order to enjoy the delicate beauty of the Milky Way. The Summer Triangle (stars Vega, Deneb, Altair) maintains its dominant position in the S, with Vega shining almost directly overhead at 10 PM. The bril- liant star is 3rd brightest in the Northern Hemisphere night sky (after Sirius and Arcturus).

Congratulations and accolades to Susan L. Swiatek, the symposium coordinator, and her fantastic committee that made this event such an enjoyable affair. Our thanks are also extended to the wonderful speak- ers who graced the podium, and for their published papers in the symposium proceedings. For those of you who were unable to attend this year's annual symposium and hear the speakers in per- son, their presentations are published in the MUFON 1999 International UFO Symposium Proceeding (201 pages) that may be purchased from MUFON in Seguin, TX, for $25 plus $1.75 for postage and handling. The cover design, depicting a few of the national buildings in Washington, DC, with fireworks exploding over the reflecting pools, printed on blue over white, was sub- mitted by Liz Coleson, a professional graphic artist. The 1999 Symposium Proceedings were respectfully dedicated to Dwight Connelly, the current editor of the MUFON UFO Journal and former editor of SKYLOOK for his journalistic talent and accomplish- ments. The August 1999 edition of \\h& Journal will feature the symposium speakers with photographs and short commentaries of their speeches. Information will also be provided where video tapes of the speakers may be obtained and the tape prices.

It was published for the purpose of attract- ing UFO interest by high-level government officials, European dignitaries, and influential news media per- sonnel. The book was supported and financed by Laurance S. Rockefeller. This important book was in demand by the UFO Community, but was not available, pending a contract for the widespread publishing by a \"name publisher.\" Since such a contract was not awarded, MUFON has a small quantity of books available for $20 plus $1.75 for postage and handling. \"The Best Available Evi- dence\" is all that the title implies, and is highly recom- mended by the UFO Research Coalition. MUFON UFO BALLOT INITIATIVE MUFON has established a checking account at the Frost National Bank in San Antonio, TX, to deposit checks made out to \"MUFON UFO Ballot Initiative,\" a fundraising project for supporting this program, as requested by Larry Bryant and Robert H. Bletchman, co-chairmen. Checks should be made payable to the above account and mailed to MUFON in Seguin, TX, for deposit. We thank you in advance for your contri- butions. A check for $100 opened the account. Most people in ufology have been critical of the fed- eral government and the U.S. Air Force for trying to (Continued on Page 23)"}]
