The participation by sociologists as well as physical scientists, engineers, theologians, and many others directly reflects the complexity of UFO phenomena. Social scientists and psychologists, particularly, can play an important role. A special caucus or panel of behavioral scientists might be a good feature for next year's symposium in Houston, Texas. Meanwhile, the northern California MUFON contingent—Paul Gerny, Stan Friedman, Jim McCampbell, Tom Gates, Marvin Taylor, Richard Haines, and all the rest—receive our plaudits for a job extremely well done.

Since the second theme was \"Stressing Public Education of the UFO Phenomena,\" multiple programs were being conducted simultaneously that would appeal to both the scientific community and the general public. This article is being prepared for the people around the world who were unable to attend in person. Attendance has been estimated at 1,400-1,500 people. A brief review of the 11 featured speakers' papers that are published in the 1979 MUFON UFO Symposium Pro- ceedings is included. Publicity for the symposium successfully utilized all media: newspapers, the international wire services, radio, television, magazines, and public appearances by committee members. An attractive UFO art and photo exhibit on the mezzanine greeted all arrivals to the Airport Marina Hotel. After short greetings and a welcome from Tom Gates, Conference Chairman, and Walt Andrus, International Director, the audience selected one of four speeches or programs to attend that was the most appealing to their personal interests. It would be impossible to review each of the informative talks given, but we want to thank each of these speakers for their contributions to the finest symposium ever conducted by MUFON. On Saturday morning, in addition to the featured speakers, the following people made presentations: Marvin E. Taylor, Assistant State Director for Northern California - \"Investigators Workshop\"; William H. Spaulding, Director GSW - \"Three Decades of UFOs and Holding\"; Tom Gates, Astronomer • \"The Zeta Reticuli Model\"; Thomas F. Bearden - \"Investigators Workshop\" on his speech; David Swift, Ph.D., Sociologist from University of Hawaii, Honolulu, \"Who Believes in UFOs?\"; and then one of the most popular events of the symposium titled \"Witness Case Workshop.\" Paul Cerny, MUFON Western States Director, introduced and interviewed selected witnesses of close encounter cases and abductees living in the northern California area. The audience had an opportunity to personally meet and listen to Judy Kendall, Grace OMara, Bill Pecha, Anita Sowles, and Helen White tell their experiences. In addition to these events, the Allan F. Sandier color motion picture film \"UFOs, Past, Present and Future,\" narrated by Rod Serling,- was shown at periodic intervals throughout the symposium. . The Saturday afternoon programs included a hypnosis workshop by Jean Richards, therapist, titled \"Hypnosis Session and Demonstration\"; Witness Case Workshop, James N. Hershey, Ph.D., theologian, titled \"My Personal Encounters with- UFOs, Including Telepathy\"; Walt Andrus, \"UFO Photographs\"; James M. McCampbell, 'Technology of UFOs\"; Alvin H. Lawson, Ph.D., \"Abduction Analogs: Parallels With Other Altered Awareness States\"; Tom Page, educator, \"A Personal Account of a Close Encounter\"; Terry Hartman, State Director for Oregon, \"Mind Development, Telepathic Conscious- ness, Other Life Forms\"; Marvin Taylor, \"UFOs, A Reality to Be Dealt With\"; and Richard F. Haines, Ph.D., \"Everything You've Wanted to Know About Witness Drawings, But Been Afraid to Ask.\" On Sunday morning, while the MUFON Annual Corporate Meeting was taking place, the following gentlemen were giving presentations in other rooms: Stanton T. Friedman, \"UFO Propulsion Systems\"; Tom Gates, \"A Discussion of the Andreasson Affair\"; and Terry Hartman, \"Entities Among' Us.\" Sunday afternoon special programs consisted of various workshops such as Ted Peters, Ph.D. and David Stupple, Ph.D., \"Religious and Social Workshop\"; William Spaulding and Stanton Friedman, \"Dealing with the Media,\" Part I and Part D, with short talks by Bob Trebor of KGO Radio, Walt Andrus, Tom Gates, Allen Hynek, James McCampbell, and Marvin Taylor; \"Government Involvement Workshops\" with William Spaulding and Stanton Friedman. An unscheduled but very popular addition to the symposium was the New Zealand motbn picture film made December 31, 1978, that was shown and narrated by Bruce Maccabee, Ph.D., MUFON State Director for Maryland. By starting, stopping on individual frames, slow motion, and reversing segments, Bruce gave an analysis of his study that has been published in the May and June issues of the MUFON UFO Journal. And if this wasn't enough, for an added thrill, David Crockett — the photographer who made the film — was at the symposium with his new 30-minute videotape documentary covering this monumental event. His videotape depicts the entire experience including interviews with the pilots, radar operators, and film crew as they re- enact their part in this sighting. Three major factors — multiple witness visual sighting, radar confirmation from both (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"(Symposium, Continued) ground and aircraft units, and a motion picture film — thoroughly document this UFO case as authentic and substantial evidence that a UFO was observed. Rocky Wood, a New Zealand UFO legist, also attended the symposium and assisted with the showing of the films and videotape. One of the most impressive aspects of the motion picture film was the direct contrast of motion from an apparently hovering attitude to the fantastic speed where in one frame of film, the object moved through a pattern like the ampersand on a typewriter (&). Since this article is aimed toward those people who could not attend due to the vast distances to be traveled, we are showing numerous photographs of the speakers, symposium committee members, \"gophers,\" and a few attendees. Every person involved in the planning and implementation of this symposium from the host Northern California group is to be congratulated and highly commended for the largest and finest symposium in our 10-year history. At other symposiums the wives of the host committee could always be counted on for help, however, at the San Francisco symposium practically all of the beautiful and gracious ladies were individual members who devoted untold hours of their time to make this prestigious event a success — roses to these gorgeous gals. Another innovation at this symposium was the ever-presence of young men (mostly teenagers) performing vital functions and each being proudly identified by their large round badges as \"Gophers.\" With both of these groups working with the host committee and State Section Directors, \"our hats are off' to these folks for a job well done. The international atmosphere abounded at this conference with participants from Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, and a large contingent from Canada headed by Henry McKay, our Canadian Regional Director. FORBIDDEN FRONTIER — COMMUNICATIONS WITH UFONAUTS By James M. McCampbell (MUFON Director for Research, Belmont, California) Jim's speech and published paper was inspired by MUFON's fourth basic question: \"Assuming that some craft are piloted by beings (humanoids or entities), what can we leam from the apparently advanced science and civilization through study or possibly through direct communications with the occupants of these vehicles?\" That was a bold statement of the problem 10 years ago when the idea of direct communication was so tainted with prejudice, incredulity, controversy, and revulsion. At that time, even some UFO research groups could hardly bring themselves to admit that UFOs might have pilots or to acknowledge that prospect in public. Jim then proceeded to develop different facets of the study. The paragraph titles will whet your appetite to secure a copy of the 1979 MUFON UFO SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS. They consist of \"Hello, Out There!\", \"Cosmic Post Cards\", \"Religious Vigils\", \"Electromagnetic Shouting\", \"Eavesdropping on the E-M Spectrum\", \"Search for Extra- terrestrial Life\", \"Paranormal Approaches\", \"Accidental Contacts,\" and \"Official Contact.\" The \"Role of Science\" section makes the following observations, evaluations, and recommendations to answer the fourth basic question: \"Scientists may be justifiably criticized 4 for being overly conservative and impatient with new facts that disrupt their beliefs. Science itself, however, should not be reviled. It is the history of the intellectual achievement of mankind. It is the body of reliable information on every topic and the methods that were employed to acquire it. That knowledge is obtained through experimentation with extreme care and accurate reporting. Analysis of results must be mathematically valid. The work must be published broadly and subject to open debate. Research fulfilling these requirements produces new scientific knowledge that is generally accepted. \"Consider 'Science* to be a giant circle enclosing all knowledge that is reliable and universally accepted. One may reasonably inquire, 'What lies outside?' The answer is 'vast realms of the unexpected.' Relativity was one. All sorts of human experiences that are poorly understood lie out there. Some would include the subject of UFOs, and direct communication with UFOnauts. Somewhere out in the 'south forty' one would find telepathy, telekinesis, unexplained disappearances in the Bermuda Triangle, Bigfoot, psychic healing, and the like. Because of continued research in numerous fields, it is the nature of science to expand,, eventually engulfing some of those areas formally lying outside its circle. \"This concept well applies to the question of communication with UFOnauts. The subject is amenable to scientific research that could lead to its general acceptance and many avenues are open: a) study of the early contactees; b) evaluation of current claims of psychic communications; c) detailed investigation of current cases where communication with humanoids is claimed; d) continued emphasis on abductions; e) technical investigation of cases involving electronic devices such as radios, TV, tape recorders; f) design and performance experiments permitting verification of contact with UFOnauts; and g) utilizing legal means to leam what the world goverments know. A scientific approach to the study of communication with UFOnauts is a challenging and potentially rewarding experience. It may be hoped that Members and Consultants of MUFON will contribute significantly to eventual communication with UFOnauts that is established on scientific principles, is demonstrable, repeatable, reliable, and universally accepted.\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"THE RELIGIOUS DIMENSION TO THE UFO PHENOMENON By Ted Peters (MUFON Consultant in Theology) Do unidentifed flying objects have anything to do with religion? Sociologist Andrew Greely says UFOs along with science fiction give us something which our modern churches have lost, namely a sense of \"wonder.\" Famed psychoanalyst Carl Jung wrote 20 years ago that flying saucers represent collective psychic distress and the desire for supernatural salvation. Carl Sagan, Cornell University exobiologist, who directed the search for life on the Viking probe of Mars, says with derision that UFO believers project religious fantasies onto phenomena that only science can fully explain. Many skeptics think they have dealt the death blow to UFOs by hurling phrases such as \"true believers,\" religious kooks,\" and \"lunatic fringe.\" But these identifications'of UFOs with religion often are haphazard, superficial, and slanderous. If there is a connection between UFOs and religion, then the time is ripe for a serious scholarly study of the matter. With this introduction to his published paper, Dr. Peters proceeds to develop pertinent questions and answers under the headings of (1) Transcendence, (2) Omniscience, (3) Perfection, (4) Redemption (5) Theology and Extraterrestrial Life, (6) Should We Heed the UFO Message? and (7) Possible UFOlatry? A few quotes from Ted's concluding remarks are very significant in relating his personal thinking in this regard. \"Neither traditional theology nor the established church hierarchy is likely to crumble with the advent of even the most startling UFO revelations. But there should be a note of caution. As people begin to make an emotional investment in UFOs and pin their hopes upon them, the situation is ripe for idolatry. In this case, we may call it \"ufolatry.\" An important ingredient in the Hebrew and Christian faiths is trust in God. Whatever we trust we worship. To trust in anything other than God Himself is to violate the First Commandment. It places an idol before God.\" Dr. Peters goes on to say: \"We have learned to place a great deal of trust and confidence in technology to solve our practical problems during this century. There is a constant temptation to elevate technology, to view it as the solver of our moral and spiritual problems, as well as the practical. UFOs present our imaginations with the possibility of a superterrestrial technology dedicated to meeting all our moral and spiritual needs. How we wish they could end war, stimulate love and brotherhood, provide peace on earth. But these are problems concerning the relationship between the human heart and the divine will. They can be solved only through God's work in our lives. No technology can do it, whether it be terrestrial or extraterrestrial. To place one's trust in UFOs is to build a house on sand.\" Ted sums up his speech by reiterating the meanings in the prior paragraph..\"UFOs resonate within our culture with a disguised symbolism making us aware that our religious sensibilities are still alive and well within our secularized and technologized culture. But there is still reason for caution. UFOs may represent an unconcious hope that technology will save us from all our ills. But such a hope fails to recognize the some of our ills are due to problems with the human heart. From these God and God alone is able to deliver us.\" INFORMATION RETRIEVALS: A CASE FOR UFO COVER-UP By William H. Spaulding (Director of G.S.W. and MUFON State Director for Arizona) Civilian UFO researchers have long asserted that United States intelligence agencies are aware of the existence and origin of UFOs. Throughout the past 25-plus years many individuals, both in and out of the UFO field, have.maintained that the government knew more about the phenomenon that it was telling. Each time an interesting encounter transpired, one that gained public recognition, government officials would beat the incident to death with statements which bordered on the ridiculous. The old standby of \"probably a weather balloon\" or \"possibly the planet Venus viewed during unusual conditions\" worked very successfully. Bill and some key people — W. Todd Zechel, Peter Gersten, and Brad Sparks — were convinced that the intelligence agencies knew far more about the UFO mystery than they would admit. The new Freedom of Information Act gave them the legal tool to break open \"pandora's box.\" In his paper, Bill only exposes \"the tip of the iceberg,\" since more important documents exist within the voluminous goverment files. Citizens Against UFO Secrecy (CAUS) has demonstrated that through persistent effort, these vital documents may be obtained via the Freedom of Information Act. vehicle. Mr. Spaulding, in his paper, quotes from the 1,000 documents already received, during their 14 long and gruelling months of legal maneuvers, tremendous costs, and long hours of researching the CIA and other intelligence agencies. In conclusion, Bill has made this recommendation. \"Now is the time for. all UFO researchers to collectively apply pressure to the CIA and its offspring in the intelligence community which are suppressing information. Every effort should be made to utilize the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to the fullest extent of the law, within our means, to secure this valuable material.\" .

Greenawald For the years 1975 and 1976, 760 newspaper articles dealing with the UFO phenomena in the U.S.A. were reviewed. The following areas were examined for pertinent conclusions: (1) UFO sighting categories (NL, DD, CE1, CE2, CE3); (2) UFO sighting rates by state; and (3) UFO biases of newspaper reporters and papers. In the introduction to his paper, Mr. Greenawald had this to say, \"During the past 32 years every newspaper reporting timely news has probably published at least several articles on the UFO phenomena....a subject of general interest to an average reader. Since new UFO information is relatively scarce, UFO related items in any newspaper are worthy of careful scrutiny by serious UFO researchers as they may very well be the starting point of a new UFO adventure. Initially this effort started out as a simple study of UFO classification types, but continued study of the raw data led to unexpected results possibly of interest to other UFOlogists. The UFO CLIPPING SERVICE, a monthly publication from Seattle, Washington (Rod B. Dyke), was the data source for the report. Each issue of 20 legal-size pages costing $5.00, contained the following approximate content: (1) 60% domestic UFO items; (2) 20% foreign UFO items (mostly English); (3) 20% Forteana subjects (Bigfoot, Loch Ness Monster, Big Bird, Cattle Mutilations).\" Mr. Greenawald then proceeded to categorize the results of his study. Two of his conclusions bear out the thoughts and feelings of most UFOlogists. The majority of new UFO sightings as reported in newspapers . come from small-town publications. Large city papers are more prone to be anti-UFO and rarely report local sightings. News reporters ranged from complete disbelief to complete acceptance of the reality of UFOs. A group polled was decidedly more in favor of the reality of UFOs despite the fact that they were not well informed on the subject, which is consistent with the general public.

Lawson A few comments from the introduction of Dr. Lawson's paper and the abstract will set the stage for his presentation. \"The two thousand or so UFO entity reports have presented ufology with a. fascinating but bewildering array of descriptions of supposed alien life forms. While many seem recognizably human, humanoid, animal, or robotic, there are frequent accounts of seemingly unique creatures which are anatomically bizarre, ghostly, or similarly resistant to categorization. The situation has resulted in a confusing if not chaotic body of literature about entities. Previous studies have helped prepare for a much-needed entity classification system, but more work of this kind should be done.\" Dr. Lawson's abstract to his paper is quoted verbatim. \"Descriptions are offered for six classes of UFO entities (human, humanoid, animal, robot, exotic, and apparitional) which account for most reports of supposed alien visitors. This six-category system is supported by a similar six-part classification which is readily found among creatures from traditional sources such as mythology, folklore, and fantasy literature. \"Although few UFO entity descriptions lie outside these categories, scientists have proposed several intelligent alien life forms which cannot thus be classified. The rarity of such CE-ffls implies that UFO entity types are more closely connected to traditional models than to actual observations. \"In addition, image-parallels with folklore, science fiction, and hypnosis narratives indicate that UFO entity descriptions involve Jungian archetypes which are in the minds of witnesses before they ever have a CE- m experience. It follows that, while actual perceptions of entities may be stimulated in witnesses by the UFO phenomenon, the entities merely indicate that a stimulus is present; they tell nothing about the nature of the stimulus. \"Various explanations are suggested for category similarities between UFO entities and traditional creatures, but there are many persistent and unanswered questions. Only continued research into CE-ffl cases will determine whether such accounts relate more directly to outer or to inner space.\""},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"CONTACTEES, CULTS, AND CULTURE By David Stupple (MUFON (MUFON Consultant in Sociology) 1 and William McNeece Religious cults traditionally have been a source of amusement to outsiders; but since the Jamestown mass suicide, amusement has changed to fear. Since we correctly sense that cult organizations are inherently unstable, cult members are assumed to be irrational. In so many words, the man-in-the-street, and the research scientist alike, openly wonder: \"What is wrong with these people that they think strange thoughts and act in a bizarre manner?\" In this paper David and William argue that this pathological model of cult membership is both gratuitous and inaccurate. The success of a cult, at least a flying saucer cult, requires the existence of four factors: (1) a mystagogue, (2) an epistemic community, (3) a seedbed subculture from which members are recruited, and .(4) personnel with requisite skills and motivation to perform the tasks required for the cult's ongoing life. Dr. Stupple and Mr. McNeece then proceed ,to discuss the first three of these factors and then consider their application to a concrete example — the Institute for Cosmic Science, a McNeece charming, if disarming, Detroit area flying saucer cult that, during the period 1967-1974, involved over 100 persons who, at one time or another, worked on the construction of a flying saucer that they hoped would fly into outer space and save Earth from impending disaster. (The Institute for Cosmic Science is a pseudonym and the names of its participants have also been changed.) This is a true story, with many lessons to learn, as viewed by two competent sociologists. INVESTIGATION AND ANALYSIS OF SOUND PULSES RECORDED DURING A PERIOD OF UFO ACTIVITY IN BRAGG CREEK, ALBERTA, CANADA By Dennis R. Regan and William K. Allan Dr. Regan, MUFON Consultant in Aeroacoustics, tackled one of the more difficult subjects in UFOlogy when he elected to analyze sounds emitted by UFOs, since so few documented recordings exist. With the help of several people, including William Allan, he concentrated upon two specific incidents in his laboratory study conducted in 1975. In his introductory comments, Dennis reviewed the various sounds associated with UFOs such as humming, buzzing, whistling, whirring, whining, beeping, swishing, and hissing. Because different witnesses may use different descriptive terminology to describe the same sound, Dennis has grouped the sounds in terms of relative frequency. Low-frequency sounds (humming, buzzing and whirring) are placed in one category and high- frequency sound (beeping, whistling, whining, hissing, etc.) are in the second group. The existence of low and high- frequency sounds implies that perhaps there are at least two different types of sound-producing UFOs or two different modes of UFO sound production. The beeping sound classified in the high-frequency group deserves special attention because of its unique characteristics and is discussed in detail in this paper. Copies of both tapes were made by William K. Allan in 1968 from actual cases in Canada that he investigated and submitted to Dennis for analysis. The complete background on the sightings and tape recordings is reviewed by Dr. Regan and Bill Allan in their paper. Dennis has included in the 1979 MUFON UFO Symposium Proceedings, a diagram of the experimental setup used to analyze the tape recordings, listing all of the commercially available test equipment and instruments, so that others may utilize his research in the field of UFO sounds. (The laboratory test equipment used is commercially available, but more expensive than the home experimenter or ham radio operator might have on his or her test bench. Both Dennis and Bill are amateur radio operators.) His paper is divided into sections titled The Bragg Creek Incident, The Midnapore Recording, Sound Analysis, Things that go beep in the night, and Conclusions. Section 7 on Recommendations for Future Research is quoted from his paper. \"During the course of this investigation, it became apparent that a significant number of birds inhabiting North America make sounds that would be classified by most people as a beeping sound. It is highly recommended that UFO investigators become familiar with the beeping sounds made by birds indigenous to the region of interest through the many recordings of bird calls that are commercially available. With regards to the present investigation, more studies are needed of the beeping sounds made by the Pygmy and Saw-whet Owl. In particular, we need to know, if it is indeed possible for these latter owls to produce an extremely long series of sound pulses with a high degree of regularity without chirps or raspiness.\" Dr. Regan is to be commended for • research into UFO sounds. Journal readers who have access to recorded sounds emanating from a UFO should contact either Dr. Dennis R. Regan or MUFON at 103 Oldtowne Road, Sequin, TX 78155.

Haines Probably the best way of reviewing the data that Dr. Haines presented is to quote dire«tly from the introduction, since this provides the background and validity for the study. \"There are five major reasons for reviewing sightings of anomalous phenomena from aircraft; First, pilots and other crew members tend to be educated, stable people who are taught to recognize a wide variety of meteorological and other aerial phenomena; they are also trained to be observant — to see and be seen during flight. As pilots accumulate more and more flight time they also have an opportunity to see and identify unusual illusory effects in nature. These factors tend to enchance their reliability as witnesses. This is not to say that pilots are not as subject to certain motion- induced (and other) visual illusions as observers on the ground but, rather, that pilots are more likely than not to be good eye witnesses. \"The second reason is the unique vantage point from which the sighting can take place. Aircraft flying high above the earth make it possible to view the aerial phenomenon below them, seen against the earth background. This is important in helping to establish the maximum distance to the phenomenon, a far more difficult task when the phenomenon is seen against a sky background. Not only this but pilots usually have available a wide field of view and they can quickly maneuver. their aircraft to see in other directions as well. \"Third, almost all commercial, military, and research aircraft and even some private aircraft are equipped with a wide range of on-board equipment helpful in detecting, reporting, and even analyzing certain characteristics of the phenomenon encountered. Radar transmitters and receivers, UFH and VHP radios, radio-magnetic and gyro- 8 compasses, automatic direction finders, air temperature and pressure sensors, and other standard equipment can become important during aerial sightings. The rapid use of the aircraft's radio can also alert ground monitoring facilities to search the skies for the phenomenon over a broad geographic region and can request the visual search assistance of other pilots flying in the vicinity. The pilot can also request detailed weather information via the radio so as to determine if the phenomenon might somehow. be associated with a particular weather pattern. \"The fourth reason is namely that, particularly for commercial aircraft flying at high altitudes, the possibility that;the phenomenon is bird, prank balloon, or other deliberately contrived hoax launched from the air becomes smaller and smaller with increasing altitude. \"The fifth reason for studying sightings by pilots is the fact that professional pilots have reputations at stake. What is the basis of this statement? It is that most commercial airlines conduct specially prepared screening programs for candidate air crews in order to try to eliminate those individuals who are psychologically unstable, those who are unable to cope with stress in an appropriate manner, those who cannot assume a leadership role as their professional career continues, and those who cannot demonstrate an ability to make rapid, sound judgements in emergencies. And thus, by predisposition, selection, and training, pilots tend to possess such traits as leadership, dominance, alertness, j achievement, and consistency of behavior to mention a few. Maintenance of such a public and corporate image is very important. Therefore, if pilots do come forward with details of an airborne sighting it is reasonable to believe that they have, indeed, seen something very strange to them, strange enough to file a report and risk some degree of ridicule. \"Certainly, the above is not to suggest that pilots are less (or more) likely to perceive illusory effects or misinterpret a natural phenomenon about which they may know little. Rather, it is reasonable to assume that pilots will be more likely to test a wide variety of hypotheses concerning the sighting before making their report and, if a particular hypothesis is reasonable, they will probably not make a formal report. \"To help improve the chances of obtaining reliable sighting details of truly anomalous aerial phenomena only sightings by two or more persons on- board the aircraft were analyzed here. And, to help reduce the chances that the phenomenon (or object) was a weather or research balloon, a bird, or meteor, the duration of the sightings was taken into account. In general, the lower the sighting altitude (i.e., the altitude of the phenomenon) the longer the duration had to be to be included here. \"Troy Challenger and the author reviewed a total of more than 300 sightings from the air for the period 1947 to 1959. The present reveiw is meant as a continuation of this earlier review. The interested reader should also consult the following articles involving pilot sightings from the air (Greenawald, 1977; Ruppelt, 1956; Shanklin, 1955; Wichman, 1971; Wilkins, 1954; Zeidman, 1978; Zigel, 1968). The objective of this paper is to present the results of a review of aerial sightings predominantly by pilots for the period 1 January 1973 through 31 December 1978.\""},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"A MIND/BRAIN/MATTER MODEL CONSISTENT WITH QUANTUM PHYSICS AND UFO PHENOMENON By Thomas E. Bearden (MUFON Consultant in Nuclear Physics) In his paper Mr. Bearden introduces a model of mind and matter and their interaction that is consistent with the entire experimental basis of physics, and which offers mechanisms for paranormal phenomena of all types, including the UFO phenomena. The model is speculative since certain conclusions drawn by the author from quantum mechanics and other sources are not generally held by most scientists. Certain conclusions are reached by a new \"fourth law of logic\" advanced by the author and not yet generally accepted by the scientific community at large. Without a doubt, Tom Bearden's paper was the most technical speech delivered at the symposium. By utilizing projected transparencies on a screen and confining his vocabulary to avoid technical words, he held the audience spellbound with his dynamic delivery. After stating 16 principles in his paper for a base of understanding, he divided the paper into the following subjects: (1) A Four-law logical solution of the problem of mind; (2) Mind, life, and consciousness; (3) Layers of unconsciousness; (4) Dreams and the collective unconscious; (5) The Cold War, psychotronics, and UFOs; (6)' Cattle mutilations; (7) A final numbing possibility; and (8) Conclusion. The majority of the participants at the symposium could not comprehend the formulas Mr. Bearden has used in his paper; they are for the mathematical physicist who is qualified to explore and expand this line of reasoning. (In the 1978 MUFON UFO Symposium Proceedings, Illobrand von Ludwiger submitted a paper that delved into the mathematics and physics of other dimensions, to explain the UFO phenomenon in Part n. After studying Part II, Tom Bearden stated that Illobrand von Ludwiger has done an outstanding job in presenting Burkhard Heim's \"Unified quantum field theory of matter and gravitation\" and personally endorses his work.) It would not be feasible in this brief review of the 1979 MUFON Symposium to go any deeper into Mr. Bearden's work, however, we encourage qualified people to do so with these words of encouragement from Tom. Again, we do not wish to present this work as \"finished.\" Instead, it is only just begun. However, we do point out that the theory is directly applicable to practical devices, and that one or more devices operating along these lines has actually been built. Finally, we wish to stress the importance of recognition of \"virtual state\" as a complete kind of reality already used in physics, and the necessity for earnest study and experiment toward the ability to directly engineer the virtual state itself. If one can control the virtual state, one can control all electric charge and electromagnetics, hence all chemistry and all physical effects and interactions. We also urge an end to the resistance to the study of \"mind\" in physics. Quantum mechanics itself has long since reduced physics to the study of the relations between perceptions; indeed it has nothing at all to say about a possible concrete world lying behind its equations, as Margenau and Lindsay pointed out.

Allen Hynek (Director, Center for UFO Studies) Dr. Hynek's paper this year was somewhat of a . continuation of. his speech from the. 1978 MUFON Symposium, which was entitled, \"UFOs as a Space Time Singularity.\" He discussed one of the outstanding characteristics of the UFO phenomenon, which sets it apart from the \"nuts and bolts\" hardware world that we are all acquainted with. While the UFO decidedly has physical aspects — it can be photographed, picked up on radar, emits light and sound, makes imprints on the ground, can break tree branches, stop cars; ; and; cause many physiological effectsybii; man and animal — it differs in one great; respect. Almost always it is reported in\" one location and then is reported to- disappear, but who sees it next?

The motion picture \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" made talking about UFOs more socially accepted and flushed more old reports to the surface. A sequel to this picture and a planned reissue of the film in the Spring of 1980 may bring out even more \"oldies and goodies.\" The Legion of the Bewildered Silent will always be with us until the \"ridicule curtain\" or \"ridicule barrier\" is finally demolished. Dr. Hynek continues to probe the question of how we get people to report their sightings. Whether the witnesses are sophisticated and worldlywise, or simple and naive, they are still puzzled and bewildered. He then relates his public contacts from several sources confirming the fact that the present reports are only the \"tip of the iceberg.\" The ridicule factor may be diminished by reporting sightings to reputable and responsible UFO organizations, where one can report in complete confidence and with dignity. Allen reflects that it is a pity that the tabloid press, which have ample funds for investigation, cannot be enlisted by the responsible UFO organizations for financial aid. But as long as the media seek only sensational stories with which to titillate their readers and make no attempt at deeper studies, all that can accrue is unfavorable publicity for the UFO witnesses and consequent ridicule. On the other hand, it is also quite necessary that the ufologists to whom the confidential information has been entrusted have the freedom and the time to do justice to the particular case. After the data have been collected, collated, and studied, the case should rapidly be made available to the general field by being published or at least a synopsis distributed to students of the subject everywhere. In such a publication, it is still necessary in most cases to keep the name of the reporters confidential. It is the content of the report, and not the names of the witnesses, that is important. Pseudonyms can be used without destroying the validity of the report, so long as the caliber of the witness is carefully stated. Dr. Hynek took this opportunity to point out that affiliations with one UFO organization or another, while very important in one respect, can be roadblocks to research. MUFON and the Center for UFO Studies have maintained a friendly cooperation these past several years, and he hopes that will continue. However, UFO investigators and researchers should talk and respect each other for what they have done, what they know and have published so they may exchange ideas. He also advocated regional UFO research groups so as to make attending meetings more frequent and less expensive. THE CASE FOR THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL ORIGIN OF FLYING SAUCERS By Stanton T. Friedman Since Stanton Friedman used documented material from his nationwide college and university presentation titled \"Flying Saucers Are Real\" in his MUFON Symposium lecture, the original material published in the 1979 MUFON UFO symposium Proceedings is more appropriate in reviewing his talk. Abstract \"Careful review of a vast array of relevant evidence clearly leads to the conclusion that SOME unidentified flying objects are intelligently controlled vehicles whose origin is outside our solar system. All the arguments against the extraterrestrial origin seem to be based upon false reasoning, misrepresentation of evidence, neglect of relevant information, ignorance of relevant technology, or pseudo- sophisticated assumptions about alien appearance, motivation, .or government secrecy. 12 Introduction \"The most important step in the determination of the origin of flying saucers is to ask the proper question. That question is not \"How can they get here?\" or \"where do UFOs come from?\" or \"are all UFOs ET spacecraft?\" or even \"why don't they do this or that?\" The proper question is \"Are ANY UFOs ET spacecraft?\" To answer this question requires review of both the evidence indicating SOME flying saucers are ET vehicles and the arguments raised in objection. While all flying saucers are by definition UFOs, few UFOs are flying saucers. Thus the definition of \"Flying Saucer\" is \"an unusual object in the sky or on the ground whose appearance clearly indicates it was manufactured and whose behavior in conjunction with its appearance clearly indicates a non- Earth origin.\" It is very important to recognize that determining that some flying saucers are of ET origin is much simpler than determining the mode of propulsion, home base, or purpose of the visit of each individual saucer. There is no easy way of obtaining answers to these and many other important questions. But they need not be answered to establish the ET origin of some flying saucers. \"It must also be acknowledged that there may be as wide a variety of origins, alien humanoid types, alien motivations, and vehicle models as there are types of vehicles, people, and travel motivations at O\"Hare Airport. Furthermore, our present inability to duplicate UFO flight behavior in the atmosphere or to buy tickets for a quick interstellar trip tells us nothing about whether or not a more advanced civilization has been accomplishing these difficult-to-us feats for a long time. It is also extremely important to recognize that a particular vehicle and its inhabitants may well originate in another solar system without necessarily having just flown to or from that solar system in the observed"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"vehicle. Our own navies have for many years used huge aircraft carriers to carry dozens of very much smaller aircraft to the local area in which the aircraft make frequent short haul trips. That the residents of the area over which the aircraft fly rarely see the carrier doesn't mean it isn't nearby, just as the fact that the airplane is incapable (by itself) of returning to its nation or origin doesn't mean it can't get there \"piggy-back.\" .Evidence \"The primary UFO evidence consists of UFO sighting reports, multi- witness close encounters, still and motion pictures, radar trackings, simultaneous radar-visual sightings, physical traces (environmental changes in dirt, vegetation, trees, etc.) produced by UFOs, abductions by aliens of Earthlings, and very likely (in hidden locations) crashed UFOs and preserved alien bodies. The world-wide origin of the various data collections indicate similar experiences occurring and being reported independently all over the planet. The overall quality and quantity of reports is far better than most people — especially open minded sceptics and scientists and newspaper reporters — are aware. \"The primary difficulty is that there is too much data, not too little, and that it is scattered and uneven and not readily available at most libraries. The good evidence is mixed with a much greater number of low-quality reports of lights in the sky and small numbers of crackpot and hoax reports. That there are a few such reports should come as no surprise considering the fact that police everywhere receive a multitude of useless tips in which are mixed a few very important leads. Also, as any police artist would testify, most people are far better at recognizing unknown persons and things than at describing them. \"The fact is that most sightings are not very exciting and that most can be explained in relatively conventional terms. It cannot be stressed too strongly that this fact is quite irrelevant to the search for truth about UFOs. It is certainly a fact that most chemicals cure no disease, that most people are not 7 feet tall, that most isotopes are not fissionable, that most people cannot run a mile in less than 4 minutes, that most people do not commit murder, and that most metal is not gold. All of these facts in no way change the real facts that some few chemicals do cure diseases, some few people are 7 feet tall, some few isotopes are fissionable, some few people can run a sub-four- minute mile, some few people do commit murder, and that some metal is indeed gold. \"It is simply irrational and illogical to assume that since most sightings turn out to be conventional phenomena seen under unconventional circumstances, then all must be. \"It may be appropriate to ask the question 'Aren't most people poor observers?' The answer is clearly NO.. . . since the only reason most UFO sightings can be explained is that the witness descriptions are usually quite accurate. The problem is with witness interpretation. The sceptic seems to want to play both sides of the street. He knows a particular UFO was Venus because the direction, time, angle above the horizon, and brightness as reported by the witness all match Venus. But when a witness describes a metallic-appearing disc-shaped object with a dome and alternately hovering and moving very rapidly with no noise, he must be mistaken and it was just a helicopter. \"The notion that most sightings of Unidentified Flying Objects are dimly seen under poor circumstances by incompetent observers for a very short time is both irrelevant (even if it were true) and demonstrably false on its face. \"There is no doubt in my mind after 21 years of study and investigation that the evidence is overwhelming that planet Earth is being visited by intelligently controlled vehicles whose origin is extraterrestrial. There are no acceptable arguments against flying saucer reality, only people who either haven't studied the relevant data or have a strong will not to believe that Earth is at the bottom of the heap sociologically and technologically in our local galactic neighborhood.\" After delivering his usual dynamic illustrated lecture, Stan closed by stating his personal convictions on UFOs and offered a challenge to all GRENADA UFO STAMPS AVAILABLE FROM MUFON The.world's first postage stamps hailing UFO research have been issued by the Caribbean island of Grenada. Grenada's $3 stamp has a simulated flying saucer on the left, next to a picture of a strange flash of light photographed over Bells, Texas,' in 1965. The island's 35 cent stamp pictures a radar antenna probing the skies, and six infrared spots, which could be UFOs, around the moon. Grenada's 5 cent stamp shows a woodcut reproduction of an object said to have invaded the skies of Nuremberg, Germany, on April 15, 1561. Also on the stamp is an illustration of a flying saucer as described by George Adamski. This series is titled \"UFO Research Into Unidentified Flying Objects.\" A fourth special commemorative sheet 3 by 4 inches with a 2 dollar stamp in the Center depicting the United Nations and UFOs issued October 7, 1977, is • included in this offer to Journal readers for a total of $4.00. These particular stamps have special significance to UFO enthusiasts, but have even greater importance if one is also a philatelist.

Stop being apologist ufologists! Stop being closet ufologists! Tell it like it is. Is there any better hope for our own maturation than a recognition that we all on this planet are Earthlings. There is no better way of seeing our community than from the viewpoint of our alien visitors who undoubtedly think of us as a primitive society whose major activity is tribal warfare. It takes courage to recognize our own limitations rather than to hide behind the old nationalistic, egotistic, self-serving mottos of the past. The year 2000 is approaching. Will we blow the lid off the cosmic Watergate? Will we bury the old mythlogy? The choice is ours.\" 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"UFO CONNECTION IN DULCE AND TAOS, NEW MEXICO? By Tommy Roy Blann Recently we have been hearing more and more about UFO sightings being reported in connection with animal mutilations. One such case which brought immediate reaction from the news media was the finding of a \"mysterious\" substance on some cattle in Dulce, N.M., on July 5,1978, by New Mexico State Police officer Gabe Valdez, during the height of animal mutilation activity in. the area. While unknown to Valdez at the time, another \"similar\" substance had supposedly been deposited on top of a pickup truck during a UFO sighting in Taos, N.M., three days prior to Valdez's findings. The incidents were not released to the public at this point-in-time, due to the fact that it might yield some clues as to the culprits behind the mutilations. After several months, the tests that had been conducted by Schoenfeld Clinical Labs in Albuquerque and the Los Alamos Scientific Labs were released to the news media. The Los Alamos Scientific Labs were not mentioned in the news media reports, but they did run some tests on the substances to determine the trace elements such as the rare earths, as told to me by Gabe Valdez when he visited my home in Lewisville, Tex., while on vacation. Since the news media already were intrigued by Valdez's investigations and his thoroughness in obtaining clues in these bizarre mutilations, the impact of the release of the \"semi-secret\" analysis of the two substances was more than enough to trigger an AP-wire release, which resulted in numerous misquotes from overactive imaginations of some journalists. Some, of course, were honest mistakes and a matter of semantics. One such newspaper story indicated that \"According to the Schoenfeld Research Labs in Albuquerque, N.M., this powder was identical to the substance deposited upon a pickup truck by a hovering UFO.\" This is a totally erroneous statement, since Dr. Robert Schoenfeld did not say the substance found by Gabe Valdez in Dulce was identical to the substance supposedly deposited upon a pickup truck by a hovering UFO near Taos. These same statements were unfortunately picked up from this newspaper report and published in the MUFON UFO Journal, May 1979 issue on page 18, much to Walt Andrus' regret, since the MUFON UFO Journal strives to maintain the truth on such matters associated with the UFO phenomenon. Let us now take a look at the facts, as well as some of my own findings, about this most unusual case. On the night of July 5,1978, State Police officer Gabe Valdez and Dulce, N.M., rancher Manuel Gomez had penned 120 of Gomez's cattle in a corral and moved them through a squeeze chute under a series of ultraviolet lights. Most of New Mexico's mutilations have taken place in the Dulce area and Valdez was looking for new clues, since he had been informed that certain animals might be \"marked\" before they are mutilated. His suspicion proved fruitful. The examination revealed that five of the animals had a \"glittery substance on the right side of the neck, the right ear and the right leg.\" This was too much of a coincidence, so the two removed samples of the affected hides as well as unaffected control samples from the same cattle. These were then sent to Dr. Robert Schoenfeld at the Schoenfeld Clinical Laboratories in Albuquerque. Dr. Schoenfeld said analysis of the affected hides had detected significant, \"highly suspicious\" deposits of potassium and magnesium. The potassium content was more than 70 times above normal and the substance was water-soluble and he doubts that it would have occurred on the animals through natural means. \"How it got there, I don't know,\" he said. According to the analytical findings supplied to me by Gabe Valdez, the most significant element was Potassium, then Magnesium, Calcium, Aluminum, etc., with a marked decrease in, Sodium in the sample versus the control. As mentioned previously, three days earlier on July 2, 1978, at 12:05 a.m., a very bright orange light hovered near rural homes, located 3 miles northwest of Taos, of which Valdez was not aware at the time of his findings. Mrs. Elias Vargas stated, \"I had just gone to bed and suddenly the room lit up with a bright orange light. I thought maybe the neighbors were throwing firecrackers (remember the date is'near July 4), but then I realized it was too bright to be that. I went to the window and opened it and / could hear a kind of crackling noise. The light was so bright I could see for some distance. \"At first I thought the neighbor's house was on fire, so I went to the other window. I saw this form, it wasn't a definite form, but it was roundish and about as big as two cars, maybe bigger. By then it wasn't orange anymore; it was sort of a gray color, It stayed for about two minutes. I rushed into another bedroom and opened the drapes, and it took off to the north and disappeared in two seconds. All you ' could see was a red light. It happened so fast, I got real scared; I don't think I went to sleep until five in the morning.\" The object had hovered low between her house and one close by. Both she and the people in that house, as well as the occupants of yet another in the immediate vicinity, saw the UFO just above a 500-gallon fuel tank and a pickup truck. The next morning they found a thin powder on the roof of the truck; nothing apparently was found on 14"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"HUMANOID PHYSIOLOGY By Richard C. Niemtzow, M.D. and John F. Schuessler Collecting data relating human paralysis with the UFO phenomenon, the authors have discerned that the process seems to involve large diameter nerves associated with voluntary movement of striated muscle as opposed to the impunity of small diameter nerves found in regulatory functions delegated to the autonomous nervous system. Humanoids of the 1 to l l / 2 meter type have been reported at close range to the paralyzed victims (Charles Bowen \"The Humanoids: 1977\") without being affected. This is not surprising. What remains rather intriguing is that information supplied through Project VISIT suggests that the humanoid is not composed of striated muscle, but rather smooth muscle tissue. This information is difficult to substantiate as valid scientific fact. The conjecture that humanoids are composed of smooth muscle to escape striated muscle paralysis may appear naive. Nevertheless, the humanoids are prone to a rather limited behavior pattern, somewhat expressionless, if not stereotyped, apparently less dependent on striated muscle systems. Perhaps we are dealing with a quasi- automatic intelligence, if not a cloned species. The authors have received information that these small humanoids are most likely deprived of oxygenated blood and devoid of any cellular blood composition. This also includes the lymphatic system. Furthermore, they are lacking a digestive and excretory system. Rationalization of the data is extremely difficult not have examined a humanoid, but arguments supporting and refuting these statements are numerous. If we accept that life in the universe follows many derivatives, we are not surprised that UFO literature negates these humanoids of wearing life support systems. We would expect it to be rather difficult for them to adapt directly to our Earth conditions unless adaption means privation of certain biological components which would eliminate the problem. We do not wish to manipulate by impressive arguments the certitude of humanoid physiology. We do wish to communicate that this information is comfortable to live with when UFO literature reinforces evidence that the small humanoid appears ageless, has. a barely visible mouth, may use a food pill for nourishment, lack a spacesuit, etc. We realize that this paper is highly speculative, but it represents an area that needs to be seriously addressed. We are doing just that. Each section of this summary paper is being considered in detail and we hope that future papers' may support these contentions. (New Mexico, Continued) the 500-gallon fuel tank. Dr. Schoenfeld said, \"it's possible to find all these elements in the soil, but they do not occur naturally in the air. If you say it was found on top of a pickup cab, there would have to be something to have moved it up there.\" He said it was possible the powder was a film of oxidized metal but he really didn't know. \"We're going to do some more work on it,\" he remarked. Other authorities refrained from jumping to conclusions, but clearly the possibility of a tie between the residue and the substance on the cattle fascinated them. \"Right now the only correlation is the potassium and the magnesium,\" retired scientist Howard Burgess said, \"and that's not substantial enough to say the two are definitely related. But it's intriguing.\" This particular analytical test result supplied to me on this case indicates that the most significant element was Calcium, then Sodium, Potassium, Aluminum, Iron, Phosphorus, and Magnesium in that order. Note that there is a high amount of Sodium in this sample where there is a decrease in the other sample previously mentioned. Another interesting factor in this UFO test sample is that most of the elements listed in their respective concentrations seem to suggest that it could be a combination of dust (soil- elements suggestive of this such as Potassium, Magnesium, Calcium, Sodium and the rare earths noted in the analysis), paint pigments (elements suggestive of this such as Cadmium, Zinc, Manganese, Cobalt, and Lead), and a highly oxidized metal (Iron, Aluminum, Nickel, and Chromium) from the top of the pickup truck. Potassium, for instance, is widely distributed but not easily available because most deposits of potassium compounds, in the form of feldspar rocks, are insoluble and weather slowly. Large deposits of potassium chloride, crystallized with Magnesium and Calcium compounds as complex salts, are found in Texas and New Mexico. Since these complex salts are available in the soil in Taos, one would expect to find high concentrations of these elements in such an analysis. The sample found on the cattle in Dulce is definitely not identical to the \"UFO sample\" found in Taos, although there are certain similarities such as the Potassium and Magnesium. The amount of Potassium is considerably higher in the cow-hair test sample than in the \"UFO sample.\" Also, the \"UFO sample\" found in Taos was not a powdery substance such as that found in Dulce, but chips of material about 3/8 of an inch long, 1/16 of an inch wide, and about as thick as a sheet of paper and of a dull gray coloration. Due to the abnormally high amount of Potassium found on the cow- hair test sample in relation to the control sample, it would seem that the Potassium in this case did not come from the soil. Another possibility was considered that it might have come from some type of fertilizer, since certain fertilizers are high in Potassium content, but the placement of the substance along with the fact that it was found on only five cattle out of 120 quickly diminishes this possibility. Just exactly what the substance is and how it got on the cattle is still a mystery. To my knowledge, since no one has applied the ultraviolet lights on other cattle and horses in the areas of mutilations, the incident may remain just that. 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"NEWS NOTES The Fund For UFO Research now has an official mailing address: Box 277, Mount Rainier, MD 20822. A Founding Contributor program has been established whereby anyone donating $100, $500, or $1,000 by December 31,1979, will receive a range of benefits (certificates, copies of publications, etc.). Funds will go toward start-up costs and establishing a bank balance, and the Fund is scheduled to begin accepting proposals early in 1980 for scientific UFO research projects. A new documentary film titled UFOs Are Real, produced by Group 1 Films of Hollywood, is scheduled for general theater distribution beginning in late September. According to Stanton T. Friedman, technical consultant and script co-writer, the film takes a definite stand that some UFOs are intelligently controlled extraterrestrial vehicles. Many still and motion pictures filmed all over the world are included, a number of which have never been exhibited in the United States. Persons involved in landing cases, abductions, and other close encounters are interviewed. More than 1,200 respondents to an opinion poll of research and development scientists and engineers indicated a strong belief that UFOs exist (61%). The poll was conducted by Industrial Research/ Development and reported in their July 1979 issue. Younger researchers (under 26) were more than twice as likely to hold this belief than older researchers (over 65). Among the respondents, 18% said they definitely or possibly had seen a UFO themselves. As for origin or nature, 28% said \"natural phenomena\" but 44% said \"outer space.\" The most notable changes since a similar poll by the magazine in 1971 were a 7% increase in UFO believers and a 12% increase in \"outer space\" advocates.

By John F. Schuessler Tools used in UFO investigations range from personal reference checks to lie detectors and regressive hypnosis. A major problem lies in the fact that none is foolproof. One cannot deny that each of the tools available is useful and contributes to the storehouse of knowledge we have amassed. However, every researcher would like to have the results presented in more concrete form. The March 1979 issue of Psychology Today in an article titled \"Brain Potentials: Signaling Our Inner Thoughts\" provides another option. The technique is called \"evoked potentials.\" By utilizing the advances in computer technology and in electroencephalography a large positive wave known as P300 or PS wave is monitored. This is accomplished by using an EEC machine to trace the brain's response to the stimuli and the computer to extract, via an averaging process, the response evoked by the specific stimulus from the sea of background noise that results from the brain's normal electrical activity. According to the article this process could be used to predict learning disabilities in children, diagnose senility, provide an early warning system for mental illness, and for truth tests. In the context of this Tech Note the last application is most interesting. Without denying the existence of theoretical squabbles about what evoked responses really mean, the article provides a scenario that makes the standard lie detector appear quite tame by camparison. The claim is that P300 responses could provide a truth test far superior to current lie detectors, because it does not depend upon subtle changes in the person's outward skin responses. When the person is asked an unexpected question, his P300 wave is a far more reliable index of surprise than any change in outward behavior. Even intelligence agents that are trained in the art of disguising their emotions cannot easily control their P300 response. It may be some time before this tool is available for use in the UFO investigations area, but it is good to know that limitations on our work are being lifted as technology progresses. I Mark R.

Stringfield was read to MUFON members at the 1979 Symposium: \"I am pleased to announce to all MUFON members and other responsible researchers that I have received significant new and confirmatory data relative to alien humanoids from a medical source. 'This source, who has participated in the autopsy of a recovered body, has obliged to annotate corrections in my drawings of body, head and hand I had submitted to him for appraisal. Also received was corroborative data of certain anatomical features of the external body plus other new and highly useful data. These data will be included in a paper I plan to write for the MUFON UFO Journal.\" Mr. Stringfield reported on his \"body retrieval\" research at the 1978 Symposium in Dayton, Ohio, and since then has received many new leads to information of this type from seemingly reputable persons in responsible positions.

Rubien, B.S., Woodsia Road, Saunderstown, RI 02874, telephone (401) 294-9474, will be responsible for Washington, Kent, and Newport counties in Rhode Island. The Kentucky counties of Boyd, Lawrence, and Carter will be covered by George Parsons, Jr., 1300 Mills Blvd., Ashland, KY, telephone (606) 325-2010. George is a police officer. Joan L. Jeffers, B.S., who has been very active as Director of the Pennsylvania Center for UFO Research since 1976 and a State Section Director, has been reassigned the counties of McKean, Warren, and Potter. Joan has now moved back to her permanent home at 112 Maplewood Ave., Bradford, PA 16701. Daniel H. Harris, Ph.D., 1401 E. Rundberg Lane, Lot #238, Austin, TX 78753, telephone (512) 837-9373, has volunteered to serve as a Consultant in Astronomy. Even though his doctorate is in astronomy, Dan's major emphasis in UFO research is in the area of theoretical physics. Seven new Research Specialists have joined MUFON in the past month. They are H.D. \"Mitch\" Mitchell, Foster City, Calif. (Visual Communications); James H. Ingram, Felton, Calif. (Photo- graphy); Robert Wanderer, San Francisco, Calif. (Communications); Weldon Burge, Middletown, Del. (Theology); Stores Barrett Williams, Menlo Park, Calif. (Acoustics); Raymond E. Revere, Babylon, N.Y. and Jack Guisti, Jr., Naugatuck, Conn. A paperback book (253 pages) on UFOs by Takao Ikeda, MUFON Sectional Director for Southern Japan, published in Japanese in the Tairiku UFO Series was recently received. Basically it covers the span of historical objects that could be interpreted to be UFOs up to modem cases such as Delphos, Kans., Santa Ana, Calif., etc. He acknowledges reports and photographs utilized from APRO, MUFON, and NICAP publications. Another MUFON member, who has just published a book titled \"UFO Terms,\" is Robert S. Somerville of Warren, Mich. This 197 page (8% x 11 inch) paperback book (publication date: September 1, 1979) is now available in limited numbers for $8.00, which includes postage and handling, from UFO SCHOOLS, Inc., P.O. Box 21, Warren, MI 48090. It is a comprehensive listing of UFO terms, definitions, explanations of various related phenomena, and a very good reference to cases by basic categories with samples. The 1979 MUFON UFO Symposium Proceedings are now available (226 pages, 8% by 11 inches, off-set printing) by sending a check or postal money order payable in U.S. funds for $8.00 in the U.S.A. and $9.00 in all other countries to MUFON, 103 Oldtowne Road, Seguin, TX 78155 U.S.A. (Texas residents should include 4% State Sales Tax.)"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Lucius Parish In Others'Words The May 22 issue of NATIONAL ENQUIRER tells of research into the Sanskrit writings of ancient India which contain many references to flying machines and extraterrestrial visitations. The May 29 issue reports on the ENQUIRER'S awards totalling $9,500 for the 1978 UFO cases which provided the most scientifically valuable evidence. Animal mutilations and UFOs are discussed in the June 5 issue. The June 12 issue reports on Florida contactee Lydia Stalnaker, who claims to share her body with the mind of an extraterrestrial being. In the June 19 issue, a Japanese woman credits her accurate predictions of UFO overflights to her telepathic communications with aliens. The June 12 issue of THE STAR tells of Australian TV newsman Quentin Fogarty's traumatic experiences following his involvement with the highly publicized New Zealand UFO film. Fogarty is in the process of writing a book about the incident and its aftermath. The \"UFO Update\" column in the June issue of OMNI is written by Art Gatti and deals with the UFO-related materials released by the CIA. More excerpts from the CIA data may be found in the July issue of SAGA and the August issue of UFO REPORT. Hayden Hewes' article in the July issue of FATE deals with a supposed UFO photograph which has been associated with the late George Adamski, although it was actually taken by someone else. William Spaulding's \"computer analyses\" have revealed the photo to be a hoax, according to Hewes. The Volume 2, Number 5 issue of NEW REALITIES reprints Stanton T. Friedman's contribution to the book WORLDS BEYOND, which has been reviewed in a previous column. Well worth reading. An excerpt from Allan Hendry's forthcoming book, THE UFO HANDBOOK, is found in the July issue of STARLOG. This feature deals with the proper procedures for taking UFO photographs. Hendry's book is now slated for publication by Doubleday in August. The Fall 1979 (#4) issue of UFO UPDATE has a considerable amount of rehash, along with a few new reports of interest. The #14 issue of TRUE UFOs & OUTER SPACE (as it is now called) is virtually all rehash and/or material not relating directly to UFOs. IDEAL'S UFO MAGAZINE is apparently trying to outdo OFFICIAL UFO in the nonsense department. The #7 issue contains, among other imaginative offerings, a totally ficticious account of the Valentich disappearance case from Australia. Save your money! BOOK REVIEW Interstellar Travel—Past, Present, and Future, By John W. Macvey, Stein and Day, New York, 1977, $9.95 This literate and charmingly written book is a treasure-trove for those who, like me, flunked physics. Macvey, an internationally renowned expert and writer on astronomy and astronautics, is a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and a member of the American Astronautical Society of the Pacific and the British Interplanetary Society. The owner of his own observatory, he specializes in observing variable stars. He has the marvelous ability to explain, calmly and lucidly, such timely tangles as space curvature, non-space, other dimensions and non-space tunnels in normal space. When Macvey gets through with Black Holes (both natural and artificially generated) and the destruction of time and distance, not to mention tachyon travel, you have several good notions as to how the UFOs might get here from there. How the aliens might navigate, their composition, their possible connection with the Bermuda Triangle, and evidence of past visits to Earth are covered, with many fresh ideas and some new material (new to me, at any rate). A chapter of UFOs deals with some carefully selected cases and states the writer's position: \"The writer, for his part, must confess to a time when quite arbitrarily he dismissed all UFO reports as simply due to some peculiar hysteria of the times. Now, very sincerely, he believes this to be no longer possible. Undoubtedly many reports are fakes, undoubtedly many are false, but all do not come into these categories. Something decidedly odd may be happening out there and in the lifetime of many of us the answer could be revealed.\" There is an Appendix of UFO sightings and a list of references. Macvey has also written Whispers from Space, Alone in the Universe, and Journey to Alpha Centauri. After enjoying Interstellar Travel I'm going to get the others.-Barbara Mathey"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE by Walt Andrus MUFON's Tenth Annual UFO Symposium will be remembered as the largest and finest in our first decade. The MUFON Northern California group, host for this auspicious meeting, is to be highly commended for their outstanding planning and implementa- tion to orchestrate such a detailed educational weekend of UFOlogy. Compliments have been flowing from everyone that had the privilege of attending. The tremendous success of this symposium is a tribute to the organizational structure of MUFON, whereby the leadership in a particular part of the Nation has ah opportunity to visibly demonstrate their talent and abilities. This factor not only makes MUFON the finest UFO organization, in the world today, but it gives the people managing the symposium a feeling of satisfaction for a job well done. Congratulations must be extended to Tom Gates, Chairman; Stanton Friedman, Publicity; Paul Cerny, Displays and Treasurer; and James McCampbell; all of whom spearheaded the numerous active committees. We had hoped to list the 40 to 50 people who performed so graciously, from the State Section Directors to the ladies who are MUFON members, and the many teen-agers who were identified by their badges as \"Gophers.\" This issue will feature the highlights of the symposium for our members around the world who were unable to attend. The MUFON Annual Corporate Meeting was held from 9 to 11 a.m. oh July 8th in conjunction with our tenth annual symposium with Walt Andrus and John Schuessler presiding. (1) The Annual Financial Report for the fiscal year July 1, 1978, through June 30, 1979, was presented showing receipts of $19,324.72 and expenditures of $17,071.61, leaving a net bank balance of $2,894.11. The bank balance carried forward from 6/30/78 was $641.00. Copies of the detailed financial report were given to the members of the Board of Directors present, and the remainder will receive their copies by mail. (2) Plans have been instituted to start revising and updating our Field Investigator's Manual in preparation for the third edition printing. Bruce Maccabee, Ph.D., has been invited to write the section on UFO photographs and analysis and Richard F. Haines, Ph.D., has suggested submitting a section on UFO shapes and visual interpretation. (3) Final preparations are being made for MUFON to request IRS tax exempt status in the next few months assisted by Bill Shead, one of MUFON's legal staff. (4) A rough draft of the MUFON By-Laws has been written. Since there are 15 members of the MUFON Board of Directors, it was proposed that an Executive Committee of three to five members, composed of the officers, be given the authority to make decisions for the corporation's business. The full Board of Directors would be too unwieldy for minor decisions. Each of the Board of Directors will receive preliminary copies of the By-Laws for their comments before submission to the Internal Revenue Service. (5) Bids were formally submitted for future symposiums. VISIT will host the 1980 symposium at Clear Lake City (near Houston), Texas on June 6, 7, and 8. The 1981 symposium will be hosted by MUFON of Southern California in the Los Angeles area on a date to be announced. Henry H. McKay, Regional Director for Canada, invited everyone to Toronto, Ontario, for the 1982 event. Other suggestions pending for 1982 are either Washington, D.C., or Boston, Mass.\". Following the overall plan for regions, 1982 should be in Canada or the Eastern Region. Each of the cities proposed has strong, capable host groups that could serve as the host organization. A firm bid for 1982 has been received from Toronto. We invite Washington and Boston to evaluate their plans for a future symposium. (6) Bruce Maccabee, State Director for Maryland and Consultant, discussed the formation of a grant group in the Washington, D.C., area to administer UFO grant money, receive donations, and disburse funds to researchers based upon written proposals. More details will be announced in the Journal as the plan is formalized. Three MUFON members have been elected to the board as of this date. In addition to Bruce Maccabee, they are Richard Hall and John Carlson. (7) The meeting with Alain Esterle, Ph.D., Chief of GEPAN on June 23rd in Houston was announced as a means of establishing good contacts between MUFON and GEPAN in France. (8) Paul Norman, State Representative for Victoria, Australia, and David Crockett from New Zealand were introduced. Mr. Crockett is noted for his motion picture of the UFO sequences in New Zealand on December 31, 1978. (9) Annual reports were either given orally, or submitted, by Henry H. McKay, Canadian Regional Director; Michael Sinclair, International Coordinator (written report); Mrs. Mildred Biesele, Utah State Director; Bob Neville, Nevada State Director; Gary Levine, New York State Director; Tom Benson, New Jersey; Paul C. Cerny, Northern California; Paul Norman, Victoria, Australia; Bill Hinrichsen, Continental Coordinator for South America; and John Schuessler, Texas. (10) It. was suggested that MUFON buy more films to loan to members. Members would be responsible for the payment of shipping (mailing) and insurance both ways. A new 35mm (Continued on page 18)"}]
