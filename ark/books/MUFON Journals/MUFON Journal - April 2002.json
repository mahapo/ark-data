Kentucky A recent claim of a UFO Sighting in the Maysville, KY, area appeared on the National UFO Reporting Center website, maintained by Peter Davenport. The appearance of the report was noted by Cincinnati researcher Donnie Blessing and passed along for further consideration. The report states that around 7 PM on Feb. 2,2002, a \"chevron-shaped\" object was sighted over the Ohio River near Maysville. The witness describes the object as \"pa- trolling\" between power plants on both the Ohio and Ken- tucky sides of the river. The event was reported two days later, on Feb. 4, and Davenport attached a com- ment that \"many sightings\" were also reported around the country on Feb. 2. Apparently the submission of this Maysville, KY, sight- ing to N.U.F.O.R.C. was filed anonymously, making in- vestigation of the claim all the more suspect and diffi- cult. Nevertheless, it should be stressed that anonymity is a sincere consideration among many who honestly believe they have observed something in the sky they cannot identify. So while a report submitted anonymously is more dif- ficult to follow up on, its viability as a legitimate event is not necessarily diminished. And in this instance, ano- nymity of the primary claimant served only as a tempo- rary inconvenience, as further investigation authenticated the actuality of a very unusual incident. The investigation I began inquiring into the Maysville claim by attempt- ing to identify the power stations in question, one on the Ohio side and one on the Kentucky side of the river. I first inquired with the Maysville Independent-Ledger newspaper to ascertain if their office had received any calls or published a report about such an incident. They responded by saying the had received no such calls or complaints, but were helpful with providing the names of the power stations on the Ohio and Kentucky sides of the river. On the Ohio side, two stations were located on U.S. Route 52 near Manchester. These were the Killen and Stuart power stations, both operated by the Dayton Power & Light Company. On the Kentucky side of the river, the station was identified as the East Bend Ken- tucky Power Plant. I then contacted the Mason County Sheriff's office, and the receptionist taking the call said nothing was re- ported there. She did suggest that I call the Maysville City Police Department. Evidently they dispatch \"for the county\" after 5 P.M. Calling the Maysville P.D., I talked to a very profes- sional, polite, and helpful gentleman at the department. He informed me that the Maysville newspaper had earlier called regarding this issue (in response to my previous in- quiry with them), and also said that he had no knowledge of any such reports. He suggested I talk with Victor Hamm, a Brown County, OH, resident who is a researcher of UFO sightings. As per this suggestion, a phone call was made to local researcher Victor Hamm, who had no knowledge of re- cent sightings near Maysville, and requested that he be kept informed of my findings. I then called the East Bend, KY, power station and talked with the chief security guard at the plant. When I explained the nature of my call, he asked again for the date of the occurrence and briefly stepped away to retrieve the secu- rity log books. He then returned to the phone to confirm that an unusual incident DID indeed take place at the time specified. The security chief said that the guard on duty at the security office during the time in question logged the sight- ing of an unidentified aircraft. He disclosed the guard's name to me, but it will not be released in this re- port for privacy concerns. The guard wrote the following notes in his Activity Report: \"APPROXIMATELY 1900 HOURS, 2/2/02, AN UN- KNOWN AIRCRAFT FLYING TOWARD THE POWER PLANT. IT WAS VERY CLOSE WHEN IT TURNED SOUTHWEST, FLYING AROUND THE PLANT. NOTIFIED SUPERVISOR.\" After reading the text of the Activity Report's log entry at a slow pace so that I could transcribe it word-for-word, the security supervisor informed me that the guard making this log notation also works night shift with the Maysville City Police Department and is a cogent and upright per- son. He seemed hesitant about the \"UFO\" aspect to this April 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"story and suggested that airplanes flying close to the plant are not unusual. He said that he advises his employees to log such occurrences. \"I want these guys logging any- thing that was unusual.\" After the security chief received the advisement of the unidentified aircraft by the guard, he did not under- take any follow-up activity. \"I can't elaborate on what he saw,\" the supervisor said, \"but I could almost be sure of negative results when trying to follow up on the reports, and would wear myself out calling all the airports.\" The security supervisor was leery of planes flying near the power station during this time of terrorist .concern across America, and said that a lot of private airplane pilots lack common sense. \"These cowboys flying air- planes very low. make me quite nervous; some pilots are not paying attention, or simply don't care.\" Interview with the witness Several hours after talking with the security supervisor, at the East Bend Power Station, a second call was again placed to the Maysville Police Department, this time to speak with the officer that logged the unusual sighting on Feb. 2 while he was performing guard duty at the East Bend Power Station. I was transferred to the officer's desk and advised that he was expecting my call, having been briefed by the East Bend security supervisor earlier in the evening. \"I can't tell you what it was,\" the officer said, describ- ing the object as moving slowly toward the plant. He said he was seated at the main gate with the river to his left and the power plant behind him as the silent object ap- proached. The \"unknown aircraft,\" he said, was com- prised of three multi-colored lights in a triangular forma- tion. These lights were red, green, and white. He said that, due to darkness, he could not discern structure be- hind the lighting. He did stress that the object seemed closer than usual for an airplane, and moving at a slow steady pace. He also added that while not being a good judge of heights, the object was close enough to be of some concern. \"I didn't really know what to write down,\" the Maysville police officer said, \"but we are asked to document any- thing out of the ordinary.\" When asked if he could speculate on what the object was, the officer said that it was too dark to see if the object was a helicopter or an airplane. While the officer can only say it was an unidentified aircraft, he added his 80 or 90-percent suspicion that the object must have been an airplane or helicopter of some. sort. The absence of engine noise, especially given its close proximity to his location, only seems to compound the mystery. Of additional interest, the officer said that he had not been the one to submit this sighting to the National UFO Reporting Center. He even expressed some curiosity about the N.U.F.O.R.C. report, asking what was described and the time and date of the report. Since the Maysville officer is not the one who filed the report describing the object as \"chevron^shaped,\" we obviously conclude that someone else in the area had also observed this aircraft and they, too, were unable to iden- tify it. Further inquiries The Dayton Power & Light Company's Killen Station on US Route 52 in Manchester, OH, was contacted, and the person taking the call informed me that there was no guard on duty during overnight periods. The next call was to Dayton Power & Light Company's Stuart Station, also on US Route 52, in Manchester, OH, (Brown County). While a security supervisor contacted on Wednesday morning, Feb. 27, did not have any \"Comment Sheets\" or \"Activity Logs\" referencing any unusual sighting, another officer contacted on Feb. 26 said that she was aware of numerous people at the plant who spotted \"something in the sky\" a few weeks back. She did not see the object herself, but heard about it, and the sighting had many at the plant \"talking.\"    . On Monday afternoon, March 4, an attempt was made to further inquire about the reported UFO sighting by con- tacting a reporter with the Independent ^Ledger news- paper to see if my earlier E-mail message had been re- ceived or if any new information was found. The reporter heard nothing else about this, and had no interest in following up with the report, only offering that people in Maysville are quite \"paranoid.\" I was confused by this comment and asked her what was meant by that, and she mentioned citizen concerns over terrorist events. An unwelcome ad I then asked if there would be any objection if I ran a classified ad in their newspaper in an attempt to locate anyone who may have seen this suspected UFO, and the reporter voiced no objection, and suggested I contact the classified department. After placing a call to the classi- fied department and tightening my words down to 3 lines (to keep the cost at around $24.80 for 1 week), the ad was worded and provided as follows: \"If you have seen a UFO, call 513-588-4548 or E-mail ufo@fuse:net\" The employee taking my ad (to be placed in the MIS- CELLANEOUS section) excused herself and put me on hold briefly, then came back to the phone after about a minute and said, \"Sir, I apologize, but the management has rejected your ad. We cannot run this.\" I asked if there was any reason given, and she said: \"They did not give any reason for rejecting your ad. The rejection was without comment. Have a nice day.\" Comment The East Bend Power station and the Stuart station are coal fired operations, not nuclear powered facilities. Regardless, this is a very significant event due to the re- cent terrorist events and alerts that have alarmed the na- tion. That the witnesses are collectively describing an air- craft that they cannot identify makes this report all the more interesting.

The Malleus Maleficarum, the most authoritative and influential treatise on the subject of witchcraft, was writ- ten by two erudite Dominican friars, Jacob Sprenger (1436- 95), dean of the Theology Paculty at the University of Cologne, and the prior Heinrich Kramer (1430-1505). Of all the issues dealt with in the Malleus Maleficarum, the most prominent were whether humans could feasibly procreate with demons and bear their children, and whether people were taken physically by demonic beings and trans- ported to secret locations at night-or if it was all in the mind. In other words, five hundred years ago they were debating the exact same issues as ufologists are today regarding aliens and abductees. The Malleus Maleficarum served as the official witch- hunter's handbook for nearly two centuries, the maximum authority used by inquisitors, magistrates and priests to justify the brutal torture and execution of alleged witches in every European country. The text was reprinted at least sixteen times in German, eleven times in French, twice in Italian and went through more than half a dozen editions in English, and became the principal source of inspiration for every work published after it. It is, in fact, still in print. Sprenger and Kramer studied the problem of \"demon abduction\" in a highly organized, intellectual fashion un- usual for the period. We could almost say they even crys- tallized a specific jargon for discussing such cases. Transvections Abductions were called transvections, sometimes also referred to as \"riding abroad\" or \"local movement.\" This implied the physical transportation of a person from his home to another place, either against their will or with their consent. Sexual activity was more formally termed carnal connexion, or even \"lechery.\" Imaging, as David Jacobs calls the aliens' power to alter an abductee's perception of reality to create realistic illusions, was known as glamour to medieval inquisitors. Many concepts popular five hundred years ago were identical to those in use amongst modern researchers: float- ing, sperm collection, spontaneous lactation, screen memo- ries, multi-generational encounters, and scars and marks on the body. Inquisitors even had to watch out for tiny \"magical\" items which the suspected witch could be con- cealing under her skin, reminding us of abductee implants. Mental Abductions Medieval demonologists, similar to today's abductionists, could be divided into two broad groups: the sceptics and the \"true believers.\" The sceptics regarded the whole subject of transvection as a mental illusion that gave a person the sensation of being lifted bodily by dev- ils and taken through the sky. There was no need or pre- cedent for complex.psychological theories, as such illu- sions were generally attrib- uted to dark Satanic forces. In fact, it was he- retical to think otherwise. A growing number of researchers have specu- lated on the possibility that some, if not all, abductions and encounters occur in altered states of con- sciousness and not in the physical world as we know it. The first indication of this arose, oddly enough, from a conversation be- tween alleged contactee George Adamski and ufologist Ray Stanford. In 1958 Adamski reportedly told Stanford that he really \"did not ever have to go out into space to know about the spaceships...All I did was project my consciousness to the beings out there and I could see them and know what was in their ships.\" 1 If true, this is certainly a case of non-physical contact with UFOs. However, it does seem that what Adamski was referring to was the willful projection of his astral body, not an abduction per se. David Jacobs has asserted that \"abductees are never physically in place when they have an abduction experi- ence,\" and that researchers have never found a single instance of it. In direct opposition to Jacobs' statement that abductees are never present during their experiences, John E. Mack writes that \"just as often, it seems, a per- son has not gone anywhere while they were experienc- ing an abduction.\" 2 John Spencer has published another possible case of genuine \"mental abduction\" which occurred to Finnish doctor Rauni-Leena Luukanen-Kilde, acting director of the Finnish Department of Health and Social Security. Despite physical symptoms and scars relating to her ab- duction, \"she believes that her physical body remained in bed throughout the whole experience and that it was her astral body which boarded the spacecraft.\" 3 The late Dr. Karla Turner spoke of this kind of expe- rience in her book Taken: Inside the Alien-Human Ab- April 2002 MUFON UFO Journal PageS"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"duction Agenda. 4 She called them VRS or Virtual Real- ity Scenarios. Katharina Wilson's excellent analysis of the technological aspects of the abduction phenomenon, Project Open Mind, speculated on the same theme, adding that \"we must understand that regardless of whether the ab- duction is physical or mental, the abductee (or mind con- trol victim) still experiences the physical and emotional trauma related to it.\" 5 Therefore, when we read in the Malleus Maleficarum that \"some witches are transported only in the imagina- tion, but that it is also found in the writings of the Doctors that many have been bodily transported,\" we cannot help but recall the theories of late twentieth-century abductionists. Medieval Abductees Lest the reader conclude prematurely that only witches were thought to be transported by demons, it should be noted that the inquisitors were aware that very often men who are not witches are unwillingly transported bodily over great distances of land. 6 Sprenger and Kramer mention several examples of people they know to have been carried away by devils. \"One of us,\" they write, \"has very often seen and known such men.\" In Chapter III of Part II they relate the story of the young son of a nobleman who went missing one night and was found the next day inside a locked mill. Another scholar, who later became a priest in the dio- cese of Freising, \"used to say that at one time he had been bodily carried through the air by a devil, and taken to the most remote parts.\" The authors affirm that both angels and devils have lifted up humans at different times in his- tory, beginning with the prophet Habacuc in Judea (Daniel xiv, 32-38:32). Anyone, from the most pious of citizens to the most evil sorcerers, could be transvected. \"For if He [i.e., God] per- mits it in the case of the just and innocent, and of other Magicians, how should He not in the case of those who are totally dedicated to the devil?...And for this reason it is concluded that those who by night are carried in their sleep over high buildings are riot carried by their own souls, nor by the influence of the stars, but by some mightier power...\" 7 There was no rule about the time of day or night an abduction could take place, and the victim \"could be con- scious or unconscious. And indeed it must be confessed that such things can happen not only to those who are awake, but also to men who are asleep; namely, they can be bodily transported through the air while they are fast asleep.\" 8 The vehicles of witches Like fairies, demons could abduct a person simply by entering a building and floating them out. In a Discourse upon Devils and Spirits, added as an appendix to Scot's The Discovery Of Witchcraft (1665 edition) we read that \"many such have been taken away by the said spirits, for a fortnight or month together, being carried with them in chariots through the air, over hills and dales, rocks and precipices, till at last they have been found lying in some meadow or mountain, bereaved of their senses.\" Sprenger and Kramer arrive at the following conclu- sions regarding the nature and beginning of a transvection: *' that the experience is often physical, but \"virtual\" trans vectons sometimes happen; * that the act may be carried out either visibly or invisibly; * that there doesn't seem to be any way to predict who the main targets are or when they are going to oc- cur; * and that people are frequently abducted unwillingly, even from their bedrooms, and are not always returned to the spot from whence they are taken. The Physical Nature of Devils Although it was not regarded an urgent issue, there was always a great deal of speculation among witch- hunters about the physical appearance of demons and devils. No consensus existed about what they looked like, though this is easily explained. First of all, we must bear in mind that-theoretically- only witches actually saw devils in their \"true\" form, when they were transported to secret gatherings with them. The inquisitors rarely got to see any supernatural phe- nomena themselves and could only base their theories on hearsay and popular superstitions. Secondly, it was acknowledged that devils could change their physical appearance whenever it suited them, and would adopt the form of a man or a beast at will. For an inquisitor or demonologist, therefore, the situ- ation was rather like that which ufologists face when it comes to classifying entity types. There are patterns in the data, but far too many patterns for ufologists to utilize in their search for a global hypothesis to explain the phe- nomena. The third reason for so much confusion-and the most important one from a theological point of view-was that demonic entities were not believed to possess fixed physi- cal forms at all, but that they were creatures composed almost entirely of air. The reasoning behind this was that all animate organic bodies without exception must be re- garded as living entities. Yet all \"life\" must proceed from the soul. As devils do not possess souls, they logically cannot be made up of organic matter. And what is not com- posed of physical particles has to be made of air! There- fore, to argue about the exterior appearance of what had no interior organism made no sense, and the question was not judged an important issue. Nevertheless, devils were usually thought to adopt three kinds of disguise: goblin-like, human, and animal (includ- ing fantastic animals). Sprenger and Kramer add little that is new, concluding only that \"no shape is beyond their power; thus they can move [their assumed bodies] as they wish, in such circumstances as they will.\" Devils cannot be attacked with normal weapons. This is known because \"when any have tried to cut or pierce with a sword the body assumed by a devil, they have not been able to; for the divided parts of the air at once join together again.\" Although UFO entities do not seem to have this useful ability, some UFOs have been observed Page 6 MUFON UFO Journal April 2002"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"to do just this. In an article entitled Ufitorco, el Cerro del Contacto, by Lorenzo Fernandez Bueno and Iker Jimenez, published in the November 1999 edition of Enig- mas, we find the case of a professional mountain climber who encountered a strange sphere in the UFO-infested province of Cordoba, Argentina. He shot at the object as it hovered in the air in front of him. The shots' split the sphere into eight or ten smaller spheres, which, in complete silence, joined back together on their own. Terrified, the climber fled back down the mountain with the sensation that he had stumbled into terrain that did not belong to human beings. How Devils Communicate According to the Malleus Maleficarum, demonic be- ings \"have no lungs or tongue, though they can show the latter, as well as teeth and lips, artificially made according to the condition of their body; therefore they cannot truly and properly speak.\" Abductionists today claim that aliens lack the organs necessary for speech production, although creatures with normal mouths complete with teeth have been witnessed by some abductees. Demonologists had some difficulty in explaining how demons communicated with the witness. The Malleus Maleficarum tries to explain the process in the following way: \"When they wish to express their meaning, then, by some disturbance of the air included in their assumed body, not of air breathed in and out as in the case of men, they produce, not voices, but sounds which have some like- ness to voices, and send them articulately through the outside air to the ears of the hearer. And that the likeness of a voice can be made without the respiration of air is clear from the case of other animals which do not breathe, but are said to make a sound, as do also certain other instruments, as Aristotle says in de Anima.\" Of course, in 1486 telepathy was unheard of, but it would have solved many of the logistical problems faced by the two Dominican friars! David Jacobs has a better time explaining the dilemma: \"The aliens' slitlike mouth does not have lips...Abductees do not see teeth, a tongue, or saliva. The aliens do not use their mouths for communication... In virtually all abduc- tion accounts, the communication between the aliens and the abductees is done through \"telepathy,\" and not aurally through their ears. Words are not sent through the air in the form of aspirated sound waves formed by lungs ex- pelling air through a set of vibrating chords.\" 9 Breathing Do demons breathe? Do aliens breathe? To paraphrase Sprenger and Kramer, no, they do not breathe, because they have no lungs with which to inhale, and no biological need for our air. And to quote Jacobs once again, \"Abductees do not report seeing an expansion and con- traction of the chest as if the aliens were inhaling and exhaling air [which] leads to the possibility that the Be- ings do not breathe air, at least not in the manner that we are aware of, and do not interact with the atmosphere as we do.\" 10 Eating and Drinking Eating is another biological process unknown to de- mons. \"And we may say as to eating,\" write Sprenger and Kramer, \"that in the complete act of eating there are four processes. Mastication in the mouth, swallowing into the stomach, digestion in the stomach, and fourthly, me- tabolism of the necessary nutrient and ejection of what is superfluous.\" The authors reach the conclusion that although the first of these may be achieved by angels and devils (and they justify this by referring to the fact that Jesus Christ him- self reportedly ate food, though nobody would say that his body really needed it to survive or that he ever went to the bathroom as mortals do), the last two parts of the eating process are purely for living beings of the Earth. \"Do aliens eat or drink?\" asks Jacobs. \"The evidence seems to suggest that they do not...the ingestion of 'food' might be very different, if it exists at all.\"\" Sprenger and Kramer agree with Jacobs, but go one step further by proposing a novel theory. Devils, they sug- gest, \"instead of digesting and ejecting...have another power by which the food is suddenly dissolved in the sur- rounding matter.\" In Jacobs' second book, The Threat, it seems he is catching up on the two friars when he suggests that nutri- ents are \"absorbed\" by aliens through the skin. 12 This is about as close to \"dissolving matter\" as one can get with- out saying exactly the same thing. Of course, the difference between the theory ex- pounded in the Malleus Maleficarum and Jacobs' own idea-one based on an analysis of abduction reports-is that demons were not believed to \"need\" food, and \"dis- solved\" it just for show. The bottom line, however, is that a leading abduction researcher has reached very similar conclusions to those of leading Medieval demonologists based on the same fragmented \"evidence\" and specula- tion. Mind Control The Malleus Maleficarum makes it clear that demons could use their powers of telepathy and illusion to cause April 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"people to see, think, and feel things that were not real. This is identical to the ability which aliens are said to show during abduction episodes. Demons, like aliens, could use their powers to disguise themselves as animals or other terrestrial beings. The history of demonic encounters? Kramer and Sprenger write that little is known of the prehistory of sexual contact between humans and devils. Taking the date 1400 BC as an example, they acknowl- edge that it is \"unknown whether they [i.e., witches] were addicted to these filthy practices as modern witches have been since that time; for so far as we know history tells us nothing on the subject.\" 13 Ironically, David Jacobs' opinion on this subject seems to echo those of his inquisitorial predecessors when he says, \"It is possible that aliens have been abducting people for hundreds of years, but we have found no evidence of it.\" 14 The difference is that the authors of the witch-hunt- ing manual conceive of a long history of transvections and encounters with the entities, but Jacobs does not.

Researchers move step closer to photonic microchip By Janet Wong March 18, 2002 — Researchers at the University of Toronto have figured put a way to \"nudge\" nature into making photonic crystals in a specific order and pattern, a critical first step in the development of photonic circuits and microchips. Photonic crystals allow scientists to control the flow of light. Light can carry much more information than cur- rent electronic switches and Internet routers, says Pro- fessor Ted Sargent of the electrical and computer engi- neering department. But light is difficult to control. While scientists have been successful in creating a stable photonic crystal, they have not been able to control its placement and degree of order and configuration on the surface of materials up until now, a crucial factor when it comes to building things like circuitry. \"The photonic integrated circuit is the holy grail of the optical communications industry,\" Sargent says. \"Our work with these crystals established one of the first steps nec- essary to one day creating a photonic microchip.\" The team's research involved growing colloidal crys- tals—also known as artificial opals-on textured surfaces. This process allowed them to precisely control the place- ment and ordering of the crystals into desired patterns. Sargent conducted the research with U of T chemistry professor Eugenia Kumacheva and two graduate students. Their work appeared in the Feb. 15 issue of Advanced Materials. Sargent likens their process to that of an orchestra's conductor who does not play all the instruments or notes, but rather sets the rhythm and placement. \"Nature is still doing all the work in creating photonic crystals; we're just politely asking it to do it in a particular location with a defined order and configuration.\" MUFON shirts and caps Wear official MUFON T-shirts (royal blue print- ing on white cotton), sizes S, M, L & XL.

Burleson, Ph.D. MUFON SD, New Mexico investigators over .the years have, produced an impressive body of witness testimony painting a remark- ably clear and consistent picture of the now famous Roswell crash debris. People who were present in 1947 and fortunate enough to see, and in some cases touch, the debris, have described (among other things) thin pieces of foil resistant to being broken or burned. Now a new witness has turned up to add some detail to this ever growing narrative. He is unwilling to be iden- tified, and I will refer to him by the fictitious name of Philip Croft.   .,-',.: My wife, Mollie Burleson, herself a MUFON member, .first met Mr. Croft quite by chance and conducted a pre- liminary interview with him. Subsequently I have con- ducted two follow-up interviews, and the account that has unfolded appears to be highly significant. Mr. Croft spoke freely and comfortably to us of his experience, but understandably insisted on remaining anonymous. In 1951 Croft lived in Corona, NM, and was employed by the Highway Department, working on roads around Vaughn, Corona, and Carrizozo. He and his friends used to go deer hunting on land near Corona. One day in No- vember of 1951 one of his two hunting companions was Mack Brazel, whom he and a friend had met at the bar in Corona. This was of course the W. W. Mack Brazel well known to UFO researchers as the ranch foreman who came into Roswell on Sunday, July 6, 1947, with a box of strange debris to show Sheriff George Wilcox and got himself taken by the military for his troubles. Mr. Croft's account adds some intriguing new facets to our understanding of Brazel's involvement in the Roswell incident. On the day in question, the hunting party was out in the prairie southeast of Corona near the spot where Brazel had parked his truck. Brazel suddenly seemed a bit ner- vous for some reason. He looked toward his truck and said, \"I want to show you boys something.\" Going to the truck arid opening the door, he pulled an odd object out from behind the seat. Philip Croft has described the object as a piece of \"sil- ver-aluminum\" metallic foil, \"paper thin,\" and about the size and shape of a dinner plate. Unfortunately he didn't get to touch the material himself, but he had plenty of opportunity to observe it, because Brazel set the object up at.the base of a pinyon tree and suggested that they fire at it-which they did-with 30.06 deer rifles from a distance of about thirty feet, an easy target for experi- enced deer hunters. Mr. Croft said that when the foil was hit, it spun a considerable distance up in the air and came floating down \"like Kleenex.\" Upon examining the material, the men found that it showed no effects from having been hit-not even a dent, and certainly no tears or punctures. Keep in mind that the material, which resembled tin- foil, was paper-thin and light enough to float down through the air. I'm not a hunter, but two weapons experts have assured me that a shot from a 30.06 from a lot further away than thirty feet will easily penetrate a car door, and the weapon will of course drop a deer from more than a hundred yards away. Yet these shots left the strange piece of foil unscratched. (This suggests that rumors of full-scale ballistics tests done in secret on the Roswell material-tests that left it unaf- fected-may well be true.) It is clear from this account that in spite of all official efforts to the contrary, and in spite of his son Bill Brazel's having had his own scraps of debris confiscated in 1949, Mack Brazel must have managed to keep an illicit piece of debris from the Roswell UFO crash. As described, the material that Croft observed in 1951 could in no way have originated on this planet, though Mr. Croft himself drew no particular conclusions about its origins. In fact he asked Brazel at the time, \"Didn't the army people tell you what the stuff is?\" Brazel, in characteris- tically colorful fashion, replied, \"No, and they're sure be- ing a bunch of chicken****s about it.\" Clearly he was still upset over the whole business, feeling put-upon by his experiences with the military, and feeling anxious that the wrong people not know of his possession of the material. When Croft asked Brazel exactly where he had found the foil, Brazel said, \"I got it where they vacuumed the ground.\" He went on to say that the military brought heavy equipment out to the spot (which we now call the debris field) and literally vacuumed a five-hundred-foot radius of land so clear that there was almost not a weed or a rock remaining. (This account corroborates other witness descriptions of the army's cleanup.) Brazel said that what little he was able to see of the army's activities^ he had to watch from a distance, as he was not allowed close up. \"They'd threaten your life,\" he said, according to Croft's memory of the conversa- tion.    .-.-,•. I< asked Mr. Croft what happened to the metal foil af- ter they had shot at it, and he said that Brazel simply put it back in his truck. Needless to say, one has to wonder what ever happened to this piece of material from an- other world. At any rate, thanks to witness Philip Croft, we now know more about the aftermath of the Roswell incident. Mr. Croft told me that on the few occasions over the years when he mentioned this experience to acquaintan- ces, they only laughed at him. As a UFO investigator I assured him that I, for one, am certainly not inclined to laugh. Obviously what he saw was not readily explain- able in any mundane terms. When I asked him if I might use his real name, he said, \"No, I think all this stuff is still real sensitive.\" And how right he is.

Lie'ser (Continued from last month) Background from March issue: Thomas Bullard has identified a dilemma facing the occupants of the highest national offices in 1952 in terms of what to tell the public about known or seriously suspected ET visitation: \"If the government knew of an alien presence and kept it secret, the eventual revelation would draw down a storm of public criticism; if the government did not know the aliens were coming, the citizens would berate it for in- competence or dereliction of duty.\" If we add a third horn to this dilemma in the form of at least a minimal direct threat to the national security posed by the aliens-a prospect that strategic thinking could not rule out in the summer of 1952- Bullard's statements are even more relevant. The well-known September, 1947, letter from Gen. Nathan Twining, then head of the Air Materiel Command at Wright Field and acting Air Force Chief of Staff in mid-195 2, to the commanding general of the Army Air Force disclosed a concurring opinion among AMC tech- nical and engineering facilities that \"the phenomenon re- ported is something real\" and further noted \"several re- ports of well kept formation flights varying from three to nine objects.\" The aggregations of UFOs viewed on radar by per- sonnel at the Washington National Airport during the July, 1952, overflights at times comprised transitory clusters, if not formations. The Twining conclusion should have been available not only to Air Force officials but to the Presi- dent, who was briefed on a quarterly basis, beginning in 1948. The various safety nets conceptualized here provided their beneficiaries with a defense against accusations of failing to anticipate a worst-case scenario, perhaps taking the form of a stifling encroachment on some or many aspects of 1950s civilization-and against ensuing charges of betrayal of the public trust for not dealing openly with the possibility. On whose shoulders would the responsibil- ity come to rest? A series of safety nets Following is the continuation of the annotated table,of safety nets discussed last month in the Journal, each of which protected a top official or agency. For each ex- ample or episode the name of the safeguarded entity is shown, followed by 1) a brief description of the triggering event or impetus for the net; 2) the nature of the vulner- ability necessitating a net; 3) the character of the net; and 4) the approximate date of its deployment.

Each President felt he had to \"cover himself in case the UFO situation got out of hand. porting the claims offered and to highlight areas where further research might prove valuable. PRESIDENT-ELECT EISENHOWER: the Scien- tific Advisory Panel of Jan. 14-17, 1953, as a safety net. 1) Dee no doubt became aware-possibly through Walter Smith-of the course being pursued by the Air Force in making classified UFO information available to the public through Donald Keyhoe and thus deploying its own safety net. This was evidenced by Keyhoe's article in the De- cember issue of TRUE, which should have hit the news- stands in late November, 1952. 2) As incoming President, Dee was about to be thrust into a situation in which some top Air Force officials in the Pentagon and some ATIC officers concluded that the disks were real. Even though the specter of a direct threat seemed to be vanishing, based on the rapid decline in the number of UFO reports month by-month after July/Au- gust, Dee, unlike his soon-to-depart predecessor, faced at least four years of bearing the ultimate responsibility for whatever response to the phenomenon might be required. 3)A documented negative scientific' verdict as to ET causation would provide a counterweight to the Air Force and to Keyhoe's article and would also lend assurance that Dee would not be blindsided on the eve of his Jan. 20 inauguration. 4)Late November, 1952-January, 1953. COMMENTS: A) Following Eisenhower's November election victory, Walter Smith was motivated by a dual allegiance: still loyal to his current boss, yet honoring anew with abiding admi- ration the general whom he had served as chief of staff during World War 2. Truman paid tribute to Smith's loy- alty, recalling with tears in his eyes Smith's request for Page 10 MUFON UFO Journal April 2002"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"permission to sound out Ike for a job in the coming admin- istration. Smith, though not a West Point graduate, coveted the highest military calling, the chairmanship of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Sometime, most likely early in December, he was disabused of this aspiration; however, in part out of loyalty to Ike, he accepted an offer of the lesser position of assistant secretary of state under John Foster Dulles. On Nov. 21 Smith made his first post-election visit to the President-in-waiting aboard Eisenhower's train. Dur- ing what was primarily a social visit, Smith provided a briefing on developments in Korea. \"On 28 November Smith ... went up to the President-elect's headquarters in the Commodore Hotel in New York. Smith was alone with Eisenhower for about an hour. During that time the President-elect asked him to initiate action on several mat- ters. One of them was a reappraisal of 'cold war activi- ties.'\" 7 Once he received Chadwell's Dec. 2 memo announc- ing the latter's intention of forming a panel of scientists to consider the UFO problem, Smith apparently hurried the start of the proceedings. \"The CIA men ... tried to post- pone the Panel meetings to give Battelle time Ito com- plete its landmark statistical study of UFOs], but were overruled by their own Director of the CIA ...\" 8 Was Smith pushing a pre-inauguration deadline and a negative verdict from the panel in order to protect the new Presi- dent? B) In his Dec.. 2 memo to DCI Smith, Chadwell recapitulated unavailing efforts of the past months to bring on board another investigative team from the ranks of the government; he reminded the DCI that UFOs still fre- quented the skies near major defense installations, and again urged him to follow through on his Aug. 20 commit- ment by calling upon the National Security Council; and finally he announced (no doubt encouraged by ATIC sup- port at a Nov. 25 briefing) that he was taking it upon himself to organize a scientific panel. Smith's reaction to this challenge was typically swift, an indication that he had anticipated and prepared for Chadwell's move. Instead of consulting with his OSI head, however, he followed the recommendation of another as- sistant director, James Reber (AD for Intelligence Coor- dination), who in October had suggested that before go- ing to the NSC, the DCI should turn to the Intelligence Advisory Committee (IAC) for its input. The decision to draw in the IAC, which was composed of intelligence representatives from the military branches, State Depart- ment, AEC, FBI, and Joint Chiefs, signified Smith's sur- render to the defense establishment. Nominally subordinate to the DCI, the IAC military reps had throughout the lAC's history ignored this statu- torily mandated chain of command and attempted to im- pose their authority over the nation's chief intelligence officer. As recently as August these had emerged the victors in a jurisdictional dispute in which the scientific OSI was forced to cede several of its defining scientific intelligence functions to the military. This \"had a devas- tating effect upon the morale of the OSI.\" 9 In the Dec. 4 hearing arranged by the DCI, attended by I AC reps and OSI officers, and presided over by CIA's Acting Deputy Director for Intelligence Robert Amory (Chadwell's immediate superior), the IAC made two rec- ommendations strongly intended to guide the OSI in con- ducting the scientific panel's proceedings: 1) \"the prob- lem is best approached if directly related to problems of intelligence and defense,\" and 2) consideration of a pro- posed NSCID would \"... depend in some measure on the results achieved by the scientists' studies.\" Both of these cut the ground from under Chadwell, who wanted the panel not to pronounce a terminal ver- dict, but only to indicate the fields of science that should be explored in a deeper investigation; nor did he want specific prob- lems of intelligence and defense to be addressed until the resolution of the nature of the UFOs could point the way to their so- lution. Smith seems to have raised no objection to the IAC attempt to steer the proceedings of the panel. C) Although the Rob- ertson Panel was convened by the CIA, some evidence' indicates that preparations for the forthcoming sessions might have served the purpose, even if unintentionally, of making the panelists aware that the incoming President would be exposed to allegations that he was heedless of a looming threat presented by the UFOs. Thornton Page and Luis Alvarez were two panelists who understood that the panel was called by the new President. Notices con- firming the arrangements (time and place) that must have been sent to the panelists could have revealed a presiden- tial interest. Any scientists randomly selected would as a group no doubt have reflected a strong bias against UFO reality; the smaller the panel, of course, the easier it would have been to influence its direction. Three of the five panelists, Robertson, Page, and Alvarez were honestly selected, even if they were not screened for what was their soon to be revealed anti-UFO bias. Less is known about Berkner, who was probably called upon to fill in when other candidates declined to serve. We are tempted to cast a suspicious glance at the choice of the embarrassingly anti-UFO physicist, Samuel Goudsmit, who was likely under the sponsorship of Berkner. Goudsmit and Berkner were both affiliated with Brookhaven National Laboratories, Berkner as a mem- ber of its board of directors and Goudsmit as the recently appointed (1952) chairman of its physics department. If, as we might assume, Berkner was on familiar enough terms with his BNL associate to know of his egregious bias and yet encouraged him to participate, both men should have been disqualified from serving. Berkner missed the consensus-building sessions of the panel, including the definitive film viewings and subse- April 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"quent discussions, possibly because his presence as Goudsmit's director would have inhibited the physicist from expressing his opinions. With Berkner's absence a quar- tet of the scientists cast much in the same mold held forth. Berkner's assertive personality, strong military back- ground, and failure to pursue a Ph.D. set him apart. As a high-achieving non-West Pointer, Gen. Smith might have regarded the under-credentialed Berkner as a kindred spirit-which is not to say that there is evidence of collu- sion between the two to pack the scientific jury. D) At the three-hour afternoon session of the Robertson Panel on Friday, Jan. 16, the scientists reached general conclusions and discussed tentative recommendations for inclusion in their report. It was agreed that chairman Robertson should overnight draft a report of the panel to Chad well. Perhaps it was coincidental that Berkner only made his appearance on the panel when the draft report was to be formulated, then restructured. Unfortunately, no copy exists of Robertson's draft (in public records at least), and the only clue we have to its content depends on a controversial passage from Ruppelt's book, in which he purports to quote the opening paragraph as follows: \"We as a group do not believe that it is impossible for some other celestial body to be inhab- ited by intelligent creatures. Nor is it impossible that these creatures could have reached such a state of develop- ment that they could visit the earth. However, there is nothing in all of the so-called 'flying saucer' reports that we have read that would indicate that this is taking place.\" 10 Since this paragraph appears nowhere in the final re- port, some have concluded that it was concocted on the basis of rumors. However, Ruppelt's friend, CIA officer Walter Durant, was also the compiler of the Report of Meetings of Scientific Advisory Panel on Unidenti- fied Flying Objects ... It was agreed by the panel that Durant (an associate panel member) would incorporate materials that \"were felt inappropriate for inclusion in the final report\" in this internal report. The following excerpt from the internal report seems to precisely restate Ruppelt's quotation:\"... none of the members of the panel were loath to accept that this earth might be visited by extra-terrestrial beings of some sort, some day. What they did not find was any evidence that related the objects sighted to space travelers.\"\" If we conclude that Durant passed the quotation on to Ruppelt, it seems obvious why the anti-ET verdict would have originally been placed front and center and not deemphasized as it was by the obfuscating language of the final report. It must have been assumed by the panel and recognized by Robertson that what the new Presi- dent was most concerned about was this very question of ET presence. Early the next morning, before the proceedings resumed, Chadwell was in possession of a copy of the draft, which he showed first to Samford and undoubtedly later reported on to Smith. If there were any need, Ike would soon have been informed of the gist of the unambiguous first para- graph. The three hours spent by the panel on discussion and revision of the draft on Saturday resulted in a report high- lighting cold war problems, as recommended by the IAC, even though these had never been the burning issue for Chadwell. E) The prospect of a negative verdict by the panel that would sweep under the rug worries about presidential culpability in the public's eyes also offered the chance to improve (restore?) harmony within the intelligence com- munity. Ike had in mind a replacement, or rather, two re- placements for Gen. Smith as DCI. The then current deputy director (DDCI), Allen Dulles, would move up to the top post, while the new DDCI would be a surprise entry: Lt. Gen. C.P. Cabell, a consultant to CIA in 1952, but better known as the head of Air Force Intelligence from late 1948 until late 1951. The importance the new President attached to his se- lection of Cabell can be seen in the swiftness with which he acted (the Dulles and Cabell choices were announced together only a week after the panel's verdict), and in the requirement that the Senate Armed Services Committee had to approve a bill to bypass the restriction prohibiting a member of the military from becoming DDCI. Dulles told the committee in a cryptic remark that his agency \"must have 'very close' relations with military intelligence groups.\" 12 Perhaps Ike, in his choice of Cabell, admittedly a skill- ful administrator, was farsightedly anticipating Air Force-CIA collaboration in programs such as LJ-2, OXCART, and CORONA; and Dulles, characteristically immersed in covert action projects, was by nature ill-suited to direct the total agency. More pointedly, it seems likely that with Cabell as de facto administrator, any attempt by Chadwell or other CIA officers to undertake UFO-related actions compromising the Air Force investigation would hit a stone wall. What had begun as Truman's cribis was fast winding down, with closure becoming the order of the day. Only the Air Force, still at a hypervigilant pitch, would find rea- son to once again fear the consequences of inaction. THE AIR FORCE HIGH COMMAND (again): affirming the alien presence through the O'Dell paper. 1) Soon after Feb. 17, 1953, Al Chop called Keyhoe into his office to inform him of a spurt in UFO sightings. The 42 military reports alone in the first 17 days of Febru- ary, said Chop, denoted a trend, which if it continued, could lead to \"the July trouble all over again.\" 2) The Air Force faced the possibility that the highly questionable Robertson Panel verdict, delivered a month earlier, would be rendered moot by a renewed, even more intense UFO wave fraught with harrowing potential. Ex- emplifying the proverb, \"once bitten, twice shy,\" the Air Force was loath to assume the role of scapegoat to which Truman's July actions had consigned it. 3) Expressing the hope that Keyhoe would be able to secure publication of an explicit warning of the alien pres- ence, the Air Force, through Chop, loaned him the so-called O'Dell paper. Ostensibly written by Air Force officer Col. William C. O'Dell, the paper bore the title: \"Planet Earth- Host to Extraterrestrial Life.\" As a dramatic extension of Page 12 MUFON UFO Journal April 2002"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Donald Keyhoe the disclosure program, the paper reflected the Air Force's acute apprehension. 4) Approximately Feb. 20,1953. COMMENTS: A) The action of releasing the O'Dell paper to Keyhoe was aptly described by him as \"throwing caution to the winds,\" since those who authorized its release were bent on increasing the level of alien awareness among the pub- lic, even at the risk of creat- ing a heightened anxiety. In what respects did the paper qualify as an expression of official policy? If it was not official policy, why were no papers released that offered contending opinions? The handing over of the paper was not treated casu- ally; it was released, accord- ing to Chop, only after ap- proval by the Air Force Se- curity and Review Board. Garnering the Board's ap- proval of course, would have posed no problem for Air Force higher headquarters. If, as Keyhoe supposed, the paper was written in 1952 and had been released immediately, many would have recog- nized it as a reply to the widely read, high-impact LIFE article of April 7, whose title asked the question, \"Have We Visitors from Outer Space?\" The paper also represented a resurrection and reitera- tion of the conclusions of Project Sign's 1948 \"estimate of the situation,\" rejected then by Air Chief of Staff Vandenberg, but now dusted off and sensationalized for mass consumption. As has been the case with other not-for-attribution policy releases, some restrictions were imposed to seem- ingly mask the paper's origin; yet it is questionable as to how seriously these were to be taken. Chop described the paper as \"one man's opinion,\" even though the au- thorship was perhaps corporate. O'Dell's standing as a colonel in Air Force Intelligence was not for publication. Still, the deniability was transparent-perhaps intentionally so-and Keyhoe could, and obviously did, reveal the source later. B) So far as can be determined, no copy of the O'Dell paper exists, except what might be in government files. With only the title, the greater part of one sentence, and Keyhoe's general impressions made available to us, can we uncover the thinking of the author(s)? Foremost in its lineage is the H.G. Wells novel, The War of the Worlds (1898) from which O'Dell drew the concept of an alien race forced to abandon its no longer habitable planet and seek in earth the site for a colony, or at least a new fund of natural resources. Unlike the Wells novel and its pared-down 1938 Mercury Theatre radio version, there is no hint of a violent occupation, and the image of the aliens that seems to emerge is one of displaced superin- telligent parasites. When Keyhoe showed the paper to TRUE magazine's assistant editor, it was rejected 6n the grounds that \"With- out O'Dell's rank, we'd be accused of printing a scare story by some wild-eyed author ... clearing this O'Dell story baffles me, and it could have been a slip-up.\" 13 Af- ter reporter friends echoed this verdict, Keyhoe returned the paper to Chop. How should O'Dell's presentation be labeled? Bear- ing a title that mimicked a headline, it resembled a news- paper science feature (being several typed pages in length), although it lacked any science to support the the claim made by its title, and apparently made no cogent argu- ments defending the ET possibility. Given the dramatic title, the paper can be considered at the least a declara- tion or startling announcement. Beyond this obvious intention, it seems evident that the paper was to perform the function of a tutorial. The bulk of the paper, judging from Keyhoe's summary of it, con- sisted of generalizations on space travel and astronomy suitable for the briefing of an unsophisticated lay audi- ence, a group that could be expected to recoil from the title with a disbelief founded in part on unfamiliarity with basic cosmography. Foreshadowing publications such as the recent Cometa report, O'Dell asked the reader to assume the perspective of an outgoing space mission from Earth, driven perhaps by terrestrial exigencies to study a less advanced planet in preparation for contact or exploi- tation. CONCLUSION: Along with the hypothesis of the primacy of cold war necessity, the safety net paradigm provides a framework in which to comprehend the reactions of responsible highly-placed officials to the macabre reports of fantastic aerial activity over Washington, D.C., in the summer of 1952. Jaws must have dropped in the ranks of ufologists and historians on the recent discovery that President Truman had assigned DCI Walter \"Beetle\" Smith and his CIA to tackle the UFO problem. Although Gen. Landry has stated that the CIA option had been kept open since 1947, the level of national secu- rity concern forcing the President's hand must have been great, so severely did his action inescapably intrude and reflect upon the Air Force's conduct of its five-year mis- sion. The reverberation was felt throughout those govern- ment precincts having a vested interest in the potential fallout from public response to an unnerving UFO-related incident. Impacted first was the DCI; however, almost immediately repercussions were felt by the Air Force, which, lacking its own scapegoat, was unable to shake the monkey of accountability off its back. Once the monthly rate of UFO reports fell into the twenties in April, 1953 (and it had been low at the time the Robertson Panel was convened), carrying with it a presumably much diminished threat, the Air Force began to reverse its back-door policy of openness verging on affirmation of ET causation. \"As the 1950s and 1960s wore on, the actual words of the Robertson Panel Report (e.g. no evidence of any di- rect threat to national security, remove the aura of mys- tery surrounding UFOs) regularly appeared in press re- April 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":".leases, briefings, and policy statements.\" 14 In spite of the report's classified status for many years, the panel, be- cause of the regular use of its pronouncements, repre- sented a halfway step toward civilian accountability. When later the National Academy of Sciences endorsed E.U. Condon's largely personal assessment of the results of the University of Colorado study (based more than a little on his fixation on the nutcase factor and, as Air Force contractor, on his dutiful subservience to the Air Force and its need to shed its UFO assignment) it implicitly ac- knowledged the transfer to the civilian scientific commu- nity of responsibility for overseeing public concern over the ongoing manifestations of the unpredictable phenom- enon.

'To see something which nobody else has seen before is thrilling and deeply satisfying,\" says Wolfgang Ketterle, a physicist at MIT and one of the first scientists to create a new kind of matter called Bose- Einstein condensates. \"Those are the moments when you want to be a scientist,\" . Bose-Einstein condensates (\"BECs\" for short) aren't like the solids, liquids and gases that we learned about in school. They are not vaporous, not hard, not fluid. Indeed, there are no ordinary words to describe them because they come from another world-the world of quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics describes the bizarre rules of light and matter on atomic scales. In that realm, matter can be in two places at once; objects behave as both particles and waves (a strange duality described by Schrodinger's wave equation); and nothing is certain: the quantum world runs on probability. Although quantum rules are counter-intuitive, they un- derlie the macroscopic reality we experience day-to-day. Bose-Einstein condensates are curious objects that bridge the gap between those two realms. They obey the laws of the small, even as they intrude on the big. A BEC is a group of a few million atoms that merge to make a single matter-wave about a millimeter or so across. In 1995, Ketterle created BECs in his lab by cooling, a gas made of sodium atoms to a few hundred billionths of a degree above absolute zero-more than a million times cooler than interstellar space! At such low temperatures the atoms become more like waves than particles. Held together by laser beams and magnetic traps, the atoms overlapped and formed a single giant (by atomic standards) matter wave. Says Ketterle: \"Pictures of BECs can be regarded as photographs of wave functions\"-that is, solutions to Schrodinger's equation. Working independently in 1995, Eric Cornell (National Institute of Standards & Technology) and Carl Wieman (University of Colorado) also created BECs; theirs were made of super-cold rubidium atoms. Cornell and Wieman shared the 2001 Nobel Prize with Ketterle \"for the achievement of Bose-Einstein condensation in dilute gases of alkali atoms, and for early fundamental studies of the properties of the condensates.\" Bose-Einstein condensates were predicted by Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert Einstein in the 1920's when quantum mechanics was still new. Einstein wondered if BECs were too strange to be real, even though he himself had thought of them. Now we know Bose-Einstein condensates are real. And Einstein was right: they are strange.

Apparently the part of the July 24,2000, video show- ing the woman riding in the helicopter pointing back to- ward the twin towers of the World Trade Center was accepted as authentic because every frame coincided in sequence, advancing action of the previous one as ex- pected. The UFO toward which she points and its sudden ac- celeration out of sight is called into question because- though \"the background video appears real\"-the deter- mination is made \"with the UFO presumably pasted in.\" \"The UFO moves every other frame This is conclusive evidence that the UFO was edited into, the video by a lazy faker who didn't bother working on every field as re- quired for a real video.\" [According to Sainio.] Jeff Sainio is obviously not aware of the technological UFO research done by Dr. Harley Rutledge, head of the Physics Department of the University of Missouri South- east at Cape Girardeau. As president of the statewide society of physicists, he was funded by the St. Louis Post Dispatch to purchase high-tech equipment essential to his study with no bias attached to the series of reports he was to file for the newspaper's publication. Many readers were surprised at his eventual conclusions that UFOs are real and seem to present us with evidence of technologies exceeding then current human potential. In a 1974 lecture given by Dr. Rutledge at the First Unitarian Church of St. Louis, he cited several anomalies recorded in UFO flight, such as changing flight paths or the disappearance of objects as soon as camera focus had been achieved! He invested a few minutes to tell about 16 mm motion picture film shot-if I recall correctly- at 24 frames per second \"which showed the UFO only on alternate frames.\"    ; Dr. Rutledge attempted no explanation for the phe- nomenon; but since he had controlled the procedure from the loading through the filming to the development and screening, he had no reason to question the authenticity of the evidence. I-as a minister and no scientist-might suggest that a millipulsed electromagnetic system (effectually giving the vehicle an isolated antigravitational field) moved it visibly into our dimension only as rhythmically pulsed. Quantum physics seems to allow for those potentially blank alter- nate frames. Maybe your readers can mull over the mystery from the perspective of their individual knowledge and personal hypothesis. One thing we can agree on: the evidence was not faked by Dr. Rutledge, and may have been just as real in the July 24,2000, video. -Rev. John E. Schroeder, Past-president of the UFO Study Group of Greater St. Louis, Inc. Sainio replies Rev. Schroeder compares this video, in which the UFO MOVES every other image, with a film case in which the UFO APPEARS in every other image. The situa- tions are fundamentally different. In any case involving apparently high quality evidence, the researcher must use Occam's razor; is the simplest explanation fraud or reality? Even ignoring Rutledge's testimony that he properly controlled the chain of evi- dence, faking a film in which a UFO appears every other frame is a huge amount of work. It involves repeatedly adding a model, shooting a single frame, removing it, taking another frame, adding the model again in the correct position, repeating ad nauseum. Fak- ing this characteristic is much more work than a straight film. (Computer alteration in 1974 is unlikely.) In contrast, digitally faking a video involves editing each unique image. The fewer unique images, the less work. Although video contains 60 unique images per second, other Sci-Fi promos I analysed for comparison contained only 24 or even 15 unique images per second. (The re- mainder were simply repeats of the previous image, in- serted by default by the editing software.) This is adequate for the casual viewer, and is cheaper. The UFO was edited-in at only 30 images per second in the last dozen in which it appeared, consistent with fak- ery. While the alternating characteristic of Rutledge's case involves much more work, the alternating charac- teristic of this video involves no extra work at all. Sci-Fi's VP of Alternative Programming has admitted the video is a fake. -Jeff Sainio The Return of Valentich? Dear Editor, In the January 2002 issue, Scott Corrales (\"Human- like Ufonauts Reported in Many Countries\") mentioned the case of a young man claiming to be Frederick Valentich being reported in the Canary Island, and displaying an Australian passport as proof. Much as I hate to spoil a good story, I must point out that Valentich disappeared while flying between two parts of Australia, thousands of miles from any foreign shore. It can be safely assumed that he did not have his passport with him that fateful night. Furthermore, any passport valid in 1978 would have expired by 1990, and it certainly wouldn't contain any visa for Portuguese terretories. Indeed, the witnesses must have been extraordinarily naive not to ask such obvious questions. -Malcolm Smith April 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Filer's Files By George A.

Bill says, \"As I was stopped at the light, I saw the object once again, and it was moving very slow to the south and was much lower this time, so I watched it cross the sky, turn right, and circle back toward me. \"The craft was moving very slowly until it passed in front of me, then it made a sudden burst of speed before making .the circle back. It looked very light in the air, like it was playing around in the sky. I turned right and stopped the car to watch in absolute amazement. As the craft passed by again it was even lower. It flew over the office buildings and the lights from the parking lots and buildings allowed me to see this thing clearly. \"It was a black flying triangle craft, with three big, white lights, one on eaclvcorner, and a red /orange flash- ing light in the center. The most amazing part of the sight- ing came when the triangle craft tilted on its side to reveal the underside. I was shooting photo after photo. I shot 15 in all.

Two or three side by side lights did not appear to be moving. \"As we got off the Interstate, heading south- west on 76, we saw that the lights were ahead of us, over the Dutch Fork Elementary School,\" says the witness. \"As we passed to the southeast of the lights, I was looking almost straight up at them and saw they were three white lights in an equilateral triangular formation, with a red flashing light in the middle. I had not seen the red light until I was looking up at the object from under- neath. The lights began moving slowly southeast towards Columbia. \"The red center light was blinking once every second or two, but not constantly. It would appear to stop for a feyv seconds and then start. The object flew below the horizon towards the southeast at a couple thousand feet up, but the pattern of lights seemed too big for a helicop- ter.

Thanks to ewarrior@electricwarrior.com : United Kingdom flying triangle tracked Southern England — A Flying Triangle was tracked across England on March 3, 2002. UFO investigator David Kingston received reports of a bizarre triangular craft with red and blue lights, zooming across the skies from Cornwall to Poole. The mystery machine was first spotted in St. Austell. There were also reports of it not far from Lyme Regis later the same day, then over Portland and Poole. Mr. Kingston, who first witnessed unexplained flying objects while serving with an RAF intelligence unit during nuclear tests in the Pacific, is at a loss to explain the latest sightings. He says: \"I received a number of consistent reports of a craft flying over the West country on Feb. 15 and there is nothing like it in the world aircraft guide. It was said to be triangular, 100 feet long, with red lights all the way up on the right hand side, and blue lights on the left hand side. \"Underneath was what appeared to be a very large light in the middle, glowing pale electric blue through to purple with a corona surrounding it. Four or five people witnessed it and described it as gliding silently at about 2,500 feet. It was described as hovering quietly at Port- land. The last sighting was near Poole, about two hours after the first.\" Kingston first heard aircrew talk of seeing UFOs dur- ing the nuclear tests on Christmas Island in 1957, and has catalogued.hundreds of reports and witnessed many strange sights himself.

Oldest known UFO photo purchased : At the end of the E-bay online auction of March 4, 2002, Independent-International Pictures Corp. president Samuel M. Sherman announced that his company had won at auction the oldest known UFO photograph. After several days of feverish bidding, Sherman won the photo for his company in the last 50 seconds of the auction with a final high bid of $385. The photograph is a winter 1870 stereo (3-D) view of clouds over Mount Washington in New Hampshire. Plainly and sharply visible in the photo is a long cigar-like object. Since this is before known manned flight, with the exception of balloons, which this is not, the object will have to be ruled as a solid Unidentified Flying Object. Structure to this solid object is clearly and sharply seen in some detail, as is the reflection of the sun off the ob- ject. The stereo view presents two images (for right and left eye) which will be helpful in further analysis of it. Sherman reported that due to the sharpness of the image it will lend itself to further enlargement for study. Sherman also stated that this photograph will not be locked up in some collection, but will be submitted to sci- entists for detailed analysis, and the results made avail- able to the public, which he says wants answers to the UFO mystery. Sherman states that the debunkers are al- ready circling around the photo on the internet, even though they have only been able to see poor low resolution com- puter images and not photographic enlargements of the actual photo. He expects this photo to be very controver- sial for a long time still to come. Sherman and Independent-International Pictures Corp. have already produced the Edwards Air Force Base En- counter, a one-hour audio documentary of the UFO alert at Edwards Air Force Base in 1965 (www.edwardsufo.com). Since 1992, a feature film docudrama has been in research and production. It is called, \"Beyond This Earth,\" and concerns extraterres- trial visitation of Planet Earth. Filming for this movie has taken place internationally, as well as the acquisition of UFO footage from locations all over the world. The most amazing part of this project was the 1993 expedition which sent up a plane with photographic, mo- tion picture and video equipment to successfully pursue and image UFOs over Northern California. Sherman stated that the 1870 UFO photograph will have a place in the docudrama and further projects to be released to the public: Thanks to Sam Sherman North Carolina oldie but goodie Rodriguez Gil writes, \"I wanted to share a sighting told to me by my grandmother, who passed away in 1991.\" She had this sighting when she was about fourteen years old in 1920. She, her mother, and other family and friends while picking cotton in the fall when they saw something large that in her words 'looked like two pie pans placed together lip to lip, zig zag across the sky and come to rest in the field' in front of them where they were working. \"She said 'two little bald white men' got out and pointed short sticks at them. They were 'the size of little boys, but their faces seemed older.' One of the little bald men began digging and poking in the dirt with something like a shovel, and put some dirt into a bag. He then took a small plant and put that in a bag also. \"All the while the other little man kept his stick pointed at them. Both little men then backed up one after the other and entered this pie pan-shaped thing, still pointing the sticks at them as they walked backwards. She said 'it presently lifted off and zig zagged back in the direction it came.' She said, that they all thought it had something to do with the government. \"She mentioned that the small men looked the size of 8 to 10 year old children, and that the UFO was bigger than an automobile. They talked about it for little while and then went back to work. It seemed to have impressed her as something very strange, but she said that they had to get back to work in order to make their days wages 'working from sunrise to sunset.\" Thanks to Gil. grodriguez@windelsmarx.com. Florida engine stop case CLERMONT — The 26-year-old college graduate was traveling down Lake Louisa Road towards Lake Shore Drive oh Feb. 2,2002, when he noticed a bright light down by the lake at 2:53 AM. The bright light was like a truck's high beams or a spotlight shining directly at him. The ob- ject was just above water level down in the valley. The witness states, \"When I started to pass from its view, the light started to approach up the hill and made a slow move across the road above my car. It flew directly over my car, just in front of my hood at 15 to 20 feet in the air. At this point my '99 Ford Mustang completely died on me! The battery and all. I couldn't get the engine to turn or anything. \"I was sitting right below this thing, and it was dead silent. I had the window about a 1/4 of the way down, and I could hear nothing. It was probably the eeriest silence I can ever remember. The bright light sat there for about 30 seconds and finally started moving off to my right. It took some time for my eyes to adjust and stop seeing spots. It rose out of view and darted off as though it was shot off like a slingshot at a 45-degree angle. \"I was able to start my car after a minute. I believe in rational explanations to events like these, but this really scared me. My car is working perfectly, and I have never had any problems with it before or since. It couldn't have been a helicopter because the light was at a low level and there was dead silence.\" MUFON MUGS Official MUFON ceramic mugs with blue logo, $8.00, plus $3.50 S&H. MUFON, P.O.

Page 18 MUFON UFO Journal April 2002"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"View from Britain By Jenny Randies Testing UFO: a web site proposal There has been much talk recently about ho\\v 10 gel science more interested in the study of UFOs, and the bottom line seems to be that science responds best to those who play the grime by its own rules of evidence. Scientists like to ^e theories being tested against evi- dence and Research, and experiments set up and con- ducted to either confirm or deny that theory. They de- nounce us for not trying, when in fact UFOIogy actually does quite a lot of this, but the data is scattered far and wide and difficult for even the widely read to reign together. That is half the problem. In a world where so many re- searchers are involved in the study of UFOs, and their in- volvement occurs for a wide range of motives, and their publications of evidence ap- pear in countless sources, then just how does one follow what is taking place? Keeping track I would suggest that maybe there is an opportunity to be- gin an active data base of theo- ries and research. The best for- mat for its operation would be through a web site that is policed by some person or group (basically just to elimi- nate the time wasters and practical jokers). Otherwise it should be open to anyone to post relevant information into an agreed format through the site's gatekeeper. Here is what I have in mind. Firstly, the site should exist for one purpose only: as an ongoing noticeboard for UFO theories and research. The idea being for any UFOlogist, regardless of his or her beliefs or allegience to groups, to be free to post onto here with any research that they are conducting-or any research proposal that they believe someone ought to conduct-in order to help test a specific theory. We might call this by the acronym TESTING UFO-(this meaning Theories, Experiments, Suggested Trials & information gathering). Testing UFO Step one in the project is to create the Testing UFO web site to an agreed format with all the major groups offering to endorse and promote it. Will they do this, you may ask. But if they decline, we can legitimately ask why they would not, since how will it damage any organiza- tion to participate? So, let them shame themselves by opting out if they choose! We might even (like the UN or European Union) ro- Jenny Randies tate the site gatekeeper between major groups, with each one taking on the role and the cost of administration for, say, a one-year period before passing on the baton to an- other. This would make Testing UFO a truly cooperative venture that serves the purpose of everyone, and one that is not unduly burdensome on any single group or indi- vidual lo keep it smoothly operating. But that is just a suggestion. Once the format is agreed and the site designed, then ils purpose should be simultaneously announced by all participating groups and promoted through open UFO lists on the net-then being immediately in operation so as to allow all UFOIogists to post onto it as often as they wish. Here is what I suggest that theTesling UFO site could contain. Initially, a set of pages listing an agreed theory of UFO explanation. We could probably define the first 20 or so of these up front, ranging from the obvious ones, such as \"UFOs are advanced craft of alien origin,\" or \"UFOs are time travellers,\" and on to more skeptically-minded possibilities, such as \"Misperceptions of mundane events\" to \"Fantasy Prone Personality side effects,\" and so on. There should be opportunity for people to suggest new theories and add these to the set of options, provided that the suggestion is sensible. But there really should be few resinclions on possible theories to be awarded a set of pages because the whole idea is to allow the site to ex- plore every serious research option, and that only works if freedom of theorizing is allowed. For each theory that the site contains, there should be a set of \"blank Pages\" on the site, with no space restric- tions on any of them-allowing anyone to post as much as they wish onto the pages relevant to each theory. A short introductory paragraph could explain each theory-simply defining its terms-but this should not be more than a few lines long and may not even need to be more than a one-line definition of the theory. Within the blank pages devoted by the site to each theory there should be two sets of sub pages to which people can post (via the gatekeeper). Firstly, pages to which people can contribute ideas that they may have to test that particular theory. For instance, someone might post to the 'Time Travellers\" theory pages the following: \"In order to test the theory that UFOs are time travel vehicles visiting from our future, we might suppose that there could be a link between interesting historical events and the levels of visitation. If so, then there should be evidence of a correlation between reported sighting num- bers and the geographical and temporal occurrence of major historical events that might attract visitors from the future.\" Many ideas must occur to all researchers from time to April 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"time about the way to test a particular UFO theory. I am sure there are hundreds of them floating around now amongst those of you reading this column 1 Testing UFO will offer the noticeboard to post that iugyesiion (before you forget about it) and make it visible lor others to read in the anticipation that someone might then pick up the idea and conduct an experiment built around it-even if you do not have the time or the inclination to do so. If the UFO community actively uses the Testing UFO site to post suggestions as they emerge-for instance be- cause of the results of a case that they are engaged in investigating or through something they have just read in a book or on the net that sparks their thinking-then these pages should provide a visible source of the flow of ideas to which any UFOlogist can turn from time to time to gain inspiration. The second set of sub pages within each UFO theory on the Testing UFO site should be devoted to posting work in progress or summaries of completed projects. Any re- searcher who is sparked into doing an experiment to test- one way or the other-a particular one of the theories on the site should post his or her intentions with a brief out- line of planned protocol onto the relevant pages. They can then update this with added notes about progress whenever they choose. Equally, any researcher who has already conducted an experiment that seems to offer evidence, one way or the other, towards establishing or disestablishing one of the theories on the site should post to those pages a brief summary of what he or she did and what u as found out, with references directing to a published source \\vhere the full data can be viewed. In essence that is all there is to this idea. Possibilities: Testing UFO is a simple idea, but if used properly it can prove an invaluable source for thousands of people. It requires a dedicated gatekeeper to receive incoming posts, properly assign them to the correct pages on the site, and to do so fairly often so as to keep the site lively. But the outcome, if the UFO community embraces this venture and uses it as it is intended, is full of possibili- ties. The site will be the first truly pan UFOlogical ven- ture that shuns any barriers imposed by nationality, group allegiance, skeptic or believer, witness or researcher-genu- inely open to all-and it utilizes the power of the internet in a very positive way. Who knows what kind of ideas, research, and experi- mental studies it will inspire, and at a minimum it should help orientate UFOlogists towards thinking more scien- tifically. That alone makes the project worthwhile. Plus, of course, once Testing UFO is up and running and hopefully proving itself as a posting board for all on- going major projects, it will allow everybody to keep track of who is doing what in order to try to prove which par- ticular theory. That alone will be invaluable to UFOlogy. But moreover they can then seek to duplicate or extend this existing research and through the site give all of UFOlogy the opportunity to follow the state of play in terms of scientific research into all the major theories. How can we lose? We all surely gain something here. Page 20 In my opinion the existence alone of a successfully oper- ating Testing UFO site that is fulfilling the objectives set out above will be enough to interest some scientists and make others at least indisputably aware that UFOlogy is not a field filled with crackpots, but an active, interactive, and objective community aware of the way to gather sci- entific data. Any scientist that rejects UFOlogy in the light of this will have some explaining to do! The only problem I can envisage is whether we are up to this challenge. But if we are not, then what are we here for? MUFON Georgia investigates strange light in bedroom By Tom Sheets MUFON SD Georgia The witness is a 20-year veteran law enforcement of- ficer, male, working for a major metro Atlanta area agency, who is known to me. He reported that several months ago he was reassigned lo the Day Watch from night duty. He had placed a cover over the bedroom window to keep out the light when he was sleeping in the daytime. He had not bothered to remove this after changing watches, so it was still in place when this event occurred. The witness was almost asleep, with his elderly cat sleeping on the foot of the bed. Witness heard the cat \"growl,\" something she never does. Witness rolled over to see what was wrong and immediately observed an extremely white rectangular light hovering over the bed about four feet above. He indicated that the light was about the size of a shoe box lid, and, while being VERY white in color, did not give off any light that illuminated the room. He added mat it resembled a white \"window.\" The witness sat up and tried to touch it and found that it moved away, but kept the same approximate four-foot distance. He then watched it for a few minutes, then turned on the night light, which caused the white rectangular light to vanish. The officer then got up and went downstairs and dis- cussed it with his wife for a few minutes, then decided to again turn in. After returning to bed, the white rectangu- lar light once again appeared. Witness sat up and tried to touch it, and on this occasion was successful. He stuck a finger into it and found no sensation of heat, adding that his finger went right through it, and illustrated that it had no depth, only width and height. The witness then revolved his hand around the float- ing rectangular light in an effort to see if it was possibly light leaking in from some other source, but this was ruled out; the room was completely dark. When he put his hand up to touch it again it seemed to shatter into what seemed like a million small specks and disappeared. Witness added that he felt no threat or harmful intent, but it was perplexing because it seemed lo be a bright white \"hole\" hanging in the air over the bed. The officer added that he was not taking any medications and was not ill at the timet. He said that he was familiar with an- other officer who had experienced a similar event.

Here, for example are a number of reasons for aliens to travel to Earth. Please note that I am assuming that travelers come from within our local neighborhood, since there are 46 sun-like stars within only 54 light years of the sun that might be expected to have planets and life. One pair, Zeta 1 and Zeta 2 Reticuli, in the southern sky constellation of Reticulum, are less than one light year apart, about 37 light years from here, and are about a billion years older than the sun. They have had ample time to develop technology much more advanced than ours. I do not assume that the small craft often observed near the ground just came here from Zeta Reticuli 1 or 2, but that these were carried here by a huge mother ship, as seen in a number of excellent cases. So visiting aliens might be: 1. Graduate students doing thesis research on the de- velopment of a primitive society on the huge variety of langiuues here, the huge variety ot genetic stocks, etc. 2 Broadcasters with a weeklv ihow ''idiocy in the boondocks. 3. Mining engineers. Since the Earth is the densest planet in the solar system, it has more relatively rare, very dense elements with very special properties-such as ura- nium, platinum, osmium, rhenium, gold, tungsten-than any other planet in the solar system. 4. Checking on this planet to which they banned bad guys and girls'ages ago. It was the Devils Island of the neighborhood, and that is why we are so nasty to each other. 5. Potential observers of expected natural catastro- phes, such as nuclear war, a collision with a large orbiting body, asteroid etc. 6. Running special jaunts to this honeymoon capital of this corner of the galaxy. 7. Guides for hunting and fishing expeditions seeking the weird wildlife specimens cavorting about. No license required. 8. Specimen gatherers for ET zoos. 9. Gatherers of genetic material for hybridization, since we have a huge variety of almost all biological and bo- tanical materials, including humans. Other older places may have long ago run out of many varieties. 10. Jailers of miscreants who are being punished by having to spend two weeks near earth. Punishment to last a lifetime. 11. Advance men for the establishment of amusement parks. The land for Disneyworld in Florida was bought up secretly in advance. • 13. Proprietors of supply centers for travelers needing water, food, or various hydrogen isotopes for their fusion or other propulsion systems. Sort of like the English coal- ing stations on islands in the oceans in the last century. Or gas, food, lodging next exit, perhaps on the side of the moon away from the earth. 14. Anthropologists checking on colonies left here mil- lennia ago, perhaps as part of a competition for who can do the best job. 15. Flyers doing their cross L'aloxy flying solos. 16.Training missions for sp.Kf explorers, anthropolo- gists, marines, navigators. 17. Repairmen for space communication systems, checking out the \"new sources\" of electromagnetic waves fouling up their communications. 18.Antique and curio buyers from elsewhere gather- ing specimens and souvenirs. 19. Advance men for space missionaries like those who converted the natives in Africa. 20. Talent recruiters for non-earthling sports teams. We on average seem to be larger, and stronger than our visitors. 21. Relativistic space travelers returning home after a short (pilot time) journey. 22. Advance men planning an interstellar competition on neutral ground, such as Iceland was for the Fisher Spaasky chess match. 23. Rescuers of arms caches left behind eons ago for use in warfare. 24. Intragalactic advance men for the next Olympics or for new hotels and resorts. I am sure readers can come up with their own top-ten list. My preferred reason for alien visitations is to quaran- April 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"tine us to make sure we don't take our brand of friend- ship-usually described as hostility-out there. This notion in based on one assumption I make about every advanced civilization, namely that it is concerned with its own survival and security. This means that it must keep tabs on the primitives in the neighborhood, but only close tabs on those able to bother that civilization. At the end of WW 2, it was perfectly clear to any visiting alien spy checking out the place that soon this primitive society, whose major activity is tribal warfare (we Earthlings killed more than 50 million of our own kind and destroyed 1700 cities during WW 2), would be mov- ing out and bothering the neighbors. Soon would mean roughly one hundred years, which is obviously nothing on a cosmic time scale. The three indicators of rapid devel- opment of interstellar flight capability were nuclear weap- ons, powerful V-2 Rockets, and powerful radar and other electronic devices. As it happens, the only location on the entire planet at which one could study all 3 in July, 1947, was Southeast- ern New Mexico. The first atom bomb was tested at Trin- ity site on White Sands Missile Range in July, 1945. White Sands was where the captured German V-2 rockets were being launched, and is also where the best radar was to track the rockets. The recovery of a crashed saucer near Roswell-and another in the Plains of San Augustin-should not be surprising at all. I would further note that because the time to go from one's first flight technology to space travel is so short, that during any one century it is very unlikely that there are other solar systems in the neighborhood going through this transition at the same time. They are either way ahead of us or way beyond us.We would be a natural focus for visitation.

May 2002 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): The parade of all 5 naked-eye planets continues its visibility until about mid-May. Beginning with dim Mer- cury nearest the WNW horizon at dusk, the remainder of the planet lineup, in order, is Saturn, Mars, and Venus (all 4 in Taurus), and off by itself, Jupiter. Mercury reaches its farthest point from the Sun on the 3rd. Dazzling Venus (magnitude -4.0) lies quite near Sat- urn (0.1) and Mars (1.7). Venus is nearest Mars on May 10. On the 14th the crescent Moon joins the planetary trio-a pleasing sight. (On this date the Moon covers all 3 planets elsewhere in the world.) Meanwhile, Jupiter (-2.0), in Gemini, stands highest of the group in the western sky. Approximate midmonth setting times: Saturn, 9:30 PM; Mars, 10:15; Venus, 10:30; Jupiter, 11:45. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): There are no bright planets visible this month, Penumbral Moon Eclipse: On Sunday morning of May 26 the full moon penetrates the faint outer part (penumbra) of the Earth's shadow, shading slightly the lower hemisphere of our satellite. Except for the northeastern U.S., early risers in the cen- tral and western states will see parts of this rather un- spectacular penumbra! eclipse before the Moon sets. The entire event is visible from Hawaii. Maximum eclipse (71.5% of the lunar diameter covered) occurs at 7:03 AM CDT, 6:03 MDT, 5:03 PDT, and 2:03 HST. Moon Phases: Last quarter—May 4 New moon—May 12 First quarter—May 19 Full moon—May 26 The Stars: After the long spring twilight ends, Leo the Lion can be found to have already crossed the N-S meridian, while kite-shaped Bootes the Herdsman approaches the merid- ian from the E. The latter constellation's dominant star is orange-tinted Arcturus, 2nd brightest star (after Sinus) in the Northern Hemisphere night sky. Below Arcturus lies bluish-white Spica in Y-shaped Virgo the Maiden. The 3rd brightest luminary visible from these latitudes is Vega, well up in the NE sky.
