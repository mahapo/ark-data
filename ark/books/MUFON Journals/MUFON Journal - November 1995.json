This article was originally published in the Ohio UFO Notebook #9, a publication of MidOhip Research Associates, Box 162,5837 Karric Square Drive, Dublin, Ohio 43817. Reprint permission was granted by the editors, W. E. Jones, J. D., and Irena Scott, Ph. D. Mr. Jones is MUFON's State Director for Ohio; Ms. Scott is MUFON's Director of Publications and co-editor of the annual MUFON Symposium Proceedings. T he General Accounting Office (GAO) investiga- tion initiated on behalf of U.S. Representative Steven Schiff, R-NM, has filtered into the ranks of the Federal government, in particular that part under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense, an orga- nization that many UFO investigators believe has cus- tody of at least part of the documentation concerning the flying saucer crash that allegedly occurred near Roswell, New Mexico in July of 1947. In the Summer of 1994 we had the good fortune of meeting with one of the proba- bly dozens of DOD employees who had been given the task of going through the records of their respective organizations to determine if any documentation con- cerning the Roswell event could be located. This par- ticular employee works for the National Air Intelligence Center (NAIC) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. NAIC is the predecessor of the Air Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC), later renamed the Foreign Technology Division (FTD), which conducted the Air Force's very own UFO research project named Project Blue Book until the project was closed in 1969. The employee is named Bruce Ashcroft and he is the Center's historian. Because of this position, he was given the task of combing through the Centers files and records for any evidence that the Center was maintain- ing anything concerning the Roswell event. We think it would be safe to say that Bruce is, first and foremost, a historian. Because of this, he has ap- proached this task with enthusiasm. He has also devel- oped a personal interest in the Roswell story and has spent some of his own time and funds collecting and an- alyzing information on the story from outside sources. As part of his personal efforts, he has talked with many people, including Stanton Friedman, Robert Todd, Philip Klass and Karl Pflock. At the same time, it must be said, he has kept his work for his employer and his per- sonal pursuit of the story entirely separate. As a result of his research, he has reached the con- clusion that it is likely a prosaic explanation can account for the Roswell story if the information and evidence can be located. As a historian, he recognizes that evidence disappears and might never be located. While expecting a prosaic explanation, Bruce admits that the reports of alien like bodies do present a problem for this point of view, so he is keeping an open mind. If the material taken from the debris field was ex- traterrestrial in source and represented material that was beyond then state-of-the-art technology, later U.S. Government sponsored materials research should have been affected by the knowledge that was gained from the Roswell material. The Government would have tried to replicate the material that was found. Bruce studied reports from the \"hottest\" materials research projects un- dertaken by the Air Force during the 1947-1951 time pe- riod and could find no evidence of new directions in re- search which might have resulted from the Roswell ma- terial as it has been described in the UFO literature. He pointed out that one explanation for the dearth of material on Roswell in the Government's files might be that the event was not deemed all that important by the people who were involved with it. Documents could have long since been discarded. He found no reports on the Roswell event, nor references to it in any of the files he searched, which included those of his own or- ganization, those at the Air Force library and archives at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama, and at the military records center in St. Louis. As a result, he looked for secondary type records such as reports on expenditures, possible related project reports, and facility reports. He found nothing that related back to the event in those records either. Bruce observed that if alien bodies had been found at Roswell, they would most likely have been taken to the Aeromedical Research Laboratory at Wright- Patterson. He hopes that this source will be looked into by the GAO investigators. We asked Bruce about the rumored tunnels at Wright- Patterson. He replied that he only knew of tunnels used to go from one building to another during inclement weather. He reminded us that a Dayton, Ohio TV re- porter by the name of Carl Day had earlier investigated reports of such tunnels. Building 739, pictured on page 30 of the July 1993 issue of the Ohio UFO Notebook, re- portedly has a vaulted steel door with a combination lock. It is sited on a concrete pad and has its own venti- lation shaft. The building is rumored to be an entrance to NOVEMBER 1995 NUMBER 331 PAGE 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL He looked for secondary type records such as reports on expenditures, possible re- lated project reports, and facility reports. He found nothing that related back to the event in those records either. underground chambers. Day reported that investigators did not locate a rumored tunnel between it and the Avionics Laboratory. Bruce added that engineering maps he had seen of the base do not show tunnels, so he really can't add to what is known, nor detract from what is ru- mored, about the infamous tunnels. In the same issue of the Ohio UFO Notebook, page 22, we reported on several apparently original pho- tographs that were shown to us by an informant which were reportedly used on the TV show \"UFO Cover-Up Live.\" One of the photographs had an identifying num- ber which read \"FTD-SYD, Veh Type WHDDD4.\" We asked Bruce if this was an identification numbering system that he was familiar with. He replied that he was not familiar with that type system. As noted above, the reports of alien-like bodies found as a result of the Roswell event are something that he cannot adequately explain, at least at this time. He has not talked to anyone during his investigation who re- ported direct knowledge of the bodies. Someone would have to have been on Mars for the past 25 plus years not to have at least heard about the Roswell crash, given the media coverage it has received. However, if the bodies are real, the matter would most likely be considered security information, so that doesn't surprise him one way or another. Bruce noted that he had once lived in Texas, and New Mexico and knew some of the people mentioned in the Randle and Schmitt book, The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell. He recently returned there and, after visiting both UFO museums in Roswell and talking with some of the named witnesses, he has seen no convincing evidence that a craft and bodies were ever retrieved in 1947. Inquiring about the history of Project Blue Book, we asked Bruce to identify the building Project Blue Book had been located in. He replied that Project Sign, the ear- lier UFO study, had been located in Building 287 and lat- er moved to Building 263, possibly in 1953. It was later moved to Building 858 and then 275. All of these build- ings except Building 858 have since been torn down. B ruce is concerned that some may think that because he works for the federal government he has been paid to distort information or present disinformation on the Roswell story. He views himself as sincere and would be personally bothered to think that others feel differently. He is doing the best job that he is capable of doing to respond to the request that came down through the chain of command from Rep. Schiff through the Secretary of the Air Force. Because of the work he has done, he has developed a personal interest in the case which will go on after his professional assignment is completed. No one in the Center has attempted to dis- courage this personal interest. He emphasized that any efforts of his regarding the Roswell case in the future will be undertaken on his own time. One of the things which drives Bruce \"crazy\" he says is FOIA requests. While he realizes that the FOIA process is a useful way for obtaining information, he thinks in the case of the Roswell incident and UFOs in general, \"It is being used to death.\" One researcher, for example, asked for copies of all documents that Bruce looked at. He pointed out that he had used computer databases to look for information. With several million pages of records represented in each database, the FOIA request had no real meaning. In Bruce's position as the historian for NAIC, he is running a \"one man shop.\" He points out that FOIA requests have seriously interrupted the research he is doing. Bruce recommends that FOIA requests about the Roswell investigation be first di- rected to Congressman Schiff's office since so many government agencies and private sector researchers are directing their information there. \"If I were a UFO re- searcher, that's where I would start,\" he said. Based upon the research he has done, Bruce believes the debris field found by Mac Brazel on the Foster Ranch was the remains of a balloon launched as part of Project Mogul, a subject that has been written about extensively elsewhere, including in the report by Karl T. Pflock en- titled Roswell in Perspective, dated 1994. (This report can be purchased from the Fund for UFO Research, Inc., P.O. Box 277, Mount Rainier, MD 20712.) The project was classified Top Secret at the time and, according to Bruce, this would explain the secrecy of the reported re- covery effort that followed Mac Brazel's find. The Roswell story has obviously not been fully told at this time. Our meeting with Bruce came as the story was undergoing dramatic change and we thought it would be of interest to document that meeting here. We appreciate the time that Bruce spent with us and we believe we haven't heard the last word from him, just as we are cer- tain that we haven't heard the last word from all of the other researchers who have taken an active interest in this story. CORRESPONDENCE Since that meeting last summer, Bruce has continued his work on the Roswell event, finishing up the work for his employer and doing his own personal research, as his family life will allow. We have written to, and talked with, him on occasion, and have received two personal letters. Following are a few meaningful quotes from these letters. Letter dated December 12, 1994: \"I am absolutely convinced that no ET craft, materials, or bodies were in- volved.\" PAGE 4 NUMBER 331 NOVEMBER 1995"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Letter dated December 19, 1994: \"While all of the ins and outs of why people believe what they do about the Roswell Incident would take more than a simple letter to do, let me say that: \"I.I think that the debris field Mac Brazel found is unquestionably Mogul balloon related. The description of the purple flowers and the testimony of Charlie Moore are the two most convincing pieces of evidence for me. \"2. Of all the hundreds of people that R/S claim as eye witnesses, there are only a very few who were adults in 1947 and who actually claim to have seen the material remains and/or what they believe to be bodies. The material described is almost always consistent with the balloon material. I'm not sure that anyone on the plane (that flew the material to Wright Field) remains who actually saw any of the material. \"3. The bodies are a stumper for me. Here are three quick working hypotheses (Emphasis added by the edi- tors so that it is clear that these hypotheses are not con- strued to be explanations.): —Glenn Dennis, et. al., are confusing two or more in- cidents. There may have been some sort of disease/death/airplane accident to account for the bodies and Glenn is mis-remembering it as part of the \"UFO\" incident. —The Roswell newspapers describe a missing com- mercial flight from El Paso (I think) to Roswell. The bodies /debris may belong to that. —There were (and still are) lots of illegal immi- grants that work the farms and ranches around Roswell. The bodies described by Kevin Randle sound very much like the Mexicans-Indians of northern Mexico to me. \"4. I think the testimony of Gen. Exon is open to question, as he himself points out... \"5. I am skeptical about some of the \"threats\" to people not to talk. When I visited Walter Haul in Roswell, he said that he had never been asked/told not to say anything. Of course, he is not a first hand witness to material or bodies. Again, this may also be a case of jumbled memories. \"6. The nurse remains an open question. There are those who believe she is still alive. Again, we do not have her first hand story, just Glenn Dennis' recounting of the nurse story. \"Ultimately, 'true believers' (please excuse the slang) will not be convinced by anything anyone has to say contrary to their belief ... Please don't take what I've written to be official Air Force or NAIC position on the subject. I may be as closed minded as those at the op- posite end of the spectrum, but nothing I have seen convinces me that anything extraterrestrial was involved at Roswell. There are too many plausible, if not yet fully articulated, explanations for the material and the bodies that do not need an ET origin.\" One of the things which drives Bruce \"crazy\" he says is FOIA requests. While he realizes that the FOIA process is a use- ful way for obtaining information, he thinks in the case of the Roswell incident and UFOs in general, \"It is being used to death.\" PART II: LITTLE GREEN MEN There are \"green men\" at Ohio's Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and they appear to be alien. We know. We have seen them. However, contrary to our ufological ex- pectations, they are not \"little.\" It was late May of this year. The General Accounting Office (GAO) investigation into the Roswell, New Mexico flying saucer crash story was reportedly winding down to a closure, Bruce Ashcroft, the historian for the U.S. Air Force's National Air Intelligence Center (NAIC), who had been given the work of going through the records of his organization to see what he could find that related to this story, had completed his efforts. Along the way he had met a lot of people who were, in one way or another, connected to the UFO research community. Stanton Friedman, Phillip Klass, Robert Todd, Kevin Randle, Don Schmitt and many others had offered Bruce their thoughts, opinions, prejudices, and information. We were lucky to have been included in that esteemed assemblage. So, when Bruce called and invited us down for a personal visit to \"see the little green men at Wright-Pat,\" we couldn't turn him down. The trip was to be a bit nostalgic, in that Bruce was soon to be leaving Wright-Pat for a new job as the historian for the Air Training Command at Randolph Air Force Base near San Antonio and Seguin, Texas. Bruce's search through the Air Force records and archives had turned up nothing to indicate that what had occurred at Roswell, New Mexico in July of 1947 was extraterrestrial or alien in nature. He found no records of expense reports indicating that anyone in the Air Force had made an unusual trip to Roswell. Examination of Air Force materials research in the years following the al- leged retrieval of alien material exhibiting unusual prop- erties showed no change that would indicate a leap in the state-of-the-art knowledge expected from such a re- trieval. What Bruce did discover was a vast panoply of Air Force research and testing projects that were rela- tively unknown to the general public which could have, under the right circumstances, led to rumors of alien technology. The problem he faced when attempting to de- termine if any given project could have caused such a ru- mor was the incompleteness of the records. This was not because of any apparent conspiracy. Few of the records Bruce was interested in are now classified. Their in- completeness resulted from a need for private companies doing aerospace research to protect proprietary infor- NOVEMBER 1995 NUMBER 331 PAGES"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL mation involved in unsuccessful projects, poor govern- mental and company record keeping, the passage of time and the resulting need of archivists to periodically cull their archives to allow for the storage of more up-to-date records, and simply the loss of records during moves and long term storage. As a historian, Bruce decries this loss of a part of our technological-history. After many months of effort, Bruce has concluded that the debris field on the Foster Ranch which was found by Mac Brazel is best explained as a downed Mogul bal- loon. This story has been told often enough elsewhere, so there is no need to repeat it here. Bruce believes, but can- not directly prove, that at least two of the Roswell era sto- ries concerning bodies being found in the desert next to crashed space craft can be explained by advanced test de- vices which came down onto the desert floor with ad- vanced forms of anthropomorphic test dummies aboard. During his research he found evidence of the widespread development and use of instrumented human dummies, as well as the use of monkeys and chimpanzees in such research. He believes, with a little luck, further research into this area might unearth archival material that could explain at least some of the flying saucer crash stories which have come out of the southwestern United States over the past forty-five years, the same area where most of this research occurred. Thus, in all of his efforts on behalf of the U.S. Air Force to respond to the GAO inquiry, he had found nothing that was alien — that is, until he helped convene a reunion — an \"alumni day\" — of Blue Book person- nel in 1994 at the twenty-fifth anniversary of the pro- ject's closure.* . During a panel discussion a woman stood up in the audience to tell the story of the not-so-little green men that were still at Wright-Pat. Very few of the attendees were aware of this story, including Bruce. During World War II, from 1943 through 1946, part of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base served as a prisoner of war camp for between 200 to 400 German soldiers. Surprisingly, no records exist on the Base about this camp or who the soldiers were. What evidence has been found elsewhere indicates that the prisoners were Nazi enlisted men captured in North Africa and Italy, and transported to the United States after the POW camps in England became full. Not a single photograph of the prisoners has yet been found. Only recently was the lo- cation of the camp determined with any certainty. It was located on a hilltop at Wright Field in what is now *For the record, all three living Project Blue Book direc- tors, Robert Friend, George Gregory and Hector Quintanilla, attended the reunion. Gus Simpson, the project manager of Battelle Memorial Institute's prime contractor support effort for the project, now retired, was also there. Additional source: Barr, Brian, \"Legacy Puts New Light on POW Mural,\" Skywrighter, Vol. 33, No. 37, pp 1 and 2, Friday, September 18, 1992, Dayton, Ohio. During his research he found evidence of the widespread development and use of instrumented human dummies, as well as the use of monkeys and chimpanzees in such research. He believes, with a little luck, further research into this area might unearth archival material that could explain at least some of the flying saucer crash stories which have come out of the south- western United States over the past forty- five years, the same area where most of this research occurred. Area B. Many of the prisoners worked nearby at what was then Patterson Field, now Areas A and C. These prisoners worked in supply warehouses loading - and unloading rail cars, on the grounds and roads of the base, and served food in the mess halls serving the two Fields. One of the warehouses in Area C was converted into a dining hall for use by the prisoners. That ware- house is now Building 289, across the street from what is now the NAIC's headquarters building. On the walls of the prisoners' mess hall. German POWs had painted a huge mural depicting gargoyle-like folk figures out of Germanic folklore. One of these painted walls survives in a long narrow hallway of the mess hall, now converted to office use. On this wall, about 20 feet high by 70 feet long, appear large, brightly- colored figures with eyelids and lips of red and the skin colored primarily green, with touches of blue and black — the \"little green men\" of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. The wall is now protected as the last surviving sig- nificant remnant of prisoner of war art on U.S. Air Force bases around the country. The wall was dedi- cated in 1992 by then base commander Col. William B. Orellans. It is hoped that the wall will be listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Are these colorful figures really the source of the seemingly endless number of stories that have been shared by UFO researchers over the years about alien bodies that have been studied arid stored at Wright-Pat? Bruce, of course, isn't sure. However, it is possible, he feels, that they played some small part in the folklore that seems to have been created over the years con- cerning the presence of alien bodies on the base. As such, these figures — the colorful mural in Building 289 — deserve at least honorable mention in the compre- hensive history of ufology which most assuredly will one day be written by one of our ancestors. And less we and our ancestors forget, not all folklore is fiction. PAGE 6 NUMBER 331 NOVEMBER 1995"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL BRUCE A. ASHCROFT, M. A. As Bruce leaves his job as the historian for the National Air Intelligence Center (NAIC) in early July, one of the Air Force's unique UFO spokespersons will slip into ufological history. In recent years, no one in the U.S. government has spoken so forthrightly about the subject of UFOs nor been as accessible as has Bruce Ashcroft. Always careful to point out his personal views as sepa- rate from those of the U.S. Air Force, Bruce never once dishonored his profession or his employer. When asked his personal views about UFOs, Bruce replied that if some of the reported sightings are unexplainable from a prosaic point of view, he would guess that the best ex- planation for their source would be other dimensions. He recommended that we read the book Hyperspace — A Scientific Odyssey Through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and The Tenth Dimension by Michio Kaku, pub- lished in 1994 by the Oxford University Press. Part of our visit to Wright-Pat included our atten- dance at the last of Bruce's informal lunch time briefings for National Air Intelligence Center employees in the Center's main conference room on the history of NAIC. The subject of this last one hour briefing was about Project Blue Book. Included in the presentation was a 20-minute videotaped interview that Bruce had arranged earlier between Dayton TV-2 news reporter Carl Day and one-time head of Project Blue Book, Hector Quintanilla, and a rare 1950s tongue-in-cheek \"Movie Tone\" newsreel narrated by Lowell Thomas about the U.S. Air Force's attempt to track down flying saucers us- ing P-51 aircraft. About thirty officers, enlisted men and civilians attended the briefing. After the briefing was over, questions and comments were accepted from the floor. It became quickly quite clear that there is not unanimity of opinion among the employees of the U.S. Air Force about the subject of UFOs. One officer was skeptical that all of the reports about UFOs in Air Force custody had been declassified, including a Secret message that he had once seen re- garding the pursuit of a UFO by an Air Force pilot. He asked Bruce if he thought the message would be un- classified by now. Bruce replied in the affirmative and then reminded everyone that uncleared people were in the room, i.e., us. Fortunately, for the sake of national se- curity, nothing classified had been revealed. Another officer asked Bruce if he had found any ev- idence supporting the often stated view that Project Blue Book was nothing more than a public relations cover for another UFO study project elsewhere. Bruce replied that he had not. Bruce was supported in this view by a response provided by Hector Quintanilla when asked the same question by Carl Day during the videotaped interview noted above. Quintanilla added to his own negative reply by stating that he had no knowledge about other UFO projects, so he couldn't say if there were any. A civilian employee offered a clearly different point of view from Bruce's, noting for the audience that even within the Air Force not all information is shared even among those who have a seeming need to know, as Bruce did during his GAO-initiated investigation. When asked later about this person's views, Bruce replied that this individual seems to like finding conspiracies every- where. It's nice to know that viewpoints concerning UFOs within the Air Force are no different from those that exist within the civilian UFO research community. We all see the subject from different poinis of view. We asked Bruce if he had ever tried to talk with General Arthur B. Exon, the commander of Wright- Patterson Air Force Base starting in August of 1964. General Exon has made a number of seemingly con- firming statements with regard to the flying saucer crash at Roswell, that alien material and bodies had been brought to the base, and that a \"special project\" had been set up to handle the material. Bruce responded that Exon's statements were easily misunderstood and not supportive of the story. He noted that as commander of the base he was responsible for the maintenance of the base infrastructure and, as such, he would not have been privy to all that the various agencies housed on the base were involved in. Bruce believed General Exon's statements had little probative value and, for this reason, he had not been contacted. After leaving the auditorium and returning to the public area of the building, two men in civilian clothing who had been at the briefing approached Bruce and asked him if he had ever talked to a man by the name of John G. Tiffany. It turns out that this individual appar- ently works at Wright-Pat. According to the book The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell by Kevin Randle and Don Schmitt, Tiffany's father was dispatched from Wright Field to pick up the Roswell bodies at Fort Worth. According to Tiffany, as noted in this book, his father picked up metallic debris and a large cylinder that reminded him of a large thermos bottle. It is uncer- tain whether the elder Tiffany ever saw the bodies them- selves, but certainly the father saw something important. The two men asked Bruce if he was going to question Tiffany, and Bruce replied in the negative. He later ex- plained this to us by saying that Tiffany was probably tired of all of the questions about his story from civilian investigators and he probably wouldn't talk to Bruce. We were surprised by the apparent reluctance on Bruce's part to talk to people who were reasonably ac- cessible to him. There may have been some justifiable but unspoken reasons for this in the two instances noted herein. However, given the severe criticism the Air Force received on this very issue with regard to its summary re- port on Roswell, known informally as the Weaver Report, we were understandably sensitive to this issue. His re- luctance left us with the impression that Bruce may have been given the green light to undertake an honest re- search effort, but perhaps within certain boundaries. NOVEMBER 1995 NUMBER 331 PAGE?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL For the record, we asked Bruce if had seen anything in the archives at NAIC which confirmed the existence of and the content of the missing Project Blue Book Report Number 13. Twelve Project Blue Book progress reports are on the public record, as is the final report numbered 14. The existence of 13 has never been con- firmed, although it has been the subject of many ru- mors. Some have said the number 13 wasn't used be- cause the number is \"unlucky,\" and others have said that the number 13 was used for the draft of 14 and was destroyed once the final report was published. We think these two explanations are highly unlikely, and so does Bruce. Bruce replied to our question with a negative re- sponse: Report Number 13 still remains a rumor. W as Bruce in some way acting in a role assigned to him as part of the infamous cover-up? We can't say. There were aspects of his work that some might in- terpret that way, such as his seeming reluctance to in- terview some important witnesses. Bruce voiced his concern on more than one occasion that, because he is an Air Force intelligence employee, people will assume that he is part of the cover-up. He assured us that he is not. Of course, based upon our relationship with Bruce, we can't say for sure. All we can say is that Bruce treated us and the subject of UFOs with respect and he voiced criticisms on more than one occasion concerning how the Air Force had handled various aspects of the UFO question poorly, especially with regard to public re- lations matters. Bruce stated that being more open with information about its past technological history would go a long way toward improving the Air Force's public image. He also was willing to express his personal opin- ions concerning the subject which certainly didn't al- ways follow the party line. If Bruce is a part of the cover-up, he is a refreshing part. In any event, his career is taking him away from the UFO subject as he moves into his new job. His new area of concern will be train- ing. After the excitement of dealing with UFOs, we think Bruce might soon get a bit bored. Bruce leaves his job with a wealth of information, personal contacts inside and outside the government, and a unique point of view. When we asked if he would ever write a book about all of this, he was noncommittal. However, we don't think the world has heard the last of Bruce Ashcroft, his views of UFOs, and the \"little green men' 1 of Wright-Pat. * * * Addendum by Walter H. Andrus, Jr. - The MU- FON UFO Journal is indebted to Bill Jones and Irena Scott for sharing this informal interview with Bruce Ashcroft. Since transferring from Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, to Randolph AFB. Texas, Mr. Ashcroft has ex- tended his UFO interests by joining the Mutual UFO Network and visiting MUFON's UFO Information Center in Seguin, where I had the pleasure of a very en- joyable visit. As announced in the November 1995 \"Director's Message,\" Bruce became a Research Specialist in History, a post he is eminently qualified to fill. Mr. Ashcroft was a contributor to the \"Report of Air Force Research Regarding the 'Roswell Incident,'\" July 1994, that was signed by Richard L. Weaver, Col., USAF. Additional comments by Bruce Ashcroft - 1 hope you'll allow me to clear up a couple of minor points and matters of emphasis that seem to have arisen from the long meeting I had with Bill Jones and Irena Scott just before I left Ohio: First of all, let me say that I have never seen anything that would lead me to believe that extraterrestrial or ex- tradimensional craft and/or beings have visited earth. I consider myself, in the words of James Oberg, a \"sym- pathetic skeptic.\" If, however, there is something to the phenomena popularly known as \"UFOs,\" I think they most likely are manifestations of extradimensionality as described in Hyperspace, mentioned in the MORA arti- cles. Second, the main point of what I try to explain to people is that, in my opinion, military research and de- velopment (R&D) projects, such as those described, for example, in Skunk Works, the autobiography of Ben Rich, account for a large number of UFO sightings. There has been promising research in this area as evi- denced by books such as the recently published Man- Made UFOs authored by Renato Vesco and David Hunter Childress. Further, there were, and possibly still are, R&D pro- jects related to the development of flight suits, helmets, etc. to describe sightings of \"extraterrestrial biological en- tities.\" Finally, at the time I last met with Bill and Irena, I was days from transferring to a new job in Texas. I did not feel a pressing need to contact Mr. Tiffany, especially since he, most likely, was not a first hand witness to Roswell material. Also, one of the researchers with whom I was in contact, possibly Karl Pflock or Carl Day, had commented that Mr. Tiffany had been \"spooked\" and was reluctant to talk to Roswell re- searchers. He did not need me to call him. I was never told whom I could talk to while doing research, but Roswell/UFO research was never my primary job so I had limited time to devote to the project. I need to emphasize that I was just one of many who contributed to the final Air Force report, as evidenced by the lengthy list of acknowledgments. Also, I hope your , readers will not construe anything I've said to be the \"of- ficial\" Air Force position about UFOs or Roswell. By the same token, I have been willing to share the results of my research. Let me say in closing that the Roswell project was probably the most interesting \"case\" I'll ever get to investigate. It was an honor and a privilege to participate in the study.

If you'd like to have it an- alyzed by MUFON's staff photoanalyst, JeffSainio, please follow the following procedures. Also make a copy of these instructions and add them to Section XIV of your MUFON Field Investigator's Manual (Fourth Edition ) for future reference. T hank you for your interest in my services as MU- FON Staff Photoanalyst. I provide free analysis of photo/video evidence in the UFO field. This does not in- clude other phenomena such as Bigfoot, ghosts, or other non-UFO material. Also, due to the ease of scarecrow- making, and the high probability of chance arrange- ments of ordinary objects combining to appear unusual, I do not accept alleged alien-photos, except where the number and quality of witnesses precludes fraud or mis- recognition. As I, like all MUFON members, am unpaid, this service is done on a time-available basis, and cases are processed based on their potential for furthering the understanding of UFOs, equipment availability, and complexity. You will receive a report of any anomalous features of the evidence, usually with halftone enhancements il- lustrating points of interest. In the case of yideo, digital blowup/slowdowns of key points may be provided, usu- ally appended to the videotape you submitted. Unless you object, a copy of the report will go to MUFON International headquarters. Most work is done on digi- tized images, available on floppy disk, viewable on IBM/MAC PCs. In exceptionally compelling cases, I will provide slides illustrating points of interest for your use in slide-shows or public lectures. (If allowed, keep- ing one for my own use!) Although membership in MUFON is encouraged, I have no method of verifying credentials (especially overseas) and therefore perform services for any interested party. Unless otherwise specified, I will: 1. Not release any witness names or identifying in- formation (unless they have voluntarily \"gone public\" with newspaper/TV coverage) but will release investi- gators' names as J deem useful. 2. Return any original evidence such as negatives or Polaroids, but retain copies such as prints and copies I create. 3. Assume videotapes are copies of the originals, and retain them. Mailing costs exceed the tape value. 4. Discuss the material with other photoanalysts, me- teorologists, aircraft experts, etc., as needed to best un- derstand the material. 5. Respect copyright laws, particularly 17 USC 106- 109, involving \"fair use\" of original material. In partic- ular, I will release no material in a manner which allow its copying (in books, newspapers, TV screens, etc.) without permission from the photographer. I may use the material for noncommercial, scientific/educational use, such as educating the public through illustrated lec- tures. I will follow any special instructions given which do not compromise scientific integrity or reasonable cost. In particular, you may specify who the material may be shown to: anywhere from \"show nobody\" to \"use any way you please.\" The more input I get, the more likely an accurate identification will be made. Cases have been identified, years later, this way. The sensitive nature of some cases may prevent this openness. Specify at the end of this form. My recommended method of shipment is the US Postal Service; prices are very reasonable, and speed is moderate. Send to: Jeff Sainio, 2200 Good Hope Rd. #321, Glendale, WI 53209-2763, USA. Sturdy priority mail packages are available at the Post Office, and send up to two pounds for $3.00 with good speed. Be espe- cially careful with videotapes; their sharp corners will shred loose paper wrappers. Cardboard videotape mail- ers or foam 6\"x9\" mailers (3M part#7973 size 0) also work well. If speed is of the essence, the various overnight services may be used. Call me at (414) 246- 7829 (w) or (414) 351-0795 (h) for overnight-service in- structions to my place of employment, where Saturday delivery is available, probably at extra cost from your shipper. What to send? The complete photo evidence. My equipment (designed for analysis of printed material) is best suited for prints, so there is rarely an advantage to risking sending original negatives through the mail. A local investigator can verify what negatives precede/fol- low the UFO shot(s) without risking mailing originals. Slides are also best converted to prints, and the prints mailed.

You may also include enlargements of a feature of interest, but this must be in addition to the complete photo. Often, recognizable terrestrial objects such as tree branches, streetlights, or distant hills, are essential reference objects. Take care in labeling/numbering prints; a ball-point pen may mark-through to damage the image, and slow-drying felt-tips may smear other photos in an envelope. In the case of video, copy the complete videotape at standard (S)VHS speed; other ordinary clips before the UFO video may be needed to determine camera char- acteristics. If I receive PAL/SECAM/BETA(SP)/8mm tapes, they will be translated by a local service, adding a few days delay. Do not perform freeze-frame or slow- motion of the parts of interest; this destroys timing in- formation and is poor-quality on most home equipment. I will do this as necessary on my industrial-grade equip- ment. You may add this to the end of the video to illus- trate interesting points, but an unedited copy of the video is essential. Label the tape; remember I may re- ceive several tapes a week and don't want to mix any up. Broadcast custom is that an unlabeled tape is blank! Any witness testimony, MUFON input forms, or time/day/direction/weather information can be very use- ful. Often, the photo/video evidence is ambiguous in it- self, but corroborates/contradicts witness testimony. It is only a piece of the puzzle, not a key, and the more other puzzle-pieces I have, the better I can interpret the data. Before you get excited, some common photo/video traps to recognize: 1. If a photographer saw nothing unusual until the print was examined, lens flares or film/developing de- fects are usually the cause. Shapeless blobs, or translu- cent spots should not be cause for interest. Only clearly- structured unseen objects will be examined. 2. Most video misidentifications are of Venus or air- planes. They probably account for fully half my sub- missions. A nocturnal fixed point of light, with no anomalous motion, is best called a star. A light, with oc- casional blinks on either side, is probably an airplane running light with wingtip strobe lights. Aircraft light colors are'typically lost (with a white result) on video, so the lack of red-white-green aircraft colors is not sur- prising. Unless a streetlight, star, or other reference ob- ject is seen, UFO \"motion\" may be merely camcorder motion. Unless MO reference points are visible, apparent UFO size changes, or apparent motion toward/away from the reference object, may be merely zoom changes. Also, apparent rotation around a reference point may be merely camera rotation. 3. Video shape changes, from a bright point to a large, diffuse blob, are usually from a \"hunting\" auto-fo- cus mechanism which can't find anything to focus on. The result often looks like the \"Batman\" searchlight. 4. Tiny moving objects seen flitting about, only when a tape is examined, are generally insects or birds ignored during the video. They may be smeared-out from mo- tion, and their small size prevents proper color display. If they happen to fly in front of a background of similar color/brightness, they may appear to fly \"behind\" branches or \"through\" clouds. Remember that as any burglar knows, \"white on white\" or \"black on black\" ob- jects can't be seen and seem to disappear. W hile I have a large amount of UFO evidence, I cannot release copies to others without a release from the photographer, even for purely scientific or ed- ucational, non-commercial purposes. By checking the al- lowable level of disclosure, I can release material as desired. The more widely I can show the material, the more likely it will be properly identified. Responses not requiring a signature may be communicated in other ways (such as phone) than this form. Be sure to specify one of the following: • Show the material to nobody, not even other trusted analysts. Signature not required. • Show/copy the material to other experts as needed only; do not show publicly. A copy of my report will go to MUFON headquarters. Signature not required.

The computer network worldwide as been an incredibly helpful aide in getting information from trustworthy re- searchers such as George Wingfield in England and other expert opinions worldwide. Comments taken di- rectly from an interview with the alleged cameraman and medical reactions from a doctor in Berlin, Germany shall provide further perspective on this confusing film. According to filmmaker Santilli's alleged transcrip- tion of his interview with this cameraman, the photog- rapher states, \"It was June 1st when McDonnell (St. Louis aircraft company) asked me to report to General McMullen for a special assignment... I was ordered to a crash site just southwest of Socorro.\" Recently, it was further indicated that the actual crash occurred May 31, 1947 — certainly long before the July 5-8th time period of the Roswell crash! The cameraman goes on to say. \"My brief was to film everything in sight, not to leave the debris until it had been removed, and I was to have access to all areas of the site,\" He then says later in the interview. \"I stayed at Wright-Patterson for a further three weeks working on the debris — I was told to re- port to Ft. Worth . . . The first two autopsies took place on July 1st and 3rd, 1947.\" According to the cameraman's own words the crash occurred a full month before the autopsies were per- formed and filmed! So, how fresh could either the blood or the bodies be? Researcher George Wingfield asked a pathologist, Dr. Chris Milroy, who responded, \"One would only expect to see blood trickle from an in- cision if one was dealing with a very fresh corpse. Blood flow is fairly minimal even after just four hours deceased. If this body had lain in the desert for any time, there is remarkably little sign of decomposition.\" The cameraman has also indicated that one of the de- ceased aliens had on a \"tight garment which was holding in heat and hastening decomposition\" while in the tent, which then \"took sheet metal cutters to cut it off.\" Remember that the cameraman said he was to stay at the site filming everything and then was at Wright Field for another three weeks! According to Philip Mantle of BUFORA, he has wit- nessed both autopsy sequences of two similar but dif- ferent creatures — apparently in the same room — and in neither case is an actual cause of death obvious — es- pecially the second. less viewed sequence in which the body seems intact. I have noted in a supposed uncut ver- sion sent to me of the well publicized autopsy sequence that there are many cuts and jumps in time as evidenced by the clock on the wall. I noted that the surgeons' gloves never seem to get bloody either. It is even more bothersome that the crash and two autopsies allegedly occurred all before the actual well-documented Roswell crash occurred between July 5-8. 1947. Obviously, the location and description of the crash site is clearly dif- ferent as well — \"it was a large disc on its back with heat still radiating from the ground around it... south- west of Socorro.\" If this is an actual crash with retrieval of bodies, then it is not the Roswell incident and all comparisons to the Roswell research should cease at once to eliminate confusion. N aturally, the next major question should be, \"Could this be another alien body?\" In my last column, I ran through comparisons with data from hundreds of ac- counts with types of alien contacts and abductions, list- ing my doubts and describing features that are essen- tially more human than alien. Now we can add the perspective of a doctor's report from Berlin, Germany. Here are some of his observations: \"In medical terms, having more than five digits on the hands or feet is a genetic variation called polydactylism. There are approximately 34 syndromes in which poly- dactylism of the fingers is present, 36 syndromes in which the same occurs with toes. In approximately 12 syndromes hexadactylism (six digits) of the fingers is present, and 13 with hexadactylism of the toes. Note the description of one syndrome in particular: Extreme growth of the head, widespread eyes and deep eye sock- ets, a broad-based nose, increased growth of the base of the skull, a crescent-shaped skin fold at the inner upper eyelid, mongoloid axis of the eyelid, no hair between the eyebrows, lowering of the outer ear — which is small, small lips, lower jaw underdeveloped, low birth weight, short length at birth (dwarf-like), unproportioned growth (dyschondroplasia), multiple variations of the ribs, breastbone, hip, knee; malformations of inner organs possible, and poly or hexadactylism. This description is not that of an alien, but of a human being who suffers from C-syndrome, or in the American medical literature, from Opitz Trigonocephaly Syndrome. Only a few cases have been described formally, and those died very young. Still, the description indicates the variation pos- sible in humans. For a syndrome to be diagnosed, key symptoms must exist, but not all symptoms have to be present. A human being could have some symptoms of a particular syndrome, but not all, and that human could live to early adulthood.\" Regarding the outfits and manner of the \"surgeons\" themselves, our German doctor offers these comments: \"The two individuals in white contamination suits, com- plete with hoods and narrow rectangular glass face- plates could not have been wearing these for protection from radiation because in a previous film shown by Santilli (the tent scene), the 'doctors' were seen exam- NOVEMBER 1995 NUMBER 331 PAGE 1 1"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL ining the body without protective suits. Jesse Marcel, Sr. has testified that no radiation was detected at the crash site. (Remember that the cameraman was at the crash site and with wreckage long before he, too, put on the protective suit!) The suits could not have been for pro- tection from the odor of a decaying body (what decay?) — nor for protection against unknown bacteria or viruses. In either situation some sort of breathing ap- paratus would have been required to guard against air- borne organisms. So, it is likely that the strange outfit worn by the doctors had a different purpose (like the man in similar garb watching behind the window) — to conceal their identities! It is hard to understand why only two doctors were in attendance and why only one camera was operating amateurishly. It should have been performed very carefully and methodically, perhaps over several weeks' time. Careful motion picture film- ing and many slides and/or still photos would have re- sulted for the best photographic record possible. Nothing done by the film's doctors seems to indicate that they were aware of handling something of extraordinary value to mankind. The whole scene looked unpleasant and somehow illegal.\" The debate shall no doubt continue .. . but one must wonder about the timing of this whole event, coming just after a year in which more positive attention has been focused on the Roswell incident than ever before. A cleverly-orchestrated hoax would achieve the confu- sion and debates that this has had in distracting us from our regular and more important research efforts.

MUFON ON-LINE! Dennis Stacy Check us out at: http://www.rutgers.edu/~mcgrew/MUFON A not-so-quiet revolution is currently underway in the computing world. In fact, you may already be tired of all the hype and hoopla surrounding the World Wide Web and the Internet when, in truth, you haven't heard or seen anything yet. Businesses, from the small- est to the largest, are presently flocking to the WWW and individual \"home pages\" in the same way that they first flocked to the telephone, and then the copy and fax machine. By the year 2000, if not before, a home page will be as axiomatic and indispensable for commercial transactions and communications as an ad in the Yellow Pages is now. Much the same will be true for individuals and sci- entific research organizations. You don't have to have something to sell in order to take advantage of the vast amount of information out there, and the ability to ex- change data at relatively high speeds. Sound and static graphics are already available on the Web, with video and 3-D images now emerging at an accelerating rate. The potential for reaching out and touching someone is expanding exponentially. Unlike a person-to-person long-distance call, the WWW allows access to millions of computer users worldwide with no drop-off in speed or quality because of distance. Access is as immediate as your modem connection permits. Unfortunately, access is not entirely cost-free, al- though entirely modest in terms of the potential benefits. You'll need to pay an Internet provider for access, which typically runs between $10 and $20 a month, depending on the amount of time spent online. Many standalone providers — their ranks are growing daily — will allow unlimited hours and possibly even throw in personal home page space for the higher rate. The commercial online services like CompuServe, America Online, NOVEMBER 1995 NUMBER 331 PAGE 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Prodigy and others, have also begun offering Internet ac- cess and the software necessary to effect same. \"Hidden costs\" include such essentials as a larger hard drive and a faster modem, but the prices on these plummet al- most weekly. You can \"survive\" on the Web with a 14.4 modem, but eventually you'll want a 28.8, typically available for around $200. It may not be wholly a case of \"get wired or get left behind,\" but it is safe to say that if you don't try it you won't know what you're missing. And now you have another reason to get wired. Beginning last month, the Mutual UFO Network now has its own home page on the World Wide Web. In Web parlance, the page is still \"under construction,\" in that its contents are not yet complete. Part of it is pro- visional and subject to revision, part of it is experimen- tal. If you currently have Internet access, go to your Web browser (Netscape Navigator is highly recom- mended, although not absolutely necessary) and visit us at http://www.rutgers.edu/~mcgrew/MUFON. T he idea of establishing MUFON's presence on the Web grew out of a proposal by Charles McGrew and myself to the late UFO research coalition fund, before the financial backing for that program was withdrawn by its donor. McGrew is a computer systems programmer for Rutgers University who also edits the online \"X- Files\" newsletter. Thanks to an assignment for the forth- coming electronic version of Omni magazine, I had be- gun to learn the Hyper-Text Mark-up Language (HTML) employed by the World Wide Web. So, while our progress was somewhat initially slowed, MUFON's provisional home page is now up and running for your perusal and comments. And I should emphasize that the overwhelming majority of computer expertise in- volved, as well as the majority of the hard work, was provided by Mr. McGrew, for whose contributed ser- vices, all of MUFON owes a considerable debt. As I said, the current MUFON home page is provi- sional in that neither its final form or contents are com- plete. Once same is finalized, there are several mecha- nisms for publishing our presence on the World Wide Web. In the meantime, please check out the site and let us know what you think. While primarily designed as an informational service for those new to the UFO phe- nomenon and MUFON. we also want the Web page to be of benefit to MUFON members as well, whose dues and contributions make it possible. We should add that the new Web page is in no way intended to replace or supercede the MUFON UFO Journal and other organizational activities, but to com- plement them. Some portions of the Journal, however, such as the \"Calendar\" and \"Night Sky\" sections, may be published online as a way of informing the general public of upcoming events and certain astronomical phenomena that may be misperceived as UFOs. Brief excerpts or abstracts from feature articles may also be posted, along with current sighting reports. We emphasize again that the MUFON WWW home page is a public education service. While much of the in- formation thereon will remain static, other data would ideally be updated on a regular basis and, like the Journal itself, would require an editor to do so. Because of continuing paper costs increases, the Journal will probably be forced to raise its subscription rates later this year or early next. With the addition of MUFON online, we hope that our readers will feel that they are getting more, not less, for their subscription dollars. So if you have a computer, modem and Internet ac- cess, please check out MUFON's home page and let us know what you think. Send comments, suggestions and criticisms to the editor.

Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies (CU- FOS), announces forthcoming changes in the periodic- ity of that organization's bi-monthly publication, the International UFO Reporter. For the last nine years, says Rodeghier, the cost of becoming an Associate of CUFOS and receiving the 1UR has held steady at $25.00 per year. During that same time period, however, the cost of paper, printing and postage has continued to rise, with more increases expected in paper prices later this year. The CUFOS board has decided that rather than in- crease membership costs, the number of lURs per year will instead be decreased, to five issues in 1995, and to four beginning in 1996, to be labeled Winter, Spring. Summer and Fall. This year's Sept/Oct and Nov/Dec numbers will be combined into a single issue. The Center said that it also hoped to add four more pages of articles, features, photos and graphics per issue in order to partially reduce the impact of fewer publication dates. As might be expected. MUFON has had to bear sim- ilar cost increases, multiplied by the fact that we now print and mail over 5200 copies per month. While there are no plans to reduce the number of issues printed, a proposal to increase MUFON's annual membership dues from $25 to $30 a year is presently under consid- eration by the Board of Directors. The results of their de- liberations may be known as early as next month. It has now been nine and a half years since MUFON has had to consider raising membership dues; it does so now only because of spiraling conditions beyond our control. Your support, under the circumstances, is of course greatly appreciated. — Dennis Stacy PACE 14 NUMBER 331 NOVEMBER 1995"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL AIR FORCE ROSWELL REPORT The following product announcement was recently re- ceived from the U.

Now, she is worried about her teenage daughter, Katie (Candace Cameron. \"Full House\"), who is behaving strangely, spacing out in school and sneaking out of the house late at night. Bizarre things are also happening in their quiet rural town as well — things that Sheriff Marcus Ashbee (Midkiff), Judith's childhood friend, suspects are just teenage pranks. When Judith seeks help from a hypno- therapist, she begins to unlock some frightening mem- ories. She thinks she might be losing her mind until the nightmares become all too real. In the shocking conclusion, she and Katie must face together the fears that have terrified her for years. \"Visitors of the Night\" features animatronic aliens and special effect created by Steve Johnson at XFX Inc. Steve's credits include the creatures for the feature film \"The Abyss\" and the Showtime movie \"Roswell,\" as well as the current Energizer commercials.

It was no small feat, then, for a young boy to come up with seven dollars and fifty cents for his first hardback. \"This had better be good,\" I said to myself as I placed the order, piling my change on the counter top. \"This had better be real good.\" I couldn't help but think that I could have bought 30 paperbacks for the same price. Were the hard covers alone really that expen- sive? The deed done, though, the waiting began, which in some ways proved harder than had the saving of the original $7.50.1 had some practice at patience, or rather impatience, having ordered my share of baseball cards through the mail. But this was my first experience at or- dering a book a bookstore didn't already have on its shelves, and it proved interminable. I probably drove the owner to distraction with my daily calls inquiring whether or not my book had finally come in. I must have ordered it during summer, else I would have had my own distractions in the form of school. But all I could do was wait. Finally, the call came in. and then I had to wait some more, until my mother could drive me halfway across, town to pick it up. The clerk placed it on the counter, and my feeling was one of relief. At least it was big. 1125 pages. In fact, it took two boy-sized hands to pick it up. But the long wait was over. Back in the car, I laid the massive volume in my lap. While mother drove. I opened the cover and began to read from The Books of Charles Fort. My first impressions were severalfold. Unlike Frank Edwards and even lesser paperback chroniclers of the odd and unusual. Fort (1875-1932) wrote with sryle. It was a difficult, sometimes almost impenetrable, style, but a uniquely recognizable voice.nonetheless, even to a young voracious reader like myself, normally uncon- cerned with such things. And Fort didn't just tell stories, he commented and speculated on events with a mind all his own. Again, unlike most of his \"successors,\" Fort gave specific (often scientific) sources for his stories. Also, there was a massive index, probably the first one I ever encountered. Suddenly, seven-fifty seemed like a small bargain. Over the next couple of weeks I would fall asleep with Fort at my side nightly. I didn't know it at the time, but. for better or worse, Fort had already changed my life. The fork came a few years later, after my junior year in high school. I had won a National Science Foundation summer scholarship and wound up taking a geology course at Texas A & M University. The last week or so of the course — co-taught by an A & M and University of Oregon geologist — involved a field trip around the state of Texas. While on the beach near Galveston, another student and I found several obsidian-like chips in the sand and asked the Oregon professor what they were. He said they were parts of some sort of organism — I've long forgot- ten the scientific name — washed down a river to the Gulf. As we walked away, the A & M professor ap- proached. Probably somewhat full of our newfound knowledge, we opened our hands and said, \"Hey, look at these so-and-so's.\" He looked at our open palms and said, \"Those aren't so-and-so's, those are sharks' teeth!\" This is the sort of thing that leaves an impression on im- pressionable minds. Were they or weren't they so-and-so's or sharks' teeth? And if our professors didn't know — or couldn't agree — how were we ever supposed to know? The second significant event occurred a few days later, as our bus passed through Austin, home of the University of Texas, A & M's hated football rival. During the short rest stop, two other students and 1 bought UT T-shirts and baseball caps. As we reentered the bus, the A & M geologist saw what we had bought and went ballistic. Up until then everyone in the unair- conditioned bus had been rotating seats on a daily basis because the three rear seats sat over the bus's engine and were extremely uncomfortable. For the remainder of the trip, me and my \"compadres in crime\" were as- signed the dread hot seats. I don't know about you, but this struck me as somewhat unscientific behavior. To this day, I have not figured out what football and geology have in common. The upshot, though, was that instead of majoring in geology at A & M — a then potentially lucrative career, given the state's vast oil and natural gas deposits — 1 wound up an English major at the University of Texas. Whether this is my loss — or gain — or society's, has yet to be fully determined. Whatever the ultimate outcome, blame it on Fort. But it would be wrong, as many do, to label Fort sim- ply anti-scientific, as Bob Rickard, the esteemed co-edi- tor of England's Fortean Times, points out in his intro- duction to the first paperback edition of Fort's Book of the Damned (the first of four he wrote) in some 16 years. \"He was wrongly dubbed 'the arch-enemy of science,'\" Rickard writes, \"when he makes it perfectly clear that his targets were the demagogues in all fields of knowledge — not just science — who mislead themselves, their col- leagues and the public by insisting on the sanctity of dogma and authority.\" Fort simply used the findings, non-findings and pronouncements from on high of sci- entists themselves, particularly regarding those facts that didn't quite seem to fit any prevailing assumptions — the PAGE 16 NUMBER 331 NOVEMBER 1995"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL \"damned\" of the book's title — as his field of expression of a much larger theme, namely, the continuity, or inter- connectedness, of all phenomena and events. In Fort's own phrase, the philosophy of the hyphen. He could just as easily have tackled politics or religion. In the process of concentrating on odd lights, animals and strange slashings (to name but a few of his chosen subjects), however. Fort essentially fathered modern ufology, not to mention cryptozoology, and our prevailing fascination with cattle mutilations, spontaneous human combustion, and other equally damned data. He even coined the word \"telepor- tation,\" now a sci-fi and Star Trek staple. According to Fort, belief is based on answers, and once you arrive at \"certain\" answers, you are all but damned yourself because now it is you who are doing the damning — by excluding all other \"answers\" and phenomena. Fort himself wanted to substitute (tempo- rary) acceptance for belief, saying that \"firmly to believe is to impede development,\" while \"only temporarily to accept is to facilitate.\" Tomorrow, in others' words, brings only new developments, which, in turn, give rise to ever newer beliefs (or merely confirm and solidify old ones). Why believe today, argues Fort, what may be overturned, revized, or proven not \"true\" tomorrow? Unfortunately, suspension of certainty doesn't come easily to us humans. To paraphrase the Doors, we want our answers and we want them now. Uncertainty and ambivalence are out, certainty (even if ultimately un- certain) and assuredness are in. OJ is guilty or he isn't. Capitalism is good, socialism bad. The Cowboys will win the Super Bowl and all UFOs are from outer space. After awhile the Greys begin to grow on you. \"As to what I am trying to do now — I accept only.\" said Fort. \"If I can't see universally, I can only localize.\" And to localize is to exclude, or damn, by definition, ab- solute or overarching knowledge — the ability to see universally — being denied us all. To localize, then, is human nature, Fort's version of \"original sin.\" \"The fate of all explanation,\" goes another one of his emi- nently quotable aphorisms, \"is to close one door only to have another fly wide open.\" The unfortunate fact of the matter is that many be- lievers in Fort — or at least many of his intellectual off- spring, ufologists included — have probably misunder- stood their object of adoration as much, if not more so. than his critics. Certainly many seem to have lost, or never to have acquired, Fort's innate subtle sense of humor, perhaps nowhere better illustrated than in the fol- lowing excerpt from his final book, Wild Talents: \"In days of yore, when I was an especially bad young one, my punishment was having to go to the store, Saturdays, and work. I had to scrape off labels of other dealers' canned goods, and paste on my parents' label. Theoretically, I was so forced to labor to teach me the er- rors of deceitful ways. A good many brats are brought up, in the straight and narrow, somewhat deviously. \"One time I had pyramids of canned goods, contain- ing a variety of fruits and vegetables. But I had used all except peach labels. I pasted the peach label on peach cans, and then came to apricots. Well, aren't apricots peaches? And there are plums that are virtually apricots. I went on, either mischievously, or scientifically, pasting the peach labels on cans of plums, cherries, string beans, and succotash. I can't quite define my motive, because to this day it has not been decided whether I am a hu- morist or a scientist. I think that it was mischief, but, as we go along, there will come a more respectful recog- nition that also it was scientific procedure.\" T iffany Thayer, the original secretary of the Fortean Society (which Fort himself refused to join), said to read Fort was to take a ride on a comet. 1940's hyper- bole aside, there is some metaphorical truth to the state- ment. But if the perpetually modest Fort was earth- shaking in any way, it was because he transmitted a message not so much of what to think, as how to think. We can only ask ourselves why, in the absence of so lit- tle recurring hard evidence, so many of us are so willing to swallow so much ethereal codswallop when it comes to the subject of UFOs.

The Edwards Air Force Base Encounter: The U.S. Air Force vs. UFOs Audiodocumentary produced by Samuel M. Sherman, Independent International Pictures Corp., N.J., 1995; 54 mins. Reviewed by Elaine Douglass N o one reading this needs further proof of the reality of UFOs—but perhaps your friends do? If so, pay attention to the newly issued audio documentary, \"The Edwards Air Force Base Encounter.\" \"Come over to my place,\" you tell your friends. \"I've got something to play for you.\" You know the friends I mean—the ones who get a pained expression on their faces everytime you bring up the subject of UFOs. \"What's that?\" they want to know. You answer nonchalantly. \"Oh, just a tape of some Edwards Air Force Base guys, 1965, wondering what they're going to do about the 12 UFOs that have been sitting over the base for the last five hours. \"Air traffic people, officers, pilots, people like that,\" you add, \"talking about objects they're seeing on three kinds of radar, that military people from 50 miles around Edwards are on roof tops watching, objects with red, green, and white flashing lights about 5,000 feet over the runway at Edwards. They're saying the objects are 'def- initely not moving fast enough or constant enough to be aircraft,' and they're asking each other, 'Should we send up a fighter jet to have a closer look?' \"Just Edwards' guys,\" you tell your friends, \"on the phone, on base radio, and talking to the fighter pilot in the air, going through the drill with each other: Do you see what I see? Is it birds, planes, weather balloons? What the hell is that, anyway?\" \"Real military guys?\" your friends ask. \"Sounds like a genuine Air Force tape to me,\" you answer. \"Your tax dollars at work. It certainly wasn't recorded by a 'yoo-fologist.'\" Next night your friends show up. They've got the same smirk on their faces they always have, same con- descending smile. But this time you're ready. Adjust the dials on your stereo surround sound with the fancy woofers and tweeters, or just drag out your boom box, turn the lights down, play this 54-minute tape for your friends, and watch their jaws drop. No more smirks now. They'll be stunned and so .will you when you hear \"The Edwards Air Force Base Encounter: the U.S. Air Force vs. UFOs,\" just released by Independent International Pictures Corp. of New Jersey. This tape is dynamite, and at $17 it's a \"must have.\" Remember the UFO incursions over military bases documented in Clear Intent by Fawcett & Greenwood? This tape is of an event like that — October 7, 1965, over Edwards AF Base in California, 1:30 AM to 7 AM. The Air Force called it \"The Incident,\" and recorded all the phone and radio calls associated with the event. New Jersey film maker Sam Sherman found the tape in the open literature. Sherman, who owns Independent Intl., spent nearly a year turning the original six hours of raw audio into a documentary, complete with music and narration. Sherman also had the sound digitally enhanced. His biggest enhancement, however, was locating Chuck Sorrels, the air traffic controller on duty at Edwards during the 1965 event, and heavily involved in it. In 1965, Sorrels (now retired) was a tech sergeant/air controller attached to the 1925th Communications Squadron at Edwards. He vectored the F106-fighter launched that morning about 5 AM. By then the UFOs had ascended to 40,000 feet and Sorrels directed the pi- lot from the images on his radar screen. You can hear him on the 1965 portion talking to the pilot, and also in the documentary portion making a statement recorded May 1995 in which he confirms the reality of the Edwards UFO incident and the authenticity of the tapes. If there was any doubt about the bona fides of the Edward's tape, Sorrels' statement resolves it. A number of other personnel on the tape are identified by name, and various elements of the AF command are also identified. Indeed, it's clear from the tape that the upper levels of command are familiar with UFOs. And that's interesting, but it's not what's important about this tape. What's important about the Edwards tape is its dramatic and undeniably real audio. We already had paper (documentary) proof of such incidents from Clear Intent. But with this tape we now have the sound of the live, actual military response to a UFO incursion and if that's not proof that UFOs are real and the military knows it, I don't know what is. Listen to the tape and it's obvious the Air Force isn't chasing geese. You hear the guys rule out every known object, one by one. The radar returns show the UFOs are solid, physical objects, and when they get visual and radar confirmation of objects hovering at 5,000 feet PAGE 18 NUMBER 331 Continued on Page 20 NOVEMBER 1995"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Letters to Mufon UFO Journal UFO SIGHTING On Sunday, 19 March, 1995, 5:25 AM PST, I observed a UFO traveling east towards Seattle, from my location in Silverdale. Washington. My name is Thomas Huston. I am 15 years old and was 14 at the time ot\" the sighting. I live in Silverdale.WA, which is near Bremerton. Please do not doubt the credibility of this report due to my age. It was Sunday morning. I was delivering newspa- pers on my route, with my dad driving me in his car. I got out of the car with a newspaper in hand, and started walking down the driveway to place the paper in the pa- per-box. I looked up and saw an extremely bright white light pass directly over me and I watched it move in a straight line until trees obscured my view of the ob- ject. The light traveled fast, approximately 600 mph. It ap- peared about the size (and shape) of an undistorted full moon. It appeared to be no more than 1500 ft. high. The object was completely silent. When I could no longer see the object I ran back to the car and asked my dad if he saw it. He said he didn't; he had been leaning over, getting papers out of the back of the car. The object was not a jet, helicopter, or air- plane. Jet engines make noise, helicopters make noise, and no helicopter or propeller plane I know of can fly that fast. None of the three types of aircraft would fly very well with a huge bright circular light affixed to the bottom of the craft. Given the apparent height of the ob- ject a light source of that size attached to the bottom of them would have to be larger than the aircraft itself, un- less it was a \"silent-running\" jet or helicopter Hying only 200 ft. above me! There.are no landing lights (on any known aircraft) of that size and magnitude. I am thoroughly convinced that what I saw was not any type of known aircraft. This is the only definite UFO that I have ever seen. I now carry a camera with me on the route, and I watch the sky. — Tom Huston Silverdale, WA EARTHLIGHTS HOKUM My name is Keith M. King, and I'm a new member of MUFON (about two months' worth of membership), so I'm probably opening up myself to the expected ridicule I deserve. Nevertheless. I was never one to suppress my true feelings, and I see no reason to start now. After reading my first edition of the MUFON UFO Journal. I am utterly dismayed at what I've found. Perhaps my ex- pectations were out of line with what you folks aim to accomplish with this publication. If so, let me apologize right here and now. However, my initial observation is that this has the feel of a scientific journal, as opposed to a paper devoted to the general public. Have I misinter- preted anything here? You tell me. The first article en- titled, \"Meeting With The Alien,\" by Paul Devereux, was, to put it bluntly, some of the most pompous rubbish I think I've read about the subject of abductions to this date! To say that everyone who has ever had one of these extremely harrowing experiences has probably been the victim of child abuse is not only offensive in its implication, but downright stupid! Surely MUFON does not ascribe to this cavalier and ludicrous opinion! The author goes on to state that most, if not all, ad- ditional sightings are no more than gaseous anomalies whose origin is wholly organic in nature. Are we really suppose to accept this nonsense as a valid explanation for the volumes of stupendous and awesome sightings of aircraft, some measuring as long as 300 feet in length and seen in broad daylight? A lot of these ships are seen by highly qualified observers at altitudes of over 30,000 ft.! I suppose that these are also \"earth lights,\" as he so blithely calls them. Earth lights that conveniently take the form of a highly polished, definitely metallic, cigar-shaped aircraft traveling at unwavering speeds in excess of 800 to 1000 miles per hour cruising speed, and over 17,000 mph at other times. Really, sir, are we ac- tually being asked to embrace this brazen dribble as re- ality? I, for one, do not. Perhaps Mr. Devereux intended for this diatribe to impress his brother scientists, but it is nothing more than I would expect from someone who had never quaked in abject fear beneath one of these alien vehicles or been physically assaulted by a being whose very appearance was in itself a completely de- bilitating experience. Has Mr. Devereux ever been ab- ducted? Probably not. Has he ever had a close encounter with any of his supposed \"earth lights\" for real? Has he ever come into contact with an occupant of a UFO at anytime in his studies? If he has answered \"No\" to any one of these questions, then I submit that Mr. Devereux is not an authority on the subject. It is relatively easy to make assessments of a situation from a vicarious position, having had no actual experi- ence with it. If I tell you that I know what it is to fight in a war (even though I've studied and talked to literally hundreds of war veterans, specifically Vietnam veterans, over a period of 18 years), then I would not be telling the truth. Only they who actually fought could tell us what it really felt like during a rocket attack, or the intensity of emotions that overwhelmed you during a fire fight. Only they would be qualified to elaborate on the ef- fects that killing multiple times has on a person in the short and long term, and so on. So also, when we're talk- ing about a subject as inexplicable as abductions, then I submit that the only people qualified to expound with any amount of authority would be the abductees them- selves, yes? We can certainly refuse to accept what we are being told by these people as a right of free will, but to blatantly, and in my mind, cruelly call them, in effect. NOVEMBER 1995 NUMBER 331 PAGE 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL delusional, is not called for and very unfair. I submit that this man has not talked to very many abductees in per- son by what he says in this article. I suggest that he do a little more research into this area and maintain the open mind that scientists are supposedly noted for. As to his ideas on most aerial sightings, I guess that his earth lights theory could account for a reasonable percentage of the UFOs being reported by the general population. However, here, too, we are being asked to swallow a decidedly unpalatable mix which Mr. Devereux serves up with a side dish of disdain for the obvious. Perhaps he would be better suited writing for the Air Force as opposed to a UFO journal. It's not that I fear or reject responsible criticism of the subject of ufology. Not at all. Criticism is not only welcomed, but I believe is actually needed in order to apply the balance required to sift the actual from fantasy. But really . . . Earth Lights, indeed! Let me tell you a fact, my friends, we are being visited by an alien race or races, and have been for quite some time. This is the obvious. The only thing that we haven't deciphered is their final agenda. Let the others such as Ground Watch and SETI aim their radio telemetry equipment into space in the hopes of finding an \"answer\" to their forlorn entreaties. I wish them success in whatever they believe they are doing. Why they are unable to identify a tree in the midst of a well planted forest, though, is beyond my ability to comprehend. — Keith M. King Fairway, KS You raise many questions here, Mr. King. Unfortunately, not all of them can be addressed to your apparent sat- isfaction, partly because of a lack of space, and partly because it would require an itemized, point-by-point rereading of Devereux's entire article. As but one ex- ample to which you object, Mr. Devereux notes that \"abductees as a group tend to have suffered a higher than average background of child abuse. \" This is not Mr. Devereux's \"cruel\" opinion or assertion on the matter, but the results of a significant psychological study by Dr. Kenneth Ring of the University of Connecticut, published as The Omega Project (pp. 138- 9), for which the author provides a footnote. Ring also found that near-death experiences scored higher on incidents of childhood abuse and trauma than control subjects. The question, of course, is what do his findings mean, or signify? One can simply ignore them, of course, or one can try to draw a correlation, as Mr. Devereux did, whether or not you agree with him and his other attempts at correlations (altered states of con- sciousness, lucid dreaming, EM field effects, etc.) which go far beyond mere earth lights in general. I suppose, if one wanted to, that one could argue that aliens only abduct humans with troubled childhoods, although cu- rious minds would still like to know why. Devereux's article was published not to push a par- ticular point of view down anyone's throat, but for the in- dividual reader's consideration, who remains free to reject, rebut — or merely consider it — in whole or in part. If we took only one point of view — and never pub- lished anything critical or contrary — we would be- come a pretty boring journal. I agree with you that the only expert on anyone's ex- perience is the individual himself. But surely the rest of us are allowed to study, consider and comment upon those experiences — else there would be nothing such as psychology and sociology, to name but two disciplines.

Mars (1.2), in Sagittarius, begins to fade from view in the WSW. Venus sets about 6:30 PM in mid-December; Mars, about 5:30. Saturn (1.1), in Aquarius, lies in the S at twilight, setting in the W about 1 1 PM in midmonth. Jupiter Probe Arrives: After a 6-year journey, the Galileo spacecraft finally reaches its destination, Jupiter. Having separated from the orbiter craft, the entry probe on December 7 plunges into the giant planet's atmosphere like a meteor, slowing its descent by its heat shield and parachute. The probe will relay data to the mother craft for about 75 minutes before ceasing transmission. The orbiter then circles the planet to commence a 22-month orbital survey of Jupiter and its largest satellites. Meteor Shower: The Geminids peak on the night of December 13-14. Because a bright gibbous Moon rises about 10:30 PM, the best time to view the show this year is before that time. The Geminid ra- diant point rises in the NE at 6 PM. So watch for these bright, relatively slow meteors in the eastern sky during the evening. The shower occurs in lesser numbers from about the 7th to the 15th. Moon Phases: Full moon—December 6 Last quarter—December 15 New moon—December 21 First quarter—December 28 O The Stars: By 9 PM, the summer stars have almost disappeared in the W; the autumn stars are past the meridian: and the winter groups with their brilliant luminaries dominate the SE sky. Look for the Great Hunter Orion, his shoulders marked by reddish Betelgeuse and bluish-white Bellatrix, his belt by three stars in a row. and his legs by Saiph and Rigel. To the left of Orion is Gemini the Twins. Pollux and Castor mark the heads of the two brothers. Below the hunter rises the brightest star Sirius. And to Orion's right charges the Bull Taurus, his face outlined by the Hyades cluster and his orange eye Aldebaran. The famous little dipper-shaped star cluster in the bull's shoulder, the Pleiades, rises to a commanding over- head position in midevening.

JOURNAL RENEWAL NOTICES Starting with the September 1995 issue of the Journal, only three renewal notices will be enclosed in the front of the magazine. Everyone will be advised twice in advance that their membership/subscription will ex- pire within two months. Please renew when you receive the first notice, especially in foreign countries where it takes two to three months for surface mail to be deliv- ered, to preclude not missing a single issue. The last no- tice will indicate with a red check that your subscription \"expires with this issue.\" Due to economic measures, a complimentary copy with a renewal notice having a red stamp marked \"Expired\" has been discontinued. If a person allows their subscription to expire, it will be resumed with the next current issue. Back issues, when available, may be purchased for $3 each for those that you may have missed. When new members join, their first issue will begin with the next current issue. We recommend and encourage a subscriber who has moved or changed their address to notify MUFON with a letter, postcard or the Postal Service \"PS Form 3576, May 1994\" (or the Canadian equivalent). MUFON cannot be held responsible for replacing copies which the postal service is unable to deliver and subsequently destroys. Second class mail is not forwarded by the Post Office unless the subscriber has guaranteed to pay for the ad- ditional postage or made special arrangements. The U.S. Postal Service advises MUFON via Form 3579 and charges 50 cents for a change of address notification. These procedures are being reviewed with our sub- scribers in the interest of providing more efficient ser- vice to our members. At the same time, we need your help to guarantee that your subscription continuity is maintained. SEATTLE SYMPOSIUM VIDEOTAPES We are proud to announce that Eddie J. Melvin has been delivering videotapes of the 14 speakers at the MUFON 1995 International UFO Symposium in Seattle, WA. They are available in several combina- tions and prices include shipping. A single speaker tape is $26.95 and all 14 speakers is priced at $149.95 in the U.S.A. Orders from some foreign countries must be converted to the PAL recording system. Single speaker tapes converted cost $56.95, whereas all 14 speakers cost only $184.95. If your country uses the NTSC sys- tem, like the U.S.A., so specify in your order so the con- version price will not apply. You may call (360) 629- 4030 or 1-800-636-8633 if there is a question or to re- ceive an order form. (A letter with ordering specifics is adequate.) Please order from: CS ENTERPRISES, 3723 Village Road, Stanwood, WA 98292. SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDING COVER DESIGN CONTEST The theme for the MUFON 1996 International UFO Symposium is \"UFOLOGY: A Scientific Enigma.\" We endeavor to depict this theme in the cover artwork. Obviously, this requires considerable ingenuity and something unique in design. The 8 1/2\" x 11\" size will be printed in black on a light pastel color leatherette stock. Since small and intricate details do not print well on a leatherette stock, please take this into consideration in your design. The winning design may also be used on the symposium program in Greensboro, NC. The dead- line for submission is April 15, 1996. The winner will receive an honorarium of $100 cash, plus $100 worth of MUFON publications of your choice. Good luck.

PASSING OF HAROLD HAGLUND John Timmerman called from Ithaca, NY to advise MUFON that our State Section Director for the four- county area, Harold E. Haglund (Ithaca. NY) had passed away during September 1995. Since the UFO phenomenon has been with us for over a half century, we must regretfully accept the fact that we will be los- ing some of the pioneers in this field due to age. In or- der to perpetuate the history of the phenomenon, we in- vite all of our members to seriously consider placing a stipulation in their wills to donate their files and li- braries to the Mutual UFO Network.
