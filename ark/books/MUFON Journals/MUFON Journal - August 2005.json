Schuessler MUFON Research Teams One of MUFON's goals is \"to pro- mote research on UFOs to determine the true nature of the phenomenon, with an eye toward scientific breakthroughs and improving life on our planet.\" The MU- FON Strategic Plan Action No. 2a calls for the creation of five research teams to focus on this goal. The teams are tentatively defined as follows: •History Team: Where are UFOs from, why are they here and who are they? •Travel Team: How do they get here from there? •Energy Team: Where and how do they get their energy? •Abduction Team: Why and how are they abducting people? John Schuessler •Communications Team: How do they communicate? The teams will establish hypotheses aimed at exposing the true nature of the phenomenon. Their reports will then be used to create public awareness, guide future UFO investigations, and focus scien- tific inquiry on the critical issues that result from the team studies. The principal scientist directing the work of the teams is Dr. Robert M. Wood, Physicist, Research Scientist, and MUFON Business Board Mem- ber. We will provide more information as the teams are formed and begin their work.

T he January 2004 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal pre- sented the results of an exten- sive analysis which I did on five sam- plings of material from the new dress Betty Hill wore during her 1961 abduc- tion. This dress had suffered discoloration along the top half of the dress, especially in the underarms, and on the bottom of the dress. Four swaths from the outside of the dress were examined. These included three swaths from dis- colored areas and a control swath from an area that was not discolored. Also analyzed was a swath of the interior lin- ing, which had a stain. It was reported that the three outer discolored dress swaths had suffered chemical attack on both the dye and the fiber. These swaths are coated with a biologically derived material which is mostly protein and a small amount of natural ester type oil. In part, some of these materials had suffered degradation over time (40 years). It was found that these sub- stances are concentrated on the exte- rior surface of the dress, showing their origin was from an external source. The lining stain contains a different protein material and some natural ester, which did not chemically attack the dye or material. It also originated from an external source. All natural bodily sources, which may have originated from Betty, such as urine, perspiration, and vomit, were clearly ruled out. The results led to some speculations. Betty's description of a \"most unpleas- ant\" odor on the craft, along with pres- ence of the protein substance and natu- ral oil, led to the conjecture that the craft occupants' natural body elimination of oils/respiratory agents may have trans- AUGUST 2005 Chemical analyst Phyllis Budinger, standing, and the late Betty Hill examine the dress that Hill wore during the 1961 abduction. ferred to the dress on contact. Also, I did not think the deposited sub- stances on the dress directly caused the discoloration. It was probably from natu- ral biological growth that grew on the area of contact after the abduction. I felt that there was a remote possi- bility that some of the captors' DNA might be on the dress. However, judging from the dress his- tory, I did not know if any intact DNA would remain after this amount of time, especially with the indication of some degraded protein, which suggested that it might have suffered biological attack. But it was worth a shot. DNA analysis was done in the latter half of 2004, and I received a report was on Feb. 22, 2005. This analysis was done on the three discolored, outside swaths and the stained lining. MUFON UFO JOURNAL The biochemists who did this work went the \"extra mile,\" incorporat- ing the most modern techniques to enhance any DNA fragments. They made a project out of it. [This is the same group of scientists who did the DNA analysis of the \"alien hair\" recovered in the Peter Khoury case in Australia, as described in the July issue of the Journal.] I also enlisted the aid of a DNA specialist, Dr. M., to review the report. She does not know the biochemists who did it. Her comments: \"I found the analysis to be pretty good and quite in- formative. They ap- peared to be very care- ful with the DNA extrac- tion process to get all they could from the samples they had to work with.\" I did not tell Dr. M. that the report dealt with a UFO abduction case. If fact, I don't even know if she's inter- ested in the UFO phenomenon, or even knows about the Hill case. On the left sleeve alpha proteobacterium DNA was found. Dr. M. relates: \"These are bacteria that are found in soils and water. The bacteria could be picked up anywhere. If the dress was on the ground, some of the bacteria could have gotten there very easily.\" I found her observation quite interest- ing because, from the location of the bacteria (the left sleeve), if Betty was wearing the dress she would have to be in a prone position-flat on the ground at some point. This is highly unlikely. There is only one time we know the dress was \"on the ground.\" This was"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"when the dress was removed from Betty inside the craft and thrown crumbled on the craft floor. Clearly, some of these bacteria could easily have been from soil/dirt on the floor, brought in on footwear worn by Betty or the escorts. The abduction took place down a dirt road. Following is the DNA sequence profile: Uncultured Alpha Proteobacterium (swathe left sleeve). On the skirt front only a small DNA fragment was isolated, which was not very definitive. The best we can say is the DNA is mammal origin. The frag- ments suggest human, mouse, or bovine. I suspect the fragment is human.The DNA sequence profile follows: Human ribosomal DNA/ Mouse gene for 18S/ Bos taurus external transcribed spacer, partial sequence: 18S (mid-section). On the right sleeve underarm we see human DNA. This is not Betty's. I gave the biochemists a sample of Betty's blood for DNA comparison. However, what was found was DNA from someone of African extract. So we speculate that this is from Barney. Barney may have been escorting Betty at some time during that weekend, leav- ing some of his DNA deposited on the dress. If so, it is most interesting that the DNA was still intact after all of these years. Following is the sequence pro- file. Unknown Human mitochondria! se- quence (right sleeve) Homo sapiens iso- late YYM22 D-loop. partial sequence: mitochondria! TITLE: Genetic Structure of Hmong-Mien Speaking Populations in East Asia as Revealed by mtDNA Lin- eages 1 The DNA analysis of the lining stain identified it as spider blood of the genus coelotes terrestris, which is common to the New Hampshire area, and I suspect southern Canada. There are three such spots on the lin- ing on the back of the dress. So it ap- pears Betty could have sat on a nest of spiders. It's difficult to say when it hap- pened. Kathy Marden, Betty's niece, relates that hours earlier Betty had a hotdog in Swath #1 Swath #3 Canada and sat at a picnic table to eat it. It is a good probability the contact could have occurred there. Otherwise, it could have happened sometime during the event. The DNA sequence profile follows. Coelotes terrestris 18S rRNA gene DNA Analysis Summary The outer discolored areas of the dress have an assortment of DNA fragments. These include bacteria, probably human, which could be from many people han- dling the dress over the years, and prob- ably Barney's DNA. 2 The lining stain is composed of spider blood. Speculations My original speculations regarding the substances coating the discolored areas of the dress remain. I suspect respira- tory agents from the captors. Time had taken its toll on the deposited materials and prevented positve confirmation. It would appear trace remnants of some of the original materials did remain, such as the soil bacteria. This would support Betty's account of the dress being thrown on the craft floor. The event occurred in a rural area on a dirt road. Dirt could have been tracked in by footwear worn by Betty and the craft occupants. And finally we know at some point during the weekend Betty sat on at least three spiders (a nest perhaps). She sat at a picnic table several hours before the MUFON UFO Journal event to eat a hot dog. So it possibly could have happened there. If not, the probability increases that it occurred in an unremembered incident during the event. Clearly the chemical analysis, the DNA analysis, along with the ripped lining and zipper shows some- thing bizarre happened to Betty's new dress on the night of Sept 19,1961. This dress was reduced to a rag as a result! Acknowledgements lam grateful for the help of Bill Chalker for putting me in touch with the biochemists who did the DNA analyses.

Australian motorist startled by strange figure on side of road On June 10, 2005, at 10 AM, Catherine R was driving on a country road on the outskirts of Bundaberg, a port city on Hervey Bay in Australia's state of Queensland, when she saw a strange figure standing in a meadow beside the road. She says, \"While driving in a one- and-a-half-hour drive on a country road through mostly bush-land, I saw through my window a large dark fig- ure about 7 or 8 feet tall. \"It had the appearance of a man, but was far more muscular, with wide shoulders and a torso like a god. It was like nothing I'd ever seen. \"It was dark and scaley-looking. Its color was like ash. Its head was insect- like. I was a scared 22- year-old female. It was just staring at me. I was ex- tremely uncomfortable. \"I was shocked and floored the ac- celerator. It stood still. I was driving at 100 kilometers per hour (60 miles per hour) when I saw it.

Lake degassing? A jet- tisoned airplane tank? These of- ferings were the most prominently discussed possibilities during a two- week period in April and May when a volunteer group of me- teor watchers posted thoughts on their internet forum (meteorobs.org) in response to an intriguing inquiry about a half-cen- tury rold event. We've all grown weary of the haughty Big Science attitude toward the UFO subject. But those principals of academia and industry have reputations to protect, and so are expected to show skepticism. Does that same snooty posturing ex- tend to segments of the citizenry who merely dabble in one aspect or another of the sciences? A 60-year-old woman named Linda had harbored suspicions all her life about the true nature of something she witnessed as a young child. Finally, she decided to write a letter to the American Meteor Society (AMS)-an organization devoted to (1) measuring the intensity of the annual major and minor meteor showers alike, and (2) describing to one another in ex- quisite detail the occasional fireball streaking through the heavens. Linda's email to the AMS was quite out of the ordinary, so it offered outsid- ers a chance to assess how the meteor watchers think on their feet. The text of her message: \"In 1952, when I was 8 years old, my family lived in a house on a hill overlooking Townline Lake in Lake view, MI. I was sitting on the screened porch when I heard a loud splash. \"When I looked up, I saw a large round area of the lake boiling. I was frozen with fascination. The boiling area looked to be perfectly round. It was approximately 50-75 yards from shore (it's hard to judge distance across the water), and the round boiling area was approximately 30-40 feet wide. \"The boiling circle drifted to the left about 20-30 feet from where it had be- gun as if something was drifting down to the bottom of the lake at an angle. After watching it for several minutes, the boiling slowly stopped. \"Would a meteorite cause water to boil like that if it fell into a lake? Would it have cooled off enough to stop the water from boiling in only a few min- utes? Would a meteorite cause the wa- ter to boil in a perfectly round pattern? \"Could a meteorite hitting earth be that large and not cause any destruc- tion if it fell into a lake? I have always wondered what it might have been, and now, 52 years later, I remember the in- cident like it was only yesterday and am still perplexed by the incident.\" Importantly, Linda had not actually seen the object that entered the water, and when she went inside to inform her mother after the boiling stopped, she might have missed any concluding se- quence. But she was clear that a loud splash had first attracted her attention, plus she had offered details on the size and slow movement of the boiling circle over several minutes. Meteor watchers who posted com- ments were in agreement that, what- ever caused the incident, it was not a meteor. Given its likely entry speed in the thousands of miles per hour, a chunk of rock or metal sufficient in size to ef- fect a continuous 30-40 circle of bubbles on the water's surface would undoubtedly have first caused an enor- About the author Dan Wright has been active for a number of years with both Michi- gan MUFON and MUFON interna- tional. He conducted a five-year study of abductions, indexing more than 250 verbatim accounts submitted by 20 researchers. Wright was a 15-year Board member for MUFON, and served as deputy director for investigations for MUFON for seven years, grading more than 1,000 reports, establish- ing review procedures, and assist- ing in creating the Worldwide UFO Databse. He authored three chapters of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual, has written numerous ar- ticles, and has spoken at several MUFON symposiums. mous sonic boom, followed by wide- spread destruction from the impact. As one member put it, \"If such a bolide came in, a huge end-of-the- world, thundering-smashing sound would definitely have been more memorable than the bubbling lake, caused by the more distant mass entering with cosmic velocity.\" Ignorant of the reported characteris- tics of discoid crafts entering bodies of water over the years-or that 1952 was huge in terms of UFO activity across America-no one in the group even con- sidered the possibility of a structured craft from beyond Earth as the culprit. Instead, what they did come up with as possibilities ranged from the plau- sible to the amusing. A sampling of their remarks: \"My highly uneducated guess would be that what (the woman) witnessed was an instance of lake degassing, wherein buildup of methane (a byproduct of the decomposition of or- ganic matter) and/or CO2 reaches a certain pressure point, allowing the gas(es) to be spontaneously released en MUFON UFO Journal August 2005"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"masse from lake-bottom sediment. Such an event occurred on a much larger scale in 1986 on Cameroon's Lake Nyos, killing over 1700 people.\". This hypothesis (a lake version of swamp gas) ignores the loud splash that first drew the girl's attention. A second meteorobs posting agreed with the notion of carbon dioxide buildup: \"I believe the CO2 is in solu- tion much like the CO2 within a soda bottle before opening. After the pres- sure is released, the CO2 gas bubbles rush to the surface. Whatever hap- pened, it surely doesn't sound like a meteorite is at the root.\" The degassing idea, however, did have one detractor: \"Just wanted to sign in for a moment to say I agree that it is extremely unlikely to be a meteor. However, I don't think it's CO2 gas, either. There would have to be a source of CO2 gas (usually volcanic), and the lake would have to be deep enough to 'cork' the bottle with hydrostatic weight.\" Enter the fish, compliments of a fourth meteor enthusiast: \"Another theory is that she saw a fish fingerling school escaping from a predator. I have seen it and it looks and moves like she described. It is also transient in that many fish don't school when larger and really small fish stay in the shallows.\" This hypothesis requires that the girl misidentified the water's roiling action from flapping fins for the bubbles she insists were seen. And finally the inconsiderate pilot notion: \"For what it is worth, in the 50s the Air Force pilots under certain flight situations jettisoned belly tanks-empty or otherwise-on what seemed to be a regular basis. When possible they were to be dropped over water. Sometimes accidentally.\" At this point the intrepid UFO re- searcher entered the fray. In pertinent part, my posting read: \"There is another possibility, which in this case might be more plausible than anything derived from the annals of weird science. The year 1952 happened to include dramatic and persistent ap- pearances of UFOs. \"Numerous military documents, since acquired via the Freedom of In- formation Act, reported pilot chases, uncorrelated radar targets, and repeated intrusions of airspace around the nation's Capitol.... \"FYI, scores of eyewitnesses over the years are on record as having ob- served metallic disc-type vehicles en- tering lakes and ocean water, many of whom further described a bubbling on the surface presumably related to heat generated by the saucer's exterior. Many of those persons further wit- nessed the reappearance of the disc as it emerged from underwater and flew out of sight.\" The next day brought some inevi- table derision, borrowed from the 18 th century British philosopher David Hume: \"That no testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the testi- mony be of such a kind that its false- hood would be more miraculous than the fact which it endeavors to estab- lish.\" Gosh, I felt really put in my place. Fortunately, the witness herself came to. my rescue. In a follow-up letter, Linda wrote: \"I want to thank everyone very much for their speculations as to what I may have witnessed on Townline Lake in 1952. While the lake was stocked with bluegill and bass, I don't think it was a school of fish, as it would have been too far away from shore for the smaller fish to school together. \"I have done a great deal of fishing in my life, and have seen many schools of fish being chased by predators, and it did not look the same. And even though fish cause some splashing when they are being chased, the splash I heard in 1952 was very loud. Much louder than a school of small fish make when fleeing a predator. \"The methane gas or even the UFO theories seem more plausible to me, al- though I doubt if the methane gas would have caused a loud splashing noise. Perhaps a loud bubbling noise. \"I am glad to know that everyone ruled out the meteorite theory, however, since that is what I always thought it was, and this information rules out that possibility. \"I was unaware of the large number of sightings of UFOs in 1952, and do not positively rule out that theory, since my husband and I saw a UFO in Indi- ana in 1981.\" She went on to say that, as volun- teer firefighters, they were monitoring the Indianapolis air traffic control tower when they heard pilots describing an unknown 35 miles south of the city- near the couple's home. They drove to a hill outside their town where they spotted the object hov- ering at 3,000 feet. Linda reports: \"It was round, silver, and had red and green lights scrolling around its middle. The lights moved from right to left. It moved very slowly across the sky from east to west. Much slower than an airplane could move and still remain airborne. \"We watched it for at least 30 min- utes while other airline pilots heading toward Indianapolis reported the same unidentified object to the control tower. Finally, the object flew straight up and out of sight within a matter of sec- onds.\" Unfortunately from an investigative standpoint, Linda offered no date in her summaries for either the 1952 or 1981 event, and her email address has been protected by the meteorobs.org webmaster. Still, that second install- ment offered a measure of vindication. As important, perhaps a few more widemeteor watchers now believe in miracles.

Olsen, M.S. Retired Nuclear Engineer (UK) Abstract: Odor descriptions in 16 close-encounter reports are summa- rized and attributed to low-temperature oxidation products of three hydrocar- bon fuels. NO^ 0 4 from atmospheric nitrogen fixation is discussed as another odor- ant. Odors are usually not experienced in UFO sightings, since the object must be nearby, and the witness must be within the downwind dispersion plume. Even in close encounters with disc UFOs, only about one out of three cases includes perception of odors. Witnesses generally report an unfa- miliar, nauseating, pervasive and op- pressive smell, pungently irritating to the mucosal tissues of eyes, nose, and throat. Depending on the magnitude of in- tegrated exposure, immediate effects may include dizziness, upset stomach, and vomiting. The odor may still be noticeable hours later, from the lungs and on the skin, which may peel. Severe exposures may be followed by temporary loss of appetite and low blood lymphocyte count, and may necessitate hospitaliza- tion. 1 In a representative selection of 52 close encounters with disc UFOs, in- cluding the 16 with odor which are noted explicitly here, and 36 others without odor, 2 there is no significant sta- tistical correlation between occurrence of odor and most other common fea- tures-including sounds, smoke, haze or mist, colored glow, electromagnetic ef- fects, or sighting duration. Duration is evidently statistically in- significant, as witnesses in several brief encounters noted immediate visibility of copious vapor emissions, to which they attributed the reported odor. 3 Witnesses close to the UFO are sta- tistically somewhat more likely to sense any odors emitted by the UFO. 4 8 In some of the CEII cases, odor at the landing site is not detected until the ground traces are inspected immedi- ately after the sighting. The relative wind direction is unfor- tunately not stated in most UFO reports, and may be responsible for the appar- ent absence of odors in the majority of close encounters. In four of the 16 sightings with odor, the witnesses did note a distinct hiss- ing sound. This was not heard in any of the 36 typical close encounters with- out odor. A provisional explanation for the odor evolves from literal interpretation of the specific odor descriptions, as summarized in Table 1, and from con- sideration of reported electromagnetic effects of UFOs. 15 Thus, with the exception of ozone, . which sometimes is misinterpreted as burning sulphur, the specific odors re- ported appear to be from oxidation products of hydrocarbons: methyl al- cohol, methyl benzene, and benzene. Evidently these are somehow avail- able in the UFO's vicinity, perhaps through venting or incomplete combus- tion. It is significant that they are not pe- troleum derivatives; methyl alcohol is made from wood, while the two ben- zenes are obtained from coal. On this planet, at least, these sources are more likely to be available in later stages of technological development than petroleum. The reported electromagnetic phe- nomena from UFOs are sufficient to produce the necessary oxidizing agents in the immediate vicinity. Thus, ozone is expected in a region ionized by static electric and magnetic fields, and by microwave and optically visible elec- tromagnetic energy. Moreover, the characteristic yellow afterglow of active nitrogen, 16 visible in spite of the quenching effect of oxygen in the air, 17 is described by some wit- nesses. 18 The active nitrogen fixes oxygen to MUFON UFO Journal produce NO (unstable), NO (oxidizes to NO 2 ), N 2 0 3 (also unstable), NO 2 and N 2 0 5 . The latter oxide is a white, crystal- line solid below 30 degrees C (86 de- grees F). Thus, only NO 2 is considered here, in addition to ozone, as an effec- tive oxidizing agent. The fact that N 2 0 4 is used as a fuel oxidizer in contemporary rocket tech- nology is ignored in the UFO context since, as discussed above, the oxidiz- ing agent appears to be produced out- side of the UFO as an unavoidable con- sequence of the electromagnetic field. In summary, considering the re- ported characteristics, UFO odors are attributed to externally produced oxi- dizing agents, ozone and NO^^, and their reaction with methyl alcohol, me- thyl benzene, and benzene: While it may be difficult to accept the implica- tion that hydrocarbons are used as an energy source in disc UFOs, and waste- fully too, the reported descriptions of occasional black smoke emission from disc UFOs must be recognized as fur- ther evidence. 22 Propulsion using the implied hydro- carbon fuels presumably requires atmo- spheric oxygen for primary combus- tion. This assumption tends to support \"mother ship\" reports, suggesting the more common, disc-type UFOs cannot operate outside Earth's atmosphere. Notes and References 1.

I was frightened. For one, I am female and was traveling alone, and I was in the middle of nowhere. \"I thought that the reason for the power giving out in my car was because my brother had been using my car bat- tery earlier in the day and may not have tightened the battery cables properly. \"I didn't have a flashlight on me and I grabbed my cell phone to let someone know what had happened. Then I decided to get out of the car, knowing that my cell phone had a bright light on it, and I was going to check the battery cables. \"Before I could open my cell phone to turn it on, a bright bluish glow started to light up a wooded area across the highway from me. \"At first I thought it was another ve- hicle coming up behind me, and I pan- icked for a moment because my car had stopped on top of the hill on a curve, and, if the vehicle was coming up the curve too fast, it would hit me. \"But I realized quickly that it was not another vehicle. I couldn't quite identify the light, but the woods got suddenly brighter. The light went bright like a blue-white light bulb. \"It was more like the light from a giant blue flashlight or helicopter (search) light. I sat in complete silence while I watched it slowly move up out of the trees until it was above the trees and clearly in the sky with the stars for a background. \"It was a huge bluish translucent ball of light, with the center of the ball much darker than the outer edges.The outer edges of the ball seemed to vibrate or tremble slightly. 10 \"It continuously rose up into the sky, at first slowly, but, the higher it got, the faster it went.

Large glowing object reported in Tennessee On March 17, 2004, a 42-year-old man (name on file) says he was walk- ing on the bank of South Holson Lake in Sullivan County, TN, looking for old fishing plugs, when he glanced up about 6:20 PM and saw a stationary glowing object which was perfectly circular. It was about the size of a basketball at arm's length, and he estimates the object was 100 to 500 feet away. Other than a bright yellow glow, there were no distinguishing features, and it was not translucent. He observed the object for about two minutes be- fore it shot straight up into the sky and was gone. The witness is a retired veteran of military special forces.

MUFON UFO Journal computer hacker looking for ET and 9-11 coverup now facing extradition A 39-year-old unemployed UFO en- thusiast has been accused of commit- ting the biggest military computer hack of all time by the US government, while authorities in Britain chose to release the North Londoner without charge. His interest in the systems was sparked, as it was for many others, by an interest in science, science fiction, and the unknown. It was the search for proof of extra- terrestrial life and a potential cover-up around the events of 11 September, 2001, that led him to the restricted gov- ernment sites. He was, metaphorically speaking, able to walk right in, look around, and make himself at home in what are sup- posedly some of the most secure sys- tems in the world. Although breaking into the Depart- ment of Defense (DoD) required a combination of ingenuity and hours of mindless drudgery, ultimately it was the \"dangerously lax IT systems\" that made it possible, he claims. And as for the \"minor\" damage to the systems concerned, it was not de- liberate, he says, but happened acciden- tally while he was trying to cover his tracks. Gary McKinnon has a lot to worry about. His job prospects are bleak. He will shortly have to leave his home in North London, and could be facing up to 70 years in a US federal prison-a prospect that terrifies him. His actions have been well recorded. Over a period of years he managed to bypass the security of what should be the most sophisticated IT systems on the planet, many of which belong to the US DoD and NASA. That was back in 2002, and he has already been investigated thoroughly by the legal authorities in the UK and re- leased without charge. But the slow-working cogs of the US legal system have finally clicked into action, leaving him hanging in limbo awaiting an extradition hearing.

Dolan One certainly hears a lot these days about \"American fascism.\" Certain commentators like to point out that fas- cism was a distinct historical develop- ment that evolved from the European wreckage after World War One. Some main- tain that to call what is happen- ing in America \"fascism\" is a disservice to those who lived under Hitler, Mussolini, or other dictators. It's true that there are major differ- ences here today with certain features of those regimes. There has been no openly acknowledged coup d'etat to which one can refer. But the changes to America have yet been profound. I believe that the Jacobin-styled revo- lutionaries who run America these days have learned an important lesson from the past: that the best revolutions are silent. Manage the media, manage the other major institutions of power, and you can have your way about almost anything. You can change the structure of soci- ety at the most profound levels, as long as you keep the old appearances. I call this invisible fascism. But my main quarry for this paper is not empire, not the covert influence of big money, not globalization, not the co- option of what was once an indepen- dent media, nor even fascism per se in America. There is another disease eating away at America. It is something which re- ceives nearly no attention, even from those people who think and care about such quaint issues as republican virtue and freedom. That is that matter commonly re- ferred to as UFOs and the cancerous AUGUST 2005 Editor's Note The initial portion of this article originally discussed in some detail Dolan's concerns with what he feels is a move toward \"American fas- cism\" and various activities of the government, such as the Patriot Act and the activities of the government related to 9-11. As this was not directly related to UFOs, most of this material was, with the author's permission, not in- cluded in the current edited article.

Of science and politics The development of invisible fas- cism in America is of such historical significance, you might ask, \"why talk about UFOs?\" There is no shortage of culprits, so why bring in the lunatic fringe? Conversely, there are also UFO re- searchers who want no part of political analysis interfering with their field of study. This is a scientific issue, they maintain. Introducing political perspec- tives just muddies the waters. Analyze the evidence, know your facts, and stay objective. But the UFO topic has important political implications. We cannot afford to ignore them. One of these is the dam- aging effect UFO secrecy has had on our society. It is an issue that intimately affects public policy, national security, and our very freedom. Indeed, as I will argue, the topic of UFOs and the extreme secrecy con- cerning them will determine a signifi- cant course of our civilization's future. Reality of UFO phenomenon UFOs are not fun and games, they are not delusions. They are real. The phenomenon has involved real technol- ogy, doing real things that are not sup- posed to be possible. MUFON UFO JOURNAL About the Author Richard Dolan is the author of UFOs and the National Security State (2000), which covers the period from 1941 to 1973. He is currently completing the second volume, 1974 to the present. Dolan did undergraduate work at Alfred University in history, English, and philosophy, earned a scholarship to Oxford, and did graduate work at the University of Rochester in political sci- ence. He has spoken at several UFO conferences, including MUFON's 2002 and 2005 symposiums. This technology, since at least World War Two, has engaged in a confronta- tional and provocative manner with U.S. military forces on many occasions. It has involved both air space viola- tions and alarmed responses, and has elicited the concern of some of the high- est ranking military and intelligence of- ficers in the country. We know this because, for a rela- tively brief period in America's history (primarily the late 1970s and into some of the 1980s), the Freedom of Infor- mation Act enabled researchers to ob- tain official documents from govern- ment agencies which clearly demon- strated this. Not that FOIA is officially dead to- day, but it has had its ups and downs over the years. As far as obtaining UFO-related information, FOIA's mo- ment of glory was long ago, in the post- Watergate and post-Vietnam era. Thus, agencies such as the CIA, DIA, FBI, and pick your alphabet-soup agency, which for years had steadfastly denied having anything to do with UFOs, suddenly released thousands of pages of documentation proving the op- posite. It is true that, among these officially released documents, there is no abso- lute smoking gun-e.g. a memo from the President stating \"Okay, what do we do about these pesky aliens, anyhoo?\" There are, however, quite a few documents that are one cut below this. 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"That is, documents that describe utterly awesome military encounters with the unexplainable. Taken individually, such FOIA docu- ments do not prove the existence of UFOs as something \"not us.\" After all, even military witnesses can make mis- takes. Radar can be faulty or misinter- preted. But, taken as a whole, the released FOIA documents provide a large body of evidence relating to serious military encounters with UFOs. After you read the first fifty of these, you start to won- der. Let's review a couple of these documents. The 1949 Kirtland document We have, for instance, a document from Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico from Jan. 31, 1949, directed to the USAF Chief of Staff. There was a flurry of UFO activity going on in New Mexico at this time. The document in question described yet another of these sightings from the pre- vious day, seen by about 30 people. The document states: \"Estimate at least 100 total sightings. AEC, AFSWP, 4th Army, local com- manders perturbed by implications of phenomena.... All appear to be same object at different points in trajectory. Unless instructed to contrary this of- fice will make all out investigation with view to location of impact point if any.\" All those agencies were \"perturbed by implications of phenomena.\" Yes, indeed. I would be perturbed, too. On the same day that the Kirtland document was issued, Strategic Air Command sent a memo to FBI Direc- tor J. Edgar Hoover. It stated that the matter of UFOs was \"considered top secret by Intelligence Officers of both the Army and the Air Forces.\" A 1950 Confidential Memorandum with the heading, \"Flying Disks.\" This memo is remarkable, and I want to separate each sentence from one para- graph, so that you read it carefully: The 1950 Hanford document. \"Since 30 July objects, round in form, have been sighted over the Hanford AEC Plant. \"These objects reportedly were above 15,000 feet in altitude. \"Air Force jets attempted intercep- tion with negative results. \"All units including the anti-aircraft battalion, radar units, Air Force fighter squadrons, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have been alerted for fur- ther observation. \"The Atomic Energy Commission states that the investigation is continu- ing and complete details will be for- warded later.\" Where oh where are the academic historians regarding this memo? Failed intercepts? Anti-aircraft battalions? Good lord. And whatever happened to the AEC investigation and report? The answer to that last question might be contained in the wording of the 1949 memo sent to Hoover. It stated that the matter of UFOs was \"consid- ered top secret.\" Yet, of the thousands of UFO-related documents that were released through the Freedom of Information Act, only the smallest handful of (highly cen- sored) documents were actually Top Secret. The rest were typically classified Re- stricted or Confidential, or at most Se- cret. Lower levels of secrecy, in other words. So where are the Top Secret documents? Despite the best efforts of FOIA re- searchers, the best reports and intelli- gence remain far removed from the public domain. Despite what some people had hoped, the FOIA has not turned out to be a magic bullet. It is also fairly obvious that UFO secrecy involves classifications higher than Top Secret. Higher classifications are themselves classified, so who knows how far they really go. James Bamford in Body of Secrets, a study of the NSA, writes, \"like an endless spiral, there are secret classifi- cation systems within secret classifica- tion systems.\" What we do know is that Canadian government official Wilbert Smith wrote in 1950 that he had made \"dis- creet enquiries through the Canadian embassy staff in Washington\" and learned that the subject of UFOs was \"the most highly classified subject in the United States government.\" Robins Air Force Base The last of the early memos I want to show you is from Robins Air Force Wilbert Smith Base in Macon, GA, dated July 9,1951. It describes a ten-minute aerial UFO encounter that took place in the early afternoon. The pilot, a first lieutenant, was fly- ing an F-51 on a routine flight from Lawson AFB in Columbus, GA. Not far from Augusta, he encountered an object that was \"flat on top and bottom and appearing from a front view to have rounded edges and slightly beveled.\" At one point the object dived while in front of the pilot's view. When it did so, it appeared \"completely round and spinning in a clockwise direction.\" The amount of detail on this report is remarkable. It continues: \"From front view as object dived observer noted small spots on the object ...Object did not appear to be aluminum. Only 1 ob- ject observed. Solar white. No vapor trails or exhaust or visible system of propulsion. Described as traveling at tremendous speed.\" The object eventually \"disappeared under his plane.\" Not only was this for an extended duration, but the pilot got to within 300 to 400 feet of the object. He estimated its size at about 10 to 15 feet in diam- eter. This object was moving very fast. According to the report, the pilot thought the object was moving at the speed of a jet. He felt a \"disturbance in the air described as a bump when ob- ject passed under plane.... Pilot flew in combat in Europe for 12 months 1944- 1945. Pilot considered by associates to be highly reliable, of mature judgement and a creditable observer.\" There are other documents like this. 12 MUFON UFO Journal August 2005"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"i- Taken as a group, they establish that, during this early period at least, there were quite a few events that were re- corded and classified by U.S. military and intelligence personnel that they took seriously. It is easy to understand why. Soviet? American? Other? Were these objects of Soviet origin, developed perhaps with the aid of cap- tured German scientists-some of whom were indeed experimenting with disk- shaped platforms? This possibility was investigated, and rejected. Today, years later, there is still no evi- dence that the Soviets invented \"flying saucers\" after World War Two. What about the Americans? They captured their own cache of German scientists, after all. One can speculate on the possibility that some break- through was made in the immediate post-World War Two years, in deep secrecy, as a result of purely terrestrial science. But there are several problems with this theory, as well. First, the documen- tation that we have indicates serious efforts on anti-gravity commencing in the mid-1950s. If anything started sooner within the United States, we have no documen- tary evidence. That is not to say it didn't happen, but there are no documents to show it. Nor would it seem logical that this was a deep black American program, at least when viewing the confronta- tional nature of some of these encoun- ters. The 1951 pilot encounter cited above, for instance, or the many intru- sions over military bases and research centers, don't make sense as a secret American project, at least not on the face of it. Unless, of course, you speculate that a rogue human group obtained radically advanced technology; a group beyond the control of official militaries and governments. I can't prove this, but is it possible? Of course. That, frankly, seems to be the con- servative interpretation, and it's not exactly conservative. Then there is the more radical interpretation, which is that this technology wasn't human in origin at all. (Continued next month.) AUGUST 2005 MUFON Forum Witness revealed Editor's Note: The \"Cisco Grove Bow & Arrow case\" was summarized in the April MUFON UFO Journal in an article by Preston Dennett.from his book UFOs Over California. There was discussion in the Forum in the June issue of the name of the main witness. Dennett's full report of the in- cident, as it appears in his book, fol- lows this letter to the Forum by the wit- ness' wife: Dear Mr. Connelly, I have the answer to the name dis- cussion by Mr. Dennett, Mr. Heiden, and Mr. Good printed in the MUFON Forum, page 10, of the MUFON UFO Journal of June, 2005. The witness in the Cisco Grove Bow and Arrow case of 1964 is my husband of 42 years, Donald R. Shrum. He fought them off all night and got away. Don is 67 years old now, and is in good health and retired. Paul Cerny was Don's MUFON investigator in 1964. KathylynBunyard told of of Paul's passing. We have the greatest respect for Paul. He treated Don very well, and always kept us in- formed about Don's case. Paul and Don agreed to keep Don's last name confidential because of the prevailing attitudes in the early 60's. Paul used Mr. S and Donald S. Don was introduced to Stanton Friedman, though, as Mr. X by Paul in the 70's in Sacramento, CA. Later on, Paul used Donald Smythe. Richard Hall never had our permis- sion to use Don's last name. Mr. Hall was so very close: he added the letter c to Don's last name. We have never met Mr. Hall. Don's name was leaked by whom we will never know. Paul; Dr. Anita Brothers of Berkeley, CA; Professor Killick; James Harder; and U.S. Air Force Capt. McCloud and a sergeant who were with Intelligence Command (who grilled Don off base for serveral hours; I was present then) were the only ones we knew who had Don's full name, address, and possibly phone MUFON UFO JOURNAL number. Nevertheless, his leaked name, etc. did cause some problems, not too bad. -Warmest regards, Mrs. Judith Shrum Following is the case as described in UFOs Over California: On Labor Day weekend in 1964, a now classic UFO case took place in the wilderness outside Cisco Grove, near Truckee, California. Three hunters were using the long weekend to do some bow-and-arrow hunting. On Sep- tember 4, the three men separated from each other and began the hunt. One of the hunters, Donald Smythe, had no idea that he was about to be- come the hunted. After a long day of hunting, Smythe had become lost and was having trouble finding his way back to camp. When he saw a light darting back and forth above him, he assumed a helicopter had been sent to rescue him. Instead, the object came overhead and hovered silently above him. When the object suddenly landed, Smythe realized that it was something outside of his experience. He became fright- ened and climbed up a nearby tree. Smythe then saw three figures exit the craft and come towards him. Two of the figures were about five feet tall and dressed from head to toe in silvery- gray material. The third figure appeared to be robotic, with two reddish-orange \"eyes\" and a rectangular opening for a mouth. The three figures approached the tree and appeared to try and climb it. The robotic figure opened its rectangular: mouth and belched out clouds of foul- smelling gas which made Smythe choke and lose consciousness. He climbed further up into the tree as the three figures continued to taunt him. The three figures stayed for hours, despite Smythe's attempts to dissuade them by dropping burning bits of pa- per and clothing. He then shot at the robot with his arrows. Although the robot was knocked down, the arrows bounced off the metallic surface. This went on all night. When dawn 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"broke, the figures were still there. Sud- denly, a fourth figure exited the craft and Smythe saw that it was another robotic figure, identical to the fust. The two robots emitted a huge cloud of smoke which enveloped Smythe, caus- ing him to lose consciousness. When he awoke, the figures and \"dome- shaped\" craft were gone. Smythe hurriedly returned to camp, where he found his friends looking for him. Upon hearing his account, one of the hunters reported that he also saw a \"bright, glowing, large light\" swoop down and travel at low altitude across the sky. Both companions also re- marked that the incident undoubtedly had something to do with the fact that the government was already hi the area looking for a \"meteorite.\" Smythe's wife saw him after the incident and provided additional details: \"I knew something was wrong with him when I saw him. He was as white as a sheet, and his eyes were dazed look- ing. He spoke to me in a very shaky voice. He had dark circles under his eyes. He looked terrible...he had scratches all over his arms. He came in and didn't even say hi, hello or anything... .he then proceeded to tell me about his Cisco Grove experience. His hands shook and his voice was subdued... .he was on the verge of crying [and] was so badly shaken that he took a week off from work.\" Smythe was badly traumatized by the incident and reported it to the Air Force. While the Air Force suggested he was perhaps the victim of a prank, pioneering UFO investigator Coral Lorenzen calls the case \"the most spec- tacular report I have ever examined,\" and believes \"it is an authentic incident and important to the documentation of 'occupant' incidents.\" UFO investigators Ted Bloecher and Paul Cerny also conducted an in-depth, onsite investigation and came away to- tally convinced. Writes Cerny, \"Having just reviewed the case files on this fascinating and unusual encounter, there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that this incident is factual and authentic. I have spent considerable time and many visits with the main witness, and along with the testimony of the other witnesses, I can rule out the possibility of any hoax.\" Cracks in the Great Wall-UFOs and Traditional Metaphysics by Charles Upton, 2005, Sophia Perennis, Light- ning Source, LaVergne, TN, ISBN 1- 59731-024-7,88 pages, soft cover, 6x9, No index. $18.95. Reviewed by Dwight Connelly The author purports to explain what UFOs are by using a combination of science and metaphysics, utilizing pri- marily the views of ufologist Jacques Vallee and metaphysicist Rene Guenon. Vallee is, in fact, the only ufologist in which the author seems to place much faith, and it is clear that Upton has only limited knowledge of ufology. Still, the writing is clear and intelli- gent for the most part as he presents material to convince the reader that UFOs are manifestations of the anti- Christ. \"I consider,\" says the author, \"the contemporary UFO experience, and particularly the occurrence of 'alien ab- duction,' to be the most direct mani- festation conceivable of these powers of darkness-a manifestation which has become possible on such a widespread basis only because the present world- age is rapidly drawing to a close: it is truly an 'end time' phenomenon.\" Although Upton seems unable to dif- ferentiate between New Age groups, such as Heaven's Gate, and groups such as MUFON, he does spend sev- eral pages critiquing the late John Mack's approach to both the abductees and the abductors. The author concludes that the UFO entities are members of the Jinn of the Koran-beings inhabiting a plane sub- tler than the Material, but grosser than the Imaginal and Angelic: the seventh plane in the Great Chain of Being.\" He says that not all Jinn are evil, \"but the Jinn who are staging the present UFO manifestations almost certainly are demons,\" and \"are here to prepare us for the religion of the antichrist.\" He adds, \"If today's alien shows many similarities to the traditional 'vampire,' it is because both of them steal our 'blood,' our life-energy, which in the most fundamental sense is noth- ing other than the spiritual attention we owe to God as the source of our life.\" He adds, \"Just as an adultrous affair destroys marriage by diverting erotic energy, so the 'alien' and the 'entity' destroy our relationship to God by di- verting spiritual energy.\" The author says he will accept, \"without apology, the existence of in- visible worlds, and the ability of such worlds to impinge upon and alter the physical one.\" Overlooking few issues, Upton also spends some time explaining why he believes reincarnation and time travel are impossible. He says that the UFOs cannot be interplanetary spaceships because, based on Vallee's conclusions, \"there are simply too many of them; it is not likely, for example, that the possibly two million Americans who have been abducted by aliens were kidnapped by astronauts.\" The author quotes Orthodoxy and the Religion of the Future that \"the manifestations of today's flying saucers are quite within the 'technology' of de- mons; indeed, nothing else can explain them as well. The multifarious demonic deceptions of Orthodox literature have been adapted to the mythology of outer space, nothing more..[their] purpose is to awe the beholders with a sense of the 'mysterious,' and to produce 'proof of the 'higher intelligences' ('angels,' if the victim believes in them, or 'space visitors' for modern men), and thereby gain trust for the message they wish to communicate.\" This book probably won't change many minds, but Upton does a reason- ably good job of presenting his view of ufology: \"a true postmodern demonol- ogy-though all too many of those who believe that Unidentified Flying Objects are extraterrestrial visitors treat it more as a post-modern religion.\" 14 MUFON UFO Journal August 2005"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"1 I I T\" HJUjy Director, MUFON Eastern Region Note: These reports are presented in or- der to keep readers informed of some of the vast number of sightings being reported.

The witness states, 'Twenty minutes after takeoff a horseshoe crab-shaped silver object was quickly overtaken by our aircraft at 8:14 PM. \"The crab-shaped UFO was flying at our altitude and not recognized as an air- craft. We estimated the object was at a 1/4 mile distance from our AA 757, but it was definitely not a plane, and seemed to be hanging almost vertically north of us.\" On landing at Manchester, England, they asked the pilot and co-pilot about the UFO. They did not see it or pick anything up on radar. Thanks to Peter Davenport, Director, www.ufocenter.com. UK cigar COVENTRY - On June 17,2005, at 2:10 AM, a train engineer and another railway worker witnessed a multi-col- ored cigar-shaped object low in the sky. The engineer at Coventry Station was driving locomotive 66537 (4006). The engineer reports, \"About half a mile before Cov station I noticed at about a 35-degree angle from eyesight a large green light above Coventry City Centre. It appeared to be stationary and was a steady light. \"Getting closer to the station, the light turned to a steady red or slightly orange glow. I couldn't remain in permanent focus with the object because I was run- ning on to a red signal. \"I observed that the light had a tube- like shape and a red light at the rear. I AUGUST 2005 would guess that it was only about a couple of hundred feet in the sky, and was moving northeast over Coventry. \"There was no noise I could hear, but then again I was in a 66 locomotive. Also there was a rail grinding machine on the down slow platform, and the driver of that was on the platform watching the UFO. \"Maybe it was a barrage balloon or Zeppelin type craft? But why the steady light not flashing, plus I have never seen these at night, and also it appeared to be thin and tube George Filer like .\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Disc attacks Stealth bomber? INDIANAPOLIS - Two witnesses decided to walk around the outside of the Indy 500 Race Track. They were walking south on Georgetown Road on the left side of the street on May 29,2005, at 11:30 PM, and overheard people say the Stealth was almost there and pointed it out. The witness reports, \"Soon, we saw the Stealth bomber coming straight over Georgetown Road, and nearby there was a disc moving like a chrome ringing bell, then hovering in one spot, bunding simi- lar to the sun shining on chrome. \"The thing was high, higher then the Stealth, and the disc seemed to be wait- ing for the Stealth. As the Stealth flew under the hovering disc, the disc seemed to attack the Stealth bomber. \"The disc stopped glistening, and smoked a little as it hit the right wing of the Stealth plane, then started shining again. The plane circled the track one lap and went west in the direction of the MUFON UFO JOURNAL Indianapolis Airport. \"The right wing had some smoke com- ing from it. Maybe that's normal, but the first 12 seconds were something to see. After I saw the smoke from the wing of the Stealth, I couldn't spot the disc. \"There were a couple of witnesses leaving for the race. The female looked at the disc or bell and said, 'Cool.'\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Possible new Roswell info Dave writes: \"I wanted to relate a story to you about my father, Joe, who was on the Civil Engineering faculty at the University of Texas. \"In mid-July of 1947, my parents were driving late at night, westbound from Clovis, NM, trying to make Santa Fe. My Mother said that west of Clovis about 15 miles the road was open with no traffic. It was a clear starry night \"She said the road was 'mounded' up, built up higher than the surrounding ter- rain. There was (and is) a railroad track that parallels the road, but located down below, and that its telegraph poles reached only slightly higher than the road surface. \"This stretch of road is about 40 miles northeast of Roswell, N.M. Today, as then, the road is still built up and, while there are more utility poles, mere are still long sections where the road is about the height of the tops of the poles. \"If you are westbound, to the left is a long, descending plain that runs almost to Roswell, devoid of trees, power line, and any other obstructions. As many places in the West, you can literally see 25 to 30 miles. \"Suddenly Dad slammed on the brakes, a very hard setdown with smoke and boiling, screaming tires. As they sat there, in front of them about 150 feet, was a huge craft which had come up from the plains on the left, out of the dark- 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"ness, and was skimming south to north across the road surface, not touching the road, but about two feet above it. \"The wind draft of this object was pulling some dust and straw along with it. Mom said they could not see the top of the object until it passed, but that it filled the windshield view and rose out of sight vertically. \"She said that it looked like an express passenger train, racing across a grade level crossing right in front of them. However, it was no train, it was huge with 'lighted' windows and some dark- ened windows, racing by, giving a pas- senger train effect of train windows go- ing by. \"However, think of trains stacked on top of each other so high that it fills the windshield until out of sight. It was mov- ing somewhat faster than any express train she had ever seen, maybe 130 MPH, yet was so big it took some time to pass. \"Obviously, Dad had seen it coming at the last minute up out of the dark plains on the left, They both said that it had come 'from below' on the left to just skim the road top. Dad said it would have hit them had he not seen 'movement in the dark off to the left.' \"Both parents stressed that this 'was not a train,' no head lights. After it passed they looked for a track in the road, cross- ing signs, or any other evidence of rail. There was nothing. \"They did say the asphalt was hot, al- most steaming, but there were no marks or anything. And definitely no railroad tracks. \"They also said it certainly wasn't a train, as it was huge-the size and height of the University of Texas Memorial Sta- dium. \"Both my parents were college edu- cated and intelligent. They both were religious and very skeptical of new things, of technology. So I am convinced that 'something' was seen there. It was af- ter the Roswell incident by only days when my parents got 'buzzed.'\" Thanks to Dave. North Carolina UFO BELMONT - A Navy veteran and project manager with a mechanical en- gineering firm was driving home on Southpoint Road on May 28, 2005, at 11:15 PM, parallel to Lake Wylie, when his wife observed an object flying in a strange manner. He reports, \"My wife snatched my arm and pointed to the object. I was in total awe, as the object was only a half mile from us and flying over Lake Wylie at 1,000 feet or less. \"We slowed down and were moving at a snail's pace on the road to observe this phenomenon. The object stopped, appeared to hover, and then performed a swift 90-degree turn and was heading in our direction towards the steam plant. \"The Charlotte International Airport is very close by, but we were nowhere close to its flight paths. We kept driving, but the object turned west. We then turned our vehicle around and went back to the original spot where we had viewed the object. \"When we arrived, the object was back in its original position. The craft took a southerly course and flew over Gaither Road towards the other side of Lake Wylie. The craft made no sound and had a dull yellow glow on the bot- tom. The three lights were dull, also, but a tad brighter. \"When the craft pulled away, it kept at a very slow pace and was very close to us. The other witnesses were our kids (seven, five and two). The children ob- served this craft and were visibly/emo- tionally disturbed by it. This was truly amazing!!\" Colorado sighting by Mackay DENVER - \"Greetings from Glennys Mackay, National Director MUFON Brisbane, Australia. I thought it is fitting to report a first-hand sighting on June 8, 2005, while visiting friends living up on Blue Mountain overlooking Golden, CO. \"At 7:15 PM, I was standing on the balcony admiring the view when we were attracted to what we thought at first to be a very large bird flying from west to east. \"I commented to my friend John Tracey (also visiting from Brisbane, Aus- tralia), 'What a huge bird,' when it passed the tall Ponderosa pines, it was in clear vision. \"This object was flashing a blue light, and on turning towards us was silver and round, and appeared to be landing on a clear grass area between the trees across the valley. It then climbed up to eye level and started to fly towards us. \"By this time there were three other people who witnessed this UFO: Averill Boylan from Tauranga, New Zealand; and our hosts, Ainsley and Darlene Bell. \"As we watched, it seemed to turn along the contour of the hills before changing direction and flying across the valley towards the rocky outcrop on our side of the valley before it took off at great speed towards Denver, then, dis- appearing up into the clouds. \"We were able to take two photos as it began to gather speed. The report was given to John Schuessler at MUFON the following morning. \"I think, George, this really made our trip to the USA a pretty exciting one; as our host and hostess had never seen a UFO or believed up until this time.\" North Dakota saucer sighted TUTTLE - The observer reports, \"I am a 16-year-old girl, and my 17-year- old male friend and I were driving around our small town at 2 AM on May 28,2005, when we saw a straight line of red lights. \"We were curious, so we followed the lights that were southwest of us. As we got closer we saw a circular object with red lights with little bars across them. At this point you could see it was very big. \"I lost it as it crossed the road, but my friend pointed to the other side of the road towards the east. So, we turned on the next gravel road towards the object and watched it go right over my friend's farm. \"It was hovering for at least a minute when there appeared a smaller saucer right below the big one. \"We followed it for at least five min- utes before it disappeared, and it seemed like it was running away from us.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. New York loss of satellite radio GLENS FALLS - The witness was listening to Sirius Satellite Radio when the signal started to break up for no ap- parent reason on May 28,2005, at 5:55 16 MUFON UFO Journal August 2005"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"PM. Satellite radio is designed to provide perfect radio reception, since there is nothing blocking the receiver's path. The witness reports, \"Suddenly, there was no signal/sound. When I checked around, I jokingly stated to my family that the satellite must have exploded, which prompted me to look up. \"To my surprise, I noticed a 'black dot' (craft) in the sky. The object never moved. On this day there were some passing clouds at different altitudes. Clouds would pass over the object and it would remain in view. \"A series of clouds passed below the object, and visual was lost. Moments later the radio began to regain the signal of the satellite. When the clouds passed, the object was gone \"One witness was able to retrieve bin- oculars and make a visual, but all that could be established was that the object was reflecting the sunlight. The satellite radio was lost for about 10-15 minutes. Visual of craft was about 3-5 minutes.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Washington sighting by experts MT. ADAMS - One of the witnesses reports, \"There were four Boeing man- agers present on Saturday, June 4,2005, to a UFO sighting. The four professional aerospace witnesses, including myself, know better than armchair naysayers what celestial objects are observed. \"I have seen dozens of missile launches, myriad aircraft under all con- ditions, and I am intimately familiar with the US radar, space, and missile tech- nology and advanced capabilities. , \"AtlO:15PM,Itriedtopowerupmy digital camera for the really awesome one of the four UFOs I saw, but I was too late. We were looking towards the mountain until midnight \"We were guests of James Gilliland at his ranch, 13 miles south of Mt. Adams, when we saw a star-sized white light crossing the sky directly above us heading south at a fairly fast clip, 'snak- ing' back and forth by several nearby stars. \"It moved across the sky for about 20 to 30 degrees of arc, and stopped, parked there, and dimmed. With the hun- AUGUST 2005 dreds of stars visible and the fact that it stopped moving, I soon lost track of the UFO's exact position. \"Our host had a telephoto lens, and saw a red light attached to its tail while it was moving. I spotted the UFO first, as I have exceptional long range vision. \"The second sighting was a brighter star-sized UFO which came into view moving west and traveling 10 to 15 de- grees of arc across the sky at about a 60-degree angle from the ground. \"It took a smooth 35-degree arcing turn to the NNW, traveled a short dis- tance, and stopped high above Mt Adams. No dimming. \"The third and best sighting was a me- dium bright star-sized UFO which came in from the WS W and meandered some- what randomly in an easterly direction. It stopped right next to a dimmer star. \"Suddenly it lit up hundreds of times brighter than it was for four seconds, moved off into space, and dimmed to nothing in a snaking trajectory. When that puppy lit up, everyone gasped, cheered, hooted, hollered, and went wild. \"The fourth sighting was a star-sized UFO traveling south when it 'flashed' like a strobe pulse, then returned to a very dim object. A few seconds later, it flashed again, and dimmed. \"This scenario was repeated 12 times while crossing directly overhead and traveling 35 degrees of the sky, chang- ing directions multiple times. The flashes were randomly timed. The UFO then stopped above us, and parked there for the rest of the night.\" Thanks to R.A Illinois teardrop FRANKLIN PARK - The witness was in his yard having a smoke and saw a bright flash of light like a camera flash, but pinpoint in size to the west at 11 PM on May 22,2005. He says, \"My view was obstructed for about 15 seconds by trees, but it was heading towards me. As it approached, I began to see color and shape. It passed directly overhead and continued east until I could no longer see it. \"It was glowing an orange-yellow color, and the lights on the bottom of it appeared to be segmented into three rectangular shapes, nearly the same in MUFON UFO JOURNAL shape and size. There was a halo of light surrounding it that was more yellow in color and appeared misty. That is how me teardrop type shape was seen. \"The object was rotating counter- clockwise on what appeared to be an asymmetrical axis at one revolution ev- ery 3 or 4 seconds. The revolutions and lateral speed were constant. \"Though the defining lines of the ob- ject could not be seen clearly, I got a distinct view of the underside. I called my step-daughter out, but she only saw it briefly rotate in the distance.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Minnesota triangle FERGUS FALLS - Three witnesses at different locations made observations of a flying triangle. Witnesses in the town were observ- ing the Northern Lights in the distance when they observed a bright orange tri- angle that appeared from the east at tree- top level and moved slowly north, disap- pearing at 3 AM on May 20,2005. The object made no sound. The night was clear and still. The object would fit inside the full moon, if the full moon was about half its normal size. Another witness in Fergus Falls indi- cated that the object was in the northern sky, from his vantage point. The second witness, who lived three blocks to the north of the first witness, indicates that she had seen the object to the south, from her vantage point at her home. If that second report is true, the ob- ject may have been located between the two witnesses. Canada flashing saucer lights TORONTO - Agnes Sroczynski writes, \"On June 22,2005, at about 10 PM, in the Flemington Park area of the city, my friend and I witnessed a disc- shaped metallic object from the eleventh floor window of my friend's apartment. \"The object had large, white, spheri- cal lights on the sides, flashing quickly and erratically. It was close to the build- ing, and not far above us. Only one or two lights were visible at any one time. \"The object danced a dizzying pattern in the sky while it continued traveling west, extremely fast. This is a good spot for sightings in Toronto.\" 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Physical Traces By Ted Phillips Ted Phillips Occupants and physical traces In looking through my files I note that 731 events, or 23.9% of all reported physical trace events, involved the ob- servation of occupants, and 41% of the reported occupant events involved multiple witnesses. These occupants are usually de- scribed as quite small, 1 meter tall, with very thin bodies and little hair. The majority of trace landing cases with sight-, ings of beings follow the same story line: the object lands in the most remote section of a farm and generally out of sight of the farmer's home. Very often it's that pesky farm dog barking that alerts the witness to the event. It appears that the last thing \"they\" want is contact of any kind. Many cases involve the witness standing in the middle of a dense woods in the dark of night-the perfect chance, to snatch him away and do a little prob- ing, but this rarely occurs. There are events which seem to in- dicate a problem with the object, the need to download something which is many times described as a luminous spray which can have quite an effect on the soil and plants. It doesn't seem likely they are just flying around spray- ing plants to help farmers with their crops. In one case in Kansas, I believe that the object was forced to land near a sheep pen, crashing its way into the area because it had to. It just happened to be the very best spot to conceal such a device in some really flat country. When the device finally took off, it crossed a road and bumped across a farm field with the irate farmer watch- 18 ing. Unless \"they\" have an odd concept of flying, they were having problems. Perhaps the high tech we seem to as- sume is there, is not. The following cases from the TRACAT/CPTR files represent signifi- cant humanoid observations and the re- sulting physical traces found at the site of the reported events. Pre-1950 Events 06/12/1790 0500. France, Alencon: Several fanners caught sight of a large globe which was surrounded by flames. A whistling sound was heard. The spherical object slowed, made some oscillations, and moved to- ward the top of a hill, unearthing plants along the slope. The heat was so intense that grass and small trees started burning. In the evening the sphere was still warm. Witnesses: two mayors, a doctor, three other authorities, in addition to the dozens of peasants who were present. A kind of door opened, and a person came out of it. The person was dressed in a strange way, wore a tightfitting suit, saw all the people, said some words that were not understood, and ran into the woods. The sphere exploded silently, throw- ing pieces everywhere, and these pieces burned until they were powder. (From a report of June 17,1790, by Police In- spector Liabeuf)- 1893 Australia, Central NSW: A fanner observed a circular object on the ground, the witness approached, a man in odd clothing exited the object, and pointed some kind of \"torch\" at the witness, hitting his hand, and throwing the farmer to the ground. The witness was stunned, and when he regained consciousness the object and occupant were gone. The hand, where the torch beam had struck was reportedly paralyzed for life. 05/18/09 2300 Wales, Caerphilly: The witness was walking along a road near the mountains when he saw on the MUFON UFO Journal grass a large tube-like object. He saw two men wearing fur coats and talking in a language he couldn't understand. The grass was found depressed where the object rested after it ascended 02/22/22 0500 NB, Hubbell: Will- iam Lamb was following strange tracks when he heard a high pitched sound and saw a circular object. It became very bright and landed in a hollow. A being 2.4 m tall was seen. It left tracks in the snow. 02/05/34 Norway, Malselv: People on both sides of Fager Mountain saw an aerial object crash land on the moun- tain. The next day, a kind of machine was seen on the mountain. Rescuers found no machine, but a circular trace and footprints.  . 07/00/39 1200 Spain, Zahara De Los Atunes: Several young children were resting in the shade under some large trees when nearby goats became agitated and stampeded down a nearby hill. The children saw a huge metallic disc-shaped object which flew low above them, emitting a strong heat. The object descended and landed in a great cloud of dust in a nearby clearing. It emitted a loud whistling sound as it touched the ground. The object had a band of red, yel- low, and green lights around its edge. A door opened, and a tall figure clad in a silvery suit, with headgear and a wide belt, emerged, quickly followed by a shorter similarly dressed figure. They both walked with very stiff movements. Their silvery suits covered their faces, and both had two black holes where the eyes should have been. Both figures took out an object resem- bling a flashlight and walked 50 yards from the object. They eventually returned into the object, which ascended at tremendous speed. Ground traces were found and were still visible 41 years later. 11/29/391700 Finland, Saarijarvi: August 2005"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"14 -year-old Arvo was in the forest with his father collecting firewood. They headed home at twilight, and the boy noticed on the right side of the path on a small rocky hill some 2-3m high a strange device 3 to 4 m in diameter. His father wouldn't let him go nearer. He observed the object from 70 m. It was about 2.5 m high, supported by three landing legs made of three rods ending in triangular plates. The bottom section was rounded like a kettle. From the bottom of the object came a \"dull\" flame like that of an up- side down candle, 1.5 m long, emitting a loud noise resembling that of escap- ing gas. Standing outside the object was a 160 cm tall human-like figure which was clad in a suit with a round helmet which had an oval opening. The being was carrying a box, which he was using to direct two or three ro- bot-like creatures, which had box^-like heads. At least one of these robots lifted its legs very high when walking. Arvo could see that the legs were like two rods below the knees, ending in a plate. The next day the Winter War be- gan, but Arvo went to the site, despite his father's objections, who also refused to go collect firewood with him. At the place where the object was seen there was a triangular mark of a support leg. There was also a strong, unpleasant smell in the area. 06/00/44 1100 TX, Minden: Ida Blant, a 65-year-old woman who owned a boarding house eight miles from Minden, observed the landing of an object with a blinding light, 200 ft away. A 5.9 m circular area was burnt. 05/00/46 Sweden, Angelholm: Gosta Carlsson had been looking for pollen for his bees when he saw a light in an open space in the forest nearby. When he reached the spot he saw a disc with a dome. The dome had oval windows. Above it there was a mast like a periscope. Be- neath the disc there was a large oblong fin which stretched from the center to the edge. There were two metal land- ing legs, and a small ladder reached to the ground from a door beside the fin. The object was 56 feet in diameter and 15 feet thick. There were holes around the edge. Light beams extended from these and burned the grass as the object ascended. Three antennas were seen near the mast, which was 18 feet long. Where the light hit the ground he could see a sparkling effect. A man in white close-fitting coveralls was seen, who raised his hand and the witness stopped, less than 35 feet away. The man was normal in size. The witness saw a number of other people who appeared to be repairing a window. The object ascended with a whistling sound. A circular area 40 feet hi diameter was found. 00/00/49 MO, Lamonte: Anna Fulton saw an object land in a nearby field. Brilliant light beams were pro- jected from openings around the base of the object. After several minutes the circular object made a vertical ascent. While on the ground a small being was seen near the object. At the site a circular burned area 20 feet in diam- eter with a strong odor was found. 1950's 1950 through 1953 produced an av- erage of six humanoid/trace cases yearly; the following examples are the most significant. 04/24/50 Italy, Abbiate Guazzone: Bruno Facchini saw a dark mass hov- ering 200 yards from his home. A man dressed in tight-fitting clothes and wearing a helmet appeared to be mak- ing repairs. There were three other figures work- ing around the object. A trap through which light had been shining was closed, and the object took off. The occupants were of normal size. They made sounds and pointed a camera-like device at the witness, a beam of light was projected toward him, and he was knocked away. At the site, metal fragments were found, also four circular imprints and patches of scorched grass. The incident had other witnesses. 06/22/52 2300 TN, Little Spring Creek: A man hears odd sounds and sees a shiny thing on the ground, with bright light coming through an open door. Through the door he can see four or five beings, 4 ft tall. The object is aluminum colored, glowing orange and blue in spots, some of which are too bright to look at di- rectly. Rotating lights on a translucent ball on top are seen. Object is on four legs, each with a ball at the end, and a center spike. It stands 3-4 feet off the ground, 7 - 8 feet thick at the center, disc-shaped. Beings enter the device, which ascends vertically in a twisting, cork-screw motion, glowing brighter as it rises. Traces include imprints and a cen- ter spike mark, along with small heel- less footprints. 07/15/52 Germany, Gleimer- shausen: Mayor Oskar Linke and his 12-year-old stepdaughter saw a landed circular object and occupants. They moved to within 30 feet. The object was 50 feet across with two rows of holes along the side, each about one foot in diameter. A black cylindrical tower was seen at the top center; it was about 10 feet high, went through the disc, and the object was resting on it. The object slowly ascended, and a whistling sound was heard. Several people in a nearby village saw it flying overhead. A circular depression where the tower had rested was found. 08/06/52 NC, Lumberton: James Allen, 51, saw a round object 8 ft long, 6 ft high land within 10 feet of him. A small occupant was seen, and small footprints were found. 1954 produced the first \"wave\" of humanoid reports involving physical evidence. 09/02/54 2000 KS, Coldwater: John Jacob Swaim saw a 50 ft disc hov- ering five ft above the ground. One be- ing the size of a five-year-old child was seen 20 feet from him. The being wore shiny clothing and carried 2-foot long cylinders on his back. The being floated to the object, which ascended. Lighted windows could be seen on the object. At the site, numerous pear-shaped footprints 2 inches x 4.5 inches were found. Next month I will look at additional cases in which both physical traces and occupants were present.

Friedman Larry King UFO Show A few months ago I wrote about the two-hour ABC-TV prime time UFO \"documentary,\" \"UFOs: Seeing is Be- lieving,\" created by Peter Jennings Pro- ductions and hosted by Peter himself on Feb. 24. A great deal of time, money, and ef- fort went into the show with 150 people being interviewed at many different lo- cations. There were even re-creations of such important events as astronomer Jill Tartar mistaking the moon for a UFO. Most of the show was a journalisti- cally irresponsible and massively mis- leading potpourri of abductions, inter- stellar travel, and the Roswell incident, as I have noted on my website (www.stantonfriedman.com) In stark contrast, Larry King did a cheap one-hour show on July 6. There'were four representatives from the UFO community with a total of about 140 years of serious study of different aspects of the UFO phenom- enon. Retired Aerospace Engineer John Schuessler worked on the space pro- gram for decades and is International Director of MUFON. Budd Hopkins has worked with over 600 abductees, and has written several books about his work. He has made many presentations at MUFON sym- posia. Rob Swiatek is a physicist who has worked for the Patent Office for many years and is involved with the Fund for UFO Research, as well as MUFON. Dr. Bruce Maccabee is an optical physicist who has written three books about UFOs, and is one of the few sci- entists to have published peer reviewed articles about UFOs in refereed scien- tific journals: The Journal of the Opti- cal Society of America and the Jour- nal of the British Interplanetary Soci- ety. In opposition there was the inimi- table Dr. Seth Shostak, an astronomer 20 with the SETI Institute (about whom I have written a Journal column, and with whom I won a debate on Coast to Coast Radio), and Dr. Susan A. Clancy of Harvard, author of a new book Ab- ducted: How People Come to Believe They were Kidnapped by Aliens. Both Sho- stak and Clan- cy were in the Jennings pro- gram, as was Budd. Neither John's inter- view with the Jennings people nor the other inter- views done at the 2004 MU- Stan Friedman FON sympo- sium made the Jennings cut. Although Budd did, selective choice of data by the editor was certainly the rule, ignoring the many cases involv- ing more than one person, not involv- ing hypnosis, and not involving people at sleep-plus ignoring the physical marks on abductees so as to set the stage for Clancy and cohorts' absurd notion that sleep paralysis explains all reports of UFO abductions. Having done a show with Larry King out in the desert near Area 51 in 1994 with Dr. Steven Greer, Kevin Randle, and Glenn Campbell, I know that such shows are difficult even when all the participants are in sight of each other and in the same place. Larry is the only one who knows when a commercial or a call or a clip will be on. When people are in differ- ent locations and can't see the others it is much tougher. I thought then, and after watching this show, that Larry was fair. There were mistakes made. For ex- ample, Bruce Maccabee was intro- duced without mentioning that he had MUFON UFO Journal a PhD in Physics, or even that he was a physicist. He was also described as working with NIC AP, which died about 25 years ago. Rob was not given a professional title either. Questions raised near the end of a segment were not continued at the beginning of the next segment. Of course there was no mention of physical trace cases, such as the more than 3,000 collected by Ted Phillips from 90 countries. There was no mention of the largest scientific study ever done for the US Government, namely Project Blue Book Special Report 14, nor of Dick Hall's The UFO Evidence, nor of As- tronomer J. Allen Hynek's book The UFO Experience, nor of the Congres- sional hearings of 1969 with testimony from 12 scientists. The Condon Report was referred to by Susan Clancy with a totally false claim that it had been sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences. It was actually sponsored by the United States Air Force. It did include a supposed review by the NAS. Unfortunately, as has been noted in a critique by Dr. James E. MacDonald, the NAS did not check on the investigation of any of the 117 cases studied in detail under Condon, who was himself a member of the NAS. Clancy naturally didn't mention that according to a UFO subcommittee of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 30% of the Condon Report cases couldn't be explained. It was clear throughout the show that Shostak and Clancy had answers for the pictures and the reports without hav- ing done the slightest investigation of any of them. Larry asked what something was in a picture (McMinnville, Santa Ana) and they responded that somebody could have tossed an object in the air. This was said after Bruce and/or Rob had noted that the pictures had passed mus- ter by experts. August 2005"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"How in the world can a supposed scientist express an opinion without having studied the relevant evidence?. One would think there was no way to tell how far away something was from a picture, but there is when other things are in the picture whose size and distance can be determined, as well as image sharpness. Dr. Clancy in her first comment said, \"I started studying aliens while a gradu- ate student at Harvard.\" On both shows she says people are suffering from sleep paralysis ..(even when they are not asleep and are driving or walking), so there are no aliens around. Obviously she has studied no aliens and has done no homework on alien abductions. She is a co-author of a paper \"Psy- chophysiological Responding During Script Driven Imagery in People Re- porting Abduction by Space Aliens\" (Psychological Science 15/7, 2004). There are 28 references. None are to serious studies of UFO abductions by Budd Hopkins or Dr. David Jacobs or even Harvard's Dr.John Mack. John is acknowledged for publiciz- ing her research program among poten- tial participants. Strangely enough this fancy sounding paper involved work with a grand total of 6 women and 4 men, average age of 47.3. Considering that the total of abductees that Budd, David, and John have worked with exceeds 1,000, one wonders whether conclusions based on 10 should carry a strong weight. There was no indication in the paper that either Clancy or any of her coau- thors had actually investigated any of the abductions. What was the selection criteria? Only persons by themselves, in bed, who had been hypnotized? In this paper the term \"highly im- probable traumatic experience\" is used more than once. No reason is given for this terminology. Obviously many highly improbable experiences occur. How many people are struck by lightning? What fraction of sperm wind up causing the conception of a new be- ing? Both things do happen, though very improbable. Obviously it is highly improbable that a person will be killed in an auto- mobile accident in the next year. The fact is that about 40,000 Americans will have this highly improbable traumatic experience. Shostak adds another gem: \"Despite 58 years of sightings, nobody can put a piece of evidence on this desk. If you go to the local science museum and look for some display showing what we have learned, what we have collected from all these sightings, there is nothing there.\" More balderdash. He might try the International UFO Museum and Re- search Center in Roswell, or earlier this year could have gone to the Southwest Florida Museum of History in Ft. Myers, which had a fine Roswell ex- hibit. It was their largest draw ever. In ad- dition they brought me in for two es- sentially sold out seminars. It really takes Chutzpah for a SETI cultist to say there is nothing there when there is an enormous amount of UFO evidence-and when SET! has provided exactly none that there is anybody out there (ignoring the UFO evidence, as they always do), and that even if there is anybody there that they are using such primitive techniques that we can intercept and interpret their signals. That I can't put a piece of wreckage on his desk doesn't mean there isn't any. Naturally he ignores the national secu- rity aspects of advanced technology. Has he provided a piece of a neutron star or of a black hole? He states, \"We are not studying aliens that might be invading our air- space. I don't think that the aliens are buzzing the countryside. I just don't think the evidence is good enough for that. I don't think it's proven. But I do think that there is something out there. There is clearly, to my mind, enormous probability that there's life out there, even intelligent life.\" I guess wishful thinking to protect one's livelihood triumphs over evidence any time. Who cares about his evalua- tion when his written and spoken words clearly indicate he knows nothing about the subject? I will admit that I was disappointed that none of the four knowledgeable guests would own up to saying that some UFOs are extraterrestrial space- craft-meaning objects manufactured elsewhere than on our planet at this time. Even if they are time travelers or from a parallel dimension, I would con- sider them of ET origin. Strange as it may seem to some people, I have had only 11 hecklers (2 of whom were drunk) after more than 700 lectures in which I have stated this conclusion. Good show, guys. But come on in; the water is fine, fsphys@rogers.com \"Meteor\" followed by black helicopters On June 23,2005, at 11:47 PM, Carl Farrington was driving on a mountain road near Canton, NC, when he saw a most unusual spectacle. \"I took (Route) 110 out of Canton and turned left onto (Highway) 276.1 went straight up to the Blue Ridge Parkway,\" Carl reported. \"Then I turned left and turned into the famous overlook on the left, facing a bright orange moon that day after the full moon. \"What at first appeared to be a shoot- ing star, but brighter than I have ever seen, plummeted towards the ground and impacted in the Smokies approxi- mately six to nine miles straight ahead. \"As it got closer to the point of im- pact, I noticed bright matter dripping off of it, streaming behind the main mass of the object. It could've been a meteor or space debris. \"However, on the way to the house, three dark helicopters flew over my car, and they had no lights on whatsoever. \"They were flying at a high rate of speed approximately 300 to 400 feet off the ground-and hugging the terrain is very dangerous in this area. \"The object was bright white and al- most teardrop-shaped. It definitely im- pacted the ground. If it was a meteor, it was a big chunk. It came straight down like a missile and im- pacted the ground without an explosion. \"I was too far away to hear anything, as it was six to nine miles away. I saw it at a higher elevation than the impact zone, and was looking down.\" -UFO Roundup, Vol. 10, No. 26, Joseph Trainor.
