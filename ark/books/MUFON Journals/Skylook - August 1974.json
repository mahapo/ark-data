McCampbell as .a con- sultant in Research Planning. An engineering consultant by profession, Jim is the author of the outstanding book titled \"UFOLOGY--NEW. IN- SIGHTS FROM SCIENCE AND COMMON SENSE\" published in 1973, discussing technical concepts of UFO's. He resides at 12 Bryce Court, Belmont, Calif. 94002 and is a close friend of Dr. Jacques Vallee. Men of Mr. McCampbell's stature in the field of engineering, now devoting their personal time and talents to the UFO phenomenon, is a tra- mendous asset to the scientific study. It is with regret that we announce the resig- nation of John F. Schuessler as State Director for Missouri, due to his job transfer by McDon- nell-Douglas Astronautics from St. Louis, Mo., to the Johnson Space Center at Houston, Texas. His leadership and motivation to the UFO Study Group of Greater St. Louis will be sadly missed. John, of course, continues to fill the important post -of Deputy Director of the Mutual UFO Network, and as a consultant to MUFON in astronautics.' He will soon be accepting MUFON responsibility for the Houston area. John is already becoming ac- quainted with the news media personnel in Houston as part of MUFON public relations. Projects in, process or being contemplated by 'MUFON as a result of the annual corporate meeting in Akron, Ohio, on June 23, 1974, consist of the following: (1) Publishing of the revised second edition of \"The Field Investigators Manual\" under the guidance of Ron Westrum, MUFON consultant in sociology from Ann Arbor, Michigan; (2) Filing for I.R.S. tax exempt status, and (3) Revision of. MUFON by-laws and constitution. Election of MUFON corporate officers for 1974-1975 include the fol- lowing gentlemen: Director, Walter H. Andrus\", Jr., Quincy, 111.; Deputy Director, John F. Schuessler, Houston, Texas; Corporate Secretary, Ted Phillips, Sedalia, Mo.; and Corporate Treas- urer, Fields F. Freeman, Quincy, 111. It is a pleasure to announce that N. Joseph Gurney has accepted the newly created staff po- sition to MUFON as director of publications. He will be responsible for the coordination, direc- tion, and publishing of all MUFON publications (except for Skylook, which is being ably handled by Editor and Publisher Dwight Connelly and Bus- .iness Manager Mrs. Carolyn Connelly, as a finan- cially separate publication). Joe will have a staff of artists, photographers, typists, and printers to properly support this important func- tion. He has had wide experience in this field, not only as one of the co-editors of our MUFON UFO Symposium Proceedings, but professionally with the McDonnell-Douglas Corporation. A new director of public relations will be selected in . the near future to fill the vacancy created by Joe's new responsibilities. Due to the growth of MUFON, expanded member- ship services, and coordination of UFO scientific endeavors, the administrative offices of MUFON have been relocated into larger and more appro- priate facilities at 40 Christopher Court, Quincy, Illinois. . Humanoid Study Group meets .By Dave Webb Along with other activities at the recent MUFON Symposium, the first meeting of the MUFON Humanoid Study Group was very successful. This group was first mentioned in the June issue of Skylook on p. 13. At least 25 people managed to miss most of their lunch to- attend the meeting on Saturday, June 22. Ted Bloecher and I led a lively discussion on the need for establishing a central depository for humanoid reports, for in- creasing the reporting of \"hidden\" cases, for making this file computer-compatible for use with such computer files as UFOCAT, and of methods that might be used in analyzing the data. About ten persons at the meeting indicated that they had large files of humanoid reports and would be willing to contribute cases.to the Study Group's file. The scope of the group's work was , discussed; for the moment work will be limited to developing as complete a file as possible of all humanoid cases. All humanoid reports are to be included initially, whether involving UFOs or not, so as not to prejudice the sample. However the \"creature\" reports, involving anthropoid-like beings, will be included only if UFO activity is involved. Stan Gordon will continue to cover this aspect of the phenomenon. Ted and I will contact several of the European sources known to have extensive humanoid files. The. Humanoid. Study Group is one of several MUFON groups specializing in various aspects of UFOs. Ted Phillips is Specialization Coordina- •tor; he offered us much good advice, at the Sym- posium and we will work closely with him in the future. Walt. Andrus was also very helpful and agreed to. channel. MUFON's humanoid reports to us. Humanoid or- - occupant reports are solicited from Skylook readers. If you have reports not previously published, or if you are interested in working with the Study Group, contact either Ted Bloecher or myself. Our addresses were listed in recent issues of Skylook. Ted and I will be con- tr.ibuting. to. a monthly section in Skylook on the Humanoid. Study Group's activities and these re- ports in general to keep you informed."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"-06 the. f^-Lut 0f$ a bnniu o£ thsite. photo* : o££egeci£i/ -taken oft a UFO -in Co.t4.tca -in 1971. The. photo* wesie. aoion tnan&pasie.ncA.eA. 1971 Corsica photos By Joe Brill International Coordinator The photos .appearing in conjunction with this article seem to be among the genuine UFO photos which have come to the attention of ufologists. Originally shot on transparency (slide) film, some loss of quality was of course experienced in printing the shots onto color paper. Further loss of quality occurred as the color prints are published in Skylook in black and white. Never- theless, the series of three photos, accompanied by the testimony of multiple witnesses, is im- pressive, even in black and white printing. As to how these three photographs were taken, the circumstance was as follows: A family from Grenoble, France, had a second residence in Cor- sica.- They had just adjusted their camera on a tripod in order to take some photographs of their new house when they spotted a strange obj ect in the sky. They were able to take three color shots of it before it moved off. The date of this sighting was Feb. 12, 1971. ....Perhaps the most detailed evaluation of the photos to date appeared in the French magazine \"Phenomenes Inconnus.\" Through the work of MUFON translator Linda Galloway, the :French article follows: AN EXCEPTIONAL PHOTOGRAPHIC DOCUMENTATION By Phillippe Tournier Electrical Engineer and Scientific Consultant to OURANOS . (French UFO organization) Location: On the .road from -'Olmo.in Corsica, about twenty kilometers from Bastia.

Quality of the photographs: The best copy studied was the one measuring 125 millimeters by 85 millimeters, printed on paper and in color, which Pierre Deval showed to me. We attempted, to the best of our ability, to think of all the indications which could prove that they were fake. The photographs as such were of very good quality and the original trans- parencies (three in number) were of an exception- Photo 3. al .-quality/ The \"object in question seems to be completely finished from our limited point of view. The background of the sky-is the blue' of a beautiful 'evening, and the object certainly seems to be in front of some small' white clouds present in the photograph. The copy studied was printed from the second transparency, which shows the ob- ject most clearly. (See photo No. 2) For a good study of possible faking,, it would be necessary to know 'the effects' of air density, which would -give \"a more' precise- measure of ' the distance from the photographer to the object. If"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"it is a fake, what kind of ordinary object or ob- ject adapted, to the occasion, could have been used: Furthermore, since between the second and third photographs the object has turned slightly while maintaining the same angle, a very numerous (and therefore expensive in film) series of shots of manual launchings of an object would not have such a coherency of movement in successive shots. Only an object suspended by an invisible thread from a support outside of the field of view could have permitted such a convincing fake. I think we must study these photographs with the idea that their authenticity is certain. The two slits resembling portholes have been widely studied since the biginning, so I will not dwell on them at all. The first question which I asked myself concerned the large shiny spot on the lower front rim, in the middle of the disc. Because of the effect of the shadows, this spot (or bump) gives the impression of a hollow on the rim of the disc to its right. Could it be a bump or protuberance on the rim of the disc, indicat- ing a possible observation apparatus (see the case of Mendoza, Argentina May 24, 1971), or, could it be an interior dome underneath the disc of which we see only the lowest part, the rest being hid by the rim of the disc, or could it be a question of two structures at the same time? The glare is too bright and the photographs of the object too small for us to be able to draw a conclusion. The second question (perhaps the most import- ant) is the unquestionable presence of a certain number of very clear, radial, seemingly white stripes starting at the .edge of the disc and stopping approximately halfway between the edge and the foot of the upper dome. In order to lo- cate the stripes I shall use the method of direc- tion given by the hands of a watch by assuming a shadow, on the object, whose axis corresponds to that of the \"saucer\" seen from underneath, noon being turned to the right towards the bottom of the picture. The first visible stripe is located at about 2:00. The second stripe, even more vis- ible, is located .at about 3:30. These first-two \"white\" stripes are located in the shaded part, to the right of the photograph and are quite vis- ible. A third stripe, less visible because\"it is in the lighted front part, appears at about' 5:00. (End of \"Phenomenes;inconnus\" article) * \" In examining these three photographs myself, I have, found that the very obvious cloud seen in photo No. 2 is also seen clearly in;the other two. photos. This would seem to make it obvious that these three photographs were taken in rapid suc- cession as the cloud appears exactly the same in all three pictures. Also it's position in re- lation to the tree is the same in all . three photos, which would point out that the object changed it's location while being photographed. Another interesting item is the position of the sun while these photos were taken. According to oft photo -nwnb&i. 3. the given report from France it was \"low.on the horizon.\" It can easily be seen that on photo No. 1 the sun is shining off the leaves of the tree in the .bottom left hand portion of the photo. The object at this time is tipped- -at an angle where the sun is striking it so -that only a very small section of it has a shadow. I believe the sun is \"low on the horizon\" as.stated and that the tree and the UFO bear that fact out. My last comment on these three UFO photos is that in each of the photos there appears the top portion of apparently dead branches of this tree. By overlaying these photos you can see the move- ment which was made by the object while it was photographed. Also, I believe the camera was turned by the photographer as the ; first shot is more the way I would expect the camera to be set up on a tripod for photographing a house and the surrounding area. These photographs appear to be genuine photographs of a strange flying disc. I present the photos and the written facts for your inspection. 1974 MUFON Symposium Proceedings .

When Albert Einstein said that \"God is subtle, but he is not dowright mean\"! he was referring to the kinds of difficulties scientists have in interpreting nature. As an expression of the at- titude which a. scientist might take when studying nature, this orientation, is apt. But is it the attitude one .should take when studying UFOs? Since we have so often turned to scientists for their opinions on Unidentified Flying Objects, it may be useful to remind ourselves that the scien- tist views nature as perhaps difficult to de- cipher; he does not view it as deliberately try- ing to deceive .him. However,, when we are dealing with the possibility of another race (or species) of intelligent beings acting as the pilots, oper- ators, or originators of UFOs, the question of deception is very germane..•.. Jacques Vallee arid John Keel have dealt with the problem of deception . in two recent books.2 Both show how the details of UFO sightings and their surrounding events suggest that the sight- ings or contacts were either deceptions - them- selves or were designed .to deliberately mislead the sighters. But regardless,, of the .nature of specific incidents, which in any case are open to a varietyjOf interpretations, we must.not forget the general point that the beings responsible for UFOs may have interests which differ from ours. It is important to focus on the question of \"interests\" rather than benevolence versus hos- tility, because, as any child knows, benevolence can be very painful (\"This is going to hurt you more than it hurts me.\"). Hence, specific inci- dents of contact may be pleasant or unpleasant to the observers without this at all being a re- liable indicator as to the ultimate intentions of. the \"beings\" involved. Beings with an overall hostile intent may act like perfect-angels until the moment when the trigger is pulled. Similarly, interplanetary religious missionaries might well be responsible for accidental deaths without de- siring them in the least. The basic point about looking at the UFO enigma from the point of view of conflicting interests, however, is that one must adopt a \"strategic\" as opposed, to a \"scientific\" per- spective. We have spent an enormous amount of time trying to show that UFOs are real and that scientists ought to pay attention to them; in fact these attempts continue. But it is obvious that the rate of conversion of the scientific community by these attempts is -low, although per- haps not negligible. Yet sometimes one also has the feeling that the -marshalling of .evidence has as a less explicit aim to fortify the confidence .of the writer himself. If one really believes that UFOs exist, further marshalling of evidence is unnecessary as far as the researchers them- selves are concerned. The real questions then become: What is the nature of UFOs? and What are their aims? For. the person who . specializes in the study of social conflicts, there is a basic question whose answer affects how one might go about an- swering the other two: What steps is the opponent taking to decieve me? If one looks at the process by which we find out about UFOs, 'then it is.ob- vious that there 'are .many opportunities for de- ception and disinformation. For the strategist, the issue is not: What do I know? but rather, How do I know it?- Because the strategist is used to thinking, not in terms of the gradual ac- cumulation of facts, but in terms of move and countermove.3 It may be that scientists in gen- eral are hot used to thinking in the latter set of terms^ except in wartime. In any case, what I wish to suggest here is that thinking in such terms, rather than in. \"scientific\" patterns of thought, may be very useful for understanding UFO occupant behavior. Serious students of the UFO problem, however, wish to avoid this style of thinking, since it is associated with the paranoid fringe (or is it the majority?) of UFO \"buffs.\" But a little consider- ation will show that, just as this style of thought is well adapted to certain situations in international relations, it also has applications in inter-species affairs. Even a benevolent group of beings might wish to, say, decieve us as to .who they are for our own good, of course. Hence, one must consider, if the hypothesis of non-identical interests is taken seriously, just what a clever opponent might do if he wished to deceive us as to his nature and capabilities. Let me suggest several types of deceptive prac- tices that might be used: 1) Avoidance of Detection. This is often suggested in those accounts which do not necces- sarily see UFO behavior as hostile. Thus, UFOs land in night-time hours, they tend to pick rural landing places, occupants are likely to descend still later at night, and so forth. 5 In some treatments of. the UFO problem whose general aim is to debunk UFOs as real, the non-announce- ment of themselves\"by UFO occupants to members of Congress and the scientific community is used as evidence that the phenomenon is spurious.6 This argument might possess some merit if it could be assumed that there was no conflict of interest between humans and UFO beings', and that the latter would adopt a strategy of immediate con^ ,tact with little preliminary reconnaissance. If terrestrial history, is any guide, however '-, con- tacts between technically superior and inferior peoples do not always take place on such a straight-forward., basis. Would humans take a straight-forward approach? I doubt it. And fin- ally .-there is the argument that benevolent extra-, \"terrestrials (whatever benevolent.\" might mean in"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"this context) might wish to minimize the harmful consequences of interplanetary (or whatever) con- tact by first seeking to understand terrestrial culture. 2) The Use of \"Noise.\" The aim of this strategy would be to hide actual landings or re- connaissances in a \"noise\" blanket, so that alien craft would be confused with natural phenomena and hallucinations. Whereas the first strategy would seek concealment through avoidance, the second would seek concealment through camouflage. A great number of events which seem to be in the same class as UFOs would then turn out to be hoaxes, misidentifications, or would possess in- ternally contradictory characteristics adverse to their credibility. Both Keel and Vallee have considered use of this strategy. The net result would be that UFOs would be linked in the public mind (and also the mind of elite decision-makers) with hoaxes, psychosis, misidentifications, and so forth. A variation of this strategy is to provide, through human stooges, \"reasonable\" ex- planations of unreasonable events. This variant may have been employed in the \"airship\" sightings in the late 1890's in the United States. 7 A natural extension of this sort of strategy would be to mask increases in the tempo of UFO reconnaissance through a series of false alarms— —e.g. the flaps. There would gradually be a perceptual adaption to a higher and higher level of UFO activity; which would mask real .changes in the nature of , UFO activities them- selves. Hence, the later outside \"experts\" enter the field of UFO studies, the greater their shock, because of the escalation of the scale of activities which is often not apparent to longtime students of UFOs. Here I speculate on the basis of subjective impressions. 3) Infiltration. Here the objective would be the disruption and neutralization of the oppon- ent's intelligence organs from within. This might be done either by appearing in human form or through the use of human agents who would then carry out the suggestions of the aliens. Such agents would seek to enter both official agencies and voluntary organizations interested in UFOs. They might then act in a variety of ways: as in- formers, sources of internal quarrels, suppliers of false information, and agent provocateurs. The suspicion of the presence of such persons would be inimical to group solidarity. More important, such persons might reinforce group interest in courses of action which would lead to dead ends, or cause public ridicule. 4) Destruction of Evidence. This would take place in two ways, each of which has been al- leged. On one hand, we have the propensity of \"injured\" UFOs to blow themselves up, land in bodies of water, or be helped by other craft of the same kind. On the other hand, the silencing of witnesses might be carried out in the same style as that used by criminal syndicates. The silencing of witnesses by the ubiquitous \"men in black\" has now become one of the standard (and most sought-after) features of UFO lore. One might note that, ^f_ aliens indeed have done this, that they have added some touches of their own: impersonation of military officers, disappearing transportation, etc. 8 This is not an exhaustive catalogue of UFO behavior which might have deceptive aims; and I have avoided mentioning specific cases, as those who can appreciate these arguments can easily find examples in the literature. This brief ex^ cursis is only to give the strategic point of view some airing, and to rescue its reputation, which has suffered by association with certain individuals and groups. I am trying to make the reader consider what a rational opponent might do, not to argue that in fact any one of these methods has been used. We ought to give the strategic abilities of the aliens some credit. We can at least assume that they are capable of the sort of mischief which terrestrials routinely practice on each other in international affairs. For every measure there is a countermeasure. Hence, for any strategy adopted by someone else there is an optimal counter-strategy. If there is sufficient interest, I might discuss in a later article what some counter-measure strate- gies might be. Footnotes 1. I am indebted to Albert Wohlstetter for this quotation. 2.

The young man, who wishes to remain anonymous, was motorcycling after school in his favorite spot just southeast of his home, near Sewickley, Pa. The area consists of a 1,000-acre area of woods and hilly terrain. After riding on top of a hill for awhile, the fellow proceeded down an old trail to the foot of the hill. At that time his motorcycle wasn't making, much noise as he was coasting most of the way. At the foot of the hill he turned left onto another road which happened to be in a turn. As he rounded the ,turn, still coasting, he looked up to the far end of the road. About 250 yards away, a figure was observed standing sideways facing uphill. At that point the.witness reved up his cycle several times and shifted gears, which seemed to have attracted the creature's atten- tion. The creature changed from a side position to a frontal position and half squatted at the same time. He remained in this position for a few seconds and then turned to the uphill direction and with three large steps vanished into the woods. The creature was described as being humanlike in form, ' and 7 feet or taller in height. The creature was -described as completely covered in a shiny stainless steel colored suit, which was wrinkled all over except for the head area. The head was described as being football, shaped and \"skin tight.\" Westmoreland County UFO Study Group investi- gators who searched the area, .found some, possible Astronomy Notes By Mark Herbstritt AUGUST SKY Mercury—is too close to the sun for observa- tion except for the first few \"days of the month-.

In the same spot where it was seen climbing up the hill into the woods, three impressions were found that were dug into the terrain and went straight up. Most humans climbing such a hilly area would angle their feet to obtain a better balance. More data is being gathered on the footprints at this time and anything of significance will be related in the near future. No UFO was seen in the area at the time the creature was seen. Sketch by WCUFO aK(st a investigator -William HCuh{.<"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Near landing, humanoid reported Sketch \\>y In the Blue Ridge Mountains lies the peaceful and picturesque farming community of Vesta, Va. .It will never be the same again, for on the clear night of March 1, 1974, at 8 p.m. a UFO visited the area. Several residents had noticed a round red fly- ing object that circled the community at low al- titude weeks before, but kept it to themselves for fear of ridicule. But March 1 was to be a \"different story.\" \"It was like a science fiction story come true,\" one of the witnesses, Jane Clifton '(27), stated. \"It made a shrill penetrating sound,\" exclaim- ed Mrs. Noah Cassell and her daughter Freda. \"We were afraid to go outside to see what was causing all the commotion on John Plasters's farm,\" they added. The Cassell's home was located closer to where the mysterious activity was taking place. \"I saw something, but I don't know what it was, and I've never seen anything like it before or since,\" Jane's husband, Richard N. Clifton (35), said. The first observer was Billy Wayne Plasters (27), who noticed that the whole hillside on his father's farm, off Route 58 near Vestal, was \"all lit up.\" Plasters immediately drove to the home of his twin sister and brother-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Richard N. Clifton, to alert them to what was taking place nearby. All three watched the mysterious yellow glow through the windows of the Clifton home. The three adults were startled suddenly when a reddish oval object \"bigger than a Volkswagen\" rose up to an approximate 300-foot altitude above the glowing area on the ground. It then hovered and went through a series of right angle turns and headed in a southern direction toward nearby Stuart. The Cliftons noticed that the UFO gave off \"a beam of white light\" from its bottom edge as it ascended. \"It looked like a huge round plate, fat in the middle and tapered at each end\", Plasters reported. The eyewitnesses then noticed that the hill- side light, described as \"not the color of fire- light, but more like a bright yellow Coleman lantern,\" was still there, so they decided to take a closer look. Billy and Richard jumped in- to a truck and drove across the highway toward the lighted area. Almost immediately they notic- ed that the farm animals, which normally come freely to greet people in the pasture—two white horses, a brown steer and three black calves-- were nowhere to be seen, wards the glowing light, shed. Clifton, who was shorter in height couldn't see clearly as Plaster started talking. \"Who are you?\" \"What are you doing here?\" \"What's your name?\" Suddenly Billy exclaimed, \"Something is coming at us!\" Later Plasters described •what he had seen. It looked like a \"big, tall, heavy-set man\" As they advanced to- they passed a small behind Plasters and 10"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"of Volkswagen CaH coming toward them, and he was silhouetted on a nearby ridge in front of the glowing light. Hear- ing no replies to the questions both men fled the area in blind panic.   -. Mrs. Jane Clifton was still-watching from her home vantage point on the nearby hill on that warm March evening. \"I watched the truck stop and its lights go out. It was awfully silent, when I suddenly heard the truck door slam and the motor start up. When the men came back to the house they looked like they had just seen a ghost.\" Nevertheless, they grabbed their guns and drove back to the, area for a second time, this time prepared to shoot at anything that moved. When they arrived they found some burning debris, but the light, the object, and the huge figure were gone. They returned to the Clifton's home and noti- fied the Patrick County Sheriff's Department by phone, only to be asked, \"What have you folks been drinking up there?\" and \"Are your eyes play- ing tricks on you?\" Over the phone, background comments could be heard, like, \"What do you know? Some of these folks in the Vestal Community have a 'flying saucer 1 in their back yard!\" But de- spite the frightened witnesses' voices and their frantic pleas for help, the sheriff's department did not investigate the incident. The reports did not fall on deaf ears else- where. Managing Editor Clayton Boaz and News Editor Nancy Lindsey of the Enterprise (Stuart, Va.) newspaper, together with MUFON's North Car- olina State Director George D. Fawcett and his assistant investigator Mike Leonas, both of Mount Airy, N.C., arrived days later to investigate the UFO encounter. On the morning after the night of the event, patches of charred ground extended several hun- dred yards across the hillside and down into the wooded area. The ground, ivy or laurel bushes, pine needles, broken tree limbs, fence posts, twigs and other vegetation in the sighting area were found charred and blackened in a somewhat random manner. Some parts of bushes would be brown, while other parts of the same bushes re- mained green. Some of the wood, tree limbs and twigs on the ground would be black on one side and not even be burned on the other. The widely burned ground and vegetation and bushes were not in the manner of a normal brush fire, but rather were \"scattered in patches here and there\" at random. A \"burned smell\" prevaded the whole area. The Enterprise representatives took many photo- graphs, while Fawcett and Leonas checked for me- tallic residues with metal detection devices, but found npne at the near-landing site. Fawcett and Leonas also dug up soil samples, took photographs, collected burned wood and plant life and took them to Mount Airy, N.C., where the samples were examined by Bobby Galyean and Lee Creed of the Rescue Squad and Civil Defense. The geiger counters found no radiation above normal on the soil and plant samples, but it was pointed out that an- alleged landing of a space object, would probably involve gamma radiation, which is short lived. The degree . of radiation drops off sharply after only a. few hours and may hot be measurable in a matter of days. The near-landing occurred on March 1 and the radioactivity tests were run on the . samples on March 12. Between these two dates one snowfall and several rains had occurred in the Vestal Community. The Vestal, Va., UFO encounter was \"an incred- ible sighting by credible multiple eyewitnesses,\" according to Fawcett. \"These reports were con- sistent with those elsewhere, and identical shapes, sizes, sounds, smells, colors, maneuvers, as well as effects on eyewitnesses, animals and soil and plant samples, were being reported by persons from all walks of life on a global basis during the same period of time. The Vestal ob- servers said they hoped it wouldn't happen again. If the animals could only talk, they just might say-the same thing.\" UFO course participants want government study Students completing the first formal course on \"The UFO: A Scientific Approach\" held at a south- eastern university want the government to re-open its investigation of Unidentified Flying Objects. Mutual UFO Network State Director for Alabama Prof. Ed Planz taught the course held during the Interim Term (May 13-31) at the University of Alabama. He said the student consensus stemmed from the fact that the Condon Report was conclud- ed five years ago and the late nationally known experimental physicist Edward U. Condon said if new data were to come up, this would warrant re- opening the UFO case. The students feel the data presented to them by J. Allen Hynek of Northwestern University and by Pascagoula Sheriff Fred Diamond is of a com- pelling nature for the government to -continue its earlier'studies on UFO or begin anew. Hynek said two reasons we don't yet have UFO explanations is that we don't know enough about physics or the psyche. The .class thought govern- ment sponsored research could be done in these areas. ' Hynek said one fifth of all reported sightings are still unidentified. The class feels uneasy about this sort of unknown, particularly after hearing the terror and fear that Sheriff Diamond said Hickson and Parker felt in their alleged kidnap-examination by humanoids. 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"UFO's Behind the Iron Curtain By Joe Brill I would like to thank Jeno Miklos, the MUFON Representative for Romania for providing and translating the following information regarding the research of Alexander Sift on UFO's in Ro- mania. \"I have seen extraterrestrial vehicles with my own eyes,\" says the biologist Alexander Sift of Cluj. After twenty-five years of interest and research together with careful observations, Sift has at last put forth his conclusions on the UFO phenomenon and made these findings available to the editorial staff of \"Flacara\" (The Flame) and they in turn published his story in the May 11, 1974, edition of their publication. What follows is his account of his conclusions based on many years of personal investigations and experiences. \"My life's greatest experience happened while I was in secondary school as a boy. It was about mid summer of 1953, while I was on one of my cus- tomary Sunday excursions. I arrived at the edge of a grove near Cluj. The time was around noon. On this trip I was both the witness and the vic- tim of the most unusual and frightening adventure that could possibly happen to a young schoolboy, who was timid and dreamy and who feared telling anyone what had happened to me that Sunday after- noon.\" Now, recalling the episode, the biologist told that all at once he caught sight of a bi- zarre object in the sky. It appeared to consist of a misty ball, which was milky white and some- what translucent. It was moving ahead of. him at a height of about thirty meters in a southwest direction. Then, the strange object stopped above the forest and after a, few seconds it descended slowly and disappeared behind the foliage of the trees. \"I bore in mind the place of where it appeared to land and, armed with a staff (which I always brought with me because of fear of the shepherd's dogs), I began to proceed in the direction of the landing site. As I came nearer to the place in question I saw nothing at all. The strange fly- ing object seemed to have disappeared into no- where. I continued carefully forward in the di- rection of a particular bush (the place I thought the object should have been located) and stretch- ed out the staff in order to probe around. Then, suddenly, I was astounded to see that the staff and my right arm became completely invisible. Immediately thereafter, a moist, gentle breeze, a cold breath, something invisible and unexplain- able began to exert a strong pressure upon the entire surface of my body, urging or forcing me to withdraw some steps. I felt a strong warmth in my legs and then immediately became nauseated and I vomited. I began running-home as fast as my shaky legs would carry me. .The next day I experienced some unusual sensations. I had the feeling of floating parallel to the ground and that objects around me would become dissociated; that is, a range .of missensations which, on see- ing a doctor, turned out to be very psychic dis- orders resulting from an extreme stress temporar- ily involving the neuro-vegetative system.\" • But as the years passed by,, this was put in the past and s'o the fear also was put aside. The student and then the biologist Alexander Sift re- sumed his interest and investigation of this phe- nomena, this time equipped with the knowledge of how to conduct scientific research, as well as haying read and studied a great deal of litera- ture on the UFO subject. The result is what he has presented in the following information. Since 1960 to the present these unidentified flying objects have appeared with great frequency in the same general perimeter of area. According to Sift's calculations the most frequently visit- ed area is near the community of -Baciu and it amounts to approximately forty hectares (almost 100 acres) of land. The UFO's usually appear to fly in an east to west direction. They have sev- eral shapes. And on many occasions the altitude they are seen at does not exceed a few hundred, meters. At greater .velocities these observed objects become enlarged and all the mass grows blurred--contoured--and is surrounded by a halo, appearing as an object of gelatine .(translucent)- like consistence. During their growth they have 12"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"a \"V\" shape whose top is always pointed in a westerly direction. At times these flying objects become barely perceptible. They remind us of atmospheric whirl- winds or of caloric turbulences, girded visible ones as seen on some summer days; however, they do appear on photoplates even in this state prom- inently contoured, revealing their true form and color and suggesting the same mass of gelatine- like consistence. Their flights have also been followed through polarized light filters and the objects did not disappear. To the question of do these \"extraterrestrial vehicles\" visit us alone or do they come accomp- anied by other fellows, the Cluj biologist gave the .following observation: \"In most instances the flying \"V\" appears alone, but as I told you the unknown objects assume not only this form. I have observed several times and did photograph objects of spherical form, bright ones resembling some glowing globes or sometimes on the contrary, pale, phantom-like almost invisible objects. In 1965 there appeared above the forest a pear-like- shaped object (see the photograph included). From this object three other transparent globes were detached, and then after this another seven smal- ler ones were detached from it. These smaller globes disappeared after a few seconds.\" What are the sizes of these objects? \"It was very difficult for me to take an exact measure- ment during their flights. I have observed them from various distances. I did take, however, .measurements at the landing place. Yes, the ob- jects,.not all of them for sure, I have seen did land and this .point does evidently constitute a most spectacular thing. I have watched the ob- jects in the moments when they, on approaching the ground, grew smaller, lost contours and be- came opaque. Once they were on the ground they took on a pyramid-like shape and their position at rest was always the same: the top directed north and the bottom directed south. I didn't have the courage in those moments to approach them. I did visit the landing places the day following these observations and found in the grass the imprints left by the unknown vehicle. I could thus correctly assume that the objects would have been of a triangular shape; the settl- ed and burnt grass confirmed this to me. That is, a body with the longer sides of 3.2. meters and the smaller side (the base) of 2.4. meters. The height, that is the distance from the ground to the upper surface of the object of approximately 1.8 meters. Also, it is important to note that no grass has ever grown again in that place where the object was resting.\" Did you record radio perturbations or magnetic derangements? \"Never, nor did I find the presence of any radioactivity. I did, instead, some ex- periments that force me to believe that these strange vehicles are propelled by nuclear energy. Several times I concealed in the landing areas photographic undeveloped films which were put in paraffinated boxes. After a few days I returned for these planted boxes and on the development of them, they presented themselves in a highly fog- ged state. I. then planted another system of \"trap\" boxes (again paraffinated), this time with semens of a fir tree, knowing that these would be highly sensitive to radiation (lethal dosage of 600-: 900 roentgen units). .I had the same surprise with the semens. Part of them were severely dam- aged. But this did not impress me as much as the branches of the trees and bushes nearby the land-, ing place that were burnt, as if someone had \"gentled\" them with the flame of a welding de- vice. This is not a made up tale as I invite you to see them for yourselves.\" So, the next day Liviu Timbus and Nicolae Savu of the editorial staff of \"Flacara\" went with Alexander Sift to visit the \"cosmodrou\" near the community of Baciu, where they observed for them- selves the strange markings and imprints left by \"astronautical craft.\" They also examined for themselves the trees that were burnt perhaps by a radioactive jet. It was all as biologist Sift had said it was in his account. Strange phenomena which come to decipher or, conversely, to deepen the mystery of the UFO's. For the present, this is how it stands. The Utah UFO Display' by Salisbury available Dr. Frank B. Salisbury's long-anticipated book, THE UTAH UFO DISPLAY: A Biologist's Report, was published in July. The introduction to the book is by Dr. J. Allen Hynek. Salisbury, biologist from Utah State Univer- sity presently on loan to the Atomic Energy com- mission, has produced a book from the point of view of a scientist. In his book, Salisbury builds his observations around the recorded ac- counts of those who have witnessed UFO's in the, Uintah Mountain Basin in his own state of Utah. These observations, starting in 1967, have con- tinued to this day. They have reportedly never before been published. Is it not logical, Salis- bury suggests, to assume that in a universe so vast and ageless, another planet somewhere is reaching out--and has touched Earth? Could it not be equally argued, he asks, that after all, our earth .is but an experimental station, and we, the creatures of some great universal plan— whirling through space and stretching our tiny minds to comprehend our environment and the great challenges of our time? One of the book's fea- tures is a series of drawings depicting the ap- \"pearance of the UFO's as described by the ordin- ary citizens of the Uintah Basin who have witt- nessed them and reported the sightings to one of their number, Junior Hicks, who '. has kept records. The 224-page book is available from Skylook or from the publisher, Devin Adair Co., 1 park Ave., Old Greenwich, Conn. 06870 J ._ The price is $7.95. 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"In Others' Words By Lucius The various weekly tabloids continue to feature UFO material of widely varying worth. The EN- QUIRER remains the most reliable of the lot; its issues for July 21 and 28 contained sighting re- ports from prison guards in Washington, the opinions of five prominent psychiatrists regard- ing contact with ET life, and (beginning in the July 28 issue) excerpts from Ralph § Judy Blum's excellent book, BEYOND EARTH. NATIONAL TATTLER featured UFO articles in the June 30, July 7 and July 21 issues. Reports from California and Texas were included. The June 30 NATIONAL INSIDER has an interview with Ralph fj Judy Blum which Ralph says they never gave, but he liked it anyway! In the \"probable fiction\" department, there is an article on animal mutilations and UFOs in the June 30 issue of NATIONAL NEWS EXTRA. Oh yes, the mutilations exist and the UFOs exist, but this \"eyewitness report\" sounds like something specifically designed to sell papers. The August issue of SAGA is not at hand as I . write this, but it is supposed to contain an art- icle on a possible link between \"Bigfoot\" and UFOs. (Editor's Note: The Saga.article includes a number of sightings investigated by Stan Gor- don, who comments that the article has \"a few errors,\" but is \"basically good.\") The May/June issue of SOUTHERN VOICES contained an article on the Pascagoula case, but it was largely repetition of familiar material. An interview with Josef Blumrich, author of THE SPACESHIPS OF EZEKIEL, may be found in the July/August issue of BEYOND REALITY, along with Hayden Hewes 1 regular \"UFO Report\" column. The August POLICE GAZETTE has a \"speculative rehash\" piece on UFOs which you can easily afford to pass up. August FATE reports on the Gallup Poll regard- ing UFOs, giving a bit of additional information on sightings by interviewees. Interviews with Erich von Daniken may be found in the August issues of VERTEX and PLAYBOY. The former is largely rehash, but the PLAYBOY inter- view makes some interesting points and is perhaps one of the better von Daniken interviews thus far. The planet Mars may or may not have any rela- tionship to UFOs, but I think most readers are also interested in astronomy, life on other planets, etc. Therefore, I would like to briefly mention three books on Mars which I find quite interesting. LIFE ON MARS? by Graham Berry is a very good introduction to \"Mars-ology\" for young- er readers, and the adults will also find some good material in it. In the main, Berry's book deals with the mission of Mariner 9 and a good many of the fascinating photos from that space Parish probe are included in the book. The price is $4.95 from: The Ward Ritchie Press, 3044 River- side Drive, Los Angeles, CA 90039. Perhaps the most detailed of the recent books dealing with the Red Planet is Martin Caidin's DESTINATION MARS (Doubleday § Co., Inc., 245 Park Avenue, N.Y., N.Y. 10017, $7.95). This volume gives con- siderable background information on previous Mar- tian studies, as well as presenting more recent data and photographs from the Mariner 6,7, and 9 probes. Material on certain Martian \"anomalies\" (such as brilliant flares seen by. astronomers). is included in the Caidin book. Photographs, maps and drawings of Mars are featured in a beautiful book by Patrick Moore § Charles A. Cross which is titled, simply, MARS. It has some of the same material to be found in the Berry and Caidin books, but also includes considerable additional data. It may be obtained for $7.95 from: Crown Publishers, Inc., 419 Park Avenue South, N.Y., N.Y. 10016. UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS OVER THE TENNESEE VALLEY is a very interesting summary of UFO events which have occurred in Giles County, Tenn., as well as in Northern Alabama. The book is written by W.A. Darbro (a space scientist at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.) and Stanley L. Ingram (a newspaper colum- nist for the Pulaski Citizen). We know there are certain areas where UFOs seem to congregate and are seen regularly by local citizens. Piedmont, Mo. is a good example. The area discussed by Darbro 5 Ingram seems to be another such site. Most of their discussions center on cases from 1972-73, although a few older reports are also detailed. As in other locations where UFO ac- tivity is high, there are reports of UFO land- ings and occupant sightings. The authors end their book with a summary of nation-wide reports from the autumn flap of 1973. Copies of the book may be obtained from Mr. Ingram at Box 377, Lewisburg, Tenn. 37091 for $2.50 each. The theories and research of the late Dr. Wil- helm Reich have always been the subject of much controversy. One of the more active and voci- ferous spokesmen for \"Reichian\" topics is Jerome Eden. In a previous book, ORGONE ENERGY, Eden briefly mentioned Reich's experiments involving UFOs. Now, in his new book, PLANET IN TROUBLE (sub-titled \"The UFO Assault on Earth\"), Eden goes into much more detail regarding what he and Reich both deemed the ultimate threat to life on our planet. UFOs use \"orgone\" for their propul- sion, Eden says, as well as throwing off a deadly exhaust of \"DOR,\" a highly toxic radioactive.

Washington object whines OLYMPIA, WASH., OLYMPIAN, April 8, • 1974--. Ladell Lund, Donna Widener, and Dorietta Widener reported the sighting of. a UFO the night of April 7 near Carpenter and . Homann roads. The girls said the cone-shaped, object hovered while emit- ting a high-pitched whine. The object reportedly had two headlights, four blue lights, and one blinking red light on the bottom. The witnesses said the object, which hovered over their car, was about the'-size of a small airplane, and had a pointed tip. English students report sighting 'LUTON, ENGLAND, EVENING POST, April 23, 1974-- A group of sixth-form students say they sighted two UFOs.

It was very low, about 50 to 100 feet, and cer- tainly not an aircraft,\" said Jackson. \"It went over the Caddington .area near the Ml. We were all quite excited and ran farther down the road when we saw another UFO. This one had three blinding white lights, and it made a series of complicated maneuvers before shooting off in the direction of Warden Hill. Not many people believe us, but this was no hoax. Five of us saw these objects very clearly.\" At Warden Hill, Luton, the youths reportedly spotted large scorch marks on the grass. \"There were large areas of scorched areas as though something had landed there,\" said Jackson. \"There were also lumps of black, clayish material lying around.\" At Luton Airport a spokesman said, \"What these youngsters could have seen was a light-aircraft flying over the area.\" UFO material for trade—I have many pho- tos, slides, clippings and books on UFOs that I will trade for similar UF.O material.

It was prepared and submitted by David A. Schroth of the Greater St. Louis UFO Study Group; SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) GUESTS: Astronaut Brigadier General James A. McDivitt; Congressman J. Edward Roush; Ralph and Judy Blum, authors of Beyond Earth: Man's Contact with UFOs. MODERATOR: Edwin Newman NEWMAN: »...Mr. Blum, what happened, in 1973?. R. BLUM: I guess it started the night of August 30th, when in 25 or 30 Georgia towns all over the state, police wires and sheriffs' lines began to be flooded with reports that people were seeing things over their, houses and over their fields. They were lights; sometimes they looked like objects. They were very upset, and a lot of people reported them. Hunter Air Force Base in Savannah had a report of two military police who claimed their car was driven off the road by a swooping, low-flying \"thing.\" Up in Tupelo, Mis- sissippi, some state troopers and forest rangers watched something the size of a house maneuvering --so they say--over their heads. What really hap- pened was a lot of policemen all over the coun- try, particularly in the South and in the West, reported seeing things, laid their.jobs on the line. And then on the llth, I believe, of Oct- ober, two men in Pascagoula, Mississippi, claimed thay they were floated aboard a UFO while they were fishing along the Pascagoula River one night --they just meant to go fishing. And one of them, six months later, is still under medical care. What.happened, we still don't know. NEWMAN: One of\" them was named Hickson, and the other was named Parker. Which one is still under medical care, by the way? R! BLUM: It's Parker— NEWMAN: General McDivitt, you spoke to Hick- son?  •\"'..\".' McDIVITT: -Yes, I did. . . . NEWMAN: How soon after this allegedly hap- pened? ' . McDIVITT: Oh, it was probably a month, or-,sp afterwards. But I was really convinced. I think Charles Hickson is telling the truth, as he knows it. He's really not the type of guy who goes out and looks for publicity or anything. NEWMAN: What do you mean by, \"as he knows it\"? McDIVITT: Well,- I don't know whether that really happened or not, and I guess I wouldn't Ralph and Judy Blum know unless I were actually there. But I think that what he says happened, he's convinced really happened. And as far as I can tell, there's nothing to disprove the fact that it didn't. NEWMAN: Is there anything to prove that it did? McDIVITT: I guess there's Charles Hickson. And I don't mean that to be facetious. There are a lot of indications that people see things. If I walked out on the street and saw an acci- dent', I'd be able to report it and everybody would consider me to be a good witness. If I saw a . UFO or a flying saucer or something—as soon as you say something like that, people no longer really believe you. That's kind of a problem. NEWMAN!:. What details did he give? McDIVITT: He said he was fishing, he heard this thing, he saw this thing—which he assumed was a spacecraft--land. Some people come out, pick him up, float him back into the spacecraft, examine him, then take him back out again. NEWMAN: Did they have pointed ears? McDIVITT: Well, as a matter of fact they had two things that came out like this (illustrates) and something that came out like this. Now, there might be some other form of communicating; like a radar system or a—you know, just because we see in the visible range of light and we hear noises --other people can communicate other ways, I'm sure. - NEWMAN: Congressman Roush, did you come to any conclusions after your congressional hearings in 1968? ROUSH: There was the inescapable conclusion that we were experiencing a phenomenon, or we were experiencing phenomena, which needed ex- plaining by people of scientific minds who could convince the American people what this was. We don't know what it was—I think that had to be the conclusion of our hearings. I should point out that we did not have a bunch of Jcooks at this hearing. We had six of the nation's outstanding 16"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"scientists testifying before the committee and participating in this symposium. : -NEWMAN: .Now was that the end of this -as far-- ROUSH: That was the end of it as far as Con- gress was -concerned, yes. There have been no other hearings on this subject, to my knowledge, since'that time in 1968. NEWMAN: Well that's the end of it so far as Congress is concerned, but if this is a matter for scientific substantiation, Congress wouldn't be much involved in it anyway. Is any other part of the government doing anything? ROUSH: You're wrong when you say that this-- (laughter) NEWMAN: Am I wrong? I may well be--it happens. I could see I was wrong when I said— ROUSH: Yes. You see, my own thought is this: that we don't know what this is, but we should find out. I don't know that we should go down to Mississippi and investigate that. And I don't know that we should investigate the flying object that Governor Gilligan saw, or my friend Con- gressman Hilles saw, or that James McDivitt saw. But I do think that the Congress does have the responsibility of funding basic scientific re- search, which might lead to an answer for this problem and many others. And we do that, by fund- ing the National Aeronautics and Space Adminis- tration in its basic research, and that's re- search that private people can't do. We fund the National Science Foundation in their basic re- search, and that is very important. It's impor- tant for us to know about the atmosphere— •NEWMAN:-. Is any research going on now into un- identified flying objects? ROUSH: Not as such. But it seems to me there is research which is related, and perhaps will someday explain this phenomenon which we are ex- periencing. It leads us to other questions, such as extraterrestrial life. Viking is to land on Mars in 1976— .   , R. BLUM: July 4th. ROUSH: --on July 4th, yes, that's right, and this is, of course, during our bicentennial cele- bration. And one of the purposes is to determine whether or not there is some form of life on Mars —which, again, might lead to an explanation of life on other planets. NEWMAN: July 4th, 1976, may bring up a sore point with Mrs. Blum, who is from England, but-- (laughter) NEWMAN: --In any event, is there any research being done in this field in England? Is there any experience there? J. BLUM: I think the situation there is exac- tly the same as here. A friend of mine's grand- father, Air Marshall Borton, told me that the British Air Ministry's files on UFOs are quite phenomenal. But they've never disclosed anything about them. In fact, the only countries who've come right out and acknowledged that UFOs do really exist are Brazil and France--especially France, where I think it was February of this year, after a . tremendous wave of sightings in France and northern Italy—when, incidentally, I gather that two UFOs landed on Normandy beaches. g. BLUM: (laughing) Isn't that nice? J. BLUM: The French, being the realists-they are, have now issued forms to their gendarmes, and said, \"Do not attack any of these little fel- lows.\" Now there may be no little fellows. There may be nothing we:know as real, and looking for evidence seems to be the hardest part of the game, because I don't think we're ever going to have any real evidence, and that's what's hard on scientists. NEWMAN: You don't think we're ever going to have-any real evidence? R; BLUM: No. I've finally come to that con- clusion, Ed. I finally agree with you. NEWMAN: Really.  . .- . J. BLUM: No, I don't agree on that. R. BLUM: I think we.'11 never have (garbled) evidence. I think what it is is beyond us. McDIVITT: I hope that someday we have the knack of communicating with these people so that, really, we can talk to them. I hope that before I die I get a chance to really meet one of these guys;   • (light laughter) J. BLUM: Me,, too. - NEWMAN: Okay\", we'll be back to talk to you about that. (commercial) . '•-'_' NEWMAN: Ralph Blum said;he thought we would never have any contact with extraterrestrial life, people from other planets. You didn't agree, Jim. McDIVITT: No. I think that they're really a- round, and I hope that someday--maybe not in this decade, or maybe not even in this century or the next century--but someday, I hope that we can communicate. We're not very smart as a group of people, you know. We've only been around a few thousand years, and earth is a few billion years old, so we've'got a'long ways to go. NEWMAN: What did you.see, or what do you think you ..saw, .when you were--was it Gemini 4? McDIVITT: Yes. Well I didn't see anything that a--something like an upper stage of a rocket or something. It was a long, cylindrical object with a long pole sticking out. But it was a very precise object. It wasn't a— NEWMAN: Could it have been the upper stage of a rocket that we put up there?

It wasn't a Russian one. (emphati- cally) It wasn't any other country's, because we know where they all are. NEWMAN: Have you thought much about this-- what this, could be: .1 mean, you talk about life on other planets.

McDIVITT: Not predictable, but I hope that eventually we will. NEWMAN: Congressman Roush, your hearings were set off, to some extent, by something that hap- pened in England? ROUSH: To some extent, yes. I had a little problem in getting approval for the hearings— NEWMAN: You mean because money would be in- volved? ROUSH: No, no. Simply because it seemed rather foolish. (laughter) ROUSH: About that time, Sir Bernard Level1, who runs Jodrell Bank in England—and they have a large dish there, a tracking dish-- NEWMW: The observatory. ROUSH: --that's right. (He) began to receive signals which seemed to have some pattern to them, and some people interpreted this as signals from some other planet, and got excited about it. Well, this was enough to excite my chairman, and he have approval for the symposium, which was conducted. NEWMAN: Ralph Blum, you wanted to say some- thing. R. BLUM: I wanted to back up and correct my- self. I didn't say, or mean, .that we'd never have contact. I say we may never have physical evidence, because I think something--we're having experience already, we're already having contact. NEWMAN: I wanted to ask you about that. Why do you think we will never have physical — if you believe that there are such things as UFOs, uni- dentified flying objects, then you surely believe that someday they will become identified flying objects. R. BLUM: No. NEWMAN: You don't believe that. R. BLUM: No, I think what happens is—I think even the way we talk about their coming here--I mean, it's been a year now that we've been im- mersed in this subject, and we didn't want it. We didn't go out looking for this subject—it sort of fell on us. I think the way they travel isn't across space, the way Jim was travelling and the way we travel. .1 think they drop in from--there may be a lot of other three-dimensional places a- round. I don't think there's any fourth dimen- sion,, because I think to have a universe you've got to have three dimensions, and that's all it'll take. And maybe something drops in from somewhere else—drops in across from where they come from. And maybe they aren't physical. A man like Leakey discovers a new skull in Africa, and by transmitting a hologram, that skull can appear in three-dimensional form in the Museum of Natur- al History in New York and be measured with cali- pers, without ever leaving Africa. We are on our way towards physical transmission of objects. NEWMAN: So you believe we will have contact with them, but it won't be physical contact. J. BLUM: I think there may be more than one kind of flying saucer. I mean, there may be what Ralph is talking about, and maybe also, if some civilization is just 200 years ahead of us, they would be using—what? Nuclear fission? Fusion? McDIVITT: Sure. Fantastic types of propul- sion systems, and other things. I don't think we're really smart enough in the 1970s to really understand what's going to happen in 2300, or some other time like that, and these people could be way ahead of us. ROUSH: Well, John Dewey spoke of \"audacious imagination which has led to great scientific discoveries.\" And that's what we're experiencing right now, and it's what science has to exper- ience- -this \"audacious imagination.\" It's been this quality in the American people that has made us the outstanding technological and scientific nation in the world. We are willing to suffer, and experience this audacious imagination. NEWMAN: I'm going to give you a question and ask you for a one-word answer. Has enough hap- pened since your last hearings to warrant more hearings, Congressman Roush? ROUSH: If it costs money, no. (laughter) NEWMAN: Thank you, one and all. Policeman, others chase UFO ROCHESTER, MINN., POST-BULLETIN, FEB. 20, 1974 --A Rochester policeman and a service station operator were among several persons who report- edly saw a UFO Feb. 19 in northwest Rochester. James Kuhlman, who operates a Clark Service station, was driving his wrecker past the Hill- crest shopping center about 11:25 p.m. when he saw the object \"flying at about 100 feet, towards me. I was really terrified when I first saw i\"t.\" He said he pulled his truck into the shopping center and parked. Kuhlman described the UFO as bigger than a wrecker truck with a \"kind of white dome shell on top.\" He said it seemed to be powered by what looked like several small after- burners flaming from the bottom. \"It cruised slowly right over my head in a northeasterly di- rection,\" said Kuhlman, who gave chase in his truck. He was joined in the \"chase by Patrolman James Preiss in a squad car, who had spotted the object as he drove north on U.S. 52. \"Whatever it was,\" Preiss told the police dispatcher, \"it was seen to have flames coming from it.\" The control tower at Rochester Municipal Air- port said nothing strange was seen in the sky at the time, and nothing was tracked on radar. 18"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"UFOs created in laboratory Editor's Note; The following scientific experiment may account for some \"light in the sky\" sightings, thus taking its place among other possible explanations, such as plasma, hoaxes, space animals, meteorites, deterioration of satellites, fireballs, bal- loons, planes, swamp gas, etc. It does not appear to explain lighted portholes, radar tracking, speeds of thousands of miles per hour, evasive tactics, etc. The experiment is a positive step in moving toward an ex- planation of the UFO .phenomena, however, and provides yet another possible explanation which the serious UFO researcher will want to consider in analysing a given sighting. By Wes Lefler University of North Carolina CHAPEL HILL--The director of Morehead Plane- tarium here doesn't have to look into the night sky for his \"flying saucers.\" He can make them in his private laboratory.- \"Ours are not UFO's,\" he says, \"because we-can identify ours. But our laboratory models may partly explain the recent flurry of UFO (Unidentified Flying Object) sight- ings.\" \". You name the shape you want and he can make it ....saucer, cigar, diffuse blob. And using various gases one might^possibly custom mix the colors... red, blue, green, yellow. With a four-foot-long glass tube, gas (air) and electricity, A. F. Jen- zano can produce the \"saucers\" in singles or in fleets. He can make them hover or.blaze out in a flash of colorful light. --. v Jenzano came up with the laboratory \"appari- • tions\" when he saw a correlation between them and the reported UFO sightings. With the same equip- ment he explains the Northern Lights. Jenzano fires a high-voltage charge through a partial vacuum inside a five-inch-diameter glass tube to create the \"apparitions.\" This electrical charge excites particles of air (gas) inside the tube which glow and form in various shapes depending on how much air and electricity is fed into the tube. \"I believe something like this is what,UFO observers are seeing rather than space ships from another world,\" Jenzano says. He explains that static electricity may ac- cumulate in the air above the earth throughout the year. But he says that these particles in our air are more highly electrified during March and September when the earth is over the more dense sunspot region of the sun. In the early spring the earth, which has been warmed all day by the sun, rapidly disperses heat into the air, often creating areas of momentary low pressure, Jenzano says. \"It is in these areas of low pres- sure that apparitions might appear just prior to This pocket of glowing gas might pass for a UFO (unidentified flying object) if it were not in-, side Morehead Planetarium's giant test tube. ' The man at the controls can make it \"hover\" or he can make it streak away. He can even fire the gaseous \"flying saucers\" out in fleets. He can vary,their colors. A. F. Jenzano, director of the.Planetar- ium, came up with the idea in an attempt to ex- plain what he believes some UFO sighters are see- ing in the night skies. being occupied by air from an adjoining high pressure area,\" he explains. \"What we actually see is excited (electromagnetically charged) air that glows because it is at low pressure in a single, moving pocket.\" The degree to which this pocket of air is evac- uated, combined wi^th the amount of electricity present, controls the brightness of the appari- tion's glow. The color depends on, the type of gas in the pocket like the various colors a- chieved in neon tubes. And the shape and size depend on the vacuum packet's shape and size._ Jenzano explained that apparitions appear only when a delicate balance is achieved; the condi- tion of the air, the electrical charge present and the prevailing gas in the air at the-time has to be \"just right.\" \"These gases 'are usually waste material from homes, autos, industrial plants or a combination of these,\" Jenzano says. Why do some of these apparitions hover? And why do some streak out of sight v at high rates of speed? \"Based on our experiments with the tube,\" Jenzar.o says, \"if the air is 'static' the ap- parition (pocket of glowing gas) will hover. Vi- olent atmospheric conditions will cause it to streak away out of sight.\" Jenzano doesn't claim to have all the answers. \"At this jpoint our -explanation is about as scien- tifically imaginative as three-dimensional flying saucers are fictionally imaginative,\" he says.

The June SKYLOOK rang many bells. NICAP had dozens of cases similar to the Dec. 13 Bradenton, Fla., photo case with \"artifacts\" which high- lights continuing problems of investigation. To play the devil's advocate: one teenage witness, \"brilliant\" and bored, photo with no reference points clipped from the full roll, knowledgable amateur photographer. Not to prejudge, but all the elements of a hoax are present and this hy- pothesis must be considered. Three \"credential- carrying agents.\" Question No. 1: what did the credentials say? The \"slag\" rocks, unless they yield a strange chemistry, will provide ambiquous evidence at best, and the film apparently cannot be analyzed meaningfully. Certainly the alleged 2nd witness should be sought, and Thrush's personality in- vestigated. As I pointed out in The UFO Evidence, an unsupported photo must be considered no more valid than the credibility of the witness, which often remains a question-mark. Ted Phillips continues to do valuable scien- tific work gathering physical evidence at alleged UFO landing sites; well worthwhile even if they prove to be duds. A few noteworthy past UFO land- ing indentation cases are: 5/5/64 near Comstock, Minn., with a 3-foot crater and small indenta- tions; 9/5/64 Glassboro, N.J., crater case (See U.F.O. Investigator, Vol. II No. 12); and 8/19/65 Cherry Creek, N.Y. (See Strange Effects from UFOs, p. 42-43). . The projected beams of light (apparently) in the Oct. 29, 1973, Austria case (\"like snail feelers\") have many interesting partial paral- lels. A brief compilation of light beam cases is included in Appendix D of UFOs: A New Look. Not included there is the downward projected beam in the famous 4/17/66 Ravenna, Ohio, case. Although I can't retrieve the exact reference, I recall Jim McDonald talking about a case in Australia involving \"bent\" car headlight beams in the presence of a UFO. The advertising plane that produced a \"saucer\" illusion April 9 near St. Louis reminded me of an identical experience a few years back in Wheaton; Md. My heart jumped into my throat when, for a brief moment, I thought I was seeing a UFO des- cending to land nearby. The illusion was very startling, but the identification shortly there- after as an ad plane was definite. NICAP used to check the logs of the companies flying such planes, usually seen enroute from a fringe air- port to a shopping center area where the message usually is distinct only when the plane is low and directly overhead. The moving message lights viewed from the side produce the \"rotating UFO windows.\" The small planes used often cannot be heard until nearby. Their slow motion and lack of UFO-like behavior usually is the clue. They look but don't act like UFOs. The following used books are available at this time.
