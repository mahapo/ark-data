Weather: Temperature high-70's, sky overcast, no precipitation. Witnesses: Robbert v/d Broeke (from 1st floor kitchen); Nancy Talbott (from 2nd floor bedroom) Crop: String-beans (1-1/2' to 2' tall, and mature) By Nancy Talbott O n Aug. 8, 2001,1 arrived at the v/d Broeke home in southern Holland to begin a two-week research project in conjunction with U.S. parapsychologist Dr. Wil- liam Roll and the Parapsychological Services Institute, Inc. Dr. Roll, whose work with recurrent spontaneous psychokinesis (RSPK) phenomena had led him to ques- tion whether there might be a human consciousness el- ement involved in the crop circle process (similar to that documented by him in multiple poltergeist and haunting cases), wanted to gather geomagnetic and electromag- netic data at the v/d Broeke home and at recent crop circle sites when Robbert v/d Broeke had had pre-cog- nitive intuitions of their arrival. For my first ten days in Holland, Robbert and I visited several formations in the area which had occurred prior to my arrival, gathering the baseline data which Dr. Roll's protocol required. During the nights we bicycled out to the fields with the night-vision camcorder and several flash cameras in order to carry out photographic experi- ments. For years Robbert has been taking flash photos at night inside crop circles which, when developed, show single or multiple strange semi-opaque orbs and other light phenomena not usually visible to the naked eye. He has found that such experiments are most productive in new crop circles, but that-in some cases-unusual lights/orbs can be photographed even weeks or months after the initial event. More recently Robbert has discovered that he can ac- About the author Nancy Talbott of BLT Research Team, Inc. is one of the foremost crop circle researchers in the world. She has worked closely in the past few years with Wil- liam C. Levengood in gathering crop and soil samples from various countries and subjecting them to scientific analy- sis. This research strongly indicated that most crop circles are not hoaxes. More recently, Nancy has incorpo- rated BLT, received some reseach funds, and is involved with a very prom- Nancy Talbott ising soil study. This research has, among other things, shown that Levengood's plant data (increased stem node- lengths in the crop circle plants, among other things) cor- relates at the 99% level of confidence with increased clay- mineral crystallinity in the soil. Additional research has been completed which further backs up the previous studies. Papers detailing this latest research are expected to be available in the spring.

Talbott tually see quite a few of these light objects before they are photographed and has also noted that many of the objects now being caught on film are not only much brighter and more dense, but are much more complex in structure. I, too, seem to have become more sensitive to the presence of the objects, often seeing brief flashes of light which-when I can get off a shot or two in their direction quickly enough-result in the objects apparently being caught on film. On the night of Aug. 20-21, 2001, Robbert and I had decided not to go into the fields and were at his parents' home. Mr. and Mrs. v/d Broeke had retired to their bed- room on the first floor at the front of the house at around 11:30 p.m. Robbert's younger sister, Madelon, had gone to her bedroom on the second floor at the back of the house around this time also, leaving only Robbert and me in the kitchen downstairs. The kitchen window was open and provided a view over the 80'-long back garden, at the end of which is a chain-link fence and a 4'-deep trench which.runs along the edge of the farm field immediately beyond. By 3 a.m. Robbert and I had been in the kitchen dis- cussing the crop circles, their possible causative mecha- nisms and origins, what they might mean, etc. for several hours. I was tired from weeks of tromping about the fields during the days recording data, and then nights of flash photography and videography, and realized that I felt pretty much like I was-or might have been-chasing my tail. I recalled my first visit with Robbert and his family back in 1998 and the incredibly dramatic light display I had witnessed with Mr. and Mrs. v/d Broeke on my sec- ond night in the house. And I thought about all of the other really peculiar incidents on return trips, occurring with increasing frequehcy-and all of the work that has been done to document and attempt to understand these events-and it suddenly seemed to me that the phenom- enon was just too complex, too elusive, too difficult to study. ' I suppose partly out of fatigue and partly out of frus- tration I decided to go up to bed, after telling Robbert that I was tired of all this \"pussy-footing\" around and asking, \"Why can't this phenomenon be more obvious, more direct?\" I was sleeping in Robbert's old bedroom which is on the second floor at the back of the house, overlooking the garden and farm field. . . The bed is placed so that it faces directly out through two floor-to-ceiling glass doors which go out to a small balcony overlooking the garden and farm field beyond, and there are thin, gauzy curtains hanging at these glass doors. The farm field is clearly visible from the bed. Robbert was still in the kitchen downstairs. I pulled the curtains closed (leaving one of the doors open), changed into my nightgown, and propped myself up with pillows to read in bed for awhile. The lights were on, and the room was well lit. At about 3:05 a.m. I heard a few cattle nearby bawling raucously, as cattle do when they are disturbed. From years of talking whth farmers and ranchers who have had crop circles (and other unusual events) occur on their properties, I immediately realized that this bawling might be a sign that something strange was afoot, and in the back of my mind thought, \"I should go to the windows and pull back the curtains because I might see some- thing.\" Whether because of fatigue or some sort of intu- ition, I stayed in bed and did not pull back the curtains. The cattle quieted down for a few minutes, but at about 3:10 a.m. they started up again. And again I thought I should go to the windows and open up the curtains....and, again, I stayed put (in my notes from that night I have written that I was \"scared\"). After a minute or so the cattle were quiet again. Then, at about 3:15 a.m., a brilliant, intense white col- umn, or tube, of light-about 8 inches to 1 foot in diameter from my vantage point-flashed down from the sky to the ground, illuminating my bedroom and the sky as brilliantly as if from helicopter searchlights. My room was so bright I can't, in retrospect, understand how I could so very clearly see the \"tube\" of light outside-it's distinct edges-but I could for about a full second, and there seemed to be a slight bluish tinge along the sides of the tube. Then this tube of light disappeared, and both my room and the outside went dark. While the tube of light was there, it was so bright I couldn't see exactly where it was touching down and wasn't sure how close it was. Ap- Page4 MUFON UFO Journal January 2002"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Top photo shows crop circle as viewed from second floor of the v/d Broeke home. Bottom photo is a closer view of the formaton. proximately one second of total darkness elapsed and then a second tube of the same brilliant white light, slightly edged in a bluish tint, appeared just to the left of where the first tube had been. Again the room and the outside lit up spec- tacularly, somehow leaving the intense tube of light clearly visible for about one second. Then, after another second's darkness, the third and final tube decended to the ground. There was no sound at any time during the light inci- dent (the neighbor's cattle were now quiet), nor did I smell anything out of the ordinary at all. There was also no physi- cal sensation of exposure to increased electromagnetic energy (such as the tingling Ihad experienced a few years prior in this same house during an earlier encounter). The entire light display took 5-6 seconds. If the bawling cattle are considered to be part of this situation the total time would be about 10 minutes. By the time the third tube of light flashed down to the ground I was half out of bed yelling to Robbert, who was still downstairs in the kitchen. He, at the same time, was running up the stairs to get me, having witnessed the event from the first-floor kitchen windows. From the kitchen he could see that the tubes of light had hit the bean-field, just beyond the fence at the back of the garden, and he re- ported also that the sky had lit up like daylight when each column of light had occurred. He, however, had seen only two tubes of light, appar- ently because he had jumped up after the second one, leaving the kitchen to come and get me upstairs. He fur- ther indicated in the drawing he made immediately after- ward that these tubes of light were spiraling down to the ground. Actually, when I got out the drawing I had made shortly afterwards, I had also indicated a spiraling motion inside the tubes of light. Robbert had perceived the tubes of light as being smaller in diameter than I had, but he also saw them as definite, contained columns which remaind the same width all the way down. Neither of us saw anything in the overcast sky from which these tubes of light had originated. Later that night Robbert reported that he had heard the dog next door barking furiously just prior to the appearance of the light- tubes. Our yelling back and forth to each other up the stair- way had awakened both Madelon and Mrs. v/d Broeke, both of whom emerged into the hallway in excited states. Robbert and I were equally agitated, due to our shared impression of the stunning force of the energy involved....and our mutual, clear, impression of it's pur- posefulness. All four of us went immediately to the glass doors at the back of the house off the dining room (directly un- derneath my bedroom's doors) somewhat timidly, not certain of what else we might expect. Looking out these glass doors we could see nothing up in the sky, and after a minute or so Robbert went to the back door off the kitchen and stepped out; I joined him and, tentatively, also went outside. So far as we could tell, everything seemed oddly normal and very dark-looking up we could see only an overcast sky. We headed for the back fence and the farm field, and there, just over the fence about 15ft. into the bean field- just barely visible in the darkness-was a new crop circle. When we turned my flashlight onto the field we could see that half of the crop in the downed area was laid away from us, and the other half was laid toward us, and I thought I could faintly see steam rising from the freshly downed beans (which I attributed to the interaction of the tubes of light with a heavy night-time dew covering the crop). At dawn the next day, from my bed, I could clearly see the new circle-which turned but to be, in fact, an ellipse of about 35 ft. in length (running East/West) and 20ft. in width (North/South diameter), with a 20-ft.-long pathway adjoining the northern edge which ended in a «*tf January 2002 MUFON UFO Journal PageS"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"crossbar (like the capital letter \"T\"). The epicenter of the ellipse was considerably west of the actual center, and the northern half of the stringbean plants (heavy with beans) were swept counter-clockwise in what looked to be one wide sweep all the way around the ellipse and back along the southern edge. The eastern and western edges or the ellipse were slightly squared, ending abruptly at a row of beans on either side and leaving the plants in these rows along the edges totally unaffected. The pathway off to the North was laid away from the ellipse to its end, the crowbar at the end being laid left (west) and right (east) in simple single sweeps. The width of all the pathways was one row of beans only, about 18 inches wide. We were unable to go into the field until the evening, due to the need to obtain permission from the farmer and also due to our lack of a ladder to help us negotiate the fence and the steep ditch on the other side. On the evening of the 21st, at about 6 p.m., we did go in and carried out a number of procedures. . The compass showed no deviations within the laid crop (nor at control locations outside the new event), and the electromagnetometer registered a steady 0.2m, the same reading I obtained at the control locations and at all of the other crop circle sites I had tested in the past two weeks. No EM spikes were noted. Examination of the plants showed them all to have been bent over at the base, and no broken or split stems were seen. There was no visible trauma to the stems or leaves, or the very healthy- looking beans beneath them. The soil appeared relatively dry both inside and outside the laid-crop area, and was fine-grained and dark in ap- pearance (mineralogical characterization of the soil in this field a year previously by BLT Inc.'s consulting mineralogist, Dr. Sam lyengar, had indicated that this field is very well maintained and high in organic content and very low in clays). Measurements and photographs were taken, and a vis- ible difference in leaf color inside the downed-crop areas was observed to be due to the fact that some of the plants were laid toward us showing us only the tops of the leaves, thus reflecting the light differently. Along this flow- line near the center of the formation, plants growing im- mediately next to each other were cleanly bent over at their bases in opposite directions, with no visible damage to either the plants or the beans. There was a slight swirling of the plants in the \"epicen- ter\" area which, in this case, occurred in the southeastern quadrant, considerably away from the actual geometric center of the ellipse. Because of the hoof-and-mouth disease which has been prevalent in Holland (as well as in other eastern European countries) during the summer of 2001, and the subsequent likelihood that US customs would not allow importation of either plants or soils from Europe into the U.S., no attempt was made to take soil or plant samples. I did, however, harvest a few handfuls of beans and enjoyned them at dinner a few night later. So far, I've noted no ill effects. That night, following our routine examination of the new formation, Robbert and a friend and I went back over the fence and into the field to take night flash photos. Be- cause the ellipse was not yet 24 hours old we anticipated getting some strange light orbs and/or objects on film, and we were not disappointed. Every roll of film (4 or 5) produced numerous photos of light orbs, usually fairly close to one of the three of us. Some of the light objects were quite large (4-5 times larger than a soccer ball) nearly transparent orbs; some were much smaller (about grapefruit-sized) and more dense, and appeared to be relatively high over our heads. In many of the more interesting photos these much denser, brighter objects were down close to the crop surface or just over our heads. Interestingly, a number of photos taken of the forma- tion by leaning over the fence (10-15 ft. away from the downed-crop) very shortly after it had formed showed no photographic, anomalies at all. I shot only about half a roll of film immediately after the ellipse had occurred, mostly because it was so dark and I wasn't sure that the flash was reaching the new circle; perhaps if I had shot more flim I might have gotten one. Now, however, I am wondering if it may be the pres- ence of people inside the formation, the presence of some part of the human energy field, perhaps in interaction with residual energies from the formation event, which has something to do with producing these light anoma- lies. In future studies we will have to try photographing new circles from outside them, before any people have been inside the flattened areas. In preparation for one new BLT, Inc. study, which will .evaluate the effects of various energies on normal (non-corp-circle) plants and soils, I have had many dis- cussions with microwave and laser experts who are con- vinced that the crop circles and at least some of the as- sociated light phenomena are simply either \"mistakes\" by the military and/or industrial research community and/ or perhaps pranks by one or another of these groups on the citizenry. If they are \"mistakes\" it would seem-particularly in light of the recent ghastly events in New York, Washing- ton, D.C and Pennsylvania-thai we are all in more trouble than was immediately apparent. And the idea that they might be pranks strikes me as perhaps even more fright- ening, and for the same reason: idiots at the helm is hardly a comforting image. What I suspect, instead, is that these highly trained and proficient microwave/laser engineers just aren't really \"tracking\" the available facts yet-like the majority, it seems, of the rest of the population. On the other hand, in recent conversation with one of the new scientists participating in ongoing BLT, Inc. stud- ies, a man highly regarded by his academic colleagues, the idea that we are instead perhaps dealing with a \"new kind of energy,\" something not seen before, has been discussed. I suspect this idea is much more reflec- tive of reality than is the notion of an inept or adolescent military/industrial research group gone amuck. Was the occurrence of this crop circle related to my frustration over the elusiveness of the phenomenon and my wanting a more obvious indication of the agency in- volved? It did occur within 10-15 minutes of my having Page 6 MUFON UFO Journal January 2002"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"stated my disgust, and it did occur in the closest growing plants (stringbeans-the first time a circle has been re- ported in this crop) to my physical self, the whole inci- dent clearly visible from the very bed I was sleeping in. It was also placed dead-center between the north and south boundary lines of the v/d Broeke property and about as close to their perimeter fence as possible. Robbert and I, from our slightly different vantage points, were each quite convinced of both the intense power and the precision of the light \"tubes\"-both of us perceiving the incident as \"deliberate, on purpose.\" Are our perceptions, not just of this current event, but of mul- tiple crop circle experiences over many years, simply anthropocentric? What are the chances that this recent amazing dis- play was just coincidental? And if it was, why have simi- lar events-the crop circles and all the stunning light phenomena associated with them-been occurring for the last 25-30 years with increasing frequency and complexity all over the world? And why repeatedly in fairly precise locations? Why don't they occur everywhere? Robbert and I don't know. What we suspect is that the answers to these questions-in fact the actual pursuit of these answers-will greatly affect human awareness.

Human-like ufonauts reported in many countries By Scott Corrales Some early UFO cases involving occupants, such as those in the '50s and '60s, involved more often than not creatures that resembled human beings in most respects. The more notorious \"contactee\" experiences provided a wealth of god-like, fair-haired saucernauts claiming to be our kindly elder brothers from outer space, visiting Earth to show us the error of our ways. In the Grey-and-Reptoid-haunted 1980's, 1990's, and today, it is almost heretical to suggest that any other pos- sible form of occupant can emerge from a UFO. But hu- man ufonauts remain an intriguing part of the picture, and their very existence has suggested very disturbing possi- bilities to certain investigators. In 1967, South American UFO researcher Luis Anglada Font, an ex-WW II fighter pilot and former intelligence operative, published a well-written compilation of U.S. and European cases entitled \"La Realidad Ovni Atraves de los Siglos\" (\"UFOs Throughout the Centuries\"), in which he turned his military man's eye upon a problem that distressed him greatly: he had no doubt as to the fact that UFOs and their occupants were real, but what was to be made of the humans who are often seen aboard UFOs or involved in some sort of activity with the ufonauts? Anglada stated in his book: \"They come to our planet from satellites forming a stepladder in space, stealthily- with some exceptions-covering the Earth at amazing speeds....! get the impression that they know us better than we think, and I believe that they have a 'fifth column' that moves among us, and this is one of the factors that con- cerns me.\" What exactly is a \"fifth column\"? Simply stated, it is any group that secretly sympathizes with an enemy, aiding and abetting their cause in ways that range from espio- nage to terrorism. Anglada's thesis was that UFOs were far from being sanguine, and that their ultimate goal was the subversion of humankind, although perhaps by not as blunt a method as outright hostility. This group of underminers would be humans in league with the ufonauts and sympathetic to their ultimate aims. We know more about the phenomenon than we did back in 1967, to be sure, and the paragraph from Anglada's book could easily be dismissed as cold war paranoia. Certainly, even Dr. Olavo Fontes, APROs Brazilian consultant and the key researcher of the Villas-Boas case, believed in a \"military\" objective to UFO activity, regarding the infa- mous attack on the Itaipu garrison (1965) as the opening round in a massive UFO invasion of Northern Brazil 1 . But in 1989, Spanish UFO investigator J.J. Benjtez investigated a case which took place in the south of Spain January 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"involving the materialization of two large, brilliant figures that turned into human beings before the eyes of fright- ened teenagers. The \"humans\" were a male and female, dressed in street clothes appropriate for the time and place. They calmly walked along the beach and vanished into a crowd, while a UFO display filled the heavens above. The witnesses stuck around to see them return hours later, capturing with a Super-8 camera their unusual manner of walking 2 . The trail of footprints left by the male and fe- male led straight into the water. The incident caused the researcher to give his book, in which this case was featured, an ironic name: La Quinta Columna (The Fifth Column). The evidence presented by Luis Anglada in his argument was based on the myste- rious disappearances of humans and \"breeding experi- ments,\" such as those in the Villas-Boas case. Humans were being abducted in order to breed an \"in- vasion force\" that would be human and acclimated to the alien's home planet. He suggested that not all the force would consist of conscripts-some would be youthful vol- unteers, who, attracted by the prospect of adventure, would choose to throw their lot in with the ufonauts. Despite the \"space opera\" ring that such a claim leaves in our ears, the truth is that humans have been reported in some landmark cases. In September, 1972, a driver near the town of Palenque in the Dominican Re- public was flagged down by a trio of aliens in grey form- fitting uniforms and with lemon-hued skins. An egg-shaped UFO was in the background, and the driver became un- derstandably concerned for his safety. One of the aliens approached him and engaged him in perfect Spanish, telling him that he had once been as hu- man as he was, having been rescued by the aliens from nearly drowning in the high seas ten years previously. His human name had been Freddy Miller, and he had suc- cessfully adapted to living on the aliens' homeworld. Jacques Vallee mentions a case in his book Dimen- sions which occurred in Temple, OK, in 1966. A flight instructor saw a brilliant machine parked on a shoulder on the interstate, got out of his car to take a snapshot of it, and noticed a \"man in military fatigues...a plain old G.I. mechanic\"carrying out repairs on the wingless, tapered fuselage. It had no visible means of propulsion, yet it took off vertically at an astounding speed. 3 Spanish researcher Benjtez mentions another road- side encounter, this one in November of 1974 outside Huesca, Spain. It involved a couple who stopped their car to have a bizarre conversation with a pointy-faced, all- too-human ufonaut. who asked a surprising question of the motorists: could they lend him a monkey wrench? A semi-spherical UFO with alternating red, yellow, and white lights hovered in the background, and the driver wondered what good would a wrench do aboard such a vehicle. The ufonaut introduced himself as the former \"Dr. Flor, from Barcelona.\" In 1980, private plane owner Jos Antonio Pagan dis- appeared while flying from Santo Domingo to Puerto Rico. He sent out a frantic mayday in the darkness: his plane was being dragged off course by a \"weird light.\" A Boeing (Continued on Page 9) Editor's Note Among the interesting cases noted in this article is that of Frederick Valentich, 20, who disappeared Oct. 21,1978, while piloting a single-engine Cessna 182 aircraft between Victoria, Australia, and King Island (across the Bass Strait). Following are the pertinent details of the case, which features a sighting, engine malfunction, and radio failure. Just after 7 p.m. Valentich radioed Melbourne Air Flight Service (MAPS): Valentich: \"Is there any known traffic in my area be- low 5,000 feet?\" MAPS: \"Negative. No known traffic.\" Valentich: \"Seems to be a large aircraft below 5,000 feet.\" MAPS: \"What type of aircraft?\" Valentich: I cannot confirm.

What is your altitude?\" Valentich: \"4,500 feet.\" MAPS: \"Conirm you cannot identify aircraft?\" Valentich: \"Affirmative.\" Three minutes later, Valentich again contacts MAFS: Valentich: \"Aircraft...It's not an aircraft. It's\" [break in transmission.] MAFS: \"Can you describe aircraft?\" Valentich: \"It's flying past. It has a long shape. Can- not identify more than that...coming for me right now. It seems to be stationary. I'm orbiting, and the thing is or r biting on top of me. It has a green light and sort of metal- lic light on the outside.\" He then reported that the object had vanished. MAFS: \"Confirm it has vanished?\" Valentich: \"Affirmative. Do you know what sort of aircraft I've got? Is it military?\" MAFS: \"No military traffic in the area.\" At 7:12 p.m. Valentich reported, \"Engine is rough idling and coughing.\" MAPS: \"What are your intentions?\" Valentich: \"Proceeding King Island. Unknown air- craft now hovering on top of me.\" MAFS: \"Acknowledge.\" Valentich: \"Delta Sierra Juliet [Valentich's call sign] Melbourne...\" This final transmission was followed by 17 seconds of a loud metallic sound. An extensive search of Bass'Strait failed to turn up any trace of Vallenich or the aircraft. There were a number of UFO sightings reported on that date, at least 15 of which have remained unexplained. There had also been several reports earlier in the year. In 1944 a Beufort bomber crew reported a \"dark shadow\" flying within 100 feet of their plane for 18 to 20 minutes, causing radio and ADF malfunction before zoom- ing away at three times the speed of the bomber.

Months later, his mother reportedly saw Jos Antonio in a vision one afternoon: he was wearing a metallic green uniform with black metal boots, and told her that he had joined the \"extraterrestrials\" in their mission and was quite safe and very happy with his new life. Perhaps even more alarming is a case investigated by Spanish researcher Manuel Carballal. According to the testimony of a number of witnesses, a young man who identified himself as Frederick Valentich, the Aus- tralian pilot who disappeared mysteriously in 1978, was alive and well in 1990 at Plaza del Charco, a seaport square on the island of Tenerife in the Canary Islands. Displaying an Australian passport to prove his claim, Valentich told those with whom he spoke on several oc- casions that he now belonged to a group of humans who had been \"recruited\" by extraterrestrials. It is also worth noting that the supposed Valentich showed no signs of aging, and resembled the photos circulated around the time of his disappearance at the age of 20. A group of nine Puerto Rican UFO watchers ascended to the heights of El Yunque Rainforest in October 1974 in hopes of seeing the elusive phenomenon. The singular experience they had on the evening in question, however, took place at ground level. Heriberto Ramos, a researcher and the group's leader, recently stated in a radio interview that at the time of their overnight stay in the jungle peak, there were no com- mercially available flashlights that would last an entire evening, so the group's lighting issued from an ingenious PVC tube containing an auto headlight and a car battery. As the hopeful saucer watchers ascended the trail, they were surprised to see three human beings coming down from the mountain top in their direction. The three humans-two males and a female-had an uncanny resemblance to one another and were clad in nondescript uniforms. There appeared to be nothing .\"alien\" about the threesome, who spoke Spanish and claimed to be from a local community, until one of the group members noticed a puzzling detail-the uniformed trio were utilizing an improvised lighting source that re- sembled their own in every respect. Photos taken of the trio revealed haze-shrouded im- ages upon being developed. Their images, however, could be made out clearly on infrared film. This peculiarity, Ramos reasoned, was probably the reason that the pic- tures and other UFO related materials were stolen from his office by unknown interests. There are many more cases in which humans-not hu- manoids or human-looking aliens-have been seen oper- ating in conjunction with clearly nonhuman types, ranging from \"Greys\" to tall, god-like blonds. Although his argu- ment was couched in military terms, could there be the slightest bit of validity to Luis Anglada's fears of a \"fifth column\"? The answer is a cautious \"yes.\" Charles Fort toyed with the notion of \"certain esoteric ones\" being in contact with nonhuman forces since the dawn of history in the pages of his Book of the Damned. Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier suggested the. existence of the \"Nine Unknown Men\" in their Le Matin de Magiciens, who would be beings of our own world in contact with higher powers. Could some of the human \"crewmembers\" be the descendants of those who were forcibly abducted in the past? There is an extensive tradition of people who were kidnapped \"from above\" in human history-Elijah; Romulus, the founder of Rome; and a host of unnamed ones-combined with the many thousands that disappear every year without a trace 4 . If these alien-born humans have the power, obviously, to return to Earth, what keeps them from staying? Perhaps they fear the reprisals of their alien masters, or the loss of certain faculties (\"pow- ers,\" so to speak) that they may have developed or ac- quired on other worlds. Perhaps they have been thor- oughly \"brainwashed\" and no longer see Earthbound hu- manity as kin. Anglada offers a more ominous possibility: these UFO- related humans (as well as the \"offspring\" of our con- temporary abductees, resulting from the breeding experi- ments to which they are allegedly subjected) could well be our replacements on this planet, after our own race is annihilated either by design or accident. In his militaristic scenario, these hybrid humans would be returned to Earth as our overlords or taskmasters: much more alien than human in custom, training and choice. The genetic experiments being visited upon unsuspect- ing humans worldwide (the Mirassol case in Brazil, for instance) reinforce the above mentioned possibility. But what do the very human collaborators stand to benefit from it all? Power, influence or status in the real \"new world order\"? It remains anyone's guess. Endnotes: 'Lorenzen, Jim and Coral.

Uncle Ralph's story raises questions, few answers By Virgil Staff Karolyn Grazon (pseudonym), who resided in Oakland, C A, was an electrocardiogram technician, a friend of the family, and a credible and superior lady. Karolyn knew of my interest in ufology and, in fact, possessed much the same interest. When Karolyn was a young girl, she had eagerly listened to a story from her Uncle Ralph Scheibly concerning an event he had experienced in what she later presumed to have been either Arizona, or, more probably, New Mexico. This story would have been told to Karolyn inl947or!948. On March 16,1989,1 informed Leonard Stringfield of Karolyn's story, and this was recorded in Stringfield's Sta- tus Report VI of July, 1991, page 69. Stanton T. Friedman was also provided with an interview tape and he immedi- ately began researching the details and whereabouts of individuals who might have worked with Scheibly. On May 4, 1991, Friedman requested that Karolyn be regressed, and this regression took place in my living room on the evening of Aug. 2, 1991, with Dr. Richard Haines performing the regression. The regression turned up a few significant differences from what Karolyn had re- called. So that in the area where this new record is dis- similar to the Stringfield report, the dissimilarity arises from new information based on the regression. Scheibly, Karolyn's uncle by marriage, was a foreman and later superintendent, for the Raymond Concrete Pile Company. It is known that he was warmly respected by his men, and that he was a man of solid integrity and goodwill. Scheibly was bom on May 17, 1903, and died on Oct. 26, 1963. He had lived in Hayward, California. The regression, performed in Berkeley, began with Karolyn sitting at a table with her Uncle Ralph. To para- phrase, she inquires if she can ask him something. Uncle Ralph then asks what she would like to know, and she replies that \"I have heard about people from other places, or stars, and I would like to know if you know anything about this.\" Uncle Ralph is quiet for a long time, but then contin- ues: \"Well, Sugar, I'm going to tell you something. I haven't told other people. Remember last summer when I was gone away? One morning we were assembling our work at the job site. We had a big pile driver machine located in the midst of a big, flat plain. The fellows were busy put- ting things together when all of a sudden it was like the orange sun was coming up, and then it was like the sun^- brilliant and bright-as in the middle of the day. There was then a big explosion over the long, flat ground. At a slightly tapered hill, something brilliant was burning. \"The men were stunned and scared, and they all looked at each other.\" They then climbed into their trucks and headed out towards the brilliant, burning sun. It was a long way over the land to this place and the site of the great explosion was like a gentle hill area.\" When they arrived there was lots of smoke over a huge area, and the heat was intense. Ralph called to see if anyone was hurt, but there was no answer. The area was full of fire and smoke and hissing, and as the smoke began to clear, there appeared an immense circular metal surface. The craft had crashed on one side, and it was not ah airplane. Lying on the ground were two bodies. There were broken parts where these little people fell out. Ralph very slowly walked towards the very small beings. The men tried to approach the bodies, but could not because of the incredible heat. \"They were very small people and did not look like us,\" said Ralph. \"The people who saw this were stunned. One of the little people moved.\" At this time there was no more fire, but the heat was intense. One of the small beings waved his left hand. In time the authorities appeared. There were sirens, fire engines, and a large array of military vehicles. Other civilians had arrived, and these were pushed back by men in uniform who would not let the civilians close enough to see what was happening. Ralph and his men repeatedly mentioned that there were living beings in the wreckage, but they were ordered to \"never mind.\" Prior to Ralph and his men being hustled off by what Karolyn beljeves was the United States Army, they watched one or more beings taken away in an ambulance. Ralph and his men were driven to a base and held incommunicado in or near a huge hanger where they, at some point in time, watched the hauling in of wreckage by huge military vehicles. It is not known how long the men were held in custody, but they were split up and que- ried, and then informed that they had not seen anything. They were told they had not seen any little men, and that this was just an experiment. The men were separately told what they had seen, and what they had not seen, and Ralph finally concluded that if he was ever going to get out of there, he would need to play along with their game. Finally he was informed that he had better not tell. Back at the job, no one talked for a time. Eventually they began to laugh and talk, and concluded that in the future they would not talk about what they had seen. But all were very angry. Ralph told Karolyn: \"Balls! I know what I saw ... Those damn fools-to think they thought they could pull the wool over our eyes. I was there. You can believe it or not. Please don't tell this story. If the wrong people found out, they could hurt your Uncle Ralph.\" Ralph informed Karolyn that something shortly ap- peared in the newspaper, and the report was that it had been a military test: that they had exploded something out there. Prior to the end of the regression, it seemed important to determine the date of events just chronicled.

When an abduction occurs, are there measurable changes in the environment that will confirm that an abduction occurred and, perhaps, help us understand the forces behind these events? We each have our beliefs about what is causing people to report abduction experiences, ranging from aliens, ex- tra-dimensional beings, to odd psychological conditions or sleep paralysis, but it has been very difficult to get defini- tive evidence for any particular theory. Some investigators over the years have attempted to use a video camera in the bedrooms of abductees to ob- tain physical proof of an abduction event. These efforts, though, have met with little documented success. Environmental traces? If abductions are, at least in some instances, physically real, then we would expect that those beings doing the abductions would leave some trace in the environment. Even if super-aliens have the ability to transfer a person through a bedroom wall to a waiting UFO, that doesn't imply that the environment in the bedroom would be un- affected while the transfer was occurring. Based on this assumption, the UFO Research Coali- tion (composed of MUFON, the Fund for UFO Research, and the Center for UFO Studies) decided several years ago to initiate a research project to monitor the potential physical changes associated with an abduction event. Our working hypothesis is that some physical changes must occur during a real abduction event (although we are un- certain as to exactly what these might be). The official name of the project is the Ambient Moni- toring Project, or AMP for short. Specifically, we have constructed a device that is placed in the home of an abductee and left there for about 4-6 months. The device is small and attractive, about as big as a woman's makeup case, designed to blend into the home. It records various physical parameters and stores the information, which is then downloaded to the computer of our project engineer (Tom Deuley, a longtime MUFON official) every day. While the device is in her home, the abductee keeps a daily journal of experiences related to the abduction phe- nomenon. Then, when the data collection period is over, the journal will be matched up to the physical data to see what was recorded at those times when a person thinks that she may have been abducted, or something similarly odd occurred. A cooperative venture The project officially began in the spring of 1998. Those most involved with the project include Rob Swiatek from the Fund, myself from CUFOS, and Tom Deuley. AMP started with the development of two prototype devices, used in three pilot cases. From this experience, we con- structed the final monitoring device, which was used for the first case in the summer of 2000. As of this writing, we consider the project a success: we have successfully collected data from several abductees with few technical problems. This project would not have been possible without the assistance of some very supportive abduction investigators and, most impor- tant, some generous and cooperative abductees and their spouses and family. We thank them profusely. Identities protected The identities of those involved will be protected and kept confidential, per normal scientific ethics that man- date how to deal with human subjects. We are following standard research protocols in this project in every pos- sible respect. This includes the recording and analysis of the data. Our project engineer, who collects the data, has no idea what is recorded in the journal by the abductees. And the abductees and UFO investigators are not told what the device has recorded. The data will be archived and later, when the project has ended, be compared and correlated to determine what can be learned. We follow this protocol-which means that there are no results yet to report in this article-because it is crucial in the study of anomalies to design rigorous research that removes any chance to alter the data to fit some precon- ceived notion. As we know, there are skeptics and de- bunkers who are only too happy to find deficiencies, real or imagined, in any serious research project. The results of AMP, whether positive or not, will po- tentially be quite important for ufology. Obtaining physi- cal confirmation of an abduction event would be an im- portant advance in our study of UFOs. Finding no physi- cal evidence of abduction events would be open to sev- eral interpretations, but it would be just as important. Volunteers needed We are always searching for additional abductees willing to volunteer for this project, and that is where you can help. We need investigators who know of abductees who might want to participate, and we need abductees who are willing to be a part of this study. There are no costs involved, as our research grant is sufficient to cover such things as a second phone line, which is necessary in some homes. If you are interested in volunteering to participate or help with this research, please let us know as soon as you can.

It is true that most LITS reports can be easily explained away, usually as aircraft lights or astronomical bodies such as bright stars and planets. But there is a small residue of such LITS reports that are not so easily explained. These often haunt certain geographical areas such as the Pennine Hills in Northern England; Marfa, TX, in the USA; and Hessdalen in central Norway. It was the LITS in Hessdalen that attracted the attention of UFO research- ers from Norway and Sweden in the early 1980s, and since then many others from around the world. The Hessdalen LITS were the first to be subjected to scientific scrutiny using a whole host of hi-tech equip- ment. Hessdalen really was the scene of \"Science vs. The UFO.\" Hessdalen is a valley in central Norway, lying south- east of Trondheim and about 30 kilometres northwest of the town of Roros. The whole valley stretches 12 kilometres in length and has only around 200 inhabitants. The valley is special for one very unusual thing: mysterious lights. The first appearance In December, 1981, unknown lights suddenly started to appear in the skies above Hessdalen. These lights could sometimes stand still for more than an hour. They were also seen to move around slowly before stopping, and sometimes they were observed travelling at a fast rate of speed. At one time the lights were tracked on radar and were estimated to be travelling as fast as approximately 8,500 meters per second. These lights were observed just about everywhere, and more often than not they were below the horizon down in the valley and not high up in the sky. It has to be said that the vast majority of the lights were reported to be below the tops of nearby mountains. No one in Hessdalen could offer an explanation for these strange lights. The shapes of the lights The lights themselves appeared to have several differ- ent shapes. This was something that became quite appar- About the author Philip Mantle is the former Director of Investigations for the British UFO Research Association (BUFORA) and was the MUFON Representative for England.

The main shapes were bullet shaped, with the sharp end down; a round football shape; and an upside down Christmas tree shape. There were other shapes, but the above three were the main ones. The colors The colors of the lights were mostly white or a yellow/ white. Sometimes a small red light could be seen amongst the white. On a few occasions the lights were made up of every color in the rainbow. The lights could be observed several times a day, but they were seen more during the night. At the most they were observed four times a day. There were more reports of the lights in the winter than the summer. One reason for this might be the fact that in summer Hessdalen has almost perpetual daylight. Three groups The lights could be split into three groups: 1. Small and strong white or blue flashes which could show up everywhere in the sky. 2. Yellow or yellow/white lights. These lights were more often than not observed in the valley and below the hori- zon. Sometimes they were just above the rooftops and even down on the ground. They could appear stationary for more than an hour before slowly moving off around the valley, and sometimes they could show extremely fast acceleration and very fast speeds. 3. Several lights together at a fixed distance from each other. Mostly these were yellow or yellow/white lights Page 12 MUFON UFO Journal January 2002"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"with a red light at the front. These lights could move,slowly around the tops of the mountains:  ~ Continued sightings '.' . The.reports of the strange lights carried ori throughout 1982, but suddenly in the spring of 1983 sightirigsrof them dropped .rapidly. By the summer of 1983 there were no reports of the lights at all. However, in the autumn and winter of 1983 the sightings began again, but in far fewer numbers than before. Things changed somewhat in the Autumn of 1984 as the sightings began once more to increase. As no official institute with governmental support in Norway seemed to be interested in these strange lights, five individual re- searchers began their own research project: Project Hessdalen. Their aim was simple-to discover what the lights in Hessdalen were. The project consisted of a work- ing committee which had the responsibility of running the project, and an advisory committee as an expert group to help the working committee in the theoretical part of the project. Project Hessdalen begins Project Hessdalen managed to obtain good contacts in a number of institutions in Norway, including the Norwe- gian Defence Research Establishment, the University of Oslo, the University of Bergen and also the University of Trondheim. Some of the Project's team had made con- tact with these establishments in the past in the course of other research. The UFO research groups of both UFO Norway and UFO Sweden along with many volunteers began their field studies of the Hessdalen lights in January, 1984. A wide variety of sophisticated instrumentation was to be used in order to try to identify the unknown lights. Such instrumentation included a battery of cameras, radar, spec- trum analyser, geiger counter, and much more. No sooner had the field study began in snow-bound Hessdalen valley than the project began to see some ac- tion. On Jan. 27, 1984, the lights were seen by project members and on radar. At 5:32 p.m. an oblong-shaped light was observed moving oyer the mountains and out of sight. The light had a white and red color which blinked at uneven intervals.  \\ On Jan. 28 at 3:49 pm something was detected on ra- dar, but nothing was seen with the naked eye. On Jan. 29 there was again an echo on the radar, but again nothing was seen by the eyes of the gathered observers. On Feb. 1 numerous radar returns were made, but again the lights remained elusive to the ground observers. Later that night an oblong-shaped light was observed by 11 people, and it was also photographed. Throughout the remainder of the project numerous observations of the lights would be made, and they were photographed on many occasions. Instrumentation The instruments used for the project were many and varied. They included: A camera with a special filter which could be used to analyse the light spectrum. A seismograph was used to measure any movements in the Earth's crust, just in case the lights were related to small earthquakes. None were One of the Hessdalen lights. Some of the photo equipment. registered. Radar recordings totalled 36. three of which coincided with observations made by the project observ- ers. Two photos of the radar screen were taken depicting the returns. The project also used a spectrum analyser connected to an antenna so that all radio signals could be monitored on a screen. At no time did this instrument pick up any- thing unusual. A magnetometer was used to measure any variations in the Earth's magnetic field. There was none. A laser was pointed at the lights a total of nine times. Eight out of the nine times the lights seemed to respond to the laser by altering the way they were flashing. Geiger counters were used to measure any radiation, but nothing unusual was recorded. An infrared viewer was also used, but on the two occasions when the lights were observed using this instrument there was no infrared radiation vis- ible. The camera was probably the most effective of all the instruments used, and dozens of color photographs were taken. Those taken by using a long exposure showed the January 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"round or oval lights. -All the cameras were tripod mounted to reduce blurring. The lights were photographed in the sky, just above the mountain tops, and of course down in the Hessdalen valley itself. Computer analysis of some of .the photographs was inconclusive. '.'..'  UFO laboratory A-similar exercise was attempted again in the winter of 1985, but due to. extremely bad weather conditions it was not possible to repeat the success of the 1984 project. An American UFO researcher, the late Dr. J. Allen Hynek, who was at one time a consultant to the U.S. Air Force, visited the 1985 Hessdalen project. It was to be one of his last field trips before he died later that same year. Dr. Hynek described the project as \"a UFO labora- tory\" and was extremely impressed by the results of the 1984 project and of the efforts of all those involved.\" Since that time Project Hessdalen has been discussed and debated in many countries around the world. The lights, although still there, are not in such profusion as they were in 1984. Some equipment still monitors the area, and the researchers involved still hope to set up camp in the Hessdalen valley once again should the lights return in large numbers. It has been speculated that the strange lights could be related to some kind of weather phenomenon, or to lights produced by faults in the earth's crust termed \"earthlights.\" Some believe that a solid structure lies behind the lights, but no one knows for sure what they are. Still unidentified In the spring of 1994'a group of 20 scientists attended a workshop in Hessdalen which lasted for four days. These included Professor Boris Smirno.v from the Institute of High Temperatures in Moscow, Russia; Professor David Fryberger from the Stanford Linear Accelerator in the USA; and Professor Yoshi Othsuki from Waseda Uni- versity in Japan. All agreed that the Hessdalen lights were \"real\" and not illusions of any kind, and that they were worthy of further scientific study. UFOs had been pro- moted into the scientific premier league. UK-based researcher Paul Devereux, who is part of the Project Hessdalen consultancy team and was at the four-day workshop in 1994, continues to work closely with Project Hessdalen leader Erling Strand. Both have ven- tured far and wide to research similar types of light phe- nomenon in other parts of the world. Today, 17 years after UFO Norway and UFO Swe- den joined forces to complete one of the most complete scientific study of UFOs conducted by any civilian UFO group, sightings are still being reported. The local resi- dents still regularly report sightings direct to UFO Nor- way. Local people have reported both lights-in-the-sky and apparent structured, cigar-shaped UFOs. Recent sightings (year 2001) include a report by F. Moen 6n April 13. In a valley west of Hessdalen his son observed a fast moving light for over 20 minutes. Through- out the'sighting the light continued to change color as it movedrabout the sky. Earlier in the year, on March 28, Tor Gaserud was driving towards the town of Roros when he observed a Page 14 MUFON UFO Journal blue-green light close to the mountain ridge. The light was observed for around 20 seconds. Right at the beginning of the year Peder Gronas and his grandson Bjarne Lillevold were driving towards Hessdalen when they observed a bright light just above the mountain. Whatever these LITS are, they continue to be observed in and around the Hessdalen region as these few sightings clearly show. Continuing international research In August 2000 and 2001 Italian astrophysicists joined their Norwegian counterparts in a joint study of the phe- nomenon. Again a whole battery of equipment was used as part of this study, including radio spectrum analysers, still cameras, video cameras, and spectroscopes. The head of the Italian team is Massimo Teodorani, Ph.D., an astrophysicist from Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche in Bologna, Italy. The Italian Committee for Project Hessdalen financed his project. In an interview with re- searcher Linda Moulton Howe, Teodorani concluded that the Hessdalen lights are \"thermal plasmas of unknown origin.\" This full interview can be viewed on the web site at: http://earthfiles.com/earth301.htm Automatic measurement station Equipment still monitoring the Hessdalen valley in- cludes an Automatic Measurement Station (AMS). This is a video camera linked to a video recorder and a com : puter system. The camera takes photos at regular inter- vals, but it is also triggered if a light source appears. An improved AMS is on the drawing board, but funds are required to upgrade the equipment already there. When such plans can be accomplished is solely dependent on how much money can be raised from sponsors. The main sponsor today has been Ostfold University College in Norway. Further plans for Project Hessdalen include: Expand the Automatic Measurement Station. Develop and run a database, with a web interface. Analyse data and begin the necessary acrivities to find the answers to the Hessdalen Phenomena. Develop a small AMS that can be installed in other places with high UFO activity. Funds inadequate Project Hessdalen is run mainly on a voluntary basis, with individuals spending their own time and money to try and resolve the puzzle of the Hessdalen lights. The AMS requires further equipment, and without funding it is un- likely to be up-graded in the near future. More informa- tion on Project Hessdalen can be found on the web site: www.hessdalen.org Interview One of the leading researchers for UFO Norway and Project Hessdalen is Odd-Gunnar Roed from Tonsberg in southern Norway. I caught up with Roed in Norway in August, 2001, and what follows is an extract from a much longer interview: Philip Mantle (PM): What part did you play in the Project Hessdalen team?    , Odd-Gunnr Roed (OCR): My title was Project Co- ordinator. Mostly I was responsible for the results of our January2002"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"research being distributed to people in Norway and around the world. I prepared a bulletin which was distributed to selected scientists and large UFO groups. PM: Have you witnessed the Hessdalen lights your- self? OGR: Yes, I have. In 1984 during the project in Janu- ary, everyone attending could see the lights. You could almost set your watch to the phenomena. For several weeks the lights appeared almost every two hours around the clock. I saw the typical orange-red light travel through the valley from south to north, and I also observed a rare sight which appeared like a dozen flash bulbs going off for one and a half seconds and then nothing, and then the same thing happened a little further to the north. PM: What do you believe causes the Hessdalen lights? OGR: Well that is almost an impossible question to answer. First these lights appear intelligent, then on the other hand they don't appear to be that intelligent as they are travelling through this remote valley doing absolutely nothing. We never witnessed anything of a structured nature, only lights. However, the local people have re- ported close encounter type cases and close-up UFO sightings of cigar-shaped objects. We have had the lights react to us. For example, we decided to turn off our instrumentation, and the sightings increased. When we decided to turn it back on again the sightings decreased. So you can see, it is very difficult to answer this question, but I would go as far as to call these lights an intelligent natural phenomena. PM: Do you think that science will find an answer to the Hessdalen lights, or will they remain unidentified? OGR: I think that science will find an answer. The question comes down to money. If we remove the term UFO and go down the route of trying to locate a new form of energy, then companies from around the world will undoubtedly come on board. These lights could open up a new avenue of physics, and we have had scientists from the USA and Russia comment on the lights, and have ruled out conventional explanations such as ball light- ning. The world of science must continue to study these lights without a doubt. PM: Do you believe that Project Hessdalen has ob- tained enough evidence to prove the existence of such an anomalous phenomena to the scientific community? OGR: Yes and no. We have several hundred photo- graphs that baffle scientists to begin with. A number of these have been computer analysed and some of these showed that the lights illuminated the landscape beneath, and we have regular photos taken by automatic field sta- tion there. Erling Strand of Project Hessdalen is the brains behind this, and it really is worth a visit to our web site to see all these photos and more. PM: UFO research in Norway is not just about Project Hessdalen, so what other significant cases are there in Norway? OGR: Like most countries there are a lot to choose from. We had an interesting two weeks in November, 1981, in Arendal. If you look farther south in Norway we had 30 witnesses observe a \"necklace\" of lights in be- tween the islands. It looked like a large ship all lit up. It The \"flying dust bin\" UFO. went on and off several times. Other lights seem to land in the sea, and a purple light illuminated the seas from underneath. There were also two searchlight-like beams pointing inland, but they did not seem to cast any shad- ows. PM: What is the most baffling UFO case that you have personally investigated? OGR: In the mountains of central Norway in 1991 I was shown a picture from a newspaper showing some strange marks in the snow. Apparently there were seven friends taking a vacation over the Easter period, and they were staying in a cabin above the snowline. They ob- served this large orange circle of light with a red light underneath. It floated around in the air before it actually touched the ground three times, all the while illuminating the snow. The next day they all went to investigate the area, and they located three marks in the snow. They were circles within circles, forming a triangular pattern. They were about 50 cm in diameter, and there was a yellowish-brownish color to them as well. About two weeks later one of the witnesses took me to the site. I took samples from the marks, within the marks, and one from about 215 meters away. We had the samples analysed at a college, and they stated that the control sample was fine, the sample between the marks was just about normal, but the sample from the marks was completely sterile. They suggested that this could have been caused by radiation. Our geiger counter showed no adverse radiation readings, so we were completely at a loss to explain it. PM: Are there any interesting UFO photos? OGR: We have one taken by an elderly lady in 1983 of a \"flying dust bin.\" The negative was originally sent to the authorities here, who \"lost\" it. The lady in question saw the object and photographed it, and it looks like a flying dust bin with a light on it. PM: What cooperation, if any, have you had from the Norwegian military? OGR: We have had quite good co-operation with them with Project Hessdalen, so we can only compliment them. I believe they checked us out first just to make sure we were not a bunch of fanatics, but in Hessdalen they helped us a great deal.

Close sighting reported in Italy PADUA — The Monselice Case occurred on the evening of Aug. 3.2001, at about 11:15 p.m. Two women sitting on a bench in a square observed an enormous four- sided object descend from the sky. It made no noise and stopped a few meters above the ground directly over the witnesses. The object, measuring side-on ap- proximately 10 meters in length, had rounded edges and many lights. At the structure's center, there was a ring of intense light, with a little red light in the middle. One of the women fled in terror and hid behind a small statue of the Ma- donna, while the other remained paralyzed on the bench. Suddenly, she rose and took a few steps for- ward, until she was directly beneath the object: She gestured strangely with her arms and made some noises. Her friend continued to call to her, screaming and fi- nally convincing her friend to join her behind the statue. After a few seconds, the strange metallic platform, with a kind of \"muffled noise,\" eventually split up into three parts, which then shot away at an incredible speed-two luminous discs in one direction, one multicolored, one in the other. Their screams caught the attention of another woman who caught sight only of the two frightened witnesses. A third witness, who was 500 meters away, saw a \"stupen- dous and intensely colored\" square-shaped object, which she stopped to watch for its \"extremely beautiful colors: white, red, yellow and green.\" The two protagonists of the story remained greatly unsettled from their experience: one of them didn't sleep at night for a week or more, and remained in a state of shock and speechless. An inquiry was conducted by the Carabinieri, and the case was picked up by various ufologists who issued varied and contrasting statements. The Pordenonese Antonio Chiumiento affirmed that it had to do with an extraterrestrial object which was going to attempt to abduct one of the two women, but the Inter- national UFO Center maintained that the cause likely was a top-secret American airplane. The Venice contingent of the National UFO Center finally reported its detection of a slight trace of radioactivity at the spot, leading to alarm among the population and the intervention of the Regional Environmental Protection Agency, which alter- nately refuted the presence of any radioactivity. -// Gazzettino, Padua edition and 77 Mattino di Padova, 17-30 August; Ufoltalia, 23-30 August; collabo- ration by Roberto Labanti, Matteo Leone, Alessandro Lue, Dario Paganini and Gildo Persone. Flying triangles in Tennessee MEMPHIS — The witness reports, \"I was on my way to work, traveling eastbound on Winchester Road on Nov. 2,2001, just outside of the Memphis city limits. There was low cloud cover covering the sun at 5 a.m. I noticed a long, black object traveling south at high speed beneath the clouds. The object was traveling far faster than any flock of geese could fly. \"There appeared to be a black 'smudge' behind the object. I at first thought this might be a black vapor trail, but the 'smudge' seemed to move in tandem with the object, biit didn't linger in the sky. As we got closer I saw an acute triangular shape with blurred indistinct edges. It moved across the sky at high speed and was out of sight within seconds. \"I'm a professional with two college degrees and skywatch planes regularly at Memphis International Air- port. I've never seen anything to compare with what I saw this morning.\" Two weeks later (Nov. 14) a flying triangle was spot- ted by the same witness. He says, \"Leaving for work at 5:28 a.m., I stopped to pick up the newspaper in our drive- way. A definite and very well defined dark lengthy shadow flitted across the driveway. There was no sound associ- ated with the passing of this shadow. The shadow startled me, so I jumped into my car instead of picking up the paper. \"My first impression was that something huge had flown beneath the streetlight and cast the shadow. This expla- nation was quickly discarded due to the physical impossi- bility of such an event, but I was puzzled by what I saw. It appeared that our cat had been startled as well by the passing shadow because she ducked for cover under a hedge. \"At 5:35 a.m., an hour before sunrise, and I am travel- ing east on Winchester Road, going to work early to com- plete a project. The usual Fed Ex jets are flying past on their flight paths to Memphis Airport. When I passed the Nike plant, I noticed a 'plane' that seemed much lower than normal for this part of the landing pattern. It defi- nitely caught my attention. \"It appeared to be hovering in place at a spot just east of the Nike plant on the north side of Winchester Road. This area is about five miles away from my home. I slowed down and came almost to a stop to get a better look at the 'plane.' It was my perception that it was not moving at all. \"As I studied it, I realized that there was no strobe light on it. It also did not cast its lights ahead of it, as you would normally expect to see the lights of a jet beamed Page 16 MUFON UFO Journal January 2002"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"straight ahead. Instead there were three white lights aimed downward. It was then that I perceived that I was look- ing at a triangular-shaped craft with three bright white lights, one at each corner, and a single red light in the middle of the underside of the craft. \"The craft was the size of a fifty-cent piece held at arm's length and a quarter to a half-mile away, hovering in place. It seemed to be hovering over an empty field. I got quite a good look at it for a period of time-I would estimate as long as two minutes. I continued heading slowly eastward until I lost sight of the object as I passed some trees. \"It was then that I resolved to make a quick U-turn, go back, and get another look. I found a place about two blocks farther on to turn around, and I raced back to look at the object again. There was no trace of it whatsoever! I searched the sky for several minutes in vain. The ob- ject had quite simply vanished. This craft was lower than the passing jets, and the lights appeared to be of a differ- ent intensity.\" Thanks to NUFORCwww.ufocenter.com Chevron shape in Tennessee AUGUSTA — On Nov. 19, 2001, the witness reports seeing a chevron-shaped object move from the north to south at 5:30 a.m., saying, \"Its movement caught my eye. It had a 'V'-shaped bank of white lights the same color as the stars. The rear lights seemed to be offset a little. It had no aircraft type of lighting on it and made no sound. \"The lights were perfectly round, like domes. I could not see any shape, but the V shape pattern of the lights. I have seen this type of object on many of the UFO shows.\" Thanks to NUFORC www.ufocenter.com Strange lights in Kentucky RIBOLT — On Nov. 15, 2001, at 5:55 p.m. a MUFON member reports seeing a very bright orange light with what appeared to be four refraction lines radi- ating from it, similar to the headlight of an airliner. A second identical light appeared to the left and slightly up from the first. It appeared as if two planes were in ex- treme proximity to each other. \"We stopped the truck (expecting to see a plane crash),\" says the witness, \"and I opened the truck door and looked right at the two lights, and then saw four to six more iden- tical lights appear in succession to the left and below the second light, almost evenly spaced and forming a semi circle as the last one or two lights appeared heading back to the right. \"The light positions remained static, with no change or movement, and the lights remained steady with no flick- ering. As I grabbed my camera, all of the lights disap- peared. The lights were much bigger and brighter than any star, and we saw several airplanes as we continued our trip, and none of the plane lights remotely resembled what we saw. \"A friend said she saw similar lights at her farm in the far southeastern part of this county about a month ago and she was relieved that we saw what we did. There was no sound.\" Bronze-colored object in Minnesota MAPLEWOOD — The witness reports he saw five figures in a formation soar on Nov. 19, 2001. They were bronze in color, and elliptical in shape. Their sides came to a point, rather than being just rounded. All looked to be the same size. The formation they were flying was simi- lar to a \"less than\" sign (<). Says the witness, \"They were traveling towards the southeast at 11:45 p.m. and, being a pilot myself, I would estimate around 40,000 feet. The sky was clear. I watched them from about a 60-degree sky position from my right side, to about a 30-degree sky position on my left side. They flew virtually overhead. \"I saw no other lights, nothing flashing, just the steady bronze color. I heard no sounds from them, but at that altitude you probably wouldn't. There were no trailing streams of light coming from them. I know the Leonid meteor shower has been going on, but with meteor show- ers, the light goes extremely fast, has a trail of light, and is generally really bright. These lights could not be mete- ors. \"There is not a great amount of military aircraft around here. The objects I saw were traveling three times as fast as an airliner in cruise. I'm not sure how fast our military aircraft can go, but it was impressive, whatever it was.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport NUFORC Oregon objects split PORTLAND — The witness was driving home when he saw two objects just after sunset on Nov. 19, 2001. At first, they appeared to be airplanes, although they seemed to be joined together and form one large hovering craft. The witness estimated they were flying at 2000 feet alti- tude as they passed at 5:15 p.m. Then, after about ten minutes, they split again. One advanced northward, and the other remained in a hover mode, perhaps advancing slightly northward. The witness states, \"I then saw a very small light leave the remaining craft, and it fluttered downward erratically, kind of like a spark. As I arrived home, this second craft advanced forward again, and I noticed it was shaped some- what like a plane, but all the lighting was white and steady. There were no blinking red and greens that are normally seen on the wing and tail sections of a plane. \"As I watched it slowly move northward, it appeared not to have a body or shape. It was as if lights were arrayed on an invisible craft.\" Thanks to Peter Daven- port NUFORC www.ufocenter.com Oval-shaped object in Spain CANTILLANA, SEVILLE PROVINCE — On Dec. 4, 2001, Jose B.S. was driving his vehicle on Highway 116, past kilometer 12 heading toward Mairena del Alcor at 10:58 a.m., when he noticed an oval-shaped object. He says, it was \"similar to a lipstick,\" and white in color. The object followed a westerly trajectory and plummeted in mid-flight before flying horizontally again, stopping, as- cending, and disappearing toward the West at high speed.

French UFOs seen as American secret craft The UFO world has been reverberating for weeks after the September airing on National TV Channel 2 documentary, \"OVNIs, le secret American,\", the work of the French journalist French Vincent Gielly, who dur- ing two years of investigating has interviewed numerous experts, viewed archives, and consulted documents around the globe. The clamor also derives from the fact that the documentary was preview-broadcast exclusively to the French Senate last April 24, arousing a certain interest in the objective and historic piece. The documentary is actually modeled after the life of astronomer/ufologist Dr. J. Allen Hynek. Among the ufologists interviewed (Americans, overall), there are some of the most notable names on the American scene. Already arousing particular interest is news of the inclu- sion of a French counter-espionage official who is ac- tively involved with the subject of UFOs. The program has already garnered positive reviews from numerous newspapers on the other side of the Alps, and followers hope that this signals a turnabout in the way that television handles the subject in their country.

Georgia object identified LA GRANGE — Researcher John Thompson says, 'Today I thought I saw a rare daytime UFO. It went back and forth slowly; left-to-right, right-to-left repeat- edly, for about five minutes. It seemed to stop on a dime and reverse direction. I took several photos of the object as it occasionally flickered brightly with the reflection of sunlight. Guess what? It was a glider catching thermals! I called the La Grange Airport to confirm. \"If I had a video, however, shot from afar, everybody would swear, as another person with me who was watch- ing agreed, that no plane could do that. Gliders can be- cause they have an unbelievable low stall speed.\" Teardrop object in Mississippi VICKSBURG — As the witness sat with kids in his truck waiting for a lady friend about 5:30. p.m., one of the children pointed to the sky and said that she saw a light in the sky, \"which,\" says the witness, \"I'm sure, was the crescent moon. The sun was going down. The sky was very clear and a light color, but the ground was almost as dark as night. When I looked up to see what it was, I saw the moon, and at a distance was a dark object shaped like a plump Hershey's Kiss, or perhaps a teardrop with a slightly flattened-out bottom. \"It was black with a pointed top, and seemed to have an extremely faint aura around it that my friend also no- ticed when she returned. There were no lights on it, and it made no sound. It was east of us in the direction of the Mississippi River. Several others also sighted the UFO.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport NUFORC Diamond-shaped object in Michigan BOYNE CITY — The witness reports, \"At 8 p.m. my husband and I sat down to watch TV, and I heard a loud rumbling sound outside on Nov. 15, 2001. I looked out the window and did not see anything. The next morn- ing our office gal told me she had heard the loud noise at the same time, and saw a flying object over her home heading west that then came back east over her home a second time.'-' A second witness also reports hearing a loud rumbling noise at 8 p.m. the same night and went to her back door to listen. Thinking it was a jet plane she went back inside, but the noise continued getting louder, so she went out again. She only saw stars, and went back inside and asked her husband, son, and son's friend, \"Can't you hear that?\" They thought it was just a slow jet, but went out- side to look. They rushed back in, and said, \"Come out and see this!\" The witness states, \"We could see this huge diamond- shaped UFO with elongated bottom, with a light at each tip and an orange light in the middle.\" It gradually moved off to the northwest, but within five minutes it was com- ing back. We all watched as it traveled over our home traveling southeast. When it got over Boyne City, all of a sudden all of the outside lights started to spin around. Shortly the light on the right side veered off over Lake Charlevoix, which was to the west, while the rest of the craft continued on its course. \"But soon the lone light came back and was heading the same direction as the large craft. It traveled until it was out of sight. I then started calling law enforcement agencies, FAA, and local airports, but was unable to find out anything.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, NUFORC.

Reviewed by Dwight Connelly This is a sequel to Krapf s first book, The Contact Has Begun (1998), which reportedly sold 20,000 copies and caused quite a stir. This second book mainly describes his second alleged visit to a space ship, but also reviews the first book briefly and covers some other material. The author, who shared a Pulitizer Prize as a journalist while with the Los Angeles Times, has received signifi- cant attention because of his mainstream background, which seems to separate him to some extent from other alleged contactees. He retired from the Times in 1993. The tale he tells is fantastic, even for the field of ufology. Leo Sprinkle, Art Bell, and Daniel Sheehan wrote en- dorsements for the book, and Joe Firmage did the Fore- word. In brief, Krapf has supposedly been selected to be the \"star reporter\" for a project involving a race of aliens called the Verdants, who are allegedly working with hun- dreds of prominent humans to prepare Earth for an ET/ human summit and eventual cosmic citizenship. The author says his first contact with the aliens came in 1997 when he awoke at night and found himself en- cased in a luminous shaft of light, then involuntarily beamed aboard an alien spacecraft call the Goodwill. He says that prior to this he had \"virtually no knowledge of the UFO phenomenon.\" Kraph says he was apparently rec- ommended by a staff person at the Los Angeles Times, who he identifies only as X, and who was already in- volved in the project. The Verdants, who claim to come from a planet some 14 million light years away, have supposedly recruited hun- dreds of other individuals-many of them leaders in their fields-to serve as ambassadors, or \"interplanetary diplo- mats,\" to prepare the Earth for public contact. Each ambassador has supposedly been given a spe- cific duty, and each is to draw up a detailed blueprint of how he or she will carry out the assignment. Originally this blueprint was to be completed within three years, but various controversies have slowed the project, so the dead- line is now \"in the near future.\" The Verdants are described as strictly vegetarians who cannot eat meat, though they can turn vegetables into meat-like dishes. They have supposedly mastered the technique of genetic alteration, and can appear in human form. In Verdant form they are just over five feet tall with dark, narrow eyes, nearly imperceptible noses, no visible body hair, and skin tones from grayish white to slightly tan. The males are slightly taller than the females, and the females have a general structure similar to females on Earth, except less pronounced. Verdants normally wear satiny robes of varying muted colors. The typical Verdant lives for 20,000 years, according to the author, and has the ability to become invisible. In terms of religion, as explained by \"Paul,\" Krapf's guardian angel, the Verdants take the position that there is no universal religion, and that each individual's covenant with God is his or her own business. The book reads more like a novel than fact, and per- haps that is appropriate. This is another contactee story with no evidence to back it up. In addition, some of the described incidents seem unlikely. For example, the author's wife was invited to accompany him on his sec- ond visit to the alien craft, but she declined, indicating lack of interest. This is strange, especially since one of the female Verdants-Krapf's favorite-had supposedly of- fered to have sex with the author on the first visit. Yet there is no way to know whether this respected journalist made up the story or not. If abductions are real, can we arbitrarily rule out contactees? If there are contactees, how do we separate the real contactees from the fakes? Krapf's book provides no answer.

This has set me wondering about the problems of the UFO mystery (with which this book is not especially con- cerned). Why is science apparently so reluctant to take this subject seriously? Is the problem theirs, or ours? Ac- tually it is a bit of both. The fear of science Scientists have a very well defined set of rules as to how to deal with new evi- dence. It should be consistent and widespread, as well as sug- gestive of, but relevant to, the need for theory that might ex- plain it. The data should be amenable to reproduction by colleagues in whatever way they choose. And there must be testable hypotheses that they can de- duce from the evidence and which will provide clear cut an- swers, one way or the other, when set against experiments that suggest themselves and will test the theory. Any theory that denies testing is regarded with much distrust by science, which simply does not take things on trust. They have to be demonstrated; that is the essence of scientific thinking. This works extremely well for most purposes. If you discover a new sub atomic particle during a lab experi- ment, then you can carefully explain to fellow physicists what you did and how it appeared, allowing them to rec- reate the experiment and see if it appears for them as well. Sometimes it does, sometimes it does not. But the possible existence of this particle will be toler- ated if it makes sense within the remits of known sci- ence, and its manifestation is logically credible. More at- tempts will be made to find it until it can be independently verified. If it never is, the original research is likely to be strenuously questioned. Should the claim that this new particle exists require a complete reappraisal of existing theory about quantum physics, for example, then it will be less likely to gain interim acceptance. Science will expect to see multiple verifications and a semblance of a working theory as to why this new particle should exist, and good grounds as to why it is not just (for instance) a mistaken reading of some other particle that is already identified. In light of this need, science looks warily at any new Jenny Randies idea that sits uneasily with our current state of knowl- edge, and for which multiple verification is not possible, let alone any ideas that are testable by way of experi- ment. It often cries the request to see good evidence and we might say-but we have thai-case after case in which witness A says this happened, or that did. But science means more than we can offer. By good evidence it does not mean anecdotes. It means hard evi- dence. If the existence of a new sub atomic particle re- lied only on some physicist saying that he saw one form in front of his eyes in a lab one Tuesday afternoon, but it has never appeared again, and he cannot explain to colleagues why it turned up that one time, science will say, politely, come back when it does! The expectation of UFOlogy UFOlogists live with their evidence day in, day out. We meet witnesses who have often clearly seen some- thing extraordinary, insofar as they are concerned! And we can view it in the context of an accumulation of evi- dence and recognise the patterns. Witness A sees a red mass and says that her car en- gine stalled when it was overhead. Her headlights went out. Her skin startled to tingle and her eyes began to wa- ter. We immediately recognise the pattern and say that this is a car stop or vehicle interference case, for which we can cite a dozen similar references. To us. this is enough to be sure that at least some of these witnesses are telling the truth and thus describing a phenomenon that behaves in an apparently interesting way. We devise our theories-perhaps that it is some rare type of atmospheric electrified cloud or that these are side ef^ fects of an alien craft perusing the highway. And we move on to look for further cases. UFOlogists, if you like, are data collectors and the cre- ators of the big idea immune to the need of the grinding process of verification. Scientists, on the other hand, pre- fer to be experimenters and the creators of the steady progression of theories based on already existing ideas. To them proof is everything. In many ways these two .are not that compatible. What does science want? So what would science like to see from UFOlogists in order to pay attention to what we regard as important data and that we feel sure really ought to excite them? The first thing they would ask about a case such as the one above would be for physical parameters that few UFOlogists ever seek. We are curious about what the witness was doing, how they felt at the time, and the color and speed of the UFO. Scientists will be asking if this thing was not some misperception (for instance of an aircraft flying through a thunderstorm), then how could the alleged physical ef- fects that were experienced by the witness or the conse- quences to her car have occurred? They will be curious about the level of electrostatic charge in the witness' body and the comparison with her normal levels of body electricity. Was it greater after the sighting? If so, for how long did this effect last? As for (Continued on Page 22) Page 20 MUFON UFO Journal January 2002"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Perceptions IV; .-X ; ,^i i :. ; :4i%. LJ' By Stanton T. Friedman Stanton T. Friedman Do government documents disprove Roswell? It has been fashionable for a number of years for Roswell denyers to claim that various and sundry govern- ment documents PROVE that no alien spacecraft was recovered near Roswell, NM, in early July, 1947, as claimed in books such as Crash at Corona-The Defini- tive Story of the Roswell Inci- dent by Don Berliner and myself. Unfortunately, the claims be- tray a lack of understanding of how security works. First of all, it isn't enough to have an appro- priate security clearance to gain access to classified documents. One must also have an appropri- ate Need-to-Know for the docu- ments in question. For example, when I worked on radiation shielding for aircraft nuclear propulsion systems atGE, I read and wrote technical reports classified as Secret Restricted Data. In a classified version of Nuclear Science Abstracts I often found listings for re- ports about radiation shielding produced for Admiral Rickover's nuclear submarine program, also classified SRD. However, I could not obtain them because Rickover wouldn't grant a need-to-know for persons outside his program. A basic rule Secondly it is a basic rule that one cannot present data of higher classification in a lower classification report. Philip Klass once tried to say there was no crash because a CIA UFO document released by the CIA in response to a lawsuit and subsequent Judge's demand for a file search didn't discuss any such crash. But the CIA docu- ment was only listed as Confidential. Above Confidential there is SECRET, and then TOP SECRET, and then TOP SECRET-Code word. The lat- ter might include UMBRA, ULTRA, MAJIC. Having a TS clearance without access to code word material meant one didn't get it. In addition, while the existence of most classified Re- search & Development (R & D) programs is known and only the data is classified, there are also numerous \"Black\" programs whose very existence is classified. For example, the Naval Research Lab first admitted publicly in 1995 that it had launched the first electronic Intelligence Satel- lite-in 1960. The first public release of information about Bletchley Park in England where 12,000 people labored long and hard decoding and translating intercepted Ger- man military communications wasn't made until 25 years after WW II. It was a black program, as was the devel- opment of the U-2, the Stealth Fighter, the SR-71 etc. The Director of Central Intelligence admitted in 1996 that his annual black budget was $26.6 billion. Is there any reason to conclude that there is TS Code Word material on UFOs as part of a black program? In a Jan. 31,1949, FBI document is the following statement: \"This matter [flying saucers] is considered top secret by Intelligence Officers of both the Army and the Air Force.\" In a Nov. 21,1950, formerly TS document from Wilbert B. Smith, head of the Canadian government's UFO study programs, one finds this comment: \"The matter [Flying Saucers] is the most highly classified subject in the United States Government.\" This surely implies TS Code word material is here. So where is it? None in declassified Blue Book There is no formerly TS material in the declassified portion of the Project Blue Book Files. There is an inter- esting formerly TS UFO sighting report involving US Sena- tor Richard Russell. There is AIR-A joint Air Force and Office of Navel Intelligence Report, not giving a full his- tory of highly classified UFO activities, but intended to focus only on the implications of whether UFOs repre- sented Soviet craft. It is not uncommon for task forces to be set up to inde- pendently look at different aspects of the same problem. For example, Operation Solarium involved lots of high level military and civilian personnel divided into three separate groups in 1953. Each was tasked to look at a different approach to containment of the Soviet Union. These ef- forts, under the overall Direction of Dr. (General) James H. Doolittle, set US foreign policy for many years. The reports were not released (lightly censored) until after 1980, and aren't noted in any earlier histories of the time. Can the US government lie to protect its secrets? Of course; it has to. For example, the government had to say something when a number of people observed the first nuclear explosion in New Mexico on July 16,1945, from a distance of more than 100 miles. A press release stated that an ammunition dump had blown up, and fortunately nobody was injured. A favorite of the the Roswell Denyers is the SECRET September 23,1947, memo from MJ-12 member Gen. Nathan F. Twining, then head of the Air Materiel Com- mand at Wright Field in Ohio. It notes \"h.(2) The lack of Physical evidence in the shape of crash recovered exhibits which would undeniably prove the existence of these objects.\" Doesn't this prove there was no crashed saucer? Of course not. Top Secret-code word required Everything about a crashed saucer would have been TOP SECRET Code Word and could NOT have been mentioned in a lowly SECRET Memo. This memo does give a hint in that Twining listed the following groups among those that should be on the list for future flying saucer info distribution: Atomic Energy Commission, JRDB (Joint Research and Development Board), NACA (National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics, RAND (Technol- January 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"ogy Think Tank) and NEPA (Nuclear Energy for the Pro- pulsion of Aircraft). All of these were connected with technology. All had links to Dr. Vannevar Bush, also named in the Eisenhower Briefing Document, and logically so, as a member of Operation Majestic 12. j^ McCoy report Another favorite of the doubting Thomases is a state- ment iivthe SECRET report on a briefing by Wright Field's Col. IvIcCoy to the large USAF Scientific Advisory Board which Comments about the absence of physical evidence. Does.this prove there was no crash? Of course not. Even if McCoy knew there had been one, he couldn't say so in a SECRET BRIEFING. Another example comes from a study I did while at Aerojet General Nucleonics for the Foreign Technology DIV of the USAF at Wright Patterson AF Base. I issued two reports. One was an unclassified bibliography of So- viet technology that might be useful in building compact reactors for space applications. It made no mention at all of the highly classified report in which I evaluated the work, and, as it happens, successfully predicted the Sovi- ets would be launching reactors for space applications. Karl Pflock (Roswell: Inconvenient Facts and the Will to Believe) mentions the two TS reports noted above and lists a bunch of others which he claims show there was no Roswell crash, even though they were almost all only SECRET. Not even TOP SECRET and certainly not TOP SECRET Code word. Absence of EVIDENCE is NOT evidence for Ab- sence. The real Roswell Denyer was USAF Col. Rich- ard Weaver, compiler of the huge USAF's \"The Roswell Report: Truth vs. Fiction in the New Mexico Desert.\" He supplied the fiction. He quoted this item from a July 8, 1947, FBI Memo. \"The object found resembles a high altitude weather balloon with a radar reflector {but that telephonic conversation between their office and Wright field had not borne out this belief}.\" Even though the re- port has about 1,000 pages, the brief memo is not included. Why? Because he left out the comment in brackets. This only reverses the meaning of the quote! None available in the archives Having spent considerable time at a total of 19 docu- ment archives, I can say that none provided formerly TS Code word documents on any subject. The Dee Library mentioned it had a drawerful. The JFK Library had 10 drawers full. In a real deception, the National Security Agency claims it finally released in 1996 the 156 TS Code Word \"UFO documents\" withheld even from Federal Court Judge Gesell in 1980, because of Sources and Methods info. They^lied. All but 1 or 2 lines on each page were cen- sored^using white-out instead of the black ink used to obscure the TS Code Word Affidavit given to the judge justifying the withholding-and which played so well for me on TV.

(Continued from Page 20) the car, what strength of EM field would be required to create the power defects reported, and would this lead to a permanent effect on the vehicle that can be measured across time? What are the known results of a human being suffering exposure to a similar level of radiation-so these can be compared with the effects that witness A reveals. In other words, the UFOlogist provides a case report that interests other UFOlogists, but on the whple.it does not give scientists what they seek. How do we bridge the gap? So how do we bridge this gulf between data that we normally provide and the sort of evidence that science seeks? A scientist is likely to want to study the .car and the witness, but that may well be impossible. Why? Be- cause the case may have occurred months or years be- fore it was reported, so an investigation today is doomed to failure insofar as securing any scientific data.! But there are ways in which science and UFOlogy could get together and figure out a protocol that alleviates such difficulties. For instance, scientists could define to us sets of criteria from which we can identify a case; that will interest them. They can advise us of the questions that will need to be asked up front about various types of cases.    . .;.,.- And together we can create an early warning system whereby we improve our capacity to discover and react to physical evidence cases within minutes or hours, not weeks or months, as well as a process by which inter- ested scientists can then follow these up immediately. After all, if they decry the lack of calibre of the evidence that we provide, then it behooves them to respond to it when we come up with the goods that fits their needs. Perhaps UFOlogy could create a joint conference with interested scientists from outside the UFO field with an aim to working through such a protocol and finding those scientists out there ready and willing to act if something happens that can be studied by the methods that they are used to. These people do exist. Maybe we should go out there, find them, and take the initiative to forge this new way forward?

The Mars Odys- sey spacecraft orbiting Mars begins mapping the planet's surface to determine its mineral composition and hydro- gen abundance-the latter as a clue to subsurface water-ice distribution. Venus (-3.9) emerges in the western evening sky at dusk late in the month. The bright planet, however, is very low and sets less than one hour after sunset. Jupiter (-2.5), in Gemini, can be seen high up in the SE at dusk. Thereafter, the big planet moves westward across the southern sky during the night. It lies very close to the gibbous Moon on Feb. 22. Saturn (0.0), near Aldebaran in Taurus, stands high in the SSE at twilight, advancing westward during the night. On the 20th the first quarter Moon occults (covers) Sat- urn for more than an hour after sunset for observers in the East and Midwest. Local entry-exit times for a few selected cities: Miami, 7:04-8:28 PM; Washington, 7:18-8:40: Chicago, 6:05-7:15. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Jupiter sets in the NW about 4 AM in mid-February. Saturn sets in the WNW about 1:45 AM in midmonth. Hubble Service Mission: For nearly 12 years the Hubble Space Telescope has made one astronomical discovery after another, revolu- tionizing our knowledge of the universe. In mid-February the HST is scheduled to receive its 4th overhaul. Shuttle astronauts will install an advanced camera system, a new power control unit, a new cooling system for the inactive infrared camera-spectrometer called NICMOS, and fi- nally improved solar panels. Moon Phases: Last quarter—Feb. 4 New moon~Feb. 12 First quarter-Feb. 20 Full moon—Feb. 27 (Nearest Moon of the year. Large tides.) The Stars: The brilliant star Sirius appears due S at 9 PM and thus is at its highest altitude above the horizon. It is one of the bright luminaries comprising the Winter Circle. Moving clockwise from Sirius (in Canis Major the Big Dog), one can easily pick out the other members of the Circle-Pro- cyon in the constellation Canis Minor the Little Dog, Pol- lux and Castor in Gemini the Twins, Capella in Auriga the Charioteer, Aldebaran in Taurus the Bull, and Rigel in Orion the Hunter. The two brightest nocturnal stars lie one above the other, separated by 37 degrees. The lower star Canopus (magnitude-0.6), 2nd brightest star after Sirius (-1.4), can be seen in the U.S. only from southern latitudes below 38 degrees N at this season. Leo the Lion's appearance above the E horizon por- tends the coming of spring next month. Look for the Lion's sickle-shaped head and mane. Between the Sickle of Leo and the Twin Stars of Gemini (Pollux and Castor), look for a very dim patch of light. (A clear dark sky is required.) The patch is resolved with a telescope or binoculars into a wedge-shaped cluster of stars in Cancer the Crab called the Beehive.

In a note to Richard Haines. I wrote: \"What year was it?\" But Karolyn did not know, which is not surprising for a little girl. A second note raised the question: \"How old is she here?\" To this question she immediately answered: \"Twelve years old.\" She also believed that she was in the sixth grade. Now if Karolyn was twelve years old, and she was born on April 3,1934, then the year of the discussion with Uncle Ralph Scheibly must have been 1946. Since her uncle reported on the events of the previous year, the event would have taken place in 1945. VE Day was May 8, 1945, and VJ Day was September 2. 1945. So the crash could have taken place just prior to the conclusion of World War II, or, conceivably, just following VJ Day. Karolyn was making some attempt to locate other in- dividuals who had been at the crash site. But this was not to be. She died on the operating table at St. Mary's hospi- tal in San Francisco on Nov. 19, 1992. January 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 23"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"By John F. Schuessler MUFON International Director Happy New Year 2002 The months following the 9-11 tragedy have been tough on all businesses and organizations. As with many non- profit organizations, MUFON saw a drop in financial sup- port during the last three months of 2001. However, the government experts are predicting a recovery from the recession in the spring of 2002 and this bodes well for the country and for MUFON. With your support we will do some new and interest- ing things in our quest for answers to the UFO mystery. It won't be easy, but if we are aggressive we can make some significant progress. Some of the things we have planned are as follows: * Obtain a donation of com- puter server equipment so we can locate the hardware for the MUFON Worldwide UFO Database at the MUFON Headquarters. This will include expanding its storage capabil- ity. We owe this to Don Weatherby and Wendy Ban for their hard work in getting our system up and running and to Bill Konkolesky for his work on our website. 4Start using PayPal on our website for enrolling for MUFON membership and for sales of MUFON mer- chandise (books, shirts, caps, videos, pins, etc.). * Increasing the number of MUFON members in at- tendance at the 33 rd MUFON International UFO Sym- posium in Rochester, NY, in July. This will be a signifi- cant event and our members will really benefit from their participation. 4 Continue publication of the MUFON UFO Journal while increasing the amount of data content obtained from thorough, hard-hitting investigations. Regional Directors and State Directors are urged to provide narrative re- ports of investigations, suitable for publication in the Jour- nal, along with their inputs to Oscar LaFuente, the MUFON Director of Investigations. * Begin an aggressive quest for grants that will allow us to begin a number of research projects that are long overdue. George Zeiler will be working at the MUFON Headquarters to coordinate the applications for grants. Colorado MUFON members Ken Storch, Lin Simpson, and Ethan Rich are key players on our grant application team. * Increase cooperation with other UFO organizations and non-MUFON researchers. A united front is badly needed. John Schuessler Call for Symposium Proceedings Art Work Thanks to the outstanding talent of MUFON graphic- artists, the cover of each year's MUFON International UFO Symposium Proceedings book has been unique and exciting. Again this year we are calling for proposed cover designs from our artists. The theme of the symposium is \"Unity in Ufology/Connecting with the Scientific Com- munity\". We welcome submittal of your proposed de- signs, to be received at MUFON Headquarters. P.O. Box 369, Morrison. CO 80465-0369 by March 1, 2002.
