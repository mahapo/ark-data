FROM THE EDITOR The UFO phenomenon, at least as reported, has undergone several dramatic permutations over the last forty years. So it should come as no surprise to see change overtake the Journal as well. In this issue we introduce, if only in limited fashion, desktop publishing to the Journal. Eventually, we hope to produce the entire publication in this manner. But the final switch-over will require a good deal of time and energy on our part, and an equal portion of patience on yours. We ask that you bear with us in the meantime. In fact, recently breaking events in the field have been such that several items scheduled for inclusion in this issue were unavoidably pushed back to a later time. We apologize to those authors we have had to momentarily displace, and hope we will be back on normal footing next month. Even with an expanded 32 pages, we have been forced to cut back much material originally intended to appear at this time. Again, such decisions are entirely those of the editor, who assumes full responsibility for same. In this issue ROSWELL & THE X-15: UFO BASICS Leonard H.

His last appear- ance here was in the January 1989 issue. As we nudge toward the last decade of the 20th century, basic UFO re- search is still no nearer to exposing the truth about the UFO, with verifiable facts, than when it ushered in the 1980's. If anything, as activists, we are wallowing deeper and deeper in our own self-muddied waters. Despite the good work of many qual- ified researchers in the past decade, the impact of their disclosures, or mes- sages of wisdom, seldom rise above the noise of busy rumormills feeding us the pap of mis/disinformation. Wary of the noise, the media still opt to repudiate UFO stories as factless anecdotes, while responsible world governments, whose secret agencies are supposedly in possession of the truth, remain aloof, admitting nothing. No admission, no story. Thus isolated from the main- stream of world affairs, UFOs are left adrift in the heavens, and we, their re- searchers, talking only among our- selves. Have we been outsmarted by the elusive \"them,\" or, as usual, have we only outsmarted ourselves? Whichever the case, it's high time for a change in posture. To momentarily please the devil's advocate on this premise, perhaps we should turn away from trying to ration- alize ufological intrigue and go back to some old saucer basics. In my opinion, the basics are UFO events that tend to support no special interest group, or to espouse any one hypothesis. Simply, they relate to an un- By Leonard Stringfield usual report of an incident caused by an unidentified aerial object or a mil- itary action or reaction to that in- cident. Resorting to the basics may prove nothing, but I believe it lends credence to the postulation that the real UFO is an intelligently controlled craft whose incursive actions have giv- en good cause for an official coverup. Many such instances of UFO activity, apart from crash/retrievals, have come to my attention in the past ten years, but I gave them only a cursory review. Like many other researchers, I was lured away or diverted by more sensa- tional events, like the abduction mania and, of course, MJ-12. Revitalized After my \"Status Report V, UFO Crash/Retrievals: Is the Coverup Lid Lifting?\" was published in the January 1989 issue of the MUFON UFO Jour- nal, revitalizing interest in my research, I became privileged to learn of a new, firsthand source who appeared to have important information relating to the Roswell incident. Just Cause had ear- lier received a letter from this source, and after discussing its potential value with the editor, Barry Greenwood agreed to send me a copy and gave me the green light to follow up. On January 26, 1989, I was able to make contact with the source in a remote western state. To gain his trust, I promptly explained the confidential arrangement with Greenwood and provided my own credentials. In short time, \"Tim\" agreed to cooperate. Tim proved to have been a proud member of the only atomic bomb wing extant at the time, the 509th Bomb Group, stationed at Roswell Army Air Force Base in 1947. And as one of his fellow crew members reminded him on July 9th of that year, they were \"making history\" on their flight aboard a B-29, which they believed transported the deceased alien cadavers from the Ro- swell airbase in New Mexico to Car- swell in Fort Worth, Texas. In consid- eration of the sensitivity of Tim's posi- tion, I agreed to the terms he requested concerning the release of his informa- tion, which includes concealing certain details mostly pertaining to his profes- sional career, including rank, assigned duty aboard the flight, and the identity of key personnel involved in his special mission. As one of the few dramatispersonae of the Roswell story, Tim's eyewitness information was of course of extreme interest to me personally and to those who support my endeavors. In the long run, however, it may prove to be of even more importance as a vital piece of evidence in any future congressional hearing or in the chronicles of a histo- rian. For the sake of accuracy, then, Tim and I reviewed to the verge of bore- dom, piece by piece, every aspect of his role, his observations and speculations to the best of his memory, even grading key issues such as his recall of atten- dant personnel and duties aboard the flight into three categories: Positive, Probable and Uncertain. Tim's Account We begin witth Tim's original story, excerpted from his letter to Just Cause, as follows: \"On this day our crew had not been on the flying roster. We had accom- plished our period of ground school in the morning, then went to the skeet range after lunch. The Aircraft Com- mander had broken 48 targets, and I was next with 47 out of 50. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 259 November 1989"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"\"The sergeant in charge of the range asked us if we had heard about the \"Flying Disk\" that had crashed out in the desert. Twice more before leaving the skeet range we heard reports of a space ship with bodies inside that had been found on a ranch in the area. When the truck dropped us off at the squadron area most of the other crews had been released for the day. The operations officer told our captain to keep the crew together because he thought he had a flight for us. We ex- pected this was a last minute test hop on a plane needed for the next day's mission. I loved test hops, for on many of them the pilot would let me be the co-pilot and sometimes I would get to- make a landing. No Routine Flight \"We were sent out to preflight our own airplane; we knew then it was no test flight. The preflight of a B-29 was a lengthy operation, requiring a visual pressure check of each engine's fuel system, plus many other details. An hour later we were told to taxi the plane to the \"Pit,\" a place where the atomic bomb was normally loaded. \"We were positioned so the front bomb-bay was directly over the pit, which was covered with a large tarp. But no atomic bomb was in the pit that afternoon. \"When the canvas was removed by the loading crew, all we could see was a very large wooden box. We stood off to the side and were not allowed more than a glimpse of the loading process. The box was sitting on a platform of the type we often used to carry cargo on. Once the load was secured in the bomb-bay four military policemen went inside and took positions at each cor- ner of the box. I think two of them were majors, and one a lieutenant. The fourth man was an NCO. \"Three other officers of company and field grade were positioned in the forward and aft crew compartments. The officer crew members went to base operations for flight clearance and briefing. When they returned only the bombardier was allowed to go in the bomb-bay and check the security of the load. The engineer and I had no problem at all, and no ballast was re- quired in the tail, so I guess now that it was less than 5000 pounds. \"Once airborne we were told the des- tination was the AAFB at Ft. Worth, Texas. By now we were aware that this was no routine cargo mission. The rank and number of the M. P.'s were clues that we had something important on board. One of our officers speculated that it was the household goods of some high-ranking ground-pounder being transferred to Ft. Worth. This was a reasonable guess. \"I do not remember connecting it with the \"Flying Disk Crash\" story until we were on the way back. We left most of the security people in Ft. Worth. I think only one, maybe two, came back with us. I do remember the strong lecture of this being a routine flight that we must not talk about. One of the crew, a very outspoken individual, said on the way home that we were now a part of history. He went on to say it was the disk and remains of the flight crew, because he had seen a man he recognized in the reception group. This man was a mortician by military speci- alty. \"For weeks rumors were plentiful, and we were hard pressed to maintain the silence we had been ordered to keep.\" If Tim's flight indeed transported the bodies, and not additional debris from the wreckage, then his testimony fits well into the scenario that says his was the third mission from Roswell. To prove it, of course, we would need ac- cess to official records, if they still ex- ist, which is doubtful, for obvious reas- ons. Despite the paucity of firsthand testimony from surviving personnel, I feel reasonably sure of \"Pappy\" Hen- derson's flight of July 8, 1947, which transported the main \"wreckage\" in a B-29 (or possibly a C-54) to Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio. According to the testimony of Major Jesse Marcel, he had been bumped from this flight. Jesse Marcel Also according to Marcel, he flew to Carswell in a B-29 on July 8th. Notably, he referred to the cargo not as a crate, but as a \"half B-29-ful\" of fragments he had collected from the crash site on the Brazel ranch. Once at the airbase, his job was done. General Roger Ra- mey, in charge of the operations, re- leased the story to the media that the downed saucer was actually a weather balloon, and ordered Marcel to return to Roswell, which he did the following day, July 9th. Of significance, Tim remembers Marcel's involvement. To refresh his memory, he was sent a copy of the 509th Bomb Group's 1947 yearbook. He said he recalls his (Marcel's) pre- sence on the scene, but is not sure where. \"It's possible,\" said Tim, \"that he was one of the officers to greet my plane at Carswell, but my guess is that he was on my return flight to Roswell.\" Based on known information, Marcel was unaware of the retrieved bodies and would not have a need-to-know qualification to greet the plane. A sealed crate, however, would surely have aroused suspicion. Crucial, then, in coordinating the se- quence of events, is the date of Tim's flight. Understandably blurred by the passage of time, and without any offi- cial 509th records to substantiate such a secret mission, he was at first uncer- tain of the date. \"One clue, for sure,\" he said. \"The weather that day was sunny and hot during a season known for its thunderstorms.\" MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 259 November 1989"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"In a letter received in February, Tim entertained the notion that his flight might have been July 8 or 9, based on an illegible entry in a pocket diary that he had salvaged from his Roswell days. As it became increasingly important to fix a date, considering the impact of his revelations and the surfacing of new material (unknown to Tim), I called October 2, asking him to take another look at his diary. A tall request, in- deed, in light that I knew he was in the midst of moving to a new residence, and I was told that it was already stored somewhere in a box. Then on October 5, Tim called. \"I found the diary,\" he announced. \"It was the ninth. I found the dates of my flights, clearly circled on the calendar, inside the back cover, which backs up my log entries for July 4th, 9th, 26th, 28th and 29th.\" Log Entries Following are Tim's flight entries in his log for July, 1947: July 4,1947 DEH (CAA station des- ignation for Roswell), Ship 6291.

For one thing, it backs up the scenario that Marcel returned to Roswell on Tim's flight. Other dramatic events on the 8th and 9th of July were linked to Marcel's flight to Carswell. New evi- dence reveals that during this period, a special detachment of troops from Ro- swell found three alien bodies (maybe four) about two-and-a-half miles from the crash site on the Brazel ranch. While this expeditionary discovery was probably unknown to Marcel, a figure so important to our recon- structed scenario, the magnitude of its shock surely would have triggered a state of alarm at the highest levels of government in Washington. And we can assume that hasty and momentous decisions were made, at least one of which, the urge toward secrecy, haunts us still. In the short run, however, the exotic cadavers had to be protected, pre- served, photographed and crated for shipment out of Roswell. By the after- noon of July 9, the bodies were ready for their shipment to Carswell. In my mind, Tim made that historic flight. \"Everything about the fight was un- usual,\" said Tim. \"So tight was security, we knew that the crate contained more than the general's furniture.\" It was made of wood, he said, and was un- painted and unmarked as though has- tily constructed. Fitting snugly into the bomb-bay, it was approximately 5 feet high, four wide and fifteen long. Ac- cording to my calculations, these di- mensions would suitably accommodate three 4-foot tall bodies (or parts of bodies) placed in a lengthwise row. But beyond the mystery of the crate and the extraordinary security mea- sures at Roswell and Carswell, the strongest factor in support of Tim's be- lief that his plane carried the bodies is found in the words of a fellow crew member, the officer who recognized a former school chum, a mortician, among the contingent of greeters at Carswell. The names of the pilot, co-pilot and those of his crew members that he can recall are known to me, but Tim pre- fers, understandably at this time, that they not be published. Perhaps in the near future more can be revealed about them and their roles. Tim's disclosures, based on the raw facts as he observed them, basically il- lustrate a military reaction to a UFO event. His information may seem cir- cumstantial to the skeptic, but thought of in the context of the whole, as it links to the testimony of many other re- liable witnesses, the case could stand up in any court of law. Behind scenes, several months after my initial contact with Tim, another door opened for me. Don Schmitt, Di- rector of Special Investigations for CUFOS, also had been quietly digging into the Roswell affair, with telling re- sults. Of special interest, I learned, new information had surfaced which not only tied in with Tim's experience, but also with that of a former GI, who, living in England with his British wife and family, had been a part of the 509th retrieval team at the crash site. Of note, he told one of his daughters that he had seen three recovered bod- ies. (See Case 11, in my Status Report V: Walt Andrus also met with the Eng- lish widow and her two daughters in London on July 15,1989.) Indicating an interest in my Roswell material, Schmitt and author Kevin Randle visited my home to compare notes. Quickly realizing the impact of our respective material, we agreed to pool our findings for the good of re- search. With new information still sur- facing as I write this, some of it aug- menting or amending the spadework done by Bill Moore and Stanton Friedman, my colleague hopes to soon MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 259 November 1989"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"publish a definitive paper to set the re- cord straight about the crash/retrieval incident. It could change the posture of UFO research, the media and world thinking on the subject. Since I introduced Mrs. Sappho Henderson, wife of the late Captain \"Pappy\" Henderson, and revealed her story of his Roswell exploit to research (Status Report V), she has appeared on TV's \"Unsolved Mysteries\" pro- gram on September 20th. She did well and I am pleased. However, at her request, I did not disclose her address and phone num- ber to other researchers, including Stan Friedman. Chagrined over my lack of cooperation, he managed to lo- cate her and persuade her to appear on the show. This is good and I ap- plaud his indefatigable efforts. For me, it proves that so many of my nameless or address-less sources do exist, and that their anecdotal stories are not al- ways fairy tales. No apologies, then, for my rigid position that honors the re- quests and trust of my sources. These people make the rules, and I must abide by them. I will continue this practice. A more recent chat with Mrs. Hen- derson provided a new morsel for thought. She said that when her hus- band read the story about Roswell in the tabloid Globe, February 17, 1981 issue, and first broke the news of his own involvement, his comments about the accompanying drawings, showing the alien head and hand, were that they were \"accurate.\" This gave her reason to believe that he might actually have seen the bodies, but she was quick to add that he never said so. By coincidence, the drawings he looked at were those I roughly sketched for my first paper on UFO crash/retrievals, \"Retrievals of the Third Kind,\" presented at the 9th an- nual MUFON UFO Symposium in Day- ton, Ohio, in 1978.

Stan Friedman informed me that he was the interviewer, not Moore. Although the book, The RosweJl In- cident, is vague about who made phone or personal interviews (see p. 62), I believe that Friedman should be credited for his legwork. X-15 UFO Sightings The second arena I selected for this article relating to UFO basics involves NASA. In 1962, during test flights of the X-15 out of Edwards AFB, there were two known occasions when their flights encountered UFOs. On one, a camera recorded two disks near the X- 15 at an altitude of 200,000 feet. The encounters, 1 believe, are signifi- cant in that they suggest a UFO in- terest, not only in our early experimen- tal aircraft in general, but in our high- altitude test flights with an outer space connection in particular. The encounters are also significant because they come from a firsthand, qualified source who had been in- volved with the X-15 program as a co- ordinator for the fiights, and who also saw the movie in question.

Vel. i S.4SM (3,832 mph) While these encounters made only spotty news at the time and were en- tered with incorrect details in NICAP records, my source, who visited my home on several occasions, has pro- vided ample backup papers, such as the flight chart of the incident with cam- era, various memoranda over his signa- ture, and a list of the NASA pilots and other personnel at the base, many of them future astronauts, including Neil Armstrong. The source of this information is a graduate engineer and pilot with ap- proximately 1,000 flying hours in com- mand. He is presently cleared Secret, Special Access on the B-2 program. At the time of the sightings, he was a test engineer on the X-15 program at Ed- wards AFB, and in this position had virtually unlimited access to the X-15 aircraft, the flight line, hangars, flight test data, and the X-15 Flight Test Control Room. He was in daily contact with the pilots and ground crews. Following, then, is my source's account of the two X-15 UFO en- counters with drawings showing their relative positions. UFOs Filmed During a design altitude flight on April 30,1962, two disk-shaped objects overtook the X-15 at an altitude of ap- proximately 200,000 feet, while at a speed of approximately 3,400 m.p.h., or 5000 fps. The X-15 had been launched from the vicinity of Mud Lake, Neva- da, with Joseph A. Walker, NASA, at the controls. At the time of the sighting he was climbing at a pitch angle of ap- proximately 30 degrees. Walker sighted the two aircraft pass- ing overhead and reported to the NA- SA FRC Control Room at Edwards, \"Two UFOs just passed overhead.\" (The writer and approximately 20 oth- ers were in the Control Room and per- sonally heard Walker's report. No oth- er details were supplied by Walker.) The aft fuselage cameras on the X-15 captured the UFOs on film which was later viewed by the writer, the ground crew, and key X-15 Program personnel at the post-flight debriefing. (The in- cident was not discussed in any detail during the debriefing, however.) The film was good quality, and clearly showed two white or silver disk- shaped craft flying in tight formation, rapidly overtaking the X-15 from be- hind and passing overhead, perhaps only 100-200 feet above the X-15. Dis- position of the film is unknown. During a world altitude record flight on July 17, 1962, Major Robert M. White, USAF, reported to NASA FRC Control that \"several\" UFOs were flying in formation with him and were \"like the color of paper.\" Again, the writer and 20 other Control Room personnel overheard the conversation, although no other details were given at that time. White was in level (zero-G) flight at his peak altitude of 314,000 feet; his speed was approximately 3,800 m.p.h. During debriefing White elab- orated that there were 5 or 6 UFOs, and perhaps as many as 8 or 10. Copyright 1989 by Leonard H. String- ffeld. AJ1 rights reserved.

Moore UFO researcher William Moore and his investigative activities have recently been the subject of con- siderable controversy, both within and without the ufological com- munity. Some of those doubts culminated in the publication of a recent article in the Journal by Robert Hastings, which hinted at government contact and involve- ment. Prior to publication, Moore was apprised of the article's con- tents and given the opportunity to respond in writing. Moore's response eventually ap- peared in the form of a lengthy speech delivered at the MUFON symposium in Las Vegas this past summer, and also as an almost complete issue of his quarterly Focus newsletter (4219 W. Olive, Suite 247, Burbank, CA, 91505). Unfortunately, this paper arrived too late to be included in the official proceedings as published. We now provide it for our readers in the in- terest of completeness, and also as Moore's open reply to his critics. The response seems to have been much misunderstood at the time of delivery, as well as in the immediate aftermath. Hopefully, publication here will at least bring the public record up to date. The second part of his virtually verbatim talk will ap- pear in the next issue of the Journal. Ladies and gentleman, friends and enemies, associates and colleagues — in short, fellow UFOlogists: I had real- ly wanted to come here tonight and \"kick ass,\" but fortunately for us all wiser heads have prevailed and we are going to keep this presentation as professional as possible. Before I begin, it seems appropriate to first take a few moments to per- sonally thank Mr. Walt Andrus of the MUFON organization, and the organizers and hosts of this sym- 8 posium, whose kind invitation made it possible for me to be here tonight. I am also appreciative of this excellent time spot, which must mean that those who arranged the schedule think I have something interesting to say. I shall try not to disappoint you. I might also add that my talk is primarily directed to those of you who are members of the UFO communi- ty. That is not to suggest that those of you who are here as third parties won't find it interesting; it is just that you might not be able to follow some of the \"in-house\" comments that I am going to make. (As opposed to \"outhouse\" comments, which I shall try to avoid even though in some cases they might be appropriate.) At this point, allow me to introduce myself. I am aware that you already know my name, and I am equally cer- tain that many of you are wondering, \"Just who is Bill Moore, and what is he up to?\" Added to that, I'm sure, are many other questions: \"Is this man a government agent?\"; \"What about his rumored contact within the intelligence community?\"; \"Are the MJ-12 documents real or counterfeit, and if counterfeit, did he .forge them?\"; and \"Isn't he just really in it for the money?\" The truth about Bill Moore, I'm afraid, is considerably less sensational. Those of you out there who know me can vouch for it. Those who don't can verify it easily enough. Career Bill Moore graduated from college in 1965. Between that time and 1979, I spent fourteen years as a high school teacher and a concurrent ten years as a part-time labor relations expert and collective bargaining consultant within the structure of the Minnesota Educa- tion Association. In both cases, I had an excellent reputation. In 1979, after having successfully published The Philadelphia Experiment with co- author Charles Berlitz, I resigned my teaching position and moved with my family to Arizona in order to take up writing full-time. In 1980, I co- authored a second bestseller, The Roswell Incident, which was the preliminary account of an investiga- tion into an alleged UFO crash in New Mexico in 1947. At the time, the book was skeptical- ly received by the UFO community and mercilessly panned by the debunkers. I stood my ground, broke with Berlitz, weathered the storm of rocks and mud that was thrown in my direction, and ultimately, with con- tinued high quality research and a careful, skeptical, journalistic ap- proach, managed to persuade many of the initial doubters that there was indeed something to the case. In so doing, I earned the respect of many of you in the audience, and I expect that my reputation and credibility with respect to the Roswell case is at least partly responsible for my having been invited to speak here tonight. I urge you to keep that in mind. If you are one of those who respected my work on Roswell, then I ask you to consider that I am trying to carry on the same sort of quality investigation with respect to the project I am currently working on. It's just that the cir- cumstances are quite different, and I have not been in a position, until now, to properly inform others about what I have been doing. This, unfortunate- ly, has given rise to considerable con- troversy, with a number of falsehoods having been spread by others in the UFO community who saw fit to jump to hasty conclusions inappropriately formed without benefit of all the facts. One of the most persistent rumors about me is that I am a rich man, or that I am somehow funded by the government to spread disinformation and dissention within the UFO com- munity. Neither could be further from the truth. The real Bill Moore is as MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 259 November 1989"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"poor as a church mouse. I came away from a divorce in 1983 with virtually nothing but a few clothes and an old car. I went through bankruptcy shortly thereafter, and began to rebuild my life. The money I make from writing, royalties, and the sale of mostly UFO- oriented books and publications is all plowed back into living expenses and continuing research. It is a constant scrape to get by, but I believe in what I am doing and in order to preserve the freedom necessary to keep my project going I have had to make sacrifices. I am definitely not in this business for the money. I live in a rented house, drive a 1977 car and a 1979 motorcycle. I have no savings ac- counts, no stocks, no bonds, and I recently had to let my health in- surance lapse after the company doubled my premiums and I couldn't afford to pay it any longer. I am not looking for a handout, nor do I ex- pect any sympathy. I simply tell you this in order to have it on the record. Those who are spreading rumors that I live in wealth and comfort are invited to come and verify the situation any time they wish. My door is open. Those who allege that I have counterfeited documents and con- cocted a hoax on the MJ-12 matter had better taken the same facts into account. Rest assured, if I was trying to perpetrate a hoax, I would have played it for all the cash I could get a long time ago and then taken the money and run — as some in the UFO community have already done, and as some are doing even now! And as for my being on the govern- ment's payroll, I can only say that I wish I was. The government pays well and it provides excellent benefits. So why should you believe anything Bill Moore has to say? The fact is that I have information that will add to your knowledge of the UFO phenomenon. I will report it to you in as reliable a fashion as I can, and in as objective a manner as possible. Those of you who have numbered among my friends and supporters will perhaps find it comforting in light of some of the more outrageous rumors that have been circulating throughout the UFO community recently. Others of you who have chosen to cast aspersions and throw rocks in my direction out of fear that I might un- cover something which will upstage your own efforts, will undoubtedly take great pains to dissect what I have to say here in an effort to find more reasons to question my integrity. No matter. In the final analysis, I am not asking you to believe — only to listen. What you do from that point is en- tirely up to you. Two years ago, at the MUFON sym- posium in Washington, D.C., I stood before a similar audience and presented preliminary information on the so-called MJ-12 papers. I also alluded at that time to a series of on- going contacts between myself and a number of well-placed individuals within the government and the in- telligence community. American UFOlogy has been in a turmoil over the MJ-12 matter ever since, with charges and counter-charges being thrown back and forth so fast that it is almost impossible to keep up with them. Worse, the rumor mill, fueled by speculation, disinformation and in- creasingly gross exaggerations on the part of those who ought to know bet- ter, has emerged as a major force which, it sometimes seems from this vantage point, has all but replaced common sense and sound judgement in some circles. What ought to have been a sane and concerted effort to get at the truth, has taken on virtually all the trappings of a three ring circus; and American UFOlogy, as I see it, now stands at the edge of a severe crisis which has already shaken it, as a movement, to its very core. I have every confidence that UFOlogy will survive. Whether it will emerge from this present state of flux with as much credibility as it had going in, however, remains to be seen. I, for one, am somewhat ashamed and embarrassed by the mudslinging that I have witnessed, much of it directed at me, these past two years; and by the in- cessant and increasing rumor- mongering which has tantalized us all by its highly sensational nature and yet, in the final analysis, has offered us so very little in the way of tangible evidence. I hope what I have to say here tonight will have the positive ef- fect of laying some of it to rest, but speaking in all candor, I certainly won't count on it. Throughout our history mankind has witnessed many quests for things which either did not exist, or which, when found, turned out to be something quite different from what was expected. Take for example our medieval ancestors' search for the Ho- ly Grail; the Spanish conquistadores' search for the fountain of youth or the fabled seven cities of gold; the search for Atlantis; or the many archaeolog- ical expeditions mounted in an effort to prove or disprove the more than 1500 year-old legend of King Arthur and his knights of the round table. In every case, it was not the goal so much as the process of the search itself which made a positive contribu- tion to man's knowledge of himself and the planet he lives on. There can be no question that the repeated quests for the Holy Grail played a positive role in increasing medieval Europe's knowledge of the Near East and the ultimate reopening of trade routes which had been closed and all but forgotten about since the time of the fall of Rome more than 500 years before. Equally, although the fountain of youth never existed at all and the fabled seven cities of gold turned out to be pueblos of adobe, the early Spanish explorers' search for these added immensely to Europe's knowledge of New World geography. And in every case, those who study history tell us that there was the in- evitable claque of narrow-minded old fools who, believing that such quests waste time and energy better spent on more useful endeavors, did everything they could to discourage the process and discredit the in- dividuals involved. Alien Factors Pardon my observations, but so it is with our present quest for knowledge about UFOs. Whether UFOs are or are not extraterrestrial is really only a part of the picture. In the final analysis, the process of studying this phenomenon and the people in- volved with it, of assessing the claims and the counter-claims, and of deal- ing with the question of how we, as earthlings, will react to the discovery MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 259 November 1989"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"of a race of extraterrestrial visitors and how they will react to us — all of this and more, when finally looked at in perspective, leads us to the in- escapable recognition that in study- ing the UFO phenomenon, we are at the same time becoming more aware of ourselves as individuals and learn- ing something about the society that we are a part of. The recognition, as noted by my friend Stanton Friedman many years ago, that any alien spend- ing ten minutes looking at planet Earth must come away with the con- clusion that we are, in the eyes of that alien, nothing more than a primitive society whose major activity is tribal warfare, is at once both revealing and powerful. It is through the mirror of UFOs as alien visitors that we ultimately come to look at ourselves and to recognize what and who we really are. Such a process can only prove beneficial to mankind in the long term regardless of what the true nature of the UFOs turns out to be; and those who would stand in its way by attempting to heap derision or ridicule upon the subject do us a grace disservice. Had mankind's greatest inventors, scien- tists, explorers, builders, painters, musicians, composers, physicians, surgeons — the list goes on — the point is, had these people throughout our history heeded the mindless blusterings and ravings of the skep- tics, the scoffers and the debunkers who were present in each and every case, there would be no progress and mankind would still be in the stone age. Moreover, in every case where a breakthrough was achieved and progress was made, it is the achiever who is remembered and honored by history, and not the debunker who said it couldn't be done. The bottom line here is that the UFO phenomenon is a legitimate subject for study by anyone in our free society who chooses to do so. Those who have elected to participate in such a quest should not be held up to deri- sion and ridicule because of it. Those debunkers and UFO-bashers who have nothing positive to contribute are advised to go and massage their egos somewhere else! In my opinion, such people have no right whatsoever to dictate to others what is fit for study 10 and what isn't, or what people should believe and what they shouldn't. Which brings me to my next point. I have been accumulating information on the UFO phenomenon for more than 24 years, the last ten of which have seen my full-time devotion to the subject. During that time, I have wat- ched UFOlogy trying to grow up — trying to achieve respectability with the public, the news media and the scientific community. In that process, I am sorry to say, it has been my observation that we are our own worst enemy. No skeptic, no debunker, could possibly do what we have done to ourselves not once, but time and time again. We say we want respec- tability, yet we have made little effort to construct the foundations necessary to achieve it. Sadly, we have no uniform stan- dards, no professional ethics, no peers, no qualifications, no uniform goals and few credible spokespersons. Nobody speaks for UFOlogy — or rather, perhaps more correctly, everybody speaks for UFOlogy ... all at the same time and each with a dif- ferent voice. Anybody can be a \"UFOlogist.\" All they need to do is tack the title to the end of their name and publish (even self-publish) a book, start a newsletter, or get themselves on television. And should their material be pure unsubstantiated claptrap or broken crockery (read: \"cracked pottery\"), no matter. There's always some other self-styled UFOlogist who will come along, see it as the ultimate wisdom of the universe, and endorse it whole- heartedly, thus adding further to the confusion. Is it any wonder we have degenerated into a host of political camps, each one of which throws rocks at as many of the others as possible while at the same time loudly proclaiming to all who will listen that they are the only true religion? Mean- while, the debunkers, who are essen- tially united under a single banner, throw rocks at all of us; and the public, as hapless observer to the entire pro- cess, emerges more confused than ever. With that in mind, I would like to take a moment to ask each and every member of this audience (or you the reader) to reach down inside yourself and come up with a true answer to a very important and very difficult question. What you say publicly has no meaning in this process. It is what you know inside yourself to be truth that matters. I want you to ask yourself why you are involved with the UFO phenomenon. Do you truly desire answers, no matter what those answers may be and no matter how much those answers may be at variance with what you presently believe about UFOs? Or are you one of those people who thrives on a con- tinuing mystery — whose very posi- tion in the field of UFOlogy requires that the mystery of UFOs be perpet- uated rather than solved so that you can continue in your self-styled role of importance and leadership? Let's suppose you are the head of an organization devoted to the study of UFOs (and there are several such here, including myself). What hap- pens to your organization, and ultimately to you yourself if the UFO mystery is suddenly solved? Do you truly want to see that happen; or is it more palatable and convenient to keep the pot simmering for as long as possible? Only you, and you alone know what it is that motivates you. If you are one who is sincerely in- terested in finding answers, and if you can proceed with an open mind, then I believe I can offer you some inspira- tion and some sense of direction with what I have to say here tonight. If, on the other hand, you are one who prefers to inflate your own image through the spreading of unsubstan- tiated, often alarming and increasingly sensationalistic disinformation, hear- say and rumor, then I urge you to reassess your position and channel your energies along more acceptable lines. If you haven't thought about it, I urge you to do so because I believe we are very near to getting those answers we all claim to want. If the nature of those answers turns out to be such that they will change our world, then I need not point out that individual lives will be changed as well. It is important that we all know where we stand. As for myself, I made a decision a number of years ago as a result of having suddenly found myself face- to-face with an opportunity to learn MUFON JOURNAL No. 259 November 1989"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"more about what our government knows about UFOs. I believed then, and I continue to believe now, that it is possible to uncover answers by searching carefully and completely for them in the right places. Finding those answers and thus ending my so-called career as a UFOlogist poses no prob- lems at all for me. As a writer, I am interested in a variety of subjects, many of them non-UFO related. Should I go as far as I feel I can with the UFO question, I have plenty of other fish to fry — many of which are just as interesting and every bit as challenging. The truth, fellow UFOlogists, is that I have known precisely what I was do- ing all along. It is just that very few other people knew what I was doing, and it was this lack of information on the part of other researchers that has given rise to so much controversy. Consequently, I harbor no grudge against others who have attacked me, sometime bitterly, because they disagreed with my methods, or because they mistook my refusal to answer their often legitimate questions as a display of arrogance and con- tempt. I counseled patience then, and I counsel it now. A rush to judgement is a dangerous and a divisive thing. Those who engage in such practices may sound high-minded and well- informed at first blush, but in the long run they do nothing to enhance their own stature or credibility, and they certainly contribute nothing to our quest for answers. Self Defense Consider the strange case of Mr. Smith, Mr. Jones and the jury. You, the audience (or the reader) are the jury. Mr. Smith is dead. Mr. Jones is being tried for the murder. The pro- secutor stands before you and gives you these facts: \"When the police ar- rived in response to a complaint that a fight was in progress,\" he says, \"Mr. Smith was found lying dead on the floor of his apartment. The cause of death was strangulation, and the body was still warm. Mr. Jones was found bending over the body with his hands still around the victim's throat. Neighbors and others who knew both men have testified that there was con- siderable animosity between the two of them, and that on more than one occasion Mr. Jones was heard to threaten Mr. Smith's safety and well- being. Obviously Jones had gone to see Smith and a violent argument en- sued during which Jones strangled Smith. Unfortunately for Jones, the police arrived before he was able to affect an escape from the scene.\" You're the jury. Is this sufficient evidence to condemn Mr. Jones for murder? I have tried this scenario out during conversations with a number of people over the past few months, and was amazed at how many peo- ple agreed that it is — one of whom was my good friend Walt Andrus, who recently saw fit to publish an outrageously lopsided piece of trash in his newsletter written by a man whom I have never met, spoken to or corresponded with and who could easily have obtained answers to his questions simply by taking the trou- ble to ask. A significant minority who listened to my Smith and Jones scenario, however, hesitated before passing judgement. \"What is Mr. Jones' defense?,\" they wanted to know. And, of course, that's really what it's all about. In the case of Smith and Jones, the truth is that it was Smith who invited Jones to his apart- ment with the intention of quietly do- ing him in and disposing of the body before anyone was the wiser. Jones, however, turned the tables on Smith and accidentally killed him in the pro- cess of self-defense. And so it is in the case of Moore, the government and MJ-12. Those who have already decided that I am one of the bad guys in this controver- sial case have done so on the basis of only half a story. They have rushed to judgement without hearing the defense. \"Hasty pudding,\" as one re- cent tract put it quite humorously — a tract which, by the way, I did not write but which I found to be most appropriate. Unfortunately; I cannot provide you with the entire case for the defense this evening. The reason is that the defense is still in the process of completing its investigation. But I can provide you with a significant part of it — enough so that at least you can begin to understand what I have MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 259 November 1989 been doing and where it is all going. For some of you, it may not be what you want to hear, but it is the truth, at least insofar as I am able to tell it. And it should provide you with a good sense of perspective concerning a lot of other things that have been going on in UFOIogical circles recent- ly. It all began more than ten years ago with a man named Paul Bennewitz. Let me preface my remarks about the Bennewitz case by offering the sincere and candid statement that what I am going to say is, to the best of my knowledge, entirely true. It is offered without malice or prejudice in any way, and is under no circum- stances intended to be libelous or defamatory. I genuinely like Mr. Ben- newitz, continue to regard him as a friend, and have a great deal of sym- pathy for the difficulties he has been through. It is not my intention to up- set him with these revelations, but rather to add a few facts to a record that has been out of balance for a lot of years. I had moved from Minnesota to Arizona during the late summer of 1979, and as a result had become somewhat closer to Jim and Coral Lorenzen of the old Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (or APRO) in Tucson. Ultimately they invited me to become a member of the APRO Board of Directors, and I accepted. It was in this capacity that I first became acquainted with the work being done by Paul Bennewitz and Dr. Leo Sprinkle regarding an alleged UFO abduction involving a young woman and several others which had occurred some time earlier. The woman had been hypnotically regressed by Dr. Sprinkle and had provided a strange account of having witnessed a cattle mutilation in pro- cess and of subsequently having been taken, by her alien abductors, into some sort of craft or facility where these aliens were actively engaged in processing fluids and severed body parts obtained from these cattle. Dur- ing the course of the hypnosis ses- sions, which began as near as I can recall, in August of 1979, Bennewitz had become convinced that the aliens had implanted some sort of com- munication device in the woman's 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"head, and that they were using this device to control her actions. His theory was that they could actually \"see\" what she saw and \"hear\" what she heard by means of this device. In any case, Bennewitz, being a physicist by professison and having a certain amount of electronics equip- ment at his disposal and the wherewithal! to purchase more as needed, set out to determine whether it might be possible to detect the elec- tromagnetic signals he believed these aliens must be using to exercise their control over their alleged victims, and to try to devise a way to shield the vic- tim from the control of these signals. He dubbed this effort \"Project Beta\" and communicated to APRO in late '79 that he believed he had suc- ceeded in detecting low frequency signals from UFOs and had begun to make calculations about the sort of electronic and propulsion technology employed by the aliens. It was also at about this time that Paul began to take both moving and still pictures of strange lights maneuvering in the vicinity of the Manzano Nuclear Weapons Storage Facility which is located to the east of Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, and of which Bennewitz had a perfect view from his residence in the well-to-do Four Hills section of the city. Ben- newitz was convinced that these lights were UFOs and that for some reason they were actively interested in both the Manzano complex and the Coyote Canyon test area located directly south of Manzano on the other side of the hills. During this time, the only aware- ness I had of Bennewitz and his work was what I was obtaining through APRO. I still had not met the man, and in fact was only mildy interested in the case — this based largely upon both Jim and Coral Lorenzen's assess- ment of Bennewitz as a dedicated researcher, but, unfortunately, one who was, as Jim put it, \"prone to make great leaps of logic on the basis of incomplete data.\" Both Jim and Coral felt that Bennewitz had already decided what he was going to find before he went looking for it. Still, although I didn't come to know about it until a few months later, there ap- parently was something going on in- 12 Bennewitz set out to determine whether it might be possible to detect the electromag- netic signals he believed the aliens must be using to control their victims. volving UFOs near Manzano, par- ticularly during August, September and October of 1980, and several agencies of the U.S. government, in- cluding the Air Force Office of Special Investigation, seemed more than just casually interested in it. Birds of Prey? In early September, 1980, I was approached by a well-placed in- dividual within the intelligence com- munity who claimed to be directly connected to a high-level government project dealing with UFOs. This in- dividual, who subsequently came to be known as \"the Falcon,\" told me that he spoke for a small group of similar individuals who were uncom- fortable with the government's con- tinuing cover-up of the truth and in- dicated that he and his group would like to help me with my research into the subject in the hope and expecta- tion that I might be able to help them find a way to change the prevailing policy and get the facts to the public without breaking any laws in the pro- cess. I knew I was being recruited, but at that point I had no idea for what. In any case, I was told that if I was in- terested in cooperating with their group, I would be further contacted by a liaison man and that future meetings between me and \"the Falcon\" would be arranged by this person. The liaison person who subsequently made contact with me was AFOSI agent Richard Doty — a man who has since become quite controversial in his own right and who many people have mistakenly assum- ed is \"the Falcon\" himself. The story of my contacts with \"the Falcon,\" Doty, and subsequently a number of others is something I will have considerably more to say about at a later date. I am fully aware that such a course of action will un- doubtedly prompt the gossip mongers to begin circulating an entirely new ar- ray of outrageous and unsubstantiated rumors, but so be it. My purpose here is to deal only with that part of the story which is directly connected to the Bennewitz affair. To those of you who want to know more after hear- ing what I have to say tonight, I counsel continued patience. You have my assurance that \"the rest of the story\" will ultimately be told as well. But before going back to Ben- newitz, let me make several points which seem appropriate at this junc- ture. First of all, on the question of Richard Doty, and \"the Falcon,\" it is important to note that the name \"Falcon\" was invented by my partner, Jaime Shandera, and I in 1984 strictly as a way of facilitating our talking to each other about this person, par- ticularly on the telephone, without having to use a name. Richard Doty, who continued to be liaison man, was similarly referred to by us as \"the Sparrow.\" Neither \"Sparrow\" nor \"Falcon\" were aware that we were us- ing these terms in reference to them, nor was anyone else to the best of my knowledge, prior to about mid-1985. It was in the mid-1987, just after we went public with the MJ-12 papers, that at \"Falcon's\" suggestion and with the concurrence of Richard Doty, we began dropping subtle hints that \"Falcon\" might in fact be Doty. \"Falcon\" felt that such a ploy would be useful to him in continuing to pro- tect his identity, while Doty, for his part, said that if anybody asked he could simply deny it and that would be that. We quite naturally agreed, and, as many of you are painfully aware, it turned out to be an excellent diversion — particularly with respect to the effect it had following the \"UFO Cover-Up? ... Live!\" show which was broadcast nationally in October 1988. In all fairness to Mr. Doty here, I should also like to comment that, in my assessment, Rick is much better at following the orders and imple- menting the schemes of others than he is at coming up with ideas of his own. Those of you who have devoted MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 259 November 1989"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"time and energy to constantly badger- ing this man for more information should be aware that all you are do- ing is making nuisances of yourself. Rick is not the man you're after — it's the person in the control position that's important here. As far as I'm aware, no one outside of my project has any idea who that person might be, or what his motives are. In any case, it was \"Falcon\" who sought me out in September of 1980, and it was Richard Doty, then with AFOSI at Kirtland AFB, who soon came into play as the middle-man in that process. Shortly thereafter, it became apparent to me that my sup- plying information to the government, through Doty, on the activities of Paul Bennewitz, APRO, and, to a lesser ex- tent, several other individuals, was to be a part of this equation. I also discovered that, whatever it was Ben- newitz was involved with, he was the subject of considerable interest on the part of not one but several govern- ment agencies, and that they were ac- tively trying to defuse him by pump- ing as much disinformation through him as he could possibly absorb. Be- ing a very small part of that process gave me, I thought, something of an advantage. It became my intention to play that advantage for all the infor- mation I could get out of it. Bennewitz, for his part, continued to make what, in my opinion, seemed to be increasingly irrational claims, most of which gave every appearance of having been influenced by a heavy blanket of disinformation mixed with a small, but significant, amount of truth. The problem was always one of keeping a level head and trying to carefully sort the crap from the can- dy — something which Paul didn't seem to me to be very good at. But then, Paul was by that time very emo- tionally involved with the affair and rather skeptical of advice from any quarter unless it supported what he had already decided was the truth. From my vantage point, being de- tached from the mainstream but still close enough to appreciate what was happening, it was somewhat easier to assess the process. I first met Paul in early 1981, and continued contact with him on a fairly regular basis through mid-1985. Con- tact since then has been sporadic. My role in the affair was largely that of a freelancer providing information on Paul's current thinking and activities. I had nothing whatsoever to do with the counterintelligence and the disin- formation, although I either knew or was aware of a number of people directly involved with that end of things. Richard Doty was one of these people; although I came to know Do- ty well enough to gain the impression that he was faithfully carrying out orders which he personally found distasteful. Perhaps it was for this reason that \"the Falcon\" had chosen him as liaison person, although I really don't know. Frankly, I don't believe that Doty does either. In my opinion, he was simply a pawn in a much larger game, just as I was. As for Bennewitz, by 1981, he was gathering data from a variety of sources and amalgamating it with in- formation being fed to him by a number of government people in whom, for some reason, he seemed to have an implicit and abiding faith. The story that emerged from this melange of fact, fiction, fantasy, hear- say, hard data and government disin- formation, was absolutely incredible! Yet somehow, Paul believed in it and set out on a one-man crusade to tell the world that malevolent aliens from space were in league with our govern- ment to take over the planet. What had begun in 1979 as an effort to learn whether the behavior of a woman who claimed she had been abducted by UFO aliens was being in- fluenced by some sort of radio remote control, had, in the space of less than three years, blossomed into a tale which rivaled the wildest science fic- tion scenario anyone could possibly imagine. Basically, it seemed to me that Paul was his own worst enemy. Instead of withholding judgement until all the facts were in, Paul insisted on repeatedly going off half-cocked to virtually anyone who would listen. Members of the press, other UFO researchers, U.S. congressmen and senators, people in military command positions, members of the scientific establishment, even the President himself — all were subjects of Paul's efforts to reach out and tell the world MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 259 November 1989 what he sincerely believed to be hap- pening. He wrote letters and made phone calls by the hundreds. And, to those who had neither the time nor the inclination to look behind the words for a better understanding of the facts, Paul, with his professional credentials and technical vocabulary, came off as a rather credible individual — which must have caused quite a rash of headaches among the people in high places who were desperately trying to defuse him. Essentially, Paul constructed his story using elements derived from four basic sources which can be sum- marized as follows: • Accounts of mysterious and still largely unexplained mutilations of cat- tle which were occurring all over the western United States. These were an on-going phenomenon in the 1979-82 time frame and many peo- ple, including a number of UFO researchers, were on record as hav- ing expressed the belief that UFO aliens were in some way responsible for them. Paul, who had spent a lot of time with a number of people in- volved in these investigations, readi- ly accepted the idea that UFOs had something to do with the phe- nomenon. • An increasing number of UFO cases wherein the individual or in- dividuals involved claimed to have been abducted by UFO aliens and taken aboard their craft against their will. Public exposure to this phe- nomenon got a big boost in 1981 with the appearance of Budd Hopkins' bestseller Missing Time, and Paul was particularly intereseted in these cases. His hypothesis that people were be- ing abducted, implanted with some kind of alien control device, and then being let go again, was completely consistent with the thinking of a number of other UFO researchers at the time. Paul's hypothesis, however, had a somewhat more sinister spin than most. • His own experiments and research regarding the radio signals he was receiving and the photographs and film footage he was getting of unusual lights. Both of these phenomena seemed largely, though not entirely connected with goings-on within the Kirtland AFB/Sandia Na- 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"tional Labs complex just south of the city of Albuquerque. There is no question that Paul was receiving some sort of low frequency electromagnetic signal on his equipment, and it is equally certain that his photos and films do depict unusual lights, most of which were filmed while hovering or maneuvering over the Kirt- land/Sandia complex. The real ques- tion here, however, is whether Paul's evidence is sufficient to conclude that either of these phenomena was directly related to UFO activity, or whether, in fact, a prosaic explanation exists which is more directly related to some classified government research project. Admittedly strong arguments can be made in both direc- tions, either one of which can be of- fered as an adequate explanation of the government's counterintelligence activities in this case. • Government surveillance of Paul and his activities, some of which Paul was astute enough to detect and some of which I had learned about but Paul seemed unaware of. Paul took the surveillance activities, which included wire taps, and, according to Paul, even break-ins, as proof positive that he was onto something big. Un- fortunately, he seemed largely unaware that the same people who would go to such lengths to spy on him also had the capabilities to mount an effective disinformation campaign. Alien Rumors In any case, by mid-1982, Paul's story contained virtually all of the elements found in the current crop of rumors being circulated around the UFO community. There were two groups of aliens, one malevolent, one more friendly. The malevolent one, which Paul referred to as the \"greys,\" were really in control, and they were the ones responsible for the cattle mutilations, for human abductions and the implanting of sinister control devices in humans, for having first made and then broken a secret trea- ty with the U.S. government, for maintaining a secret underground base under Archuleta Peak near Dulce in northwestern New Mexico, and for having supplied the U.S. government with alien space hard- 14 ware and weapons which ultimate- ly proved defective or which were caused to crash, thus leaving human civilization virtually defenseless against invasion. According to Paul, an atomic powered alien ship which they had given to the U.S. government had been caused to crash on Archuleta Peak near the entrance to the alien underground base, and had sprayed the entire area with radioactivity and wreckage. To prove it, he provided drawings, which he said he had made from photographs. I, and others who examined Paul's photographs as well as independently obtained pictures of the same area, were unable to see what Paul claimed was there. Where he saw a crashed ship, burned wreckage, entrances to the alien base, and weapons pointing skyward, others could see only rocks, trees and shadows. I have no doubt that Paul believed that he saw what he claimed, and for this I offer no explanation. I only know that what he claimed to see wasn't what others saw. There is no question that some of Bennewitz' pictures are interesting, but I must say that even though I viewed a large number of them, I never saw one that I could get particularly ex- cited about; and I certainly never saw anything that I felt could be pointed to as proof positive, or even compell- ing evidence that he was photographing alien spacecraft. Much of his film was Super 8 (mm.), which is too small a format for good quality enlargement. There is also no question that Paul was intercepting some kind of low fre- quency electromagnetic emission or signal. The question was and remains, where was it coming from, what was its purpose, and indeed most impor- tantly, was it UFO-related at all? Paul, at least, was convinced that he was receiving alien radio transmissions, and had even gone so far as to develop a home computer program capable of translating them into English. The problem, as I saw it, was that his program, which he claimed had been developed with the assistance of the aliens themselves, assigned entire words, sentence fragments, or sometimes even entire sentences themselves to the various individual pulses of energy within these transmissions. The technique involved was such that it could just as easily have been adapted to assign similar \"alien\" translations to the various energy pulses found in or- dinary Morse code! I have a number of Paul's computer print-outs which contain translations of these allegedly alien messages. If one breaks these apart into their com- ponent words, sentence fragments and sentences, and then shuffles the components, the result is such that the \"new\" message says virtually the same thing as the old one. The messages look fascinating until one examines the method by which they were derived. After that, they were not nearly so interesting. Unfortunate- ly, lots of people saw the messages. Very few had the opportunity to ex- amine the computer program which generated them. Along these same lines, at least some of the things Paul was seeing and identifying as alien spacecraft were definitely not UFOs at all. One evening while visiting him, we went out on his sundeck just at twilight and he pointed out a series of lights slow- ly maneuvering far out over the West Mesa, perhaps 25-30 miles away. These, he said, were alien craft in- volved in abducting people and im- planting them. There certainly were lights maneuvering out there, but even through good binoculars they were not readily identifiable. Paul in- sisted they were UFOs, and showed us how to conduct a little test with our binoculars which, he said, would pro- ve it. Interested, but unconvinced, I drove directly to West Mesa im- mediately after leaving Paul's home and parked my car at a spot where I felt I would be able to get a look at anything flying around that area. Sure enough, helicopters carrying large searchlights began to maneuver slowly over my vantage point only moments after I arrived. One went directly over me at an altitude of perhaps 300', and there is no doubt it was a helicopter. The next day, I called Kirtland AFB and they con- firmed to me that there had indeed been a search-and-rescue training mission in that area the night before. Such operations, they informed me, MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 259 November 1989"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"were conducted over that area quite frequently. That was in 1982. Two years later, in 1984, Paul was still making the same claims about these maneuvering lights to other UFO researchers. As far as I am aware, I was the only one who took the trou- ble to check. Paul is a convincing and compel- ling individual in person. He talks an excellent story and it is easy to see why so many people have been so in- trigued by it over the years. Unfor- tunately, too many of the people who have interviewed Paul have chosen to draw their conclusions about him based solely or largely upon what he says, and not upon the entire body of evidence presented by the larger picture of the case itself. I, too, have spent considerable time with Paul over a period of years and came to know him quite well in that process. As already stated, I viewed a large number of Paul's films and photographs; I carefully examined satellite and aerial survey photographs of both Archuleta Peak and Mesa, as well as aerial photos of the area taken by Paul himself; I examined the com- puter program Paul was using to \"decode\" the alleged alien radio transmissions and communications, and I had a lengthy discussion about this matter with the late Dr. Allen Hynek who had also independently examined Paul's program; I spent considerable time discussing the affair with both Jim and Coral Lorenzen, both of whom were quite skeptical of it (Jim by the way also had a solid pro- fessional background in electronics); and I have copies of many of the reports and letters Paul submitted to APRO beginning as far back as September of 1979. Moreover, as I have already stated, I was personally aware of the intelligence community's concerted efforts to systematically confuse, discourage and discredit Paul be providing him with a large body of disinformation on the subject of UFOs, the malevolent aliens who allegedly pilot them, the technology they employ and the underground bases they supposedly possess and occupy. The entire story of a secret treaty between the U.S. government and the aliens, of exchanges of technology between us and the aliens, of battles between aliens and American armed forces, and of aliens allegedly having implanted hundreds of thousands, even millions, of human beings for the purpose of taking over the world and using us as cattle or slaves, came about as a result of this process. I know, because I was in a position to observe much of this process as it un- folded, and I was providing regular reports on its effectivenes to some of the very people who were \"doing it\" to Paul. And I can tell you that it was effective, because I watched Paul become systematically more paranoid and more emotionally unstable as he tried to assimilate what was happen- ing to him. He had guns and knives all over his house, had installed extra locks on his doors, and he swore that \"they\" (meaning the aliens), were coming through his walls at night and injecting him with hideous chemicals which would knock him out for long periods of time. He told me he had no idea what \"they\" were doing with him while he was knocked out. He began to suffer increasing bouts of insomnia. Others took over the day-to-day operation of his business as he went through this. One day I watched him eat not a bite of his lunch while he chain-smoked 28 cigarettes in 45 minutes. I knew at that time that he was not far from inevitable nervous collapse. His health had deteriorated, he had lost considerable weight, his hands shook as if from palsy, and he looked terrible. I tried to counsel him to drop the entire UFO thing before his health was completely destroyed. He said he knew things were getting bad and he was trying to cope with it. Not long afterward I heard he had been hospitalized and was under psychiatric care. Whether UFOs were actually ever involved with all of this and to what extent, I never really knew. Perhaps Paul had merely stumbled upon signals generated from some sophisticated, high-level government project whose security people hit upon UFO-related disinformation as the ultimate cover. Or perhaps he had discovered a real, although somewhat less sensational (if, in fact that's pos- sible), government UFO project which MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 259 November 1989 elected to disinform him to protect what they were really doing. I do know from first-hand experience that there was a tremendous amount of government disinformation involved, and that a large proportion of what we are hearing today about malev- olent aliens, underground bases and secret treaties with the U.S. govern- ment has its roots firmly planted in the Bennewitz affair. Stories of an alleged UFO crash at Aztec, New Mexico, are also a part of this picture, but I'll save comment on that until later. In any case, from what I knew of all of this, it's purpose was strictly to discredit Bennewtiz, nothing more. What amazes me is that, near- ly a decade later, these same stories continue to circulate! Recently, one of the most promi- nent figures in the current disinforma- tion wave which has been sweeping the UFO and New Age communities was quoted as having stated that he has found Paul Bennewitz's informa- tion to be \"100% true.\" This person spent a couple of days talking to Paul back in the summer of 1987, and has spent considerable time since spreading elaborate and increasingly sensationalistic stories based, he claims, on information gathered from a variety of unnamed sources. Strip away the fluff, and what you have left is essentially the Bennewitz story all over again. There is no ques- tion in my mind that it's mostly disin- formation, pure and simple. And, since connections can be shown to exist between those who are spreading it now and those who were spreading it then, both from the Ben- newitz angle and from within the in- telligence community, it seems reasonable to assume that those responsible for it are not satisfied that their task has been completed, even after all this time. Knowing what is go- ing on, however, is simply not enough. The real question is \"Why?\" Disinformation It was just that question I asked myself when I first ran into the disin- formation operation that was being run on Bennewitz. It seemed to me at that time that I was in a rather uni- que position. There I was with my 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"foot literally in the door of a secret counterintelligence game that gave every apperance of being somehow directly connected to a high-level government UFO project, and, judg- ing by the positions of the people I knew to be directly involved with it, definitely had something to do with national security! There was no way I was going to allow the opportunity to pass me by without learning at least something about what was going on. Many UFOlogists have run up against disinformation over the years. Virtually all of them viewed it as a negative process and backed away from it either in anger or disgust as soon as they discovered what they were dealing with. Even today, the UFO community unanimously con- siders anyone known or suspected of dealing in disinformation as one of the \"bad guys\" — to be shunned or avoided at all costs, and certainly never ever to be believed. I deter- mined to take quite a different tack. I would play the disinformation game, get my hands dirty just often enough to lead those directing the process into believing that I was doing exactly what they wanted me to do, and all the while continue to burrow my way in- to the matrix so as to learn as much as possible about who was directing it and why. It would be a classic case of turning the tables on the very ones who were most confident they had the situation well in hand. There was just one thing I needed to do this — Secrecy! I couldn't tell anyone about what I was doing; for if I did and word got back to those in control, I would be immediately cut off and cast adrift before I could learn anything. It was a formidable problem. Some of the contacts I had made during the Bennewitz affair seemed friendly and professed a desire to end the UFO cover-up and assist in getting govern- ment information on UFOs out to the public in a slow and methodical man- ner so as not to create a panic. Others seemed more interested in obtaining information from me, often on what other members of the UFO communi- ty were doing and sometimes on other completely unrelated subjects. Whatever information I managed to get from these individuals in return usually came as a result of asking 16 just the right questions in just the right ways. Sometimes it took months, or even years of establishing a relation- ship with someone before anything useful came out of it. The most difficult part of it all was trying to determine what was real and what was processed bull fodder. One of the key factors in any successful disinformation scheme is that it must contain some elements of truth in order to be credible. Knowing that, however, is one thing. Doing something with it is quite another. When you're dealing with what you know to be a classified program and you're determined to get information without breaking any laws and runn- ing afoul of national security, you're walking a very fine line. That's why it took so long to come up with any results. In June of 1982, I approached my friend Jaime Shandera and brought him into the project. At that time, I also began briefing Stanton Friedman as to what was going on. Both of them knew that I was in contact with a number of people within the in- telligence community on the subject of UFOs, and both were aware that at least some of the information conn- ing through was disinformation, but both had only minimal knowledge of the private goals and conclusions I had established some months earlier. As the project progressed, this actually turned out to me more of an asset than a drawback. Indeed, the three of us were an excellent team in that we each approached the problem from a different angle. From my point of view, the process was one of slowly and methodically burrowing into a beehive from the outside with a goal of ultimately reaching the queen bee and the royal jelly at the center. Since I never knew whether the other bees I was certain to meet along the way would be friendly or not, I had to proceed cautiously both in order to avoid get- ting stung and to learn as much as possible about what might lie ahead. The control factor, as I saw it, rested largely with me and the way I proceeded. Jaime, on the other hand, saw it as a somewhat different process. He too felt we were burrowing into a beehive, but in his view of things, our burrow- ing was at the express invitation of the queen bee herself who clandestinely oversaw and encouraged the process from a distance as part of her private plan to get free of the politics that sur- rounds and restrains her. As long as we followed the signposts along the way, Jaime felt, the learning process would continue and we could never get stung. Stanton, as the scientist of the group, was the one best qualified to assess the nature of the informa- tion we were getting and to conduct a careful and organized search for cor- roborating witnesses and evidence in places outside of the loop Jamie and I were part of. By the way, just as a matter of per- sonal privilege here, I would like to react to a nasty comment about Stan- ton which appeared in a recent issue of Jim Moseley's Saucer Smear newsletter. In this comment, the writer, after first characterizing Stan- ton as a \"gullible\" individual, went on to wonder whether he could be trusted to expose the MJ-12 documents as phoney if his research turned up conclusive evidence to that effect. It's a legitimate question and I would like to answer it by stating that not only Stanton, but all of us were firmly committed to releasing a full and complete report on this matter. If evidence should come to light sug- gesting that the douments are phoney, you have my firm assurance that it will most certainly be included in our report. \"Gullibility\" is not an issue here. The matter is far larger than that. In any case, Stanton, Jaime and I are all working towards the same goal — that of trying to discover what is truth and what isn't with respect to the U.S. government and UFOs. It's not a new thing with us, it's a project that's been underway for quite a few years. My role in the Bennewitz affair had at least secured me a seat in the right theater. From there it was only a ques- tion of whether I could use my bal- cony ticket to discover who owned the place and was making the major operational decisions. Both Jamie and I felt that in order to have any hope of success at all, we absolutely had to play the game according to Continued on page 18 MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 259 November 1989"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Current Case Log By Dan Wright Wright is MUFON's deputy direc- tor of investigations.

Log # 890405. 2/8/89 event of 12-minute duration in Gulf Breeze, FL; investigators, Carol and Rex Salisberry. At 3:38 a.m., a man was awakened by his barking dogs. He observed a 3-foot (dumbbell-like) disc, bathed in light, descending to a land- ing 60 feet away on a vacant lot. It then displayed small green and red- orange blinking lights. A 12-year-old son accompanied him to the door and watched from there. The man proceeded outside and slowly ap- proached, intending to bring the ob- ject back inside. He detected a sizzl- ing sound. As he shone his flashlight on the object, a brilliant flash encom- passed it and it appeared to vanish (i.e. without accelerating away). No marks were evident on the ground afterward. [Note: The same man had reported an observation on the morn- ing of the November 1987 date when Ed Walters took his original five Polaroid photos.] Log #890406. 11/24/87 event of 5-minute duration in Gulf Breeze, FL; investigator, Boots Eckert. At 7:30 p.m., a woman and her son noticed a light in the sky as they drove. It approached and hovered over trees along the road, discernible as a disc perhaps 30 feet in diameter and seeming to spin. A single row of windows displayed alternating red and white lights. A red ball of light dropped from the underside, moved laterally away, then up and out of sight. [Note: The mother and son observed what was believed the same vehicle on 2/12/88.] Log #890407. 11/10-20/87 (ap- proximation) event of 3-minute dura- tion in Pensacola, FL; investigator, Vicki Lyons. At dusk, while driving a couple noticed an object hovering at treetop level and described as disc- shaped and van-sized, with a light blue-grey surface, bright white light at the top and a white light band covering the bottom perimeter. They slowed and kept the object in view for 2-3 miles until passing out of viewing range. [Note: Claiming not to have heard about the Gulf Breeze incidents at that point, they later came forward due to perceived ridicule aimed at Ed Walters in order to establish that they had viewed an identical vehicle;] Log # 890502. 4/5/89 event of 5-minute duration in Cantonment, FL; investigators, Carol and Rex Salisberry and Terry Kussart. About 11 p.m., a 14-year-old girl noticed a slowly descending light from her bedroom window. She went outside and observed a dark grey disc, 15-20 feet in diameter and hovering over a tree, causing the branches to move vigorously. Dozens of blue-streaked white lights shone around its rim. A \"door\" opened in the bottom, il- luminating the tree. She ran inside to call a friend and neighbor (noticing heavy static on the line). The second girl, also 14, proceeded outside and observed the vehicle as it departed vertically and out of sight, spinning as it went.

At 8:45 p.m., a woman sported low over her backyard an ob- ject shaped like a \"long bow tie\" (30-foot length) with a brilliant red- orange bar of light on one side. The object appeared to vanish (i.e. without accelerating out of sight). [Note: Due to her emotional reaction and difficul- ty recalling specifics in the ensuing weeks, the woman began hypnosis sessions, from which earlier en- counters with disc-shaped vehicles in 1925 and 1939 were related.] MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 259 November 1989 Lot # 890602. 10/21/78 event of 3-minute duration in Dayton, OH; in- vestigator, David Miller. At 3 p.m., a man (licensed pilot) was working in his yard when he noticed a chrome- like ball at high altitude which crossed existing vapor trails, transformed to a flat-white, stopped, transformed to grey, then accelerated vertically through cirrus clouds. [Note: As in- dicated by the witness, a local TV sta- tion reported other concurrent observations.] Log # 890603. 1/18/89 event of over 1-hour duration near Somerville, OH; investigator, Dick Seifried. At 3:57 a.m., a man (retired USAF non- com) was awakened by his barking dog. Looking out, he observed three oval shapes over trees bordering the property 50 yards away. He woke his wife and two adolescent children. The family watched for most of two hours as the objects moved low over near- by farm buildings and land. They displayed various bright colors (amber, red, green, blue and white) which covered the surfaces from an apparent belt of lights on each. At one point, the father and son engaged in a chase with their auto before losing sight of them. Shortly thereafter, two of the objects returned over an adja- cent field before departing again.

At 10 p.m., a couple noted on their police monitor that cars were stopped along a Lake Huron shoreline highway. From their balcony, they observed at a distance a huge apparently disc-shaped object with numerous green lights or lighted windows around the perimeter. A soft whrring sound was detectable. The vehicle hovered near the shore, then moved off over the lake and out of sight.

At 9:15 p.m., a man reacted to his bark- ing dogs and proceeded outside. Within a few hundred feet and hover- ing overhead was a disc (estimated 90-foot diameter) with a brilliant white centered light on the undercarriage. Window-like sections encompassed the perimeter. A humming sound was heard. He retreated inside, grabbed a .22 caliber rifle, went back outside and aimed. At that moment, a beam of light engulfed him and the weapon misfired.

Two women were driving when they noticed a bright light through the trees bordering the road. The light ap- peared to pace their auto. Having lost sight of it, they rounded a bend and discovered a disc (estimated 20-foot diameter) hovering low over the road. A red light on top blinked, while two bands of lights flashed randomly in red, yellow and green. Whiteness engulfed the undercarriage. The witnesses stopped 100 yards away. The husband of one, who had been following in another vehicle, arrived too late to see the object ascend out of sight.

At 2:57 a.m., two women were driving when they spotted a whitish ovular object in the sky overhead with large red, beacon-sized flashing lights along the side and bright white encompassing the bottom. They stopped and exited the car for a better look. As they watched, the object vanished (i.e. without accelerating out of sight).

A woman and her adolescent daughter noticed a bright light low in the distance while driving home. Reaching their driveway, they observed a saturn-shaped disc (12-15 feet in diameter) which stopped and hovered 50 yards away, 30-40 feet above the ground. A row of multi- colored lights (undefined) formed a band around the middle. They perceived it \"bounce up and down\" and last observed it while running in- to the house. Log # 890708. 4/5/89 event of undetermined duration near Plain- field, IN; investigator, Norma Croda. Perhaps around 3 a.m., the original reporting witness awoke with bright light shining on her, discovering a disc 200 feet from her window. The ob- ject displayed two rows of amber, blue and white lights. She immediately fell back asleep. Separately, a neighbor- ing man awoke to his growling dog and observed a brilliant white light in the same location, believing the time to be 2:00-2:30 a.m. After trying to return to sleep, he arose and spotted it again, then found himself standing in another room without knowing how he arrived there.

The witness awoke with light filling her bedroom. Outside her window 30-50 feet hovered a disc perhaps 10-20 feet in diameter (stated as twice that of a satellite dish) with a red flickering light centered on the bottom and unde- fined light forming a rim. Gold rays of light appearing solid like icicles emanated from the object toward her window, appearing to end abruptly at the glass pane. Each ray displayed a tiny centered red portion as well as a surrounding halo effect. After a mo- ment, the tiny object and rays disap- peared (i.e. without appearing to ac- celerate out of sight). Several additional case reports received in the final week of July were yet to be evaluated and summarized at this writing. The most significant among them will be included in the next appearance of this log. MOORE, Continued \"their\" rules. That meant doing everything possible to give the ap- pearance that we were essentially \"useful idiots\" who would cause no trouble, while at the same time play- ing the double game of keeping our eyes and ears open in order to learn as much as we could about what was going on. In so doing, we were gradually able to expand our base of friendly contact with people, while working our way further and further into the truly bizarre intelligence labyrinth that surrounds the subject of UFOs. I have no problem in telling you that it has been a tedious, time and resource consuming task which has been made all the more difficult by the constant barrage of rock and bottles thrown in our direction from a seg- ment of the UFO community which, out of ignorance, chose to take up un- friendly and unsympathetic positions toward us. Were it not for the fact that we were constantly challenged by the twists and turns of our project and by the hope that we could ultimately come away from it with a smoking gun in hand, I am convinced we would have thrown in the towel a long time ago. Indeed, I must admit that there were several occasions when we tried to do just that, only to be en- couraged to continue by some of our \"friends\" from the inside who had come to believe in what we were do- ing and respected us for it.

State Di- rector Maine; Date of Sighting: 7/22/89; Date of Interview: 8/12/89 At 3:30 p.m. on July 22, 1989, Randy Rhodes, a police dispatcher for the City of Ellsworth, Maine, and Bill Reiff, an attorney who resides in Somesville, Maine, took off in Reiff's Beachcraft Bonanza V-35 from the Bar Harbor-Trenton airport. Their in- tention was to fly to Boothbay Har- bor to see the Friendship Sloop Regatta. Reiff, who was at the con- trols had 250-300 hours of flying time and Rhodes was a former military communications technician and com- mercial pilot with 4500 hours of fly- ing time. It was a clear, blue day with no clouds in the sky. At approximately 3:45 p.m. over Blue Hill Bay between Bartlett's Island and Long Island, at an altitude of 4500 feet and a speed of 150 knots, Rhodes felt that there was another plane near them. He looked behind them to see a Cherokee 180 estimated to be at a somewhat lower altitude of 1000 feet. Still feeling that there was something else in the area as Reiff banked the aircraft on a 10-degree turn to the right in a climbing altitude, Rhodes saw, at what he described as a 9 o'clock position, an oval-shaped ob- ject, looking like polished or brushed aluminum and having distinct edges. Rhodes was puzzled because there was no vapor stream and wondered if it could be a reflection on the wind- shield from something on the water like a boat or a metal building roof on the ground in the distance. He observed that there were no boats in the area and no metal roofs visible. Before saying anything to Reiff, he moved his outstretched hand up and down across the cockpit to block any light possibly causing a reflection, but there was no effect — the object still appeared distinct and unobscured. Having observed the object for 5-10 seconds, he pointed it out to Reiff. \"What is it?\" was Reiff's response. \"I don't know. Is it an airplane?\" Rhodes asked. \"No, it doesn't look like an air- plane,\" Reiff suggested as he turned the plane to keep it in view as it started moving from the 9 o'clock to the 11 o'clock position. Now it was at the same altitude as their plane — ap- proximately 5100-5200 feet. Rhodes said that his immediate reaction was to turn around and get Reiff's video camera from the back seat, but to his surprise this was one of the rare times Reiff didn't bring it along. As the object suddenly moved again dead ahead at the 12 o'clock position, it took on what Rhodes described as a red, rose or pinkish col- or. Then it moved away in a south- westerly direction at a very high rate of speed getting smaller until it disap- peared. Since the sky was clear blue and there were no clouds in the vicini- ty of the object, Rhodes found it im- possible to estimate the size or the distance of the object. \"It could have been anything from 20 miles down to 5 miles from us,\" was Rhodes' state- ment. They observed no visible mark- ings on the object. Reiff asked Rhodes what he wanted to do, and Rhodes suggested that with this \"thing\" out there he was not very enthusiastic about traveling further. So they turned back for the Bar Harbor-Trenton airport. Rhodes recalls that the ADF (Aerial Direction Finder) was working at the time, but the DME (Distance Measur- ing Equipment) was not receiving. It had never before given them a prob- lem, always showing good reception within 60-80 miles from the airport. There was no reception. He tried the selector switch by setting it at 108.3, but it was not receiving. Three to four minutes after the object disappeared, while on their way back to the airport, MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 259 November 1989 the DME came on. Over Blue Hill they called the Bangor Airport Radar and were located. When they landed back at the Bar Harbor-Trenton airport, and began their drive home, they discovered that the radio in Reiff's Jaguar was not working. After a few minutes it came on, and the announcer said that there had been power surges and dif- ficulties, and they don't know what was happening. Rhodes later recalled that when the observed object was last seen, it was moving in the direction of the Maine Yankee Nuclear Power Plant in Wiscasset. However, a spokesman for the Bangor Hydro- Electric Company later reported that an outage was caused by three limbs falling over a wire when a resident felled a tree. The air traffic manager at the Bangor airport indicated that they never lose radar service because of the use of auxiliary generators. When Rhodes and Reiff called the ATC (Air Traffic Controllers) at the Bangor airport and got in touch with the person who had contacted them on radar, this person remembered that there was no other object visible ex- cept the airplane behind them at a lower altitude. It was further reported that no airlines were coming in from Europe (Rhodes said that he and Reiff never got out that far on this occasion), and there were no military aircraft in the area from the Bangor airport or the Brunswick Naval Air Station. Following this event, Rhodes and Reiff began checking with other peo- ple in the area. They found that there had been one sighting the day before from an Earl Beechland. Two fisher- men, Wendell Seavey and Barry Thomas confirmed sightings at other times saying, \"Fishermen have seen things; we know what you are talk- ing about.\" This investigation was done jointly by Leland Bechtel and Robert MacKenna (MUFON Members) who both thought that the credibility of the witness (Rhodes) was high. He had 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"never seen such an object before, although as a military communi- cations technician he had tracked UFOs on radar from an aircraft car- rier in the Gulf of Tonkin. He reported that he and Reiff had separately drawn sketches of the object they had seen and they were identical. He did report that when he was 9-10 years of age while in the Clovis, New Mexico area where he was born and raised, his father, mother, and he had gone out into the country to try out his new shotgun. While they were getting it out of the car trunk, with their heads down in the trunk, there was a bright green light that flooded the area. \"Oh, My God, what was that?\" ex- claimed his mother. \"What's the matter?\" replied his father. His mother \"turned white\" as she said, \"Something green in color just passed over us.\" Although his mother saw an object, he reported that he did not. Other than this incident and the fact that he was aware of the well- publicized Socorro, New Mexico in- cident involving a police officer, he could report no other knowledge of an actual sighting. As a witness, he was internally consistent, highly ra- tional, keenly observant, and com- mendably precise expressing himself in graduated terms as the facts war- ranted. He appeared sincerely con- cerned about discovering the nature of the UFO phenomenon. UFO Landing vith Entities in U.S.S.R. By Walt Andrus The Tass News Agency release to the world on October 9, 1989 of an announced UFO landing in a Voronezh city park, witnessed by numerous children, with three very tall humanoids accompanied by a small robot parading around the park, has electrified the printed press and electronic news media unlike any UFO event in the past two decades. One could speculate and arrive at many reasons why this announce- ment so shocked not only the worldwide press, but the U.S. media in particular. Such an announcement from Tass, the staid and very conser- vative government controlled news agency, was so out-of-character that it gave a certain amount of credibility to the event. The first reaction conjured by many people was that the announcement was reminiscent of the typical tabloids displayed in supermarkets. Ufologists were quick to note that the entities described were in direct contradiction to those reported in North America, which made everyone justifiably suspicious and definitely very skep- tical of the authenticity of the report. If the news release is indeed substan- tially true, this is a major breakthrough for Ufology, because a world power has officially announced an event that is familiar to knowledgeable ufologists. Considering the statements made by former President Ronald Reagan related to cooperation between the 20 U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A. if we were in- vaded from space, the Voronezh an- nouncement might imply that the Russians had performed a scientific coup to embarrass the United States government into disclosing its vast knowledge of UFOs. If this scenario has any validity whatsoever, ufologists and the citizens of the planet Earth have moved into a new era in our space program. Conversely, if the Tass News Agen- cy release is just a grand hoax to at- tract attention and sell newspapers, we must expose that fact immediately. As an editorial policy, the MUFON UFO Journal does not publish newsclippings of UFO sightings until they are investigated and documented. The potential implica- tions of the U.S.S.R. story are so great that the editors have elected to share this information with our members and subscribers. After a thorough in- vestigation is conducted by our representatives in the U.S.S.R., their report will be published in the Jour- nal. If the story is substantially a hoax, Journal readers will be the first to know. On the other hand, if it is true, the editors have fulfilled a primary responsibility to our readers — to keep you informed. Preliminary Report This is a preliminary report reconstructed from the Tass News Agency releases dated October 9 and 10 and the daily newspaper Soviet- skaya Kultura. Variations do exist be- tween the descriptions of the entities given by the witnesses to the in- dividual reporters. Location of landing: City park in Voronezh (Ukraine) U.S.S.R. Voronezh is a city of more than 800,000 people located 300 miles southeast of Moscow. Date and time of landing: September 27, 1989; 6:30 p.m. (local time). The Tass News Agency report was filed by Vladimir V Lebedev, age 59, a 20-year veteran Tass reporter, on October 4 and then again on October 9, when it was finally used by the Tass foreign service. He said he based his report upon conversations with dozens of witnesses and with experts who had examined the evidence and spoken to the children. Lebedev said there were about three landings of the UFO from September 23 to 29, however he has not personally witnessed any of the landings in Voronezh. He said he believes that \"something had happened\" because, otherwise the youngsters would not have been so frightened. According to the original Tass report (October 9) by Lebedev, a large shining ball or disk was seen hover- ing over the park by Voronezh residents. They saw the UFO land and up to three creatures similar to MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 259 November 1989"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"humans emerge, accompanied by a small robot. \"The aliens were 3 or even 4 meters (9 to 12 feet) tall, but with very small heads,\" the news agency quoted witnesses as saying. \"They walked near the ball or disk and then disappeared inside.\" A daily newspaper, Sovietskaya Kultura (Soviet Culture) said its coverage was motivated by \"the golden rule of journalism: The reader must know everything.\" This is their version of the UFO landing on September 27 at 6:30 p.m. It said \"boys playing soccer saw a pink glow in the sky, then saw a deep red ball about 10 yards in diameter. The ball circled, vanished, then reappeared minutes later and hovered. A crowd rushed to the site, and through an open hatch saw a \"three-eyed alien\" about 9 feet tall, clad in silvery overalls and bronze-colored boots, and wear- ing a disk on his chest. Two boys and a girl from a local school, Vasya Surin, Zhonya Blinov and Yulbija Sholokhova, who had been playing in the park, were in- terviewed, providing the above descriptions. Lt. Sergei A. Matveyev of the Voronezh police station said he saw the landing on September 27th. He confessed that he hadn't actually seen the alien, but said he saw the spaceship and \"it was certain- ly a body flying in the sky,\" moving noiselessly at a very high speed and very low altitude. Lt. Matveyev specifically said \"It was not an optical illusion.\" To be honest, he said, he was a little skeptical when he first saw the object. Genrikh Silanov, head of the Voronezh Geophysical Laboratory, told Tass that scientists investigating the UFO report found a 20-yard depression with four deep dents. Silanov said the landing site and path taken by the aliens was confirmed using the \"biolocation\" method of tracing. (He failed to explain what \"biolocation\" was.) Mr. Lebedev, the Tass reporter, said Mr. Silanov asked the children on Tuesday, October 10 to draw what they had seen. Though isolated from one another, he said, the children all drew a banana-shaped object that left behind in the sky the sign of the let- ter X. Dr. Vladimir V. Rubtsov Vladimir A. Moiseyev, director of the regional health department, said that despite reports of widespread fear in the city, none of the witnesses had applied for medical help. But he said, \"Certainly, we are planning to ex- amine the children.\" Meanwhile, a Tass editor said two Moscow-based reporters had been dispatched to Voronezh to check on the report filed by the local Tass correspondent Vladimir Lebedev, a man he termed a \"very serious\" journalist. Lebedev seemed insulted that anyone would treat the story with anything but full seriousness. MUFON Alerted The MUFON International Director obtained the first communication about the landing in the U.S.S.R. at 7:00 a.m. COST on October 9, 1989 when a long distance telephone call was received from the Sun newspaper in London, England. The original Tass News Agency report was read to Walt Andrus, carrying the dateline MOSCOW, October 9. I was asked to comment upon the report for publica- tion in England. Obviously, this was very difficult under the circumstances. I felt that the case definitely required a serious investigation due to its source — the U.S.S.R. government- controlled news agency which nor- mally does not joke about such incidents. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 259 November 1989 It was pointed out to the Sun reporter that a wide discrepancy ex- isted between the description of the aliens reported by witnesses com- pared to those reported in North America. As an investigative agency, we could not make further comments until a full scale investigation was launched in Voronezh by our representative in the U.S.S.R., Dr. Vladimir V. Robtsov, or his colleagues in Kharkov. On Tuesday morning, October 10, Walt Andrus was interviewed by Ms. Maura Webber, of the Tass News Agency in New York City, who was seeking the reaction of the public and the UFO community to the Tass an- nouncement so she could file a report to the U.S.S.R. My response was similar to the statement given to the Sun newspaper. She wanted to know what the \"biolocation method of tracking\" was, but I was unable to define it. I considered this interview extremely interesting even though it shed no further light on the authen- ticity of the UFO landing — or did it? Interview With Vladimir V. Rubtsov, Ph.D. Constant interviews for two days by newspaper and radio stations prevented me from obtaining an in- terview with the MUFON represen- tative in the U.S.S.R. to solicit his help. The havoc created by the news had 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"tied up every telephone line to Russia. It was necessary to place my calls to coincide with the hours that Dr. Rubt- sov would be in his home and not teaching at the university in Kharkov. Finally, through the aid of Ben Baldwin, host of the WOAI radio talk show program \"Road Across America,\" an appointment was made at 2:00 a.m. (COST) on Saturday, October 14th to interview Vladimir from his home. (Saturday noon in Kharkov.) Dr. Rubtsov speaks relatively good English, therefore we did not have a language barrier problem in convers- ing. Earlier in the week, I had filed an airmail letter with the original news releases to Vladimir seeking his assistance in the investigation and documentation of the Tass report. It was apparent at the beginning of the interview that Dr. Rubtsov had only the same news agency reports that had been transmitted to foreign coun- tries as we possessed. Due to the fact that many of the witnesses were children, he felt that there were no serious witnesses. When we quizzed him about scientists confirming the report, he was unable to second this, since he had not launched his own in- vestigation. He advised that there were strong local UFO groups in the major cities in the U.S.S.R., such as Kharkov, Moscow, Kiev, Leningrad and Voronezh, to name but a few. Based upon a CNN-TV interview in Voronezh with two apparently competent UFO investigators, I knew that a local investigation was in pro- gress. The distance from Kharkov to Voronezh is 400 kilometers, per Dr. Rubtsov, which presented a problem of having the Kharkov UFO group conduct the prime investigation. He wanted to drive to Voronezh over the weekend to interview the witnesses and scientists, but was not sure dur- ing the telphone interview that this could be accomplished, since it was already noon on Saturday. Vladimir was not sure whether the case was legitimate or not since he did not have immediate access to the investigation by the Voronezh UFO group. When Ben Baldwin asked him about UFO cases in general in the U.S.S.R. his reply was the following: 10 to.15% of the reports are credible Looking Back by Bob Gribble FORTY YEARS AGO - November 1949: Several farmers were driving near Oxford, Mississip- pi, at 9:30 a.m. on the 16th when they spotted a whitish-gray, cylindrical-shaped object moving about 60 feet in the air. Upright and approximately two feet in diameter and tapered at one end, the craft drifted along at some 30 to 40 miles per hour. It was in sight for ten minutes and the witnesses could hear no sound. Two days later a similar ob- ject was seen by four witnesses south of Raceland, Louisiana. The craft was shiny and similar in shape to an air- craft fuselage but without protruding appendages of any sort. No lights or sounds were associated with the 9:30 a.m. sighting. Before fading from view the vehicle made two 90-degree turns. About 10 a.m. on the 18th, 22 several guards at the Biloxi, Mississip- pi, Veterans Hospital observed a white-colored, cigar-shaped object about 200 feet long. No sound was detected as the craft moved about 50 miles per hour at an estimated altitude of 3000 feet. The vehicle was in view for about 25 minutes. * * * THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO - November 1954: Jose Alves was fishing in the Pardo River near Pon- tal, Brazil, on the night of the fourth when he spotted a strange object descending with a wobbling motion. The craft landed so close to him that he could have touched it. The vehi- cle had the shape of \"two wash-bowls placed together\" rim-to-rim, and was between 10 and 15 feet in diameter. as unexplained sightings; he has per- sonally investigated several dozen reports in the Kharkov area; and UFO sighting reports are now currently be- ing published in the local newspapers. When we questioned him about the discrepancy in the height of the aliens compared to the U.S.A., he said \"height is only the estimate of the witnesses — this is only a report.\" As the MUFON representative for the U.S.S.R., I tried to impress upon him the importance of launching a full scale investigation either by the Kharkov UFO group or in conjunction with the Voronezh UFO group, based upon the worldwide interest that the sighting has created. It is imperative that the truth be known. As expressed by the Soviet- s/caya Kultura newspaper in their mot- to, the golden rule of journalism is that \"the reader must know everything.\" The SKYLOOK motto was \"We tell it like it is.\" We hope to have an in- vestigation report directly from the U.S.S.R. by Dr. Rubtsov in a future issue of the Journal. Too terrified to move, Alves watched three little men in white clothing and closefitting skull-caps emerge from the craft. Their skin appeared to be quite dark. They gathered samples of grass, herbs and leaves of trees. One filled a shiny metal tube with water from the river. The occupants re-entered the vehicle which ascended swiftly, silent- ly, and vertically and vanished. On the 14th, a rabbit farmer at Isola, in northern Italy, watched in amazement as a cigar-shaped object landed on his farm. Out of the craft came three small dwarfish beings, dressed in what appeared to be metallic diving suits. Their interest was centered on the rabbit cages. He raised the rifle he was carrying and tried to shoot at them but it would not fire. It became so heavy in his hands that he had to drop it. The occupants, making strange noises amongst themselves, loaded his rabbits in their vehicle and took off soundlessly. While all of this was going on the MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 259 November 1989"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"farmer stood paralyzed and could not move or speak. He experienced a \"tingling\" sensation like that of a mild electric shock. There were no lasting effects of this condition. In Brazil, one close encounter came perilously close to tragedy. It was the night of the 21st, and a Brazilian airliner, bound for Rio de Janeiro, was cruising along in the dark. Flying at 8000 feet, the aircraft was over the Paraiba River when a strange glow suddenly appeared ahead. In a mo- ment a weird formation took shape — 19 round craft, each more than 100 feet in diameter. Glowing like hot metal, the mysterious vehicles ap- proached at supersonic speed. Before the pilot could move his controls, the crafts were flashing past and beneath his wings. As several vehicles streaked by the cabin, the 13 passengers stam- peded. One woman, screaming, ran into the pilot's compartment. Another passenger, battling a crewman, tried to reach the main exit. For two or three minutes the cabin was a mad- house. With the danger of a crash mounting, crewmen had to use force. The frightened passengers were finally subdued, and the airliner landed safely. At 2 a.m. on the 28th, Gustavo and Jose Ponce were driving a van in the suburbs of Caracas, Venezuela, when they found the road ahead blocked by a sphere some 8 to 10 feet wide and hovering about six feet from the ground. Investigating, Gonzales had a fight with a bristly, hairy, dwarf-like being which, though seemingly very light in weight, was so strong that it knocked Gonzales a distance of 15 feet with a mere push. With glowing eyes it lunged at him. He drew his knife and stabbed at it, but the knife glanced off its body as though from steel. Another occupant then emerged from the craft and blinded Gonzales with a beam of dazzling light from a small tube. Meanwhile, Jose Ponce watched two more of the beings emerging from the bushes with their arms full of what seemed to be earth MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 259 November 1989 or rocks. With great ease they jumped up into the hovering sphere. All the occupants wore loin-cloths. Ponce fled to the nearest police sta- tion, and Gonzales arrived there shortly afterwards, overcome with ex- haustion and fright. ^ The police thought at first they both were drunk, but soon found that such was not the case. Gonzales had a long deep red scratch on his side, and the two men were given sedatives and placed under medical observation for several days. One of the doctors treating them later admitted to them that he knew their story was true, as he had been driving back from a night-call at the time and had actually seen the en- counter. According to UFO inves- tigators in Caracas, this doctor subse- quently went to Washington, D.C, to discuss the case with American authorities. * ** THIRTY YEARS AGO - November 1959: Police Chief Glen Sheppard of Alvin Texas, started laughing when a passerby handed him a message from the stranded driver of a gasoline tanker truck on the morning of the eighth. \"A UFO flew over my truck and its powerful rays caused the truck engine to stop running. I need help!\" The chief stopped laughing when the passerby declared: \"That UFO is still out there.\" Chief Sheppard and Patrolman S. Garrett went out to see just what kind of help the truck driver needed. The truck driver told the Alvin officers and tow truck driver that the UFO had followed him all the way from Cor- pus Christi, occasionally descending from its great height to spray blankets of fog over the highway, causing him to become lost and six hours behind his scheduled arrival at the Houston terminal. The Alvin officers unwillingly admitted that, high in the sky, hovered an object which appeared bright and shiny when the rays of the morning sun struck it. Both truck driver and UFO went on their way later in the morning. * * * TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO - November 1964: Four adults saw and signaled an unidentified light over the Butano Girl Scout Camp, near Pescadero, California, on the second. But when it responded and moved toward them, they panicked and fled. The account was told to sheriff's deputies by Rudolph Huizen, 30, a caretaker at the camp. He said about 8:15 p.m. he heard a dog barking. A friend, Duane Myers, 24, a nursery- man, and he went outside to in- vestigate. In the northeast sky they saw a very bright light about the size of a half-dollar moving erratically. \"It was way up in the sky,\" said Huizen. \"Just for kicks I flashed an SOS at it with my flashlight. And that son-of- a-gun came down!\" There was no sound, he said, just a bright light. \"It came down and set- tled over the trees about half a mile away and moved back and forth. When I flashed my flashlight at it again it lit up the sky like a full moon. It was about as big as a football.\" Huizen and Myers ran into the house, fetched their wives, Henny Huizen, 29, and Diana Myers, 20. The four watched the light for a while, then signalled once more. Then it moved towards them. They fled into the house. \"If you were standing in my shoes, you would have run, too,\" said Huizen. The four peeked out of the doorway, saw the light back away, grow dim. \"Then it took off,\" said Huizen. \"No jet or any plane could go that fast.\" Deputies who went out to the Girl Scout camp reported the observers were all quite sober. *** FIFTEEN YEARS AGO - November 1974: A silver-white, disc- shaped object was sighted on the 24th near Shabbona, Illinois, by a local pilot flying a small private plane from DeKalb to Mendota. On the sunny, slightly hazy day the pilot noticed his magnetic compass turning four to five revolutions a minute — counter- clockwise. Looking out his left window he spotted the 120-foot-long object paralleling his plane at about 80 mph. The pilot said the craft, about 30 feet high, \"tipped up\" revealing that it had no protrusions and no port- 23"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"holes. It shot past the plane after hav- ing paced it for 8 to 10 seconds and was out of sight in about a second. The pilot had been flying for three and a half years and was plant engineer at a Mendota manufactur- ing firm. (This case was investigated by Walt Andrus on 'December 17, 1974. A full report is published in SKYLOOK Number 89, April 1975 page 5.) * ** TEN YEARS AGO - November 1979: Bob Taylor, a 50 year-old forestry foreman said he was assaulted by two beings who tried to pull him into their \"spacecraft.\" It hap- pened early in the morning of the ninth when Taylor was working alone on Dechmont Hill, near the M8 Glasgow-Edinburgh, Scotland, motorway. Taylor said that as he reached a clearing on the hill he was faced with a silver-colored spacecraft. Suddenly, two beings shaped like wheels with arms slowly approached him. They grabbed him by the sides of his trousers and tore them, leaving scratch marks on his thighs. At this point Taylor fainted. But he said he had the sensation of being dragged towards the craft. Taylor also remembered a strong chemical smell and his red Irish setter, normally a placid dog, barking furiously. When he came around he was dazed and shocked and the beings and their craft had gone. In one of the most terrifying UFO encounters ever recorded, a Spanish pilot described how two mysterious glowing objects chased and almost collided with his jet airliner over the Mediterranean Sea on the llth. The case involves a pilot who diverted his plane with 109 passengers and seven crew to make an emergency landing, saying unidentified flying objects were buzzing him and threatening collision. An airport director, among others, said he saw the UFOs. Air Force jets reportedly were sent up and filmed them. And Spain's Transport Minister, ordering an investigation, said, \"It is clear that UFOs exist.\" Francisco 24 Lerdo de Tejada, 34-year-old pilot of the Spanish Caravelle jet said he plunged the aircraft 14,000 feet and put his chartered payload of German and Austrian tourists down in Valen- cia on Spain's Eastern Mediteranean coast rather than .in the Canary Island beauty spot of Tenerife. I've never been in danger like it,\" Lerdo, a pilot of 15 years experience, told reporters. \"What I saw was a UFO.\" Lerdo said two \"intense red lights\" streaked across the sky toward his jet shortly before midnight as he flew at 24,000 feet after taking off from the Mediterranean island of Ma- jorca. After the UFOs made two ap- parent attempts to buzz the airliner, the pilot dropped.his aircraft into a sharp dive and diverted the plane to Valencia. Lerdo said sophisticated radar in Madrid picked up the UFOs and saw them plunge 12,000 feet in 30 seconds — \"something no aircraft can do\" — in an attempt to follow him down. The pilot of a Mirage jet fighter which rushed to the scene also con- firmed seeing two glowing red objects chasing the airliner. Authorities in Cergy-Pontoise, France — a small town northwest of Paris — couldn't decide whether to charge Frank Fontaine and his friends with criminal mischief or to begin a search for a mysterious, glowing UFO. \"This is just too fantastic,\" said Police Chief Roger Courcbus after listening to the testimony of Fontaine, 19, and his two friends, Jean Pierre Prevot and Salomon N'Diaye, both 25. Fon- taine, who had been the object of a police search since the 26th, reap- peared on December third in the ex- act spot where he disappeared on the 26th of November, his friends reported. They said he was wearing the same clothes and had exactly the same amount of money as the day he vanished. Police said the three con- sistently repeated the same story under long questioning. At 4 a.m. on the 26th, the three young men had just finished loading a station wagon with clothes they were going to sell at an open market when they saw a brilliant light about the size of a tennis ball to the right of the car. The ball became larger and larger and came to rest on the hood of the car, causing their eyes to burn. From that moment, until his reap- pearance, Fontaine remembers nothing. Prevot and N'Diaye left Fon- taine to watch the car as they ran home to get a camera. When they returned, their friend was gone. The car was there with the door open and a halo of light surrounded the car. The halo suddenly disappeared. Just as mysteriously as he vanished, Fontaine reappeared at 4:30 a.m., in exactly the same spot. When he saw the car was gone, he thought it had been stolen and rushed to the house of N'Diaye. Seeing his friend in his pa- jamas, he said: \"What are you doing in your pajamas? Five minutes ago you were ready to leave (for the market).\" Police checked the young man and the spot where he disap- peared with a Geiger counter but found no trace of radioactivity. Nor was there any trace of mud-on Fon- taine's clothes or shoes. Chief Courous said Fontaine has not varied his story one bit and his account con- forms exactly with the testimony of his two friends. (Four years later, Jean-Pierre Prevost, one of the participants, ad- mitted that this was a hoax. On July 7, 1983, Mr. Prevost stated in the newspaper Le Parisien \"I confirm that the Cergy-affair was a hoax from the beginning to the end. I am the only one to be held responsible. I organ- ized and put together the whole story. I can prove it...\").

MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 259 November 1989"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The UFO Press BY DENNIS STACY One of the highlights of the sum- mer 1983 BUFORA international UFO congress at High Wycombe, outside London, which I had the op- portunity to attend in person, was the showing of a film taken by amateur photographer Peter Day of Moreton, near Oxford. Exposed at approximately 9:06 GMT on the chilly, overcast morning of January 11, 1973, Day's 23-second 8mm film strip shows an orange ball of light moving from left to right, as memory serves, and never more than a mere five degress above the horizon. In the next to last frame the small blob of light sud- denly winks out. Day said he stopped filming the moment the light disap- peared from view, but only a single frame of the film, the last one, shows a clear sky. Local Kodak experts later consulted during an analysis of the film maintain that such a quick response time is virtually unheard of, if not actually impossible. Day, in his own defense, has always main- tained that he was an \"economical\" cameraman. He was an aircraft buff as well, and frequently filmed flying airplanes over the English coun- tryside, cutting off shooting the mo- ment his targets disappeared from the viewfinder. The result is both a classic UFO case, and an example of how tanta- lizing even the best evidence in such a case can be. Despite the prevalence of undoctored film and the presence of two other groups of substantiating eyewitnesses, final conclusions in the Peter Day UFO case remain remarkably difficult to draw. The ex- emplary account of the subsequent investigation, however, is the subject of Fire in the Sky, volume two in a projected series of in-depth case histories to be published by the British UFO Research Association (BUFORA). The 28-page report can be ordered for $5, air mail postage in- cluded, from BUFORA's director of investigations, Jenny Randies, at 37 Heathbank Rd, Cheadle Heath, Stockport, Cheshire, England, SK3 OUP. When ordering, please send cash only. What makes the Day film even more frustrating and inconclusive is one of those rare coincidences which stir the waters of ufology just enough to render them muddy and occa- sionally undrinkable, at least as far as outsiders are concerned. The coin- cidence in this case was the crash of an American F-lll fighter-bomber some 20 miles distant from where the \"UFO\" was filmed, and by all ac- counts, some 45 minutes later. Still, the proximity of these two rare events in time, if indeed two events were involved, further complicates what is even more rarely straightforward to begin with. How many good UFO films, after all, can you count on the fingers of one hand? Theoretically, our hands shouldn't be so consistently tied . . . but such is the nature of the beast we have adopted for study. Jenny's approach is to let the facts, as they have been determined, and the eyewitness accounts, as they have been collected, speak for themselves. What emerges is a picture of an \"object\" or ball of light approximately four miles away from the photographer, beneath an 1800 feet cloud ceiling and about 65 feet in diameter, traveling roughly 140 miles per hour, all configurations not that far removed from those of a flaming F-lll. Rogue UFO But if we ufologist remain perplexed and confused by the presence of a \"rogue\" F-lll, the military authorities should have been equally perplexed by the presence of a rogue UFO, but this seems not to have been the ease. Day repeatedly offered his film to the military authorities involved, but was rejected every time. One would have thought they would welcome such an opportunity, especially if the UFO MUFON UFO JOURNAL No.259 November 1989 ultimately proved to be their doom- ed fighter. Did they have better film? One can only wonder, for the most part fruitlessly. In fact, as usually happens, the only ones interested at all in this sort of thing turns out to be the largely powerless UFO community. Randies recounts how a group of experts, brought together at Kodak offices, shied away from any further analysis of the Day film once it became ap- parent that the captured image was probably not that of ball lightning. All in all, this is an excellent little chapbook that should be in every serious ufologist's library. Which is not to say that I don't have a few minor carps (and what did you think critics were /or?). For one thing, Jen- ny's eyes and those of the majority of her readers must be a great deal younger than mine. Admittedly, you get as many words as possible jammed into the available space, but the print is still too small for easy reading. Secondly,in the context of an important photographic case, it would have been nice to have had at least one frame of the original film for reference, however crudely reproduced. There are four maps and three illustrations of the filmed object, but a halftone or two here and there (on the cover?) would have been welcome. We appreciate the time that has gone into the publica- tion, and the amount of work involv- ed, especially in terms of the poten- tial market for such a product, so I feel duly guilty about carping in any form or fashion. I would like to add one other com- ment in closing. It strikes me that some American colleagues might be able to add to the presently incomplete pic- ture of the Day film. Perhaps an FOIA researcher here would be willing to write a few inquiries about the cause of the F-lll crash? Also, who was the two-man crew involved, both, of whom survived the crash? Might it not be possible to track them down for a 25"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"personal account of events on that long ago day? Or will the Peter Day film ultimately be allowed to lapse into obscurity like so much else in ufology? Buy this booklet and read what we do know about the Day case, before it, too, fades completely into history. All The News . . . Word broke in some newspapers at least as early as Monday, October 9th, that the Soviet news agency Tass had reported a UFO landing, including scientific confirmation of the event, which involved tall, gangly creatures with tiny knob heads accompanied by a robot. Since this was not the sort of thing Tass normally touts, obviously my curiousity was piqued. Both the local and national TV network news, as is their custom nowadays, treated the af- fair as a joke, mentioning it either as the last item on the broadcast or right before the fade-in to the weather. The majority of the print media dealt with the story the following morning, Tues- day, October 10th in, as might be ex- pected, various fashion. In Fort Worth and Dallas, it made the front pages, as it did in our national paper of record, The New York Times. Local- ly, the Rupert Murdoch-owned San Antonio Express-News relegated it to the middle of its \"Daily Star\" section, a tabloidlike entertainment supple- ment, where the headline blared, \"Tass: Towering UFO Aliens With Tiny Heads Spark Panic.\" The opening sentence noted that \"It was a close en- counter of the Communist kind.\" The Dallas Morning News heralded \"They're Here! Soviet news agency reports UFO, extraterrestrials land in Russian city.\" According to the Knight- Ridder Newspapers dispatch, authored by Steve Goldstein and datelined Moscow, \"Humanoid- looking aliens, with tiny heads on 10- to 13-foot bodies, disembarked from their disc-shaped spaceship and took a stroll around a park in the Russian city of Voronezh recently, the official news agency Tass reported Monday.\" Part of the original Tass (Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union) press release said that \"Scientists have con- firmed that an unidentified flying 26 object recently landed in (the) park ... (and) They have also identified the landing site and found traces of aliens who made a short promenade around the park.\" A good deal of dubiousness was attached by Knight-Ridder to the account as a whole. The Tuesday Times featured the story on the front page as \"Hot News Tass: Tourists From Space,\" followed by a page 7 article Wednesday, \"Fact, Not Fiction, Tass Says of U.F.O.\" (Both references to the so-called National edition.) Supposedly the people who actually witnessed the object and its occupants \"were overwhelmed with a fear which lasted for several days.\" Events reportedly began on the warm September evening of the 27th, about 6:30 p.m., when three children in the park saw \"a pink shining in the sky and then spotted a ball of deep red color\" said to be about ten yards in diameter; At this point a crowd gathered, which \"could clearly see a hatch opening in the lower part of the ball and a humanoid in the opening. \" Then, \"The three-eyed creature, about nine feet tall and fashionably (sic) dressed in silvery overalls and bronze boots and with a disk on its chest, disappeared, then landed and came out for a promenade with a companion and a robot. \"Then aliens seemed to com- municate with each other, producing the mysterious appearance of a shin- ing triangle, and activated the robot with a touch. \"Terrified, a boy began to scream, but with a stare of the alien's shining eyes, Tass said, the boy was silenced and paralyzed.\" On Thursday, October 11, the Times ran its third consecutive story on the reported Soviet sighting, headlined \"Rare Thrill for Tass: Joshing Over U.F.O. Report.\" Needless to say, the powers that print all the news fit to be printed were not taking the episode particularly seriously. MacArthur's Mark That same evening, the Soviet UFO landing took up the second half of CNN's \"Larry King Live\" show. Un- fortunately, host King missed out, having opted for a honeymoon in- stead. He was replaced by Patrick Buchanan, the gruff conservative col- umnist, who, surprisingly, not only seemed fairly at home with the unusual subject matter, but genuinely interested in same. Buchanan's guests were ufologists Don Ecker of California, and one Peter Adams (who he?), if memory serves. The latter's claim to ufological fame seems to have been the fact that he \"was just back from Moscow.\" Given the length of the flight, he should have been able to consume at least one UFO book en route, but any evidence of same was sadly absent. Send him back, I say, but this time with a copy of everything but Majestic. Unfortunately, Ecker, who put on a very nice front overall, and came across as quite accomplished, resorted to two dubious bugbears that continue to plague UFO public relations, one being the MJ-12 papers, the other being the (in) famous speech supposedly delivered by the late Gen- eral Douglas MacArthur in which he warned that the next war would be an \"interplanetary\" one. At least MJ-12 has the \"virtue\" of being under ongoing scrutiny. But someone should be able to label the MacArthur talk, once and for all, as either spurious or legitimate. Allegedly, it was delivered to the 1962 graduating class of West Point, and was reported in \"all the papers of the day, including the New York Times.\" Can't someone track this rumored historical occur- rence down and lay it to rest, or con- firm it for all time? James Moseley is on record as say- ing that regardless of the facts of this particular speech, MacArthur was widely known to be intensely intrigued by the question of extraterrestrial in- telligence. Fine and good. But did MacArthur actually say on record what ufologists from Ecker to Lear et al are constantly saying he said? If so, let's continue trumpeting it to the high heavens. But if not, let's cease and desist embarrassing ourselves with quotes that were never made. Buchanan, for one, who was at least warming to Ecker, turned off completely following the alleged MacArthur warning, saying he had the framed speech hanging on his wall, and there was no such mention of anything remotely resembling the MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 259 November 1989"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"purported remark. At which juncture, the credibility of both Ecker and UFOs could be seen running down the TV wires and into the floor. Buchanan, who had barked at Adams once or twice previously, now snapped at Ecker. It should be a relatively simple mat- ter for some serious researcher to seek out MacArthur's original text, or at least the relevant newspaper accounts of the day. Presumably, this would have been sometime in May of 1962, assuming a West Point graduating date in line with the rest of the coun- try. Let's either recruit the General or let him lie in peace. Communion the Movie Philippe Mora the director and Whitley Strieber the author first met in the late 1960's at the London Film School. Twenty years later, their first collaboration, the movie version of Strieber's Communion, distributed by New Line Cinema, is scheduled to open at 80 or more theaters across the country on November 10th. Rumors have abounded almost as much as anticipation. In Hollywood vernacular, the movie was said to be \"in trouble.\" The special effects were supposed to be less than scintillating, and it was bruited that \"Commu- nion's\" sole saving grace was Christopher Walken's performance in- the lead role. Well, the movie finally premiered in Aspen, Colorado, on October 21st, at the Stage II Theater, and some of the rumors, at least, can finally be laid to rest. The occasion was the Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind Forum at the Givens Institute, hosted by Larry Koss, and attended by perhaps a hundred participants, including seven abductees. Curiously, the premiere was threatened at the eleventh hour (literally in this case, as that was the time the movie was scheduled to roll) with cancellation by Strieber himself, for reasons only he can best defend. \"Communion\" stars Walken as Strieber, Lindsay Grouse as his wife, Anne, and Joel Carson as young An- drew. Frances Sternhagen has a small support role as the psychiatrist to whom Strieber first turns as his strange experiences begin to unfold. Mora (\"The Howling II\"), of course, directs, with screenplay by Strieber, who also serves as associate producer. Mora is also slated to direct Strieber's latest novel, Majestic. It is true that Walken saves the day, in that it is hard to imagine how any other actor on the contemporary scene could have done the role justice. Walken, as anyone familiar with his career knows, always plays Walken. But in this case, his quirky, jerky mannerisms perfectly portray those of a successful New York author (Strieber) on the verge, initially, of a nervous breakdown brought on by writer's block, and later as a justi- fiably confused human being im- mersed in a mind-boggling encounter with apparent alien beings. Needless to say, unfolding events make for a few tense moments in the married relations department. As Anne Strieber, Grouse expresses confusion and concern, not only for her mar- riage and her husband's mental health, but eventually stands by her man and son, even though she understandably has less to do onscreen than Walken. The larter's performance, in fact, is worthy of an Academy Award Best Actor nomination, though that is hardly likely to happen for reasons beyond his control. The Academy historically overlooks \"horror\" films for one thing, and independently pro- duced productions for another. In ad- dition, Walken is an acquired taste. Coupled with a few letdowns here and there in the film, as well as the \"offbeat\" subject matter itself, Walken's chances for peer recognition would seem to be small at best. The situa- tion, in fact, is similar to the one that thwarted Jeff Goldblum's pursuit of the Oscar for his performance in the remake of \"The Fly.\" Joel Carson, as Strieber's young son, Andrew, also shines, and nearly makes off with several scenes neatly tucked under his presumably inexperienced belt. Mora And Mora performs as admirably behind the camera. One hesitates to speculate, but there is the feeling that Mora probably contributed con MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 259 November 1989 siderably to the overall pace of Strieber's script and the tension- breaking bits of humor scattered throughout. He also does an ad- mirable job with the available special effects budget, considering that \"Communion\" can hardly be faulted for not being movie-making on the grand scale of a Hollywood epic. True, certain effects, including the aliens themselves, could have carried more cinematic conviction, but they could also have been a lot less con- vincing as well. A few effects even stand out. A Polaroid snaphot scene, for example, freezes the screen far beyond the real-time flash, giving an eerie sense of suspended illumination. Mora also photographs Walken on several occasions using two cameras with an onscreen feed (or a flat-field wide-angle lens) to zoom in on the ac- tor while the background looms closer, lending a simultaneous sense of physical isolation and of Strieber/Walken being psychically separated from his surroundings. The plot itself, as some readers of the book will no doubt agree, has enough holes to drop a large UFO through, along with enough loose ends to bind up most of the world's abductees. Not only are those gaps not sealed by \"Communion,\" but the movie manages to open up a few yawning chasms of its own. The psychiatrist (Sternhagen), for in- stance, to whom Strieber is re- ferred early on, just happens to know of a group of people with similar experiences who meet regular- ly in the city of New York. Even more coincidentally, she proves to be the head of this selfsame self-support group. Screenwriters, of course, are al- lowed the same license of compres- sion — to a degree — as poets, as long as such contortions don't ob- viously slow or otherwise affect story flow; and for the most part, here, they don't. I leave it to others to comment on how accurate a reflection of reali- ty these group meeting scenes are, but the impression of a few in Aspen who were present at the time, was fairly unfavorable. The cinematic Strieber quickly distances himself from the ab- duction \"scene\" in the movie, when, in fact, I was told, he actually hosted 27"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"several meetings in his own household, and was apparently ge- nuinely relieved and moved to have encountered others with similar shared experiences. In \"Commu- nion,\" Walken-as-Strieber is abruptly dismissive of the meetings as a whole. Cinematic license can be invoked here, too, but obviously there will be those who sharply disagree with the way the situation was handled onscreen. Those looking for a linear, literal reenactment of the original book will be disappointed as well. The little man in the shield in Strieber's bedroom, who presented such a terrifying visage in the book, is here treated as a grotesque, cartoon caricature for no discernible reason. Though those already offended, as well as critics to come, probably : won't agree, what does come through in the movie more than in the book is the immense personal courage it took for Strieber to come forward in person with his story. The sheer embarrassing emo- tionality and intimacy of the abduc- tion scene, with its rough handling and rectal probe, are much more visceral in the visual language of the cinema than on the printed page. Some will be too personally involved or embittered to admit it, but \"Com- munion\" has its more than moving moments. Going to bed early that morning in chill Aspen air and a strange motel room, I found myself momentarily eyeing an open closet door with apprehension and wonder- ing if anything could hide in the folds of the drapes or possibly scrunch itself under the double bed. It also has a moment or two Mora should have reined in. The intended humor of one of the climactic scenes, in which Strieber and abductors con- front one another, is too broad by a gesture, rendered simply laughable when one of the earlier captors culminates an exchange of body language between the two with a \"gimmie-five\" slap of alien to human palms. Gimmie five, and a well deserved break, too. As the experienced hand in this extended family enterprise, Mora should have also drawn in the reins on the final exposition shots. I like the way they were staged (in an art 28 museum), but exposition is notorious- ly awkward as a technique, whether literary or cinematic, and virtually impossible to pull off gracefully, even when as gracefully managed, as it is here. What \"Communion\" cannot be faulted for is its reflection of Strieber's own idiosyncratic (and seemingly in- adequate) interpretation of the abduc- tion experience and the alien entities presumably behind it. On the one hand, given the way the movie con- cludes, it results in the absurd mar- quee: \"Extraterrestrial aliens invade earth! (And cure a bad case of writer's block.)\" On the other hand, it's undeniably Strieber's movie, and it's now in- arguably ours as well. I expect we'll hear more, rather than less, about it in the months to come. Majestic Finally (we have to go to press at some point), this word from the Times again, today, Friday the 13th of October. If you didn't get the telegram on the first reading, try again. Otherwise, you'll be surprised to learn that Whitley Strieber's current novel, Majestic, is also scheduled to be brought to the silver screen by Philippe Mora, the French-born, Australian-raised director who did \"Communion\" the movie, as well as \"The Howling II.\" Apparently, \"Com- munion,\" starring Christopher Walken and Lindsay Grouse, originally scheduled to be released on October 20th by New Line Cinema, has now been moved back to a November 10 release date. Mora and Strieber have been close friends since the two met at the Lon- don Film School in 1968, where, the Times claims, Strieber was a \"Pop ar- tist.\" As with \"Communion,\" Strieber has also written the script for \"Ma- jestic,\" based on a convoluted amalgamation of the Roswell Inci- dent, the alleged MJ-12 documents and the author's own experiences as an abductee. The \"Majestic\" shoot is scheduled to get underway on location in New Mexico in either February or March of next year, and occupy up to twelve weeks. After that, Mora says, he'll take an alien break and work on his next film: \"The Duchess of Windsor.\" MESSAGE, Continued man; Robert H. Bletchman, Director of Public Relations; Antonio Huneeus, Continental Coordinator for South America; William \"Bill\" Knell, Assistant State Director for New York; and Michael Luckman. John Stewart, MUFON Staff video techni- cian, taped the event. Robert Bletchman distributed an outstanding press release prepared by Dennis Stacy titled \"UFOs and Con- gress\" depicting a brief history of the U.S. Congress involvement in UFOs, Project Blue Book and strong reasons why a fresh hearing and investigation should take place. Basically, this was a MUFON press conference. The press conference was well attended by the wire services, TV networks, New York area newspapers and news magazines. Brian O'Leary received a spontaneous applause from the news reporters after delivering his state- ment, a response seldom occurring from the staid press. MUFON is in- debted to Mike Luckman for making the arrangements and publicizing this press conference.

Webb November 1989 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Venus (magnitude -4.4) reaches a point 47° east of the Sun, called greatest eastern elongation, on the 8th. Through small telescopes the nearest planet resembles a tiny half Moon at this time. However, Venus remains rather low in the SW, setting about 2 l /2 hours after sunset. The crescent Moon and Venus are only 0.7° apart on the 2nd, making a nice sight in the sky. And on November 15 the bright planet lies 4° below Saturn. Jupiter (magnitude -2.6), in Gemini not far from the Twin Stars Pollux and Castor, rises in the NE about 7 PM in midmonth. The giant world advances across the SE and southern sky during the night. Saturn (magnitude 0.6), still in Sagittarius, is very low in the SW at dusk and sets in the WSW about 3 hours after the Sun in mid-November. The ringed planet is 4° above the crescent Moon on the 3rd and l /2° below telescopic Neptune on the 12th. The latter event represents the third and final successive conjunction between the pair this year. (Also see Venus.) Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars (magnitude 1.7), moving from Virgo into Libra, should become visi- ble again sometime in late November. It will rise around 5 AM, appear- ing very low in the ESE. Jupiter is well up in the SW at dawn. Meteor Shower: While the South Taurid meteors last all month in declining numbers, their peak of about 10 to 20 per hour is reached on the morning of November 2. Compensating for the Taurids' meager number is the shower's richness in bright fireballs and the relatively slow velocity of its members (about 17 miles per second). Moon Phases: First quarter — November 6 Full moon — November 13 mj Last quarter — November 19 New moon — November 28 The Stars: At 9 PM the brilliant constellations of winter have appeared in the east — Orion, Taurus, Auriga and Gemini. In the north, as the Big Dipper rests along the north horizon, the \"M\" of 5 stars called Cassiopeia the Queen achieves its highest and best viewing position. Crossing the celestial meridian almost directly overhead is a faint blur of light, the bright central hub of the Great Spiral Galaxy of Andromeda. Photographs reveal the exquisite detail of the tilted system's spiral arms of stars and gas clouds wrapped around its glowing center. The An- dromeda Galaxy actually covers an area of sky 4 times the width of the full moon! Although it is the nearest spiral galaxy to our own Milky Way system, the light that enters our eyes today left the Andromeda Galaxy at around the time the human species first appeared on our planet 2 million years ago! This remote galaxy is the most distant object visible with the naked eye. 29"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Director's Message By Walt Andrus Journal Objectives At the Editors' request, numerous readers have personally suggested improvements to the Journal. Ob- viously, their diversified opinions can- not be incorporated into every issue. However, this is your magizine and the ideas of our readers are ap- preciated. Considering the multitude of different interests by our 2200 member/subscribers and wide range of educational background and ex- perience levels, it is difficult to appeal to everyone simultaneously. The single factor that we can all agree upon, that unites all readers, is our common interest in the UFO enigma and the quest to solve the greatest mystery of the space age. Speaking as the International Director and Associate Editor of the MUFON UFO Journal, I will attempt to address the objectives as I perceive them. We are all cognizant that the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) is international in scope, therefore we cannot be geographically orientated toward any specific nation in the published articles or editorial philosophy. The Journal has earned the reputation as the world's leading monthly UFO organization magazine. This recognition challenges the editors and writers to continuous improve- ment and dedication in the future to maintain this enviable position. Since the Journal is a monthly magazine, it can be more current with UFO news, reports, conference an- noucements, publications, book releases, etc. than bi-monthly or quarterly UFO publications. We are limitted only by the logistics of com- posing, publishing and mailing. Specifically, the Journal is our major communication medium with our members as it relates to ufology worldwide. State Directors are en- couraged to publish statewide newsletters to customize local UFO 30 reports, activities and news. The Jour- nal has grown from a regional mimeographed newsletter titled SKYLOOK in 1967, to a typeset and offset printed magazine rivaling others in the scientific field. What Journal Is Not Even though the MUFON UFO Journal represents the Mutual UFO Network, it is not a magazine wherein we talk to each other as \"believers\". While not devoted entirely to UFO sighting reports, it stresses the best cases that have been thoroughly in- vestigated and reported by trained field investigators. The Journal may contain articles exploring all facets of the UFO phenomenon, although it is not a vehicle for the debunkers to vent their negative thoughts and destruc- tive verbiage. It is definitely not a \"New Age\" publication dealing with crystals, pyramids, channeling, etc. We do not accept paid advertising. Such ads for trinkets, gadgets, publications, etc. have no place in a scientific scholarly publication. The Journal is not a newsstand magazine, nor will it ever be. Editorial Veracity Since the MUFON UFO Journal is the voice of the Mutual UFO Net- work, the Editor and Associate screen all articles for content and ap- propriateness. Submitted articles and illustrations have been rejected on oc- casion when they were not in good taste or acceptable for a \"family caliber\" magazine. When we are deal- ing with what many people consider a controversial subject, some articles may seem offensive to certain readers because the article contents do not necessarily agree with their own per- sonal philosophy or hypothesis. If we are to solve the UFO phenomenon in our lifetime, however, we must main- tain an open mind as true scientists to various theories and hypotheses. Members and even non-members seem to feel that if they submit an ar- ticle or a \"letter to the editor\" that the Journal is obligated to publish it regardless of content or quality. One self-styled ufologist even demanded that the editor \"guarantee in concrete\" that his controversial article would be published before it was ever written. Obviously this is absurd. The caliber of published articles will be entirely dependent upon the degree of excellence, quality and im- portance of submitted material. The status level must be gradually raised if our monthly magazine is to main- tain its leadership position. The members/subscribers should have confidence in their editors' judgement to publish the most appropriate material available from submissions. The more professional the article, the greater choice that the editors will have to upgrade the Journal. Comments There are numerous professional- caliber organizational magazines be- ing published worldwide, which MUFON highly recommends, pro- vided the reader is fluent in the publication's language. International UFO Reporter, Flying Saucer Review and the new BUFORA publication, UFO TIMES are recommended English language magazines. UFO and UFO Universe are available newsstand magazines in the U.S.A. Dennis Stacy, the editor of the MUFON UFO Journal, has not only achieved the professional stature in ufology of editors such as Gordon Creighton, Charles Bowen, Richard H. Hall and Jerome Clark, but has the potential to surpass each of them with the readers' support. Mr. Stacy can be Continued on page 29 MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 259 November 1989"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"DEAR EDITORS, I HAVE READ MANY ITEMS ABOUT UFOs IN THE PRESS. DO THEY REALLY EXIST? IF SO, ARE THEY A DIRECT THREAT TO PEACE ON EARTH? WHAT HAS SCIENCE TO SAY ABOUT THIS SCORE? Benjamin S. Mapurisa, Zimbabwe Since 1947, when American citizen Kenneth Arnold saw from his plane strange glimmering objects in the mountains, the world has been talk- ing about Unidentified Flying Ob- jects (UFOs). The appearance of UFOs is from time to time reported in newspapers and magazines, radio and television. They are all analysed by scientists. On August 25, 1966, a USAF of- ficer working on Minuteman missile in North Dakota saw that his radio had stopped functioning. He was 18 metres down in the concrete silo. The ground crew reported that they saw a UFO which had alternately descended and climbed. The radar detected it at a height of 30 kilo- metres, after which the UFO climbed and interference disappeared. And then it started to land. When a group of soldiers dispatched to the landing site was 16 kilometres from the silo, interference broke its radio contact with command. It was suggested that during the 1966-1967 period of the UFO activity, the UFOs visited also the Titan silos. Experts were concerned over the electromagnetic effects, that might be capable of in- fluencing the electric equipment of combat missiles. In the autumn of 1974, a metal disk some 100 metres across approached a South Korean anti-aircraft shore battery. The commander launched a Hawk guided missle which was im- mediately shot down by a \"white ray\" from the UFO. The second ray was directed at the battery, melting the remaining two Hawk missies into an unrecognisable mass. The investigation of the UFO prob- lem was launched in the US by the military. In 1947, on orders from the Air Force commander, they started Project Sign. The Air Technical In- telligence Centre was responsible for research. Back in February 1953, head of the anti-aircraft committee of the continent General Benjamin Chidlow stated: \"We have a great mass of reports about flying saucers. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 259 November 1989 We regard this very seriously because we have lost many people and many aircraft which have at- tempted to attack UFOs.\" Project Sign was subsequently renamed Grudge and then Fang. But it is better known under the name Project Blue Book. In 1954 the French Ministry of the Armed Forces established a depart- ment to collect information about UFOs. In 1977 the French National Space Research Centre created a group of experts to study uniden- tified aerospace phenomenon, GEPAN. In 1960-1970, public organizations studying UFOs mushroomed throughout the world, notably in Bulgaria, Denmark, West Germany and Mexico. Later UFO fever spread to Canada, Britain, Japan, China and other countries. In the autumn of 1978, the First Committee of the 33rd UN General Assembly discussed the question of launching international UFO research. The discussion was based on ICUFON Memorandum, a public US organization studying UFOs. It provided a wealth of information on the military-technical and military- political aspect of the problem. After- wards, though, information on UFO research in the West dwindled. The press published only distorted and superficial information about UFOs. At that time, the US launched the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). The study of UFOs in the Soviet Union started in 1958 by a group of enthusiasts led by Feliks Zigel, assistant professor at the Moscow Aviation Institute and the founder of UFOIogy in the Soviet Union. In the mid-1970s, information about UFOs was collected by the Institute of Earth Magnetism, Ionosphere and Radio Waves, led by Vladimir Migulin, corresponding member of the USSR Academy of Sciences. In 1984, a commission to study anomalous phenomena, led by Vsevolod Troitsky, corresponding member of the USSR Academy of Sciences, was established at the national scientific and technological society of nature protection. In April last year, Tomsk hosted a conference 31"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"on sporadic instant phenomena, which rallied more than 300 scien- tists and experts from major scien- tific centres of the Soviet Union. The conference recommended that the Siberian branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences draft a com- prehensive programme for the study of the problem. Many Soviet and foreign scientists tried to present the UFO phenom- enon as a natural thing, such as op- tical atmospheric effects, flocks of birds, rare astronomical phenomena, meteorites, luminous insects, frauds, weather balloons, aircraft, missile launches, streams of space particles, clusters of light, ball lightning, luminous polutants, Polar lights, etc. According to the USSR Academy of Sciences, some 90-95% of UFO reports are a result of such causes or a combination of them. But the re- maining share constitutes tens of thousands of unexplained phe- nomena. The main \"positive\" version has been the idea of extra-terrestrials. Despite its great popularity, it has not been unequivocally supported by scientists. The most promising today is the idea of the plasma origin of the UFO phenomenon. In 1984, scien- tists Aleksei Dmitriyev and Viktor Zhuravlyov from Novosibirsk ad- vanced a theory of the plasma origin of the Tungus phenomenon. As is known, the culmination of that uni- que event in Siberia in 1908 was a 40-megaton air explosion. There are reasons to believe that the Tungus phenomenon and UFOs have a com- mon origin. We believe that so far the study of UFOs has not paid due heed to some specific features, as well as the mech- anism of human perception of the world around us. Frequency param- eters of UFOs and the limited speed of processing information in the eye- brain system breed so-called meta- phoric deformities. Eye-witnesses see not the object itself but their own in- dividual or accepted idea of it. Proof of this is the historical mimicry of UFOs outlook and special photographing. Research by foreign and Soviet experts show that there are, in the atmosphere and at 32 Photo of a UFO taken by a Soviet amateur photographer the Earth's surface, certain plasma formations, different in form, size, colour and frequency. Most often, they are registered in the ultraviolet part of the spectre. These unseen formations, which, however, can be felt, often appear to act systematical- ly and even \"reasonably.\" Successful study of UFOs is im- possible without a considerable ex- pansion of our views of the world. The idea of a multi-dimensional and multi-layered Universe, of parallel or intertwined physical worlds were voiced by major scientists, notably Paul Ehrenfest, Konstantin Tsiolkov- ski, Aleksandr Friedman, Anatoly Logunov and Dmitry Blokhintsev. Materializing the principles of the new political thinking, the Soviet Union is actively working for univer- sal security and disarmament. Against this background, the world public cannot but be worried by the US carrying on with the SDI pro- gramme. This ballistic missile defense is designed to control outer space and destroy near-earth, air and space targets. Any system can be ef- fective only if it is managed by super- quick computer systems. It is most important here to correctly identify targets. So, corresponding computer cells must \"know\" what signal characteristics of the object it is tracking can make it potential target. We believe that lack of information on the characteristics and influence of UFOs increase the threat of incor- rect identification. Then, mass tran- sition of UFOs along trajectories close to those of combat missiles could be regarded by computers as an attack. In the autumn of 1960, all bombers at the Travis Air Force Base in the United States were put on red alert for an attack against the Soviet Union after the base radars detected \"targets\" flying via the North Pole to the US territory. Suddenly the \"targets\" disappeared from the screen, and were later explained as \"radar reflections of the Moon.\" In SDI conditions such incidents could provoke immediate reactions from computers to destroy the \"tar- gets,\" say, by an X-ray laser, which means a powerful nuclear explosion. Or SDI computers could order a counter-attack, which might prove un- warranted. It should be remembered that decisions will be taken not by people but by impartial computers which \"know nothing of UFOs.\" There would be no time to determine the cause of the conflict then, but those who are creating SDI should think about it now. The UFO problem remains un- solved. It is difficult to predict what would have happened if an incident similar to the Tungus one happened in Europe, America or any other region of local conflicts. Back in 1968, Feliks Zigel, the main Soviet researcher of the problem, said: 'The subject and aims of UFO research are sufficiently important to justify any effort. Understandably, international cooper- ation is vitally needed here.\" Aleksandr KUZOVKIN, Aleksandr SEMYONOV MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 259 November 1989"}]
