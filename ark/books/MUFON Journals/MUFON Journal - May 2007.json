WHEREAS, the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) is the United Nations office principally responsible for promoting international coopera- tion in the peaceful uses of outer space; and WHEREAS, Planet Earth is much like an island in a great and fathomless ocean, separated from other planets and celestial bodies by thousands, millions, billions, and in some instances trillions of miles; and WHEREAS, astronauts, cosmonauts, and numerous other brave souls who have ventured into outer space during the last 47 years have marveled at how special, unique, and wonderful our Planet Earth is from space, including NASA astronaut Roger Chaffee who remarked, “The world itself looks cleaner and so much more beautiful. Maybe we can make it that way – the way God intended it to be – by giving everyone, eventually, that new perspective from out in space”; and WHEREAS, on September 21, 1987, before the United Nations General Assembly, President Ronald Reagan remarked, “In our obsession with antagonisms of the moment we often forget how much unites all the members of humanity”; and WHEREAS, when one considers the vastness of space and the relatively small size of our Planet in comparison to the scale of the Universe, even our most massive conflicts and violent political disputes among nations seem minor; and WHEREAS, we as a human race have much to learn, not only from one another, but from exploration of the planets, stars, and solar systems beyond our own; and WHEREAS, statistically speaking, there are four hundred billion stars just in our galaxy alone, and if only one in a million of those had planets, and if just one of a million of those had life, and if just one out of a million of those had intelligent life, there would be literally millions of civilizations out there, making our conflicts with our fellow man seem irrelevant and petty in the grand scheme of things; and WHEREAS, the expansion of knowledge and the humility from discovering new worlds and unlocking secrets of the stars could greatly impact the progress of Continued on page 4 The Hawaii House of Representa- tives recently drafted a resolution addressed to the United Nations, to promote a “search for intelligent life and a definitive answer to whether or not it has come to Earth or is in our reach.” The committee heard the resolution on March 21, 2007 but unfortunately due to some dissenting committee members, the resolution was deferred for a period of two years. MUFON was asked by Daniel de Gracia, Community Liaison for Repre- sentative Rida T.R. Cabanilla—Chair for the Hawaii House of Representa- tives Committee on International Affairs— to submit testimony regard- ing the resolution. De Gracia stated that “since MUFON’s mission is to study UFOs, I was hoping that possi- bly you could offer comments regard- ing this matter in support, and possibly inform the Committee about some of your findings.” MUFON’s Testimony The Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), Inc. has been investigating and studying the mystery of Unidenti- fied Flying Objects (UFOs) for 38 years, taking over where the U.S. Air Force left off when it terminated Project Blue Book in 1969. The hypothesis that these strange objects represent a visiting non-human intelli- gence is called the Extraterrestrial Hypothesis or ETH. Unfortunately, ETH has not been explored by the scientific community because it is not subject to the tenet of hypothesis falsifiability, which states that a hypothesis that cannot be disproved is not considered a viable hypothesis. A hypothesis that can be explored is the Human Manufacture hypothesis or HM. The HM hypothesis states that those objects of apparent technological manufacture that cannot be prosaically explained are being manufac- tured by one or more world governments or by covert elements thereof. These power groups are testing these objects in public airspace, which is not publicly disclosed because they are being kept in strategic reserve for national security reasons. These power groups conve- niently use the popular media and cultural view that Rep.

That the U.S. Government has been implicated in this practice is a matter of national record. In late 1993, inquiries from several UFO researchers led then CIA Director R. James Woolsey to order a review of all CIA files on UFOs. Taking advantage of this opportunity, National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) and government historian Gerald K. Haines reviewed the documents, conducted interviews, and wrote a study examining the CIA’s interest and involvement in UFO investigations from 1947 until 1990. Haines’s study was published in Studies in Intelligence , a classified journal published quarterly for the U.S. intelligence community. The article, “CIA’s Role in the Study of UFOs, 1947-1990,” (https://www.cia.gov/csi/ studies/97unclass/ufo.html) appeared in the first semiannual unclassified edition for 1997, and is a rather important document because it is the first time that a U.S. Government agency has written a review of its involvement with UFOs. Haines claims that many UFO sightings in the late 1950s and 1960s were actually misidentified secret American spy planes. Moreover, he alleges that the U.S. Air Force’s Project Blue Book purposely misled the public by concocting UFO expla- nations for what it knew to be secret military missions. Note that the CIA is not accused of deception by Haines; rather, it is the U.S. Air Force that willingly made up the bogus explana- tions. After Haines article was re- leased, media reporters asked the U.S. Air Force for comment, and on August 4, 1993, Brigadier General Ronald Sconyers told the press, “I cannot confirm or deny that we lied. The U.S. Air Force is committed to providing accurate and timely information within the confines of national security.” Haines also points out that the 1953 classified U.S. Government sponsored Robertson Panel study of UFOs and the panel’s recommenda- tions that UFO reports be routinely debunked and that UFO groups be watched for subversive activities was evidence that the spy plane deception was just a small part of an overall strategy to mislead the public. The Robertson Panel report was later declassified (available for online viewing at http://www.blackvault.com/ documents/ufos/cia/robertson0.htm ) and it concluded that: “The Panel’s concept of a broad educational program integrating efforts of all concerned agencies was that it should have two major aims: training and debunking. The training aim would result in proper recognition of unusually illuminated objects (e.g., balloons, aircraft reflections) as well as natural Hawaii House Resolution calls for United Nations to Search for Intelligent Extraterrestrial Life Continued on page 5 Continued from page 3"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"      5 MUFON UFO Journal May 2007 phenomena (meteors, fireballs, mi- rages, noctilucent clouds). The debunking aim would result in reduction in public interest in flying saucers which today evokes a strong psychological reaction. This education could be accomplished by mass media such as television, motion pictures, and popular articles. Basis of such educa- tion would be actual case histories which had been puzzling at first but later explained. As in the case of conjuring tricks, there is much less stimulation if the secret is known. Such a program should tend to reduce the current gullibility of the public and consequently their susceptibility to clever hostile propaganda.” HM however cannot explain all of the UFO cases that MUFON has investigated, many of which fall in a category deemed “highly strange.” These are cases where the observed objects temporarily immobilize witness vehicles and even the witnesses themselves (temporary paralysis), or emit rays of light that abruptly end in the atmosphere, or bend light rays around objects. In the same highly strange category, non-human occu- pants emerge from these objects and sometimes interact with witnesses (sometimes using telepathic communi- cation). The objects observed in these close encounters are of a physical nature as evidenced by the physical traces left in the environment (burned vegetation, imprints in the soil, etc.). These highly strange cases could be evidence of ETH or could be related to another hypothesis not yet formu- lated. The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute has been actively searching for signs of other civilizations in the Universe. It should be stressed that MUFON and the SETI Institute do agree that there is non-human intelligent life in our universe—where we differ is whether representatives of those other civiliza- tions have visited planet earth. SETI rejects this possibility outright whereas MUFON is open to the possibility. The SETI Institute believes that the vast distances between stars in the Uni- verse is too great for other civilizations to travel. This is a failure of imagina- Hawaii House Drafts Resolution to UN Continued from page 4 tion. If we consider that humanity’s technological progress spans a short 200 years, and then entertain that a non-human technological civilization may have started their technological journey thousands, if not millions of years before us, the means of travel, harnessing of energy, etc employed by these other civilizations would be beyond our comprehension. It is a travesty that the scientific community has not adequately ad- dressed the UFO phenomenon, but instead has relegated it to the status of Pseudoscience. In this vacuum of intellectual curiosity, MUFON has operated for the last 38 years, assisted by a small group of interested academ- ics who form an “invisible college.”. MUFON implores the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs to take action and promote the widespread scientific study of these mysterious objects. James Carrion, MUFON Interna- tional Director The SETI Institute was also asked to submit testimony to the committee. Date of sighting: 8/1/2006 7:45 PM Reported: 8/1/2006 Location: Bethpage, New York Duration: 2 minutes Source of report: MUFON CMS Database Investigated by: Brian Gaugler, MUFON Field Investigator for Long Island, New York State Witnesses: Robert (last name with- held), the main witness and the submit- ter of the initial report, is 34 years old and at the time of the sighting was on disability leave from work due to several broken bones suffered during a motor- cycle accident. Upon speaking to him over the phone and in person, I found him to be a person of solid character, who is intelligent, cheerful, good- natured, down to earth, and a family man. He replied to my emails as soon as possible, and did not hesitate to answer any and all questions about the case that I posed to him over the phone and/or through email and in person. I also was able to speak to his mother Gina, who struck me as being someone who is busy with family and other practical matters, and so has little time for more “fantastic” things such as UFOs. Robert’s two daughters, aged four and six, were also present at the time of the sighting, and were even the ones to draw attention to the strange objects, but their father has requested anonym- ity for them, and so they will not be discussed further in this report except in the retelling of the UFO encounter. Both Robert and Gina came across as honest, sincere people who were genuinely puzzled by what they had witnessed, and who initially assisted me in my investigation to the best of their ability. Robert, in particular, has been greatly affected by his sighting, becom- ing deeply interested in UFOs and other anomalous phenomena, although there is no reason to believe that his subse- quent research into the subject has From the Field: MUFON Investigative Report—Bethpage, NY Continued on page 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"May 2007 6 MUFON UFO Journal contaminated the original report in any way. Prior to the sighting, Robert was the only witness to have been mildly interested in the subject, having read Whitley Streiber’s Communion and a few other books on UFOs and con- spiracy theories, but did not have an in depth knowledge on the subject. His level of interest is about average for a member of our society, but seems too superficial to be able to make up some of the finer details surrounding his experience, as will be detailed further on in the report. In speaking to him about his sighting, I do not feel that he embellished the details in any way to in order to make it more sensational, and I do not feel that he, or the other wit- nesses, are of the character to fabricate a hoax, though of course the possibility always exists. The craft: The UFOs were described as being oval-shaped from left to right, described by the witness as being similar in appearance to a “lopsided egg.” The two objects were estimated to be between 12 and 15 feet in diameter, with no windows or doors, and ap- peared to be silver colored on the top of the craft and a charcoal-grayish color on the bottom. No lights were seen at any time on either of the two craft, and they could safely be compared to other UFOs reported around the world in what Hynek termed Close Encounters of the First Kind (CE-I). No sounds or smells of any kind were associated with the UFOs, and no electro-magnetic effects were reported, with the possible exception of a defective cell phone light, which will be discussed further on in the report. Sequence of events: On the evening of August l, 2006, Robert was in his backyard along with his mother Gina and his two daughters, enjoying the nice weather and just generally relaxing after having eaten dinner. While Robert floated on his back in his pool, his daughter suddenly shouted “Daddy, look at that,” pointing up at something passing close overhead in the sky. He looked up to where she was pointing, and saw a strange object passing over his house from the west and traveling to the east, which was later estimated to be traveling at least 50 mph. The UFO, as described above, flew over the house and passed over their heads at a height of what was later estimated to be one thousand feet in the air, traveling in a straight line as it passed silently over- head. After about two minutes, a second object appeared in the sky and followed the path that the first craft had taken, appearing identical in every way to the first UFO but instead spinning end over end so that the top and bottom of the object constantly alternated and switched position in a fluttering motion. At this point, Robert got out of his pool and stood on a picnic table to get a closer look at the two UFOs, watching as the second object gradually caught up to the first object until they both suddenly vanished, as if they were a light that someone had suddenly turned off. During the event, a small plane had flown into the area and came close to the objects before suddenly diverting his course, so it is entirely possible that there is an additional witness to the event that has yet to be tracked down. In addition, there is a possible electro-magnetic effect concerning Robert’s cell phone, which had lain open during the sighting and had one of its lights inexplicitly short out, although the question remains as to why the entire cell phone itself wasn’t affected, and so the link to the UFO sighting remains slim at best. Other Related Events: After his UFO sighting, Robert spoke with his neighbor who lives in the house behind him, a young woman in her mid-20s who told him that, the night before his sighting, she actually witnessed a UFO fly over her house. She told him that it had been a black triangular object that had passed over her house on the night of July 31, which was the night before Robert’s sighting, but her manner in talking about the sighting revealed a skeptical point of view about UFOs. Thus, I unfortu- nately wasn’t able to reach her to ask her further about the experience, and so only have a little bit of information to put down in this report. Robert told me about a sighting that his father-in-law had experienced in Brooklyn in 1945, when he was just 15 years old. His father-in-law and his sister (Robert’s aunt-in-law) had been sitting on a stoop in Brooklyn when a disc-shaped object descended from the sky and hovered over them momen- tarily before ascending back into the sky and disappearing from view. Robert stated that his father in-law was a straight-laced, no-nonsense person who was not prone to making things up, and who in fact was extremely hesitant to speak about the event, only doing so after being relaxed with some alcohol. I tried to get Robert to speak to his father in-law about the possibility of an interview, but Robert failed to follow through, so I decided to cease my efforts and present the information already gathered. Another interesting aspect of the case is that all of the witnesses involved spoke of hearing and witnessing jet fighters taking off near their house, so close that Robert spoke of seeing landing gear fold up into the belly of one jet. He told me that other people around the neighborhood had also witnessed the take off of the jet fight- ers, and that the loud booming sounds from the engines had actually shaken his house. He said he had never wit- nessed any of the jets return back to their take-off point, and could only surmise that they had landed some- where else. Robert’s house is located behind the remnants of the Grumman Aero- space Corporation, which used to be one of the leading producers of civilian and military aircraft in the 20th century until its merger with the Northrop Corporation in 1994 to form Northrop Grumman.

Sources differ on whether these cases span 30 years or 50+ years. The agency went public because people were concerned about secrecy and conspiracies, says Jacques Arnauld of GEIPAN, the CNES unit set up to investigate UFOs in 1977, according to New Scientist magazine. Known as OVNIs in French, UFOs have always generated intense interest along with countless conspiracy theories about secretive government cover-ups. Other reports say that the aim was to make it easier for scientists and other UFO buffs to access the data for research. So far, the GEIPAN website ( www .cnes-geipan.fr) contains just a quarter of the more than 6,000 eye- witness UFO reports sent to the unit by police over 30 years, according to New Scientist magazine. Typically, such reports are followed up by police and scientific and military experts. GEIPAN has debunked about 75 percent of them, according to New Scientist . Although some early reports claimed France was releasing “secret UFO files,” in fact, no military files have been released, according to astronomer and UFO researcher Jacques Vallee, “France does have secret UFO files and they are NOT available. In fact nobody knows where they are— same as in the US. “The files that are made available now by GEIPAN are the CNES files, mostly consisting of reports from Gendarmes, which will be very useful to researchers, but they were never classified. You needed special authorization to see them, and it was rarely given. Only a few cases have been evaluated as significant, and those have already been published in some detail: Trans-en-Provence, L’Amaranthe, and a few others that will be described again in the forthcoming book by GEIPAN.” The online archives, which will be updated as new cases are reported, include detailed cases ranging from the easily dismissed to the very perplexing. The released files include pictures of possible UFOs, eyewitness accounts, field journals, scanned police reports and inter-governmental documents on those sightings. These French CNES Releases 1,600 UFO Files CHILE—Santiago de Chile - The Chilean Army revealed to the UFO com- munity, in early February 2007, classi- fied material of recordings and encoun- ters between the military and UFOs over the past 30 years, according to the El Mercurio newspaper. The evidence was presented at the 10th International UFO Congress, highlighting a video that shows surface vessels and helicopters of the Chilean Navy pursuing an UFO seven years ago, according to Rodrigo Fuenzalida, director of the Agrupacio de Investigaciones Ovnilogicas (AION). Another UFO chase took place on March 27, 2000, when about 100 French documents are not filled with black censors’ marks, according to online source Associated Content. “We do not have the least proof that extra-terrestrials are behind the unexplained phenomena,” said Jacques Patenet, the aeronautical engineer who heads the CNES office for the study of “non-identified aerospatial phenomena.” But then he added, “Nor do we have the least proof that they aren’t.” Those who read French can go to www .cnes-geipan.fr.

For many it is now acceptable to think of craft from other worlds flying in the sky, but for them the concept that they might land and attempt contact belongs strictly to Hollywood. This article is NOT about “contactee” or “channeling” claims per se. Nor do I deal with the “abduc- tion” phenomenon that sometimes seems to have also abducted Ufology in recent years. Instead, here I discuss the next level of contact by examining the evidence that some extra-terres- trials may actually live among us in our communities, undetected as being anything other than our fellow humans. Those contactees I am aware of who have claimed that this happens are referenced. I will then examine what I consider is much more credible evidence that ET is already here. The following evidence convinces me that some extraterrestrial groups have maintained a covert presence on earth for a very long time, perhaps for as long as we have been here. Furthermore, it suggests to me that this presence—like UFO activity itself—has increased over the last century and seems to be following a gradually unfolding program of conditioning and disclosure. These accounts remind us that—like it or not—claims of alien contact is an integral aspect of ufology that must be considered. What gives weight to this eyewitness testimony is its consistency . When a great range of people from many places tell essentially the same thing over a long period of time, it is more likely to be true. This article will be presented in three parts. This month’s segment is about well-known contact cases that are possibly fabrications. Next month I’ll discuss cases which seem more credible. The “contactees” reconsidered First, I will discuss briefly the best-known of all claims that some extraterrestrials live and work among us on earth. To mention the names of George Adamski, Howard Menger, Albert Coe, Frank Stranges and Daniel Fry is to commit the equivalent of professional suicide in some circles. Like most researchers I have studied what may be termed the “classic” contactee cases at great length over many years. Like many researchers, I have usually dismissed them out of hand as delusional and fraudulent. However, perhaps these claims have sometimes been dismissed too quickly; there may be lessons to learn from them. Albert Coe (1904- ) claims the earliest experience, although his book was not published until 1969. 1,2 Coe was sixteen and on a canoeing trip in 1920 with a friend in the remote Ontario wilderness when he helped rescue a young man who had slipped into a crevasse. Coe had to assist him back to his “aircraft” parked downstream. Coe helped the injured young man into the disc-shaped craft before it floated away. This initiated a series of regular meetings that Coe claimed lasted for more than five decades. As trust developed, Coe claimed he was told that his friend posed as an engineering student who enjoyed fishing and that from 1904 onwards his group had a hundred “observers” living among us in small teams, monitoring our atomic research. Howard Menger (b.1922) claimed to have had a series of contacts from 1932 onwards with several space people living among us, eventually becoming well known for his claims. His unearthly friends were able to pass themselves off as earth people in a variety of situations including real-estate agents and GIs. Menger helped them with haircuts, earth clothing and food supplies. Later he claimed to have flown with them. 3 George Adamski (1891-1965) was the first person to make public claims of contact and remains the best known of all the contactees. From his first meeting with aliens in 1952, Adamski claimed to have frequent meetings with space people who could pass themselves off as businessmen, spoke vernacular English, drove cars and claimed to live among us. His rendezvous with them often took place in hotel lobbies and at least one apparent encounter took place at a theatre in Switzerland with a witness present. Although his claims became so extreme that most of his followers deserted him, Adamski’s original story and photographs established a kind of paradigm in contactee circles and in the broader world of ufology. 4 From 1954 onwards, Daniel Fry (1908-1992) claimed to have flown in Are Extraterrestrials Already Among Us?

He maintained telepathic contact for some years with an entity he called “Alan,” assisting him for five years to prepare to live undetected on earth. 5 Frank Stranges , (b.1927) a California minister of religion, claimed that the U.S government had a num- ber of Venusians as its guests in the 1950s, the leader being “Valiant Thor.” The group was here to help us avoid a bleak future. Photographs of some of the group, dressed in western clothing, were published in Strange’s 1967 book. 6 Stranges remains active in the field today.

The man later visited him at his home, imparting voluminous and often—from a 2007 perspective—absurd claims about physics, our solar system and space travel. Perhaps it was not all in vain, for Felix claimed to have embraced religion as a result of his encounter. However, he also developed a cult following and was eventually con- victed of political terrorism, ending behind bars in an asylum in 1971. 7 In the case of Menger, Adamski and Fry, the original claims were not totally unbelievable and offered witnesses and photographic evidence to back them up. Menger and Fry produced some impressive photo- graphs and movie film that lend some credence to their claims. Some of the eyewitness testimony in particular is hard to dismiss. Multiple witnesses said they watched Adamski’s first en- counter in the desert with “Orthon,” 8 while others said they saw Menger’s other-worldly friends performing amazing feats. 9 The same can be said of Eduard “Billy” Meier (b. 1937), whose claims I essentially reject. A former Cambodian diplomat recently affirmed that she saw Meier with an apparent extraterrestrial woman and witnessed regular UFO appearances while he lived in India prior to becoming well known. 10 Other witnesses swear that they have seen his Pleiadian ships near his Swiss base. Meier however, so far as I am aware, has never claimed that any extraterrestrials live among us, so is only mentioned here because the trajectory of his story matches the others so well. In all but the Coe case, something changed and eventually the claims made by each person reached such a level of absurdity and farce that the entire case was discredited. Fry produced one of the most obviously faked films of a hovering flying saucer. Menger flew to the moon and walked unprotected on its surface along with “hundreds” of other earth tourists. Adamski enjoyed a morning walk on a brisk sunny day on Venus. Stranges visited Valiant Thor’s home inside Venus. Not to be outdone, Billy Meier flew to another universe altogether, where he photographed blurry dinosaurs and primitive beings and later, a poorly constructed small model “starship” sitting outside his compound. We see a similar pattern with a more recent contactee, Enrique Castillo Rincon . Castillo was befriended by a young man outside a movie theatre in 1969 in Caracas, Venezuala, where he was working. They became friends and socialized a lot in various settings. Eventually his friend, who claimed to be Swiss, was transferred. Years later, Castillo was led to make physical contact with a large craft and found that his former friend was a member of the crew. He then claimed a series of trips in saucers piloted by Pleiadians and by beings from Mercury and Jupiter, a visit to a secret base high in the Andes where other people were being taught and a trip to an underwater alien base. But in the process, a fairly straight- forward, perhaps-believable account spirals downwards into a quasi- religious, mystical morass of vague prophecies and Christ-like figures emerging from caves making ludicrous statements. 11 Aside from deliberate fraud, insanity or CIA manipulations, a possible reason for this pattern among contactees has been suggested: deliberate disinformation from the extra-terrestrials. Dr. James Dear- dorff has theorized that introducing absurd claims may merely be an extraterrestrial strategy to control the pace of release. 12 For example, at least one person has claimed that Adamski’s original experiences had been authentic, but that he divulged something confiden- tial, obliging the extraterrestrials to discredit him. 13 Perhaps this is so. And we should be mindful that charlatans are found, still, in ufology today. The UFO research community has to consider the possibility that perhaps some of these contacts may have been genuine, but that when the contacts ended, human pride and ego had the need to keep it going, to embroider and expand? Is it conceivable that the experiences sparking these cases were so transforming that the recipient was unable to return to “normal” life and had to perpetuate it by any means possible, even faked evidence? Are we learning more about ourselves, our psyche and perhaps our innate cosmic loneliness than we are learning about extraterrestrials in these instances? Next month: Credible Cases Explored.

When an individual calls MUFON to report an alien abduction experience, the call is automatically routed to Lester Velez, who is not only MUFON’s Northern California Assistant State Director but is also the OPUS Vice President. The stated mission of OPUS, a 501(C)3 nonprofit organization, is: To develop a network of people dedicated to a better understanding of the overall nature of unusual/anomalous personal experiences and to support those who have them. Such experiences may include extraordinary states of consciousness, fortean, spiritual, or parapsychological phenomenon, close encounters with non-human entities, and/or UFO activity. Through its educational services and position of neutrality, OPUS provides a meeting ground for people and groups of opposing and often controversial views, in the hope that in working together we can further our overall knowledge in these areas and promote scientific research with the ultimate goal of helping humankind. To that end, OPUS networks with many like-minded organizations such as John Mack Institute (JEMI), Budd Hopkins and the Intruders Foundation, Dr. Leo Sprinkle and ACCET, (Academy of Clinical Close Encounters Therapists, Inc.), Yvonne Smith and CERO, (Close Encounter Research Organization), and Dr. David Jacobs and I.C.A.R., (International Center for Abduction Research).

For the first time, the City of Roswell, New Mexico, and several national sponsors are backing the event. This year’s 60 th Anniver- sary UFO Festival celebration is not to be missed! The Roswell Incident went dormant a few days after it occurred and stayed that way for 31 years until Stanton Friedman, a nuclear physicist and the original civilian researcher, interviewed the 1947 Roswell Army Air Field Intelligence Officer, Major Jesse Marcel. The story is so intrigu- ing that hundreds of books and docu- mentaries have been produced about the Roswell Incident, and Roswell has become a UFO center. Walter Haut (the Roswell AAF Base PR officer) and Glenn Dennis joined local businessman Max Littell to found the International UFO Museum & Research Center in 1991, which now draws over 150,000 visitors annually. In 1997, for the 50 th anniversary celebration of the Roswell Incident, the population of Roswell almost doubled with Festival attendees plus media from around the globe. Organiz- ers promise the 60 th Anniversary will be even bigger and better. Speakers coming for their first Roswell appearance include five researchers from Mexico, who will give bilingual lectures. The over 30 speakers include: Dennis Balthasar, Greg Bishop, Donald Burleson PhD, Stephen Bassett, Richard Dolan, Adam GoRightly, John Greenewald, Michael Heiser PhD, Tom Horn, Guy Malone, Nick Redfern, John Rhodes, Peter Robbins, Rob Simone and more. Attendees can enjoy a new event called “UFO-Spotting with your Favorite Researchers.” On July 5, 6 and 7, one hundred people each evening will go to a designated site north of Roswell to spend the night searching the sky for UFOs with world-famous UFO researchers. They will enjoy a gourmet dinner, drinks and snacks throughout the night, and a full-service breakfast before returning to Roswell. Attendees can view stars and planets through the commercial 20\" and 11\" telescopes on site, and can ask ques- tions of Peter Lipscomb, published astrophotographer, stargazer and life- long student of the sky. The deadline to sign up for this event is May 31 st . Plenty of activities are planned: a spectacular 4 th of July fireworks display; the world-famous Murphy Bros. Exposition Carnival; musical entertainment by The Alan Parsons Project and 20 other national and regional bands; and appearances by Dean Haglund (“Langley” from the X- Files) and cartoonist Doug Ogg introducing his new book. For fun you can enjoy helicopter rides, hot-air balloon rides, the Alien Costume Contest, the annual night parade and invasion, Laser-Tag, theatrical plays, running events, static air displays and about 30 more events.

Box 720, Ravensdale, WA 98022, ISBN 0-937663-11-56x9 soft cover, 286 pages, $18.00. Reviewed by Dwight Connelly Instances of UFOs appearing in conjunction with Bigfoot are rare, the best example being the Oct. 25, 1973, case in Fayette County, PA, investi- gated by veteran researcher Stan Gordon. While there are no flying saucers in this book by Sali Sheppard- Wolford, it does include strange balls of light—both near and far—plus numerous encounters with what the Native Americans call Skookum. The author also tried to research a reported airplane crash related to a UFO, but discovered that the news- papers describing the event had mys- teriously disappeared. Her research also seemingly triggered an appearance by Men in Black. She also associated, apparently in a dream state, with another Native American, a spiritual guide she calls Dream Walker, who showed her scenes from the past and provided glimpses of the future. Thus this is an account which features both the paranormal and the more “normal,” including physical tracks left by Bigfoot and multiple sightings by former “non-believers,” including the author’s husband. The author’s daughter, Autumn, who wrote the Forward, was a small child during the four years described in this book, but the events made such an impression on her that she has been a Bigfoot researcher for the past 17 years (www.oregonbigfoot.com). She says that there are “two types of witnesses to this phenomenon: incidental and long-term.” She concludes that her time is better spent interviewing the long-term witnesses “who, like my family, claimed ongoing encounters near their residences.” Book Review In March 2007, the website www .UFOPOP .or g (Flying Saucers in Popular Culture) marked its second anniversary. The purpose of UFOPOP is to preserve and display images of UFOs and Flying Saucers as presented in the media of our “popular culture” including comic books, magazine and book covers, advertising and products, toys and games, and more. Beginning with a thousand comic book images, the site has grown to over 5,400 images. Over 1,300 books from 1950 to the present are pictured. The Magazine Gallery includes images of over 1,362 magazine covers, from 1915 to the present—yes, the MUFON UFO Journal is included. Valley of the Skookum is a personal account of the author’s four years of experiences with the creatures and the people who live along the Carbon River in a sparsely settled area of western Washington State in the 1970s. Bigfoot—Skookum—comes across as frightening, due to its size, its strangeness, its disgusting odor, and its habit of showing up near dwellings. However, the author suggests that it is more curious than dangerous. Tracks, sightings and peculiar sounds suggest it frequently observed the human residents in the area. The author feels she has a special quality that enables her to relate to Skookum, although she was certainly not the only person to see the Bigfoot families. She is not a Native American, but has a strong affinity for them, and became good friends with Youdi, a Native American lady who taught her various crafts and helped her to understand Skookum. The Merchandising Gallery now has 1,600 ads, products, and promo- tional items which clearly show the extent to which UFO/Flying Saucer and alien imagery have permeated our culture. A Toy Gallery is under construc- tion, to be followed by a Miscellaneous Gallery for those things which just don’t fit elsewhere.

Friedman Stanton Friedman Maybe I just have an aversion to signing UFO petitions. Perhaps I am appalled by the incredible naivety and Chutzpah of those circulating them. The most recent request for gathering millions of signatures comes from the Exopolitics movement with a “World UFO Disclosure Campaign.” Its aim is “To Have U.N. General Assembly to hold open and secrecy-free hearings on the UFO/ET presence on Earth. And to hold open hearings on advanced energy and propulsion systems related to the subject that, when publicly released, will provide solutions to global environmental and other challenges.” Since when did the U.N. General Assembly have any power to compel testimony from individuals covered by national security arrangements? I worked under security for 14 years for several companies working on government-sponsored classified research and development programs. There was certainly not the slightest indication that the U.N. had a role in determining whether or not I could reveal classified information. Has some magic event occurred that would cause national governments to abandon all security? It is precisely advanced propulsion systems with which I was concerned. Surely researchers in the U.K., France, Russia, China, India, Israel, Pakistan, Iran, etc. have no more incentive than do U.S. researchers to release classified data. The basic rule for security is that one cannot tell one’s friends without telling one’s enemies. There are clearly a lot of enemies out there, or why else is the United States spending roughly half a trillion dollars per year on things military? Does it really make sense to put any technological secrets which have been obtained from study of UFO behavior and wreckage out where the Osama Bin Ladens of the world can buy them? Yes, I certainly agree with the petitioners that “it is a well established fact that UFOs are a world-wide phenomenon.” For decades I have been demonstrating that the subject of flying saucers represents a kind of Cosmic Watergate, and indeed that some few people within the US and other governments know that Earth is being visited. I have also noted that I did not believe new technical data should be put out that is readily accessible to terrorists, petty dictators and other “bad guys.” If we have learned new techniques for tracking alien invaders in our skies, should they be shared with countries who would use them to detect and track our military aircraft responding to an attack? Many people seem to believe. . . I have found that many people seem to believe—since we have wreckage from Roswell and other crashes of alien craft—that we have necessarily learned out to duplicate the craft. I have seen no evidence of that. If we have, why have we not used these new super special vehicles in all the wars we have been engaged in over the last 60 years? I don’t think Christopher Columbus, if he had been given an unlimited budget and an SR 71 or a nuclear submarine or a Saturn 5 rocket or my home computer, could have built any of these in 1493 or even 1893. Some people think that the reason for the rapid and incredibly extensive development of new technology since World War II must be the result of back engineering UFO technology. I strongly disagree. I think the major reason has been the huge expenditures of money (and people) in advanced R and D programs—many of them, at least temporarily, black budget programs. People are shocked when I point out that the General Electric Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion program on which I worked from 1956-1959 had a 1958 budget of $100 million. We employed 3,500 people of whom 1,100 were engineers and scientists. We also took advantage of government-owned facilities and equipment and of government-supplied enriched uranium; and, so far as I have been able to tell, there are no nuclear- powered airplanes flying around even though we actually did operate jet engines on nuclear power. The annual black budget is variously estimated at 30-50 billion dollars. The three nuclear weapons labs employ more than 20,000 people in total and spend over $3 billion per year. That is more than the total budget of the National Science Foundation. Other countries such as On Petitions and Petitioners, and UFO Technology"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"      15 MUFON UFO Journal May 2007 Friedman: Does the US Have UFO Technology? Continued from page 14 Russia and China have large classified development programs. There was never a time before WWII when so much money, effort and resources were devoted to developing advanced military and other technology. UFOs certainly might have stimulated a variety of research programs. No evidence we are using UFO technology I am, of course, not saying that we and other countries haven’t learned anything of interest from studying both wreckage and measurements of flight characteristics on board satellites and aircraft chasing UFOs. I suggest some examples in my book Top Secret/ Majic . But where is there any evidence of any sort that we have come up with solutions—now being covered up—that will provide solutions to global environment and other challenges?? The Disclosure Project has frequently claimed that, in effect, the secret of free energy has been obtained from study of UFOs. Certainly I have seen no such evidence. For example, if we have learned to build and operate a magnetoaerodynamic propulsion system that works by ionizing the air around a craft in the atmosphere and interacting with that electrically conducting fluid to create lift, drag, prevention of sonic boom production, heating, etc., without using fossil fuels, why weren’t such systems used in recent wars? The Stealth Fighter was developed in secret at great cost... and was used in the Gulf War. Remember, it isn’t enough to determine theoretically how advanced systems for atmospheric flight and interstellar travel (almost certainly two different systems) might work, but the theory must be reduced to practice. The hard part about the development of the atomic bomb wasn’t the theory, but obtaining plutonium and enriching uranium. At one time the Manhattan Project was using almost 10% of the electrical power in the United States to provide enriched uranium. It would, for example, be useful to develop more efficient refrigerators, but how could people afford to replace the old ones? The sun and wind are free but they are not available all the time and the converters are definitely not free. The United States has certainly not shown a great will to build more nuclear power plants to replace burning fossil fuels in a hurry. China plans to build about thirty. Furthermore, have we really worked hard at improving the rail systems of the country? Perhaps I should add that I was one of a number of scientists who presented papers about UFOs at the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1978. We were very well received. The primary purpose as introduced by Eric Gairy of Granada was to have the UN establish a central clearing house for UFO reports from all over the world. There was interest, but the United States put the kibosh on that. Certainly there were no presentations by anybody of classified government data from the US or anywhere else. More helpful to release the data I think it would be far more productive to push the US government to release all the data it has on UFO sightings that could effect National Security, but that, according to General Carroll Bolender in his memo of 1969, were not part of the Blue Book System, but were reported under Joint Army Navy Air Force Publication 146 or Air Force Manual 55-11. How about pushing for amnesty to allow military persons who had been involved in Roswell, or other events prior to 1950, to speak without penalty? After all, the USAF has persistently claimed that no UFO reported, evaluated or investigated by the US Air Force gives any threat to National Security. They have also claimed that what was recovered near Roswell in July, 1947, was not an alien spacecraft. How could they prosecute anybody for talking about a Mogul Balloon and crash test dummies? Speaking of Roswell, 60 years after the event, another petition that I didn’t sign was one distributed by Airline Pilot Kent Jeffrey a number of years ago after he had become convinced that Roswell represented the crash of an alien spacecraft. Of course, he became disillusioned, partly because he had bought into the false testimony of the late Frank Kaufmann that Roswell was real. Unfortunately, he pulled a bait and switch. He spoke about Roswell, but the petition was to get the government to release any and all UFO information it had, rather than just about Roswell. Understandably Kent never had a security clearance. Again this would include any technical data that had been obtained. I didn’t then and don’t now think such data should be out there. I didn’t sign his petition despite my strong conviction that indeed the US government recovered two crashed flying saucers in New Mexico in July, 1947, as reported in “Crash at Corona.” The exopolitical types claim in their request for signatures that “We should all together concentrate our efforts on one goal: to bring the truth about the UFO phenomenon to light.” That sounds good. What does it mean? Who decides what is truth? I know that the movement people seem to have accepted every whistleblower tale that has come out.

My goal is to report by electronic journal the next expedition when funds become available. Individuals will be able to “go along” on the expedition via our daily reports to the journal, along with digital images and video. Special Investigations Unit The Special Investigation Unit is a team of five with the primary objective of inserting itself into areas of devel- oping activity. The team is composed of: Thomas Ferrario — Missouri MUFON Assistant Director of Investigations. He has been an independent investigator and re- searcher for over 35 years, and is the Co- Founder of the MUFON Dive Team along with Debbie Ziegelmeyer. Adam Johnson — MUFON Field Investiga- tor and Missouri MUFON Assistant State Director for Public Information. Adam has researched the UFO phenomenon for over ten years.

April 16 - two observations, both aerial. Tom Ferrario and I were at the site on March 23 collecting informa- tion, but we had no sightings at the time. Site Two, designated as WM, is located in Arkansas. Witnesses request that no names or locations be released, although all are on file. In this area small circular objects have been seen and photographed in daylight and at night. The objects appear bright metallic in daylight, glowing a dull orange at night. In a typical daylight observation, multiple witnesses photographed a small metallic object leaving what appears to be a pulsing trail. The photograph clearly shows the object making a right-angle turn from vertical to horizontal. The objects have been seen flying from the primary location at altitudes of less than 100 feet, making several right-angle turns. In one case a small circular object landed less than 300 feet from two witnesses in daylight. It remained on the ground for several minutes and then vanished instantly. Currently we are investigating two April 2007 cases from southwest Missouri and central Missouri; one involves video of multiple light sources and repeat sightings. These are also multiple witness events involving very credible individuals. I can be contacted by email at archaeoanom@inter-linc.net if you have questions or information. Date: Since early 2007. Cases reported in March 2007 Location: Luis Munoz Marin International Airport, Carolina, P.R. Time: Daylight hours; at night between 8:20 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. Witness: Airport worker (The pseudonym “Mr. Rodriguez” is used here, as the witness is fearful of being dismissed should his real name become known.) Evidence: None Brief Description of Object: Round light larger than an airplane, very bright; other lights of greater intensity and size, white in color, triangle shaped. Summary: Mr. Rodriguez (pseudonym) works at one of the airport’s offices. He has a view of the new airport control tower from his window, as well as of El Yunque and other landmarks. Rodriguez claims that this year, some lights have been seen hovering over the new tower, remaining static and then disappearing. These lights are either white or red in color (Note: researcher Ana Rios has seen lights similar to those described by Mr. Rodriguez from her apartment in Isla Verde, and which appear to be triangular when making a turn). Rodriguez also claims to see a very large, powerful light between 8:20–8:30 PM, white and triangular shaped. He compares this light to the brightness of an airliner belonging to San Martin Air, adding that the UFO’s light is even stronger than the lights on this aircraft. He says that whenever he’s with a customer and sees the lights, he points them out and they too are startled. When he makes inquiries among pilots, they always say they’ve seen nothing at all. (He believes they’ve been told not to speak for fear of dismissal). The triangular UFO impresses the witness greatly for its size, shape and brightness. When he realized that, at the time that his sightings usually occur, there is also a scheduled American Eagle flight at 8:20 pm toward Vieques, he decided to board this flight with a skeptical friend to see the object more closely and to get his friend to believe him. Rodriguez says that as the American Eagle flight gained altitude, it was necessary to look toward Route #3, as this is where the light appears to emerge from, toward the beach area. The UFO approached the plane sufficiently [for him to realize] that it was larger than the airliner. It then made a U-turn, heading toward Fajardo, and then Vieques, as though heading for nearby islands. Rodriguez says that he alerted all of the passen- gers and asked the co-pilot about the strange light. The pilot replied [in English]: “Forget about it,” which led Rodriguez to believe that the pilots are forbidden to discuss what is going on, or else did not want to alarm them. Comments: Rodriguez wants a group of researchers to go with cameras and turn them on as soon as the passenger plane gains altitude, focusing them on Route #3 and El Yunque in order to record it. He added that the same event happened on the return trip from Vieques to San Juan. Report forwarded to MUFON by John Schuessler Incident reported to: Lucy Guzman, Ovni.Net.

K Illinois Hovering Red Light ALGONQUIN —I was running on a Thursday night April 5, 2007 at around 8:30 PM, it was cold but clear and I saw a red light hovering in the distance about 1000 feet in height. I stopped running for a moment [to watch]. It was bright and had a humming sound. It dropped something out of it, a light or a probe-like thing. It went to the ground and seemed to go underground, then the craft dimmed in light and moved to the left very fast and made a quick turn straight up almost an instant 90 degree turn. I know an airplane cannot do this. I felt like I was being watched, so I continued running and went home. Was this a meteor, UFO or what? Please let me know because a lot of people around here are seeing things but they are too embarrassed to admit it. Thanks to MUFON CMS Massachusetts Trees Lit Up Green WILLIAMSTOWN —The reporter states: “I was hunting coyotes at 6:00 AM on April 13, 2007, when I glanced to my left and saw a bright white object hovering halfway up the mountain. Five minutes later it moved left slowly and then took off, faster than anything I have ever seen.” A week later he saw something again. He said he turned away and looked back and it was still there, hovering just to the left of the Taconic trail and the “trees lit up green.” He watched to see if it would take off again but it never did. “It was unnerving this time. I could tell it was red and green lights blinking. With my binoculars, I could see the lights but couldn’t see the shape.” Thanks to Christopher Montgomery, Editor-in-Chief http:// uforc.com/ Michigan Cylinder Pattie Donahue writes, “My daughter and I observed a white tubular/cigar-shaped object on many different dates, times, and locations. I would be outside, when I would get the very clear familiar feeling/thought to “Look Up,” and there would be a white tubular cigar-shaped object just sitting there in the sky. It would always be no more than maybe 3-4 stories above me. The first few times it would just sit there for ten seconds, then just vanish, disappear. I never had time to run in and get my camera. Other times, I would look up, it would be just sitting there, suddenly start moving, then vanish into thin air.” Minnesota One Triangle and the Other Cross EDEN PRAIRIE —My friend and I were driving almost to Apple Valley on Highway 77, around 8:30 pm, on April 8, 2007, and we looked up and saw lights. The three lights on the corners of this UFO looked like a plane at first, but when we got closer it was a weird triangle and one by one they turned on with multicolored lights in the middle. The first object was hovering in one spot and was pretty low to the ground too, maybe five hundred feet above the trees! We kept driving and I could see it was still there. Then we saw another object in the shape of a cross with a glowing light on each end. It looked like a big box was on top of it, and it had two weird flashing lights with abnormally large white lights on the ends of the cross. This object was also hovering and did not move from the spot it was in! When we passed by I looked back and I saw both of the objects still in the same place above the highway. At 8:45 PM, near our destination I could see two really bright lights with a third object coming towards us. So there was a total of three craft. We arrived at our friends house but they had not seen anything. After three hours we drove back on the same highway and saw three bright blue objects in different parts of the sky. Thanks to MUFON CMS Montana Orange Lights HAVRE —My daughter was driving home shortly after dark on April 12, 2007, from her boyfriend’s ranch in the Bears Paw Mountains outside of Havre, when she noticed an unusual light in the sky. She said the color was fire like orange and very bright. She pulled the truck up and watched it as it split into two orange lights. One flew away and then flew quickly back together and joined the one it had left. She said the head lights, and the dashboard lights went out, but she said"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"      19 MUFON UFO Journal May 2007 Filer’s Files Continued from page 18 MUFON Members Message Board mufonmembers.proboards55.com Password: Hynek1947 (case sensitive) the music on the CD player kept playing.

I’m kind of a UFO buff after having many sightings in my life, but she always treats me like I’m weird. Well, now this is her third sighting, but the only one so close up and while she was alone. She was scared! Thanks to MUFON CMS TROUT LAKE —James Gilliland writes, “On Tuesday April 10, 2007 from 9:30 to 10:45 PM, anomalous lights were spotted all crossing the same point near the handle of the Big Dipper. According to Heavens-Above satellite and space station schedules there was only one iridium flare scheduled for the evening. One of the ships fired a beam which lit up an object near the handle of the Big Dipper causing it to disappear. There were what looked like two military jets which vectored in on the same area on the same course of two of the larger UFOs. One of the ships powered up just in front of the jet and there is no way the pilot could have missed it. Most of this was caught on film, all but the beam due to not showing up in the view finder. We are still working on the technology and expertise to capture the footage and send it out on the net. I would suggest going out over the next few days and watch the handle of the Big Dipper for your own personal experience. Something very strange is unfolding there. Thanks to James Gilliland www.eceti.org Texas Three Lights in Triangular Shape SLOCUM —About 130 Miles east- southeast of Dallas, the witness was outside “star gazing” and saw a bright light towards the southwest on April 11, 2007, at 5:10 AM. The light went out and then three lights appeared in a triangular configuration. The three lights were followed by a red light (at times). The light configuration (object) moved erratically side to side and made a few circles. The witness heard no sound and observed the object for about 5 minutes. The object then shot off rapidly to the south and disappeared. Jupiter was visible in the southwest at the time of sighting. Investigator’s Notes: The witness was quite excited by what he saw. He said that he routinely looks at the sky when he gets up in the morning. He at once noticed the bright light. I don’t think that the sighting was the result of Jupiter given what the witness reported. Given available information I have no explanation of what the witness saw. Thanks to Bill Pluckett UFOs Northwest. http://ufosnw.com/ Canada Sightings Increase MISSISSAUGA , Ontario—On March 30, 2007, I went out to smoke in the balcony at around 4 AM, and noticed a lighted flying object approaching my apartment building from the southwest. As it flew nearer I saw one bright white light. It turned left and remained in one position for about 15 minutes. I woke up my wife to witness this peculiar object. We both could clearly see a flying saucer with three beams of light emitting from its base. My 11-year-old daughter also woke up, and saw the object swinging left, then right. It zoomed up with its light fading above the clouds. It flew back to its original position, and stayed glued till 6 AM when it again shot upwards above the clouds. GRIMSBY , Ontario—I was driving home from Grimsby on Thursday or Friday evening March 29 or 30, 2007, when I chanced to glance to the north of the QEW Highway and saw a metallic floating object about five meters above a house by the lake. It was not what I expected, as it looked like a rotating metal fly strip. It was just sitting there bigger than the house it was rotating above. Then it looked like the sun was shining off it and it was gone. MEXICO: Cross shaped UFO videotaped TEPEXPAN —On Good Friday, April 6, Mr. Victor Gabriel Gonzalez managed to record the transit of several unidentified flying objects. Several spheres crossed the sky at two o’clock in the afternoon, heading south. Later a large cross-shaped object approached and slowed but increased its glow, before heading toward the sun, where it was lost from sight. Therefore, both Victor and Ana Luisa Cid prefer to remain objective and present the material as a possible UFO, without ascribing religious or fantastic connotations to it.

Their claims are definitely phony. Kind of amazing that neither could provide copies of any of the eight diplomas they supposedly have between them. The legal counsel at MIT assured me that it is not possible to wipe out all records of an individual who had a degree from there. Furthermore MIT doesn’t admit people from high school who finished in the bottom third of their class and had only one science course, as was the case for Lazar. The physicist he claimed would remember him from California Institute of Technology never taught Friedman: On Petitioners, UFO Technology Continued from page 15 there, but only at Pierce Junior College, near LA where Bob was indeed in one of his courses at the same time when he was supposedly at MIT 2,500 miles away!

Stan Friedman fsphys@rogers.com www .stantonfriedman.com Dear Editor, Regarding the April 2007 Journal article on the Cisco Grove Bow & Ar- row case from 1964. On page 5 it states that declassified Blue Book documents detail [that] Don and Judy Shrum were interviewed by Air Force Captain McCloud and Sgt. Major Barnes. This got my attention because the USAF has no such rank. A Sgt. Major is grade E-9 in the U.S. Army. The article also mentions an episode of the 1977-78 NBC program about Air Force Blue Book investigations. The correct name of the program was Project UFO , not Project Blue Book . James E. Delehanty, USAF (Ret.) Jeffersonville, Indiana Author Steve Reichmuth responds to Mr. Delehanty’s comments. Thank you to Mr. Delehanty, USAF (Ret.) for kindly pointing out these issues. I wish to express some disappointment and concern that cer- tain points of my article as edited may have created some confusion. The correct title of the 1970s tele- vision series that highlighted the Shrum case in one series episode was indeed called Project UFO , not Project Blue Book . We have checked our sources and the rank of Sergeant Major in the article was an error, as this is a rank used in the U.S. Army. There is a Master Sergeant E7 that is equiva- lent to a Sergeant Major. The Air Force official that interviewed the Shrums was a sergeant. Incidentally, Judy Shrum’s father was a Senior Master Sergeant in the USAF. Two more corrections: The date of the Donald Shrum experience in the Journal is incorrect. Donald Shrum’s experience occurred on September 4-5, 1964. In the his- tory of this case, the actual date was questioned and clarified early on. The Journal also states the Shrum family never met personally with NICAP/later MUFON Chief Investiga- tor Paul Cerny. [In fact, they] never met personally with [Investigator] Richard Hall, but the Shrum family were in personal contact with the late Paul Cerny many times. They had de- veloped a close trust. Mr. Cerny’s in- volvement should be praised in his objectivity, attention to detail, and the great amount of time over his life that he devoted to this particular case, important in the history of ufology.

Congratulations to Kenneth E. Cherry (Texas), Tracey C. Smith (Kansas), Donald R. Burleson (New Mexico) for being 1st, 2nd and 3rd respectively in the month of April. The report is based on our two measures of UFO Investigation effectiveness. Assigning reports within 48 hours of receipt, and completing all investigations within 60 days of being assigned. The “Assigned” column is a six month running average of the number of cases assigned within 48 hours divided by the total number of cases received in that six month period. The “Completed” column is the number of cases completed beginning sixty-two (62) days back and going back six months from there (for a total of eight months back) divided by the total number of cases reported in the same period. The “Weighted Rank” is just the average of the two columns expressed as a percent. State Directors can improve their scores by being sure to assign all cases within 48 hours, and by follow- ing up with their Field Investigators to ensure all reports are completed within 60 days. To be considered complete a report must have been investigated and placed in one of the three com- pleted status codes (Unknown, Hoax or IFO) by you the State Director.

MUFON Director’s Message Continued from page 2 possible taking off point for the jets, but the airstrips are no longer in use as the Grumman headquarters in Bethpage no longer exists. The airstrips have long since been overgrown with vegetation, preventing their usage even if the Grumman headquarters was still active. The initial take off point of the jet fighters remains a mystery, as does their purpose and ultimate destination, and so one can only theorize that there are hidden airstrips somewhere that are enabling the jets to take off in the area. Conclusions: After speaking to the witnesses and analyzing the informa- tion, I feel that this is an authentic UFO case, as no conventional explanation could be reached regarding the identity of the two objects. Any kind of known meteorological phenomena can be safely ruled out, as the objects did not remain stationary in the sky but flew in a straight path over the house of the main witness. Any explanation of meteors or comets can be discounted, as the reported UFOs bore no resem- blance to either of those natural phenomena, and there was no “tail” reported as would be expected from a meteor. It is highly unlikely that the objects were any conventional aircraft due to the descriptions that were given.There is the possibility that the two UFOs were blimps of some kind, but it would probably be safe to rule it out. While there is always the possibility of a hoax or delusion, all of the witnesses appeared to be psychologically stable and honest. If it was a hoax being played on them, then it would be one of immense complexity, and isn’t very likely. As far as any possible additional witnesses, I phoned Republic Airport and inquired about any reported UFO sightings, receiving a negative, and called the Bethpage Police Department and received the same answer from them, so the identity of the pilot in the private plane remains a mystery, as does the identities of anyone else who might have also witnessed the objects.
