FROM THE EDfTOR Several articles and letters in this issue confront the problem of hyp- nosis applied to UFO witnesses generally, and Prof. Alvin H. Lawson's Birth Trauma (BT) Hypothesis for \"abduction\" cases specifically. These are central issues bearing on interpretation of \"abduction\" reports worthy of searching inquiry. Hypnosis, clearly, is a useful tool when properly applied, but it has its limitations and can easily be abus- ed or misused. Certainly it is naive to think that what emerges under hypnosis must be taken as \"absolute truth.\" \"Abductee\" stories no doubt contain some mixture — and the proportions are critical — of fact, fantasy, and creative imagination. As is true of so many other aspects of the UFO problem, we need well-qualified, \"objective\" (easy to say, hard to define) analysts to weigh the pros and cons, and to fur- nish guidelines on how to proceed in order to sort out the truth.

Kprff and William L: Moore (©1982) One of the marks which distinguishes an expert yarn-spinner from an ordinary storyteller is his ex- pertise in manufacturing, exag- gerating, or distorting details at ran- dom and upon the spur of the mo- ment in order that he may continue to sound convincing and credible to his listeners. Given such criteria, \"Ka| Korff and the Tvleier Hoax': A Response\" by Wendelle C. Stevens (MUFON UFO Journal, Nos. 164-165) should be eligible for some sort of prize. Either Wendelle Stevens regards his shameless efforts to foist the Meier case upon both legitimate UFOlogy and unsuspecting UFO \"buffs\" alike as some sort of tremen- dously funny personal joke (in which case let's all laugh and forget about it), or he honestly thinks that those who bother to double check his \"facts\" and find them wanting will conceal their results solely to protect his (already precarious) reputation. In either case, it is our opinion that this disgraceful charade has gone on long enough. Stevens' \"Response\" to the points raised in Korff's expose of the Meier case are neither convincing nor ter- ribly new. Worse, his ad hominem at- tack on Korff's alleged immaturity hardly befits a gentleman and is at the very least irrelevant to the matter at hand. While Korff's anti-Meier book (The Meier Incident: Most Infamous Hoax in UFOlogy: Town Scribe Press, 1981) may have put him on the map per se, his interest in UFO reports did not begin when he decided to look into the Swiss contactee case in earnest back in early 1980. Indeed, Wendelle Stevens has known of Korff for over 5 years, their first exchange of letters having begun on September 14, 1976. (A copy of this letter is in MUFON's file's.) As to why UFOlogy has more or less looked to Koriff for information on the Meier case, the reason is ac- tually quite simple. It is obvious from his writings that he has thoroughly researched and investigated both the incident itself and those connected with it. His book is an authoritative compilation of the results and conclu- sions of that investigation. And ironically, there are more hard facts set forth therein than there are in the entire Genesis III Pleiades volume. The statement that appears in Korff's book to the effect that Meier has recorded over 3,000 pages of \"quotes\" from the \"Pleiadeans\" is most certainly true in spite of Stevens' protestations to the contrary. Meier's contactee ramblings consist of a total of ele_ven volumes, five of which Korff viewed himself in the presence of Dr. Marcel Vogel. Much of this material was allegedly \"channeled\" through Meier by the Pleiadeans via the so-called \"automatic writing\" technique. If Wendelle had read Kal's article carefully, he would have noticed that Korff said, \"He has also been given rock and metal samples which, accor- ding to his story, defy conventional explanation.\" As anyone even remotely familiar ..with, the English language can tell, the two pronouns used, \"he\" and \"his\", refer to Meier and not Stevens. Even more ridiculous, however, is Steven's boldfaced contention that the phrase \"defy conventional explanation\" can be interpreted in a manner substan- tially different from the words used in his own phrase \"not immediately ex- plainable... in reference to our present technology.\" Having now succeeded in manufac- turing dirt from earth, Stevens goes on to claim that neither he nor his Genesis III associates \"declare, anywhere in the book, that all, or even any of Meier's claims are ge- nuine.\" Truth? Wrong again. Unless of course Stevens expects us to believe that the statement 'This book is not a work of fiction,\" which begins the flapcopy, somehow got there by accident. And what about Stevens' own statement which appears in the text of the book itself: \"...we are im- pelled to a conclusion that the ex- perience actually happened, that the disc-shaped craft photographed is really a UFO and that th& case is legitimate\"? Korff made no misquotations as to Meier's first claims of contacts. All he pointed out was that according to Stevens' book, Meier's first ex- periences with extraterrestrials began on January 28, 1975. Unfortunately for Wendelle, this is not the case. Ac- cording to articles written by Stevens himself and published in the now defunct Argosy UFO magazine, Meier's first sighting of a UFO occur- red on June 2, 1942 when only 5 years old! But even granting that Genesis Ill's 'It all began...\" statement is merely a poor choice of words, Stevens' claim that he and his associates were unable to include details about Billy Meier's earlier con- tactee experiences because of space limitations in the book is pure and unadulterated hogwash! In fact, even the most casual and impartial observer is able to see at once that their book is literally brimming over with unused space. Even by conser- vative measurement (and not taking in- to account the unnecessarily . large type used), there is in the- neighborhood of 950 square inches (more than 6Vi square feet) of totally unused, absolutely blank space in the Pleiades book! After reading Wendelle's statement that he is not \"a one-fourth partner in Genesis III,\" we began to fear that Stevens is either a pathological liar or is suffering from delusions. Apparent- ly he has forgotten that he told Korff (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Contact, Continued ' ' • ; <'• in writing that he was indeed a \"one fourth partner in Genesis III.\" (A copy of the letter in question has been pro- vided for MUFON's files so that there can be no question in this matter.) Stevens' statement that Meier sought no publicity from anyone con- cerning any of his experiences is also demonstrably false. Meier first began . publishing and offering for sale all over Europe numerous little pam- phlets about his \"encounters\" in September of 1976, long 'before Stevens -was even aware of his (Meier's) existence. Not only do we know this to be a fact, but two samples (of the well over a dozen that we possess) of Meier's literature appear on page 27 of Korff's book! Wendelle has at least three copies of Kal's monograph, but still insists upon publishing such statements. (Copies of some of Meier's privately published pamphlets have been provided for MUFON's files including the issue where he claims to be the 14th disci- ple of Jesus Christ.) According to an associate of ours, Mr. Franco Kleppe, who also resides in Switzerland, there exists no evidence (in the form of official police records) of any assassination attempts on either Meier's life or that of Wendelle Stevens. It should be pointed out that Herr Kleppe is ex- tremely familiar with the Meier's claims, having been a devout believer in them, and spent several months as a part of the Swiss contactee's \"com- mune\" of followers. Kleppe has even met the \"Pleiadean cosmonaut\" Sen- jase, and has assured us that she is \"quite human\" — especially when plying her trade in one of Switzerland's better known back alleys. Stevens did indeed describe Meier as \"a .sort of person who gets great satisfaction out of fooling authorities,\" despite his claims to the contrary. Wendelle not only told Jim Lorenzen this over breakfast one mor- ning in Tucson, where among other things he talked about Meier's criminal record, but he also told Korff, Al Reed, and Paul Cerny the same thing on August 23, 1980 in 4 Oakland, California. Wendelle's ac- count of this affair, as set forth in his \"Response,\" is totally at odds with that provided by Jim Lorenzen who first told it to Moore a few days after the event and more recently recalled precisely the same details in a December 1981 interview. Yet another telling point is Stevens' ludicrous claim that De Anza Systems is not mentioned in his book. (\"We did not say, nor does the book imply, that De Anza Systems 'did some of the analysis.' \") Please note that in the \"Acknowledgement\" section of the original version of Pleiades, the follow- ing clearly appears: ...our thanks go to De Anza Systems, Inc., manufacturers of the remarkable state-of-the- art computer graphics systems utilized to better illustrate some of the test procedures... (Curiously this particular passage was conveniently omitted in the so-called \"revised\" version of the book.) In ad- dition, apparently one of the Colonel's friends responsible for do- ing layout on the book did a poor job of masking, for when one carefully checks the \"Computer and Laser Photo Examination\" section of Pleiades, one finds De Anza Systems mentioned again—this time at the ex- treme right edge of computer enhancement photos No. 2 and 6 (from right to left) depicted on page 53 (also note that one must count the pages because they are not numbered). If this isn't an \"implica- tion\" that De Anza had something to do with the analysis, then what is it? For the record, it was through reading Wendelle's book that Korff first learned of De Anza Systems and thus contacted them. Both Korff and Moore conducted personal interviews with officials of De Anza, and learned that the Genesis III involvement with that company were indeed somewhat curious. Stevens and his associates did not go to De Anza because they had the best equipment for this sort of work, but because they claimed that they were interested in purchasing equipment and wanted a free demonstration. In the words of Ken Din- widdie, the \"edge identification\" man referred to by Stevens, De Anza's equipment is not analytical in nature.\" The sole reason that De Anza elected to demonstrate enhancement techniques on some of the Meier photos was because they honestly believed that they were dealing with potential customers for their product. Stevens and Jim Dilettosb then proceeded to take photographs off of the display screens with a small polaroid camera and never returned. According to all accounts, in- cluding Stevens to Moore in June of 1981, it was Jim Dilettoso who was the so-called \"expert\" utilized by Genesis III to do their \"testing.^' Dilet- toso's impeccable credentials consist of 6 years at the University of Con- necticut without benefit of a degree; and considerable experience with \"laser\" light displays for rock con- certs. A check of Science Citations Index (an exhaustive index of virtually every scientific paper published in the U.S. by author, source, and year) for the years 1975-1981, lists not one single, paper published by a James Dilettoso on the subject of computer analysis procedures, or for that matter on any other subject. The report by Dr. Neil Davis that Wendelle referred to does not state that Meier's photos, or at least the one photo that Davis examined, are authentic. When Korff spoke to Dr. Davis, he was informed that the analysis was by no means conclusive because, \"...the print that Wendelle gave me, claiming it was a second generation print, was at least third generation or better. Therefore, my analysis was pretty much in- conclusive.\" Davis' statement that nothing was found during his ex- amination of the print in question which would indicate a hoax, was seized upon by Genesis III to automatically mean that there was no hoax — a convenient exaggeration on their part similar in nature to a cub reporter concluding at the scene of a crime that because no fingerprints were found, no crime could have been committeed. (Copies of Davis' report have been provided for MUFON's files.) The 23 \"witnesses\" that Stevens refers to are, in reality, the number of (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Contact, Continued followers that Meier has recruited. Like the \"Bo and Peep\" scam of a few years ago, those who wish to \"follow\" Meier's teachings must relinquish per- sonal property and a lot of money. We find it curious that Stevens men- tions none of this; nor does he men- tion that Meier currently charges $50.00 per hour (Swiss F.100,oo) to grant interviews to the press. As to the question of the point of origin of Billy Meier's \"alien visitors,\" if they are not from the Pleiades, then why are they repeatedly referred to as \"Pleiadeans\"? Why is Wendelle's book entitled UFO ... Contact from the Pleiades! Why does the text on page 21 (again, count the pages — they aren't numbered) clearly state, \"It was from the Pleiades, The Seven Sisters', that these cosmonauts came.\"? Why are Semjase, Asket, Ptaal, and Plaja repeatedly referred to as \"Pleiadean cosmonauts\"? Why can't. Stevens even get his story straight? The statement that Korff made in his book which claims that the Pleiades are only \"some tens of millions of years old\" was based On in- formation supplied to him in a letter date August 25, 1980 from Dr. J. Allen Hynek. Hynek, of all people, should know what he's talking about when he says that the Pleiades \"are just about the worst group of stars (for extraterrestrial life) possible.\" After all, Hynek has been a profes- sional astronomer for more than 40 years. For those who require a \"less biased\" authority, however, well- known astronomer Robert Jastrow places the age of the stars in the Pleiades cluster at only 60 million years in his recent book Red Giants and White Dwarfs (NY: Norton, 1979). Since the stars of the Pleiades cluster are mainly \"type A\", stars, it should be obvious to even the most casual astronomy buff that the chances of them being \"one billion years old\" is nil. Type A stars only have a lifespan of about 500 million years, and none is known to be much older — including those that exist in the Pleiades. The notion that Meier had no financial resources to have his camera repaired is patently absurd. If this is so, then how to explain his ability to ,bear the costs involved in purchasing and processing film sufficient to pro- duce the more than 800 color photographs he has taken of alleged Pleiadean spacecraft? Even more ab- surd, however, is the fact that Stevens & Co. certainly possessed sufficient photographic equipment during their visit to Meier in Switzerland (see the many non-UFO photos in their book) to have been able to lend (or, given the alleged tremendous importance of Meier's pictures, even give) him a camera which was functioning proper- ly. Are we to believe that such an idea never occurred to this group of supposedly competent investigators? Or is it perhaps that Meier did not want his photos to be taken with pro- perly functioning equipment? Again, contrary to Steven's claim, the statement that we made concern- ing camera optics is most certainly ac- curate. Indeed, the statement in ques- tion was written by Moore, who at one time operated his own profes- sional photo service and who is quite versed on camera, optics. However, just to prove our point, we asked Dr. Bruce Maccabee, an optical physicist by profession and photographic con- sultant to'MUFON, if we were in er- ror. Dr. Maccabee replied, in a letter dated January 6, 1982, that \"The statement...which you have called to my attention (regarding camera op- tics) is essentially correct.\" (Copy of letter provided for MUFON's files.) Dr. Vogel did not analyze just one of Meier's physical samples; he analyzed three, all of which were viewed by Korff and Sarah Rea at the doctor's home. Vogel obviously did choose to share his findings with Korff, otherwise how could Kal have quoted Dr. Vogel in his expose? Fur- thermore, Stevens' ramblings about Omni and MIT's involvement in the analysis of the Meier samples are simply not true. Dr. Robert Ogilvie, the same metallurgist who analyzed the famed Ubatuba, Brazil, UFO fragments for Omni, did analyze Meier's samples and found them to be mundane at best. A further breakdown of Ogilvie's findings was presented in the expose. On yet another point, can Stevens honestly expect us to believe that he made no attempt in his book to con- nect the \"great structures of (Earth's) history to the Pleiades\" and that his book \"only reported a few of the con- nections which had already been made by others...(which) were iden- tified with quotes\"? If this is so, then how to explain the following quotes not attributed to others which appear in the text of Pleiades! For the first time, a case continually presented known factors, not unknown... and now it presented historical connections as well. (9th page from the end, bottom of left column.) An archeological bronze medallion... (17th Century B.C.), shows...a story of celestial visitation by beings who arrived in a disc- shaped craft from the sky. The seven dots enclosed in a circle...is believed to represent the Pleiades. Wendell (sic) C. Stevens. (3d page from the end, bottom left.) And never mind the title of the chapter in question, which just hap- pens (by accident, perhaps) to be \"The Pleiadean Connection.\" Of course Genesis III made no attempt to con- nect the great structures of history to the Pleiades. Everyone else merely misinterpreted. Korff's statements about Meier claiming to have met with Jesus Christ were not based upon information sup- plied to him by Colman von Kevic- zky. The source of this information is the literature which Meier privately publishes (in German) in Europe. Von Keviczky did not spend just \"one day\" in Switzerland. This is a deliberate distortion of the truth. Keviczky was in Switzerland for four days and has previously informed Stevens of such. Also, Colman did in- deed visit one of Meier's alleged \"con- tact\" sites. He did so in company with one Hans Jacob, a former follower (now turned defector) of Meier's ,(whom Stevens claims was \"rejected\" by the Pleiadeans). On pages 31-33 of Korff's book there appear a whole group of pictures that were taken at this site. Stevens has a copy of Korff's book and even a set of these prints which were supplied to him by Kevic- zky. Curiously, in a series of photos sup- posedly taken by Meier on this site, (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Contact, Continued an alleged UFO is shown circling a large tree. In von Keviczky's photographs of the same site, the tree is missing. Stevens is on record as hav- ing given two quite different explana- tions for this apparent discrepancy. In the first instance, Stevens claimed that Meier had told him that the tree had been subjected to radiation from the Pleiadean spacecraft and had conse- quently disintegrated (even though the other vegetation in the area, and presumably Meier as well, were miraculously unaffected). Stevens' se- cond explanation, however, was somewhat better. This time, the tree was simply transported into another time dimension. Wendelle's remark about having contacted many of the individuals listed in the \"Acknowledgements\" section of Korff's book is yet another misstatement of truth, as is his claim that many of these people did not supply the information attributed to them. As proof, we openly invite any one of the individuals thus listed to write to MUFON, or to either of us directly, and state otherwise if the in- formation attributed to them is incor- rect. The statement that Korff obtained first generation copies of Meier's photographs is true. Meier freely gave' Wilfried Falk ten photos for analysis by GSW Inc. Meier also told Falk that he did intend to produce a book and \"...(that) the expert opinions of Ground Saucer Watch shall have its place in it.\" As we all know, however, GSWs opinions never ap- peared in Stevens' book. Instead, Genesis III chose to include the results of their own \"expert analysis,\" the results of which, as we have already shown, were nothing more than the product of their own imaginations. The photographs that Falk sent to GSW, and which were later forward- ed to Korff, were not in slide form, nor did they come from Hans Schutz- bach. Stevens knows better, but still insists upon mis-representing the truth. (Copies of these first generation prints have been provided for MUFON's files also.) Falk never stole any prints from Meier. Meier gave them to Falk of his own free will. It is important to note here also that Stevens' source for his assertion that \"no first generation copies of the photos were let out of Meier's hands\" is none other than Meier himself. As for the photos that Colman von Keviczky received from Hans Jacob, these were indeed stolen from Meier. ' These pictures, for those who are in- terested, show models of UFOs in the Meier barn, slightly altered Swiss farmer's hats made to look like flying saucers, and a whole array of other equally damning evidence. These photos, plus much more, appear in Korff's book. When Wendelle attempts to tackle the analysis that GSW did on Meier's photos, he makes one very dangerous assumption — that Spatial Data Systems aided GSW in their work. Anyone even remotely familiar with the operation of GSW knows that the organization contracts out to at least five firms which possess image enhancement equipment. Unfor- tunately for Wendelle Stevens, Spatial Data Systems was not the com- pany responsible for the work per- formed on the Meier photos. And so (alas) with that revelation, Stevens' lengthy argument about the supposed problems with the enhancement techniques and the alleged technical limitations of the equipment used by Spatial Data Systems is reduced quite literally to the level of absurdity since none of it has any relevant application to the situation .at hand. As of this writing, GSW has not authorized the release of the name of the contractor who did perform the enhancements in question, but suffice it to say that we are satisfied that the work was of high quality. Before we leave the subject of Spatial Data Systems, however, it seems essential here to point out that even concerning this matter, the \"in- formation\" supplied by Stevens in his supposedly authoritative response ap- pears to be seriously flawed in both quality and reliability. To begin with, Spatial Data Systems' video camera is by no means \"cheap.\" Nor is their im age enhancement equipment. The statement by Stevens that 'They didn't even have a light table and no filters and lens attachments at all for the camera\" is pure rubbish. To il- lustrate the point, we have provided to MUFON a copy of the SDS catalog of their image enhancement equip- ment, which includes the light table, filters, the histogram and pseudo den- sity slicing modes, etc. Perhaps even more indicative of Wendelle's general unreliability is his boldfaced statement that \"Spatial Data Systems... (processed photos sent to them) in a program designed for them by Dr. Bruce Maccabee... (and that) Dr. Maccabee had done a good job of designing a program where none existed previously.\" Con- trary to what Wendelle says, Dr. Bruce Maccabee never designed a pro- gram for Spatial Data Systems. Mac- cabee initially confirmed this (while expressing surprise that Stevens would even make such a statement) in a conversation with Moore in Washington, D.C., on October 26, 1981. More recently he reaffirmed it to Korff in writing as follows: / have never communicated with SDS in regards to the development of a program for them. The SDS pro- gram seems to be quite good without my help. Thus, although I appreciate the compliment...! must admit that whatever program Stevens was referring to, it was not developed by me. I can't imagine where he got this \"information\" (emphasis added). In truth, Stevens received this \"in- formation\" from Genesis Ill's own \"computer scientist,\" JinvDilettoso — a source that even Wendelle has previously characterized (verbally) as \"Unreliable,\" but by the same token continues to quote whenever it seems convenient to do so. Stevens' remarks that Genesis III conducted an independent analysis of Meier's photographs are also ques- tionable. The reason that results of a competent, impartial, independent scientific analysis of the Meier photos has never appeared is quite simply because such an analysis has never been performed. Indeed, Stevens and Genesis III have been challenged to produce their \"evidence\" for impartial evaluation, and have not only refused to do so, but have refused to even (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Contact, Continued provide the courtesy of answering the correspondence involved. In addition, even more recently, Stevens verbally admitted to Moore in Tucson that he does not possess first generation copies of any of the Meier photographs, while at the same time carefully sidestepping Moore's offer to arrange for an independent analysis of the slides he does possess — which he claims (upon assurances from none other than Billy Meier himself) are second generation copies. GSW's statement that some of the images in Meier's photographs are out-of-focus is also entirely correct. This fact becomes obvious upon mere visual examination of the photographs in question. It doesn't take a digital computer to come to this conclusion. In fact, we invite Wendelle to prove GSW wrong on this point — or any other for that matter, so long as he can stick to facts, trigonometrical calculations, etc. Stevens' quaint little \"experiment\" of having photographed a small model between 4 and 6 feet away is yet another excellent example of his inability to address the issues at hand. The question is not whether objects far away would be in focus if a pic- tune was taken of a nearby model, with the camera focused on the model. The question is whether or not one can obtain reasonable focus on a near- by model when the camera is focused \"just short of infinity,\" as (allegedly) is Meier's camera. As a matter of fact, the key to the matter is the use of as small an \"f\" stop as possible. Indeed, Moore tried a few experiments of his own and succeeded magnificently in producing good quality photos of a four inch diameter plastic UFO model. (See photos 1 & 2 which are photographed at 6 and 12 feet respec- tively. Note the wealth of objects in photo 1 which illustrate depth of field from slightly less than 5 feet to more than 15 miles.) Admittedly Moore's model is nowhere near as elaborate as Meier's, but it is sufficient to show the sort of effects than can be produced. Clearly it is possible to produce \"UFO\" photographs utilizing small models close to the camera. Moore UFO Model, Test Photo No. 1 Moore UFO Model, Test Photo No. 2 Concerning Wendelle's contention that \"the Swiss sky in (Meier's) vicini- ty is usually -white\" and that such a sky does not usually cast shadows, it should be noted that there are shadows visible in many of Meier's photos. Admittedly they are slight and take some looking, but they are there in many cases. It should be pointed out here, however, that before Genesis III published these photos in their book, they had them \"enhanced\" to make them look more presentable (or perhaps to hide any hint of balloons and supporting struc- tures?). Fortunately Korff acquired first generation copies of these photos, some of which appear in his book. As to the matter of the suspension \"string\" which clearly shows up in one of GSW's enhancements, let us begin by stating that the enhance- ment in question is not cropped. Nor are there any other \"artifacts\" present either. If one looks carefully, the str- ing does indeed extend all the way up to the top of the frame. A more refin- ed enhancement was later performed (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Contact, Continued using the color contouring, edge enhancement mode, which also revealed the entire string and verified the fact that the \"artifact\" was a sup- portive wire or thread. But just in case there may still be some doubt in this matter, Moore hereby renews his of- fer to arrange a competent indepen- dent analysis of the internegative in question, providing of course that Wendelle Stevens will agree to sub- mit same with no strings attached (no pun intended, naturally). As Dr. Maccabee has pointed out, the computer can only detect what is actually in the film to begin with. Since Meier appears to have used transparent fishing line (as did Moore in his test photos) to hang his models, much of the strings in his photos simply aren't visible due to his use of an advantageous photographic angle. However, the portions which are visi- ble, having been illuminated by the rays of the sun, just happened to have been close enough for the film to have resolved them. It doesn't really matter whether 4 inches or 4 feet of string was detected — the fact re- mains that a string (or, if you prefer, a \"supportive device\") was detected through computer enhancements. (To show that no \"cropping\" was done, copies of the original photos showing the strings have been provided for MUFON's files.) If Stevens has any hard evidence to the contrary in this matter, let him present it. (Indeed, Wendelle actually admitted to Moore before an audience in Tucson at World University, November 21, .1981 that he really didn't have any hard evidence in the Meier case, but rather chose to rely upon his own im- pression of things!) The notion, as put fourth by Stevens, that Meier shot all of his 800 or so photos \"from the hip\" (since he couldn't look through his camera) is yet another of Stevens' absurdities. It is simply an impossibility for anyone to take 800 photographs of a flying object \"from the hip\" and have the craft come out reasonably framed in every photo. In fact, just out of curiosity, Moore tried this technique with a kite and a roll of twenty ex- 8 MUFON-NORTH CAROLINA UFO CONFERENCE By Richard Hall (Photographs courtesy of Thomas P. Deuley)          • '. The sixth annual MUFON of North Carolina UFO Conference was held June 19 and 20 at the Winston-Salem Nature Science Center sponsored by the Tarheel UFO Study Group. Speakers covered the full range of UFO topics, from an apparent abduc- tion through ground and airborne close encounters, and various analyses of \"what it all means.\" Veteran UFOlogist George D.

During World War II, Covington was a flying in- (Continued on next page) posure film. He managed to get the kite in only three frames, none of which had it centered. (One wonders, in light of this, whether perhaps Meier might not have .have \"pre- exposed\" his film before ever putting it in his camera. Or for that matter, whether Stevens & Co. ever bothered to check to see if the,camera Billy claimed to be using actually worked at all? Consider the scenario of several of Billy's confederates pre-exposing the UFO-model pictures at leisure and then quietly passing the already ex- posed film to Billy, who then passes it . off as fresh film to \"the investigators.\" This accomplished, he loads his trusty camera in full view of the gullible and toodles off into the country-side on his putt-putt to shoot pictures of \"visitors from the Pleiades\" with a camera that doesn't even work! Of course, .when the pictures are developed — voila! And all with one arm too!) Wendelle's claims that \"the nearest (photographic) lab to Meier is 80 kilometers away\" doesn't seem to ring true either — especially when one realizes that Canton Zurich (where Meier lives) is only some 50 kilometers across at its widest point, and that three major cities, Zurich (430,000 pop.), Winterthur (92,500 pop.) and Schaffhausen (32,400 pop.) all lie'within 30 kilometers of the Meier farm. Statements (oft repeated verbally by Stevens, but not a part of his \"Response\") to the effect that the Meier farm is without benefit of run- ning water, electricity, or barn are all belied by photos which appear in the Pleiades book. Evidence of all three is clearly visible if one takes the time to look carefully. But getting back to the photos; the photo that Stevens says appeared in UFOs and Space but claims was \"not shown by Korff,\" does indeed appear on pages 8 and 9 of Korff's book. Also, the branches of the tree in the photo allegedly taken by Meier on March 29, 1976 near Hasenbol- Langenberg, are • indeed behind the \"UFO.\" Edge ehchancement process ; ing clearly establishes this, and it is clearly visible in Korff's book. Finally, it is our considered opinion that Wendelle Stevens' \"case\" for Bil- ly Meier is literally built of the stuff from which dreams are made, and is therefore non-existent. No matter how many \"Responses\" or rebuttals he cares to make, there simply does not appear to be any way' he can rebuild the damage he has done to his own reputation because of his in- volvement in this unfortunate affair."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"North Carolina, Continued structor at Pensacola Naval Air Sta- tion. During the Korean War he was taking a refresher course in the AU-1 (prop plane) at Cherry Point/Edonton, N.C., and was required to get in a cer- tain number of night flying hours each month. To do this, he would fly up the coast to the vicinity of New York City, circle around for a while, then return to base. On one such night flight in mid- November 1952, Covington was en route back to base from New York City and had reached a point about 15-20 miles west of Norfolk/Newport News, Va. He was at about 10,000 feet when, looking west, he spotted two \"orange dots\" at lower altitude which changed position relative to each other. They seemed to be travelling about 300 m.p.h., and pass- ed beneath him. As he turned to investigate, the ob- jects changed color, flashing pastel shades of pink, green, and blue, and finally brilliant white. His attempted pursuit was broken off when the ob- jects put on a burst of speed, estimated at 2,000 m.p.h., and left him far behind. One made a right- angle turn south and the other con- tinued east, disappearing in the distance. It was a clear night with no moon. Continuing on toward Edonton, Covington then saw in his overhead mirror a light trailing him. When he made a quick 180° turn to check it out, the object \"backed away\" with zig-zag turns and disappeared. When he again turned toward base, the ob- ject followed him. About 10 miles out he called the control tower and reported that an object was following him. The tower could see his plane and the light from an unidentified ob- ject. As Covington landed, the object stopped an estimated mile away and hovered at about 1,000 feet, starlike in appearance. He told the pilots in the ready room to go outside and take a look, but they were skeptical and responded slowly. By the time some of them went outside the object had disappeared, and Covington took some kidding about his report. Ex-Marine pilot Henry Covington Pat Eudy describes apparent abduction About three weeks later, in December, Covington was in a four- plane flight commanded by a Major Allen, flying about 25 miles south of Philadelphia. Suddenly Major Allen saw a huge orange light approaching and shouted out, \"My God, pull up!\" A huge orange disc with dome on top shot past beneath the flight. The other pilots, intent on flying close forma- tion, had not seen it approaching. The disc appeared to be about 50 feet in diameter and 15 feet thick. In 1953 Covington was stationed at K-6 base south of Seoul, Korea. Since he was scheduled for the first flight of the day, he went out to look up at the clouds. There hovering overhead was a disc-shaped orange object dark in the center, giving it an almost doughnut-like appearance. It seemed to be at about 1,000-1,500 feet.

As they stood watching, it moved away slowly to the north on a zig-zag flight pattern. Patrick M. Eudy of Monroe, N.C., a Cadillac-Oldsmobile salesman, described his apparent abduction ex- perience of March 9, 1979. Then 43, Eudy was returning home about 3:00 a.m. driving a 1979 Cutlass Supreme which had about a quarter of a tank of gas. He was on Sykesville Road in Stanley County about 18-20 miles from Monroe. As he came to a one-lane steel bridge, a brilliant light like a \"floodlight\" appeared overhead. Later Eudy \"woke up\" driving slowly down the road in a different location, dazed, his eyes burning badly. He could not account for a period of time, nor how his car got from the bridge to the new location. Next morning he felt that he had been on board a craft of some kind but had no clear recollection of it. For a few days afterwards, he had an unusual rash and itch on his fingers and ankles. He was also puzzled that the car had not used enough gas to cover the distance involved. Later he began to wake up in the middle of the night, having \"flashbacks\" — light flashes...a ,room...a chair...panels...a being. It was \"like being there again,\" he said, \"except that it was like Twilight Zone... a semi-conscious gray area.\" About July 1981 he sought help and was hypnotized by Dr. Richard Pin- neau, research psychologist. Under hypnosis, he described being in a bright room with blinding light, two seats, and panels. A being in uniform- like clothing and \"helment\" with visor took him into a dark room where he thinks tests were conducted on him. In answer to questions, Eudy said the experience \"bothers\" him and that he still has flashbacks. Why him? He feels that he was simply isolated and vulnerable, a target of opportunity, in effect. Because of the location, the lack of gasoline used, and other factors, he thinks the car was lifted off the ground with him in it and finally set down in the new location where he \"woke up.\" Dr. Richard Pinneau, who hyp- 10 notized Eudy, later spoke on setting goals for MUFON and UFOlogy. In his view, hypnotic regression is \"not of much value in providing evidence\" but can be a source of new ideas. He relates UFO experiences to psychic events, \"metaphysical\" processes, altered states of consciousness, life after life, reincarnation, and the like. He feels that it is \"essentially all beyond us.\" As positive goals, he proposed: (1) pulling together all concepts of physics, matter, etc.; (2) stop labeling of peoples' viewpoints, divisiveness; (3) increase public awareness and raise (Continued on next page) Dr. Richard Pinneau Conference Planning Committee: I. to r., Gayle McBride, Rob Ander- son, Larry Boozer, George Fawcett, Libby Cocchiarella, Ray Rhein (not shown — Bob and Mickey Hair, Jayne Ware, Erline Rhein) Panel discussion: I. to r., Richard Pinneau, Tom Deuley, Richard Hall, Wayne LaPorte, George Fawcett, Ben Haugen"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MULTIPLE WITNESS SIGHTING OF STRUCTURED UFO By Richard D.

I ran out, and a son, who was working on his car, ran too. A daughter ran out from the living room and a younger son came downstairs...\" The above narrative explains how on an evening in October of 1963, southeast of Millersport, Ohio, five individuals witnessed a UFO hover- ing perhaps 20 feet above the ground and no further away than 100 yards. Although the sighting had occurred over 19 years ago, it was very ap- parent to my wife and me that the recalling of the event still excited the witnesses. Unfortunately, Mr. Parkin- son died shortly after the sighting but the remaining witnesses were quite willing to testify to the experience.

Dr. Pinneau also stated that counseling and support for \"ab- ductees\" is far more important than grilling them for the truth. A panel discussed his ideas, review- ed crash/retrieval information, and other topics. The conference was covered by area television news and several newspapers. D 50 years old, Gary was 20, Marjorie 15, and Jeffrey was 11. Mr. Parkinson may or may not have seen the craft come down. By the time the others arrived on the scene the object was hovering above a low spot in a field, which it con- tinued to do for from 5 to 10 minutes. Glenna's (Mrs. Parkinson) description is the most detailed. She related, it was like two plates, plates or saucers together with a cup or large bowl on top and there was a tall metal anten- nae. I could tell it was metal. It seem- ed to shine. In the area where the two plates would come together there were openings, and what appeared to be flames, short flames out of these openings. This area moved. It was moving clockwise, very, very slowly. \"There were windows in the top part that would be where the bowl was turned upside down. There were windows in sets of three and they were not transparent. They were translucent...\" Glenna reported that there were rounded objects protruding from the base of the craft. \"They looked like the bottom of a ball. It looked like, just like these rollers that they have on big heavy chairs. Sort of a ball- type roller. Only, of course they were huge.\" Because of the lateness of the even- ing, colors were not distinguishable but the craft was clearly outlined by the lights of Millersport and the foot- ball field. It appeared clearly outlined by the natural light, plus lighting from the object, to the degree that moving parts could be observed. Lights from the hovering object came from two sources. The windows emitted light, \"Just like a house light only brighter. Really brighter,\" recall- ed Glenna. The flames jetting from the center section were \"...sort of yellowish-red.\" There was a slight sound coming from the object. The witnesses described it as \"very low hum,\" \"whir,\" and \"humming.\" Gary .recalled a \"swish,\" as it left the area. Most interesting, three of the witnesses testified that they saw liv- ing figures behind the windows. Mrs. Marjorie Ankeney, the married daughter, reported, 'It was really ex- citing, because it was so low you could see shadows moving around on the inside.\" Jeffrey recorded, \"There were human-like shadows moving behind the milky-clear windows.\" Glenna, once again, gave the most detailed description, \"...for a few seconds after we first saw it the form appeared. It looked like a human form. It looked exactly like a human moving like it's arms moved, like it was doing something on the counter or a controls or something in front of it. You could see the arms move out to the side and back. I could not see a face or anything like that. It just ap- peared to be a human form.\" When the object began to leave it rose slowly, made an arc to the left, and then accelerated to a tremendous speed and was gone. The witnesses speculated that had it moved away from them at a right angle, it would have appeared to disappear instan- taneously. Fortunately, it moved toward the northeast at perhaps 30° east of where it had been, so their eyes were able to follow it's trajec- tory. Gary described the speed as, \"ex- ceedingly fast.\" Marjorie used the ex- pression \"extremely fast,\" and Jeffrey reported, \"...all of a sudden it just went up and then took off faster than I have ever seen anything move. It just practically disappeared, it moved so fast.\" Again, Glenna .gave the best description, \"...then, just like (snapped her fingers) and it was gone.

What makes this sighting so in- teresting is that it is not complicated. The father calls out, the witnesses observe, and the craft leaves. There is no time lapse. They did not have a dog so, there is no animal response., No one became ill. They did not go into the field: None of the witnesses' felt fear. Their reaction was the op- posite of fear; they were elated. Jef- frey reported, \"We were all excited, hoping it would come close or land so we could get a better look at it.\" Ap- parently, after the excitement subsid- ed they continued to lead a very nor- mal life. The weather was warm, with ex- .cellent visibility and just a slight breeze. No clouds were remembered. What makes the sighting more fascinating is that the family did ex- perience nocturnal lights over a limited time of a few years and in- dividual members were, on two occa- sions, frightened by encounters.

I wrote that article in March of this year, and since that time further, investigation by the Pennsylvania Association For the Study of the Unexplained (PASU) as we)l as by other Pittsburgh-area researchers who have gone to the area of the observa- tions have now found an explanation for some of the lights that were seen near the crabapple orchard on the Simpson land. Mark Wojcik an electrical engineer, and PASU's Director of field investigations, has been to the sighting area on numerous occasions with other members to interview those involved, as well as to observe. Mark saw the lights up by the orchard and said that \"They gave the exact ap- pearance of headlights striking an area of the orchard from a great distance.\" At that time a source for the headlights couldn't be determined since the property was surrounded by a large hill of fields and woods in the back, and woods across the road which run parallel to Route 819. Traf- fic moving along Route 819 would have been the .most likely source for the headlights, but this was not found to be the case. The source of. the orchard lights were headlights from cars after all, traveling along a street over Vi-mile away from the orchard. Across the woods opposite the Simpson home, another hill rises to approximately the same elevation as the Simpson home. This hill is obscured from normal observation from the Simpson home by the woods across from Route 819. The area being lit up as found.on a topographical map proves to be in a range of 20 to 40 feet higher than the Simpson house and higher than the woods, making it possible for the car headlights from the street on the dis- tant hillside to reach the area in ques- tion. This provided a very convincing illusion of trees being lit with no possible source of light. Sightings of the lights were found to be more common after the foliage would begin to appear on the trees. The leaves on the trees seemed to add to the illumination by casting a shine from the light, and the thicker foliage created more surface area for the light to reflect from. In a recent interview I asked the Simpson's if they felt that this source would explain the many unexplained lights which they had observed . around their home. They both said \"definitely not.\" They were satisfied that some of the lights in the orchard were indeed reflections, but also felt that some of the lights they had seen in that area as well as in other sections of the property were not the same. The mystery still remains as to the bright light which appeared over the top of their home and illuminated the entire dwelling, the daylight observa- tions of bright lights which have been observed in other sections of their yard, as well as the bright illumina- tion of two large walnut trees not far from their porch. Also, the afternoon sighting of the object falling from the sky which seemed to have been the starting point to this ongoing mystery still remains unexplained. During this June and July, the sounds of the mystery animal are being heard again. Some skeptical neighbors have now heard the eerie screaming and are attempting to tape record the sound. A strange chattering sound is also being heard in the surrounding wooded area, and it has been heard in the daytime as well as at night. So even though some of the lights are now explained, there still are many aspects to the entire situation which remain baffling. We will continue to follow current incidents at this loca- tion, and hope to find some con- clusive evidence to the continuing mystery. Other recent incidents still under investigation by PASU include the following: Apollo, Pa. Incidents began after UFO sighting in 1979, still occurring in May of 1982. Several residents have reported encounters with .unex- plained hovering lights. Bigfoot-like creatures, and paranormal ex- periences. There is some indication that the appearance of the lights cor- responds with the creatures in the area.                      > Uniontown, Pa., February, 1982. Witnesses in the area have reported observing a huge UFO described as looking similar to the space shuttle or somewhat triangular, depending on the angle of observation. The object is estimated to be over 100 feet long, has wings with tiny blue lights along the wing structure and the front sec- tion of the object looks like the Con- cord. The most interesting aspect of the report was a sketch drawn for us by the initial witness who observed the craft follow along the tree line, and move over his property at an altitude of approximately 100 feet. The sketch was of an insignia he clear- ly saw on the'bottom of the object. It is an identical marking to the con- troversial UMMO incidents reported from Spain. '\" Fleetwood, Pa., Feb. 24, 1982.

North Washington, Pa. (Butler County), Apr. 1, 1982. Numerous UFO reports from many areas of Butler County during April. On April 1st, three observers watched what ap- peared to be a red pulsating star hovering over the trees about 1,000 feet away. When the headlights were turned on the jeep that was being worked on, the light source moved toward the trio. The light went over the heads of the observers at ah altitude of about 250 feet. The bright light went out, and it was still light enough outside to see the entire ob- ject. It was described as looking triangular from beneath. One witness also commented on the similarity in size and shape fo the space shuttle. It was, gun-metal gray in color and had three colored pulsating lights, one at each corner. There was a mist with a glitter effect to it, which seemed to emit from the rear of the object and encircle the entire craft. Two smaller glowing lights shot out from the main object; one went North, the other South. When a commercial jet began to approach in the distance from the East, the object rose straight up into the sky and went out of sight. The en- tire observation lasted about 45 minutes. Two of the witnesses have had severe headaches since the sighting. West Sunbury, Pa., Apr. 14, 1982.

Some hypnotists seem to find this a strange question that had never occurred to them before. More often, the hypnotist will talk about conducting a few preliminary sessions before the \"regression,\" to become convinced that the subject is reasonable and telling the truth. But even this answer does not quite get to the heart of the matter: A hypnotized subject can be well-meaning . and \"sensible-sounding\" and yet be unaware that the story being related is a product of the sub- conscious. One hypnotist I talked with put the matter in these terms: She had regressed people to find lost ob- jects, and they had remembered under hypnosis where they had lost the object. She had regressed people in therapy to get through to some traumatic event that .had happened in early childhood, and they had remembered it under hypnosis and thus overcame what was blocking their progress in therapy. So when she regressed people who had been shocked with some sort of UFO experience, and they came up with a story of being \"abducted\" onto a spaceship and having the typical adventures that \"abductees\" usually report, she • was sure that their stories were true. Regressive hypnosis works, she felt;' it worked for lost objects and therapy blocks, so surely it works for UFO \"abduc- tions\" too. But there is a key difference. In the lost object problem, hyp- notism relaxed the subject and made it possible to remember where it was lost; the fact that the object was recovered is proof of the technique. A classic case was in the bizarre kidnapping of a busload of schoolchildren in California a few years ago; under hypnosis, a witness remembered a license number, and the case was solved. In the case of the person whose therapy was at a dead end because of a repressed traumatic event that had happened at the age of perhaps 4, the \"block\" was resolv- ed and the therapy could proceed. To be sure, we don't know whether the story of the trauma developed under hypnosis was literally and objectively true, but at (Continued on next page) UFO-Bigfoot, Continued have also reported Bigfoot like creatures. Youngstown Ridge (Latrobe) Pa., May 5, 1982. Witness at approx- imately 8 p.m. observed an object the shape of a child's top with a dome shape on the top. A red pulsating light was contained within the dome area. The object appeared to be the size of a piper cub aircraft and moved slowly at an altitude of about 1,000 feet. When first observed the object was moving toward the East. It then hovered for about 30 seconds, revers- ed it's direction of travel and went over the horizon toward Greensburg. Pleasant Hills (Pittsburgh suburb). Pa., May 5, 1982. At 11:17 p.m., police radio networks in the area were filled with reports of a bright nocturnal light over the area. A pilot who heard this on his scanner, being curious, went outside in his driveway to look around. He didn't see the bright light, but saw what appeared to be a solid outline .of the front section of a triangular-shaped object moving very fast from the Northwest toward the Southwest. It was about the size of a Learjet and at the altitude of an aircraft making an approach to the air- port. What amazed the witness was the fact that he could look through the object and see the bright stars through it, as though it were transparent. Jeanette, Pa., May 19, 1982. At ap- proximately 9:10 p.m. a man was just coming in from working in his field when he noticed what he thought was a helicopter' going down on a crash course over the hill near Lincoln Heights._A massive search by State Police, fire departments, and Civil Air , Patrol units, failed to located any sign of a downed aircraft. A check with Westmoreland Control Tower as well as the FAA Flight Service office, in- dicated that there were no aircraft in the area at the time, and that all air- craft which had filed a flight plan were accounted for. A thunderstorm was just moving into the area at the time of observation. An interview with the witness indicated that the main body of the object was dark but solid appearing and was the size and shape of a corporate helicopter. What caught his attention were three separated windows that were brightly lit from within. He could not see the tail or main rotor section. The object was coming down from the sky very fast at about a 45 degree angle. The object appeared to go down behind the trees, but when it didn't reappear the witness became worried and told his friend who notified the authorities. The object had no strobe or other navigational lights. Other witnesses have now reported a similar odd shaped helicopter-type UFO which would correspond with the time of this sighting.

In the case of the UFO \"abduc- tion,\" however, there is .no recovered object and there is i no demonstration of improvement in therapy; there is nothing but an exotic, extremely unlikely story which the subject, in the intensity of the hypnotic experience, believes to be \"really true.\" The general problem here, as I see it, is that we tend to over- simplify our perception of, the world around us; we like to classify an . issue, such as hyp- notism, as being either \"good\" or \"bad,\" as \"right\" or \"wrong.\" But hypnotism offers both advantages and disadvantages. It's useful for relaxation, for helping people to reconsider and solve personal pro- blems, for helping people to recall earlier experiences. It's on this matter of recalling the past that the advantages of hypnotism begin to dissolve into disadvantages, with the picture distorted by what we would like to believe.    t People commonly view memory as a kind of storehouse from which material from years back can be recovered exactly as it happened. But psychology pro- fessor Elizabeth Loftus, who has conducted extensive research and written the excellent book Memory, finds that our memory consists of fragments that are constantly \"be- ing altered, transformed, and distorted,\" and that hypnosis tends to complicate the matter fur- ther by giving people a false con- fidence that the materials they are developing are accurate. 1 Distortion of memory through hypnosis has become recognized as sufficiently questionable in criminal cases as to constitute a breach of law; one major authority considers use of hypnosis by police on a potential witness to be \"tantamount to the destruction or fabrication of evidence.\" 2 Hypnosis seems to be useful in br- inging out material from the sub- 16 LETTERS Birth Trauma Hypothesis Editor, Robert Wanderer (No. 170, April 1982) has written a commendably lucid account of the comparatively complex and novel birth trauma (BT) hypothesis. The tentative and sometimes confused comments on the theory by others .are understandable pending availability, of the long- awaited CUFOS Proceedings. However, I would like to emphasize that the BT hypothesis is not limited to hypnotiz- ed CE-III witnesses but applies also.to the very few non-hypnosis cases in- volving conscious recall. (We have in- vestigated two conscious-recall witnesses ourselves.) Again, I hope that informed debate will focus on the issues: (l) image/event similarity among the various mental abduction analogs; and (2) testing of the BT hypothesis. •I, urge , all CE-III researchers to undertake experimental test of the BT theory. Some guidelines: • . Determine as precisely as possible the witness's birth history. Unusual birth condi- tions which could manifest themselves include the following: cesarean delivery; difficult or prolonged delivery; premature birth; breech or other abnormal positions; forceps-aided delivery; emergency procedures due to illness of mother or fetus; umbilical cord problems; amniotic sac problems; maternal psychological or physical distress or trauma; maternal dependency on drugs; drugs during delivery; fetal birthmarks; unusual birth conditions — primitive, \"natural,\" Lamazeian, etc. •. Scrutinize the witness's CE-III narrative for echoes of his/her own birth history, particular- ly unusual (and verifiable) perinatal events. conscious, particularly in helping peo- ple get a clearer idea of how they in- terpret a situation. But as a sure method to find \"objective reality,\" hypnosis is so flawed as to be not merely useless but positively dangerous. REFERENCES 1.

These are late-stage birth events which cesarean-bom witnesses could not nor- mally have experienced.

I wish to go on record as saying that I am not necessarily wedded to the BT hypothesis. If the theory is disproved or other evidence seems persuasive, fine. However, as we learn more about birth the BT/abduc- tion parallels grow stronger. For ex- ample, recent research has shown that oxytocin, the hormone which floods both mother and fetus as it initiates birth contractions, causes amnesia in laboratory animals — and doubtless in the fetus as well.* Thus most of us do have a \"missing time\" experience which we can recall later; but it is caused not by a CE-III but by central events in a normal birth.

Lawson Garden Grove, Calif. *Bohus, Bela, el «/., \"Oxytocin, Vasopressin, and Memory: Opposite Effects on Consolida- tion and Retrieval Processes,\" Brain Research, 157:414-417, 1978 (quoted in Verny, Thomas, M.D., Secret Life of the Unborn Chilli (Summit Books, New York, 1981), p. 186). More BT Hypothesis Editor, The .debate about Prof. Alvin Lawson's birth trauma (BT) hypothesis, that people claiming \"ab- duction by spacemen\" while under hypnosis really are recalling BT events (No. 172, June 1982), has taken an interesting turn. William Leet's letter to the editor properly cites conscious recollection cases and purported physical/physiological evidence as those aspects of the reports that Lawson fails to explain. It is not clear that the physical effects are validated by police or medical records — as opposed to anecdotal ac- count. If the effects are well attested, then they must be taken into account.

By Brian Parks In 1977 the genius of Steven Spielberg brought us the most positive film about extraterrestrial visitation to that date. His \"Close En- counters of the Third Kind\" was a special inspiration in the hope that non-violent contact with visiting aliens could be accomplished. With the aid of technical advisor Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Spielberg gave UFO researchers many familiar moments on the screen. Letters, Continued The core of the issue is this: Lawson's hypothesis apparently is dependent on the assumption that some startling (UFO?) event triggers the BT memories. Otherwise, why would people driving down the highway suddenly lapse into an \"altered state of consciousness\" and dredge up repressed imagery of something that happened to them at birth? There is not the slightest evidence that any known phenomenon abruptly in- duces amnesia, disorientation, and \"abduction\" reports among typical, normal motorists. 1 Given that a UFO or other startling event induced BT memories, why did it do so only selectively and not in all or most of the thousands (probably) of startling close encounter \"victims?\" What is the mechanism that causes seemingly normal people to suddenly \"flip out?\" Lawson's hypothesis is silent on these critical points. I offer an alternative hypothesis that pulls all these threads together: \"Abductees\" have had real UFO en- counters in which fetus-like humanoid beings have tampered with them in frightening ways, and their resemblance to proto-humans is what has triggered the imagery and dredged up subconscious memories. , And, perhaps, the shock to the human mind and the confused imagery (ac- cidentally or deliberately) colors the \"victim's\" recounting of the event in ways that make it difficult to deter- mine what \"really\" happened. Hal R. Aid rich College Park, Md. This year Spielberg has brought his visitors closer to home. Unlike the mysterious creatures in Close En- counters, we get a personal look at our visitor E.T., a lonely extrater- restrial botanist who had the misfor- tune of being abandoned in a strange \"alien world\": The Earth. Although E.T.'s childlike innocence is not altogether what we would expect from a visiting alien, his physical ap- pearance and other characteristics will remind UFO researchers of some im- portant CE-III cases. At least E.T.'s curiosity and fear of a strange new world is realistic. We also encounter a group of scientists who, after carefully sear- ching the spaceship landing site, con- tinue to pursue E.T. to the home of 10-year-old Elliot who has hidden him away from the outside world which threatens him.

The film is not about UFOs but is related to problems researchers have been concerned about since UFO research began. E.T. is also a delightful contrast to other alien- related films such as the current movie 'The Thing,\" and shows a welcome change in public attitude. EDITORIAL NOTES Due to an unanticipated change of printers, which will begin with the August issue (now in preparation), some articles and features were drop- ped from this issue. They will appear in the next two issues. Forthcoming articles include coverage of the 1982 MUFON UFO Symposium, possible reptilian origins of some UFO oc- cupants, strange sightings in Washington State, an update of the disappearance of Australian pilot Frederick Valentich, and a \"re-review\" of Dr..Harley Rutledge's book. The Chinese Journal of UFO Research has gathered 600 cases of UFO sightings in China that it hopes to have translated into English and of- fered for sale. To make the publica- tion project feasible, the editors need to know how many readers are potentially interested in purchasing the report; the more who subscribe, the cheaper the volume will be to each person. The volume will contain an estimated 60,000-120,000 words, since the cases each will be described in 100-200 words. To express your interest, or for fur- ther information, write to Paul Dong, P.O.

Leo Sprinkle and Jiles Hamilton (a Florida hypnotist) as saying that friendly beings from other worlds are using human \"transmitters\" to send messages to Earth. Both researchers claim to have had \"alien voices\" speak through hypnotized subjects. An Iowa nurse claims to have been ab- ducted by extraterrestrial beings on four occasions, the' first time at 8 years of age, according to a report in the ENQUIRER'S June 22 issue. The \"Anti-Matter/UFO Update\" segment of July OMNI tells of at- torney Peter Gersten's efforts to ob- tain classified UFO files from the CIA and other governmental agencies. There is also a short feature on the UFO Contact Center in Seattle, Washington, which specializes in the investigation of contact and abduc- tion claims. The newsstands are bare these days, so far as UFO magazines are concerned. No one misses the fiction from the Pass brothers' SJ. Publica- tions, but it would appear that UFO REPORT has also gone down the drain. If so, this is unfortunate, as UFO REPORT was the only semi- reliable publication of its type in re : cent times. The continent of Africa has produc- ed its share of fascinating UFO reports through the years and an ex- cellent compendium of such cases is now available in a nicely-produced paperback, UFOs-AFRICAN EN- COUNTERS. The author, Cynthia Hind, will\" be • known to many MUFON members, as she has attend- ed two MUFON Symposiums in re- cent years and her articles have ap- peared in this Journal, as well as in FATE and other U.S. magazines. She has traveled extensively in Zimbabwe (where she lives) and generally in South Africa, investigating UFO reports and interviewing witnesses. Her personal comments and evalua- tions of cases make this book more than just another collection of sightings. She includes information on several close-range observations of UFQs, including landing traces and occupant sightings. The contact story of Elizabeth Klarer is examined, as well as another long-running case involving radio contact with beings who claim to be extraterrestrials. The book is well il- lustrated with photographs and draw- ings, plus a bibliography and index. It is available for $5.95 (plus 85c postage & handling) from the American distributor, Arcturus Book Service (263 N. Ballston Avenue, Scotia, NY 12302). If you were intrigued by the theme of George H. Leonard's book, SOMEBODY ELSE IS ON THE MOON, but were not convinced by the NASA photographs reproduced in the book, here is another one you might want to check out. Fred Steckl- ing was an associate of the late con- troversial contactee, George Adam- ski, so there will be \"scientific resear- chers\" who will reject the book for that reason alone. Big mistake! It is not what Steckling says, but rather the photographs which make this book of interest. All photos are from the Apollo missions or Lunar Orbiters (with a few exceptions) and all are available for public inspection. Ap- parently, very few people ever bother to inspect them. Steckling's personal interpretations of lunar features are open to debate, but if these photos have not been retouched (and the author says they have not), it is difficult to see how some of these formations could be anything but ar- tificial. The title is WE DISCOVERED ALIEN BASES ON THE MOON, available from the author (P.O. Box 1722, - Vista, CA 92083) for $9.95. The latest book from Wendelle C. Stevens is UFO CONTACT FROM UNDERSEA, written with Dr. Virgilio Sanchez-Ocejo, a Florida at- torney. It deals largely with the alleg- ed abduction experiences of Filiberto Cardenas, who claims to have been taken aboard an alien craft on two oc- casions in 1979, once accompanied by his wife. During hypnotic regression sessions he told of being taken to an underwater base of the extrater- restrials. Stevens supplements the Cardenas story with an account from a Baptist minister in Puerto Rico, who claims to have been taken to a very similar type of • undersea installation by another group of aliens^ Additional reports of UFOs seen entering^and leaving bodies of water are included. The book is nicely produced, with numerous photos, drawings and maps. There are some typographical errors, but none which seriously af- fect the substance of the narratives. A very interesting survey of some highly intriguing cases. Copies are $14.95 (plus $1.25 postage & handl- ing) from UNDERSEA, P.O. Box 17206, Tucson, AZ 85731-7206. NEWS, Millerton, NT April 1, 1982 At least two local residents reported sighting unidentified flying objects (UFO) over the general arealast week. Charles \"Bud\" Hoffman, employed at a surgical instrument plant in Canaan, said he stepped outside a building at 1:30 a.m. Thursday morning and said his vision was attracted to a very large blue and white light, moving easterly at a fast rate of speed. He described the object as flying at a very low altitude, which necessitated it to climb sharply to clear nearby mountains. What ap- peared, to be orange exhaust flames, he said, could be seen after it passed but no sound was heard. Another Millerton resident.
