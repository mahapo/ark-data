Allen Hynek, known for his cautious approach, their story is for real. It all began around 7 o'clock, Thursday night, Oct. 11 when Charles Hickson, 42, and Calvin Parker, 18, Pascagoula, Mississippi, shipyard workers, were fishing from an old pier in the Pascagoula River. \"All of a sudden we heard something like a buzzing sound,\" Hickson said on a brief, filmed interview on Biloxi WLOX TV, \"and what I saw looked like a bright, flashing blue light. It looked bluish to me. All of a sudden it seemed to stop.\" He said it appeared to be hovering a few feet over the ground and \"one end just opened, and I saw three things coming out. They seemed to be floating across the water a couple of feet high. \"Before I knew it, they were on me and two of them had me by each arm and immediately I was lifted from the ground. I was quite scared It's hard to recall exactly what did happen.\" He said he was carried to the \"vehicle\" where he was examined by \"some kind of instrument. . it reminded me of a big eye\" which \"covered my entire body.\" He said he was not harmed and \"didn't have any sensation whatso- ever. I was just helpless.\" Parker said he was taken to the craft too, but passed out from fright shortly after the creatures appeared and could not remember what happened afterward. Both men admitted to authorities they took \"a stiff drink\" after they were released but said they had not been drinking before. Chief .Deputy Barney Mathis said they definitely were not intoxicated. Sheriff Fred Diamond is sure something did happen tothem. \"These are reliable people,\" Diamond said. Diamond said the space craft was described as fish-shaped, about 10 feet square with an eight foot ceiling. The occupants were said to have pale silvery-gray skin with no hair, long pointed ears and noses, with an opening for a mouth, and hands like crab claws. On NBC national television, Oct. 15, Hickson said the faces of the creatures \"seemed to come to a point\" and he didn't see any eyes. They had \"round things\" on the ends of their legs, but no toes. The only sound he could hear was a humming or buzzing sound from one of the creatures.  . Dr. James Harder, of the University of California, also appeared on the televised interview and indicated his belief the men had ex- perienced a terrifying experience. Neither man suffered any apparent injuries but they were taken Friday to a military hospital at nearby Keesler Air Force Base to be checked for possible radiation exposure as a precaution. Keesler off- icials said an examination by Air Force physicians found no evidence of radiation. \"The Tulsa Tribune,\" Tulsa, Okla., carried a UPI report out of Pascagoula, Monday, Oct. 15, and quotes Dr. Hynek as saying the experience of the two men indicates that a strange craft from another planet did land in Mississippi. \"Where they are coming from and why they were here is a matter of conjecture,\" Dr. Hynek said, \"but the fact that they were here on"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"this planet is beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Hynek and Dr. James Harder of the University of California inter- viewed by hypnosis the two men. Hynek, who was scientific consultant of Project Bluebook when it was conducted on UFOs by the U. S. Air Force in 1960's, said after talking to Parker and Hickson: \"There is no question in my mind that these men have had a very terrifying experience. Under no circumstances should they be ridiculed. Let's protect .these men.\" Hynek said although the men were able to be hypnotized \"there ex- perience was so traumatic that it was essential to progress slowly.\" \"There are not imbalanced people,\" Harder said. \"They're not crackpots.\" \"There was definitely something here that was not terrestrial of the earth,\" he said* Paul Cerny, MUFON State Director for Northern California, writes Dr. Harder was on radio station KGO in California for more than hour, talking about the case, the night of Oct. 15. Mr. Cerny also appeared on the program (and gave MUFON a plug!). 'And this was not the only UFO report from Mississippi. Thomas E. Westmoreland, a National Park Service ranger at Tupelo, said he saw a large, unidentified flying object hovering for 15 minutes north of Tupelo Wednesday night, Oct. 3. \"I know this sounds strange, and ,1 can assure you I'm sober,\" Westmoreland said. \"It was approximately 1,000 feet in altitude and roughly the size of a two-bedroom house or a little smaller. \"It had red, green and yellow, flashing lights—not the standard beacon type you have on an aircraft,\" he said. \"They were circular and they were rotating continuously.\" Three other rangers and a deputy sheriff were with him when he saw the strange craft.   . Westmoreland doesn't call it a UFO. \"Our theory is that it's some highly secret experimental aircraft the Air Force is trying out and doesn't want the public to know about,\" he said. Other reports came in from the Tupelo area, although radio stations from Corinth, 50 miles to the north, and Koscuisko, 100 miles to the south, said they were swamped with calls from persons who said they had sighted UFOs. : Arlin Mohundro, sales manager for radio station WKCU in Corinth, said the object he saw hovered about 100 feet off the ground behind the station. \"Its lights are red and green and white,\" he said. \"When it gets close, it has kind of a black color. The lights are flashing and it looks like it might be the size of an automobile, but it's in an oval shape.\" (\"Illinois State Register,\" Springfield) Well, Ranger Westmoreland is certainly right on one poirit--the origin of these strange flying objects is still \"highly secret.\" To All of Our Staff and Subscribers; We want to get back to our policy of listing each contributor—but so many newspaper clippings and other reports came in this month, it would take a page just to list the names of all you nice folks.

Oct. 10 edition of \"The Sedalia Capital.' 1 \"The literature of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) is filled with some pretty unbelievable stuff, but probably not much of it exceeds in strangeness the experience last week of a Cape Girar- deau, Mo., truck driver, Eddie D. Webb told authorities he was temporarily blinded by a \"ball of fire\" from a UFO that came up behind his truck on 1-55 near Jackson. Webb said the UFO was turnip-shaped, with the top and bottom spinning, and gave off red and yellow lights. Webb's molten glasses were examined by a physicist at Southeast Missouri State University, who said the frames appeared to have been heated internally. Dr. Harley Rutledge said he saw no evi- dence of a hoax. The incident is the latest in a series of UFO sightings in Mis- souri, primarily in the southern part of the state. The U. S. Air Force, which for years financed a continuing study of UFOs, has written off most \"sightings\" as explainable pheno- mena. But some remain unexplained. Eddie Webb's experience seems to fit the latter category.\" Eddie Webb, 45, of Greenville, a driver, for Sam Tanksley,Trucking, Inc., of Cape Girardeau, encountered the UFO while he was driving a tractor-trailer rig on Interstate 55 just south of the Jackson exit at Wedekind Park about 6:15 or 6:30 Wednesday morning, Oct. 3. .'. Webb saw a bright object approaching \"real fast\" in the air behind him. He described it as being turnip shaped and said it appeared to have three sections—the top and bottom made of aluminum and spinning while the center section was steady and comprised of glittering red and yellow lights. The large object covered both lanes of the road. He awoke his wife, who was sleeping in the cab, but she didn't see anything out of her rear view mirror. Webb then stuck his head out the window to look behind and seconds later was blinded by a bright flash which felt like a large ball of fire which struck him about the head and face. His glasses fell off and he couldn't see. But he got the truck stopped. Mrs. Webb said her husband screamed,\"Oh, my GodI I'm burned! I can't seel\" One of the lenses of his glasses fell out of the plastic frame which was warped. Mrs. Webb, who serves as a relief driver at times, drove to the Southeast Missouri Hospital. Sgt. Ed Wright of the Highway Patrol took Webb's glasses to Dr. Harley Rutledge, head of the Southwest Missouri State University physics department, for an analysis. Rutledge, who has been been working on UFO sightings at Piedmont, Mo., said he put the glasses under a microscope and \"it appeared; they were heated internally. The plastic apparently got hot and the mold came to the surface. The heat warped the plastic, causing the lens to fall out.\" In an interview with the press several days later, Rutledge said he produced similar results in a laboratory by passing a highway flare back and forth over the glasses. The flare was used, he"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"said, after other truck drivers reported seeing a flare on the highway at about the same time and place, Webb said he was injured, \"The test didn't prove that his story isn't true,\" said the physicist. \"It could have been anything from a flare to a spaceship.\" \"One thing which seems to substantiate Mr. Webb's story is that whatever struck his glasses did not come from directly ahead-, but from slightly to the left,\" Di>,iI?Wlnfigp^Taid. \"This is what you would expect from a person lookip^to the rear frbm a truck window.\" Temporarily blinded, Jirebb's vision began returning:and he could see with blurred vision for about three feet. He w^p treated by an ophtha- mologist who found nflTdamage to his eyes. On Mbnday he went to the Barnes Hospital in ft. Louis for further examination. - Asked by the pr/ss about what he had seen, Webb said: \"I don't know what it was. ^People want me to say it was a\\flying saucer, but I can't say that. f/lii'fT'Tniii'i 111 I MM T ill Hip M ijlil people that saw those things wera crazy. Now everyone tningss^jm cracking up, but by God I saw something and it blinded me.\" He was interviewed by a staff writer from \"Thfe Southeast Missourian at his home. He wore sunglasses and seemed exhausted and shaken by his experience. Hj^s,, forehead appeared slightgy red, as if it had received a mild sShbur 1 !!, and \"H'e couiplUlii«d-4*equently of pain which went deep inside n\\s forehead and eyes. He /bill flinched at bright lights. Giving more details on the encounter, bfe said when he first saw the lights behind himVthey appeared to b/ about a mile away, but approached rapidly. He^ras driving abou/ 55-60 miles per hour. He said the object appeareoL to be about 3p feet in diameter as it came up behind his rig, and wae four or fi#e feet above the ground; and he thought the object mustNhave beejr at least ten feet high. When he stuck his head ou'bs s ofJ&ifie window, \"I saw something which looked like a light from a spoVaraght come down on the tandem of the trailer and at the same time the object started to rise higher in the air.\" Up to this time he had heard no motor noise, but as the object started to rise, he heard a \"humming\" sound which seemed to rise in frequency as the lights rose higher. \"I stuck my head out a little farther, looked back and a bright white flash, like a ball of fire, hit me in the face. When the light flashed, everything stopped—the noise arid all—and the lights went out.\" He put on the brakes and stopped in the middle of the road and screamed that he could not see. Mrs. Webb turned on a light in the truck and looked at her husband to find his forehead red and hot as if it had been blistered. One lens, had fallen out of his glasses and the frame was melted arid twisted. The sketch Webb drew of the object has been copied on this page. A policeman thought the flash might have been gas formed by the load of plastic in the trailer. But when the trailer was checked, there was no damage to the cargo or the truck, authorities said. On Oct. 9 the Missourian reported that Dr. C. E. Windsor, Mr. Webb's opthamologist in the St. Louis hospital said he doubts Mr. Webb's temporary blindness was caused by the heat and light from a flare and is checking the theory the man was \"scared into blindness.\" Dr. Windsor found no evidence of damage to the eyes and is now testing to see if his partial blindness is pathological or a form of psychic shock.  • - \"I think something definitely happened to this man,\" he said."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"UFOs In California Too Sandra Acosta, who writes a column \"Sandra's Ramblings\" for \"The Big Bear News,\" Big Bear Lake, California, devoted her column on Sept. 20 to UFOs—and with good reason too. Mrs. Acosta and other members of her family saw UFOs. \"About two Sundays ago,\" she wrote, she looked out the window about 11 p.m. and saw a multi-colored object in the air hovering in the vic- inity of Big Bear City. She thought at first it was a plane, but as it remained stationary for a half hour, .she changed her mind. Then, suddenly \"the lights got brighter and blink! The lighted object shot at terrific speed toward the north and disappeared from my view. Our oldest daughter, Cristina saw the same thing. We decided it was too weird and uncertain to even discuss so we promptly put it out of our minds.\" But on Sunday night, Sept. 16 at 10:45 Cristina, who was tired of hearing the erratic barking of a coyote, opened a window to yell at it. Instead she yelled, \"Look, everyone that thing is back!\" The three girls and Mrs. Acosta looked out of the window to the east—and closer than before and lower was the hovering object of many colors with red being the brightest. \"It hovered about another minute then made a slow movement in our direction seemingly about a hundred or so feet above the trees. As it went over toward the north side of our house, we all saw the same thing—glowing red and a disc shape. It veered a little to the north then went in a straight path toward Snow Summit to the west, picking up speed and disappeared.\" Commenting on her reaction, Mrs. Acosta wrote:\"It's a rather un- usual feeling to observe one of these objects because as you're watch- ing it you can hardly believe you are seeing what you are seeing. If I hadn't had other people see the same thing, I would have kept my ex- perience to myself, figuring it r must have been something I ate' rather than an experience that baffles the mind.\" And this wasn't the end of it. On Tuesday night, Sept. 25, Mrs. Acosta called Jory Sherman, another writer for the \"Big Bear News\" to tell him a luminous object was flying in his direction, that is, from east to west. Sherman and his son, David, went outside at approximately 7:20 with a pair of 7x50 binoculars. \"At first we saw nothing,\" he wrote. \"Then through the trees above Pine Summit, we saw a bright gold object, a globe-shaped beacon, moving toward open sky.\" He quickly called his family outside and the five watched the object. \"The magnitude was greater than any star or light we had ever seen. It shone brilliantly as it moved methodically at an undetermined speed across the night sky. I put the binoculars on it and the shape flattened out, elongated, still glowing. There was an unmistakable conning tower centered on the object. I watched it for several seconds when it sudden- ly picked up speed and sped out of sight, toward Cedar Lake. I raced to an open spot a few yards away, but the object was gone,\" Sherman wrote. He said there were two other aircraft -visible on. the same course and were easily recognizable as such. The object was not Skylab, for they had seen it travel the opposite direction earlier. Sherman reported this sighting and others to Mrs. Idabel Epperson, MUFON's State Director for Southern California, and during the next few days Kr. Sherman and Mrs. Acosta were interviewed by field inves- tigators, scientists, government agency representatives who wish not to be identified, and others. 7"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"On Monday Adrian Vance , a photography, expert and MUFON consultant, came up to the Big Bear area and camped above Goldmine Ski-Resort. On Tuesday he reported to Sherman that he had seen a UFO and photo- graphed it, .but felt it might have been too far away for a good .picture. On Tuesday, Hilly Rose's office at KFI radio in Los Angeles called: and asked Sherman and Mrs. Acosta to appear on their program Oct. 4th.\" Stanton Friedman, nuclear physicist and lecturer, also expressed interest in the sightings and stated his plans for visiting the area. These sightings were the subject of an article by Robert B. Klinn and David Branch -in the Oct. 3 Santa Ana \"Register\"; and, in addition to the facts given here, he reports Mrs. Acosta and her family and a couple guests saw another UFO \"very bright, very fast, -very close. It was lower, however, and we lost sight of it very quickly.\" Mrs. Ascota also reports that her eldest daughter develops^ a^ nose- bleed every time a UFO comes in close range, and she described her own .sensitivity to pressure changes on her eardrums when a UFO' comes- near. Reporter .Sherman also disclosed that his barometer has been fluctuating abnormally. The article concludes \"The scientists visiting Big-Bear are not laughing and are considering the possible use at Big Bear of highly .accurate instruments to measure changes in barometric pressure.\" Editor's Note: We also have reports from northern California from .

Every branch of the news media is reporting UFO sightings and the tongue-in-cheek style of writing has almost disappear- ed—which results in more people being willing to report unidentified flying objects as they no longer fear public ridicule. Hundreds of people have called local, state and federal authorities to report sightings in the past several weeks, and more news clips are coming in daily. Some of tne objects seen have been easily identified as stars, balloons etc and investigation has proved some to be hoaxes as is always the case when a \"flap\" gets underway; but many remain un- identified. The \"Sun-Democrat,\" of Faducah, Ky., points out that \"Critics of UFO reports might also take note that the strange phenomena in the sky has been sighted by some very reliable people , including Obion County, Tenn. Sheriff Nathan Cunningham.\" Sheriff Cunningham spotted three UFOs Saturday night, Sept. 29, one of which.raced over his house glowing and humming, and he talked to at least 20 callers who reported similar sightings. \"I saw something and I don't know what it was,\" .Cunningham said. \"It had a big, bright light in the center and it had red, green and blue locking lights around it. You couldn't tell how far away it was or how big it was. From a distance it looked like the big glow was 10 or 12 feet square.\" He said he sav; two UFOs hover over a Hornbeak riding ring, then dis- appear early Saturday evening. When he arrived home later., his phone, was ringing constantly. As he looked outside a third UFO passed by. \"It was low enough that I, could hear this one,\" he said. \"It made a humming sound th^t didn't sound like a plane or a helicopter.\" The \"Memphis Fress-Scimitar\" reported Sept. 24 that Shelby County police and sheriffs' deputies were busy examining overnight reports of a UFO. The first sighting was reported to the Sheriff's Department at 8:41 p.m. Sunday night by an unnamed citizen who said \"something\" was hovering near the Tennessee Highway Patrol office at 6348 Highway 70. Deputies F. L. Pilalas and J. 0. Davis checked the report and radio- ed the dispatcher that they, too, had spotted the object, described as -about 50 feet in diameter with four red lights and a running light. Filalas judged the craft's altitude to be from 500 to 1000 feet. He flashed his flashlight on the vehicle as he hung out of the window, looking upward. Then \"We let our blue light shine twice and then stop- ped. The vehicle then flashed its white beams twice and then both the white lights and the red lights went out. It just disappeared. It made a whirring-type noise for about 30 seconds to a minute. Then it was gone.\" Their sighting was preceded by a two-minute unexplained blackout of one of their radio frequencies. On checking, they learned no helicopters were in the area. Filalas said he didn't know of any aircraft that hovers besides a helicopter \"and I know what a helicopter sounds like.\" Trooper B. G. Arnold of the Highway P'atrol and five other patrolmen reported seeing the UFO and calls continued to come in from East Memphis until about 11 p.m. when police were notified the UFO was spotted in Frayser. Tommy Robbins, an Illinois Central-Gulf Railroad employe, said he"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"spotted a bright, 1 hovering object with red and white lights from his carport in Jackson, Tenn.

It moved to the west very slowly,\" he said. \"Then it disappeared.\" (The Tennessean, Sept. 25, 1973) In Obiob County at the Kentucky border in northwest Tennessee, George and Vici Rogers said a bright red light swooped close enough to the earth to light up an acre and a half of land, Saturday night, Sept. 29, nearly causing a seven car pileup on State Highway 7$ near Reelfoot Lake. ••-••••• \"I just glanced over to my left in a field and there was a six or seven foot bright red light. It was so bright, I couldn't see. It lit up an acre and a half of land. Then the light went out and we couldn't see anything. There were seven or eight cars on the road and they almost hit each other. I was pretty scared.\" \"It. was about as high as the utility lines or maybe over them,\" Mrs. Rogers said. . . it scared me pretty bad.\" Policeman Planning Glover of Collerville, Tenn., saw the UFO. \"If ,.I was by myself, I'd say I was nuts, but there were plenty of witnesses,\" he said. Glover said the moving light appeared orange at 'times, then changed back to white. \"We put a spotlight on it and it just went out,\" 'he said, \"then it reappeared in a different place.\" , \"We called a helicopter out and he'seemed to be right over it, but as far as I know, he must not have seen it.\" Faducah,•Kentuck/Police Chief Robert Holt said his patrolmen sighted some \"strange phenomena\" in the sky Sunday night (S-ept. 30). \"Strange glows\" and\"wierd looking fire in the sky\" he attributed to a power : failure when a car struck a utility pole and a transformer was knocked to the ground and sparks discharged. He had no explanation for sight- ings in other areas. On October 5> the \"Commercial Appeal,\" Memphis, carried nearly a page review, of the UFO sightings, stressing the fact there is no official reporting center. Here's an example of one man's experience when he tried to 'report a sighting. \"The FAA said they don't' have anything- to do with it. The FBI said to call the police or the Air Force; the Air Force'said they were referring all their calls to the Civil Defense and the Civil Defense said they were taking reports arid filing them and that I should call the police. The police referred me to the Civil De- fense.\" He finally.made his report to the newspaper. ' . Also, on Oct. 5th an AP report out of Union City, Tenn. stated two railroad workers found three helium-filled balloons, tied together in a package that included a tinfoil tail, and this, no doubt, accounted for some of the sightings reported earlier. UFOs were reported in the Charleston, S. C., area too. Red, white and blue lights were seen on an object in the Folly Beach area Sept. 2$ as the UFO'moved silently to the north.Similar sightings had been reported in the same area on Wednesday, Sept. 26. In Charleston an Alice Drive man told county police that he saw two objects in the sky about 11:45 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 2?. He said that the objects appeared to be stationary and were in the shape of \"half an egg shell\" with red, white and blue lights.. A Cartwright Drive man said, that he saw a star-shaped object, with flashirig red, white, blue and. green lights about 9:30 the same evening. The man said the object was close at first, then moved to the north. (Charleston Evening; Post) Fletcher W. Ross, a photographer for the -Greenville Nev-/s, was among an estimated 100 persons who reported seeing the object which reported- ly had flashing red and white lights (Sept,. 26). \"It was a long way off, miles off,\" said Koss. \"It was impossible to see any. design from 1 10"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"that distance.\" A National Weather Service spokesman said he believed the object was the planet Venus.  , • ' Charleston County police said there were \"sightings of unidenti- fied flying objects in the area Thursday (Sept.\" 27). A Pickett Street man told police he saw a UFO over SoL Legare Road. A Sevons Street man also reported seeing an object in the sky around 7:40 p.m. (\"The News and Courier,\" Sept. 28) In Alabama, the \"riuntsville Times\" on Sept. 23, reported a wave of' telephone calls had been received from citizens who reported seeing UFOs. Sent to investigate an east Montgomery housing development where several UFOs were reportedly seen Wednesday night (Sept. 19), policemen told of seeing one bright white light and another object that changed colors from white to green to red. At nearby Maxwell Air Force Base, radar experts said screens showed no unusual objects.  \" On Thursday, Mrs. Charles Rogers, of Montgomery, said she and some neighbors saw three very bright objects darting around the sky, moving \"up and down and back and forth.\" Officer Keith Broach, of Auburn, Ala., said he saw something the size of an airplane which appeared red and white changed to green and then-to white before flying away. A policeman at Lanett, Ala., said he saw an object about the size of a car, coming to within 150 feet of the ground. There also were sight- ings reported by police in Carrville, Notasulga and Tuskegee, Ala. (Indianapolis Star. Sept. 10) Several persons reported UFOs in .the Noitiwest Arkansas skies Sept. 26. Jonesboro police said they had reports of orange and brown.colored balls in the sky. Another report came in of a \"big white ball\" in the sky northeast of Jonesboro.  . State Police also reported that officers at Trumann received a re- port of an object which appeared to be changing colors from white to red to green. Other reports of balls of fire were received from Rector, Corning and Sterling Springs (\"The Arkansas Gazette,\" Sept-. 27) - \"The L/aily Dunklin Democrat,\" of Kermett,Mo., had'more reports from Arkansas on Sept. 28. A spokesman for the State Police at Jonesboro estimated at least three dozen calls.were handled by.state police and city police, with callers reporting \"cigar-shaped objects\" with flash- ing lights.      '.-''. \"Most of the reports which came in said the lights on the craft change from green to red to white. Some even say tuey can see spotlights on the crafts directed at the ground,\" a state police dispatcher reported. The flying objects reportedly hover close to the ground, drop suddenly, then take off with a fantastic speed, according to the callers. Calls also came in from Blythesville. Two Greene County families reported seeing a brightly-lit \"silver colored\" UFO hover over the home of County Civil Defense Director Charles Cozart for a few minutes the night of Oct. 1. And, on the Harrison Branch Farm immediately east of the Cozart home six miles south of Paragould (Ark.) on Highway 1, grass and weeds near a thicket at the edge of a soybean field appears to have\" been matted down by an object, or objects in a 10-by20 foot area.   . \"The Paragould Daily Press\" had a picture of flattened area in their Oct. 2 edition. Judy Cozart, 15, and Sherry Azbill, 17, were returning home after a school play practice about 10 p.m. when they saw a very bright object hovering about 200 feet over the Cozart home. They ran into Sherry's home (Mr. and Mrs. Lynian Azbill) calling for Mr. Azbill to come see what was happening. Judy was on the phone call- 11"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"ing her parents (gust across the highway) to report the UFO. Azbill picked up his binoculars and went outside to get a better look at the object, which, by that time, had begun to speed away in a northeasterly direction toward Paragould. He said by the time he saw th,e object, it was about a quarter-mile from him and gaining altitude. He said he watched it travel north for a few minutes be- fore it came to a standstill in the sky. After a moment or two, he lost sight of it,  • \"I couldn't say it was a round, or revolving object. It was very bright and had a red light that was brighter than the red light on the KHIG radio tower. It had a couple of green lights on it too, but the red light seemed to be the most proml ent color,\" he said. An Air Force veteran, Azbill was positive the object was not an airplane or a balloon. Cozart and hiw wife went outside their house immediately after being told of the UFO by their daughter. He said he got a \"bird's eye view\" of the object as it was speeding toward Paragould. \"It was so bright, I couldn't tell what kind of shape it was.\" The next.morning Mrs. Cozart told her husband she was awakened some- time during the night by a \"clicking noise.\" She saw colored lights flashing through the bedroom windows. The noise and the limits ceased and she went back to sleep without looking out the windows. A UFO that resulted in many calls to police in two northwest Arkansas counties the night of Oct. 3 turned out to be only a star flashing through a high altitude cloud formation, according to a report in the Oct. 4 \"Northwest Arkansas Times,\" of Fayette. On Mday, Oct. 5, Orris Collins captured a \"UFO\" on his farm about six miles west of Paragould. The object consisted of two balloons tied to a package which held a small battery and a bulb and a piece of alum- inum foil. The balloons, about the size of basketballs, were filled with helium. Police in Eaton, Indiana, said they tracked a strange flying object with flashing red, white and blue lights for several hours Tuesday night, Oct. 9. Military radar at nearby Baer Field picked up the ob- ject, 'but officers were unable to contact the craft or determine what it was. Police said 750 persons spotted the UFO and calls came in from 15 different areas. v (Kirksville, Mo. \"Daily Express\") On the same night a UFO with red and green lights whirling atop, hovered over Southeast Louisiana for two hours. Dennis Gros, managing Editor of the Slidell Laily Times, said he tracked down the flashing object after receiving vails from residents. \"I would like to think there is some logical, eartly explanation for whatever it was,\"he said, \"But\" we did watch something.\" Observers who had seen Skylab were sure this object was not the same. (\"The Cincinnati Enquirer,\" Oct. 11,1973) Back in Tennessee-, Jov Smith, 13, and his brother Barry, 9, of v Chester County, hid in a chicken house when they spotted \"something green\" 1 with red lights\" whizzing over their heads and then told their mother they were \"scared it was £;oing to get them.\" (\"Arkansas Gazette,\" Oct.4) Moving to Ohio, a bright UFO was photographed over Dayton, Ohio, and was shown on the NBC television news Monday night, Oct. 15th. The photographer was quoted as saying a slight humming noise was heard from the object. Millions tv'f TV viewers must have been awed, as was Ye Ed, in seeing the bright, white circle of brilliant light appear in the middle of the screer,, then dart away with the speed of lightning into the black sky. Sightings of a UFO were reported from noth of Dayton to as far south as Cincinnati, the ni : ;ht of Oct. 10. New Lebanon policeman Robert Bales snapped a picture of a UFO in view for at least 30 minutes. 12"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Bales said he and about 25 New Lebanon residents gathered on Holder- man St. to observe the antics of the UFO shortly after 8 p.m. He de- scribed the object as a set of about four bright lights that fused together at the base. He said the object shot straight up in the air, moved across the skyline and finally came to treetop level and just disappeared. About the same time he and the others were watching the UFO, a Montgomery county Sheriff's Deputy, Ed Stoner, was cruising on Dia- mond Mill Rd. and radioed that he also had the object in view. At daybreak, Oct. 11, a woman said she had spotted a multi-lighted object in the 'sky along U.S. 35 around Woodman Drive. She said it was shaped like two plates. The Ohio State Highway patrol dispatched a car to the scene when it was reported that about 50 motorists had pulled off the expressway to watch the phenomenon. The officer reported back, however, that he didn't see anything by the time he arrived. (\"The Journal Herald,\" Dayton, Ohio) On Monday, Oct. 1, Mrs. Barbara Marquardt, of Cleveland, Ohio, reported a glowing green ball in the sky and said she saw it land in .a field in suburban Olmsted Township. She spotted the object at 3:30 a.m. and said it traveled over her car and descended on a curve to the surface of the field. \"We couldn't locate anything back there,\" said Police Chief Rich- ard Masielle, who led the search for the object. \"But it's a large field. . several people did hear some strange eerie noises. They never heard anything like it before. It did upset the animals. One horse even ran off.\" Several others reported seeing the green ball that was \"real bright.\" (Kirksville \"Express & News,\" Oct. 2.) Monday night, Oct. 1, Special officer Z. T. Jackson, of Sikeston, Mo., was driving north on Ingram Road about 9 p.m. to investigate a UFO report. Near the intersection with Tanner Road, Jackson said a large, bright, red ball shot up into the sky from a soybean field and disappeared. He estimated the size of the object at 50 to 100 feet in diameter. He saw the object above the ground but did not see it land. A search of the field the next day showed no evidence of a landing.  ' • - '. : That night between 15 and 20 law enforcement officers from the Sikeston area observed three objects playing leapfrog in the sky. A Cape Girardeau man said he saw a bright strobe-like light moving at right angles .in a stairstep pattern while driving his car on Bend Road near Bertling at 7:30 Tuesday night, Oct. 2. He said the light was a little bigger and brighter than a star and was alternating red and white in a strobe effct. He was able to observe it for 10 to 15 seconds before it disappeared in the tree line. (\"Cape Girardeau Southeast Missourian,\" Oct. 4) At Wyatt, Mo. a flying object was quickly identified. Bud Hartley, a farmer, saw a strange object bouncing across his bean field Sunday and chased it down. It was six small helium-filled balloons tied to- gether with string and dangling a small flashlight with the switch in the \"on\" position. '(St. Louis, Mo. \"Post-Dispatch\", Oct. 10) On Oct. 3 a truck driver was temporarily blinded by a light shot from a UFO, near Cape Girardeau, Mo.

This is under investigation and we expect -to have more on the case next month. At Palmyra, Mo., six high school students, all of accountable age and reputation, reported a sighting on the night of Sept. 22. Corbyn Jacobs, Palmyra postmaster and MUFON representative, taped interviews and sent them to Walter H. Andrus, MUFON Director at Quincy, 111. The Quincy \"Herald-Whig\" printed an account Sept. 30. The reports indicated the presence of a lighted craft just south . of Quincy Lock and Dam 21 and the Northeast Missouri Power cooperative installation. The students said the craft was of small to medium size with an extremely bright light, rectangular in shape, and almost noise- less except for an electric-like hum which took it almost straight up when a river barge moving upstream on the Mississippi shone a search light on the hovering craft. When the light was shone on the craft, it brought forth its own light, said to be unbelie-vably brilliant, then promptly rose very rapidly. What is believed to be the same object was seen again Wednesday ni£>it, Sept. 26, between midnight and 12:10 a.m. at Hannibal, Mo., by throe policemen in a squad car. They used their lights, as the river captain did, and got the same response. . Sheriff's officers trailed a UFO from the edge of Quincy, 111., to Baldwin Field before it disappeared, Saturday night, Sept. 29. A night deputy manning the sheriff's radio watch said a call was received about 8:30 p.m. from Halfpap's Trailer Court that an object was in the sky near th;>re. The radio officer said patrol deputies sent in response to the rail sighted the object shortly after reaching the area and began trailing it. It moved east to Baldwin Field, where it became station- ary. Off.iers said the object hovered a short time and then disappeared. The ra io officer said that apparently while the patrol officers were keeping the object under observation at the airport, a call was received i.-om the Camp Point area reporting the object. The officer said the c;.ller told him that dogs were barking and other animals seem- ed upset. . A check vith. the FAA at Baldwin Field showed no planes were in the area at tht time. Radar in Kansas City reported only an airplane near Hannibal, m;ving west. The obje•:•: appeared to be red and white with a red glow or ring about its circular shape. Red and white lights showed alternately. The object was f.ying very high, but seemed to still be within the atmos- phere.  - At 9:45 Saturday night, Sept. 22, Brad Sanders and his wife, Richard Sanders and .Is wife, Larry Sanders and some of the Sanders' children all of HannilUl, Mo., were about four miles north of Hannibal, fishing on the river hen they observed a light about 45 degrees above the horizon towai. the northeast on the Illinois side of the river.

The object appeared to be rotating, they told George D. Fawcett, Mount Airy UFO Investigator. It was 300 feet off the side of the road and was in view for 20-30 seconds before it \"went out\" completely. At Ft. Wayne, Ind., Monday night, Sept. 24, two Ft. Wayne patrol- men checking out a report from a Churubusco woman of a UFO, said they saw the object tnemselves. They said it changed in color from black and white to dirty white to a reddish tan. They said it was due west of the city and moving slowly. Authorities at Baer Field were notified and confirmed they had no aircraft or balloons in the skies at the time of the phone call. They also said they saw the object. (\"Fort Wayne News Sentinel.\") On Sept. 19 Orange County Civil Defense aircraft spotters at Goshen, N. Y. were alerted at 10 p.m. after receiving reports that an unidenti- fied flying object had been observed by police and residents of the Monfoe-Warwick area. Sheriff Wilbur Sherwood said his department monitored a.radio com- munication between Patrolman Roger Phillips of the Monroe police and a Warwick police patrol that a strange looking object was circling in the Sugar Loaf section between the two communities. It was describ- ed as an. eliptical bright orange object with green and white lights. Phillips told \"The Evening News\" (Newburgh, N. Y.) of sighting three strange objects in the sky, and keeping them constantly under surveillance between 9:05 and 10 p.m. They were apparently several miles apart and all seemed to be at the same altitude and in line with each other. At times they all remained stationary, then they would move at great speed. Phillips said, \"They looked like the top of an ice cream cone, were silver in color, with a various amount of lights around the sides and across the top.\" Other police departments in Blooming Grove and Montgomery also reported they had seen the objects. A UFO eluded Michigan lawmen, Saturday, Sept. 29, although they rushed to the place where they saw it touch down. Montcalm County sheriff's deputies said they spotted mysterious object hovering at tree-top level in the Six Lakes area. The three deputies say the craft was round and very bright in appearance. By the time they reached the site where they believe it landed, the object was gone. (\"The Daily Tribune,\" Royal Oak, Mich.

Downing, MUFON -Religion Consultant Erich von Daniken's \"Chariots of the Gods?\" together with Rod Serling's TV narration of \"In Search of Ancient Astronauts,\" has opened up the whole issue of religion and the UFO problem. The large number of UFO sightings in the Southern states this past summer and the Serling TV broadcasts has people thinking. Paperback companies are buying up many of the little known old books on the subject, such as R. L. Dione's \"God Drives a Flying Saucer,\" (Ban- tam), and Erich Norman's \"Gods, Demons, and Space Chariots\" (Lancer), as well as Dr. Clifford Wilson»s \"Crash Go the Chariots\" (Lancer), an attempt- ed Christian rebuttal of von Daniken. There are now 175,000 copies of my book \"The Bible and Flying Saucers\" in print (Avon), and Sphere Books, of London, will publish an edition of my book in January. Furthermore,.the Conservative Christian magazine \"Christianity Today\" published a lengthy review which I wrote on Wilson's book entitled \"Space-Age Spin-Off.\" This is the first time a magazine at the center of the religious establishment (circulation of 200,000) has been involved in the subject. The issues being raised are very emotional and very deep. Those who have been involved in the scientific study of UFOs have sometimes hoped the religious issue would die and go away quietly—the religious kooks give the scientists a bad name! But the religious implications of the UFO problem are important to every person of the Christian and Jewish faith. As the religious issue becomes better known, there will be more reason for \"the average person\" to demand to know the truth about UFOs. If UFOs just happen to be space beings out on a tour of the universe, that is one thing. But if these beings have been a major cause of the Biblical religion, that is something else! Erich von Daniken has suggested that ancient astronauts (called angels) bombed Sodom (Genesis 19) with nuclear weapons. Clifford Wilson in \"Crash Go the Chariots\" has argued that it is more likely some type of explosion ,of underground gases destroyed Sodom. But this does not fit the Biblical description of fire raining down from heaven—the sky. Nor does it ex- plain how the \"angels\" knew the destruction was coming. Modern relig- ion has almost forgotten about angels, and so religious professionals do not even know how to begin to deal with the arguments now being raised. I have argued, for instance, that the \"pillar of cloud and of fire\" of the Exodus used its propulstion system to cause the parting of the Red Sea (Exodus 14:19-31). To my knowledge no religious leader has even men- tioned this theory in public. Von Daniken's theories, together with mine, suggest that beings from another world have had a direct influence on the history of the earth. We really have what the Bible has called \"guardian angels.\" Or maybe we have guardian demons, as Erich Norman suggests. Are we some kind of scientific experiment? Or does the Bible really explain what God's angels are doing, and do they really work for God? Those who have been students of the UFO problem for many years have been thinking about these questions for some time. They are just beginning to emerge in the mind of the general public. In the years ahead, I believe the religious issues in relation to UFOs are going to be more and more a part .of the total investigation. Science and religion are going to have to get together before the human race solves the UFO problem. It isn't too early to think about Christmas.

They pertain to UFO activity in the St. Charles, Mo. area and possible UFO landing traces in Iowa, respect- ively. The Sept. 24 NATIONAL EXAMINER featured a two-page article on Erich von Daniken, detailing some of the arguments against him by his critics. While on the subject of von Daniken, the Oct. 8 NEWSWEEK contained an article about his new book \"The Gold of the Gods,\" and again the arguments of his critics. The Nov. issue of FATE has an article by Dr. Hynek and William Powers on the \"spook light\" in the vicinity of Hornet, Mo. It is actually light refraction of the city lights of Miami, Kansas, they say. Sounds good, except that-Miami is actually in Oklahoma! Some unkind soul might say that if the investigators don't know where the \" town is, their \"explanation\" might also be questionable. Well. . . ! This issue of FATE also has a short \"filler\" item on Canadian UFO reports. Sept. BEYOND REALITY contains two articles on UFOs (one by Ar- thur Shuttlewood),. as well as Hayden Hewes 1 regular UFO column. John Keel's latest article appears in the Nov. issue of SAGA. It deals with underwater objects and is largely a rehash of the Nor- • wegian incidents of late 19'/2. The latest book by Louis Pauwels & Jacques Bergier, THE ETERNAL MAN (previously reviewed in this column), is now available in an Avon paperback edition for $1.50. Former SAUCERS, SPACE & SCIENCE editor Gene Duplantier has re- cently published two booklets, OUTER SPACE HUMOR and HIDDEN PLANETS, which are available from him at $1.25 each. The first is a collect- ion of space-oriented jokes and cartoons; the second concerns the search for previously-undiscovered planets, such as \"Vulcan\" and \"Planet X.\" He also mentions the research of Duncan Lunan and his \"alien space probe\" hypothesis. Two additional booklets are planned and I hope to review those when they are published. Gene's address is: 17 Shetland St., Willowdale, Ontario, Canada M2M 1X5. Anyone interested in a serious study of contactees and others of a mystical bent who claim to receive \"messages\" from higher intelli- gences will surely enjoy reading Brad Steiger's REVELATION: THE DI- VINE FIRE. A great deal of research has gone into this volume, as will be evident to the reader. One chapter is specificially devoted to UFO contactees, but other references to them can be found through- out the book. I certainly consider it one of Steiger's best efforts and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the \"deeper\" aspects of Ufology and related subjects. The book is available from Prentice Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliff, N. J. 07632 for $7.95. Another book proving the possibilities of advanced civilizations in the past is Charles Berlitz's MYSTERIES FROM FORGOTTEN WORLDS. It contains sonsiderable familiar material, but some of the photos Ber- litz includes have not been publicized previously and are quite in- teresting. He discusses the Great Pyramid, the ancient civilizations of South America, Atlantis, the Piri Reis maps, legendsof flight in antiquity, etc. Well worth reading.

Cetus is an enormous constellation ranking fourth in total area covered. It is not a conspicious constellation in spite of its size. Almost in the middle of Cetus is one of the best known and least under- stood of all the stars. This is Omicron Ceti (Mira). Mira means the \"wonderful.\" It is a variable star that ranges from 2nd to the 10th mag- nitude. Mira was the first of the long-period variables to be discovered by the Dutch astronomer Fabricus on August 13, 1596. One messier object is located in Cetus. It is M-77— a bright and compact spiral galaxy containing three distinct sets of spiral arms. Long exposure photographs of M-77 reveal very faint outer arms of amor- phous texture and very low surface brightness forming an elliptical ring around the whole system. This galaxy and the famous Sombrero galaxy were the first two systems in which a very large red shift was detected, thus introducing the astronomical world to the mystery of the expanding uni- verse.
