Crop circle analysis shows that most are not hoaxes By Nancy Talbott Although some instances of the phenomenon known as \"crop circles\" are apparently created by people, scientific analysis of the affected plants and soils indicates that slightly more than 90% of forma- tions tested have a more interesting-and more com- plex-causation. The BLT Research Team (John Burke, Dr. Wm. C. Levengood, Nancy Talbott) has been systemati- cally studying plants and soils sampled from crop for- mations in the U.S., Canada, England, and several other countries since 1989, and then comparing these plants and soils to control samples taken at various specific distances away from the for- mations, but in the same fields. The results of this research have been published in two peer-reviewed scientific journals in 1994 and 1995. The 1994 paper 1 discussed the plant abnormali- ties documented, and the 1995 paper 2 presented the finding of meteoric iron on plant stems and in the soil. A third paper has been submitted for publication which presents the discovery that observed plant alterations often follow the well-known Beer-Lambert Principle in physics, 3 which describes the absorption of electro- magnetic energy by matter. Dr. Wm. C. Levengood, a Michigan biophysi- cist with more than 40 years experience working both in industry and at the University of Michigan, does most of the laboratory work. He holds a B.S. in Physics and Mathematics from the University of Toledo, an M.A. is Bioscience from Ball State University, an M.S. in Biophysics from the University of Michigan, and a Ph.D. equivalent based also on work completed at the University of Michigan. Since 1956 he has published widely in main- stream scientific journals, including multiple papers in Nature and Science; holds several patents; and is a member of the American Association for the Advance- ment of Science as well as several other professional societies. For the past 15 years, in addition to pursuing private research interests, he has worked as a consult- ant to several seed-growing companies and agricul- tural concerns. In recent years the BLT Research Team has extended its inquiry, discovering that many of the plant and soil abnormalities found at crop formation sites are also present at UFO-trace cases and unusual ani- mal death locations. At the request of Linda Howe sev- eral years ago, Dr. Levengood agreed to examine wheat and pasture grass samples from a mutilation site 4 which had been discovered within 60 ft. of an ovoid area of flattened crops near Garnet, KS. The wheat stems from the flattened ovoid area revealed a massive incidence of \"expulsion cavities\" at the stem nodes, an effect in- dicating an internal pressure so sudden and powerful that it literally blew holes through the node walls as the internal liquid in the plant stems expanded. There were also very significant alterations in the growth rates of seedlings germinated from the wheat seeds taken from plants in the ovoid's center, with a reduction in seedling heights of-35.8% as com- pared to the controls. These results are typical of find- ings continually obtained at crop formation sites, and strongly suggest rapid heating such as would be caused by the exposure of the plants to microwave radiation, as well as exposure to unusual electrical fields. Although it has been suggested that helicopter downwash might be responsible for the creation of cir- cular flattened areas of crops, Dr. Levengood is cer- tain that the effects noted above, as well as the dra- matic lengthening of the plant stem node-which was also discovered in this incident-is instead a character- istic of electromagnetic radiation, probably microwave, emanating from the epicenter of the ovoid. Cell wall pits enlarged When the pasture grasses sampled immediately around the dead animal were examined under the mi- croscope, and the results compared with the examina- tion of the control grasses, the cell wall pits in the plants near the body were found to be enlarged to more than three times the diameter of the pits in the control samples. This finding suggested the same sort of rapid heating believed to be responsible for many of the changes discovered in the wheat samples taken from the nearby ovoid area, indicating a quite possible link between the two events, as well as the need for addi- tional research of similar events. Since this 1994 Garnet, KS, case the BLTTeam has sampled and examined both plants and soils (as well as occasional anomalous substances) at several dozen unusual animal death sites (Dr. Levengood pre- fers the term \"bovine excision\" sites) here in the U.S. and in Canada. Several reports 5 have been issued which discuss the findings obtained. Much of the work done on the grasses usually present at these locations in-"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 September 1998 MUFON UFO Journal Expulsion cavities, Logan, Utah.

When plants are exposed to increased levels of radiation-in this case microwaves-the mitochondria are often irreversibly damaged, thus altering their res- piration patterns. It is these respiration patterns which are monitored and which reveal the mitochondrial dam- age in plants which have been exposed to unusual ra- diation. In case after case these altered respiration cycles have been documented in the plants sampled at bovine excision sites. Laboratory simulation, by ex- posing control grasses to commercially available sources of microwave radiation, produces the same re- sults. Either microwave radiation-or an energy ex- tremely similar-is involved. Increased magnetic material Additionally, in recent years extensive soil sam- pling has been carried out at bovine excision sites ex- amined by Dr. Levengood. In the crop formation re- search, soils sampled from within and outside the flat- tened crop areas have revealed significantly increased amounts of magnetic material mixed in with the soils; this finding, too, has been replicated in the unusual animal death cases, sometimes massively. In a 1997 Colorado case submitted for analysis by Christo- pher O'Brien, massive amounts of micron-sized mag- netite spheres were discovered during microscopic ex- amination, particularly at the sampling site near the head area. The amount of such magnetic particles which might normally be expected to be present is in the range of 0.4 mg/gram of soil, but here a count of 284.3 mg/g was found. This count dropped off significantly in soils sampled farther away from the body, strongly suggest- ing that highly unusual magnetic fields had been asso- ciated with the event. Although Dr. Levengood and the BLT Team's primary interest has been the crop formation phenom- enon, as word of the laboratory results began to reach people interested in other areas, specific requests to examine plants, soils, and unusual substances related to other unusual situations began to come in regularly. In 1995 the \"Sightings\" TV show, then investigating a number of apparent UFO-trace cases, asked for analy- sis of plants, soils, and a number of unknown substances sampled at several Israeli UFO cases: 7 the 1987 Shikmona Beach incident, a 1994 event, and a grass formation found in early 1995. Low melting point Soil samples from the Shikmona Beach case included a very dark red, almost black, granular sub- stance mixed in with the clay soil. This substance had an extremely low melting point, becoming bubbly un- der the microscope light, and then hardening back into a black mass of rounded particles once the light had been turned off. Without more extensive geophysical testing, this substance remains a mystery. Pure silicon In the 1994 circle formation a white substance found at the center of the event and a red coating dis- covered on the stems and leaves of plants sampled in the circle were both subjected to energy dispersive spec- troscopy (EDS), which revealed that the white crystals were in fact pure silicon, but without the \"growth lines\" characteristic of silicon crystals which have been thermochemically grown in a laboratory. The red ma- terial produced a high iron peak, but in the presence of so many other elements as to obscure it's identity. The plant samples from the grass formation at Qadima in 1995 revealed alterations again consistent with exposure to rather prolonged, localized heating, in addition to other changes which confirmed the pres- ence of energetic changes to the plants similar to those observed within many crop formations. Over the past several years the BLT Team has examined numerous samples of peculiar substances dis- covered at crop formations, bovine excision sites, and reported UFO-related events. Many of the substances analyzed have turned out to be basically silicates-the most abundant compound on earth. However, the trans- formation of the silicate materials into highly unusual crystalline forms in these various samples (forms which are entirely uncommon in the published scientific lit- erature of crystallography) is quite remarkable. Ear- lier in his professional career, Dr. Levengood worked for many years with silicate crystals, thus recognizing immediately the uniqueness of many of these samples. The unusualness of the samples themselves, in combi- nation with the curious locations and situations in which they were found, is of great interest. Unusual forms of silicone In addition to the discovery of pure silicon at the 1994 Israel location (a unique finding, to date), sili- cone-with highly unusual external forms-has been dis- covered repeatedly. Two recent cases include a Neth- erlands crop formation (Brummen, Holland, 1997) and a May, 1998, apparent UFO-trace case in Israel. An unusual form of a soluble silicate 8 was discovered in a 1994 Elaine, MN, crop formation which may also be UFO-related, and, quite recently, two extremely un- usual silicate substances have been analyzed in con- junction with two separate abductee experiences here in the U.S. Analysis of these and many other substances found at crop formations in many countries, at bovine excision sites in the U.S. and Canada, at UFO-related trace cases in several countries, and, most recently, two abduction experiences here in the U.S. are slowly pro-"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Page 6 September 1998 MUFON UFO Journal ducing a solid scientific database-facts which clearly indicate certain physical commonalities among the vari- ous events while pointing directly toward the fact that something very physically real, if as yet completely unrecognized by mainstream science, is \"afoot with the cosmos.\" Control studies Control studies are an important aspect of sci- entific inquiry. In the case of crop circles, the question has been raised as to whether people-armed with planks and boards, or rollers, or simply their feet-might be responsible for the many thousands of formations re- ported all over the world in the past 15 years or so. Although the logistics might argue against such a conclusion, this has been the solution presented by most of the media for many years. Agronomists and plant physiologists have speculated that over-fertilization of the crops might be the culprit; and feeding crows, mating hedgehogs, and crazed prairie dogs have also been suggested by a number of highly imaginative individuals. In an effort to examine the more reasonable of these ideas, the BLTTeam executed two separate control studies 9 which examined the no- tion that people using both boards and a cement roller might be the causative agency, as well as the effects of 100% over-fertilization on a test crop field. Results are clear The results were quite clear: manually down- ing crops with boards or cement rollers does not pro- duce any of the plant anomalies reported over the years by the BLT Team. In these control studies the plants did not exhibit any of the typically observed (always at the statistically significant level) changes found in more than 90% of the formations sampled from sev- eral different countries. Specifically, these plants from the manmade control formations did not reveal: 1. grossly enlarged or elongated plant stem nodes; 2. marked bending of plant stem nodes; 3. the presence of \"expulsion\" cavities at nodal points; 4. stunted or malformed seed-heads; 5. markedly significant alterations in seed ger- mination trials (including seeds which do not germi- nate at all, or seeds which do germinate but exhibit severely depressed seed growth, or seeds which do germinate but display seedling development inconsis- tent with that which is typical for the species or vari- ety, or seeds which not only germinate but exhibit mark- edly increased robustness and rate of seedling growth). There was bending of the plant stems noted, particularly in a young, immature crop, within 3-5 days after manual flattening; this effect is due primarily to gravitropism (the term now used to describe the growth of plant organs in response to gravity; the old term, \"geotropism,\" is no longer accurate since the effect has been observed in zero-gravity experiments with crops in space). The gravitropism effect occurs much more rapidly than phototropism (the growth of plant organs in response to light), which occurs much more slowly, although in a young crop phototropism may play a role when node bending is observed several weeks after downing the crop. The point here is that moderate node bending does occur, particularly in an immature crop, having nothing whatsoever to do with genuine crop formation energies-and this sort of node- bending is distinguishable from that which has been reported in the BLT Team's research reports. Same results Furthermore, in the control study which exam- ined the effects of over-fertilization on field crops, the same results were obtained: none of the basic criteria by which the BLT Research Team identifies genuine crop formations were found-no elongated nodes, no marked bending, no \"expulsion\" cavities, no stunted or malformed seed-heads, and no significant alterations in seed germination trials. It was interesting to find that, although farm- ers have long thought that over-fertilization and subse- quent violent weather conditions were the causes of randomly-downed crop regularly found in their fields, not one single stalk went down in the 100% over-fertilized test strip, in spite of several severe storms in the test area during the summer this control study was implemented. In fact, it has been known for some time that so-called \"lodging\" (randomly-downed crop with no discernable geometric pattern) is related to the geo- metric crop circle phenomenon. The BLT Team has done considerable testing of randomly-downed crops, 10 both when found by themselves in fields and when found in the same fields as geometric formations, dis- covering the same basic \"energy signature\" in the downed plants. The major difference appears to be in the intensity of the energies involved, with the randomly-downed crop exhibiting a greater degree of change than that found in the more visually interesting geometric designs. Energy complex to blame? So, real lodging-downed crop that is due to over-fertilization (which causes over-development of the seed-head and subsequent weakening of the plant stem) and subsequent weather damage-can and occa- sionally does occur; but this cause of randomly-downed crop is less frequent than is currently recognized. The BLT Team suspects that, much more frequently, the cause of randomly-downed crop lies with the energy"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal September 1998 Page? complex responsible for the more notorious crop circles. A few final facts for the thoughtful reader to consider. Patches of standing plants found inside many geometric crop formations, as well as massive areas of standing crop outside the visible formation borders, up to a tested distance of 300 ft. away,\" have revealed both the altered respiration rate cycles and anomalous seedling growth-rate changes already discussed; and these changes in the standing plants (which from a vi- sual standpoint appear to be completely unaffected) are often as severe, or even more so, than the plant alterations found in the flattened crop. This \"spillover\" effect has also been found in fields with both geomet- ric and randomly-downed crop. Furthermore, node-length increases in plant stems have been found to decrease as a function of sampling distance away from the epicenter of an event, producing near-perfect linear curves, and in beautiful agreement with the Beer-Lambert Principle of physics (which describes the absorption of electro- magnetic energy by matter). This Beer-Lambert corre- lation has been found repeatedly in downed crops in circular events when they were sampled meticulously enough, and it has also (in 1997, at Salem, Oregon) been found in standing crop on two different sides of a geometric formation 12 in which there were many other anomalies present. Significant linear correlations And, finally, in a 1997 New York state crop formation 13 sampled with real diligence by Larry Tho- mas (one where UFOs were witnessed near or over the field in which the formation was later discovered), very significant linear correlations were obtained by examining the relationship between the amount of mag- netite material in the soil and the distance from the epicenters of the sampled circles. The type of linear distribution obtained was shown to agree with the fun- damental physics of centrifugal forces on particles sus- pended in a rotating plasma system. Increased amounts of magnetic particles in the soils at unusual animal death sites have also been found to decrease in a linear fash- ion with sampling distance away from the carcass. The importance of field workers Over the last 8 years somewhere in the neigh- borhood of 200 fieldworkers here in the U.S., in Canada, England, the Netherlands, Germany, Austra- lia, and Israel have contributed their time, energy, and financial support in the gathering of samples. Without them this research could not continue. There is also a large reporting network of individuals who keep us in- formed of new events, often within hours of their oc- currence. The sampling and reporting networks are growing each year, with new groups being trained in the field sampling protocols; and recently a grant has been awarded BLT to enlarge the geological aspects of the investigation. In the face of indifference from the general media and larger society, this cooperation between people of similar curiosity and purpose, scat- tered all around the globe, is both essential and very sustaining. We all know that the constantly recited re- frain, \"there is no hard evidence,\" is just an indication of ignorance-there is so much \"hard\" evidence, and so much more just waiting to be developed, that we're having a hard time keeping up.

The Setting Most of these events took place in or near Varginha. It is a lively, busy city of about 120,000 people in the south of Minas Gerais (in Portuguese, the name means General Mines), a huge state with thou- sands of cities, towns and villages; millions of people; many ore-rich mines and other natural resources; and lots of industries, including auto manufacturing plants. Varginha is almost equidistant from Brazil's three largest cities- about 200 miles north of Sao Paulo, 200 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro and nearly 200 miles south of Belo Horizonte. It has a number of industries, including multi-na- tional corporations (American, Canadian, English and French), and is a leading coffee exporting center. It has three hospitals, four universities and vocational- technical training centers, four daily newspapers, four radio stations and three TV stations. Much of the state is mountainous and Varginha, 3,100 feet above sea level, is spread out over a num- ber of hills. Contrary to some Internet reports, there are no jungles or predatory wild animals within at least a thousand miles. The countryside is lush and green, with much of it devoted to growing coffee. The Main Capture Site Many of the main incidents in the case occurred in or near woods that separate the Jardim Andere and Santana neighborhoods,, both about a mile and a half east of downtown Varginha. The woods run a bit more than a mile north and south and are 200 to 300 yards wide east and west. A small stream runs through the woods. An east-west street connecting Jardim Andere and Santana cuts through the middle of the woods, and a single set of railroad tracks runs through the area, skirting the upper edge of the woods on the Jardim Andere side. A number of well-worn paths run through the woods and a huge adjoining pasture, and these are Bob Pratt BRASILIA MINAS GERAIS ATLANTIC OCEAN used regularly by people going to and from Jardim Andere and Santana. The three young women who saw the creature had planned to go through the woods as they took a short cut home. They were walking downhill when they entered the vacant lot, which is three blocks above the railroad tracks and the woods. NORAD, January 13 Pacaccini-who arranges for the shipment of goods into and out of Brazil in sea-going cargo con- tainers and also manages his family's three coffee farms-is the investigator who was given the informa- tion about NORAD's notifying Brazilian authorities about the UFOs. In Incidente em Varginha, Pacaccini said that in July in Belo Horizonte a Brazilian Air Force officer told him NORAD had notified CINDACTA, the Bra- zilian civilian-military air traffic control system, and CINDACTA alerted the ESA Army command in Tres Cora9oes. This was on Jan. 13, but what time of day or night is not known. Other than one incident to be related in a mo- ment, there were no UFO sightings in the. vicinity of Varginha on Jan. 13 or 20, but many were reported throughout the region as well as around the country before and after, continuing through much of the year.

He was going to Tres Corafoes, about 150 miles to the north, and wanted to get an early start the next morning. Da Souza owns an exterminating busi- ness, and his hobby is flying ultralight planes. He planned to meet other ultralight pilots to arrange for a competition. He awakened at 4 a.m. on Jan. 13, got into his red pickup truck and headed north on the dangerous, heavily traveled Fernao Dias highway which connects Sao Paulo and Belo Horizonte. The drive was unevent- ful until about 8 a.m., when he was about three miles south of the intersection of the highway that leads to Varginha to the west and Tr8s Corafoes to the east. His thoughts were interrupted by a muffled roaring sound, and he wondered if something was wrong with the truck. He stopped to check, but when he stepped down from the cab he realized the noise was coming from a cigar-shaped craft about 400 feet in the air just west of the highway. A jagged hole in front It was silver-colored, reflecting the sun, and appeared to be 30 to 40 feet long and 12 to 15 feet wide. It had at least four windows along the side and what looked like a big jagged hole four or five feet in diameter in the front. There was a long dent or crack running from the hole back to the middle of the craft, from which point white smoke or vapor was coming out. The craft was traveling north, almost parallel to the highway, at about 40 to 50 miles an hour. Astonished and excited, Da Souza jumped in his pickup and followed the UFO for about 10 miles. It soon crossed over to the east side of the highway and eventually passed over some small mountains. Then it went into a 30-degree dive and disappeared from sight. Da Souza was afraid it had crashed and desperately searched for a way to get to the area. After 20 minutes or so, he found a dirt side road and turned onto it. Wreckage and soldiers A few minutes later he drove over the crest of a hill and there before him was wreckage spread all over a hilly field of knee-high grass. He also saw about 40 soldiers and two male nurses, two trucks, a heli- copter, an ambulance and three cars-all Army vehicles. Everyone was busily running around picking up pieces of debris. One truck already held a chunk half the size of a mini-van. A strong smell of ammonia and ether hung in the air. It was a terrible crash and Da Souza doubted that anyone had lived through it. He was surprised to see anyone there, let alone the military. He didn't know at the time that the site was only seven miles from the ESA Army base in Tres Coracoes. He parked and walked toward the wreckage, thinking he could help. He picked up a piece of alumi- Investigators, from left, A. J.

Then one of the men spot- ted him, shouted, and in an instant armed soldiers rushed toward him, ordering him to leave immediately. He protested, thinking someone had been badly hurt or killed, but a corporal screamed at him to get out, that \"this is none of your business!\" Da Souza was so astounded by what he'd seen that he abandoned his trip and headed back toward Sao Paulo. About 10 minutes later he stopped at a road- side restaurant to have coffee and think about what had happened. The emotional impact was so great that he was still sitting there two hours later when a car drove up with two men in civilian clothes, but military haircuts and bearing. One got out and walked up to him, asked if his name was Carlos da Souza, then asked what he'd seen. \"I saw everything and I know something hap- pened there,\" Da Souza said. \"You haven't seen any- thing,\" the man replied, then related many details of Da Souza's personal life, such as: \"You live on such and such a road, in such and such a city, you're mar- ried to so and so, and you're the father of so many children, and your mother is so and so...

The man warned him not to say any- thing to anybody, then left. Keeps quiet This occurred on Jan. 13, one week before the three women saw the creature in nearby Varginha, but for nine months Da Souza told no one except his wife and two close friends. He was frightened by the man's threat. A 20-year military dictatorship had ended only a few years earlier, and some of Da Souza's relatives \"disappeared\" during the dictatorship, so he kept quiet.

An inspection of the area-now nine months later-showed no indication that a crash had occurred, nor was Ubirajara subsequently able to find any farmers, farm workers, or anyone else in the area who knew any- thing about a crash. Not everyone believes Da Souza's story, and even Ubirajara and Covo have reservations about it because no other witnesses could be found. Also, some elements of his story were similar to things that had been portrayed in the movie Roswell. In addition, his description of the UFO was almost identical to one seen by a farm couple on the morning of Jan. 20 which Ubirajara-and much of the public-had known about since early in the investigation. However, on a later visit to the site Ubirajara and members of his Varginha UFO group found an area of ground about 400 feet square that seemed to have been replaced by sod. Further, several military wit- nesses had said they saw pieces of a crashed craft be- ing brought into ESA by two Army trucks on Jan. 13, and that later the wreckage was convoyed to the na- tional aerospace center in Sao Jose dos Campos near Sao Paulo. \"There are things that favored Da Souza's report,\" Ubirajara told us, \"but we have to say we could not verify it.\" The Farm Couple, January 20 Early on the morning of Saturday Jan. 20 on a farm six miles east of Varginha, Oralina de Freitas, 37, was awakened by the sound of cattle milling around, mooing and bellowing. A digital clock on the bedside table said 1:14 a.m. Oralina opened the window and saw the cattle were very agitated and stampeding all over the pasture 300 to 400 feet away. Then she saw a cigar-shaped object just above the cattle. There was no moon, but the craft gave off a faint light. Oralina called out to her husband, Eurico, 40, and he rushed to the window. \"My God!\" he cried. \"There's a submarine above my pasture.\" They could see gray smoke or vapor coming out of the back as it moved slowly, in a sort of rocking motion, only 15 to 20 feet above the ground. Neither Eurico nor Oralina ventured outside, but stood at the window watching as the object took 45 minutes to pass ever so slowly out of sight over a ridge about 2,000 feet away, heading in the direction of Varginha. They had the impression it was having difficulties of some kind because of the very slow way it was moving. If"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal September 1998 Page 11 the UFO was making any sound, it was drowned out by the cows' bellowing. All this time the cattle remained panicky and frightened but the couple's four dogs, al- though awake, showed no reaction. Eurico and Oralina's four children, aged 12 to 20, slept through it all. Ubirajara learned about the incident six days later. The couple, who oversee the farm, told the owner what happened, and he in turn told a friend of Ubirajara's, who passed the story on to him. The farm house is only about five miles cross country from the spot where Carlos da Souza says he first saw a similar UFO on Jan. 13. The Morning Capture, January 20 In Brazil, the Military Police are not members of a military organization nor part of the armed forces, but are state police under the control of a state's gov- ernor. Military Policemen perform a variety of duties, including patrolling highways, putting down riots, and rescuing people in floods and other disasters. They are also the firemen for the entire nation, and one of their duties as fire fighters is capturing mad dogs, wild ani- mals and dangerous snakes. It was in this capacity that four firemen an- swered a call around 8:30 on the morning of Jan. 20 about a strange creature being seen near the woods in Jardim Andere. One or more persons had phoned po- lice, who alerted the Fire Department. The investigators learned that by the time the firemen responded, three boys 12 to 14 years old had seen the creature as they were walking along Rua Suecia. This is the first horizontal street that runs above the steep, 200-foot-long embankment that leads down to the previously described railroad tracks and woods just beyond. Then along came a man and a woman, not together, and they saw the creature also. At the time it was slowly shuffling down the precipitous bank toward the woods. The boys had been throwing stones at it trying to get a reaction from it. The woman told them to stop. A secret operation? When the firemen arrived in a fire truck, they told all five to leave the area immediately, saying it was a secret Army operation. By then the creature had disappeared into the woods. Wearing their regular uni- forms and heavy gloves and carrying nets, the firemen then went down the bank, crossed the tracks and en- tered the woods in search of the creature. It took them two hours to capture it, because it kept running away from them in the dense growth, and partly perhaps be- cause they were afraid of whatever it was. Some re- ports claim it gave off a very strong, offensive odor. They caught glimpses of it from time to time but it kept scurrying away from them. If you walk into the woods, it's easy to see why the creature was able to elude the firemen for so long. Thick, tangled bushes and countless trees pre- vent you from seeing very far, and the footing is tricky even when following one of the paths. The terrain is rough and uneven, all up and down with almost no level areas. Cars and trucks can be heard on nearby streets but are seldom seen. When the men were finally able to throw a net over the creature, it offered no resistance but it made a buzzing or humming sound as they struggled up the hill with it in the net. Apparently at some time during the search, one of the firemen had returned to the fire truck momentarily and radioed his commander, told him what was happening, and asked him to join them. By the time the creature was carried up to Rua Suecia, the commander had arrived-as had an Army truck with two officers and a sergeant (possibly notified by the fire commander). The firemen handed the creature over to the Army men with little or no discussion. It was put in a wooden box, which was then covered by a canvas, put in the back of the truck with two men sitting beside it, and the truck left in a hurry to return to the Army base in Tres Cora?6es. The firemen and their commander then returned to the fire station. The jogger, January 20 Some time between 1:30 and 2 o'clock in the afternoon, a jogger saw seven armed soldiers cross a small footbridge from Santana into the pasture next to the woods in Jardim Andere. The pasture is on the side of a long hill leading 500 to 600 yards up to the rail- road tracks and Suecia street above, where the fire truck had parked that morning. Two of the soldiers were car- rying automatic rifles and all were wearing side arms. Two carried small rectangular aluminum-colored boxes or suitcases. The jogger wondered what they were doing. He had intended to take a shortcut down the pasture and across the bridge but changed his mind. The sol- diers grouped into a V formation and moved up the hill, searched a small grove of trees just below the tracks, apparently found nothing, then turned and moved toward the big woods. The jogger, seeing them enter the woods, con- tinued straight ahead for several blocks and then turned into the street leading to Santana. A minute or two later, three distinct shots were heard. Extremely curious, the jogger returned to the street overlooking the woods and saw an army truck with soldiers in it parked there. At that moment, four of the soldiers who had gone into the woods came struggling up the steep em- bankment carrying two bags, two soldiers to each bag. One bag was squirming as if something live was in it,"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Page 12 September 1998 MUFON UFO Journal but the other had no movement. The bags were heaved into the truck, the soldiers climbed in, and the truck sped away. Just what was in the bags is not known. However, it would seem safe to assume it wouldn't take seven armed soldiers to capture a wild animal when four firemen without weapons had captured another \"wild animal\" in the same woods a few hours earlier- and had turned it over to Army personnel without any discussion. Creature encounter, January 20 For some weeks the only thing most people knew about the \"Varginha ET\" was the encounter that Liliane, Valqufria and Katia had with a creature at 3 o'clock in the afternoon of Jan. 20. That incident, de- scribed in detail earlier, was publicized literally around the world. But, as we now know, it was just one in a series of related events. Luiza da Silva, the mother of the two sisters, said that when she and Katia went to the vacant lot, they saw an impression in the grass where the creature had been and they noticed a strong odor. But less than three hours later all that vanished. \"There was a hail- storm at 6 o'clock that was absolutely unprecedented,\" said Ubirajara. \"It lasted only three or four minutes, but it broke windshields and everything and wiped out all traces of the creature in the vacant lot.\" During or just after the 6 p.m. storm as mili- tary and police continued their search, two plainclothes agents spotted yet another creature-possibly the one that the three women had seen earlier. It was hiding in a construction site in the Santana-Jardim Andere area not far from the woods. The two men were able to capture it and force it into the back seat of their un- marked Military Police car. It may have been ill, be- cause the men reportedly took it to a small public health clinic, but the doctor there refused to go near the crea- ture and told them to take it to a hospital. Sometime during all this, one of the officers, Marco Chereze, 23, stopped by his parents' house, soaked from the rain, and told his mother he was on a mission and would be working all night. He asked her to tell his wife he wouldn't be home for dinner, changed his clothes and left. Death of an officer Only Chereze is believed to have handled the creature with his bare hands while capturing it, and he became gravely ill some days later with an unusual infection. He was admitted to a hospital with a very high fever. He rapidly lost use of his arms and legs, and was unable to feed himself. At the end, he turned blue and failed to respond to treatment. He died on Feb. 15. The only advice given his family was that the coffin should be sealed, the funeral should take place without delay, and burial should follow within a few Vitorio Pacaccini posing where creature was seen next to block wall of abandoned building. hours. His father later recalled that when rumors of ETs first began to circulate, Marco was convinced that this was only the beginning of a lot of trouble. Marco's grandmother said that one night when the first reports of ETs came out in the newspaper, she was watching TV with him and his wife when a movie about aliens came on. Marco immediately switched the set off and said sharply: \"Don't watch that-it's nonsense!\" His outburst was puzzling and he offered no explanation. Chereze's family reportedly sued the Mili- tary Police because the cause of his death was never explained. The results of any autopsy were never re- vealed-the only thing of note was a lab report saying a \"small quantity of toxic material\" had been found in his body-and allegedly his official records were altered to state that he wasn't on duty that night. The creature at the Zoo, April 21 In the evening, Terezinha Clepf, her husband and some friends attended a birthday party at a restau- rant in Varginha's zoo. Around 9 o'clock, after eating, Mrs. Clepf, 67, went outside to sit on the veranda by herself and smoke a cigarette. Several minutes later she began to feel uneasy. \"I felt that someone was look- ing at me,\" she said later. The porch was dark but some light was coming from the restaurant. \"I turned to my left and saw a strange creature staring at me.\" It was about 15 feet away and appeared to be four to five feet tall. \"I didn't know what it was, an animal or what- ever,\" Mrs. Clepf said. \"It was very ugly. It was brown"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal September 1998 Page 13 and had a brightness or shininess to the skin. The eyes were big and red, and the mouth was just a stroke. He stayed there looking at me.\" She was so terrified she could barely move for about seven minutes. Then, afraid to make any sudden movement, she slowly got up and walked back inside. She looked back once and the crea- ture was still staring at her. It was several days before she could tell her husband about it. The Zoo Deaths After that incident was publicized, Lelia Cabral, director of the zoo, contacted Ubirajara and Pacaccini and told them that five animals had mysteriously died about a week before Mrs. Clepf's experience. An ant- eater, two deer, a blue macaw, and a bobcat died sud- denly and unexpectedly. The anteater was healthy and tame. It died because of an \"unidentified toxic sub- stance,\" Mrs. Cabral said. The deer died of \"caustic intoxication without apparent cause\" and no cause of death could be determined for the macaw and bobcat. Around 10 o'clock on the night of May 3 or 4, Liliane and Valqufria da Silva and their mother Luiza were asleep at their home in Santana when someone knocked on the front door. The father was working as a fare collector on a bus, and the family's two older daughters were at school. Mrs. Silva went to the front door and saw four men dressed in dark suits. She thought they were associated with Ubirajara, but soon realized they were strangers. By then, however, the men had gently pushed their way inside and insisted on talking to Liliane and Valqufria. The Threat to the Sisters Luiza got them up and everyone gathered in the small living room, the girls and mother on one sofa, the four men on another sofa opposite them. One man was about 50, the others in their early 30s. They were polite but businesslike. Only the older man and one of the others talked. They never identified themselves, but spent more than an hour trying to get the girls to change their story, and even implied they would be paid a lot of money if they made their denials publicly on TV. Afraid to object, Luiza said they would think it over. \"They never raised their voices, but we felt intimi- dated,\" Liliane said. The men finally left, but told them not to follow them to try to see what kind of car they were driving. The men were never seen again, and the girls did not withdraw their story. Highway Sighting, May 15 A 21-year-old biology student, Ildo Lucio Gordino, was driving from Tres Cora96es to Varginha around 7:30 P.M. As he was rounding a curve, a strange animal started to cross the highway. \"I had slowed be- cause of the curve,\" Ildo said. \"About 40 meters ahead the headlights shone on a dark brown thing with hair all over its body. It had huge eyes that reflected red in the headlights. It covered its face with its hands and crouched down.\" Badly frightened, Ildo drove past the creature, which rose up and hurried back into the bushes. When Ubirajara and Pacaccini investigated, they were sur- prised to find it had happened next to the farm where Eurico and Oralina de Freitas had seen a UFO on Jan. 20. A seventh creature was seen several times in May 1996 in Passes, a city about 40 miles north of Varginha, but whether it should be included as part of the \"Varginha ET\" case is questionable because this one was reportedly violent. A 20-year-old man named Luciano says he was walking home late one dark night when a hairy creature about five-foot-five and with a strange growl jumped out from the trees and attacked him. Luciano is six-foot-five and weighs 190 pounds but was knocked to the ground, his shirt and jacket ripped by sharp claws. He kicked out and knocked the creature off balance, jumped up, and ran, but was knocked down again. In the scuffle, Luciano kicked the creature in the groin, causing it to double over, and Luciano was finally able to escape to a nearby house. Pacaccini, who investigated and saw Luciano's injuries and torn clothing, is convinced he was telling the truth. A week later Pacaccini and another investi- gator found three other persons in Passos who said they too had been attacked. Not knowing what the crea- ture was and for lack of a more accurate term, all four victims described it as a \"werewolf.\" Pacaccini believes the Passos creature is real and unexplained, but doubts it is related to the Varginha creatures because of its size, hairiness, and vicious na- ture. \"We are talking about a completely different crea- ture, in a totally different situation,\" Pacaccini said. The Americans Almost from the beginning, some investigators were convinced that the creatures had been taken to the United States. This conviction was based largely on (1) the belief that these creatures truly were from some place other than Earth, and (2) statements made by disgruntled military personnel who resented the idea that Brazil would relinquish control and turn the aliens over to the U.S. This conviction was further strengthened in early March 1996-just five weeks after the initial inci- dents-by the visit to Sao Paulo and other parts of Bra- zil of then-U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and NASA Director Daniel S. Goldin, ostensibly to arrange for a Brazilian astronaut to join a future Space Shuttle flight.

Therefore, I leave you with this: It is impos- o | sible for you to conceive how far up is, except for the limitations of your own mind. A question of youth By Thomas J. Lyon As you and your readers know, I recently re- signed as Director of the MUFON Associate Mem- bers Auxiliary. I feel that I need to address the reason for my leaving, so that people are not confused, and so they do not misunderstand me. During my term of Di- rector, I came up with many ideas, plans, and goals, which were all attainable. These goals were created for not only the benefit of the youth in MUFON, but also for the entire MUFON membership. What many people do not realize is that there is a need for younger people to carry on the very toil- some task of seeking the origin and nature of the UFO phenomenon. After a while, people may lose interest, and not become as involved as they should be. As Commissioner John A Johnson from the New York State Office for Children and Family Ser- vices said at the 1998 Governor's Conference on Youth, \"Youth are problem solvers, not a problem to be solved.\" This is something that many people need to realize and take into consideration when they look at today's youth. It seems as though whenever a respected individual looks at our kids today, all they can see are the negative things. They do not even take the time to look for the positive characteristics of the youth. As a member of the New York State Youth Leadership Congress, I wanted to try to change that within MUFON. I wanted to show that you can be a positive influence, and can get things done. Children and youth are able to come up with more ways of do- ing things than older people. We are not afraid to try things that are new and different, hence the term \"youth- ful\". During my crusade to accomplish the seem- ingly possible task of youth involvement, I obviously came across some rough seas. At this point, I asked for some help from the adult UFO community. When various people contacted me to express their willing- ness to participate and help, they seemed enthusiastic and \"ready, willing, and.able\" to assist me. As time went on, however, and I called upon these individuals for their assistance, they were \"too busy\"or \"not able to come to the phone.\" It is my firm belief that these \"mature, responsible\" people thought that I was just trying to form a little \"middle school club.\" Little did they know that I truly cared about the program, and still do. Anyone, who wishes to gain more information about this matter from me, may contact me via e-mail Abductee profile? By Ted Davis I would like to respond to the article by Chris Styles, \"Why no consensus on a psychological fea- ture?\" (July, 1998, pp. 17-18). Mr. Styles questions why no researchers are looking for a psychological marker in those who claim to have been abducted by the occu- pants of a UFO. While his suggestion is a good one, the example he gives is poor. Criminal profiling, which is commonly used today with success, is done on an individual ba- sis. There are no blanket profiles for all killers or serial-killers. If only a single profile were necessary, criminals would be much easier to catch. It is also much easier to profile those who demonstrate deviant be- havior, which abductees largely do not. Mr. Styles claims that he has the right to ques- tion the work of abduction researchers even though it is not his area of expertise. While this is true, I ask that he do some research himself before he asks such a question. He comes close to simulating the argument of the \"skeptics\" by critiquing something he has not investigated. He refers to many abduction cases as \"...bogus stories of fantasy-prone attention seekers...\" Accusations such as this only serve to perpetu- ate a myth. I know of no documented cases of abduc- tion hoaxing for attention seeking, or any other pur- pose, and I'm sure the top researchers in the field would tell you the same. Furthermore, the notion that abductees are fantasy-prone was disproved by Spanos et. al. (1) in their 1993 study. These abductees were self-selected by answering an advertisement in the lo- cal newspaper. Therefore, one would expect them to be of the \"fantasy-prone attention seeking\" variety Mr. Styles refers to. Yet these abductees tested less fantasy-prone than the control group. - With respect to the issue of a psychological marker, research has existed for more than a decade which answers some of Mr. Styles' concerns. In 1982, Dr. Elizabeth Slater (2) conducted a blind (she was unaware that what these individuals had in common was abduction experiences) battery of psychological tests on 9 abductees. What she found (aside from there being no consistent psychopathology to explain the cases) was that the abductees had consistent deficits: 1. They had a weakness in the sense of iden- tity and their physical selves or body, \" 2. Especially concerning sexual issues. 3. They had interpersonal difficulties. A"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal September 1998 Page 15 ix 4. These difficulties could be manifest in inter- personal hyper vigilance or excessive mistrust. Additionally, research currently underway by Budd Hopkins and myself will further address the is- sues raised by Mr. Styles in the next few years. In the meantime, Mr. Styles would do himself and the rest of Ufology a great favor by examining the work of others before criticizing it. (I for one would never question the work he has done on the Shag Harbor case without thoroughly researching it myself first.) We have enough problems with unfounded criticism from the outside. We certainly don't need it from the inside. References: 1. Spanos, N. P., Cross, P. A., Dickson, K., & DuBreuil, S. C. (1993). Close encounters: An examination of UFO experiences.

Are hybrids impossible? By Malcolm Smith Living on the other side of the ocean, I receive my copies of the Journal a couple of months late. I hope this does not prevent me from responding to the review of Dr. Jacobs' The Threat in the April 1998 is- sue. One of ufology's problems is that it seems to have few consultants in the field of zoology. So as one with two degrees in the field, let me say a few words. All living creatures on earth are related. Despite their very different appearance, your pet dog or cat has the same fundamental structure as you. Its organs and yours are merely variations on a theme. Your biochemical makeups are variations on a theme. Its genetic code is identical to yours. Indeed, although the genetic code is purely arbitrary, it is the same in every earthly crea- ture. Yet no one would suggest you could hybridize a dog and a human-not even with in vitro fertilisation. A host of factors prevent hybridization between all but very closely related species. So how can anyone expect a hybrid between a human and even the most humanlike alien? Its organs would be constructed on a totally different pattern to anything on earth. Its biochemical profile would be quite different. Its DNA code would be different from ours- assuming that it uses DNA in its genetic processes at all. Even something as simple as hybridizing cells, or inserting an alien gene into a human cell line, would be impossible. In a cell with a different genetic code, the alien gene could not produce the chemical it was coded to produce. We may not know the ultimate secrets of sub-atomic particles and unified fields, but we have a pretty good idea of what living flesh is capable of. So abduction researchers, please write this in large letters above your desks: Faster than light travel may be possible. Te- lepathy may be possible. But interplanterary hybrids are out of the question. Period. No matter what they look like, Jacobs' \"hybrids\" are not true hybrids, and whatever the purpose of the aliens' bizarre genetic experiments might be, interplanetary hybridization is not one of them. Temporal lobe epilepsy By Dr. Alan Vaughan R. J. Durant's interesting hypothesis that tem- poral lobe epilepsy might account for Strieber's first-person contacts with aliens overlooks an impor- tant test of the hypothesis. A recent study (J. Spottiswoode, E. Tauboll, M. Duchowny, V. Neppe, 1997) demonstrates with more than 4000 seizures from 22 epileptic patients that the seizures occur significantly more often (p = .007) on days of higher global geo- magnetic activity than on the day prior. So a statistical test could easily be done if the geomagnetic activity of the days of the alien encounters are compared with that of the days prior. In collaboration with Peter Guttilla and assisted by James Spottiswoode, I have made such an analysis of the sighting times of alien encounters, including ab- ductions (from Hatch, 1996). Multiple-witness alien sightings occur significantly more often during times of lower geomagnetic activity than days prior (Vaughan & Guttilla, 1998). Single-witness sightings show only an insignificant tendency for occurring on days of lower geomagnetic activity. This data gives significant evi- dence against the hypothesis than alien abductions are hallucinations caused by epileptic seizures. Our research, however, would not answer the specific question of Strieber's single-witness alien en- counters. Only an analysis of his particular data will do that. References: L. Hatch. (1996).

Downing The June 1998 issue of the Journal reported that Monsignor Corrado Balducci of the Vatican has said on Italian television that UFOs are real. The July issue of the Journal suggests that some aspects of the original article were misleading, But Balducci is a Catholic theologian with interest in UFOs; that is clear. Whitley Strieber, in his book, Confirmation: The Hard Evidence of Aliens Among Us (1998), in- cludes an appendix, \"An interview with Monsignor Corrado Balducci of the Congregation for the Evange- lization of Peoples and Propagation of the Faith, The Vatican.\" [Strieber has long been interested in the reli- gious dimension of UFOs, in part due to his Roman Catholic background. See my Journal articles, \"Holy Communion?\" April 1987, and \"Strieber and the God Hypothesis,\" November 1988.] The Balducci interview was originally con- ducted by Michael Hesemann, editor of Magaiin 2000. The translation published by Strieber was made by Matthias Schubnell, Ph.D. UFOs are real What is interesting for most MUFON mem- bers is the firmness with which Balducci believes UFOs are real. Balducci says, \"UFOs exist, there's no ques- tion about that; nobody can deny it any more.\" The basis for this is simply widespread eyewitness human testimony. We dare not question human testimony too much, says Balducci; otherwise we will \"question the testimony of Christ's existence.\" (p. 272) Unlike my own position, however, Balducci does not expect UFOs to have revolutionary implica- tions for Christianity. When asked how to interpret UFOs theologically, he responded, \"I would prefer to speak of a human interpretation and not of the theol- ogy.\" He goes on to say, \"The explanations of the UFO research should be sought in this world or, to put it more succinctly, in science and not in the world of an- gels or the Virgin Mary or the demons. The phenom- ena should be explained from within themselves. That is why scientific progress is very important. Each indi- vidual event should be thoroughly examined, not as a miracle, but as something supernatural; not as a divine or demonic incident, but as physical reality, as part of nature.\" (pp. 272-4) [My italics: I suspect there is a translator's er- ror here. I believe the translation should be \"not as something supernatural.\" Whitley Strieber is quoted in the July issue of the Journal as saying Monsignor Ralducci \"personally read and agreed with every de- tail of the translation, and it is completely accurate.\" (p. 20) Be that as it may, I believe the word \"but,\"rather than \"not,\" totally reverses the point Balducci is mak- ing.] A layer of insulation Balducci of course has the right to suppose that we can separate out UFOs as strictly a scientific prob- lem, and not confuse UFOs with something supernatu- ral. Most scientific UFO researchers would applaud this approach. With the exception of UFO cult leaders like the late Marshall Applewhite, most religious lead- ers try to put a layer of insulation between UFOs and traditional Christianity-and ultimately this may prove justified. But as an operating assumption, I believe it unwise. Balducci argues that UFOs should be treated as natural objects, and as such should not impact the supernatural world of Christianity. Protestants have had their own form of insulation. Liberal Protestant lead- ers have been very slow to admit UFOs are real, even though they would be the first to say \"you cannot trust the government.\" Liberal Protestants have been happy to trust the government on this one. For Liberal Prot- estants there is no supernatural. Reports of miracles in the Bible (the parting of the Red Sea, the resurrection of Jesus) are myth, and modern UFOs are likewise myth. Liberal Protestants are happy to confine religion and UFOs to the psychic world of Jungian archetypes. Protestant Fundamentalists, who still have not adjusted to Darwin, are not ready to admit UFOs exist as extraterrestrials, but when they do admit UFOs are real, UFOs are called demons. Thus Protestant Funda- mentalists are willing to have UFOs belong to the world of the supernatural (unlike Balducci), but it is only the negative supernatural-the demonic. Protestant Fundamentalists—unlike Protestant, liberals, believe in miracles. They believe the Red Sea parted, and that Jesus was raised from the dead. They believe-just because it is in the Bible, and the Bible can't be wrong. By calling UFOs- demonic, Fundamentalistm keep a layer of insulation between biblical UFOs and our modern UFOs. UFOs and religion without insulation My approach to UFOs and the biblical religion, as argued in The Bible and Flying Saucers and in many articles published by MUFON, does not presume that we can be sure any insulation separates UFOs and the biblical faith. We cannot assume that the \"pillar of cloud and of fire\" that led Moses and Israel during the Exo- dus was supernatural. Nor can we assume it was not. We cannot assume that modern UFOs are supernatu- ral, nor that they are not. We cannot assume modern UFOs were involved in developing biblical faith, nor"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal September 1998 Page 17 can we assume they were not. Although I believe his arguments could be more carefully made, I think R.L. Dione has asked an im- portant question: Is God Supernatural? The 4,000-Year Misunderstanding (1976). His basic question deals with wondering how we would distinguish between the supernatural and the supertechnological. Theology has never wondered about this because in biblical times a chariot wheel was advanced technology (Ezekiel de- scribed his UFO as a wheel within a wheel). A supernatural world? If George Washington were to come back to life today, our whole world would look supernatural to him. We have made this technological leap in two hundred years. In a universe that is 15 billion years old, how might the technology of a civilization a million years ahead of us look? Might it not appear supernatural? The approach that I have taken to UFOs and Christianity is this: we need to wonder a lot more, and not shut ourselves off from possibilities. I applaud Mon- signor Balducci for coming to the conclusion that UFOs are real. In light of the fact that Pope John Paul II apolo- gized in 1992 for the way the Roman Catholic Church treated Galileo, I know there is Catholic hope that the church will give science the freedom to do its work without worrying that the faith will be jeopardized by scientific discovery. But my own view is that faith without risk is not faith. I do not think we can hide our faith in a safe place. In the parable of the sower, Jesus made it clear that when a farmer sows, he takes risks: that the birds will eat some of the seed, that some seed will fall on rocky ground, that weeds will choke out some seed. Whether it be stock market investments or marriage, we are all in favor of risk reduction. But serious faith can never be risk free. Risks and UFOs Almost all UFO researchers, especially those with professional positions, have taken risks for their faith in UFOs. They have taken these risks because they believe the quest for truth matters. There are in- deed risks involved in mixing UFOs, and Christianity. Marshall Applewhite's gravestone could bear that epi- taph. But from my point of view, one does not stop sowing seeds because one is afraid of the weeds. I do not think we need any ideological separation between religion and UFOs at this time. Such an ideology only gets in the way of truly open research. We need to believe that research and patience- including perhaps waiting for the UFO reality to choose to reveal its nature more clearly to us-will lead ulti- mately to the truth. And we do not need insulation to protect us from the truth, either from the point of view of science or religion.

Antonio Huneeus MUFON International Coordinator Col. Colman S. von Keviczky (1909-98), the internationally prominent ufologist and Hungarian mili- tary scientist, passed away July 27 in New York City, where he had lived since 1952. He was 88 years old, and had a long productive life before succumbing to cancer. The memorial service was held on July 30 at the Hungarian Reformed Church in Manhattan, at- tended by his wife Yolanda, his son Attila, and dozens of members of both the local Hungarian community and NY area ufologists. It's difficult for rrie to write his obituary. I knew him for some 20 years and was personally very close to \"Colman bacsi\" (Uncle Colman), as Hungarians called him affectionately. One could say, in fact, that he was my UFO mentor when I took my first tentative steps in the UFO field 21 years ago. Some, no doubt, will think his long-held hypothesis of a UFO \"galactic task force earthbound operation\" is controversial. Colman pioneered the idea that Star Wars (SDI or mis- sile defense program) was aimed at the aliens long before the recently deceased Col. Corso put it in his Roswell book. But those who knew Colman loved his good-natured, expansive personality and his deep dedi- cation and conviction towards UFO research. Colman's life can be divided roughly into two periods: the first devoted to his military career in Hun- gary, and the second to UFOs from his home base in Queens, New York, with access to a worldwide net- work that stretched from North and South America to Europe and the Far East. He was in fact less known in the USA than in many other countries, particularly Hungary and Japan, where some of his \"UFO memoranda\" was published as commercial books. Most of his work consisted in these Memoranda (reports of 150 or so pages with many original military documents) privately published and distributed by his own organization ICUFON (In- tercontinental U.F.O. Galactic Spacecraft Research and Analytic Network), founded by him in 1966. It was at his typically small New York City ICUFON office full of ufological goodies that I met over the years a number of researchers from all over the world, such as Michael Hesemann of Germany, Bruce Cathie of New Zealand, Johsen Takano of the Cosmo Isle Hakui Museum in Japan, Thierry Pinvidic from France (now a skeptic of the socio-psychological school), the late New York City police detective Pete Mazzola, founder of the SBI, Peter Robbins, co-author of the Bentwaters book Left At East Gate, and count Col. Colman von Keviczky less others. I myself brought to his office many ufologists from Russia, Spain, Argentina, Japan, and even India. Colman was one of the must-see stops for any ufologist visiting New York, a permanent fixture of our local scene, always there, always willing to show what he used to call \"genuine official evidences.\" He used to appear periodically at UFO press conferences organized by publicist Mike Luckman of the New York Center for UFO Research (NYCUFOR). Colman was really an idealist from another era, born Aug. 21, 1909, in the final days of the dual Austro-Hungarian Hapsburg monarchy. He studied at the historical Ludovica Royal Hungarian Military Uni- versity in Budapest, graduating in 1932 as a first lieu- tenant with a Master of Military Science and Engineer- ing (MMSE). Promoted to major in 1938, he was the founder and chief of the Audio-Visual Military Educa- tion Department at the Royal Hungarian Army Gen- eral Staff until 1945. After the war, Colman worked for the 3rd U.S. Army Constabulary in Heidelberg, Germany, as mo- tion picture director, cameraman, and public relations officer until 1952, when he emigrated to the United States. It was also the great American flying saucer wave of 1952 which \"alerted my military eye,\" as Colman used to say, and so he began collecting UFO reports and photos. Although he was an American citizen for many years, Colman's military rank was officially recognized by the postcommunist Hungarian government, which gave him a retroactive promotion to full colonel. He was also a member of the American Institute of Aero-"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal September 1998 Page 19 nautics and Astronautics (AIAA). Colman lectured at many international UFO Congresses in the U.S., Mexico, Brazil, Japan, Ger- many, Austria, Hungary and several other European nations. He was invited by the late Lord Clancarty to speak at the House of Lords UFO Study Group in 1980, briefed the president of Austria, Dr. Rudolph Kirchljggtr, in 1983; and also lectured at the Dag Hammjrjskold Auditorium in the United Nations in 1987. He himself worked at the UN Public Infor- mation Office in the 1960s, where he was the very first to attempt to bring the UFO issue to the United Nations. Secretary-General U Thant was actually fa- vorably disposed toward the subject. \"In February of 1966,1 sent a memorandum to Secretary-General U Thant, indicating that the UN should coordinate some kind of [UFO] project,\" Colman told me during our first recorded interview in 1979. \"The high authorities had certain prejudices about UFO people. Nevertheless, through a media li- aison, the Secretary-General contacted me personally and assigned me to establish an analytical group within the Secretariat.\" Unfortunately, that initiative never took off- it was opposed by the U.S. UN Mission, and Colman maintained that eventually it cost him his UN job. Undaunted, he formed ICUFON and went on writing memoranda addressed to the United Nations, the White House, members of Congress, and anybody who would listen. Occasionally, some did. \"The magazine pre- sents some interesting concepts concerning the exist- ence of extraterrestrials,\" wrote Col. Edwin Patterson, assistant dean of the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, thanking Colman for a copy of his detailed military analysis of the famous October 1973 UFO flap across North America, published in a special is- sue of Official UFO magazine in 1975. And when Colman sent Prof. Hermann Oberth, the German inventor of rocketry, the draft of his International Space Security Pact-Space Law in 1966, regulating how mankind should deal with \"Homo Cosmicus\" in a legal global way, Prof. Oberth wrote him: \"Your proposals seem to me to be the only logical thing we can do in this situation in the case that UFOs are strange spaceships indeed. By the way, I think the first step will be made by the Uranides.\" The term \"Uranides\" was coined by Oberth from the Greek word Ouranos for sky, thus Sky People, while von Keviczky coined the Latin term \"Homo Cosmicus\" (Cosmic Man). Nor was Colman at all shy in confronting any- one about his views. Colman was a prominent mem- ber of the Hungarian-American community and was once part of a delegation that attended a briefing or- ganized by the Reagan White House at the adjacent Old Executive House. When the President's science advisor, George Keyworth, was explaining the SDI research program, Colman pointed out with that roar- ing voice he had that \"star wars\" was really aimed against the galactic forces and not the Soviets. The science advisor was not pleased. On another occa- sion he confronted his fellow Hungarian-American, Dr. Edward Teller, the inventor of the H bomb. Colman's thesis took a boost a few years ago when President Reagan made a number of cryptic speeches about how the USA and USSR would unite \"if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world.\" Colman dogged every American president from Richard Nixon to Bill Clinton with various UFO memoranda. Regardless of what one thinks about his ufological ideas, one had to admire the man. He kept in excellent physical and mental health with more energy and dedication than most ufologists I know (including myself), tirelessly pursuing his UFO cru- sade into his late 80's. He was still contributing to the Hungarian UFO magazine just a few weeks before prostate can- cer finally sent him to the hospital. Perhaps now that he has crossed to the other side he has finally learned the truth about UFOs. We will miss him, but his legacy will continue in his memoranda and in the large ICUFON archives and photo collection he amassed during 45 years of UFO research.

The 72-year-old woman commented to her 48-year-old daughter that \"they must be friends of your sister,\" because her sister is inter- ested in the UFO phenomenon. They didn't want to talk about it too much because they were afraid of the whole subject. Swedesboro, NJ-Six hours later at 9:10 p.m., Charles W. and his wife were looking out their bed- room window and saw a UFO with numerous red lights flying just above the trees near an abandoned Nike Missile Base. It had extremely bright quick flashing lights, ap- parently from within the slowly spinning disc. It ap- peared the bright lights were shinning through the craft's windows. Shortly afterward they and their neigh- bors noticed at least two helicopters apparently land- ing at the base. This is the same general area near Mullica Hill where so many sightings have occurred in recent months. Thanks to Evelyn Gaulson and Charles W. Round object in Pennsylvania Stan Gordon reports he received a call on his UFO Hotline from a woman who sounded shaken after ob- serving a strange aerial device on Aug. 3. The woman was inside her home around 12:45 a.m. when she saw red and green lights reflecting off the surface of a lake about fifty feet away. The witness at first thought that there was a thunderstorm. Looking out the window she saw a \"perfectly round\" object with red and green lights hover over the lake. The bottom of the object was lit up. She watched it for about 30 seconds when suddenly it launched straight up. The woman said her two cats were fright- ened and ran out of the room. Several hours previously, Stan also received a re- port from the Pittsburgh area of an object that appeared to explode into many bright fragments. Triangular object in France Stuart Conway, a photographer from Scotland, and a friend reported a very large triangular UFO over Lac de St. Croix, north of Marseilles on the French Medi- terranean coast on June 24. Approximately 30 minutes later, another witness living in Rognac reported an object shaped like a boo- merang coming from the direction of Lac de St. Croix. Other witnesses reported seeing a triangular UFO that same night in the Rognac area.

Webb October 1998 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Jupiter (magnitude -2.8), in Aquarius, gleams brightly in the SE at dusk. The giant world proceeds westward during the night. On the night of Oct. 3-4, the nearly full moon approaches and passes below Ju- piter. The gibbous Moon also lies near the planet on the 31st. Saturn (-0.2), in Pisces, reaches a point opposite the Sun on Oct. 23. At that time the planet rises in the E at sunset and remains visible all night as it moves westward across the sky. It is 2 degrees above the gib- bous Moon on the 6th. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars (1.6), in Leo, rises in the ENE about 3 a.m. in midmonth and is well up in the E by dawn. On Oct. 6 and 7 the reddish planet comes within about I de- gree of the bluish-white star Regulus. The two objects are nearly the same brightness (Regulus is slightly brighter) and make a nice contrasting pair in the sky. Binoculars aid the view. And then on the 15th and 16th, the lunar crescent approaches and passes both Regu- lus and Mars. Jupiter sets in the W about 4 a.m. in midmonth. Saturn sets in the W near sunrise. Meteor Showers: The reliable Orionid meteors peak in a moonless sky toward dawn on Oct. 22. The hourly rate then is about 20 or 25 per hour. The streaks of light appear to radiate from the constellation Orion in the southern sky. Though most Orionids are rather faint, some are bright fireballs. This shower has a double peak-an ear- lier one for its fainter members and a later one for ihe brighter ones. Difficult to predict, there is always the chance the Draconid or Giacobinid meteors may erupt into a brief display numbering in the thousands per hour on or about Oct. 8. The yellowish meteors are relatively slow and emanate from the Dragon Draco high in the NW after dark. Normally producing only about 20 meteors per hour, spectacular displays occurred in 1933 and 1946, while a smaller but worthwhile show (200 per hour) took place in 1985. (The Draconids must not be confused with the upcoming Leonids in November which may also put on a dramatic sky show.) Moon Phases: Full moon-Oct. 5 (Harvest Moon) Last quarter-Oct. 12 New moon-Oct. 20 First quarter-Oct. 28 € The Stars: While the bright stars of the Great Square of Pe- g.isus and the Summer Triangle still rule the upper half ol ihe southern sky, below these star patterns is a very dim region of the heavens called \"The Sea.\" It is a bit of a challenge to find the aquatic constellations (from W to E) of Capricornus the Sea Goat (shaped like a diaper), Aquarius the Water Bearer (the water jug is a small \"Y\"of stars), Piscis Austrinus the Southern Fish (look for the bright white star Fomalhaut), Pisces the Fish (two faint strings of stars converge to form a huge \"V,\" and Cetus the Sea Monster (a sprawling pattern below Pisces).

If by chance one has failed to renew promptly, the missed back issues may be purchased for three U.S. dollars each, provided they are not out-of-print. Local MUFON Meetings The \"grass roots\" organization of MUFON is unique compared to former UFO groups and other present day organizations in the UFO community. This has been our strength and assures our ability to per- form as a field investigator team worldwide. Local group meetings, chapters, section, and state meetings are the vehicles by which UFO information is shared and field investigator training is conducted. One of the more frequent questions that we receive on our MUFON UFO-Hotline number concerns the location and place of MUFON meetings in the caller's area. It is fortunate that local chapter meetings are oc- curring in many major cities. However, as the recipi- ent of these calls, I cannot provide the details, but must refer the caller to the nearest State or State Section Director. In most cases this is satisfactory. On our web-site on the Internet (mufon.com), we now list all of the State Directors, their addresses, and their telephone numbers as references and contacts. We want to expand upon this service by providing a list of the statewide MUFON meetings by date, place, and time they are conducted on a scheduled basis. As an example: the San Antonio, TX, section meets the fourth Tuesday of each month at 7 p.m. at the UTF Bookstore at North Blanco and Oblate Streets. The Austin. TX, section meets on the fourth Saturday of each month at 3 p. m. at the Quarry Library in Northwest Austin off the MOPAC Highway. Every group that meets on a repetitive schedule, whether it is weekly, monthly, bi-monthly, or quarterly, should provide this information to Walt Andrus in Seguin, TX, so such a list may be entered on our web site. This will be an asset to potential new members and especially vacationers who are traveling. At the same time, this could be the motivation to organize regular meetings in places where they are not currently being held. MUFON Membership Versus Local Group Membership In my travels and speaking engagements to MUFON groups, I have polled the audiences and asked a simple straightforward question: \"How many of you are MUFON members?\" Maybe a third or half of the audience responds to this request for a show of hands. I-then follow this question with a second: \"How many of you receive the MUFON UFO Journal in the mail, and do you have a MUFON ID card?\" Surprisingly, a much smaller group responds to the latter question. Why is there a difference in responses to these two questions? When personally queried, some people tell me they consider that if they are members and pay dues to the local group, this makes them members of MUFON International. Since they are not receiving the Journal and do not have a current ID card, it is obvious that they are not truly MUFON members. It becomes the responsibility of the local leader or mem- bership chairman to point this out and actively pro- mote MUFON membership. In some states, such as New Hampshire and North Carolina, the State Director will not permit a person to join the state group until he/she is a certified MUFON member. This undoubtedly explains why Peter Geremia still has the highest percentage of MUFON members compared to the population of the state of New Hampshire. His is number one! A membership campaign should be taking place in the majority of our local groups. Congratulations to Eugene and Jean Brown for having more members in their Tampa-CIearwater, FL, group than any of the major cities in the U.S.A. They must be doing something right! We invite them to write in article for the Journal in order to share their ideas, programs, and techniques with the rest of us.

We have received two candidates' ap- plications for Director of Public Education, and addi- tional applications are still being accepted. MUFON still has a vacancy for Membership Director on the Board to not only devise programs to recruit new mem- bers, but to analyze and reduce the number of mem- bers who are not renewing their annual memberships. Candidates should send their resumes to Walt Andrus in Seguin, TX Change of Address The modern population has a tendency to move frequently due to new jobs and personal reasons. Many of our member/subscribers are missing issues of their Journals when they fail to notify our headquarters of their change in address or even notify their post office. If we have to rely on the post office to advise your new address, they destroy your Journal and send us a noti- fication, charging MUFON 50 cents. Some members are utilizing e-mail for this notification, not realizing that the e-mail does not come directly to our office, creating delays through handling by volunteers across the country such as Robert Coddington, Cynthia Hall, and Tom Deuley. For this purpose, \"snailmail\" (The U.S. Postal Service) is the most reliable and rec- ommended procedure. Membership Renewals The MUFON UFO Journal is mailed second class postage. With nearly 100 post office distribution points in the U.S.A.. the Journals are sorted by ZIP code, placed into individual mail bags, and shipped directly to the ADC distribution center closest to the member's home address. This procedure is a lot more physical work for the headquarters office, but delivery time has been immensely improved in the U.S.A. However, this procedure has not reduced the de- livery time to foreign countries, where it requires two to three months for surface mail to be delivered. Air Mail is highly recommended if you want to receive your Journal promptly, even though there is an added cost. Foreign renewal forms and payments must be sent Air Mail; otherwise you definitely will miss receiving every copy, In addition to the enclosed renewal forms which are reminders that your subscription/membership will expire within a prescribed number of months, one can look two different places for the expiration date or last issue: (1) On the white mailing label, note the date in the lower right corner of the magazine or envelope la- bel. If the numbers 98/09 appear, this means your last issue of the Journal will be September 1998 unless you renew before that date. (2) This same date appears on (Continued on Page 23) X"}]
