FROM THE EDITOR Recently, while film- ing a segment in the mov- ie Mysteries of the Gods, I had the opportunity to spend a few days in can- did conversation with William Shatner, whose own UFO experience in the Mojave Desert trig- gered a tremendous int- erest in the whole field of ufology. I had no real problem answering his technical questions about how math can be applied to the pro- blem of UFOs, but I had a very difficult time try- ing to explain why this field is so fragmented & 'political as opposed,say, to the movie industry. I knew it was not as much a matter of approach as it was-of personalities. I knew how much lack of funds hampered signifi- cant research. But to try to make a professional such as Shatner, who was used to million dollar budgets and highly co- ordinated efforts,under- stand the problems of UFO research was a very difficult task. He kept asking \"Why has there been no real progress after JO years of try- ing? Where is the evi- dence?\" . All I could say was that the UFO pro- blem was only recently beginning to be handled in any scientifically or- ganized manner, that there was a long, rough road yet to be traveled before we say what UFOs represented. But as I talked with him, I secretly wished that Captain Kirk was at the bridge directing our united efforts, and the resources of the Enter- prise were somehow avail- able to all of us.

This is because in our number is found the same fragmentation inherent in any group with an in- tangible goal. Basically, there is a left, right and center to us. We can also label ourselves moderates, liberals and radicals if we wish to be specific. However, few clear- cut lines of distinction separate these areas. The following are but suggestions. Conservatives have not been included because they would be non-believers. The few moderates in our midst could be said to accept UFOs as strictly nuts-and-bolts machines. They would probably not go beyond accepting conventional earthly explanations for UFO origins. These people never get in- volved in UFO affairs because there is no need to get worked up. In the large, broad middleland of ufology reside the liberals. Most of the organizations, formal and otherwise, come from this sector. It is the mainstay of the field, and most of us have several ties to it. It is packed with talent and energy. Here the general belief is that UFOs are real har- dware, that they are extra- terresterial, that they come in a multitude of types and kinds, and that they are piloted by several different being types. The aliens may reach Earth by conventional travel or by \"warping\" into Ear- thside. They may have first come here at primordial light or 24 June 1947: On the extreme left is the radical bunch. No foal order here. Usually lead by magazine and book writers, the concept \"UFO\" can have any meaning or im- plication that the mind can en- tertain. However, from the ranks of the liberals come an increasingly strong disagreement with these explanations and even with their basis for being made. Some ob- jections can be traced to a growing bewilderment within this group as they see well-known men, solid liberals before, aban- doning their positions to takeup those of the radicals. To those still in the ranks, it is as if these men have deserted the cause entirely, rather than to have moved the firing-line forward. Questions are heard: Why do you do it? For the money? For the sensationalism? Do they know something we don't? Are they being made to do these things? Or what? A simple answer is not hard to find. These men are the talk of ufology because they place no limit on what they will accept about UFOs. When enough cases indicate that the UFOs have acquired a new dimension (perhaps literally) they tackle it with the best of their abilities. Safe liberal niche be damned. Those liberals who remain to complain of the new develop- ments and ideas are stagnating themselves and the UFO search. According to a Gallup Poll in 1950, only three per cent of Americans believed UFOs were alien machines. Results of a 1973 Gallup Poll tend to indicate that the percentage of believers has in- creased ten-fold. We talk about the advancement of the public mind toward UFOs, but what about advancements oin the com- mon mind of ufology? Without us being aware, a large percentage of Americans have caught up with ufology—see how the media presses run—and they now share our major beliefs about UFOs. Today's liberal, the radical of yesterday, is no longer living on the ragged-edge, subject to being a \"laughingstock\" at every turn. He has forgotten what it's like to be explaining phenomena most others refuse to take seriously. Ufology cannot lead public awareness if it sets back to wait for the masses to crown it with laurals. Public be damned. We must do it for ourselves first. To move on, strongly on, requires no limits on what we can, must, or should think about UFOs. Any limits are self-imposed and display prejudicial attitudes and beliefs. Limiting thinking is a self- defeating, frustrating manner of solving the mysteries of the Universe. Sometimes in our smugness we forget a major point. —We don't know anything about UFOs as a fact. All we know is pure con- jecture. We have mouthed this conjecture to each other for so long that it has become accepted. Accepted conjecture becomes pseudo-fact after awhile when it always seems to fit the cir- cumstances. The one thing we cannot do is to allow ourselves to believe that we need not consider alternative suggestions that threaten to break whole strings of strung-together \"facts.\" When strong, new suggestions appear from a need to explain additional phenomena, we should be especially attentive to our house of cards. Our concept \"UFO\" is not so sacred that it cannot, need not, change or be totally destroyed. And we have job enough to do, each in our dif- ferent ways, without resorting to infighting."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Huge Globe Sucks Up Water from Bay in Hokaido, Japan by Jun-Ichi Tkanashi (Chairman, MODERN SPACE FLIGHT ASSOCIATION) Hokkaido is the northermost district of Japan, where UFO sightings occur most frequently and in the more drastic and in- teresting fashions than in the other districts. During July 1974, we have received a very intriguing UFO report from an unacquainted university student by way of a let- ter. He was not a resident in Hokkaido but a 2nd grade student of a university in Kanto District (central district of Japan com- prising seven prefectures, in- cluding Tokyo), but when he had been working during his previous summer vacations as a Night Guardman at a lumberyard there, he had had a startling and very eerie experience, which he wan- ted to report. The exact location of the ex- perience is Tomakomai, a small industrial town on the southern coast of Hokkaido, and as the student prefers to remain anonymous, we will call him Mr. Masaaki Kudou, and he was 20 years old at that time and his eyesights of both eyes are 1.2. The incident occurred at around 1:30 a.m. in the early morning of one day in July near the eastern wharf of Tomakomai City. His story follows: It was during July 1973, but I do not remember exactly what day it was. As the school broke up for summer, I had returned back to . my native place, Hokkaido, and had been working as night guard- man at the lumberyard there. Although the job was executed by car, the lumberyard at night is a very desolate and lonely place, with only a few dark warehouses 4 and chimneys in the distance. As the night watch was done by oneself alone, it was not a pleasant feeling that one gets when left there alone. After making the round of the lumberyard, I returned my car to the prescribed place, switched on the car radio, lit the cigarette, and I was looking up at the clear night sky absent-mindedly through the driver's window, relaxing in the seat, when suddenly a streak of light ran across the sky. But, as the light went out im- mediately, I thought it might be a shooting star, when the light re- appeared at the very spot where it had went out, just in the same fashion as a miniature bulb was switched on, and then it began to expand itself, by making the small scale contractions and ex- pansions alternatively in an ex- treme rapidity, arriving at the size of a baseball at the end. It looked like to be in such size by my naked eyes, but it might have been much larger, as I sup- pose it was in the far distance. I felt as if my heart would ex- plode, and then felt my hairs stood on ends, but after an instant of ex- treme surprise, although I was aware that I was still in the grip of big fear, I was making the frantic efforts to chase the movements of the UFO. The light moved to and fro in all directions within the limit of one meter visually. I had decided then and there to continue to watch the maneuvers of the UFO, suppressing my big excitement. Suddenly it began to make the descent with a spiral motion, and having come down to the altitude just above the dome of a cement factory, which was visible in the far distance, it began to send out what appeared to be intermittent green light rays in one direction, which I supposed to be north. As the scene was too science- fiction like, I wished what I had been observing proved to be a dream or my imagination, but in spite of my such wishing, the UFO would not dare to stop its action. After having stopped its strange 'signaling', it began to descend over the waters of the bay, describing a big arch with a star- tling speed. As fortunately the bay waters could be seen from where my car was located, I could see all that happened further there. I had realized at that time that the distance of the light was rather near to me. The light descended to the altitude just about 20 meters from the surface of the water and stop- ped, and then (I am positive that you can not believe my words from now on!) from the underside of the light came down what ap- peared to be a glass-like tran- sparent tube and when the front edge of that tube touched the sur- face of the water, that part of the tube began to glow and appeared to be sucking up the bay water! Accompanying the elongation of the tube, I heard a faint sound, just like the sound of a cicada, especially of the kind which emits the sound like, \"Min-Min-Min- Min...\", but the sound was not so monotonous and appeared to be lowering its pitch... I was stupefied and suddenly I felt myself like an idiot! After dropping my head down-"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Flew to north. • . „ jj Appeared again. . , ,.   • Spiralled down. r 'Vanished Appeared first here. ' Flew in arc.

And then the light began to fly again and began to approach me—and when I realized that it was heading to the point just about 50 meters above my head, I was frightened and felt more dead than alive! The simple feeling I was assaulted by at that moment was that I would be attacked and killed by that object! The size of the object was now about the size of a volleyball. The intensity of the light had now diminished, compared with it in the distance (or it might have seemed so as the surroundings were lit up by its light like the daylight time and the object's more detailed appearance became apparent (He later says that its surface was as smooth as the surface of a ping pong ball and appeared to be white, and that although not so bright, it was glowing by itself.—JIT.) and was emitting the whitish colour rather than the orange colour. Then I saw with my own eyes a row of what looked like small win-' doWs going around the center of the object, which was round, and in one of the central ones, I saw one and in another just two win- , dows right, I saw two, errie shadow-like figures', which were too small and deformed to be called the shadows of th men! When I caught sight of that strange spectacle, although I was fully conscious that the object was just over my head, I remember I began to groan with my head resting against the steering wheel between my hands, emitting the soundless cry! No, I may have been ex- periencing the excruciating pain at that moment, as I remember that I had been feeling at that time as if I was bound hand and foot. But, still I tried to see the object by my own eyes and then saw in the positions slightly oblique from just over my head three or four other objects which were very similar to the original ones. To my further terror, however, I saw just beside them what appeared to be three gasoline drums con- nected together longwise, which was hovering there noiselessly in blackish, dark brown silouette. Then suddenly, all the glowing balls, 4 or 5 in all, were sucked in- to the huge drum-like object and the object began to move and rush, and disappeared into the northern sky, with the splendid speed like a snooting star... I still remember that as this terrifying experience receded away from me at that time, I began to feel my whole body numb, just as after we sit for long time for a yogi practice. It was then that I perceived that my car radio was emitting meaningless sounds and at the same time, I felt my head aching heavily. The duration of the experience, although it was felt very long at 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"the time, may have been only 11- 12 minutes. I could not sleep that night after. this terrifying ex- perience and I was only eager to be replaced by other man at the dawn of the morning and waited it most impatiently.... (End of his story)' You may understand im- mediately why this incident is particularly interesting to us: Because there are a few detailed cases in UFO history where UFO sucked up water through the 'pipe' which it elongated down from its underside. One occurred' on a sunny July morning in 1965 in British .Columbia, Canada, where a geologist and exploration manager of a mining company, Mr. John Hembling, and his com- panion geologist saw a mushroom shaped object descended to less than 50 feet above a small glacial lake and lowered a pipe-like in- strument from its underside and dipped it into the water, and remained in such style for about 8 minutes before withdrawing it ,and flew away. (See: Canadian UFO Report, Vol. 1, No. 3, May- June, 1969 PP.. 4-6) Another oc- curred in the afternoon of April 9, -1970, ,on ; a south German country road near Langenschemmern, Wurttemberg, where a retired electrician., named Max Krauss, aged 65, saw a small transparent ball with the diameter of some 40 cm and containing eight spokes projecting from its dark nucleus, which had been floating along behind him for ; some 150 meters, stopped at one side of the road and .elongated a -hose-pipe' from'its inside and dipped its front edge in- to the stream of water formed at the edge of the road by the rain- fall and remained it such.state for a.short while before drawing it up and resuming its moving and .flying away. (See: Flying Saucer Review, Vol. 18, No. 4, July- August 1972 PP. 15-17) If anyone knows the similar case or cases, please kindly enlighten me. MUFON IN JAPAN To provide better coverage of - UFO; events in Japan, MUFON has restructured its organization there. MUFON Director for Japan, with overall respon- sibility, will be Jun-Ichi Takanashi (Modern Space Flight Association, 2-7-12, Yuuhigaoka, Toyondka, Osaka, Japan 560). Mr. Takanashi, a leading expert .on UFOs and author of several books, also serves as a MUFON Information Center to copy and transmit reports and documents to serious researchers in Japan. ; Copies of reports, documents, and newspaper clippings may be sent to him at the above address. Mr. Masaru Mori, science fic- tion author and serious student of scientific matters, has been ap- pointed Sectional Director for Northern Japan, responsible for MUFON representation in Tokyo and ,the Hokkaido Islands, Mr. Mori visited MUFON headquar- ters in Seguin, Texas, during May 1976. Mr Takao Ikeda, electrical engineer, will serve as Sectional Director, for Southern Japan, covering the area outside of Tokyo, Shikoku, and Kyushu Islands. By Richard Hall A circular UFO that seemed to respond to light signals badly frightened a.., witness near Causses, France, September 8, , 1974. The case was reported by Ouranos (No. 14, 2nd Quarter 1975), investigated by M. A. Grazzioli and M. De Cordova.' Returning from Cessenon-sur- Causses in their car about 10:30 PM, Mr. & Mrs. M. noticed an odd orange and red light which disappeared when they went to investigate it. Returning to their original vantage point, they saw the light reappear. Puzzled, they stopped the car and observed that the light was blinking on and off approximately every two minutes. The sky was cloudy with a low overcast, and a strong wind from the south. Suddenly the light became more intensive, illuminating the surrounding sky, and a luminous globe lifted up from behind a hill. Its light dimmed almost to the point of disappearance, and brightened again several times. Mrs. M. became frightened so Mr. M. took her home and returned to the scene alone, positioning himself on the highest hill near the village. The object was still there. Mr. M. blinked his headlights at the UFO a couple of times, and the object suddenly darted toward him at fantastic speed, stopped about 150 m overhead, glowing brightly and emitting a humming sound. Its light illuminated the village. Mr. M. was now very afraid, but the object vanished abruptly without any visible motion, perhaps blinking off its lights. The witness drove to a friend's home and returned with him; both saw the luminous object moving smoothly near the ground, finally . departing upwards. Witnesses reported that the UFO traveled at about 50-60 km/hr, casting an oval-shaped light on the ground. It illuminated the dock, the distillery, and the stadium. Grapevines were seen as clearly as in daylight. \"One witness noted that there were no visible rays between the object and the light on the ground, considered very unusual,\" the Ouranos story said."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MAYDEMA'S MYSTERY LIGHTS A K. Ronerts secretary TUFOIC • • •   .  / (CASE STUDY FROM THE TASMANIAN UFO INVESTIGATION CENTRE - TUFOIC) (Submitted by Paul Jackson; adapted from 'a summary' by K. Roberts, Secretary, Tasmanian UFO In- vestigation Centre, Australia). Location of town Maydena, the location of a num- ber of sightings between February and April 1976, is situated 58kms NW from Hobart as the crow flies. The town of several hundred people is the cen- ter of logging operations for the Australiun Newsprint-Mills. Maydena.itself is in the Tayen- na River valley at an elevation of some 280mts. To the north is Mt. Field National Park, a high coun- . try area of lakes and peaks up to 1400mts. There are of course ex- tensive areas of forest around the town, public access to the same is by permit only. The new power lines from the Lake Pedder/Gordon power scheme pass over the Maydena Range a few miles to the south. The two new large lakes are roughly SOkms to the west and southwest. : Sightings Start The Maydena business all star- ted for TUFOIC on the evening of February 17th when Wayne Thor- pe telephoned the President Jeanette Bigwood only minutes after sighting two puzzling lights at 10:15 p.m. Thorpe and his friends went in search of the lights but were un- successful. Their report plus an account of a possible meteorite sighting in the Hobart Mercury resulted in a flood of sightings to theCentre. Thorpe with 3 friends had first noticed two orange lights moving fast from the direction of National Park (approx. from NE'). The lights, one following the other, slowed as they moved over the Mayderi Range, then eventually stopped altogether. The lights were viewed by. binoculars but just appeared as bigger lights. An apparent size of lOc was given by witnesses. After'remaining still for a few minutes ( one of the lights (the leading'light) dropped in front of the range towards some rough clearings above Fitzgerald about 3:miles distant. The light looked bigger as it came down but then just went out as it neared the ground or went behind trees into a gully. At this same moment the second light above went up and off like a light being turned off. Repeat Performance Two Nights Later On the subsequent field trip to Maydena, Mr. A. Walker reported seeing the lights doing the same performance two nights later about 10 p.m. He also called his . wife out to see the lights. Once again two orange lights smaller than Ic sized were seen moving slowly from the NE, almost drifting said Mr. Walker. The lights appeared low as they moved in front of the Maydena Range over Fitzgerald. The two lights, side by side, then became stationary for 2 to 3 minutes. Again one light started to move down; the other up and away. It took 3 minutes for the light to near the ground but Mr. Walker couldn't tell if it landed or not as it faded out at the top of a clearing. At the same time the second light kept moving up and also just went out. CROWD SEES UFOS FLY PAST : . The first of the UFO fly pasts over the Maydena township itself occurred on the night of February 21st/22nd. Men leaving the RSL Club at the eastern end of the town first noticed two orange/red lights moving towards the west over Ab- botts L.O. Other people at various locations in the town also sighted the lights. Mrs. P. Green who takes- weatherjeadings at the town, saw the lights from outside a friend's house at the western end of Maydena. She was waiting for a lift home. She noticed the lights, one above the other, moving west over the Look Out, the lower.light at one stage seemed to be beneath : the hilline. She called out her friends to look for themselves. She said there was no noise ; as the lights moved slowly along. They dipped and then rose again at one point. One witness though said they could hear a faint humming sound. Geoff Marshall told the Centre how the lights had disappeared. He had seen them come from the Abbotts L.O. area and-gradually close .together. Originally the lights had been separated by quite some distance, but met up south- west of the town. Descriptions varied on what happened next. Some people men- tioned seeing a flash; others thought the lights dulled then brightened. The next things said Marshall was that one of the lights moved off fast to the southwest, going out 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"of sight over the skyline. The remaining light drifted westward a short distance and up a bit before it also faded out. The lights had been seen beneath scattered cloud and described as various sizes from three times Venus to V 2 inch ap- parent. They were described by all as orange/reddish and were in view for some 20 minutes or more between 11:50p.m. to 12:20p.m. One resident said her Sanyo Two Band Radio had failed to pick up local stations since the fly over and now would only emit a beeping noise at one position on the tun ing dial. Another Report That Night A similar Ic sized orange light put in an appearance on the Sun- day evening (22nd) at 10:15 10:15 p.m. It was only seen for 2 minutes as it traveled westward in the southern sky. The light was at a higher elevation than the previous night's sighting and moving faster. One witness had a quick look with binoculars at the light and thought there was a dome shape on top of the light. The light just blinked out in a clear sky. Second Multiple Sighting It was a cloudy night on Wed- nesday, February 25th, but this didn't deter the two orange lights,. one above the other, from putting in yet another appearance. Numerous witnesses spotted the lights from the town at 10:15 p.m. Geoff Marshall recalled that he first noticed.the nocturnal lights as they came through a gap in the Range by Abbotts Look Out. They seemed to be beneath the misty sky. This would place the lights 2 or 3 miles off and 2500 ft. above the town. The. reddish/orange lights moved in perfect formation but at a slower speed to the last report on the Sunday night (22nd). The lights were in sight for 5 minutes and after heading west, turned 8 southwest and gained elevation. They faded and possibly could have climbed into the overcast. During investigations into all the Maydena reports the Centre ruled out aircraft. Also a check was made with the RAAF but they had no exercises on at the time of any sightings. Balloons were eliminated, as a number of repor- ts had the lights moving into the winds, the Weather Bureau balloon never being in this area, plus the fact its battery-operated white light only lasts 15 minutes at the most and a spokesman said it was not visible above four to five thousand feet. THE NIGHTTHEY RANG THE CHURCH BELL \"Hundreds watch UFOs at Maydena\" reported the Hobart Mercury on February 28th, referring to yet another multiple witness report on February 26th. Then it recounted how the church bell had been rung at the ap- proach of the familiar orange/red lights. As a result, there were groups of 30 to 40 people clustered in side streets and a bigger crowd in the main street. The lights which were first seen at 10:55 p.m. were seen for nearly 20 minutes as they traveled towards the west then .swung south or southwest and disappeared into the distance. On the ensuing field trip to the town there .were just too many witnesses for the in- vestigators to see in the limited time available. This time the lights appeared as if climbing out of the valley towar- ds National Park and were on a flight path to take them almost over Maydena's main street. The first light was in a steep climb and was followed within 5 to 10 secon- ds by its companion. The second light,.however, was on a much lower trajectory. , Constable Lowry takes up the story. He heard the church bell ringing and went out to see the two lights approaching from the northeast, he saw a silver light fall from the leading light. It drop- ped for 4 seconds then went out. This was noted by others. The second light, on its lower trajectory, gradually closed on the first light. Some thought the leading light slowed to allow it to catch up. The two lights even- tually took up a formation. The second light below the first, they continued their westward movement. Various estimates were given for the apparent size of the lights varying from four times Venus sized up to V 2 inch. All agreed they appeared much larger than on the earlier occasions. A number of residents attempted to take photographs of the lights (to date, it appears none were successful). Others had telescopes and binoculars trained on the lights. Most people just saw larger lights with no extra details. One witness thought he could see on the first light a large half moon light at the front, colored a misty orange. Behind this was an ill-defined squiggly area then a bright orange light at the rear. After passing the town, the lights altered course, a point on which all the witnesses agreed. Then there was mention of a change of positions by the lights, *' or a flash of light, but whatever happened the lights were now ? heading south or southwest as op- 4 posed to their original westward movement. Depending on their location in the town, some people lost sight of the lights before others. Those nearest the hills south of the town had their view obstructed by trees. Geoff Marshall and E. Rumley however went down to the football ground which gave them a better vantage point. One light could be seen receeding into the distance and eventually went out of sight over the skyline about 11:15 to 11:20 p.m. The remaining"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"light had meanwhile become stationary in the southwest sky. Then after some minutes faded out. Members from the Centre paid two visits to Maydena to obtain details on the sightings and view that area in general. A fruitless wait for the appearance of the lights was made over the March long weekend holiday. Mrs. Green and others a mile west of Maydena on the ANM Gate also sighted the lights that night. However, they had moved away southwest and only ap- peared as starlike lights. They did though seem low as nearby trees had blocked their initial view. A fascinating problem with the lights was just where they came from. On all the occasions they approached from the northeast, they were not seen from any other location than Maydena. A line northeast takes one out to the Der- went Valley but the Centre received no reports from the area. It seemed as if the lights just materialized down valley from the town and proceeded on their way. We will see, however, from the next report that a sighting of- the lights going back to: the nor- theast was seen from another location and gives us something of a fix on their location. AFIXONTHE LIGHTS AT LAST Just when everyone thought the lights had gone for good, they returned on the evening of March 10th at 11:10 p.m. For a change they were traveling .southwest to northeast. The witnesses were Mr. G. Sargison and Mr. T. Fran- combe a Forest Operations Superintendent; neither had seen the earlier visits by the lights. Sargison saw the lights first. A lone light was seen coming from the SW and passing north of the town. He called out his neighbor Mr. Francombe; they then picked up a second light following. They were both orange colored. The lights were very bright pin point source of light. Their speed was estimated at about 100 mph. It seemed the lights would be lost from view as they approached a cloud bank to the north. However, the lights passed beneath the clouds which had a base about IGOOmts. They gained elevation as they went away to the northeast and changed more to a whitish color. By 11:20 p.m. the lights were too hard to follow. Mr. Francombe telephoned a friend at Westerway, 18kms nor- theast of Maydena. She confirmed when the Centre contacted her, that she had been told to look out for the lights sometime before ll:30p.m. , On going out the witness located the two lights in the northwest over Mt. Field East (127mts). They looked like two yellow lights, one higher and closer, the second lower and further away. The closer light passed through or behind the clouds whilst the second light was always in view. They continued on a steady flight northwards until after 5 minutes or more they were too hard to discern. Ellendale Also That same night Mr. and Mrs. G.jG. Triffit were driving home from Westerway to Ellendale at 12:45 a.m. (March 11). Mr. Triffitt says they saw to the west in a den- sly timbered gully on Mr. Field East a round bright orange and red light. It was maybe 3 miles away. The light was going from orange to red all the time and was well below the skyline. YOUR ARTICLES, NEWSCLIPPINGS, AND SUGGESTIONS ARE GREATLY APPRECIATED. SEND MATER IALTO: t D.

Originally the light was . matched sized but with its ' movement it grew to Ic sized as if coming towards them. It was still below the horizon. Marc Akinson (12) and a friend were first to see the lights appear a few minutes apart from over the eastern hills at 9:50 p.m. They ran to call out other residents then the church bell was rung so that numerous other witnesses gathered outside. Geoff Marshall said the lights kept on a steady course towards the west until they eventually faded out of sight in the south west at 10 p.m. The lights were very bright starlike in appearance. Const. LoWery said the lights were travelling quite slowly beneath the overcast sky. Judging by light aircraft that pass over the town he felt the lights were con- siderable smaller than a plane. Sightings Enid? The last two reports from the town have been from isolated wit- nesses who have seen the lights or light going away to the north east. On March 30th after 10 p.m. three witnesses saw a light crossing south east behind 'Ab- botts LO., it then reappeared moving back to the NW before halting briefly! Then the light moved away to the north east becoming smaller and smaller un- til it was too hard to pick up. It had been in view for 10 minutes. The larger than Venus sized light was orange on top and yellow .below but the colors kept changing as if the light was rolling. The last sighting was on April 14th at 9 p.m. This time a lone wit- ness saw the two orange red lights for four minutes through broken cloud. They were travelling from SW to NE and looked starlike. They were finally lost above the clouds.   n"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Denmark E-M case investigated (from SUFOl Newsletter, August 1975) The observation of police officer Evald Hansen Ma amp has been gradually known by most people through the reports in the newspapers. Still we give a detailed report, as the accounts in the papers in several cases have been inaccurate. The same thing has to be said about the TV-news' treatment of the case. The observation occurred on August 13 at 10:50 p.m. At the time Maarup was travelling in a police car at his way home to his house at Knud. The event oc- curred while he was driving bet- ween Kabdrup and Fjelstrup, and was on his way downhill to a small hollow a few hundred metres from a T-junction, where the Hader- slev-Fjelstrup road is crossing the road to Kapdrup. The site of the observation is 8-10 km to the Nor- th of Haderslev. Maarup says: \"I was driving alone in my patrol car on Thur- sday at approximately 10:50 p.m. Suddenly the car was surrounded by a bright bluish-white light, and at the same time the car engine stopped. The lights of the car also disappeared, even the light of the ignition. I drove aside the road and stopped. The bright nepnlike light outside was so dazzling, that I could see nothing. With my arm hiding my eyes - to protect them against the light -1 succeeded in groping my way to the radio. When I got the microphone and tried to call the station, it ap- peared, that the radio was just as \"dead\" as any of the electric in- stallations in the car.\" The observer continues: \"The temperature inside the car was in- creasing and it became pleasently hot. How hot I cannot tell, but it could be compared to the heat you 10 Second phase. feel, when you drive against the sun on a summer day\", Maarup tells.  ' \"After a while the light was rising. It was a conical light with a diameter in the bottom of 4-5 metres. When I was bending for- wards and looking up, I could see that the light cone ended at the bottom of a big grey thing. Not a sound was heard from the thing.\" (See sketches). \"After a few seconds the light was drawn\" into the thing. It is difficult to explain how; the light was not extinguished, but the bot- tom of the light was rising, so that it became dark under the cone. (See sketch). It took about 5 minutes for the light to be drawn up. I stepped out of the car and saw, how the last remnant of the light cone disappeared into the bottom of the thing in a hole with a diameter of quite a metre.\" When the light had disappeared into the thing, this started moving. In a few seconds it vanished vertically in the air. It accellerated strongly - still without a sound. When the object moved away, all lights in the elec- tric system of the car return ed. I Third phase. tried to start and it started quite normally, just as I again was able to get in touch with the station. I reported to the station, what I had experienced.\" The police officer goes on with his report: \"Before I stepped out of the car, I had taken three pic- tures with the fastened camera of the patrol car. Now I took three more photographs of the highway, which was lit-up by my headlights. Honestly speaking, I have no idea at what time of the observation I took the first three ., photographs,\" Maarup says, \"but instinctively .1 must have pulled ^ the release of the camera, - '- presumably during the last part of the observation.\" The camera is a Japanese product, FUJAXA. It is capable of taking about one picture per second and has automatic delivery of the film, so that the film is moving one picture ahead, as soon as the photo has been taken. Also it has automatic diaphragm. The pictures was taken with a Neopan SS film. \"Having talked to the station I once more stepped out of the car to see, if there were residues or"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"trails of thing in the area around the car, but I found nothing; While I was collecting myself a little, I laid my hand on the front mudguard and could feel, that it was still hot. Besides I will note, that the car is an almost brand- new Ford Zodiac 6-cylinder engine) and that it is in good technical shape. It has had no technical problems either before or after the observation.'' \"After a while an oncoming car > passed, but I had no intention of stopping it, because there was no , more to be seen.\" \"If I should describe the thing\", Maarup says, \"I can only say, that it was circular and about 10 metres in diameter seen from my position obliquely from below. It had a luminious hole in the bottom, from where the cone of light came out. This hole was quite one metre in diameter, con-' sequently about 1^0 of the total diameter of the thing. The object had two extensions or domes at the underside. These were about \\- l k metres in diameter. When I saw the thing through the win- dscreen, I will estimate it was so near as 20 metres away from me.\" When Maarup came home, his wife thought he looked pale, and he told her about the event. The observer had no intention of publishing the report. The next day, when he had the film developed ° and saw, that something appeared on it, he delivered the film to the Air Force at the air base at Skrydstrup. From here the report leaked out to the press. SUFOI has up til now received seven other reports from the same night, but we have not suc- ceeded in getting out witnesses, who are able directly to confirm the statement of the policeman. The observation occurred 400 meters from the nearest house, which is a rest home. Nobody has apparently seen anything from here. Policeofficer Evald Hansen Maarup. Evald 'Hansen Maarup has made an extremely reliable im- pression on everybody, with whom he has got in touch. I myself have several times spoken to him, and I have got the im- pression, that he is a calm and well-balanced person. As to the observed, it will be noted, that the whole incident in- clusive the effects, is correspon- ding to other observations from at home and abroad. As there were no witnesses, the statement of the policeman on the whole is the only thing, on which the report can be based, because the photographed spot of light cannot be explained. It does not agree in detail with the report of the observer, - but it is still there, so what has been photographed, is impossible to say. On the other hand we can establish, that no other thing in the area of the observation should be able to make a light similar to the photographed light. The observation of police officer Evald Hansen Maarup was in several ways remarkable. Firstly because it was treated by the press - and as front-page news at that. Both the observation and'the comments; on it were fairly treated, with a single exeption to the rule, namely the TV-news. At least they could have turned the photos the right way up. - Only one thing is missing from the quarter of the press, namely .following up the case! The in- terest of the press in a given case has a very fast half-life period, and the same thing happenedhere as abroad: The authorities pigeonholed the case so long, that the interest of the press had gone a long time ago, when the pictures at last were returned to Maarup. The observation • ••;was remarkable also because the authorities, in this case the RDAF, were involved. The reac- tion of the AirForce followed a hypothetical book of instructions for USAF, using exactly the same pattern: a)The Air Froce states: it was a question of 6 T-33 jet airplanes. c) The Air Force states: that it is not at present possible to tell, what it was, but assures, that previous examinations of similar phenomena have proved, that most cases have a quite natural cause; such as lights on airplanes, meteors, weather balloons, or the plant of Venus! d) Silence. Silence for a long time. Silence for so long a time, that the interest of the presse is quietly fading a way. e) The Air Force quietly retur- nes the film to Maarup - without any sort of comments. Not even a kindly - thank you! f) The curtain falls. End of the performance. In the hope of being able to throw light on, what the Air Force did with the film and get the con-, elusion, that Maarup did not get, I spoke to major Brons Hansen, the press officer of the Air Force. He informed, that no closer analysis of the photos, compared with the report of the observer, had been made. It was only examined to establish, if it could have been air- craft. If this was not the case, the subject was of- no interest to the Air Force! At inquiry Brons Han- sen informed, that UFOs as such was not within the competence of the Air Force, but of the Research Council of ,the Defence. However they had not seen the film, - and they had not asked for it either."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The strange spot of light, which Maarup photographed.

If the Research Council of the Defence shall have hopes of get- ting reports of UFOs from non- military people, they at least have to provide for a better internal communication, as the swit- chboard only after long and hard investigations found a major, who knew a little about the subject. The major only knew the Maarup case from the newspapers and besides he thought, that there were no more UFO investigations going on,- because it had ap- peared, they had a natural ex- planation! The conclusion must be, that the UFO investigation og the Danish authorities on the whole is corresponding to the task being done in the same area in most other countries. The result is that the private UFO investigation must go on collecting, preparing, and sending out UFO information, hoping, that science and authorities some day will take up the problem for an ac- tual serious investigation.

Translated by Jacques Deschenes, Hull, Quebec, Canada). M. Severin, a 21 year old commerce clerk, was walking home on a narrow road in Petite- He (Reunion), France, February 14, 1974 about 1:30 p.m. The road adjoined a corn field in an empty, uninhabited area. Suddenly, he felt a strange force pulling him from the back, as if pulled by a giant magnet, and felt a tingling in his head. Then he saw an object the size of a car, very white, with a form like \"two half-eggs on a plate.\" The UFO was hovering 50 cm from the ground, and a luminous ray was being directed unto Mr. Severin from it. Through an opening in the object he could see stairs with three steps which touched the ground. In that opening was a strange small being which moved down the stairs and joined another being that appeared to be scraping on the ground. Then a third being appeared with a \"bag\" in his hand and began to move around the one scraping the ground as if trying to help him: The beings were estimated to be 1 or 1.2 meters tall, dressed in bright white, apparently metallic suits, and had antennas on each side- of their heads. After a few moments a fourth being started down the stairs, saw the witness, one of the antennas began to oscillate, and all entered the UFO. The opening closed and the object disappeared in the sky. The witness was badly frightened, lost his voice, suffered from headaches, and had impaired vision for two days. The UFO was described as white and disc-shaped with transparent dome.

Dr. David R. Saunders began building UFOCAT in 1967, and donated it to the Center for UFO Studies in 1975. UFOCAT is being used to make statistical studies of UFO reports, such as David Saunders' \"Ex- trinsic Factors in UFO - Repor- ting\" (American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Paper 75-43) and \"A Spatiotem- poral Invariant for Major UFO Waves\" (Proceedings of the Cen- ter for UFO Studies Conference 1976, in publication). UFOCAT is also being used to provide catalogs of reports of particular interest to specialists at nominal cost. Such catalogs selectively list reports by such factors as geographical location (eg. state of Wisconsin or Pacific Ocean), typs of report (eg. occupants or ab- ductions), date of report(eg. year 1973 or Oct. 1954 in France), special report feature (eg. im- prints or electromagnetic effects) and even such factors as sightings from airplanes or reports from military personel. The possible combinations are as broad as the user's request and the extent to which each factor is coded in the file. A print out of a major section of UFOCAT has been in use at the Center for some time. Each entry in UFOCAT is a record of the salient features of a report of an individual UFO event, citing the source. Multiple reports of a single event are blocked together, headed by the primary entry, generally the earliest chronological report. Sub- sequent investigations or witness statements are flagged.

Todd Zechel (Director Wisconsin Division, GSW) Editor's Note: W. Todd Zechel is a former employee of the National Security Agency (NSA), in an overt role, and he was also employed by another agency in a covert role. About a year ago, he began writing to GSW, and was admitted as a member, Since joining GSW, he has specialized in researching CIA and Air Force activities regarding UFOs. He has also created a Wisconsin division of GSW, in order to solicit more funds for GSW research operations, and to get more people involved with supporting GSW programs. Probably the most important document that GSW has obtained thus far, is the letter received from the CIA dated march 26, 1976. In thi s letter, Mr. Gene F. Wilson, the CIA's Freedom and Privacy Coordinator, states: \"At ho time prior to the formation of the Robertson Panel and sub- sequent to the issuance of the panel's report, has the CIA engaged in the study of the UFO phenomena. The Robertson Panel Report is summation of the Agen- cy's interest and involvement in this matter.\" These statements by the CIA are total fabrications—as are the documents pertaining to Ralph Mayher which they enclosed with the March 26 letter. Example: A document dated December 20, 1957, purported to be a memo from the Chief of the Contact Division to the Chief of the Detroit office. The document contains three (3) numbered paragraphs, only one of which was not deleted in accordance with exemptions (1) and (3) of the Freedom of In- 16 formation Act. Paragraph (2) of the document is as follows: \"The subject of UFO was under the preview of CIA for a limited time only. This was caused by a request from 'the hill' which steamed from all the publicity given to recent UFO sightings. We assume that the request has been satisfie because the case has been closed and the subject dropped by CIA. Any letter which source (Editor's note: 'source' ap- parently refers to Ralph Mayher, which will be dealt with in further detail now writes to the DCI would probably be forwarded to the Air Force for their information. We would suggest to source that any correspondence be directed to the Air Force.\" How ironic it is that the only thing in a classified memo which is releasable is a self-serving propaganda statement. Ac- cording the laws of Congress, and the Freedom of Information Act, itself, a government agency must not disclose confidential sources of information. Therefore, by releasing these documents, and identifying Ralph Mayher as a \"source,\" the CIA not only violated the law, but they violated their own rules and regulations. Why then did the CIA release documents, and thereby com- promise a source—Ralph Mayher? The answer to that question is the tip-off what's really been going on, and the key to finding the truth about UFOs: In analyzing the December 20, 1957, memo, please notice that there is a statement which reads: \"This was caused by a request from 'the hill' which steamed from all the pubicity given recent UFO sightings.\" (Emphasis ad- ded.) Now, this document was purportedly created in 1957; yet, the Robertson Panel met in 1953. Therefore, the word \"recent\" is incongruous with the idea that this document fabricated the Mayher documents made a serious error. It's obvious the document fabricator got a little confused—which is to be expected when someone is creatin deliberate falsehoods, without being totally familiar with the history of the subject. Thus, besides the fact that we know the CIA's involvement in UFO resear- ch has been much greater than just the Robertson Panel, it's ap- parent that these documents were fabricated solely to try to con- vince the readers that the CIA thinks there is nothing to UFOs whatsoever. Another phony aspect of the December 20, 1957 memo, is that it purports to be from the \"Chief, Contact Division.\" There is no such thing as the \"Contact Division\" within the CIA. There is a Domestic Operations division, which is a division of the Direc- torate of Operations (Clandestine Services). This is one of the most secretive of all CIA operations—since the very idea of domestic .operation is a flagrant violation of the CIA's charter. Ob- viously, the name \"Contact Division\" was fabricated solely for the purposes of misleading and misinforming recipients of these documents. Since July 19, 1976, GSW- Wisconsin has sent the CIA four separate FCIA requests. The first two requests were answered with"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"the typical CIA delaying tactics: After about month, we get a repl which states that \"the requester is required to furnish a reasonable description of the documents sought, and not just a series of questions.\" The CIA thereby avoids answering our question—which dealt with various CIA Involvements with UFO incidents, and an attempt to get them to clarify their statement in which they purport that the Robertson Panel was the summation of their interest in UFOs. They would not answer the question of whether it was only a matter of semantics. In fact, the CIA will answer no questions, whatsoever. Therefore, in the last two (2) requests, we have concentrated on requesting specif documents. The following are excerpts from our two most recent FOIA requests: August 17: (1) All documents in the National Photographic In- terpretation Center pertaining to UFOs and the analysis thereof. (2) All documents and pictorial data in any CIA archives per- tainin to UFOs—particularly, the Ralph Mayher film. (3) Documen- ts pertaining to a briefing session held at CIA Headquarters, 5th, \"K\" Sts.NW, Washington, DC. This briefing involved Major Robert J. Friend of ATIC's Aerial Phenomena Division and CIA Personnel. The briefing occurred July 9, 1959. (4) Documents per- taining to a breifing session held at CIA Headquarters, Washington, DC, on July 6, 1959, in which two (2) ONI officers reported to three (3) CIA agents the results of their investigation of a woman reported to have made psychic contact with UFOs (aliens). If need be, GSW will sup- ply the names of all personnel in- volved in this briefing, and if CIA denies this specific request, we are prepared to subpoena all par- ties to court and have them testify as to their role in this affair. (5) All documents in the records or archives of the Office of Scientific Intelligence pertaining to UFOs and the analysis thereof.

Assistant Secretary Gen. Kingsley and Col. James McKee, SAFLL; Lt. Col. Sullivan, AF- CIM-Pla; Lt. Col. Tacker, SAFOI- 3rd; Maj. Robert Friend, ATIC- Aerial Phenomena Div.; Maj. J. Boland, SAFLL; and Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Scientific Consultant to Project Blue Book. The documen- ts in question are Mr. Warner's report to the Director pertaining to ATIC's Investigation Capability, and general progress of CIA's \"interest\" in the Air For- ce UFO intelligence collection and analysis program. (2) Memos generated on or about July 15, 1960, by Mr. Richard Payne, Technical Advisor to ATIC, in which Mr. Payne reports to the Office of Scientific Intelligence on AFCIN-4E2x, the paper submitted by Dr. Hynek entitled \"ATIC UFO Investigation Capability.\" Also, additional memos outlining CIA \"interests\" in ATIC's progress and capabilities. On August 26,1976, the CIA sent the following reply to our August 17 request: \"This acknowledges receipt of your letter of August 17, 1976 requesting, under provisions of the FOIA, access to certain CIA records dealing with UFOs. I shall arrange for a search of CIA files and shall be in further communication with you once the search has been completed and any records found reviewed for releasability under the Act.\" What this means is that the CIA has accepted our request as a reasonable description of the documents sought. However, this does not mean that we will obtain any significant information. On the contrary, I believe that the CIA was stalling for time, all along, and is now is the process of fabricating more documents which will again try to convince us that they have no information of any value pertainin to UFO phenomena—which is a blatant lie. However, by having them deny that any UFO documents exist, we will have a case to present to the courts, the media, and to Congress—because we can prove that they had access to UFO films and photographs; W3 can prove that all the incidents outlined to our FOIA requests ac- tually occurred; and we can prove they did in fact try to silence Ralph Mayher, and other UFO photographers and witnesses. What is certain in all of this is that GSW-Wisconsin will get stuck with a tremendous bill. The CIA's charges for s searching for all of these documents will most likely amount to hundreds of dollars. At the present time, GSW-Wisconsin is unable to fund these expenses. The Wisconsin organization is just getting started, and has yet to at- tract any significant contribution Therfore, GSW needs con- tributions specifically for these programs; and needs them urgen- tly, as soon as possible. One of the most important aspects of my research has been the attempt to locate Ralph Mayher. This is necessary because we need the complete details of Mayher's interaction with the CIA. We may also need his testimony should we have to go to court and/or Congress. The 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"efforts to track down Mayher have been fruitless, until recently. A couple of weeks ago, a GSW member on the East Coast took time off of work to travel to New York and inquire at Westinghouse Broadcasting Corp. of any data they had on Ralph Mayher in their personnel files (Mayher worked for a Westinghouse radio station, KYW). However, the in- formation he obtained was not sufficient with which to locate Mayher. But, armed with Mayher's Social Security number, I made numerous long-distance phone calls to Washington, DC, in order to contact the Marine locator service which might have information on Mayher's where whereabouts. Finally, I was able to contact the office which han- dled the letter \"M,\" and under the ruse that I wanted to invite Mayher to a Marine reunion, I was able to obtain his serial nr, full name, and most importantly, his date of birth. With this info, a friend of Bill Spaulding's, who has \"connections,\" is currently locating Mayher for us. The point is: I've already spent a great deal of my own money just attempting to locate Mayher. The next step will be to contact him in person, and for me to convince Mayher t that he should cooperate with us. Yet, where will the funds for this research come from? Unless GSW's membership has a sudden seizure of generosity, there's likely to be a lot of work unfinished; breakthroughs which are just around the corner will be delayed or even never ac- complished. Frankly, the well is dry; and unless we get some significant contributions, most of this research will go unfinished. The facts are that we are in the process of proving that the CIA has been collecting and analyzing UFO intelligence data for many years. Contrary to what the CIA would have us believe, UFOs have an intelligence value of the 18 highest order. The irony is that in order to conceal this data from the Russians, and convince them that UFOs have no intelligence value, and thereby gain the upper hand in developing UFO propulsion systems, it is also necessary to conceal this from the American public—and even the Air Force. This is tragic; but it is also typical of most the in- telligenceefforts I have been privy to. Unfortunately, very of- ten the Russians know more about our operations than the American people. We know, for example, that the CIA UFO program was in- stituted by Maj. Gen. Charles Cabell, who after founding Project Blue Book and installing Capt. Ruppelt as CO, moved over to the CIA and became Asst. Director.Cabell was formerly the head of Air Force Intelligence. It was Ca bell's influence that per- suaded the CIA to take UFOs seriously; and he also established the duality in which Blue Book seemed to be the only government agency investigating UFOs. BLue Book, in fact, was mostly a PR ef- fort used to convince peop that UFOs had no intelligence value. Of course, BLue Rock officers had no idea that they were being used in this manner. Which is also typical of CIA/military relation- ships. In April, 1976,1 sent some of the CIA/Mayher info to Rep. Robert Kastenmeior (D-Wis) for his review. Kastenmeier is a member of the House Judiciary Committee and he's also Chairman, Sub- committee on Courts, Civil Liber- ties and the Administration of Justice. Kastenmeier replied as follows: \"....Because I share your concern with the government's tendenc to over-classify documen- ts, I asked councel to my Judiciary subcommittee to per- sonally review your letter. He in- forms me that it is not unusual for the CIA and other agencies to take an inordinately long time to reply to FOIA requests. In fact, a num- ber of constituents have ex- perienced similar problems in dealing with the FBI and CIA. It is difficult to assess the validity of the exemptions claimed by the agency in denying the requested material because we have no way of knowing the nature of the exempted material. The agency is as unresponsive in dealing with Congressional requests for information as it is with private requests. The only way.of testing their response is to appeal the agency's decision to federal courts.\" This has to be the next step in our program to get at the truth. We must follow through on these requests. We must go to court whenever necessary. We've come too far to let the CIA off the hook, now. Our resolve must not weaken; GSW's membership—if they sincerely want to find the tru- th— must give these research programs their full support. Much of my research has dealt with investigating the Air Force UFO C&A program. Project Blue Book. I've interviewed a number of Air Force radar operators and interceptor pilots in connection with their experiences with UFO R/V incidents. What is readily ap- parent from these interviews, is that there were much higher rates of R/V incidents than we have been led to believe. And since most of these sightings were associated with SAGE radar systems—which computer sort the targets—it's hard to believe that these men were chasing natural phenomena. I've also conducted four lengthy interviews, via long-distance, with Lt. Col. (ret.) Robert J. Friend. In talking with Friend, and after gaining his confidence, I related the detailsof my previous interviews with other Air Force personnel. Friend said he had no reason to doubt that the men were"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"telling the truth. He was aware of the great number of R/V in- cidents; and he was also aware that ATIC's Radar Analysis sec- tion was explaining away these sightings—in the typical Blue Book manner. I was able to obtain some very important and startling in- formation from Col. Freind. However, because of the nature of our relationship, and the fact that we are in the process of at- tempting to locate the data he described to me, at this time I am unable to give you any further description of the info. Suffice it to say that Friend has provided us with some info that will ultimately prove the Air Force has good reason to pursue the investigation of UFO phenomena; that contrary to their current PR statements, the Air Force did encounter evidence which indicated ex- traterrestrail origin (UFO residuum material) and they did have photographic evidence in- dicating technology beyond our present knowledge and com- prehension. All data will be released to GSW's membership as soon as we locate it and/or obtain it.

MUFON International Coordinator MUFON 103 OLDTOWNE RD. SEGUIN, TX 78155 Phones: 512-379-9216 (MUFON headquarters and Walt Andrus' home) 512-379-8850 (Director Walt Andrus' place of employment) On December 8, 1975, the same day that an unexplained crater- like depression was found in a wheat and barley field near Murray Bridge, South Australia, another case involving physical traces (but no visible UFO) oc- curred at Tranmere, S. Australia. The witness, a 22-year-old girl, woke at 2:50 AM to the sound of an eerie noise as if \"coming from a strange animal.\" After about 5 minutes she awoke her mother who also heard the noise. The mother described it as sounding \"like compressed air escaping through a valve.\" After about 10 or 12 minutes the noise stopped and the sound of something banging against the roof was heard, then silence. The next morning, at the suggestion of police, the women called the UFO Research organization. They had found two circular areas in a strawberry patch in their back yard, about one meter across and a like distance apart, close to a fence. Within the circles the plan- ts had been bent over and swirled counter-clockwise. The soil was not affected and no deposits of any kinds were visible. (UFO Research Newsletter, No. 17,Jan-Febl976) Near Graye-et-Charnay, Fran- ce, in May 1974, Mr. Roger Marechal was awakened by a bright light about 2 AM. He saw a glowing object about 300 meters from the house and tried to awaken his parents, but when he returned to the window the object was gone. Next morning he and his father discovered 14 markings, about 50 cm apart, in- dented in the ground to depths of 2.5-3.5. Police of Saint-Amour estimated that an oval object about 2.8 m in diameter had caused the markings. Markings as if made by a tripod landing gear were also seen. Photographs were taken and sent to a laboratory in Paris. (Tribune de Geneve, May 28, 1974, translated by Jacques Deschenes). At the end of June 1974, inhabitants of Ellemes, France, were awakened by a bright glow and strange noise. They repor- tedly saw a luminous orange cylinder on a house-top. Alter a few minutes the phenomenon disappeared. Next day the owner of the house discovered that an area of his roof had be melted; his car battery and others in the area were dead. Some zinc samples were sent to .a laboratory for analysis. (Le Provencal, July 12, 1974, translated by Jacques Deschenes). A witnessed UFO landing with resulting physical traces oc- curred December 31, 1973 at Pont- a-Vendin, France, Driving to Lens at 7 AM, Mr. Jean Liefooghe sud- denly saw two luminous spheres flash across the road ahead of him. The road was straight and visibility good. Off to his left he then saw a bright glow and sto- pped the car to observe. Landed vertically in the field, about 300 meters from the road, there was an enormous cylinder, apparently 30 m tall and 5 m in diameter. The cigar-shaped UFO then rose at great speed and disappeared. On his return trip from Lens, Liefooghe investigated the lan- ding spot and found footprints like those of a 10-year-old boy. Also, there were three holes 10 cm in diameter arranged in the form of a triangle 4.7 m on two sides and 8.8 meters on the largest side. The site was investigated by the police of Pont-a-Vendin.
