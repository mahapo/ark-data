FROM THE EDITOR This issue is dedicated to Isabel Davis, a veteran UFO researcher and writer who died in June. Isabel was one of the founding members of Civilian Saucer Intelligence in New York in 1954, and in the 1970s, she played an active role in NICAP in Washington, D.C. She was noted for her writings on contactees, extraterrestrial visitations and other subjects. She personally investigated the Kelly, Kentucky, humanoid case and, with Ted Bloecher, was author of Close Encounters at Kelly and Others of 1955. A more complete report on Isabel will be published in the September issue. In this issue UFO WATERS STILL RUN DEEP: A report on the 1984 MUFON Symposium     3 Story and Photos by Dennis W.

The event was generally well-reported upon by the local print and electronic media. As expressed by Chairman Tom Deuley, the format was chosen because one of the main problems confronting contemporary ufology \"is associated with how the public perceives the UFO and the people that study the UFO phenomenon. Although the majority of the public believes there is some basis in 'reality for the UFO, they are still reluctant to discuss the matter openly for fear of ridicule. \"They also tend to believe that the people who study UFOs are unbalanced in one way or another. Thirdly, most of the people in the public realm who do believe in the reality of the UFO have accepted the idea that it is somehow associated with extraterres- trial intelligence.\" Thus, the Symposium was designed to educate the public at large that the phenomenon is worthy of serious scientific consideration and subject to complex interpretation. In other words, while \"ET\" has become a popular catch-all phrase, UFO waters run deeper still. PUBLIC EDUCATION Appropriately enough, then, Saturday morning's first speech was delivered by a public educator, Marge By DENNIS W. STACY Assistant Editor BUOD HOPKINS TOM DEULEY Christensen, of Massachusetts, who teaches high school English and is the Chairperson of MUFON's National Committee on Public Information and Public Education. \"The UFO phenomenon is a vital and fascinating subject, which will someday undoubtedly impact life on this planet in ways we can now only dimly perceive,\" Marge said. \"It is ironic that the average American is almost totally unfamiliar with the subject and the base amount of data and documentation which exist on the topic. \"Unfortunately, this situation lends itself conveniently to a policy of government coverup of the subject, as well as to the apparent policy of our national media of treating the UFO subject either as taboo and untouchable, or as sensational and in the realm of fantasy or the occult. Until this situation is reversed, our task as UFO researchers will be extremely difficult and sometimes nearly impossible. \"It is therefore imperative that public information and public education of the UFO subject become a top priority of euery serious ufologist immediately. A massive, nationwide effort in this area is urgently needed.\" Marge suggested several ways in which this might be done and local MUFON chapters upgraded in the process. More qualified and trained investigators are needed, along with funds, a pool of credible speakers and individual local UFO hotlines employing an economical telephone answering machine. Among the other approaches Marge mentioned were the creation of a portable display, guest lectures, close contact with local law enforcement officers, and the teaching of UFO courses to gifted students and adult community colleges. By way of a national effort, Marge said that plans for a UFO Information Week will be announced at the 1985 Symposium. \"Let's resolve now to work together,\" she said. \"Together we can and must open the door to an informed public, and to a solution to this vital enigma.\" UFO SAGA New York author/artist Budd Hopkins said the title of his paper, \"The Haunting of Kitley Woods • An Ongoing UFO Saga,\" was not lightly chosen. \"My dictionary defines a saga as an account 'in which the members of a family or generations of a family or social group are chronicled in a long and leisurely narrative.' To haunt is 'to visit habitually or appear to frequent as a spirit...to recur persistently in the consciousness.' \" Hopkins said that he was not sure (continued on nexf page) MARGE CHRISTENSEN"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Symposium, Continued we were dealing with \"spirits,\" and that his narrative would be neither long nor leisurely, but 'otherwise the definitions seem to fit the Kitley Woods case precisely. Budd was first introduced to the family involved in September 1983, when he received a letter from a reader of his book, MISSING TIME. The writer was a 24-year old divorced mother of two, Debbie, who lives with her parents in a rural area outside Indianapolis. In July 1983, both Debbie and her mother had seen a small glowing light near the family's pool house. Mother and daughter investigated, Debbie armed with her father's .22 rifle,. but nothing was to be found. Later,, however, it was noticed that the • backyard was \"burned,\" that nothing would grow where it had beforehand that it was now strangely avoided by animals, particularly the cardinals who had once flocked there. But the vanishing pool light was only the tip of the proverbial iceberg. It turned put that Kathy, Debbie's 35-year old sister, had encountered a silver UFO with colored lights in the summer of 1965. She turned down, the radio to see if the UFO was making any noise, but when she looked up it was already gone. Teh years later,.Kathy attended a hypnosis session designed to help one lose weight. What followed was more like a nightmare. Shortly after going to sleep, she woke up and could niether talk nor hear. She was taken to the emergency room and given tranquilizers. Over the next few days she found herself doing the opposite of what the hypnotist had suggested. She. called him to ask what was wrong, but immediately upon hearing his voice she had a violent desire to kill him. Space does not permit a complete coverage of all of the Kitley Woods saga (the details can be found in the annual Symposium Proceedings along with all of the other papers). Suffice it to say here that three generations of a family were involved in an incredible series of events still under investigation. These include physical scars with supposedly no known origin, a 4 nocturnal appearance of two entities at the foot of Debbie's bed, at which time she was handed a small black box, a possible abduction by UFO and so on. The study of the case has involved psychological profiles, regressive hypnosis, arid the analysis of physical landing traces. TOM ADAMS MUTE EVIDENCE Although reports of animal mutilations involving mysterious circ.umstances have declined drastically since the peak year of 1975, the phenomenon continues on an abated basis, said Tom Adams of Project Stigma (See Chapter Seven of Greenwood and Fawcett's just- published Clear Intent, for example). Adams is also editor/publisher of the Project's journal, \"Stigmata.\" Despite claims of a new mass- market paperback that animal mutilations could be laid at the feet of so-called satanic cults and what might be described as media hysteria, there is a core of reports, many involving unmarked helicopters, that beg \"conventional\" explanation, said Adams. Among other anomalies, these include incidents in which cuts were reportedly made by a pinking shearlike device, i.e., leaving serrated edges, and a unique instance annalyzed by a Colorado researcher in which the \"cut\" was found to have been made between cells! Adams quoted science teacher lona Hoeppner as follows: \"I did careful microscopic exams on the tissue cut from the belly. It was not a cut, not a laser burn. No cell was destroyed. It (the incision) was separated bertueen cells, cell for cell. No cell was disrupted in the mutilators' cut. There is nothing that I know of that could do such a thing.\" ; Adams also cited several cases in which UFOs seemed to be involved. In one, in April of 1980, a central Texas farmer was walking his pasture in search of a cow about to give birth. He came across instead two non-human creatures carrying a calf between them. Each had hold of one of its limbs. They were described as about four feet tall and of a light or yellow-green color. The farmer fled. Two days later he returned to the site to find the carcass of a calf, only the head, feet and hide of which remained, , the animal seeming to have been skinned with its^ hide pulled up over its head arid turned inside out. No specific UFO connection was postulated by the farmer, however, who was extremely reluctant to discuss the incident. South.of Houston, in 1973, a Mrs. Judith Doraty and her daughter were reportedly v abducted aboard a UFO (the information was recovered under hypnosis). Mrs. Doraty also said she saw a calf taken aboard, levitated by a light beam, that was subsequently mutilated. Other mutilation reports have involved apparent indentations in the ground and the presence of quiet running, unmarked helicopters. In Colorado, in September of 1980, one ; witness reported seeing a \"helicopter\" which then turned into a silver, ball- shaped object somewhat smaller than the original \"craft.\" If reports of animal mutilations dry up altogether, said Adams, we will have to ask ourselves two questions. \"What has become of the predators detractors said were responsible for the 'real' mutilations? And, more chillingly, what are the mutilators themselves up to now?\" ENTITY ENIGMA As noted by Hilary Evans of London, the subcategory of UFO reports involving sightings of humanoids, or near-human entities, is puzzling in more ways than one. Are such cases objective events, subjective projections of the subconsciousness, or (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"HILARY EVANS Symposium, Continued even a blend of the two? \"Whichever,\" said Hilary, \"meeting an alien entity seems to be a lonely experience. Rarely, very rarely, is it shared, and even in such cases there is usually one dominant percipient, the other being passive or even dormant. Mostly this is something that happens to people alone at home, or working alone, or driving alone late at night.\" In many cases, the experience also seems to share the characteristics of other paranormal events such as ghostly apparitions, bedroom visitors, human doubles, or doppelgangers, and even the appearance of both demonic and angelic \"spirits\". Hilary cited the case of 17-year old Glenda Smith, coming home alone from work late one night, who discovered she was being followed by a UFO. The silent object was floating rooftop-high and was about the size and shape of a jumbo jet, although clearly wingless. A short while later her sister also saw a UFO. The followup investigation revealed that Glenda had been visited in her bedroom some five years earlier by what she called a spacewoman. The entity re-appeared on several occasions, sometimes in dreams, sometimes only as a felt presence. In general she seemed to be concerned about Glenda's welfare while being neither overtly malevolent nor benevolent. In another instance, a young German girl was climbing alone in the Bavarian Alps when she lost her way while in a particularly precarious position (a year later another climber fell to her death in the same spot). She wrote Hilary that \"all of a sudden I noticed a sort of big ball of light, and this condensed to the shape of a tall, rather Chinese-looking gentleman...it all seemed then quite natural to me. The gentleman bowed, spoke a few words, led me to a small path to the tourists' way, and disappeared as a ball of light.\" Obviously, such experiences raise as many questions as they purport to answer. Is Glenda's \"spacewoman\" actually an extraterrestrial entity or something more akin to what might be called a \"Guardian Angel,\" and that in turn only another name for a subconscious projection, a clever way one area of the brain has evolved for communicating information to another? In this scenario, Glenda casts her subconscious knowledge in a culturally contemporary form, i.e., as a spacewoman, rather than as, say, a saint or visiting angel as was done in the past. While many of the issues are still in limbo, said Hilary, \"One thing is already clear. Whatever or whoever is responsible whether these experiences originate with the Cosmic Brothers, or with God, or with Satan, or with beings from some undiscovered plane of existence, or with some unplumbed aspect of our own human natures, the contact experience is of the greatest possible importance for our knowledge both of ourselves and of the universe we inhabit.\" BIG BROTHER AND UFOS One of the more anticipated speakers on Saturday was Barry Greenwood, co-author with Larry Fawcett of CLEAR INTENT, a survey of government documents dealing with UFOs released under the Freedom of Information Act. A hundred copies of BARRY GREENWOOD the $17.95 hardback were on hand and were virtually sold out during the course of the Symposium, Barry being kind enough to autograph copies. By now, Barry's main contention is probably widely known: \"The government continues to investigate UFOs long after official investigations allegedly ceased in 1969, and it continues to pursue a policy of censorship and secrecy surrounding UFOs due to the fact that it perceives UFOs as a national security problem.\" Barry then went on to cite several cases in which UFOs apparently breached military security and were reported by various base personnel. Probably, the most significant of these incidents occurred in December 1980 at Bentwaters Royal Air Force Base, England, in Rendlesham Forest. According to an eyewitness account, military personnel were called up to surround at 50-foot diameter, aspirin-shaped object which was hovering about a foot off the ground. Inside the transparent object, a bright, pulsating mist could be seen. This object was soon joined by a smaller red light that came to rest about 20 feet overhead. It hovered for a minute, then exploded in red particles. Both light and object disappeared. In the latter's place could now be seen a domed disc, bright white in color and with an intricately detailed surface. There were some other peculiarities as well. Shadows cast on the ship's hull behaved strangely and the witness, a security policeman, saw entities standing beside the craft which huddled together when a loud noise came from the field. At this point the witness' memory fades and he wakes up in his bunk at 4 AM, fully clothed and muddy up to his knees. The case made national headlines in England when a document, signed by the American base commander, Lt. Colonel Charles I. Halt, and attesting to the UFO sighting, was made public. Halt was subsequently reprimanded by his superiors. According to Barry, the document \"provided some of the strongest evidence of UFO reality in existence.\" The complete text can be found in the Symposium Proceedings (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Symposium, Continued as well at Barry and Larry's CLEAR INTENT, along with other official (and intriguing) communiques. \"In conclusion,\" said Barry, \"I can say quite confidently that UFOs are a real, material, physical phenomenon, unidentifiable in conventional terms; that there is a clear intelligence behind the phenomenon; that the origin of UFOs is unknown; but the extraterres- trial hypothesis must rank high on the list of possibilities; that the government has information on UFOs which confirms their reality, but it has consistently tried to keep this fact hidden from the public; and that the government regards UFOs as a threat to national security, a point made very clear in, recently , declassified documents.\" PROPERTIES OF THE UFO PHENOMENON \"The crux of the argument between those who take the UFO phenomenon seriously and those who don't, reduced to its essentials,\" said Dr. J. Allen Hynek, \"is whether the UFO phenomenon represents something really new to us and to science, or whether the contents of all UFO reports can be explained in pedestrian terms and that, therefore, all serious talk about UFOs is just a grand illusion.\" Reprising a paper recently presented before that august body, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (Arthur C. Clarke and Isaac Asiniov, predictably, argued againsf UFOs), Hynek contended that the evidence of UFO reports .did suggest something new to the sphere of science. Using a computer and a specially prepared program, Dr. Hynek reviewed the contents of over 400 UFO cases, many of which he had personally investigated. \"Preference was given to United States cases,\" said Hynek, \"but many foreign ones were included when I felt the quantity and quality of the evidence warranted this. Furthermore, I graded the cases A, B, and C as to overall quality. Obviously, the latter is J. ALLEN HYNEK somewhat' .subjective , but, the experiment can be repeated by anyone, using material they select, and indeed I urge that they do.\"  ; • . 'For the UFO properties reported by witnesses, Hynek used a simple classification system, as an example, ,HV for \"hover\", AA for \"anomalous acceleration\", and so on. \"What were the results?\" Hynek asked. \"Many of the most frequently reported properties of the UFO phenomenon, as reported from over the world and by responsible and competent people, and those properties taken in combination, are different from the properties of those events, phenomena, and objects generally offered as explanations for the UFO phenomenon. The UFO phenomenon, therefore, represents new empirical observations and thus, by definition, does not fit into the present scientific paradigm. That should not come as a total surprise to the present audience.\" He then quoted Niels Bohr, the father of atomic physics, to the effect that \"Progress in science is impossible without a paradox.\" Continuing, Hynek added: \"It is the things that don't fit in with our customary thinking that lead JOHN SCHUESSLER to breakthroughs; those that fit merely lead to further refinements^ \"And no one, that is, no one who has diligently studied the subject, can doubt that in the UFO phenomenon we do have a first-class paradox. \"It is only a matter of time...as it was for all the other things and concepts that once were spurned and derided by contemporary science... before the scientific community slowly comes to' recognize the significance of the UFO phenomenon.\" CASH-LANDRUM MEDICAL EFFECTS , One of the properties the UFO phenomenon'does seem to display on rare occasion is the ability to affect,, deleteriously, the percipient's health. Nowhere has'.this been as dramatically demonstrated as in the remarkable Cash-Landrum case which took place near Houston the night of December 29, 1980. And perhaps no one was as well qualified to discuss its ramifications as MUFON's Deputy Director, John Schuessler of Houston, the case's chief investigator. Since most Journal readers are probably familiar .with the incident, at least in passing, only a brief summary will be given here. On the night in question, Betty Cash, 51, was behind the wheel of her 1980 Oldsmobile Cutlass. With her were Vickie Landrum, 57, in the passenger's seat, and .Vickie's grandson, Colby Landrum, aged 7, in the rear seat. Returning home to Dayton, on the Cleveland-Huffman road just north of Lake Houston, the three encountered a flame-emitting, diamond-shaped object hovering over the roadway. (Later, they discovered, the object was surrounded by helicopters.) They stopped and got out of the car. Betty was outside the longest, perhaps a total of 10 minutes, Vickie for some 3-5 minutes, and young Colby probably only for a minute. The object and helicopters then flew away. The medical effects began about an hour later and included headaches, .nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Within the week Betty was placed in a hospital where (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"'Symposium, Continued she was treated as a burn patient. About two weeks later her hair began falling out in clumps. Most of these and subsequent symptoms, said Schuessler, seemed to indicate exposure to a possible combination of electromagnetic radiation, including, provisionally, ultra- violet light, infrared, radio and microwave frequencies, and perhaps ELF (Extreme Low Frequency) field effects as well. \"Betty Cash, Vickie Landrum and Colby Landrum were apparently harmed by some type of flying device on December 29, 1980,\" said John in conclusion. \"An examination of the literature provides no clear-cut definition of an exact type of radiation that would cause all the effects described earlier in this report. However, ionizing radiation could possibly cause about 90 percent of the problem. Microwave radiation raises the number to about 99 percent. Infrared, ultraviolet, and the others would cover a lower percentage of the injuries. Unfortunately, no well defined data base exists to examine the combined effects of two or more types of radiation.\" PHILIP IMBROGNO THE BOOMERANG MYSTERY \"During the early months of 1983,\" said Philip Imbrogno, \"a most remarkable series of .UFO sightings took place in the counties of Westchester and Putnam, in southeastern New York, and in nearby Fairfield County, Connecticut. \"On March 24th,\" Philip continued, \"a low-flying, silent object the size of a football field with a boomerang-shaped pattern of lights flew over major highways and populated areas. As many as 15 towns reported the mysterious object hovering near their homes and illuminating the countryside with brilliant bluish-white beams of light. Traffic stopped during rush hours and hundreds watched as the mysterious boomerang flew directly over their heads.\" Philip, a high school science teacher and field investigator for CUFOS, said the case was'\"a classic one for ufology because it has the greatest number of witnesses compared to any other case in history since the great airship mystery of the , 1890s. We are dealing with close to over 300 reports of corroborating witnesses that our team personally interviewed.\" Needless to say, only a minimal amount of that material can be covered here, just as Philip himself was hard- pressed to cram eyewitness reports, slides, and theories into a meager hour's speaking time. But how much better to be embarrassed by riches than paucity in a field like this! The one case we will cover was the sighting made by a Mr. Bill Hele, chief meteorologist for the National Weather Service in White Plains, New York. On the night of the 24th, Hele was driving south on the Taconic State Parkway about 8:45 PM, when he noticed some very bright lights on the horizon. They were moving slowly, perhaps 200 mph, from east to west. Hele lost sight of the lights momentarily in a dip in the road. As he topped the hill, however, they were suddenly visible again, moving directly toward him. Still more curious than frightened, he pulled off to the side of the road, turned on his emergency flasher lights, and got out of the car for a closer, less hurried look. Hele could now see a formation of lights, about seven in all, in a wide V shape. \"As the object approached,\" Philip quoted Hele, \"I heard no sound at all. It then started to lower its altitude to maybe about 1000 feet...and then slowed to a crawl. All the lights then started to change color as if there was a rotating prism in them. \"Then all the lights just went out - they ceased to exist. I looked up for the object, hoping to see at least a dark outline, but saw nothing...About 40 more seconds elapsed and I am still looking up, scanning the entire sky hoping to see something, when 'Flash!' the entire string of lights came on and the object was almost directly overhead.\" By now Hele was more frightened than curious. But he remained where he was; gazing up at this thing overhead. \"Judging by the angle that the lights subtended in the sky, I estimated that the object was over 1,000 feet from wing-tip to wing-tip. The lights at this time were all green; a slimy green , like you see on a computer screen...I could see that quite a few cars had pulled over to the shoulder of the highway and people were getting out to look at the lights. \"Two men came running towards me from a parked car up ahead and said to me in a hysterical voice, 'Mister, do you have a camera?'...We then just watched as the object or lights slowly drifted north and was soon lost to view.\" Despite attempts by several witnesses to take pictures of the boomerang, only one good photograph turned up, taken by 17-year old Jeff Salmonease. of the Putnam Valley area. That photograph is reproduced on page 160 of the Symposium Proceedings. Thanks should be extended to Philip . Imbrogno and the other members of the investigative team who have managed to mobilize so much data about this intriguing and clearly important UFO encounter over a highly populated area of the country. LIGHT BEAMS AND SPACE-TIME PROJECTIONS Alan C. Holt, of Houston, noted that \"Numerous close encounter cases involve observations of beams of light emitted from UFOs. In many cases the UFO light beams produce very unusual electromagnetic, physiological, and 'lift' effects. Of particular interest are the light beams which are apparently responsible for lifting cars, light aircraft, (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Symposium, Continued and people. \"The light beams involved in producing these 'lift' effects are described as being very brilliant with unusually pure colors, very penetrating, and liquid-like in density. These characteristics suggest a projected energy beam distinctly different from a laser beam or other directed energy beams which are currently in use, but with some common characteristics. The observa- tions of light beams which stop in mid- air and extend or retract in a spatially confined cone pattern indicate that a unique space-time projection technique is involved.\" Holt, a research physicist and space engineer, suggested several ways such unusual effects might be achieved, including 1) Advanced holographic projection and multiple beam interference techniques 2) Sonic or ultrasonic beam effects 3) Electrostatic charging effects and 4) Magneto- hydrodynamic \"bubble\" or buoyancy effects. After reviewing several UFO cases in which projected light rays behaved curiously, Holt concluded that \"UFO light beams provide a unique opportunity for us to begin to understand what appears to be an advanced physics and technology.\" Such a technology, Holt noted, might prove inestimable in our exploration of space. \"Light beam 'lift' effects could be extensively used in satellite retrieval operations, space junk repulsion, large space structure construction, and air/water/ground vehicle and people rescue activities. We PAUL NORMAN ALAN C. HOLT should be energetically pursuing the development of light or directed energy lift capabilities, for the benefit of mankjnd.\" COUNTDOWN TO REALITY \"There is a wind of change blowing in Australia regarding the recognition of the UFO problem\" said Paul Norman, MUFON State Director for Victoris, and an associate member of CUFOS and the British UFO Research Association (BUFORA). Hopefully, that fresh breeze will soon waft its way into other areas of the world, the United States included. But to begin at the beginning, as Paul did, it should be noted that reports of UFOs \"down under\" date back to the 1920s, when the S.S. Amelia J. disappeared at a time unexplained lights were being seen at the entrance to Bass Strait, Victoria. A search plane was reportedly sent out to investigate the lights and it vanished, too. \"In 1930,\" said Paul, \"a squadron- leader was sent by the Royal Australian Air Force to Warrnambool, Victoria, where people had reported 'aircraft* flying over the coast. The official investigator found that the objects were not aircraft belonging to Australia or any other power. They could not even be identified as aircraft. In short, they were unknown flying objects.\" The same area, Bass Strait, has since become Australia's outstanding flap zone. UFO activity there reached an all time peak in September and October of 1978, culminating in the disappearance of pilot Frederick Valentich who, Paul said, \"had been reporting the approach and descriptions of an unidentified flying object as long as his radio transmissions could be heard. This encounter has. become the greatest mystery in Australian aviation history.\" Unfortunate as the case was for Valentich himself, it has apparently led to increased government co-operation with civilian UFO investigators like Paul Norman and other dedicated members of VUFORS. If it is a trend that other researchers around the world can one day anticipate, then Australia's actions will have been a landmark breakthrough indeed. Let us congratulate VUFORS and hope this proves to be the case. CYNTHIA HIND AFRICAN TRIBAL REACTIONS Congratulations are also in order for MUFON's Continental Co- ordinator for Africa, Cynthia Hind, who continues to labor in the field of ufology under difficult conditions, far from the moral and numeric support of fellow researchers in her adopted homeland of Zimbabwe, formerly Rhodesia. On the other hand, Cynthia has been gifted with a \"sterile laboratory\" of sorts, in that native sightings of UFOs tend to be void of what might be called the contamination of a Western, technologically-oriented background. In this light, it is interesting to note that while local reports of unusual lights, entities, landing traces, etc., closely parallel their Western counterparts in most aspects, they are interpreted according to traditional cultural and psychological belief systems. Thus astronauts and/or extrater- restrials are not interpreted as such, (continued on next page) 8"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"'LIGHT PUZZLE IN PERTH, AUSTRALIA The following, a preliminary report by Adrian De Jong, special investigator for the Perth UFO Research Group, is reprinted from the January-February 1984 issue (Volume 5, No. 1) of UFO Research Australia Newsletter. At 3 AM during the morning of Friday, January 20, 1984, Police Constables Tim Moffitt and Mark Fleskens, both from Midland Station, were travelling north along the Roe Highway, near Hazelmere, when they were startled by a bright white flash of light. Another flash followed within seconds and Constable Fleskens, the passenger, believing the light came from within the cabin of their van, began searching for the source. While Constable Fleskens was searching, and had his head down, Constable Moffitt witnessed a large green and white light which hovered for two seconds above Midland. It appears that the police radio in the van may have failed at the time the strange phenomenon manifested itself, for officers with communications headquarters in Perth said they could Symposium, Continued but rather as tribal spirits, benign or malign, of course, depending on their behavior. These spirits are closely akin, however, to our notions of ghosts and are sometimes viewed as the departed spirits of relatives. It also seems to be a part of local tradition that such spirits can manifest simply as a glowing light or in a humanoid form. Much work remains to be done in this field, as with most other areas of contemporary ufology. In the meantime, however, we can applaud Cynthia's efforts as those of a pioneer in the true sense of the word and look forward to her next report from the African continent.

Mr. Bishop saw two forks of light come out of the sky and, in the middle of these, a huge green, white and blue light appeared. The phenomenon was about 30 meters high with a 6-meter wide base. The light effect was first noticed in the corner of Mr. Bell's back- yard and seemed to come from above one tree. This tree and its neighbour were blowing around as if in gale-force winds which were confined to that particular area. The phenomenon was very brightly coloured bluish white and green. Its shape was hard to define because the light gradually lost its brightness on the oustide. However, it seemed to be conical in shape. Appearing in the sky, on either side, at the same time, were bright \"zig- zag\" vertical lines and three \"star\" like lights which were on the right above the zig-zag and formed a straight, but tilted line. They were approximately 36° above the southern horizon, about 20° southwest. The phenomenon disappeared with a \"thump\" noise and, at the same time, the wind stopped and the zig-zag lines and three stars vanished. The tennants of the house, whose back-yard is adjacent to that of Mr. Bell's, noticed the bright light shining but didn't see the source. They, too, were aware of the gale-forced wind and said that both effects vanished with a sort of \"bang.\" Additionally, they noticed their electrical clock \"blinking\" as if there had been a blackout. Several other residents in the area reported trouble with clocks and lights going on and off. There were reports of some people suffering mild electric shocks from metal objects and a microwave oven reportedly blinked on and off. Additionally, local dogs howled. According to the Weather Bureau, there had not been a gale-force wind in the area at that time. The physical effects noted here are for the information of readers only as investigations are still underway. The investigations of the Perth UFO Research Group are continuing."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"MULTIPLE-WITNESS PHOTO CASE By RAY STANFORD Article « 1984, R. Stanford Photos \" 1984, M. Chamblee The small town of Llano, Texas, is located about 75 miles northwest of Austin on state highway 71. It was there on the night of February 22, 1984, that architect Michael Chamblee, 38, and his wife, Therese, 37, saw a strange pattern of maneuvering lights. Provoked by the sighting, he decided to keep his Minolta SRT 101 35mm camera handy and loaded with Tri-X film. Should something more happen, he was determined to have other than memory to prove it afterward. About six weeks later, on Tuesday, March 20, at around 7:30 PM, keeping the camera ready paid off. Michael and Therese were dressed up and heading out for a Chamber of Commerce dinner. As they walked toward the car, Mrs. Chamblee pointed into the north sky and asked her husband about a bright \"object\" coming in their direction from the north. Initially, Michael thought they were seeing a single object with two lights substantially brighter than those normally seen on aircraft. A red light that alternately dimmed and brightened every two or three seconds, but which never blinked on and off, gleamed in the night sky in a position several arc minutes away from and to the observers' left of a steady white light. Approaching from true north, along an estimated 351° magnetic azimuth (determined at the observation site later by the author with Chamblee), the two light sources approached until at about 30° elevation. 10 Chamblee Photo 5 (left) seems to show object rotated roughly 80 degrees to observers' left compared to image obtained in next photo. Photo 6 (right) enlarged 66 diameters, reveals a view looking more directly along the axisof lateral symmetry but with trailing erid (two bright light sources) elevated some degrees. In center, overlay drawings made from the two photos. Images are only approximate but show general shape and compare orientations, captured in final two photos. Up to this point, the white light seemed to be elevated a little higher than the red one, producing an imaginary line that made an angle of about 15° tilt relative to the horizontal. Suddenly, the white light on the right moved to a still more elevated position, resulting in an imaginary line connecting the two lights at a tilt, now, of about 30° relative to the horizontal. This position was maintained for perhaps two seconds. Then both lights began lateral arcs that resulted in the approximate transposition of their relative locations., , Thus, the white, steady, light that had been slightly elevated and on the observers' right went through an approximate 150° arc to the left. The pulsating red light that had been on the left side arced about 180° and ended up to the horizontal right of the other light. That maneuver completed, both lights continued moving. The white one travelled about 30° in a westerly direction to the observers' left, whereupon it quickly \"faded out.\" The pulsating red light seemed to move away not truly to the east but on a course more northeasterly. During the transposition maneuver, Michael Chamblee became pretty well convinced that the objects were truly anomalous and began taking photos .with the camera. He used an infinity setting, an aperture of f/1.4 on a 55mm lens at 1/60 second shutter speed. Unknown to them, only 600 to 700 feet away one of their five children, ten- year-old Erick, along with a neighbor . boy, had noticed the two unusually brilliant lights coming out of the north and had been puzzled and excited upon witnessing the transposition maneuver described earlier. Erick and the other boy had been playing beside a river about an eighth of a mile north of the Chamblee home. Meantime, Erick's father, uphill and south of the river, was clicking away with his camera. The first three shots, Chamblee felt, may have included both the red and the white light sources now moving away from each other. When the white light vanished, he was left with just the red pulsating light toward which to aim his camera for the final three shots before the red light became so dim with distance as to discourage further photographic attempts. It may be of interest to mention here a paradox which the author noticed upon examination of the original negatives made during the (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Chamblee, Continued Llano March 20 UFO event. The more distant and dim the red object became to the human eye, the more brilliant (with attendant saturated image on the negative) it became to the film emulsion! This phenomenon was not without precedent, for on the night of November 11, 1974, our Project Starlight International lab site crew had photographed two beautiful salmon colored (pink tinted with orange) UFOs which yielded photographic images that were increasingly saturated (bright on prints) in direct proportion to the increasing distance and dimness of the objects as perceived by the people doing the tracking. The Llano object — or at least the red one — seemed (from photo analysis) to have been rotating. This could account for the seeming \"pulsation\" (once every two to three seconds), as might be deduced by study of photos five and six, reproduced herewith. These were taken \"...no less than 1 two and no more than five\" seconds apart. We might postulate that Chamblee just happened to catch the red lights at increasingly brilliant positions, but this explanation seems strained. Neither can the \"paradox\" be due to any, hypothesized increase in ultraviolent radiation. Chamblee's images, as well as those obtained by P.S.I, in 1974, are clearly focused. Ultraviolent light cannot, be focused with standard glass lenses such as both Chamblee and P.S.I, used. Expensive quartz lenses would have been required to obtain a focus of ultraviolent light. Increasing infrared light with distance or some other more complex explanation might be hypothesized, but the phenomenon is one toward which UFO researchers using instrument 1 ation in the field as well as theoreticians might profitably give some attention. On-site measurements indicate that Chamblee's final photo of the six (frame 15A-16 on the film edge) was taken at about 28° elevation above an azimuth of 70° magnetic. Chamblee, a careful observer, pointed out that this particular elevation measurement may be slightly exaggerated due to the fact Chamblee family with (from leftl Erick, Jonathan and Stephen that the tree in that direction upon which his pointing of my angle finder was based had put out quite a bit of new foliage between March 30 and May 12, when the measurements were taken. Thus the object in photo six may have been a degree or more lower than the 28° measured later. That final snapshot is the most interesting of the six photos taken by Chamblee, and the object image seems better resolved or at least in some ways more easy to interpret in the considerable details that are evidenced. Shown here in 66-diameter enlargement when compared with the image's size on the original negative, we seem to see substantially more detail than Chamblee noticed during the 60 to 90 second sighting. Notice the two oval or hexagonal light sources that seem to be identical. Calculation based upon the filmed image size and other data suggests that the angular width of the two combined bright lights was roughly 2.5 minutes of arc. Compare that to the appfpxirriate 30-minute arch of the sun or moon. Could Chamblee have been expected to perceive a separation in two, tiny lights so close together and bright red in color, as seen against the dark night sky? What is known about human perception suggests that under the visual circumstances, it would have been very difficult for any of the four witnesses to have noticed that the red light had two side-by-side sources instead of just one. It is to the witnesses' credit that, after seeing the images resolved by the camera, they did not alter their \"memory\" to fit the more interesting filmed images. During the 1950s and '60s NICAP used to insist that anyone's UFO film must show precisely and only what the verbal report described. This naive requirement placed any report and filmed results that differed one against the other as at best of dubious value and at worst as absolute fakes. Any expert on the nature and limits of human perception or on the capabilities of modern .photography can quickly prove the fallacy of such pseudoscientific \"expertise.\" It is time UFO photo interpretation came out of the dark ages. The NICAP position was a purely defensive one, with little or no view toward understanding short-duration or high speed events that might be associated with UFO physics, regardless of the nature of the object or phenomenon being photographed. For some, it may have been justifiable by the emotional needs of an even less than \"fledgling\" UFO \"science\" during the '50s and '60s. But if \"UFO research\" is ever to do any meaningful study of visual observations coupled with genuine photographic records of the reported events, we had (continued on next page) 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Chamblee, Continued best get our experts in human perception and experts in analysis of photographic records to understand that problems of photographic interpretation can be very, very difficult and complex. This could be one of the few viable approaches toward understanding physical phenomena associated with genuine UFO observations and filmings. In fact, a careful look at the Chamblee photos reveals something at least suggestive of structure beneath the two bright ovals of light. The \"structure\" might be interpreted as roughly triangular with one vertex upward and the two bright light sources mounted upon it. If we accept this interpretation, then the base of the triangle is tilted slightly upward and to the left. Two dark streaks or bands seem to project symmetrically downward from the \"seven o'clock\" and the \"five o'clock\" positions of the left and right ovals of light, respectively. There may be similar dark bands or light obstructions located parallel to the aforementioned two and located just outside each of the two vertices of the seeming triangle base. These are more difficult to see due to their being against the night sky background, instead of against the light gray \"triangle\" as are the former two. If one overexposes in making a print of this photo, the division between those two bright oval or hexagonal light sources becomes much more distinct, visible as a dark division separating the two. Thus, the black-and-white image of the UFO in photo six may evoke in us thought of some weird delta-wing aircraft approaching the observer with two bright landing lights on its nose and with the under-body and under-wing areas lighted more subtly. But let us remember that the bright illumination was RED (not white as are landing lights) and the object was, after all, moving generally away from the observers. Over a period of years I have trained and directed Project Starlight International's synchronous camera crews during hundreds of training and practice sessions. We always used 12 \"live\" cameras taking \"instantaneous\" and \"time\" exposure photos of conventional aircraft, satellites, balloons, etc. In my evaluation of the Chamblee photos, I have reviewed hundreds of the practice films and their photographic prints. We never even once obtained a photographic image of any of the aforementioned conventional objects that in any way resembles the red object Chamblee photographed on March 20, 1984. Resultantly, it seems realistic to say that the photographic images Chamblee recorded were not taken of any known conventional aircraft, satellite, or balloon known to the author. If the dark \"striping\" on the dim, lower \"structure\" shown in Chamblee's photo six seems familiar to some readers, they may be consciously or unconsciously remembering two drawings on page 4 of the Center for UFO Studies' \"International UFO Reporter,\" January/Februrary 1983. The two drawings reproduced therein are not exactly identical but are the individual renditions of Mary LaMontague and Rose Messina, two of four witnesses to a \"close-range\" UFO sighting on September 30,1982, in the area of Exeter, New Hampshire. Of course, there are other cases of such dark stripes on objects and if any reader can point out a case even more closely resembling the Chamblee object, please communicate that to me at the address below. Both New Hampshire drawings suggest four or approximately four dark \"stripes,\" just as seem to be evident in the Chamblee photo(s). In photo number five, we see an image of the same two light sources more clearly recorded in photo six. It is reproduced here for comparison, and careful examination -thereof also reveals the two separate bright oval or hexagonal lights as well as an image of the same dim \"triangle\" beneath the lights, just as is shown more clearly in the next photo. Comparatively, the UFO image in photo five seems rotated roughly 80° to the photographer's left and also tilted at a different angle. Photo four, not reproduced in this article, also shows the triangular shape with some clarity. Much more could be said about and shown by reproducing all the six UFOs images. But for economics, it shall be sufficient to say that there are considerable images in the Chamblee photos that seem to correlate with anomalous images obtained in several still photos and even with motion picture films P.S.I, has recorded during several different UFO sightings. Perhaps space can be found in some future MUFON UFO JOURNAL for that study. In my not inexperienced opinion, the four known UFO witnesses in Llano are sincere beyond reasonable question. By nature, an architect must be a careful worker, and Michael Chamblee seems to have carried over his architectural precision in noticing and reporting details of the March 20 UFO photographic event. Finally, it is important to note that the UFO images in the Llano photos are consistently in or quite near the middle of the camera's field of view. We are involved here with truly anomalous images, not with photographic \"artifacts,\" lens flares, etc. The Chamblee film was processed at the standard 400 ASA for Tri-X film by Jerry Bethel of Llano, as there are no professional labs there. Bethel is an amateur, but the negatives turned out to be fairly clean, with only a few minor scratches, mainly along edges, well away from the frame center where Chamblee had positioned the UFO via the viewfinder. No properly focused, enlarged images of the UFO(s) were produced until Chamblee gave me the original negatives for study and enlargement. Without the photos, the Chamblee-Llano sighting would be just one more \"nocturnal light\" case of little interest. But because the architect felt compelled after his initial sighting to carry a loaded camera, we now have new photographic images (especially of the red object involved) that are interesting because of the structure and phenomena they seem to reveal. Few credible nocturnal UFO photos show other than a blob or blobs of light, usually image-smeared.

RAYRHEIN At about 11 o'clock on a warm Sunday night in late August 1983, Helen Conrad, a security firm secretary, went upstairs to the bedroom of her 12-year- old daughter, Synthia. Before saying goodnight and turning off the lights, Mrs. Conrad looked out of the window next to Synthia's bed. As she viewed the rural countryside just south of Vienna, North Carolina, she noted that the whole neighborhood had settled in for the night and the starlit western sky gave a peaceful quietness to the scene. It was truly a pleasant evening. As she started to turn away, something odd caught her eye. \"I noticed a small ball of light slowly moving through the sky, heading north across the background of stars,\" Mrs. Conras told me. \"This puzzled me, and, thinking it was an optical illusion or glare from the room light, I quickly turned away and Chamblee, Continued exceptional. Additionally, the UFO shape suggested by the recorded image is very unlike the typical cartoon image of a domed disc. In short, it is sfrange. To the author at least, that makes it not only more interesting but almost convincing. Those who, unlike Chamblee, are inclined to fake UFO photos usually try to show us precisely what they think we want to see, the more legendary UFO. Following my advice, Michael Chamblee is preparing to register his copyright to the March 20,1984, photos with the Library of Congress, hoping to prevent misuse of the images he has obtained. The photos should be considered his copyright property, registration pending. Persons wishing to communicate either with Chamblee or with me concerning this photographic case should write either of us in care of Project Starlight International, P.O.

My first thought was that this was some kind of aircraft light.\" This response was understandable since the Smith-Reynolds Airport is only 9 miles east of her house. Then the light stopped still. At that point it was approximately the size and intensity of a large star, but it did not pulsate, fade, or diffuse. \"My next thought was perhaps a helicopter was in the area,\" she said. \"Wouldn't that explain why the light's movement could stop so suddenly?\" This also was an understandable response, especially to anyone familiar with the visual effects military helicopters produce while on night exercise. Suddenly the object's color changed from white to brilliant red, and it started flashing and gradually growing larger until it was comparable to a large headlight. \"Immediately I realized that whatever it was had changed direction and was heading due east, coming directly toward my house. Now I knew Artwork by Simone Mendez this was no airplane, it surely wasn't blinking like one,\" she said emphatically. Suddenly the thing burst into a series of multicolored lights — white, red, green, then yellow, and an occa- sional blue. Mrs. Conrad said it remind- ed her of an array of tri-colored lights on top of police vehicles. They seemed to be rotating in a counter-clockwise direction around the edge of a dark circle. The overall effect was one of a slow spinning, like a circus merry-go- round. \"The distance of the lights was difficult to determine in the darkness,\" Mrs. Conrad said, \"but I now felt intuitively that these lights were part of something else, something real and solid. \"Next, the fantastic aerial maneuvers began, almost too exotic to describe.

Look out there - that's not a plane!\" Synthia, sensing the excitement in her mother's voice, jumped out of bed and peered out the window. As if waiting for Synthia to find it, the mystery ship suddenly slowed down and stopped dead still. It remained stationary for almost a full minute, its lights slowly rotating around the center. , Then it began moving again slowly towards the house. Its lights dimmed and the color band suddenly turned dark red as it stopped again above the • trees. , . • -  • ,  ' ••'•'• \"It sat there in the air, hovering and tilting from side to side ever so slightly,\" Mrs. Conrad said. \"It.was scary and exciting at once. I could now see its lights illuminated something solid, something round. It had . an indeterminate number of lights all blending together around its midsection. The reflected light from the hull gave me the impression it was smooth metal. \"Then, as if to help my study, its lighting swiftly changed to a pale yellow- orange. Incredible as it may sound, there, several yards away, bathed in a pale light, appeared a solid object of considerable size, shaped like a disc somewhat flattened on the bottom. The lights now came out of a series of windows that reminded me of a brightly lit Pullman car. The whole thing looked smooth, no protrusions or appendages.\" Telling her daughter to keep watch, she hurriedly left the bedroom to grab the nearest phone. Although it seemed like hours since she had first seen the light, only five or six minutes had actually passed. She reported what they were seeing to the Forsythe County Sheriffs Office, and asked whether anyone else had reported the unusual aerial lights. To her relief, the sheriffs department treated her call 14 seriously: The dispatcher immediately • radioed the nearest patrol car and also contacted me so I might possibly catch sight of the unknown object. While her mother was on the telephone, Synthia saw the object perform a new maneuver. She said it began with a shallow climb and a brightening of the lights; then it shot upward, its lights turning to a brilliant sparkling yellow. It turned on edge, creating a wheel of vivid light rolling briefly across the night sky. This was followed by rapid spinning while the craft flew in circles. By the time Mrs, Conrad returned to the window, the UFO had descended to a point apparently 25 feet above land behind a 70-foot oak tree, about 2,500 feet from the window. An estimate based on subsequent measurements suggested that the object was 30 to 50 feet in diameter and was approximately 1,000 feet above the ground at this point. Finally, as Mrs. Conrad and Synthia watched, the object accelerated upward, the colors and intensity dimming. When Deputy Ray Bottoms arrived in about 10 minutes and they pointed it out to him, it had diminished to the size of a large star. Soon it became a pinpoint of light and was lost in the starry sky. Both Mrs. Conrad and her daughter mentioned a curious thing during my interview with them, the almost eerie quiet as they watched the alien object execute its acrobatics. They also reported the absence of any exhaust: no flame, no smoke, no vapor trail. A check with the Smith-Reynolds Airport revealed no record of anything unusual in the' sky that night. No ad- planes were scheduled, no low level military operations were in the area, no night balloon launches. A spokesman for air traffic control said visibility was excellent to 10 miles, and they had no unusual contacts in the sighting quadrant between 10 PM and 11 PM. The tower closed at 11 PM.  ; This case does not appear to satisfactorily fit any of the stock explanations like misidentificatiori of aircraft or stars, atmospheric phenomena, hoax, hullucinations, etc. Just what Mrs. Conrad and Synthia observed in the night sky may never b^ identified positively. One thing is certain, it adds to the records piling up for the unsolved UFO mystery.

By ANN DRUFFEL Parti Some UFO researchers direct their main attention to the puzzle of UFO propulsion. This is natural for- technically-trained persons who are exploring the phenomena of objects , which seemingly fly in a manner which often apparently defies known physical laws. Other researchers who are .not physical scientists or who have no specialized technical nowledge are also, naturally, interested in how the UFOs are propelled. But such researchers' curiosity about this facet of the UFO phenomenon is limited to vague impressions that they \"defy gravity\" or \"tap the earth's magnetic field\", etc. My own education and training was in the social sciences, but over the past 26 years I have repeatedly run into references in UFO literature which mention a specific earth element, the liquid metal, mercury. These references are in books, articles in both popular magazines and research journals, newspaper clips, and a personally investigated CE III case. Perhaps a person educated in the social sciences is not prepared to suggest clues as to how UFOs are propelled. However, my specialty of correlation of UFO information may give clues to others. '., Mercury, as'we know, is the only metal which is liquid at ordinary temperatures. It occurs native and in other compounds. It is released by roasting cinnabar, for example, and condensing the vapors. It is also known by the popular name \"quicksilver.\" Mercury, in Roman mythology, was the god of commerce, roads and travel. He was also the messenger of the gods. He was noted for being rather crafty and deceptive at times, even a trickster or thief when need arose. Mercury's gift of flight was smybolized by his winged sandals and a broad, winged hat. He also carried a winged staff This Roman god also became associated with magic and science, although how this gradation came about seems as mysterious as the origin of the god himself. His Greek equivalent is Hermes, who had basically the same traveling equipment and symbolized the same aspects of man's culture — travel, commerce, messenger from the gods, etc. I include these facts about Mercury as an ancient god mainly because myths have often been found to contain grains of truth, if one searches deeply into them. We might ask ourselves, why was \"Mercury\" the god of travel and flight? The earliest reference I found to the metal mercury, as associated with UFO propulsion was in a book by Harold T. Wilkins. My personal library does not contain all the Wilkins books which discuss Fortean and UFO phenomena, but recently my colleague Raymond Bayless directed me to passages in one of Ivan T. Sanderson's books which contained similar material. The ancient Sanskrit writings, particularly those portions called the \"Manusa\" (supposedly factual), contain descriptions of a war 1 between two civilizations who lived on earth many thousands of years ago in antedeluvian times. According to that portion of the Manusa called Samarangana Sutradhara, their defense systems had arsenals of what sounded like atomic weapons, and they also had the power of flight in vehicles called \"vimanas\". These were flying craft of various sizes which used mercury as an essential element in their propulsive systmes; 1 In 1964,' some years after becoming interested in active field investigation, I read about UFO sightings in Rio Vista, a small town in northern California. The Rio Vista newsclip was given to several southern California researchers by Idabel Epperson of Los Angeles. She taught many of us and generously shared her information, intellect, and philosophy as well as her magazines, journals and newsclips. Out of two newspapers in towns surrounding Rio Vista came reports of a flat, elongated craft, from the sides of which came streaks of fire. 2 , 3 The object, which was witnessed on May 16, 1964, was seen to touch the earth, leaving behind scorched ground. It departed in a red haze and was reported to the Rio Vista police by Mrs. Walter McKarley and her three sons, Alan, Bruce and Brent. The large object, which seemingly paralleled the movement of their family car, had a smaller object which seemed to be associated with it, somewhat in the manner of a \"remote-sensing\" device, according to the witnesses. At least a dozen other persons independently reported seeing the object. Although the fact was not mentioned in the newsclips, Idabel learned later from a northern California investigator that the object had hovered in and around an oil field and that the next day considerable quantities of mercury, which were used in, the oil wells' machinery, were missing. As interesting as this fact was, no further information was forthcpming. Time .passed, and references to mercury associated with UFO sightings continued to surface. On December 13, 1973, 16-year-old Patrick Thrush was reportedly driving near his home in Braderton, Florida, when he saw a brilliant object hovering over a river. A tube was protruding out of the object into the water. Patrick took two pictures of the object, which immediately pulled in the tube and swooshed over his car, dropping three warm lightweight rocks which had the appearance of lava. 4 (continued on next page 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Druffel, Continued Patrick was not an ordinary 16- year-old. He was a former science fair winner, a student of higher math and physics who had designed and built custom electronic equipment. He reported that when the object passed low over his car, it emitted a bluish-green glow. As it turned southward, it changed to a.red color and disappeared. Two independent witnesses some distance away saw the bright object departing and one of these saw, below the bright light, two smaller lights which merged into the larger object. Patrick not only reported the object; he went further. Based on what he had observed (and apparently using intuitive skill?) he theorized that the craft was navigated by \"magnetic push- pull\". He referred to \"an incomplete MIT concept\" called a mercury pool in which, according to his statements, a nuclear fusion device provides heat between two mercury pools. The pools rotate in opposite directions, he explained, creating a magnetic force between them. He theorized that some type of shield or conductor directed the force to propel the craft. He also theorized that the power for the fusion device might be deuterium or tritium (heavy hydrogen). These, he pointed out, could be processed from ordinary water, and he has observed the craft apparently drawing up water from the lake via a tube. I never found out if the Thrush case was proved genuine or not. The rocks and photos were presumedly analyzed by scientists but, to my knowledge, no definite conclusions were published. The newspaper clip went into a file which I had now labelled \"References to Mercury.\" I searched scientific references in the library with the competent help of an interested librarian, attempting to find published material about the alleged \"incomplete MIT concept\" mentioned by Thrush, but we were unable to find any scientific literature which seemed to fit. Time passed, and then in the scientific journal Cnem/sfry 5 I happened upon a reference to research by Ronald T. Gillespie and associates of 16 McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario (Canada), who had claimed to have found a new way to convert mercury into .a gold-like metal. Although nuclear accelerators had been known to convert small amounts of base metals, such as lead and mercury, into true gold by nuclear transformation at stupendous cost, Gillespie's method used conventional chemical techniques. Metallic mercury was treated with arsenic pentfluoride in liquid sulphur dioxide, and the mercury was transformed into a crystalline material with a golden appearance. Its empirical formula, however, was not AU (gold) but the \"rather mysterious Hg2.85ASf6\". According to the article, the X-ray diffraction photograph of this compound is even more unusual. It was ascribed to linear rows of mercury atoms in two non-intersecting perpen- dicular directions, while AsF 6 - octahedra are spaced regularly between them. These metal rows apparently accounted for \"the compound's surprising electrical conductivity\". In discussing the above, consider the following as possible correlations with what we know about UFOs: 1. repeated references to mercury in un- conventional propulsion systems; 2. even more frequent references to \"sulphur\" odors associated with UFO sightings (is there a possible correlation here with the sulphur dioxide used in Gillespie's experiments?); 3. the mysterious and apparently easy rearrangement of atoms associated with the element mercury, at least in this particular experiment; 4. the compound's high degree of electrical conductivity, (if, theoretically, it might ever be used in an (atomic?) propulsion system also involving electro- magnetism). Admittedly I was swimming in the dark, but decided to venture further into the unknown blackness. I remembered a case in South America where a UFO had been witnessed, apparently in trouble, over a city. It dribbled liquid metal, afterward identified as tin, then \"recovered\" and sped away. Remembering Gillespie's reference to mercury atoms being rearranged in \"mysterious\" formations by interaction with arsenic pentafluoride in sulphur dioxide, I wondered if tin might be a byproduct of an engine employing atomic reaction, using (radioactive) mercury as a basic fuel. I consulted scientific sources, who informed me that it was unlikely that the two elements — mercury and tin — could be involved in the way suggested. If mercury had been made radioactive for the purpose of an atomic engine, the two elements are still 30 places away from each other on the atomic scale. An element is changed by taking away or adding protons and neutrons. In earth science, light elements are used for atomic reactions, since they are reactive (easier to take away protons and neutrons). But mercury is a heavy element. I wondered if perhaps UFO entities didn't have to use light elements if their propulsion systems involved atomic energy. After all, might not mercury, having more electrons and protons than many other elements, be preferred as a sheer matter of economy, all well as being easy to handle because of its fluidity? This reference stayed in the \"Mercury\" file, which was growing thicker as years passed. But in 1965 another possible clue, not recognized as such at the time, had surfaced. My husband Charles and I had interviewed a close encounter witness for NICAP who claimed to have met the occupants of a large flying saucer near a large city in the southwest section of our country, to have been taken for a ride and given information about the workings of the propulsion system of the craft. 6 The witness had specifically mentioned that a substance \"that looked like Mercury\" was involved in the alien machinery. A careful investigation of the report was made, but no verification of the witness' claims was found. The witness, whom we will refer to as M.C., described with some precision, the manner in which the craft was propelled and had furnished a few drawings related to this.

Swords The goal of this report is to explore the psychiatric literature on the nature of'hysteria,\" and to begin to determine whether the loosely used explanations of \"mass hysteria,\" hysterical neurosis, hysterical contagion, or \"status inconsistency\" have any important relevancy to UFO experiences. Let's also take a look at the woefully sparse UFO literature on the subject. When you begin researching this topic you run into several surprises, which make you wonder whether you should even bother going on: examples... 1. The psychiatric profession hasn't quite made up its mind as to whether \"hysteria\" even exists. Some books define it as \"a name once used for a variety of neuroses.\" The word \"hysteria\" even disappeared entirely from the psychiatrist's \"Bible,\" the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, in 1952.

Can so-called \"mass hysteria\" account for some multiple- witness . UFO sightings, as some debunkers claim? We asked Michael D.

This is the first in a series of three articles on his findings. reappeared in the 1968 edition under several headings. 1 More about these later. This confusion stems from the revolution taking place all across psychiatry today. Old terms such as \"epilepsy,\" \"schizophrenia,\" \"hysteria\" and many others are being recognized as vague concepts at best — \"garbage\" words into which a multitude of poorly understood organic and environmental problems have been grouped. The task of modem psychiatry and medicine is to unravel a very tangled group of knots. 2. What we usually picture in our minds when the word \"hysteria\" is mentioned (individuals screaming uncontrol- lably and a movie hero smacking them in the face) seems to have little or nothing to do with \"hysteria\" as currently described. Also, \"crowd panic,\" a la the \"fire in the crowded theater\" (whether there is a real fire or not), seems to have little or nothing to do with hysteria. It is certainly not what the psychiatrist means by \"mass hysteria.\" 3. The relevant UFO- literature on the topic is nearly non-existant, and, worse, doesn't seem to have understood the current thinking on the subject before commenting. The most significant published remarks relating to hysteria in the UFO- literature, and available to the author, are Mark Rhine's chapter .in the Condon Report, 2 Robert Hall's and Grinspoon and Persky's chapters in UFOs: A Scientific Debate, 3 Donald Warren's article on \"Status in Consistency,\" 4 and the chapters'by Phillis Fox and Ronald Westrum in Haines' UFO Phenomena and the Behavioral Scientist, 5 which include comments on Warren's ideas. Hmm. Well, you can see why one might wonder if it's worth going on. The psychiatrists admit that they don't know what we're talking about, we don't seem to know what we're talking about, and our UFO writers, understandably therefore, may not know what we're talking about either (as regards \"hysteria,\" anyway). So,, should we just pack it up and forget it? If this author had any sense that's probably what he'd do, but let's give it a try anyway. Let's see what unravelling we can do. Here's our procedure: First, we find out what the psychiatrists think that they do know about the various forms of hysteria (as painlessly as possible); second, we eliminate those syndromes .which seem to have very little relevance to our phenomena; third, we take a good close look at \"mass hysteria\"; and, fourth, a close look at \"dissociative hysteria\" while including some comments on how the \"status inconsistency\" theory is related to the syndromes. Hang in there, folks, this won't hurt a bit. What the psychiatric profession feels that it knows. When reading the prominent (continued on next page) 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Swords, Continued texts, handbooks, and manuals, the constellation of hysterical syndromes seems to break down as in the following list:* 1. hysterical neurosis, conversion type; 2. hysterical neurosis, dissociative type; 3. hysterical psychosis; 4. Briquet's syndrome, or \"St. Louis\" hysteria; 5. mass psychogenic illness 6. hysterical personality; and, although not classed as hysteria: 7. group anxiety or phobic reactions, as in a crowd panic. Let's combine our first two tasks (knowledge and elimination) for a bit here to save time, patience, journal space, and our own sanity. Number 1, hysterical neurosis of the conversion type, seems not too pertinent to our field of study. Why? It is characterized by very obvious, even spectacular, loss of functions of specific body parts despite the absence of any organic dysfunction in those parts. Limb rigidity, or deafness, or blindness, would be examples of these occurrences. Uncontrolled motor movements (dyskinesias) are another symptom. Visual hallucinations and internal delusions are hot part of the core of this syndrome. Number 3, hysterical psychosis is probably \"out\" as well. Attaching the word \"psychosis\" to hysteria implies that the individual is seriously out of touch with reality. Now, some skeptics might feel that that is precisely the description of some UFO experiences, but the psychiatric profession is unlikely to agree. Why? Hysterical psychosis is not a one-time episode of fantasy and delusion, but an on-going recurrent syndrome described as \"blatantly obvious\" and resistant to\" normal psychotherapy. It often involves MUFON 103 OLDTOWNE RD. SEGUIN, TX 78155 \"re-run\" acting out of traumas in a trance-like state, which are sometimes mistaken for convulsions. Number 4, Briquet's syndrome, has been recently detailed by a team at Washington University of St. Louis, thus the nickname \"St. Louis hysteria.\" It, too, seems largely irrelevant here. It is a type of conversion hysteria dealing with a cluster of psychosomatic complaints, and having a recognizable \"home environment\" (for example, alcoholism, socio-pathy in spouse) as its breeding ground. This leaves us with four potentially important conditions. We'll deal with \"mass psychogenic illness\" first, and include remarks on \"crowd panic\" as we go into \"MPI.\" Secondly, we'll take on \"dissociative hysteria\" with inclusions about \"status inconsistency\" and \"hysterical personality\" when appropriate. Mass hysteria As mentioned above, the modern term for \"mass hysteria\" is \"mass psychogenic illness\" or MPI.\" 7 Although a rare and amazing sequence of envets, at least two dozen such clusters of hysteria have been closely studied. Through these cases a pattern has emerged and some understanding of underlying causes is now available. As perhaps a necessary aside, we should list a few other names this phenomenon has been given, since the quotes which follow do not use the same terms: \"hysterical contagion,\" \"epidemic hysteria,\" \"group hysteria,\" \"mass conversion reactions,\" and \"collective delusion.\" Now the patterns seen... Let's start with a quote from the investigators of one of the most famous cases of MPI, the \"June Bug Incident\": \"A case ofhystericalcontagion...is one in which a set of experiences or behaviors which are heavily laden with the emotion of fear of a mysterious force are disseminated thorugh a collectivity. The type of behavior which forms the manifest content of the case may vary widely from one example to the next, but all are indicative of fear, and all are inexplicable in terms of the usual standards of mechanical, chemical, or physiological causality.\" 8 So, the prime ingredient is fear, and the \"symptoms,\" whatever they turn out to be, are inexplicable on usual physical or \"organic\" grounds (i.e. they are psychologically generated). The \"contagious behavior\" usually begins with a single case, which is often a day or more removed from the acceleration of the symptoms which is the \"epidemic.\" The first case is the \"trigger event\" and contains within it something which may cue the future cases to begin (for example, a bug bite, an odd odor). Once the second and third cases occur the phenomenon spreads rapidly, cases occurring within minutes of each other at the \"contagion's\" peak. After the MPI peaks and \"bums out,\" a smaller \"rebound\" peak may occur involving \"repeaters\" (individuals affected previously). In a week or so the phenomenon ceases entirely. In the \"June Bug\" case, involving the \"typical\" MPI symptoms of nausea, nervousness, weakness, and numbness, 50 cases occurred in the peak two-day period. The day prior, five cases occurred; the day after, four. The initial case occurred five days before the peak, and only two cases occurred in the \"tail\" of the phenomenon, three and five days later. The total time period: 11 days. This sort of time spectrum is not at all unusual. It is the typical pattern. So, what else can we say? Typical symptoms have been mentioned above. What other \"behaviors\" might occur? Headaches are very common. Occasionally screaming, struggling and violence are present. Unexplained laughter may appear, and feelings of cold and dizziness. There is often some paranoia. More dramatic or spectacular phenomena, such as \"possession,\" \"trance speaking,\" or \"running amok\" will occur only when a cultural matrix has created the precedences for such bizarre actions.

The strange beings, described as being about 20 inches tall, with pointed ears, bulging eyes, no nose and a slit-like mouth, were first seen by children and then were seen by police officers investigating the reports. There have been numerous UFO sightings in the area during recent years. The ENQUIRER'S July 17 issue reports on the experience of a British fisherman who was taken aboard a UFO and examined, but was declared to be \"too old and infirm\" for the purposes of the UFO occupants. The July issue of FATE tells of a 1982 UFO demonstration in Lancashire. Large cigar-shaped objects and other UFOs were reported by several people in the town of Abram in Lancashire. The concept of UFOs as a natural phenomenon is discussed in the \"Anti- Matter/UFO Update\" column of July OMNI. Michael Persinger's view that 85 percent of UFO sightings can be explained in such a manner is highly questionable, but the \"earthlights\" theory might account for a small number of UFO reports.

Pobst's booklet on this subject, SWEDENBORG: A MANUAL, has now been published by Arcturus Book Service (263 N. Ballston Avenue - Scotia, NY 12302). In the sort of original research which, unfortunately, is so sadly lacking in this field, Pobst shows that Swedenborg's claims of contact with \"celestials\" contain many elements which are found in similar modem reports. Descriptions of subterranean bases and technology are startlingly similar to those given in Shaver's stories, but Swedenborg's visits to the \"underworld\" occurred more than 200 years earlier. This booklet is highly recommend- ed, as are two other works by Pobst, SHAVER: RESHARPENED (an overview of the \"Shaver Mystery\") and A CHECKLIST OF THE FICTION OF RICHARD S. SHAVER. The Swedenborg booklet is $6.95, the Shaver summary is $5.95 and the CHECKLIST is $2.75 (add 85 cents for the first item; 35 cents for each additional item). Those of you who have been content with the glib (and nonsensical) criticisms of the Eduard Meier contact case will probably not want to read any further. Yes, I am going to tell you that there is another book available, UFO...CONTACTTHEMFROMTHE PLEIADES, Volume II. I am also going to tell you that anyone with any pretention of openmindedness should read this book, as well as the others dealing with this case, before making a decision concerning the truth of Meier's claims. As with its predecessor, Volume D is a \"picture-book,\" composed largely of the Meier photos, along with other photos and illustrations pertinent to the case.

Our service was started in 1969, at which time we contracted with a reputable international newspaper-clipping bureau to obtain for us, those hard to find UFO reports (i.e., little known photographic cases, close encounter and landing reports, occupant cases) and all other UFO reports, many of which are carried only in small town or foreign newspapers. \"Our UFO Newsclipping Service issues are 20-page monthly reports, reproduced by photo-offset, containing the latest United States and Canadian UFO newsclippings, with our foreign section carrying the latest British, Australian, New Zealand and other foreign press reports. Also included is a 3-5 page section of \"Fortean\" clippings (i.e. Bigfoot and other \"monster\" reports). Let us keep you informed of the latest happenings in the UFO and Fortean fields.\" For subscription information and sample pages from our service, write today to: UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE Route 1 — Box 220 Plumerville, Arkansas 72127 samples of supposedly extraterrestrial origin, as well as analysis results of claimed spacecraft sounds and new information concerning the photos and films taken by Meier. This is a beautiful book, done in the same format as the previous volume, 72 pages in length (12\" x 12\"), with much more text than Volume I. The investigators of this case have spent many thousands of dollars in an effort to present the evidence they have found. I, for one, welcome their contributions to the UFO subject.

Cliff Palmberg, host chairperson, and Ken Hank, assistant host chairperson, made the presentation and formal invitation to \"Meet Me in St. Louis.\" The theme for the symposium will involve a challenge to all of us while addressing the legal aspects of the much maligned \"Burden of Proof with respect to UFOs. The Chase Hotel (formerly the Chase-Park Plaza Hotel) was selected due to its fine accomodations, central location, eating facilities and parking. It is located directly across the street from Forest Park, which houses such famous sightseeing attractions as the St. Louis Zoo, one of the finest in the United States, and the outdoor Municipal Opera, where first-run musical stage shows appear throughout the summer season. ***** The Annual Picnic of the UFO Study Group of Greater St. Louis is scheduled for Sunday, August 19,1984, at Love Park in west St. Louis County. Your director and his wife plan to attend. ***** Several of our State Directors have responded to the suggestion that all of them appoint Assistant State Directors to not only strengthen their state organizations, but to identify their back-up. Robert E. Engberg has selected Walter J. Moe of Hastings, Minnesota, to be his Assistant State Director for Minnesota. Don Mason appointed Richard F. Suchocki of Couer d Alene, a State Section Director for the northern Idaho counties, to this additional post. Ray Boeche has identified Scott H. Colborn, presently a State Section Director, to assume this extended responsibility in Nebraska. Rev. G. Neal Hern, State Director for Texas, has approved the appointment of Thomas E. Spicer to be the State Section Director for Coma! County. Tom is a science teacher with a master's degree in the New Braunfels school system. Peter R. Geremia has selected Walter E. Friesendorf, living in Milford, New Hampshire, to be the new State Section Director for Hillsborough County, based upon the recommendation of Raymond E. Fowler, Director of Investigations. ***** The masthead of the May-June issue was revised to reflect additions and new assignments to the Journal Staff. Dennis Stacy, Director of Publications for MUFON, formerly a Staff Writer, became the new Assistant Editor. Thomas P. Deuley, MUFON Corporate Secretary, agreed to apply his artistic talent as Art Director. Simone C. Mendez, who contributed artwork for the April 1984 issue of the Journal, has joined the art staff. These steps are being taken to continue upgrading the quality of the MUFON UFO Journal so as to maintain its position as the leading monthly UFO magazine. ***** This issue has been identified as the July-August 1984 issue number 1% as a means of bringing the monthly cover date to a current status reflecting the status of the contents.
