FROM THE EDITOR Some subscribers are going to become spoiled, as we log in with another 28-page issue. Please don't. In fact, we are only anticipating a delayed and shorter December holiday issue, due to this editor's impending marriage and hopeful honeymoon, and the usual hassles that arise this time of year. The new year should see us back on a more or less normal schedule. In the meantime, what an issue we have on hand. The overall theme is one of reported UFO abductions, though that might not seem apparent at first. Actually, we examine the subject from several angles, beginning with Jerome Pearson's article on the likelihood, or rather unlikelihood, of extraterrestrial life in our galaxy, reprinted from the prestigious Enylish science weekly, New Scientist. Pearson's piece is followed by a penetrating article from our own Dr. Michael Swords which examines the even more unlikely possibility of hybridized offspring between aliens and humans. We present these articles not to demolish anyone's pet theories, but because they raise intriguing questions, and in some cases posit possible answers, that must be objectively considered by anyone promoting the opposite point of view. The same holds true of Dr. Michael Persinger's article on the neuropsychological aspects of the visitor experience. You may not instinctively agree with everything the good doctor has to say, but that in no way diminishes the proposition he puts on the table. The mind is at least as strange and unexplored as outer space, and who's to say which is the larger and more unknown of the two? Reverend Downing weighs in with another installment of the God Hypothesis, and Ann Druffel poses the question of whether or not passivity and subservience are the only available responses to the visitor experience. If that were not enough, we also have on hand all of our regular departments. Along with the usual holiday fare, we hope this latest issue of the Journal provides you with some timely food for thought.

The following approach by Jerome Pearson, an aerospace engineer and consultant, offers some intriguing suppositions on the subject. Pearson is presently chief of the structural dynamics branch of the US Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory. This article first appeared in the August 25, 1988, issue of New Scientist Maga- zine London, the weekly review of science and technology, and is reprinted with their gracious permis- sion. \"Where are the extraterrestrials? Why haven't they landed in their fly- ing saucers on the White House lawn to welcome humanity to the Galactic Club?\" Enrico Fermi asked this most pertinent question back in 1939, long before the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) began. In the past few decades, Fermi's question has taken on a new urgency as we have built powerful radio receivers and lis- tened to tens of thousands of ever- silent stars, and even sent our own planned and unplanned signals to unresponding planets. Fermi's paradox arises from a chain of apparently sound logic, obser- vations, and assumptions. The Milky Way is a pinwheel disc of stars, gas and dust about 100,000 light years across, rotating once every 200 mil- lion years. There are billions of stars in the Milky Way that are very much like the Sun, warm and long-lived. Many millions of these stars may be accompanied by planets, and thou- sands or even millions of the planets may be suitable for life. If life arises naturally, then we might expect thou- sands of living planets and perhaps hundreds of civilisations in our Galaxy. In the 1960s, Frank Drake, who was working at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, West Virgi- We could be alone in the Galaxy because the Earth and the Moon make up a unique double planet. Rare, giant moons such as ours may be necessary for the emergence of life. nia, created an equation to estimate the number of civilisations in the Gal- axy. This was based on reasonable guesses about the proportion of suit- able stars and planets, and the prob- ability that life, intelligence and civili- sation would develop. Any seemingly consistent set of numbers in Drake's equation predicts a multitude of life in the Galaxy. Our Galaxy is between 10 and 15 billion years old, so if there are civilisations, some of them should be much older than ours. Traveling a mere 1 per cent of the speed of light, their spaceships could have covered the entire Galaxy in a few million years. Yet an ever-expanding SETI program has found no evidence of any intelligence. There are no signs that they visited us, are on the way, or even that they are communicating among their many settled worlds. Fermi's paradox has become more of a mystery than ever. What are the possible answers? Over the past decade, many scient- ists have considered the possibilities. Those who believe in the quest for extraterrestrial intelligence, led by Carl Sagan of Cornell University, imagine that interstellar travel is diffi- cult or impossible, that spreading civ- ilisation is a slow and painful process, and that societies destroy themselves before they can reach us. This leaves us with the possibility of using radio to communicate with isolated socie- ties on other planets. Other scientists, such as Anthony Martin and Alan Bond of the Culham Laboratory, the United Kingdom Atom- ic Energy Authority's center for fusion research near Oxford, see the lack of extraterrestrials as proof that we are MUTUAL UFO Network Journal, Number 247, November 1988 alone in the Galaxy, if not in the Uni- verse. Many of these scientists use biology to argue that the occurrence of life by chance is so remote as to be unthinkable. Other scientists believe that evolution is such a random walk that no two intelligent species devel- oping on different planets could have enough in common even to recognise each other, much less to communi- cate intelligently. Perched somewhat precariously are those who deny the very existence 'of the Fermi paradox and insist that the Galaxy is teeming with life, just as Drake's equation predicts, and that extraterrestrials have visited us. They have not revealed themselves because they are studying us. An interstellar civilisation could know all there is to know about stars, planets and solar systems. The only unpredictable thing that could arouse their scientific curi- osity would be the extraordinary var- iety of alien life forms, and therefore they have set us aside in a \"zoo\" (or \"asylum\") for observation. The time is ripe for a fresh look at these contradictory theories. Some- thing is wrong either with our assump- tions or with our logic. One basic assumption is that of ordinariness. We assume that the Earth and its life are typical, placed in a moderate location in a typical solar system around an average star. Yet the Earth is not typical at all — it is uni- que in our own Solar System, for several reasons. The most obvious point is that the Earth and its Moon are more like a double planet than a primary and its satellite. The Moon is far larger com- pared with the Earth than any other 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"satellite of a major planet in the Solar System. Our Moon is so large that it does not actually go around the Earth at all; its orbit is always concave toward the Sun. Jupiter and Saturn have 317 and 95 times the mass of the Earth, respectively. Even so, their largest moons are hardly bigger than our Moon. Only Pluto and Charon represent another such pair, and they are so small that they are more of a double asteroid than a major planet and its moon. They may be the rem- nants of an escaped moon of Nep- tune ruptured by the violent upheaval that tore it from that planet. Alterna- tively, they may be part of a second asteroid belt that shades into the dis- tant, giant Oort Clouds of comets orbiting far beyond Neptune. Our large Moon has affected the Earth significantly. The ocean tides raised by the Moon had a profound effect on the evolution of crustaceans and amphibians. The emergence of tidewater zones, which alternate be- tween flooding and drying out, per- haps even helped life to emerge on land. A second anomaly is the presence of Earth's atmosphere and oceans, which are unique in the Solar Sys- tem. The amount of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere is far too much for chemical equilibrium. This unsta- ble condition is maintained by the constant action of living plants; with- out life, the oxygen would react with the materials on the surface and pro- duce carbon dioxide. The excess carbon is tied up in enormous beds of limestone and rocks containing other carbonates that were laid down millions of years ago. The oxygen not only supplies animals with energy so they can move and reproduce, but also creates and maintains the ozone layer that protects life from deadly ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. James Lovelock of the Coombe Mill Experimental Station in Cornwall developed the idea that life tries to moderate its local environment, creat- ing a feedback mechanism that keeps the Earth habitable. His hypothesis envisaged the planet as a giant living organism which he called \"Gaia\". This concept regards the Earth as a self-organising, self-regulating system 4 10 10 c 10 <D E o o Jupiter Saturn Uranus .2 0) (T 10 -4 10 Mercury Venus 10'' 1  10 2 Relative angular momentum 10° Figure 1. The magnetic fields of the planets usually depend directly on their rotational energy. The Earth's much higher field could result from tidal heating caused by capturing the Moon. that maintains enough oxygen for the animals and enough carbon dioxide for the plants. The Gaia mechanism keeps the ocean and the atmosphere at a moderate temperature by a con- trolled greenhouse effect, and by reg- ulating the recycling of materials needed for life — oxygen, water, soil and rock. It is not perfect, however, because the Earth still swings between warm periods and ice ages. Moon's Magnetic Effect The Earth also has a very powerful magnetic field. This field is much larger in proportion to its mass and the angular momentum caused by the Earth rotating than that in any other planet. Angular momentum is a mea- sure of the rotational inertia of a body; it is greater if the body is large, massive and rotates faster. If you could attach a giant lever to the cen- ter of the Earth and push on the end to stop the Earth rotating, then the angular momentum tells you how large a force you would need and how long a time you would have to push to stop it. The distances of the planets from the Sun are related by Bode's law, formulated in the 17th century. It depends on manipulating a sequence of numbers that double each step after the first. The strengths of the magnetic field of the planets are related to their rotation by a mag- netic version of Bode's law. Figure 1 shows this relationship for all the planets (not drawn to scale) out to Uranus, based on information gained during the Voyager 2 flyby in January 1986. It shows that the Earth is far above the nominal line encompassing Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Venus and Mars. The excess heating caused by the gravity of the Sun explains why Mercury is above the line. The Earth, however, has a field 100 times stronger than expected. Existing theories can- not explain this, even when we take into account the heating caused by the tidal action of the Sun and the MUTUAL UFO Network Journal, Number 247, November 1988"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Time Figure 2. Too hot and a planet becomes a runaway greenhouse; too cold and it freezes. Gaia, so the theory goes, creates feedback that maintains the moderate temperature necessary for life. Moon (at the Moon's present dis- tance from Earth). Another unusual aspect of the Earth is its active, molten core. The energy of this core drives the tectonic plates, recycles new crust from the interior, and releases the same kind of gases from inside the Earth as those that produced the present atmosphere. This molten core is responsible for all the volcanoes and mountain ranges, for the opening and closing of ocean basins, and for the separation of the continents, which has isolated gene pools and speeded up evolution. The Indian researcher U.R. Rao, of the Satellite Center in Bangalore, has noted that a magnetic field is vital in maintaining the ozone layer to protect life from ultraviolet radiation. Geologists have also disco- vered that many species become extinct during the times when the Earth's magnetic field reverses and its strength temporarily goes to zero. All these unusual characteristics of the Earth may be due to the pres- ence of our large Moon. According to a recent theory championed by Aus- tralian geologist Stuart Ross Taylor, the Moon is large because it is a remnant of the second largest pla- netesimal (the small bodies that coa- lesced to form the planets) in the cloud of debris that formed the young Earth. Normally, the larger planets grow at the expense of the smaller ones by collisions and by collecting debris from nearby orbits. The Moon may have been \"captured\" by the Earth during an unusual collision in which the Moon \"grazed\" the Earth. Such double planets are likely to be very rare because the overwhelming majority of \"orbital encounters\" result in either the complete shattering or merging of the two bodies after a colli- sion, or a simple flyby after a miss. For a billion years after its bizarre capture, the Moon was very close to the Earth; this proximity raised enor- mous tides on both bodies and heated their cores far above what would be normal for their rates of rotation. This prolonged heating con- tinued until the action of the tides pushed the Moon to nearly its pres- ent distance, and slowed down the rotation of the Earth from about 4 hours to 24 hours. The Earth does not follow the magnetic version of Bode's law because it was heated in the process of slowing down. The Earth and the Moon are obviously a rare case, but how rare? It is difficult to predict the likelihood of such double planets occurring, although there are some computer simulations that we could usefully modify to examine the problem. On MUTUAL UFO Network Journal, Number 247, November 1988 the other hand, there is some evi- dence in the Solar System for the existence of double planets. This evi- dence consists of miniature solar sys- tems, represented by the satellites of the giant planets, and the remnant planetesimals, represented by the aste- roids. Several moons are either locked into interweaving orbits with a twin body or with a ring of debris. In the jovian system, 1 out of 14 satellites shows such effects; in the saturnian system, 3 out of 13 show such a con- nection; and in the uranian system, 1 out of 14 is affected. So far, little is known about Neptune's moons, but Voyager 2 may change that situation when it flies past in September next year. Some of the thousands of known asteroids vary in brightness during the time it takes them to rotate. This variation might have been interpreted as closely orbiting bodies, but further analysis has shown that these objects are asteroids with complex shapes, like the asteroidal moons of Mars. These shapes were probably pro- duced when the asteroids collided with other bodies or were bombarded by planetesimals. There are as yet no confirmed double asteroids. Recent observations by Luke Flynn of the University of Hawaii showed that none of the 17 most likely candidates, including Ceres, Pallas and Vesta, had any companions. Nor was there any evidence of dust clouds around these asteroids. Collisions and close encounters during orbits have been common among these satellites and asteroids, as their cracked, scarred, and pitted surfaces show. However, not one of the many interactions has formed a double satellite comparable to the Earth/Moon system. All of them pro- duced either rings of debris or inte- racting bodies that keep their dis- tance. About one-tenth of the satellites have been affected; if these grazing collisions between satellites and aste- roids are rare, then perhaps only one in a hundred or one in a thousand planets will be part of a double act. REDUCED CHANCES This result alone reduces the expect- 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"ed number of habitable planets in the Galaxy to far below the millions for- seen by Drake. There is another fac- tor that could lower the number further. Studies of the Earth's climate show that even a small change in our average distance from the Sun could have turned the Earth into a runaway greenhouse or a cold, dry desert. The range of orbits where life is possible — the habitable zone — is small. A little closer to the Sun and we would fry; a little farther away and we would freeze (see Figure 2). It may be that the habitable zone is far smaller than astronomers thought, or even that there is no permanently habitable zone at all. The requirements for life can be summarised as follows: a strong mag- netic field is necessary so that the planet can become \"active\"; only an active planet offers protection from cosmic radiation, recycles crustal mater- ial, and produces oxygen by the release of gas from the interior. A single planet cannot develop such an internal field without being too mas- sive or rotating too rapidly to be able to support life. Even a double planet must develop life very quickly in order to forestall the instabilities of greenhouse effect or glaciation. All habitable planets are double, there- The implications for hu- manity are that we may be alone — this Galaxy belongs to us. Our spe- cies may be the only opportunity for life to spread across this Gal- axy. fore, and all single planets are uninha- bitable. This implies that there may be two types of terrestrial planets: the first type consists of double planets, with very strong magnetic fields, plate tec- tonics, tides, life, and stable (or mod- erate) climates; the second type con- sists of single planets, with weak magnetic fields, incomplete plate tec- tonics, and unstable climates that are either too hot or too cold. If this is correct, we may be alone, or one of a very few civilisations in the Milky Way. Any civilisation attempt- ing to colonise the Galaxy will find that every suitable planet is inhabited, and that every uninhabited planet represents a major challenge to make it habitable. This would delay consid- erably the colonisation of the Galaxy, perhaps long enough to explain why no other civilisation has reached us so far. This hypothesis, of course, has sig- nificant implications for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. It will be a long, difficult task; if there are only a few civilisations in the Galaxy, the nearest one may be tens of. thou- sands of light years away. SETI may be more successful in nearby galax- ies, such as Messier 31 in the constel- lation Andromeda, which represents billions of possible targets. The implications for humanity are that we may be alone — this Galaxy belongs to us. Our species may be the only opportunity for life to spread across this Galaxy. The American Indians made a very wise choice when they selected the words for treaties meant to last forever: As long as the moon shall rise, As long as the rivers shall flow, As long as the sun shall shine, As long as the grass shall grow. These words encapsulate the require- ments for life — a double planet with a large moon, a temperate zone where water can flow, a warm and lasting sun, and a system like Gaia to keep it so. Extraterrestrial Hybridization Unlikely By Dr. Michael Swords Dr. Swords is an associate pro- fessor of natural sciences at Wes- tern Michigan University, Kala- mazoo, and editor of the recently- revived Journal of UFO Studies. His last appearance here was a reader's guide to Communion (May 1987, No. 229). INTRODUCTORY REMARKS Much has been said in UFOlogy recently over claims of sperm and egg-taking during abductions, and of hybrid babies containing the genetics of both extraterrestrials and humans. 6 The contexts of these claims make them, if true, not far from the ulti- mate horror story. Comments made by parties interested in or actively researching these reports, concerning the possibility or impossibility of these claims, have been \"fast and loose,\" showing little familiarity or even care for the biology involved in the situation. As such, comments upon the real- ity of the hybridization claims have not been particularly helpful to UFOlo- gists trying to understand abduction reports, nor in aiding \"outsider\" scho- lars and researchers in taking them seriously. This article will attempt to clarify the salient points of genetic science as regards these claims, and will attempt to separate those hypo- theses which might be tolerated as possible explanatory concepts and those hypotheses whose naive repeti- tion will cost the UFO researcher severely in credibility with the edu- cated community. GENETICS 101 All higher animal organisms on the planet reproduce by means of sex. Regardless of what you or I might feel, the reason for sex is gene- MUTUAL UFO Network Journal, Number 247, November 1988"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"mixing. Mother Nature produces the varieties of differently endowed indi- viduals which give each species its flexibility and strength, because the females and males of each species select different halves of their per- sonal genetics to give to each new- born. In order to make this genetic transfer efficient and precise (proba- bly the only time that sex has been described in these terms), Mother Nature provides special cells (eggs and sperm) which contain half (rather than all) of the maternal and paternal genes in the form of solid manipulable structures called chromosomes. All of that you probably knew already, or the American education system has failed again. What is germane to our current topic that you might not know is: a) Different species often have different numbers of chromosomal structures in which their genes are stacked. Humans have 46 chromosomes per normal cells (23 pairs), but other animals vary from 2 to 200 struc- tures; b) When sperm and egg fuse in \"conception,\" identical structures, one from each parent, must find each other and pair up, in order that further development of the (now) fer- tilized embryo can proceed; c) Eu>en within the same species, embryos with odd numbers and unmatched chro- mosomes almost always fail to develop at all, and the few-that-do become early spontaneous abortions or are born with severe birth defects such as Downs Syndrome; d) Different species not only pack their genes into different numbers and differently shaped chromosome structures, but they have wildly different arrangements and cod- ings for genes, and have wildly differ- ing gross amounts of DNA (genetic molecules) per cell. Within a species the egg-sperm- embryo system is a beautifully coor- dinated chemical and geometric ballet, wherein the big structural molecules (proteins) and the big genetic mole- cules (DNA) mesh and meld together in exactly preordained ways. Oddball extras or missing actors foul the harmony, usually catastrophically. This is why you can't mate mice and humans (in the test-tube) despite their near identity of DNA and pro- teins (about 90 to 95%). Although our gene numbers are about the same (c. 300,000), our chromosome packaging systems are not (mice have 20 pairs, 40 chromosomes). Mice and men sex cells have been fused in the labora- tory, by the way. The resulting struc- tures are not compatible, fortunately, and these \"embryos\" behave tumor- ously for a while and do not develop. Thankfully we will never have to con- tend with someone or something who \"doesn't know if he's a man or a mouse.\" Note that despite a very great deal of genetic identity, the mouse-man hybrid doesn't even get started. What about gorillas or chimpanzees? Gorilla, chimp, and human DNA seems to be around 99% identical at our current best guess. (Estimates have risen from 97% to 98% and upward as we do more research). Not only that, but the gross structuring of the genes in chromosome stacks is 99% identical as well. We are very close to being reproductively compatible. But we are probably not (someone some- where probably knows the answer to this question, but that someone is not this author. In respectable scientific literature 1 have not been able to locate any reports of reproductive cell lab fusions of human and great ape cells, or of secondary evidence such as the existence of gorilla- chimpanzee hybrids in zoos or in the wild. I would bet money that some- one has tried the aforementioned cell fusions, but would not be surprised if the results were not published, given the social and psychological furor such experiments might elicit). Humans, as we've noted, stack their genes in 23 pairs of chromo- somes. Gorillas and chimps stack theirs in 24 pairs. A human sex cell would therefore have 23 chromo- somes, and a chimp sex cell 24. Upon fusion to form an \"embryo,\" 22 of the chromosomes are identical enough that they might try to pair up (although they will nof be precisely identical). The last human chromo- some would be very unlikely to pair with the two extra ape chromosomes, despite many similarities in the con- tained genes. The \"embryo,\" if viable at all, would probably not develop far. MUTUAL UFO Network Journal, Number 247, November 1988 An advanced genetic engineering tech- nology could doubtless overcome these these difficulties of man-ape hybridi- zation, given their 99% compatibility to begin with. No crude KingKong- FayWray hybridization experiment is likely though, even with two such evolutionarily related species. The famous \"wild cross-breeds\" (lion-tiger, horse-donkey, killer whale-dolphin, etc.) are all, as far as I know, products of two species even more closely related than we and our ape \"cousins\". ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY But couldn't \"advanced alien tech- nology\" overcome all this difficulty? Well, maybe yes and maybe no. The rest of this portion of the article will attempt to show why the answer may be no, and why, even if the answer is yes, the hybridization of sperm and egg in all likelihood makes no sense, at least in the usual \"extraterrestrial alien\" context. What is necessary to give even advanced technology a reasonable chance at hybridization? Well, for a start it would be nice if we were made out of the same chemicals. DNA is a rather complex piece of chemistry. It has a sugar-phosphate backbone — a specific sugar, deoxyr- ibose, perhaps one of hundreds of possible sugars; and it has a four \"code-word\" system of nitrogenous compounds — just four of a large number of possible \"cousin-compounds\" of the purine and pyrimidine classes. These four code-word molecules hang off the sugar-phosphate backbone and are \"read\" by protein structures to produce (as if by following a coded recipe) all the other proteins needed to make the organism. We, and all Earthian life, are geared toward this single code. Should we assume that all life forms \"out there\" will be based on the same, precisely the same, \"vocabulary\"? Maybe. Maybe not. It could be that \"our\" code words are not arbitrary but demanded by things such as chemical stability and proper \"force displays\" (mild attractive for- ces resident in chemical groups on the code-word molecules). It would be a bit of a surprise if our common- est code-word (Adenine) was not 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"employed by others elsewhere, for instance. But the fact that some vari- ability of code structure exists even among Earth forms gives one the intuition that extraterrestrial coding could be different. (I assume, by the way, that some form of DNA-like coding will exist, because all the cur- rent calculations show that such nucleic acid structures are the only likely stable chemicals forms, in aggre- gations with proteins). So, whether even our basic chem- istry is the same is up to rather severe questioning. But let's imagine that the coding is physically deter- mined by fundamental forces, and the ecologies of the galaxy are chemically kindred. We would still have to imagine a lot of other coincidences: the way that macromolecules are folded and aggregated, the way that codes are read and translated into spe- cific amino acid chains, the way that genes are turned on and off, the way that they are stored (chromosom- ally?), the specific order in which they are stored, the specific support struc- tures which \"unzip\" DNA helices, aid the code-copying, attach to chromo- some structures and \"haul away\" duplicates to form a new cell, etc. etc. etc. Some of these things could be determined, but many surely are not. The variations within even appar- ently closely related Earth forms show that vast variability is possible. Example, some plants have the same number of chromosomes per cell as cats, 38, but an apparently much closer organism, dogs, have 78 chromo- somes per cell. The moral of the story is this: an independently evolv- ing life-form (ET) must have extremely divergent subcellular chemical and structural characteristics, which would make hybridization either impossible (different fundamental codes or code- reading) or a huge molecular archi- tecture \"remodeling\" problem. I hope to shortly show that even the latter possibility dissolves into nonsense when we look at it. All this reasoning is based upon an independently evolved (non-related) species. We can reflect on other possibilities later. \"But they're so advanced, surely they can do anything they want to.\" Well fine, let's let them, and see 8 where that thinking leads us. A dis- turbing feature of human \"discus- sion,\" it often seems, is that we retreat into \"safe\" or pat-answer remarks without realizing that we need to continue to use our minds to explore the consequences or even the reasonableness of those remarks. So let's make the following large assumptions and keep thinking: • Assumption: all the chemical and subcellular structures of any aliens have independently evolved on similar bases, but the chromosome-packing (gene arrangements) and numbers are not identical; • Assumption: the aliens are mas- ter genetic engineers and molecular architects; they can do anything. • Now, comes the \"research pro- gram.\" Humans are abducted. Sperm and eggs are taken. Amazingly we both use the same sorts of cells and chemistry. Let's fuse the sex cells and see what happens. The aliens have no problem forcing the cells to fuse. But nothing (in a developmental sense) happens. The cells labor and die, or they throw off one half or the other of the chromosomes (this is what happens in our labs when two different species' sex cells are fused). Why? Well, ET knows immediately: different numbers of chromosomes. Easily fixed, just break up the chromo- somes and rejoin pieces to get the same number. No, not good enough, ET is not that dumb. They realize that the problem goes deeper. All the genes are stacked up differently (a known variation in all our Earth forms, species to species). They'll have to completely break down one or the other genomes (i.e. all the chromosomes into their separate genes) and rebuild a set of compatible chromosomes from scratch. Can they do it? Sure, assumption two gave them the power to do any- thing. But, the question arises, then why would they bother? This new question refers not to their ultimate motivation but merely to the issue of \"technique\", aimed at whatever their purpose was. To clarify: if they must break down the whole genome -and rebuild compatible structures (and have the skill to do so), then they do not need to harvest sperm or eggs to pursue any genetic experiments, includ- ing hybridization, which involve both species. In fact, sperm and eggs would be the stupidest cells to harv- est as they contain only half the genes. It would be far simpler and less traumatic to take simple surface somatic cells and use the genome they contain. In the simplest stated form: if ET is not an incredible molecular architect, it can't make the independently evolved sperm and egg genetically compatible; if ET is such an incredible molecular architect, it has many more sensible ways of pur- suing such experimental programs (or whatever they are). In fact, advanced ETs could eschew the big \"harvesting program\" altogether, as it is surely much easier for such technical wizards to make the proper structures \"off the shelf\" from raw components to put into their \"gene machines\". But what if they want a compatible cell to be placed in a human mother's womb for awhile, and it's a lot simpler to just take the egg since it's already made for the job? Well, for a start, that is an argument completely irrelevant for the taking of human sperm. As far as eggs are concerned, one main reason for using an egg would be that its surface was immu- nologically compatible with the moth- er's immune system. If \"they\" are worried about this, it means that their immune system \"marker or signal proteins\" are different than ours (an extremely likely situation). If that is true, then very soon the developing embryo will be expressing wildly dif- ferent immune markers and will be rejected even by the pregnant moth- er's suppressed immune system. If they thought of this already and re- engineered their alien protein markers, then they didn't need the egg for this incompatibility in the first place. Once again, if they're not adept enough, then they've got big problems; if they are, they don't need to go to the trouble. And why do they need the \"womb-time\" anyway? An artificial birthing tank is surely child's play for such a species (whose general appear- ance would lead one to suspect such an artificial birthing technology any- way, as I have written about elsewhere). This part of the discussion could MUTUAL UFO Network Journal"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"go on, but all you patient readers are probably bored already, and I apolog- ize. The bottom line on the inde- pendently evolved, advanced ET is this: messing around with eggs, sperm, and women's wombs for purposes of alien-human hybridization programs makes little or no sense even under the best assumptions. Rather such behavior would smack of somewhat retarded ET technicians employing techniques little if any in advance of our own. And such artisans wouldn't then have the skills to do the job imputed of them. OTHER SCENARIOS • Partial hybridization: We twen- tieth century humans are already per- forming much cross-species, partial hybridization employing recombinant DNA technology. We can put human genes into bacteria, or firefly genes into plants. We are on the verge of inserting artificial genes into humans (to replace faulty ones). Certainly the advanced aliens could do likewise. That much is evident. But it still makes a non-sequitur out of the sperm and egg routine. Such genetic insertion technology adds a few genes to the 300,000 gene complement of the normal cells, and hopes that the few new additions express them- selves, while the normal bulk-total genome keeps life, coordinated and ongoing. The cells need the whole coordinated genome ... not half of it ... not an egg or a sperm, but the whole normal cell. Once again our genetic wizards would use a normal cell and not a sex cell. If they were a little less wizardly they'd use the spermatogonium rather than the sperm, or the pre-egg follicle cell rather than the egg ... which would require a dif- ferent harvesting technique. If eggs, and especially if sperm, are really being used for something, then the idea of even partial hybridization of independently evolved species doesn't make any sense either. • Related species: What if we and the aliens are very close to, if not precisely, the same species? Yes, that \"solves\" the hybridization problem. Now one only has to ask how such a situation could be true. A few, prob- ably very few, possibilities can be imagined, none of which is trivial as far as I can see. a) Managed species. Could we be a \"seeded\" or \"upgraded engineered\" species as some \"ancient astronaut\" theorists such as Zechariah Sitchin proposed? Well, it's imaginable, but it's not as simple as some would like to think. If we are engineered or seeded to be just like the aliens, then the fact that we are also 99% just like the great apes must be explained. Well perhaps the aliens engineered them too. Fine. But it doesn't stop there. We're 95%, or so, like the rodents, 90+% like the cattle, etc. etc. etc. In fact the entire Earth ecology hangs together genetically and struc- turally, from bacteria to humans, and therefore certainly from the beginning of Earth-life, 3 l / 2 billion years ago, till today. The alien zookeepers must have seeded the Earth's pre-biotic oceans aeons ago, and. kept regularly managed development experiments going throughout evolutionary history to correctly order gene and chromo- some structures until we intelligent apes finally arrived, ready for the cross-breeding. An extremely patient project, but one which allows eggs- and-sperm hybridization if you wish. b) Time travelers. All the problems neatly vanish if the aliens are \"us\" afterall. If time travel is (will be?) pos- sible then our advanced genetically- adapted descendents with their neot- enous big heads and small bodies, and their artificial birthing technolo- gies could have decided that they've screwed up the genome of the race by too much uniformity and needed to come back to the \"original crude stock\" to revitalize the species. Some of our lost genes could be useful and hybridization would be a simple tech- nique for our descendents to keep most of their basic traits intact while adding some of ours. And they wouldn't have to be total molecular engineering geniuses to do it (just have learned some of the tricks necessary to alter rate-governing genes so as to produce their big-headed neotenous forms). But they would have had to learn how to time-travel, and that is a considerable problem, if not impossible. But, pretending uneasi- ly for the moment that our few cur- rent scientific hints-that-it-may-be-pos- sible rum out to be real, then one needs to assume that they would discover how to time-travel before they learn all the genetic techniques necessary to just engineer new genes off the shelf and insert them directly. Well, who can say, but my money would be on the discovery of gene technol- ogy before time-travel. c) A few odd scenarios, like \"no human-alien hybrids,\" but rather the aliens are hybridizing us with other species from our own planet (apes, Neanderthals gathered earlier, or what- ever), can be imagined, but they too violate the \"fundamentalist literal ver- sion\" of the abduction reports, which say that the eggs and sperms are for the aliens. The last of my concepts, and the one I believe most likely, is that there is no alien-human hybridization going on at all. This concept admits itself of several variations. A. The experiences happened gener- ally as reported, sperm and eggs were taken, genetic experiments on the human genome have been made, even human babies have been created; \"hybridization\" is a false impression deliberately inflicted on the witness(es) for unknown reasons; subsets of the variation, dropping out specifics (like real babies), are possible, of course, but they increase the number of deliberately false aspects inserted by the alien \"plan\"; B. The same as the above, except that the \"errors\" are errors of inter- pretation caused by the witnesses' own states of consciousness and/or inability to comprehend what was going on; this would include additions due to dream-states; C. The experiences happened vague- ly as reported with large portions of the details being an arranged set of false stimuli provided by the aliens, which however seemed true and con- crete and clearly memorable; D. The same as the above with lit- tle actually accurate in memory due to altered consciousness; and large aspects of the reports being filled in with dream-like visions, archetypical imagery, and fantasies; E. The experiences, as regards MUTUAL UFO Nrtwotfc Joarad, Nambn 247. November 19"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"extraterrestrial involvement, did not happen. The reports are based upon something else, perhaps internal to the witness and/or hypnotist, perhaps not. CONCLUSIONS Somewhere in the last list of five scenarios lies the best guess as to the sperm-egg-hybridization reports' true meaning, in my view. Upon hearing this sort of \"argument,\" many people interested in UFO abductions seem to get quite nervous, despite the fact that most of the list includes the real- ity of the abduction as part of the explanation. A few last thoughts on the \"nervousness\" and what it may say about us. Some parties interested in UFOs see the abduction research as the final answer to the UFO mystery. Perhaps it will turn out to be just that. But what if the \"hybridization\" thing turns out to be a false lead, extraterrestrial legerdemain? Then what else in the story a/so is false? Most, if not all, of the \"data\" could simply wash down the legerdemain drain. The reality of the abductions could stand, but their meaning could be as far away as ever, ever hidden behind a curtain controlled by an extrater- restrial puppeteer. I understand, I believe, the desire to get answers, to end years of frustration. I also write these thoughts as a necessary, I believe, warning about \"data,\" and conclusions upon \"data,\" which in no way seems under the researcher's control. If this is a parade, I apologize for the cold shower. Other people are, it appears, even more worried. \"Hybridization\" seems to represent to them a situation akin to the \"camel's nose\" in the tent. If hybridization goes down to nonsense, will this not be tantamount to allow- ing the \"nose\" of the \"Camel of unreality\" into the UFO tent? Will not then the whole camel come in and the whole business of abductions fall apart? It is the job of the researchers to decide this. They must very criti- cally analyze their data and evaluate what they know about each bit of the reports or patterns, and why. Is each and every bit equally valid? If so, then the Camel's Nose scenario is indeed very possible. If some bits are far solider than \"hybridization,\" then the \"Nose stops there.\" Dear folks and colleagues, let us not (if you pardon the pun) get car- ried away on abductions. If you are convinced of the general reality, at least defer belief on specific details. Jumping to conclusions may leave you stranded in mid-air waiting for a nasty fall. It's a fall that I don't want any of us to take, nor can the field of study easily survive it. Steven Spiel- berg said \"Watch the Skies\". I say yes. But my West Virginian mentor, Mountain William, said \"If your head is always in the air, you may step in something on the road.\" And I say yes again.

Dr. Persinger is a clinical neuro- psychologist and Full Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Laurentian University, Sudbury, On- tario. His laboratory work is con- cerned primarily with the effects of geophysical and geochemical factors upon brain function. As mentioned in Hilary Evans' Visions, Apparitions and Alien Visi- tors, the visitor experience has been reported in various forms for centur- ies. The experience is associated with the conviction that personal contact has been made with an \"other dimen- sional\" entity or a consciousness. Often the experience appears to have 10 profound religious or cosmic signifi- cance. The visitor experience is a more intense form of the \"sense of a pres- ence.\" It is a frequent phenomenon reported by normal people. Approxi- mately 30% of 500 normal adults who have been assessed in the Neuros- cience Laboratory over the last 15 years have reported the experience. It is associated with the intense sense of the presence of an entity or a uni- versal consciousness, most frequently in the early morning hours. If the person is asleep, he or she will sud- denly awake, often with some degree of immobility or fear. We have strong, although inferen- tial, evidence that visitor experiences are associated with special kinds of electrochemical activity within the deep structures of the temporal lobes of the human brain. These portions of the brain are associated with the experience of meaningfulness, the sense of self and its relationship to space-time (which invariably evokes religious or cosmic'associations), mem- ory storage and retrieval, dreams, experiences of movements (like spin- ning or floating), smell, fear and images of internal organs. TEMPORAL LOBE FUNCTIONS One of the most important func- MUTUAL UFO Network Journal, Number 247, November 1988"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"tions of the temporal lobes is the processing of visual information. The left temporal lobe in most people is concerned with the naming of visual objects. On the other hand, the right temporal lobe is constructed to assess the perception and to store the memory of spatial shapes (such as triangles, complex visual forms) that are not easily described by words. Neuroscientists, the people who study the intricate relationship be- tween brain and behavior, have realiz- ed that a person's specific behaviors at any given time are determined by the part of the brain that is utilizing the most relative energy. If a person's left frontal lobe is very active com- pared to the rest of the brain, the behaviors associated with the frontal lobe will dominate the behavior. Be- cause that part of the brain is involved with structuring and organi- zation of behavior, the person may engage in ritualistic responses. Other people might perceive the person as \"obsessive\" or \"compulsive.\" This concept has important appli- cation to the visitor experience. If vis- itor experiences are produced by special kinds of electrochemical activ- ity in the temporal lobes, then the features of visitor experiences should be dominated by the characteristics of temporal lobe function. Conse- quently there should be (and are) ref- erences to a sense of presence, expe- riences of spinning, floating or vibra- .. tions, dream-like sequences, vague sensations of the genital or anal sphincter regions, and fear (or irrita- bility). Because an important part of the temporal lobe receives visual information from the edges of the visual fields, flickering sensations can occur in the the peripheral vision. Most importantly, the experiences are perceived as profound and as real. This is because two important structures of the temporal lobes, called the amygdala and the hippo- campus, are very important compo- nents of the visitor experience. When the amygdala is stimulated the person feels a sense of deep meaning and personal reality, even with the accom- panying feelings of strangeness of deja vu. When the hippocampus is affected, memory can be changed forever. Polygraph (lie detector) mea- surements will not facilitate detection of \"what really happened\" because to the person the memories are real. When both the hippocampus and amygdala are stimulated to produce the visitor experience, the person's sense of self can be changed per- manently. If the experience is very aversive or negative (associated with pain or disintegration of the person's world view), the symptoms may resem- ble post-traumatic stress. The expe- rient may report recurrences of \"the dream,\" show emotional stability and become hypervigilant. As a result he may over-respond to any small deviation from the routine and show sensitivity to noise. In more extreme conditions, there is a kind of restructuring of thought processes, much like a religious con- version. The person's behavior is modified. He or she feels differently and is perceived by others as differ- ent. The experient begins to interpret odd events as being meaningful or as special, personal messages from the perceived source of the experience (such as gods, other dimensional beings or extraterrestrials). A sense of destiny develops (\"the chosen one\") and invariably there is a desire to share the message (usually about the future of Man) with other people. Similar behaviors are displayed by people with clinically verified electrical and structural changes in the tem- poral lobes. NORMAL PEOPLE AND VISITOR EXPERIENCE Normal people who report UFO visitor experiences show strong signs of temporal lobe lability or sensitivity. They report \"smells of childhood just before they have fallen,\" while laying down they experience \"vibrations like driving over a rolling road\". When they have a tough decision to make they often experience a \"sign\" and know what to do. The electroence- phalographic (EEG) or \"brain wave\" patterns of these people do not show any evidence of temporal lobe or lim- bic epilepsy. This is not surprising because the typical EEG only mea- sures the electrical activity of the MUTUAL UFO Network Journal, Number 247, November 1988 outer layer or cortex of the brain. However there is a strong correlation between alpha activity over the tem- poral lobes and temporal lobe experien- ces. Under certain conditions, such as late at night, small spikes appear in the electroencephalographic measure- ments taken over the temporal lobes of very sensitive people such as wri- ters and poets. These apparently normal spikes are frequently related to activity deep within the temporal lobes, especially the amygdala. They are similar to the spike activity that everyone experiences every night dur- ing normal dreaming. Poets and wri- ters, or people with similar personali- ties, have more intrusion of this dream process into the normal wak- ing state, a factor that contributes to their creativity. People who report visitor experien- ces also have particular personalities. On the positive side, they are crea- tive, intuitive and interested in philo- sophical and aesthetic topics; many of them enjoy recording their thoughts or writing poetry. People with tem- poral lobe sensitivity are prone to bouts of \"hyperactivity\" during which time they are very productive. On the negative side, they show marked per- formance anxiety, emotional lability, tension and excessive rumination (overthinking). During personal stress, they are more prone to suspicious- ness, delusions, stereotyped thinking, intrusive thoughts (\"forced thinking\") and panic. Perhaps the strongest characteris- tic about people who report the vis- itor experience is their hypnotic sug- gestibility. People who report visitor experiences are usually excellent hyp- notic subjects and report vivid images, particularly for childhood events. They disassociate quickly, a process that is enhanced by their emotional lability and fragile ego-integration. People with these characteristics tend to enter vocations such as music, writing and acting. Within the physical sciences, \"temporal lobe sen- sitive\" people are found within more abstract areas, such as theoretical physics and mathematics, where meta- phorical thinking is encouraged. Often these people tend to be left-handed. 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"FACILITATING LIFE EVENTS Several factors appear essential for the occurrence of the type of visitor experience associated with UFO phe- nomena. Almost always there is a learning history that facilitated the translation (and \"forgetting\") of con- flicting or aversive memories into a right temporal lobe format. Because this side of the brain has relatively poor language capacity, the experien- ces are only vaguely acknowledged as feelings or tip-of-tongue experiences; they may be activated (and hence produce anxiety) when certain spatial or temporal patterns are experienced. These patterns may include arrange- ments of objects (scenery), sequen- ces of flashing lights or the specific demeanor of people. Two common processes facilitate \"coding\" of experiences into the non- verbal, emotional format of right temporal lobe function. One is strict early religious training that encour- ages contradictory behaviors (for exam- ple Catholicism). The other is a serious traumatic event, such as sex- ual abuse, that produces thought fragmentation and repression of memo- ries. When repressed images and memo- ries reach a sufficient \"critical number\" they acquire many of the characteris- tics of consciousness. These \"memo- ries, fantasies and perceptions\" from different developmental stages of think- ing fuse together into a complex unconscious fabric, the logic for which we are just beginning to understand. The person may feel as if \"something is wrong,\" but they can't articulate it. Often there is a history of \"time loss.\" In more routine clinical set- tings, individuals with similar back- grounds present as multiple personali- ties. Because the right hemisphere has a wider range of operation during bor- derline states of arousal than the left hemisphere of the brain, the details that compose the visitor experience will be derived primarily from repressed memories and from information acquir- ed by passive learning during twilight stages, such as before falling asleep, brief waking periods at night or when the person was \"not concentrating\" 12 during the day. Passive learning does not involve \"active concentration.\" For example, you might begin to anticipate the sequence of songs on a tape, even though you never \"con- centrated\" on the task. There is also evidence that we may normally acquire nonconventional information, such as that which may be involved with psi (telepathic) experiences, during these twilight states. Access to this information requires simultaneous activation of the left hemisphere function during simulated twilight states. This can occur spon- taneously during periods of disrupted sleep and awakening shortly after dreams. Hypnosis is particularly effec- tive. This clinically powerful technique can release the suppressed, highly emotional images from fantasy and past experiences into consciousness where they can be acknowledged. This \"autoarticulation\" or learning to label right hemispheric images with left hemispheric words is an impor- tant process of many psychological therapies. However, there is convincing data that hypnosis can generate certain components of the UFO experience. Clinicians who use hypnosis daily realize that the subject in the hyp- notic condition is often equivalent lin- guistically to a five or six year old child, primarily due to the language limit of right hemispheric function. Some phenomenon, such as the experience of \"time loss,\" may be an artifact of the hypnotic treatment. In other words, the process of hypnosis itself encourages the experiences of \"missing time\". One method of hypnosis, the so- called regression technique, allows the simultaneous experience of the myriad of strange, unrelated expe- riences that have been stored over a lifetime. Images that have existed as unrelated or illogical sequences, can become structured into one meaning- ful theme during a single session. Integration into a logical sequence occurs because the person is awake and is utilizing the prominent func- tions of the left hemisphere: logical sequential thinking. The reorganiza- tion can result in very powerful cogni- tive restructuring. Consequently the person perceives his past and expe- riences his future very differently than before the intervention. TRIGGERING VISITOR EXPERIENCES Given temporal lobe lability and its associated personality characteristics, the visitor experience is very likely during periods of psychological depres- sion or personal crisis (changes in life, loss of loved one). More and more frequently people with the per- sonal characteristics noted earlier are reporting UFO visitor-like experien- ces during stress. When a woman who has personal problems walks into a parking lot and perceives a space craft over her car in the middle of a major city and then develops a sense of purpose and dedication, the separation between UFO and religious visitors becomes very thin. The non-clinician may not realize that visitor experiences are relatively frequent. For example, one case with which I was involved concerned a middle-aged woman who complained of \"nightly visitors.\" She first only felt their presence but later sensed that they were small humanoids that flick- ered around her bed and often car- ried her away. They appeared obsessed with her sexual organs. Later she developed warts on both her left hand and her genitals. When given psychological assess- ments, she presented as a normal middle-aged woman. The only pecu- larity was a mild elevation on a scale that measures bouts of hyperactivity (hypomania). She had been sexually abused as a child and had taken cocaine on several occasions about six months before the onset of the experiences. The nightly visitors dis- appeared when she was treated with a medication that is known to dampen both excessive amygdaloid activity and hypomania. The UFO visitor experience appears to have the added factor of the occurrence of luminous displays within the immediate environment and the specific reference to alien intelligen- ces. Dr. John S. Derr and I have been testing the theory that, most anomalous luminous phenomena are- MUTUAL UFO Network Jound, Number 247, Novemb«r 1989"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"associated with intense electromagnetic- like fields generated by tectonic strain within the earth's crust. Much evi- dence has been accumulated in sup- port of the existence of these fields, at least at spatial perspectives that involve regional seismicity. Although the hypothesized tectonic strain fields may generate many of the luminous displays that are labelled as verified UFO reports, these fields could also occur in less intense forms (without major luminous displays) within people's houses. In one case study by Dr. Bob Cameron (Profes- sor of Geology) and myself, what may have been indicators of these fields were recorded during a low- level haunt (another variant of the vis- itor experience) episode during the only major UFO flap in Sudbury. These \"transients\" were recorded inside of an apartment and lasted for several seconds each. The strip chart records of these fields displayed evi- dence of intense magnetic compo- nents. (Interestingly, UFO themes have become more evident in many contemporary haunt episodes.) At present the most consistent dif- ference between visitor experiences generated by psychological vs. exter- nal forces is the appearance of symp- toms similar to post-traumatic stress shortly after the first encounter. Typ- ical symptoms include depression, hypervigilance, recurrent dreams, con- centration problems and emotional disorders. Although these symptoms in conjunction with skin lesions are not conclusive of a physical agent, they are strong indicators. There is now evidence that brief exposures to brain frequency electromagnetic fields affect suggestibility and temporal lobe function; chronic exposure can lead to psychological depression and phys- ical disorders. POSSIBLE BRAIN MECHANISMS The electromagnetic stimuli that could produce a UFO visitor expe- rience might only be present for a few seconds. The hippocampus, that portion of the temporal lobe that is considered the gateway to memory, can be activated for hours after only a few seconds of focal stimulation by weak 100 Hz to 400 Hz electrical cur- rents. It is also now known that brief, electrical seizure activity can influ- ence activity of the genes in brain cells that influence their DNA. Once the DNA sequence is changed the proteins that store memory are altered. The modified memory would appear as real as memory acquired under more normal conditions. Because mem- ory is the \"measuring stick\" by which experience is referenced, the change will never be recognized. Other peo- ple, however, may observe changes in the person. The amygdala, that part of the brain associated with the sense of self and meaningfulness, is particularly prone to electrical activity. During dreaming, the normal process by which the day's experiences are trans- lated into memory, the amygdala shows small seizure-like activity that can be recorded with only special electrodes. The amygdala can \"learn\" to display seizure-like activity by repeated stimulations of brief electri- cal currents (a few seconds) pres- ented as infrequently as once every few days; the process is called kindling. If a type of kindling mechanism is involved with the occurrence of vis- itor experiences, then psychological stress would increase the duration and variability of detail associated with the experience. Neurophysiolog- ical studies have shown that small seizure-like electrical activity deep in the amygdala requires the presence of the body's most powerful stress chemical, adrenocorticotrophic hor- mone (ACTH). This suggests that when people are \"stressed out\" the visitor experience should be more evident and the perceptions of it should be more lucid. COMMUNION CONNECTION The basic pattern of the first occurrence and development of Whi- tley Strieber's visitor experience as described in Communion is remarka- bly similar to the classic visitor expe- rience. In addition, three stages: 1) the altered state generated by the anomalous experience, 2) the depres- sion and psychological disintegration and 3) the solution and self reintegra- MUTUAL UFO Network Journal. Number 247, November 1988 tion, are hallmarks of the conversion phenomenon. The role of the tem- poral lobe factor in the triggering of the experience is noted by the frequent references to the sense of presence (of the creatures), their first occur- rence in the peripheral visual field, the sense of strangeness, the genital and anal sphincter sensations, odd smells and the fear of ego disintegration. The post-experiential stages of en- hanced communion following hypno- sis, cognitive restructuring (under- standing odd events from the past in an integrated manner), the feeling that he was chosen, the reception of a message for Man and the compul- sion to spread the word are classic sequences found in variants of both religious and secular conversions. Strieber's ability to recall vivid imagery from childhood, especially analogues of imaginary playmates, and suggestibility indicate his propen- sity for temporal lobe signs. Indeed his profession (a gifted and creative, left-handed writer), performance anx- iety and life-long tension are indica- tive of the appropriate personality factor. His stated history of strict religious upbringing would predispose him to translating (suppressing) con- flicting experiences into right tem- poral lobe formats. What is not clear, outside of his own description of psy- chological depression and existential anxiety before the first major expe- rience, is the stimulus that triggered the phenomena. ETHICAL CHALLENGES Although Strieber's case has gener- ated substantial media coverage, his experience creates an even greater dilemma for professionals who work in psychiatry and psychology. The clinician, such as Dr. Donald Klein, is ethically and humanely obligated to reducing the anxiety and distress of the patient. From a strict clinical perspective, the validity of memories retrieved by hypnosis are irrelevant as long as the person can be inte- grated. Dr. Klein performed precisely as a competent professional in the mental health field should. On the other hand, the scientist, such as Dr. Michael Swords, or the 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"skeptic, like Philip Klass, is obliged to determine the validity of the expe- rience or to at least entertain alterna- tive explanations. From the relatively objective perspective of scientific inquiry, the importance of Whitley Strieber, the man tormented by self-eroding thoughts, is not as critical. If the scientist is correct and the commun- ion was a modern version of an incu- bus nightmare, then Mr. Strieber's solution is impugned and his personal stability is threatened. Destruction of a person's world view can be as deadly psychological and medically as any physical agent. The solution is not a simple one. ALTERNATIVE RESEARCH STRATEGIES The implication of temporal lobe factors in visitor experiences has important research implications. First, the experience will be considered real by the experient. Attempts at debunk- ing the experience will not only be futile but may verge on ethical viola- tions if the experience has been a psychological solution to personal problems. Secondly, the use of regres- sion hypnosis as the means of extract- ing \"repressed\" information is a par- ticularly precarious method that may be generating much of the \"memory\" of the UFO experience, especially if more information is revealed with each hypnotic session. In pursuit of \"finding the truth\" about the- UFO visitor experience, well-intentioned amateurs often use repeated regression hypnosis. It can in some instances produce more per- sonal trauma than the factors that precipitated the experience. The most obvious alternative is that only regis- tered professional psychologists or psychiatrists should control the direc- tion and strategies for cognitive inter- ventions of people who report panic- producing UFO visitor experiences. The mechanism behind the visitor experience could still be (more safely) pursued by using two modern tech- niques from cognitive neuroscience. The first procedure is to abandon regression hypnosis in favor of the objective assessment of the person's cognitive organization. By using the 14 paradigm of cognitive psychologists, the researcher can infer the deep semantic (language) processes of the experient by evaluating his or her rel- ative response latencies to key words that are presented for specific dura- tions by computer. Different semantic processes appear to involve different regions and functional states of the brain. Words with similar emotional or semantic loadings show similar re- sponse profiles. Thus if there has been a traumatic experience with an altered state of consciousness, spe- cific words such as \"alien,\" \"space ship,\" \"operating table\" and \"large eyes\" should require different response times compared to other less specific terms. Because the neural structures for semantic processing can be access- ed even without volition or awareness on the part of the participant, alleged \"repressed\" information can be deter- mined without contaminating it by direct interrogation (a frequent diffi- culty with regression hypnosis). The essential equipment, a per- sonal computer, is simple. The under- standing of linguistic processing is a bit more difficult. However, the use of this technology would place the study of UFO abductee or visitor experien- ces within the realm of contemporary cognitive sciences. Once these methods are applied, the isolation of the mechanism by which the experiences occur will follow. The second procedure is to aban- don the intricate arguments about whether or not the experience \"really\" occurred. Instead, emphasis should be placed on accurate assessment of the experient's neuropsychological and personality profile in conjunction with the details of the experience. With the exception of the work by Dr. Leo Sprinkle and some recent case stu- dies, most researchers have focused on problems of verifying the expe- rience more than on understanding the client. If the neural mechanisms discussed in this paper are valid, then the issue of \"did the experience occur or not as it was stated\" may be unanswerable if brain mechanisms are directly affected. Ultimately it will be the phenome- nology of the experiences and how they reflect the operations of the specific brain areas that produce them that will illuminate the source of the visitor phenomena. Within the last century, visitor experiences have progressively altered from angels to other dimensional creatures. Their occurrence has not changed. Often the \"messages\" are reflective of sub- stantial insight and extraordinary creati- vity. Even from this perspective, the pursuit of the neural mechanism is a worthwhile endeavor. In the final analysis, if something is really true then no amount of challenge will ever change it. Note This article is a non-technical pres- entation.

Downing The publication of Whitley Strieb- er's Transformation: The Breakthrough, will probably leave many MUFON members preferring Shirley MacLaine. But like it or not, Strieber will be set- ting the pace for UFO discussion for some time to come. He has the time to go on the road, and his intelligence enables him to make the unbelievable sound possible. UFO proponents of the Extrater- restrial Hypothesis (ETH), the Psy- chological Hypothesis (PH), and the God Hypothesis (GH), will all find material to support their pet theory in this latest book. Strieber's insistence on the physical nature of his encoun- ters (including the nine knocks on the side of his house in the night, in three groups of three), will be pleasing to the nuts and bolts (ETH) advocates. His constant seeking of reassu- rance of his own sanity, his interest in mythology, his praise for Jacques Val- lee's work, especially Passport to Magonia, will give aid and comfort to the psychological (PH) advocates. But the bulk of the new material in this book, especially the revelations and visions he receives from the Vis- itors, is clearly religious in nature, which gives me encouragement in my pursuit of the GH. One has to begin with the prelimi- nary question: Is this either a hoax, or is Strieber emotionally unstable? I don't think this is a hoax — his wife has to be in on it, along with several others, if it is. What about emotional stability? I attended the 1987 MUFON Interna- tional UFO Symposium in Washing- ton, DC, and watched Strieber's pub- lic confrontation with Philip J. Klass. It was an emotional scene, and Strieber was clearly very tense. He talks constantly about fear in both Communion and Trans/ormafion, and fear plays an important role in his fic- tion. The psychological issue has a right to a serious hearing, but that is not my field. As Mt. Sinai was wrapped in smoke, as we now only \"see through a glass darkly/' it is the nature of the divine to stay essentially hidden. I have talked about \"faith\" in my other UFO writings, and as a matter of \"faith\" I am operating under the assumption that Strieber is telling us the truth to the best of his ability about what has happened to him. \"Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom\" (Proverbs 9:10), and fear is a constant note in human and divine encounter in the Bible. It was also clearly part of the Betty Andreasson experience — which is, I believe, a sign of the authenticity of the expe- rience, not of paranoia. If I am right about the GH, then I would not expect that we can ever scientifically authenticate the reality of either the Andreasson or Strieber revelations. As Mt. Sinai was wrapped in smoke, as we now only \"see through a glass darkly,\" it is the nature of the divine to stay essentially hid- den. The God of the Bible often gives humans room for \"plausible deniabil- ity.\" That is, if humans don't want to believe in God, they don't have to. For instance, the Gospel of Matthew reports that when Jesus was raised from the dead, the tomb guards were paid to spread the story that the dis- ciples stole the body of Jesus, cer- tainly a more \"plausible\" story than the one that he was raised from death. Modern UFO debunkers also understand the power of plausibility. Our space age mentality gives God the option of revealing himself to us, while we dismiss that reality as \"only\" space beings from another world. Or we can call modern UFOs some kind of religious myth created by the MUTUAL UFO Network Journal, Number 247, November 1988 human mind. Thus if I am right about the GH, then the ETH and the PH are being used by God to keep athe- ism as a live option, making faith in the GH remain a real, but not com- pelling choice. This disguise leads to what Vallee calls \"metalogic.\" But at the same time, the GH is now alive in a new way. Even reli- gious leaders, under the influence of scientific skepticism, have stopped believing that \"angels can come down from the sky.\" The idea that the God of Jews and Christians is a being who revealed himself to chosen people had all but been forgotten — so for- gotten in fact, that no major religious leaders to this day understand what has happened in front of their eyes (Note: Religious leaders don't think of me as a religious leader). Andreasson and Strieber are now the two main abductees who seem to fit the overall abduction pattern out- lined by Budd Hopkins, and who have been through multiple abduc- tions which have clear religious content. Andreasson and Strieber went through what seemed to be the classic \"phys- ical\" exam in the presence of UFO beings, but then went on to what Thomas E. Bullard calls a \"theo- phany.\" The religious background of Andreasson is that of a devout con- servative Protestant female. Strieber was brought up as a liberal, not-too- devout Roman Catholic male. It is good to see that the UFO reality is ecumenical, works both sides of the political spectrum, and is sexually inclusive. Strieber believes the phe- nomenon works in sets of three, so the next American religious abductee should be black and Jewish (Sammy Davis, Jr., beware). I want to make a few comments about the religious dimensions of the Strieber experience. He was afraid that someday the \"Visitors\" would abduct his son Andrew. Not only was this fear realized, but the UFO reality awakened Strieber so that he would 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"know his son was gone. Strieber checked his son's bed, went outside, saw a dark UFO in the sky, then went back into the house and back to bed. In the morning Andrew was safe. Strieber tells this as a story of his own fear. But in light of the religious imagery that comes later in the book, we have to see this as a classical story of a father sacrificing his son to a Higher Cause. In the Old Testa- ment, it is the story of Abraham sacrificing his son Isaac (Genesis 22). In the New Testament it is the agony of God offering his Son on the Cross. In spite of his Catholic background, Strieber does not refer to these archetypal religious stories. Strieber is confused and troubled by a dream or vision in which he sees rocks falling from the moon to the earth — the moon has exploded. He wonders if we are heading toward an apocalypse — and this must be con- sidered a possibility. The New Tes- tament image of the \"end times\" is described as follows: \"But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken\" (Mark 13:24). But I think it more likely that the moon in his dream refers to his mother. In the Old Testament story of Joseph, in a dream Joseph symbol- izes his mother as the moon, and his father as the sun (Genesis 37:9). The breaking up of the moon, and fall to earth (to be buried), would then refer to the coming death of his mother. Later in his book, he makes a traumatic \"life and death\" trip to see his aging mother, and confronts not only her death, but his own. Strieber goes through his own ver- sion of temptation and fall, being ordered not to eat chocolate (forbid- den fruit) by the Visitors, then doing so. In one encounter Strieber is shown a naked man beaten for his own sins, echoing the Suffering Ser- vant theme of Isaiah, \"he was wounded for our transgression ... and with his stripes we are healed\" (Isaiah 53:5). In one journey with the Visitors he sees drawers full of bodies, and con- 16 eludes much of the aim of the Vis- itors is to get him over his fear of death because there is life beyond death. The book is full of religious symbol- ism, more than I can deal with here. I mention the issues of the abduction of his son, and the moon dream, to illustrate that I do not believe Strieber is adequately prepared to interpret the revelations he is receiving. In one interesting story at the end of his book, Strieber relates how his pub- lisher, Bruce Lee, saw two people in a store about to buy Communion, then went over to discuss it with them only to overhear them say, \"Oh, he's got that wrong!\" The beings were short, and mysteriously dressed. Lee confronted them, then left in fear. Strieber observes that the beings both confirmed and denied his revelation experience. My inclination in dealing with Strie- ber is to trust most of the events he describes, but I am sometimes doubt- ful of how he interprets the events. Strieber thinks that the purpose of his UFO experience is to start all of us on the road to \"a real relationship\" (p. 237). By that he means he thinks we humans should soon expect to relate to the Visitors almost as we relate to each other. I don't think that is the correct interpretation. I believe the purpose of the UFO phenomenon is to let us know that somebody up there is still watching us — God is not dead. We have a purpose, and a destiny beyond this world, but we have in this life to walk by faith, not by sight. I think the Andreasson and Strieber experience are mainly to show us how revelation has occurred in the past. But I do not think that either the Strieber or Andreasson experience adds much new to our historical religious know- ledge. In his forward to Vallee's Dimen- sions, Strieber worries that the UFO phenomenon will bring about a \"new religion of remarkable scope.\" I do not see a new religion in the revela- tions of either Strieber or Andreas- son. I see the old religion in a new disguise — a space age disguise. If I am right about the God Hypothesis, what is coming next? There are two possibilities: 1) the big bang ending, or 2) recovery and reform. Christianity keeps both these pos- sibilities open. Jesus teaches that we have to be ready for \"the end\" at any time. But it has been two thousand years, and the end is not yet. It seems to me that the earth best serves God's purpose when it is a \"faith school,\" which is essentially one of Strieber's revelations about the purpose of life. If the end comes, then school is out. I believe our time is very much like an Old Testament time when the Jewish religion had gone down hill badly. It was during the reign of King Josiah, and a priest discovered the lost book of the Jewish Law (2 Chronicles 34). When it was read, great religious reforms took place. In our time, religious belief has been buried by scientific skepticism. God's \"faith game\" has been doing badly for almost a century. With considerable risk for overstat- ing Strieber's importance in history, Strieber reminds me of the Apostle Paul and Martin Luther. Paul and Strieber were both converted out in the country (Paul on the Damascus Road, Strieber in upstate New York). Paul was a leader of the main intellec- tual force of his day, Pharisaical Juda- ism. Strieber as an author was a leader in the main intellectual force of our day, a force that explains all of life in terms of physics and psychol- ogy (the source of the two main schools of UFO theory, the ETH and the PH). Martin Luther was an Augustinian Monk in the Roman Catholic Church, and was converted by a new concept of \"faith\" which he discovered in Paul's letter to the Romans. The Roman Catholic Church excommuni- cated him for this discovery. Strieber is not being converted away from his Roman Catholic Church— if anything, he is being converted back to it. His main religion has been American scientific intellectualism; now he is an Apostle who says there is more to the cosmos than Carl Sagan knows. There is a Higher Reality out there, the reality of the Visitors.

In a recent MUFON Journal article (1) I suggested separating \"contact\" and \"abduction\" reports into six separate \"groupings\" of witnesses. \"Group Six\" described a class of witnesses who apparently have been successful in warding off so-called \"bedroom vis- itors\" by means of various tech- niques. There are several cases of this kind in my personal files which suggest the possibility that human beings are not helpless against intru- sions by the UFO Phenomenon. Three general techniques for break- ing unwanted contact have emerged. In view of a general feeling in the research field that the human race is powerless against abduction by UFO entities, any information which points to a contrary conclusion should be made available to any and all who can accept the possibility and/or con- firm it. One case of this kind concerns Emily Cronin, whose UFO experien- ces are set forth in the book, Tujunga Canyon Contacts, co-authored by myself and D. Scott Rogo (2). Her encounters with \"bedroom visitor\" type entities began in 1956, following a UFO encounter on the Ridge Route, a winding mountainous road in Central California, an experience which she shared with Jan Whitley, another of the Tujunga Canyon wit- nesses (3). Shortly after this expe- rience, the nighttime visits began and continued with some regularity for several years. During the bedroom visitations, Emily was awakened from sleep by a piercing, whining noise (4). This was accompanied by a generalized feeling of paralysis and the visual sighting of large-headed creatures with huge slant- ed eyes. She did not see much of these entities except the heads and a suggestion of shoulders. Whether this was due to the fact that she seemed forced to stare into the hypnotic eyes of these \"visitors\" or whether the head and shoulders were, in fact, all that manifested, has not been determin- ed. Invariably, the entities communi- cated telepathically with Emily, entreat- ing her to \"go with them.\" To the best of her knowledge, she was always successful in telling them \"no\" and consequently does not recall being abducted. Emily's technique for warding off the unwanted contact with \"bedroom visitor\" entities was simply sustained mental effort, directed toward \"breaking\" the paralysis. 1 Start- ing with the very first contact, she learned that if she could manage to move even one toe or finger, the paralysis would end. At the same time, the irritating, high-pitched tone and apparitions abruptly disappeared. From her experience at fhe Ridge Route, she suspected that, in the event another person is sharing in a \"bedroom visitor\" experience to the point of also being paralyzed (as Jan also was on the Ridge Route) that their paralysis also abruptly ends. In regard to paralytic/creature epi- sodes in general, some natural occur- rences recognized by psychology might possibly explain some reports of the \"bedroom visitor\" type. There is a phenomenon which affects some people, and which occurs in certain sleep MUTUAL UFO Network Journal, Number 247, November 1988 stages, called catalepsy, during which vivid mental imagery is experienced. Then there is a more common type of sleep paralysis in which some of the normal stages leading to REM (dream state) are somehow bypassed, resulting in persons feeling paralyzed without really being deeply asleep. As a consequence, they can be con- sciously aware of feeling paralyzed.- This is often accompanied by hypnago- gic-like imagery. Hypnagogic images are flashing visual effects; usually they are images of faces and disembodied heads passing rapidly one after another before the mind's eye. They are never accompanied by sounds or speech. In another common sleep disorder, the large muscles relax but the peripheral muscles of the feet and hands become active and may twitch. In other words, the body is asleep before consciousness is lost; in this stage, hypnagogic imagery is com- mon. OBE's Emily has reported experiences with some forms of sleep paralysis. She states that she often travels astrally during sleep and can always tell when an out-of-body experience has occurred. On those occasions she wakes up very gradually, as her astral form merges again with the physical form. Some paralysis of her body occurs while the awakening process is going on at the end of an QBE. Her other episodes of sleep paraly- sis were always entirely different from the episodes with the \"faces,\" how- ever. The other times she has felt 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"\"paralyzed,\" she did not hear the high-pitched sound or see the \"enti- ties.\" Since hypnagogic (and hypno- pompic) imagery involves perception of flashing, momentary images and generally does not have sound/ speech associated with it, it seems probable that sleep states which involve paralysis and visual images are apart and separate from the \"bedroom visitor\" type of UFO encount- er. In regard to the technique Emily developed to ward off the insistent visitors with their huge, slanted eyes, it is important to stress here that she has a strong sense of herself as a Person with rights. She felt at the time of the episodes that she had the right to say \"yes\" or \"no\" to their demands. It was apparently this con- fidence that enabled her to say \"no\" in spite of the entities' repeated, forceful entreaties to \"go with them.\" Emily has never felt that the bed- room visitors were inimical in any way, but were merely other types of intelligent life — extraterrestrial, intra- dimensional or otherwise, she did not know. She feels that their motive in contacting human beings was simple curiosity, and, in spite of her initial fright, accepts them as part of the Unity of Life. The second case of a witness who apparently was able to ward off unwanted contact by UFO beings is Lori Briggs, whose 1975 experience is also described in Tujunga Canyon Contacts (5). The witness, who con- sciously retained some memories (the rest being hypnotically-recalled) was reportedly contacted by small, large- headed entities in her bedroom, wrap- ped in light, and transported through her apartment wall to an apparent \"craft,\" where she was examined by means of an X-ray type apparatus which involved \"slabs\" and beams of light. When the creatures asked Lori to \"go with them\" (for breeding pur- poses, she felt) she decided she did not want to do so. She broke contact with the creatures by \"making her own sound\" silently within herself, and successfully found herself trans- ported back to her bed. Lori states that she has always been able to \"make her own sound\" 18 instinctively, from early childhood. The sound is not a mantra or any type of learned meditative technique. At the time of her encounter, she had not studied metaphysics or any med- itative techniques and still doesn't know too much about the subject. In fact, she was not amenable to being termed \"metaphysical\" until a defini- tion of the term as \"being aware of the unity of Being,\" the term \"Being\" including a \"Creator,\" was shared with her. Lori agreed with these tenets. She describes \"her own sound\" basically as a tone, somewhat similar to a musical note, which reverberates in the upper part of her body — in the head, shoulders and chest. It is similar to a vibration but also is a real sound heard inside her head. She uses it to relax or in times of stress when she is called upon to solve par- ticular problems. Emily Cronin is also familiar with the concept of a person's \"own sound,\" describing it as originating in a person's back, in a broad band just below the shoulder region. She advises that concentrating on this area will produce a person's own sound, but that for most persons, mastering the technique takes considerable prac- tice. Emily also suggests that a per- son can \"draw the sound up\" through the head and out the crown chakra. The question here, as in all \"abduc- tee cases,\" is whether the creatures perceived were intelligent entities sepa- rate from the witnesses' own mind. In my considered opinion, it is reasona- ble to assume, at least in the most convincing cases, they were. The creatures might have realized that they were dealing with a witness who was \"centered,\" who knew herself as a Person with inviolable rights, and who was confident in her Self. In Lori's case, this attitude and self- confidence prevented her from expe- riencing lasting trauma and negative emotions, as far as her \"abduction\" was concerned. DREAM PARALYSIS Another technique, besides the \"inter- nal sound\" and \"mental struggle\" methods employed by Lori and Emily, was used by Melissa MacLeod, another Southland UFO witness with whom I had worked for several years. Melissa is a professional woman of middle years; I can vouch for her honesty and rationality. Beginning in 1977, she experienced repeated episodes during which invisible forms of considerable weight (estimated at 50 to 60 pounds or more) would \"sit\" on the side or the foot of her bed, jostling it or pok- ing her repeatedly until she awakened fully. When she opened her eyes, the feelings would cease, and there was never anything visible to explain what had caused them. Her husband never experienced anything out of the ordi- nary, and always believed she was dreaming or \"imagining.\" Eventually, Melissa lost her fear of the phenomena; although they occurred, on the average, once or twice each month, they never seemed harmful to her well-being. At times they were accompanied by vivid dreams relating to her career, and being a dabbler in dream interpretation, she wondered if the \"presences\" were alerting her to pay attention to particular dreams. Beginning in the early eighties, however, these episodes began to be accompanied by a type of paralysis. She would awaken to find herself unable to move; the first few times, by instinct, she mentally struggled against the paralysis, willing herself to break it. She found that, with sus- tained struggle, she could eventually succeed in moving some small por- tion of her body and the paralysis and invisible presences which accom- panied it would disappear. Melissa invariably experienced absolute terror during the struggles; she felt bitter aversion at being beseiged by an unknown agent. None of these expe- riences left Melissa with any con- scious memory of \"contact\" or any hint of UFO abduction. She does have a prior history of a \"time lapse\" or \"amnesic period\" following a 1953 experience in which she heard an unexplained, high-pitched whirring sound which reverberated through the Los Angeles apartment she and her husband occupied as newlyweds. At the time she was about three months pregnant. When the invisible presences began MUTUAL UFO Network Journal, Number 247, November 1988"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"to disturb her years later she did not relate them to the 1953 experience. However, in the mid-1980s, early one morning she awoke paralyzed and saw a dark, indistinct human-sized figure standing near her on the left side of the bed. Although this image was possibly hypnopompic (post-sleep) in nature, the experience caused stark terror. Though this was the only time a visible form accompanied the paralyzing episodes, the expe- rience prompted Melissa to develop another technique for warding them off. Being a Christian, during the next episode she prayed inwardly to Christ, beseeching Him for help and found that the paralysis ended somewhat more quickly. The last two episodes occurred in 1986 and 1987, and by this time she had begun to beseech the Archangel Michael directly, having a special devotion to this spiritual personage noted as a warrior against dark spir- its. She found that prayers directed to St. Michael broke the paralysis even more quickly. Having found what was to her a reliable way of breaking the episodes, she no longer fears future occurrences. Perhaps significantly, she has not had any recurrences of the episddes for over a year. Is Melissa's faith in the pro- tection of the Archangel Michael the equivalent of Emily and Lori's confi- dence in themselves as \"Persons with rights\"? All three techniques might be related, even though Emily and Lori's techniques are not associated with orthodox religion. Another technique for warding off strange phenomena was described in a* letter written .by Jan Whitley, another of the Tujunga Canyon wit- nesses. Jan, by 1981, had begun to MUTUAL UFO Network Journal, Number 247, November 1988 realize that certain persons had the ability to say \"no\" to unwanted con- tacts. She referred to a documentary shown on NBC about the Bermuda Triangle, which dramatized a case of a boatload of people confronted by a dread phenomenon. As Jan wrote in her typical succinct but powerful style, \"A man in boat saying No-no- no. And no it was — he of course was a survivor, not a victim — or should I say not removed from his environment.\" (6). Apparently, intense verbal thwarting of these entities will accomplish the same result as mental struggle, certain meditative techniques, and fervent prayer. Another Southland case involves a woman in her thirties, who reports repeated episodes at an earlier period in her life. They invariably began with an irritating, piercing noise, followed by the feeling of being clutched by 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"invisible \"hands.\" She reported suc- cess in fending off contact by \"biting through\" one of the hands on one occasion. It is the opinion of this woman, who is a thoroughly rational and realistic individual, that members of the human race have an equal right to resist intrusion by other- worldly entities. During this period in her life, she used other techniques as well, such as repeating the Our Father fervently and, at times, merely \"waiting out\" the piercing noise, etc. knowing that sustained resistance to it would eventually bring about its cessation. At this writing, an abductee sup- port group has been formed in the Los Angeles area, and protocol has been established for the gathering of medical and psychological data on abductees. Basic support techniques are being used in a group setting for the benefit of traumatized witnesses, assisting their return to normal, pro- ductive living. There is great interest by both researchers and abductees — especially those who report ongo- ing intervention by unknown entities — in trying out various techniques, as outlined above, to fend off these contacts. Preliminary work toward this end is now in progress. Some in the UFO research field — especially those persons who regard UFO entities as extraterrestrial vis- itors — may disagree with efforts to teach traumatized witnesses to fend off contact. Why prevent contact, including abductions, they might ask, if the main motives of the visitors are for the eventual good of the human race, possibly continued evolution of the race? OTHER DIMENSIONS It is my opinion, which other researchers share, that the \"UFO Phenomenon\" is a mixed-bag, some sightings being possibly of extrater- restrial beings/craft, while others are from intradimensional sources or \"paral- lel universes.\" The traditions and teachings of all great religions, as well as the folklore of every continent and culture, tell of entities, both benevo- lent and malevolent, from other planes of existence. If some of these reported 20 forms of life actually exist, they apparently can interact with our phys- ical world and communicate on var- ious levels with human beings. The non-benevolent types with which folk- lore abounds (7, 8) are practically indistinguishable, in their essential natures, from \"bedroom visitor\" enti- ties (9). The trappings with which they surround themselves, such as clothing, means of transport, etc., differ according to the culture and time period in which they are reported, and it is logical to assume that intrad- imensional creatures who have the means of entering our space/time would also have the power to sur- round themselves with modern, spec- tacular trappings, such as \"space craft.\" For those in the UFO field who say that \"abduction\" by UFO entities may traumatize witnesses but does not cause permanent harm, I would question their assessment of the \"abduction scenario.\" Many persons are, it is true, able to incorporate these experiences into their view of reality and proceed with productive living. Most of these latter persons are metaphysically-minded and regard the visitations as intriguing evidence of other types of Life other than human. But the majority of believable \"abduc- tion\" reports and cases of time-lapse/ potential \"abduction\" are from respon- sible, yet emotionally-damaged indi- viduals. The damage ranges from slight/ repairable to deep/irreparable. Some mechanism from an unknown source is profoundly affecting large numbers of our population. The human race, by reason of its very nature, has its own integrity, which includes the right to be free of unwanted interven- tion by creatures of unknown motives. Even on our own earth, species do not interbreed, and the rare excep- tion such as the mule and the so- called \"liger\" are invariably sterile (10). Each human being should have the right to choose whether or not they will interact with \"alien\" beings, and to know fully what interaction might mean to them. With our present dismal lack of knowledge regarding UFO entities — if indeed they are part of the \"real\" world and not products of the wit- nesses' minds — we do not seem able to communicate meaningfully with them. \"Communications\" have, to date, seemed personally satisfac- tory for some witnesses but for oth- ers have been filled with meaningless phrases, untruths, and contradictions. The techniques described above might put an end to the garbage they are handing out. The art of fending them off should be perfected, so that we can preserve our own integrity as human beings — a distinct creation — until the situation changes to our advantage. Some researchers hypothesize that interaction with \"UFO entities\", includ- ing suspected genetic experimenta- tion, will bring about continued evolu- tion of the human race. This might well be so. However, I contend that human evolution should forge ahead on our own volition, not as the result of \"merging\" or \"interbreeding\" with questionable creatures. When we have learned to fend them off, say \"no,\" and demand communication on our own terms, will that not be the start of real communication and knowl- edge? Will our own evolvement con- sist of developing our minds and psyches to communicate meaningfully with other intelligent species different from ourselves? At the very best, learning to say \"no\" to intrusion might start significant communication with them. At the very worst, it would rid our race of unwelcome trespass, even though this might leave behind an unsolved puzzle.

Looking Back ByBobGribble FORTY YEARS AGO - Novem- ber 1948: At about 9:45 PM on the 18th, Lt. Henry G. Combs was flying over Andrews Air Force Base near Washington, D.C., when he noticed a light moving north to south over the base. It appeared to be one continu- ous, glowing white light. He thought it was an aircraft with only one landing light so he moved in closer to check, as he wanted to get into the landing pattern. As he approached he noticed it was not another airplane. Just then it began to take violent evasive action. He switched his navigation lights on and off but got no response, so he went in closer, but the light quickly flew up and over his airplane. He then tried to close again but the light turned. \"I tried to turn inside of its turn and, at the same time, get the light between me and the moon, but even with my flaps lowered I couldn't turn inside the light,\" Combs said. Combs chased the light up and down and around for about ten min- utes, then as a last resort he made a pass and turned on his landing lights. Just before the light made a final turn right and headed for the coast he saw that it was a dark gray, oval-shaped object, smaller than his T-6. He couldn't tell if the light was on the object or if the whole object had been glowing. Two officers and a crew chief, a master sergeant, completely corroborated the pilot's report. They had been standing on the flight line and had witnessed the entire incident. The Air Weather Service said the light \"definitely was not a weather bal- loon.\" - *** THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO - November 1953: Two Royal Air Force pilots, Flying Officers T.S. Johnson and C.H. Smythe, sighted a UFO from their Vampire jet on the 3rd. Moving at tremendous speed, the object was also tracked on radar by the 256th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Reg- iment. Seven days later the British War Office confirmed the UFO en- counter and radar report and released statements from radar men and the two RAF pilots. Mr. and Mrs. Louis Dangelo, who live in San Fernando, California, were watching three jet planes flying over- head (exact date unknown) when they noticed a huge silver ball follow- ing the aircraft. \"We thought maybe it was a tow-target connected to one of the jets. But then the jets peeled off and landed,\" said Mrs. Dangelo. \"The silvery ball kept flying. It moved up and down, and even sideways. Finally, a long streamer of white stuff, almost like a vapor trail, spewed out of its back end. It detached itself from the ball and began settling earthward. It spread out, stringy, sort of, like white wool being shredded, and it drooped down all over the neighborhood like cobwebs. Wires running to our homes turned white.\" A bakery truck driver, Bob Tilt, rolled into the neighborhood about that time. \"I began noticing white stuff, like spider webs. It was every- where, all over my windshield,\" he said. \"I didn't see any of it in other neighborhoods that day. In fact, I've MUTUAL UFO Network Journal, Number 247, November 1988 never seen anything like it before.\" One family reported the incident to Lockheed Aircraft Corporation in Bur- bank. In the words of one woman: \"An engineer was sent out to see us. He was young and cocky, and approach- ed us with a very sneering attitude. When he left, with a handful of the white stuff, he was silent and bug- eyed. The next day an engineer came from North American Aviation, and on the third day one from Douglas. They've never told us what they learned, but we've heard the stuff could not be analyzed.\" *** THIRTY YEARS AGO - Novem- ber 1958: Wayne Cole spotted a UFO about 10 PM on the 2nd as he approached his farm home near Happy, Texas. Cole said he saw a blue object traveling about 100 feet above the roadway and as he drove directly under the object the ampere meter on his car jumped from charge to full charge and the car engine stopped. The object then moved away, climbing at a terrific rate of speed, trailing ,a red stream of fire behind it. On the following day, the 3rd, Charlton Harrell observed a UFO descending into the atmosphere at a high rate of speed, leaving a wide white trail. Suddenly, the object stopped abruptly several thousand feet above and just west of Virginia Beach, Vir- ginia. The time was about 5 PM. The UFO seemed to be a silvery or white, long cylindrical object, and appeared to emit a stream of white smoke as it hung stationary in the sky. After sev- eral minutes, the UFO began moving slowly southward and descending. Then it stopped again, then moved more to the southwest, and finally, after about ten minutes, it disap- peared behind the trees. Harrell said dozens of other motorists also saw the UFO. *** TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO - November 1963: During the night of the 12th, a large UFO was signted from the stern of the Argentine Navy transport, A.R.A. \"Punta Medanos\" 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"(exact location unknown). The huge object was round-shaped and moving at a high speed. It had no lights and made no sound. When the UFO appeared, the needles of the ship's magnetic compasses suddenly and simultaneously swung off course, point- ing toward the UFO. At the time the object was about 2000 meters away from the ship. After the object was gone, the compasses returned to normal. *** TWENTY YEARS AGO - Novem- ber 1968: The most fascinating case of UFO healing on record took place in the French Alps involving a Dr. \"X\". Because he held an official posi- tion in his town, the doctor chose to remain anonymous. Dr. X is 43, and the father of a small son. Before stepping on a mine during the Alger- ian War, he was a gifted pianist, but the resulting paralysis of both limbs on his right side ended his piano play- ing and left him with a noticeable limp. One other fact is pertinent: three days before the episode, while Dr. X was chopping wood, the ax slipped and wounded him on the leg just above the ankle. The wound was treated immediately, but on the night of the 1st, he was still in pain and walked with extreme difficulty. Some- time after 3 AM on the morning of the 2nd, during a rainstorm, Dr. X was awakened by his 14-month-old son calling from his crib. In the nursery he perceived, through closed shutters, powerful flashes of light he assumed to be lightning. He gave the baby its bottle, painfully descended the stairs, and went to the kitchen for a drink of water. By then, the rain had stopped, but not the light flashes. At some point Dr. X realized he had heard no thunder. He went to the liv- ing room, opened the French win- dows wide, stepped out onto the ter- race, and saw, far down the valley, two identical, luminous disc-shaped objects with horizontal and vertical antennas from which the flashes of brilliant light were being emitted at one second intervals. The two discs started moving up the valley toward him, at the same 22 time drawing nearer to one another. Amazed, Dr. X watched the \"inner antennae interpenetrate each other and then disappear entirely\" as the twin objects came into contact and actually fused, the two discs becom- ing one! The single disc continued to approach Dr. X's house until, at about 200 meters from where he stood, it stopped and remained sta- tionary. Then a light beam emanating from the disc (which was later calcu- lated to be approximately 140 feet long and 35 feet thick) began moving toward him. The rotation of the disc's lower portion speeded up formidably, the disc tilted, and Dr. X \"received the light beam, which shone all over him. At the moment when the light- beam reached him he instinctively covered his face.\" An instant later, Dr. X heard a bang like a firecracker and the object suddenly vanished. Badly shaken, Dr. X returned to the kitchen and made notes on what he had seen, including sketches of the discs. He then went upstairs, woke his wife, and told her what had happened. Suddenly, his wife cried out, \"Your leg!\" Dr. X, who was striding back and forth and talking excitedly, was no longer limp- ing. He pulled up his pajama leg. The ax wound was completely healed. A short time later all signs of his Alger- ian War wound — which had remained unchanged for 10 years — had com- pletely vanished. He also was able to play the piano again as well as ever. A chemical analysis failed to pro- vide an identity for a substance which floated down from a UFO over Hous- ton, Texas on the 3rd. Robert Hub- bard, 15, and David Kelley, 17, reported that they had observed the object and like others, gathered the curious substance from the area. \"Look at the funny jet,\" Hubbard said he heard a child shout to his mother as he played football at 4:15 PM. \"I looked up and it looked like a coin on its side with a dome and black dots like windows. I looked at it for about two minutes. It started going up slowly and disappeared when a jet air- liner came out of the north,\" Hub- bard said. \"A few minutes later a Delta wing jet circled the area and left.\" Kelley said he and Hubbard retrieved the hair-like fibers which began falling over the area before the jets arrived. Some of the substance reached the hands of David Wuliger at the Uni- versity of Houston. Wuliger said a chemist, who requested anonymity for himself and his company, agreed to analyze it in the laboratory of a multi-million dollar petroleum com- pany. \"Microscopic and tactile exam- ination indicates the substance is fibrous, elastic, relatively strong, some- what sticky and white in color,\" Wuliger said. \"It looked like rope with many fibers under a powerful micro- scope, but after being carbonized, it appeared to have a honeycomb struc- ture. The fact it only changed color when it was heated indicated it was organic,\" Wuliger said the chemist told him. The chemist was unable to determine what the substance was. *** FIFTEEN YEARS AGO - Novem- ber 1973: Taking a short-cut through a neighbor's backyard, two 11-year- old youths were startled when they came across a strange, unfamiliar object, about 11 feet high and 20 feet in diameter, sitting in the middle of an adjoining vacant lot. At approximately 7:00 PM on the 16th, Richard Thiel and Danny Fleming of Lemon Grove, California, spotted the object which they first thought was a water tank. \"We were puzzled,\" said Fleming, \"because we'd been there a few days ago, and the 'tank' wasn't there.\" The boys stood about 15 or 20 feet from the object before they moved any closer. Then they approached the object, and one of the youths banged it with a flashlight. Abruptly, the dome-like section on the top glowed in a brilliant red, and the object rose three or four feet from the ground and began to rotate. \"Everything around,\" said Fleming, \"turned red. We immediately ran away.\" As the object rose from the ground, green lights on the peripheral rim came on and began blinking on and off. The object emitted a strange sound as it ascended, somewhat like that of a wailing siren. As the boys Continued on page 23 MUTUAL UFO Network Journal, Number 247, November 1988"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Letters to the Editor... Dear Editor, . After reading Dr. Michael Persinger's article on \"Possible Increased Cancer and Depression Risk Among UFO Field Researchers and Populations Near Flap Areas,\" my first reaction was that the giant Inco smoke stack in Sudbury was not only causing acid rain, but causing people to write silly articles. However, for two reasons it became imperative that the article had to be answered. Firstly, Dr. Persinger singles out Carman, Manitoba, as a possible area to test his theory. Having sighted the famous Carman UFO more times than anyone outside the Carman area, and having interviewed almost every Car- man resident who had experienced multiple sightings, I felt someone quali- fied should respond on behalf of those involved. More importantly, I learned that Penny Rolf, producer for Michael B. Seligman Productions, had contacted the publisher of the Carman area paper to check on the sightings of thirteen years ago. She followed this up by ask- ing how everyone's health was. It there- fore seemed possible that some unin- formed people might actually believe this flat earth nonsense. A quick check of the witnesses who had experienced multiple sightings (close to 100) finds all in good health with no cancer. As for myself, I found myself in good health the last time I checked. Stephen Michalak is probably the best example of the possible side effects of encounters with Dr. Persin- ger's earthquake lights. Michalak got close enough to the 35-foot earthquake light (with a door in it) to touch it. (Fal- con Lake, Manitoba, May 20, 1967) Twenty-one years later Michalak shows none of the side effects outlined by Persinger. I will admit that if one extends the time frame to say fifty years and takes a large enough population sample, one would probably come across some variations indicating cancer and depression. They would, however, also show pregnancy, heart attacks and maybe even AIDS. Do earthquake lights cause these, too? As to the theory of the earthquake lights itself: Sightings occurred almost nightly in the Carman area for about fourteen months, stopping as suddenly as they began. There have been literally no sightings since then until just recently. Should Carman residents prepare for a second big earthquake now that we have had a few sightings reports? The problem is, Carman residents don't seem to remember the first big earth- quake. No one in the town has ever felt an earthquake, so maybe it came and everyone mistook it for a train? Howard Bennett, publisher of the Carman area paper, summed up the situation with typical small town logic. \"Maybe someone should check the health of the Professor.\" As for the researchers and popula- tion that I have discussed this theory with, the only common symptom they all seem to share is uncontrollable laughter, and that seems only to have started after the August '88 MUFON UFO Journal became public here. — Grant Cameron Winnepeg, Manitoba Dear Editor, The publication of Walter Webb's article in the 1988 MUFON Proceed- ings marks a small milestone. If the facts are as Mr. Webb reported them, it is very hard to sustain the hypothesis of the fantasy-prone personality as an explanation for abduction cases. I have never considered this a particularly strong candidate as an explanation for abduction cases, but the abduction case that Webb analyzed is as near water-tight as one can imagine. In addi- tion to the impressive body of evidence collected by Budd Hopkins and Dave Jacobs, as well as others, our options for alternative explanations to the abduction business are narrowing. Increas- ingly, the shrill voices of Klass, et al., are loosing ground (exception: in The Skeptical Inquirer, where truth always takes a back seat to \"hard-hitting\" rhe- toric) in the face of this evidence. MUTUAL UFO Network Journal, Number 247, November 1968 As the evidence accumulates, other things are happening. I am told that a movie based on Strieber's book is not far off, to be financed to the tune of $40 million. If this is true, one wonders what the population's response will be. If so many people in American society have been abducted, how do we explain the lack of emotional response to \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind?\" Even though the movie struck me as sugar-coated, there should still have been enough content to raise the hackles of a former abductee or two. Yet, to the best of my knowledge, such reactions have not been reported. Very different from the frightened reactions to the cover of Strieber's book. It also strikes me as odd, if we have so many abductees, that our cultural media is not more permeated by abduction themes. After all, there must be plenty of playwrights, artists, and writers, who have been abductees, and their creative works should be attempts to work through these previous experiences. Why, then, are these influences not more evident? — Ron Westrum Ypsilanti, MI BACK, continued ran, they experienced unusual sensa- tions. \"It felt to me like I was trying to run underwater,\" reported Fleming. \"Rich- ard said he felt it was like trying to run in stow motion. We felt a tingting sensation all over. It felt as though the hair on our arms was standing up, but we couldn't be sure.\" The boys kept running until they reached young ThiePs backyard. From there they looked back and saw the object disappear into some clouds. The estimated time at this point was 7:20 PM. Examination of the landing area reveal- ed three narrow holes, each about eight inches deep. The impressions formed an equilateral triangle with seven-foot sides. There was dry grass and branches pressed down into the holes. Dead grass around the landing depression was apparently ly- ing in a counter-clockwise pattern. The ground consisted of very hard, dry clay. Investigators estimated something extreme- ly heavy would have been necessary to make the impressions as they appeared. It was also discovered that a magnome- ter located about 60 miles east of the landing site, at Mt. Palomar Naval Elec- tronics Lab, triggered at exactly 7:20 PM that same evening. 23"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Exopsychology — A Study Of Alien Beings How do aliens behave? What do they think? Do they use body lan- guage? What are their personality traits? How do they communicate? These are a few of the questions being asked by scientists who are studying the possibilities of contacting space aliens. These topics and more will be covered by a new branch of science known as Exopsychology. One approach to alien contact is known as SETI or the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. Huge radio telescopes are aimed at specific points in space and bursts of radio signals are beamed out there. The assump- tion used by scientists in this camp is that aliens communicate much the way we do. While it is possible that our signals may have been received and answered by aliens, we have not yet recognized such messages. So, the search goes on. Another approach is to study UFO reports and the alleged encounters between humans and aliens. While some scientists categorize UFO reports as impossible, the number of credible accounts of contact continues to climb. Eyewitnesses have described a variety of alien critters, many with the capability of communicating without speaking, great strength, unusual beha- vioral characteristics, and strange personalities. Using either approach, scientists begin their work by assuming the aliens have the ability to communi- cate in the same manner as humans and behave as we do also. This assumption could be correct or com- pletely wrong. That is because it is based upon the educated guesses of human engineers and scientists. Life originating elsewhere may take many forms. Some of them may be able to communicate across vast dis- tances, but we may not yet be able to interpret their signals. Others may be able to travel across those same miles. Their lifespan could be much longer than ours and their method of space travel may appear as science fiction to humans. That is why the broad field of Exopsychology will gain in popularity in coming years. 24 Presently, no one speaks for the whole planet. Aliens coming here would encounter a bizarre range of ideas, religions, cultures, political sys- tems, and humans of various sizes, shapes, and colors. Exopsychologists can pave the way for productive meetings in the future by studying and predicting the behavior, attitudes, personalities and thoughts of aliens. A team sponsored by the United Nations may be necessary if Earth is to be prepared for the future, a future that can only be imagined at present. — John F.

The Night Sky By Walter N. Webb MUFON Astronomy Consultant November 1988 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Mars, in Pisces, is low in the ESE at dusk and then advances across the southern sky. During November the red planet fades another magnitude (from -1.8 to -0.8) as the Earth continues to recede from it. The Martian disc diameter decreases to 13 seconds of arc by the end of the month (from a September maximum of 24 seconds). Jupiter, still retrograding in Taurus between the Hyades and the Pleiades, rises in the NE about an hour after sunset early in the month then at sunset on the 22nd when it is opposite the Sun. Shining brilliantly at mag- nitude -2.9, the big world remains visible all night. Saturn, in Sagittarius, lies low in the SW at dusk early in November, set- ting about 7:30 PM on the 1st, about 6:30 in midmonth, and only about an hour and a half after sunset on the 30th. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus rises in the east about 3 hours before sunrise in mid-November and can be seen gleaming brightly in the SE at dawn. The crescent Moon is near Venus and Mercury on the 6th. Mars sets in the west soon after 2 AM in midmonth. Jupiter sets in the NW around sunrise. Meteor Showers: Two small meteor showers occur every November — the Taurids, which climax about the 2nd, and the Leonids on the 17th. The former radiate from Taurus the Bull at a rate of about 15 per hour; the last-quarter Moon interferes on the morning of the peak. The latter appear to emanate from the Sickle of Leo at a similar rate before dawn. The Taurids are slower and reddish while the Leonids are swift and bluish.

While the Summer Triangle still lingers low in the west, the 25"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"bright patterns of winter — Orion, Taurus, Auriga, and Gemini — climb above the eastern horizon. Below the Great Square and covering the whole southern sky from SW to SE is the faintest region of the heavens known as \"The Sea.\" The aquatic constellations include Capricornus the Sea Goat, which looks more like a diaper than an animal; Aquarius the Water Bearer (look for a \"Y\" of four stars marking the water jar); Pisces the Fish (look for a pentagon of stars below the Great Square, one.of the two fish, connected to a big \"V\" — two ribbons tied to the creatures); Cetus the Sea Monster (the beast's head is another pentagon east of the \"V\"); and Eridanus the River, which winds its obscure way across the sky between Cetus and Orion. The only bright star in The Sea is Fomalhaut, sometimes called the Solitary One, in Piscis Austrinus the Southern Fish. The star is found by running a line nearly straight down through the western side of the Great Square and beyond. On the 30th the last-quarter Moon occults Regulus in Leo throughout the U.S. except the Southwest. The farther west one is, the darker the morn- ing sky will be and the easier it is to see the event. Use binoculars or a telescope. In the East the reappearance of the Star flirts with the glare of the rising Sun. Some local times of disappearance and reappearance: Denver, 2:53-3:58; Kansas City, 4:06-5:25; Chicago, 4:11-5:36; Washington, 5:32-6:58; Atlanta, 5:30-6:53; Miami, 5:58-7:13. In Others' Words By Lucius Parish Some UFO researchers have been intrigued by Ronald Reagan's numer- ous references to the possibility of an alien invasion and the nations of the world uniting to combat such a threat. Now, the National Enquirer reports (October 11 issue) that, when he was governor of California, Rea- gan saw a UFO approach his plane and was allegedly very impressed by the sighting. He later made a study of the subject, but apparently consi- dered that it might not help his future political chances if he was known as a UFO \"believer.\" The August 30 issue of The Star told of TV talk-show host Morton Downeys Jr.'s claim that he was abducted by aliens in 1953. Dr. Jean Mundy will hypnotize Downey in an attempt to determine what happened during a 40-minute \"missing time\" period. Jerome Clark contributes the \"Anti- Matter/UFO Update\" feature in the September issue of OMNI, discussing 26 the controversial claim that a UFO crashed near Aztec, N.M. in 1948. This story has been the subject of a recent book, UFO Crash At Aztec by William Steinman & Wendelle C. Stevens. This same column in the October issue features the activities of researcher Mike Luckman and the New York Center for UFO Research. Jennie Zeldman's article in the October issue of Fate discusses re- ports of similar boomerang-shaped UFOs in Ohio and North Carolina, some 12 years apart. She also men- tions the many sightings of similar objects in the Hudson River Valley area during the 1982-86 period.

BOOKS \"Uninvited Guests: A Documented History of UFO Sightings, Alien Encount- ers and Coverups\" by Richard Hall, now available, is highly recommended to both the experienced UFO research- er and to the vast number of new people coming into the field. Mr. Hall's book is not only an excellent history of Ufology worldwide, but a compelling treatise on all aspects of the phenomenon to challenge the reader's personal thoughts and theor- ies.

For those people looking for the sequel to \"Communion,\" the best seller by Whitley Strieber in 1987, they now have the opportunity to indulge in many of Mr. Strieber's \"New Age\" experiences and specula- tions as he attempts to seek answers to these problems in his life and that of correspondents.

The Cosgrove-Meurer Productions pro- gram \"Unsolved Mysteries\" that appear- ed October 5th after the Vice-Presiden- tial debate on NBC-TV devoted one segment of their show or fourteen minutes of air time to the \"Gulf Breeze, Florida Case.\" They were unable to use all the material submit- ted to their producers due to time limitations, however, it was profes- sionally done and gave favorable attention to this important UFO case. MUFON is indebted to Kris Palmer for accepting the recommendation of Walt Andrus to produce this docu- mentary for television. The Michael B. Seligman Produc- tion's special two-hour TV documen- tary titled, \"UFO Cover-Up Live,\" aired on October 14, 1988. Distrib- uted by Lexington Broadcast System (LBS) to independent TV stations, it was an outstanding UFO documen- tary. It endeavored to provide cre- dence to the government's actual forty-one year old cover-up of the UFO phenomenon through the tes- timony of people and researchers sharing knowlege and factual informa- tion in an attempt to expose the cover-up. We sincerely hope that members of the U.S. Congress, heads of our armed forces, and the adminis- trative leaders of U.S. intelligence agencies viewed the documentary, so they will become better informed and take positive action to unveil the mystery surrounding the UFO phe- nomenon. Unquestionably, this dis- closure must be made — why not now? NEW OFFICERS In our quest to have a State Sec- tion Director for every county in the 28 United States to coordinate the activ- ities of the Field Investigators, the fol- lowing dedicated people have volun- teered their services: On June 8, 1988, Robert L. Oechsler of Edge- water, Maryland was appointed for Anne Arundel, Howard, and Calvert Counties. (Bob has done some excel- lent research on the Gulf Breeze Case and recently appeared on the TV program \"Unsolved Mysteries\"); Keith Tarpley, living in Harriman, Tennessee, was assigned to the coun- ties of Roane, Laudon, Morgan, And- erson and Knox; Delbert E. Ander- son, residing in Laurelville, Ohio, accepted the responsibility for Hock- ing and Rose Counties and amateur radio operator NW8I; Don F. Ecker II of Boise was appointed to Ada, Canyon and Elmore Counties in Idaho by Don Mason, State Director for Idaho; Cecil H. Gates of Lake Almanor, Calif, volunteered for Plu- mas County; George B. Bishop of Fort Worth has accepted the reins for Tarrant and Parker Counties in Texas; Art Koskela, a former State Section Director living in Wisconsin Rapids, has accepted the responsibil- ity for Wood, Portage, Marathon, Juneau, and Adams County in Wis- consin; Skip D. Schultz of Wood- burn, Oregon has been reassigned to Marion, Polk and Yamhill Counties; and John and Mary Sanders, pres- ently Co-State Section Directors now living in Beaumont, Texas, have been reassigned to Jefferson, Orange and Hardin Counties. James A. Scarborough, Ph.D., a physics professor at Delta State Uni- versity in Cleveland, Mississippi is ful- filling the dual role of Consultant in Physics and State Section Director for Bolivar, Sunflower, Washington and Coahoma Counties. Carlos J. DeLeon, Ph.D., residing in Ponce, Puerto Rico, is a new Consultant in Hypnotherapy and has joined the rapidly expanding team of investiga- tors headed by Anna Gloria Colon, State Director for Puerto Rico. New Research Specialists volunteering dur- ing the past month are Irene Peirce, M.A. of Biloxi, Mississippi in Educa- tion and David R. Wojcik, M.S. liv- ing in Chelmsford, Mass, for Electri- cal Engineering. Joe Santangelo's term as Eastern Regional Director is expiring. He has fulfilled two consecutive terms, there- fore he may not run for reelection according to MUFON bylaws. Anyone living in the Eastern Region of states consisting of ME, NH, VT, MA, CT, RI, NY, PA, MD, NJ, DE, WV, VA, NC, SC, GA, FL, DC and PR inter- ested in being elected to this impor- tant position should advise their State Director so they may be formally nominated. State Directors may nom- inate themselves. The deadline for receiving nominations is November 30, 1988 in Seguin, Texas. This is an opportunity for a dedicated person to help influence the goals and objec- tives of MUFON and the future of Ufology. Please give this matter your prompt and serious consideration, since only one nomination has been proposed as of October 12, 1988. CONFERENCES John Lear, State Director for Nevada and host chairman for the MUFON 1989 International UFO Sym- posium, is pleased to announce that the symposium will be held on the weekend of June 30, July 1 and 2, 1989 in the Convention Center of the Aladdin Hotel and Casino, 3667 South Las Vegas Blvd., in Las Vegas, NV 89109.
