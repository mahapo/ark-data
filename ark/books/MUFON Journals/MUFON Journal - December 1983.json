FROM THE EDITOR How many times have you heard someone say, \"Ninety percent of all UFO sightings can be explained,\" etc.? Or said it yourself? Wherever did we get that figure from? How valid is it? How valid are any UFO statistics? The fact is, we don't have the slightest idea how many people have seen UFOs. Many (most?) people never report their sightings, for various reasons. And many sightings that are reported to the media or police die right there. Some witnesses are referred to local UFO investigators or someone life the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle, but how many? There is no single agency that collects all the sighting reports. And how many investigators clutter their files with data on IFOs? Why should they? So, how valid are UFO statistics? Does it even matter? What we do know is that in the files of researchers and organizations around the world are the investigation reports on hundreds of thousands of sightings of what can only be called unidentified flying objects. Those are the statistics that count.

Two weekly newspapers, AS and Illustrovaha Politika, reported that the amateur astronomers had gathered at the municipal observatory in Split. Two of them, Tonci Qsibov and Ivica Vucemilo, were in the cupola, where they were observing the constellation Vulpecula through a telescope, watching for meteors. The others were in the club one floor below, working on theoretical astronomy under the tutorship of one of them, Goran Ergovic. A few minutes after 8 PM, their study was suddenly interrupted when Osibov and Vucemilo began shouting excitedly. The seven studying ran up to the terrace and all watched as a peculiar object flew at great height from the direction of Solta Island toward Kastela Bay. Their first thought was that it was a satellite, but then they decided it couldn't be because of the brilliance and because it kept changing in intensity. They continued to watch and, unable to determine what it was, they decided to carefully observe it and chart its movement, watching it through the telescope and other Diagram shows how smaller object moved around main object instruments. It was then 8:10 PM. The object maintained the same height and speed for the next four minutes, but the intensity of the bluish- white light kept changing. It flew over Ciovo Island, Kastela Bay and the peaks of Kozjak and seemed as if it would disappear at any moment behind the peaks of Marjan. But... \"It stopped!\" shouted Ergovic, who had been following it through the telescope. In the next moment he spotted another, smaller object that gave off a strong orange light. The new body began to circle slowly around the front part of the primary object and it was not possible to observe it all the time. This lasted for three minutes, and then the orange-colored object seemed to fuse with the blue-white one, which then turned a bit to the right, grew more and more red and headed north at a fairly high speed. It disappeared beyond the forests of Marjan in three minutes. Impressed by what they saw, they were inclined to believe the object was most probably a UFO, having coresponded to descriptions of UFOs they had often read about in newspapers and literature. Their observation diary reads that they observed an \"unusual phenomenon\" and emphasized the fact that \"any similarity to airplanes or satellites should be out of any consideration.\" They calculated the object's (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"UFO HOTLINE REPORTS ByBOBGRIBBLE Sept. 19, 1983, 8:55 PM, Tompkins Cove, New York: A square-shaped object — estimated to be 40 feet in diameter and showing four brilliant white lights — was observed in a stationary position over high voltage electric transmission lines. The three witnesses were riding in a car and reported that the object followed them and approached to within 200 feet of the car. The witnesses fled to a neighbor's house and observed the object until it moved away. From inside the house they could hear a humming sound. They had the object under observation for about six minutes. Dec. 7, 1983, 9 PM, near Cedarburg, Wisconsin: A car with a mother and two young children had just exited from the northbound ramp on I- 43 when they noticed a brilliant white light descending from the sky and approaching their vehicle. As the light got closer, the driver stopped the car and got out for a better look. The light stopped when it was directly overhead at an estimated altitude of 200 feet. At Bob Cribble, director of the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle, Washington, has graciously consented to furnish the MUFON UFO Journal with a monthly roundup of reports of UFO sightings received by the center. Although most of the incidents must still be thoroughly investigated, it was felt that Journal readers would appreciate knowing what is currently being reported throughout the nation. The names of all the witnesses in the accompanying report are on file at the Center in Seattle. that point the mother observed a huge object as large as four jet aircraft and shaped like a cooking Wok. Lighted openings were observed on what was described as the front end of the craft. The witness heard no sound as the craft hovered overhead for approximately six minutes. As the craft departed from the area all of the windows on her car fogged-up. Dec. 20, 1983, 5:30 PM, Riverside, California: A small sphere — estimated to be six-to-eight inches in diameter and having pegs protruding from the surface — approached to within 20 feet of a car at windshield level. Constantly pulsating from red to silver, the bright ball maneuvered in front of the car for about 45 seconds before moving away. According to the driver, other cars were nearby and should have seen the object. Dec. 26,1983,9:33 PM, Omaha, Nebraska: Several witnesses observed a square object descend between two buildings and stop at about the second story level. Estimated to be about three feet in diameter, the object had an X-pattern of white lights on its underside. After viewing the object for several seconds at a distance (continued on next page) (Yugoslavia, continued) course across the sky covered about 120 degrees, moving from the direction of the constellation Vulpecula, passing through Lyra and Draco and coming under the center of Ursa Major before heading north. Ergovic reported that later that same evening, at exactly 10:01 PM, he saw another object as he was going home. \"I spotted a smaller object in the sky that moved in the same direciton,\" he said. \"It emanated a strong orange light. Together with some passersby, I observed it for a full nine minutes.\" Newspaper reports said the 4 \"object\" was a natural phenomenon that results from a change in air pressure which \"formed electric loads in the shape of a ball and a secondary light that enables them to change their shape, size and direction.\" The newspapers also said the nine amateur astronomers stated that what they saw was \"only atmospherics.\" This angered the amateur astronomers. \"None of us ever gave such a statement,\" said Ergovic, \"and on the basis of our observations, we most determinedly refuse such an interpretation. \"The object was oblong shaped and of whitish-bluish brightness while atmospheric clearances look like heated balls. Besides, they move extraordinarily fast while the unknown object was visible for ten minutes and it floated for three minutes in one spot at a very great height.\" Ergovic said the group's calculations indicated that as the object moved between Cape Marjan and Ciovo Island, its speed was 257 kilometers an hour and its height was 60,641 meters. The other witnesses were Dragan Nakir, Dragan Solic, Darko Selakovic, Ante Denic, Ivan Babic and Ergovic's brother, Zoran. Split is on the Adriatic Coast approximately 100 miles southwest of Sarajevo, site of the 1984 winter Olympics."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"(G nibble, continued) estimated to be 500 feet, the object ascended at an angle and moved out of sight. No sound was heard. Dec. 27, 1983, 10:30 PM, Indianapolis, Indiana: A small disc- shaped object with eight bright green lights descended from the sky and landed in an open field across the street from the home of the witness. After about ten seconds, the bright lights suddenly went out and the disc was no longer visible. Hoping to see the disc take off, .the, woman' continued to observe the area for an hour before retiring for the night. A second .report was received from a woman driving in the,same area during'the 1 same time, period. She observed a fixed group of bright green lights descending from the sky and appear to land in a corn field. Jan. 4, 1984, 10:40 PM, Crescent, Iowa: For about 60 seconds a stunned witness observed a bright light with a red glint make an angular high speed descent from, high altitude and come to an- instant stop. The light then shot across the sky at high speed, making several 90-degree turns and then making another instant stop. Then the light went into a high speed vertical climb and faded into the clear night sky. Jan. 7, 1984, 3:45 AM, Near Edenton, North Carolina: A father and his 15-year-old son watched in amazement as a' meteor-like object maneuvered at high altitude and high speed, making several 90-degree turns, Ipop-to-loops, up and down movements like the line pattern on an oscilloscope, instant reverse of direction and'instant stops and starts. 'The aerial display continued for 50 minutes against a clear sky. Jan. 8, 1984, Night, Framing- ham, Massachusetts: A narrow shaft of green light — beamed thru a MUFON 103 OLDTOWNE RD. SEGUIN.TX 78155 bedroom window — was aimed into the right eye of the witness. The man said he could feel heat and pain in the eye at the time. During the estimated five- minute duration of his experience, he said he could hear a whirring sound and noticed the faint outline of a \"being\" outside the window, then everything suddenly vanished. His wife said she examined his right eye and that it was \"all bloodshot\" and that the left eye was very normal. Jan. 9, 1984, 6:30 AM, near Capron, Indiana: While driving his truck down a country road, the witness observed a large meteor-like object ,in a high speed vertical descent to, the left of his vehicle. He lost sight of the object for a few seconds at tree level. Sudden- ly, an object covered with white lights appeared at treetop level on the left side of his vehicle, maneuvered around behind the truck, then passed the truck on the right side and moved down the highway and out of sight. The'driver described the object as looking like a football turned up on end, metallic-grey in color, about 150 feet tall and moving about 50 feet off the ground and about 100 feet from his vehicle. He could detect no sound ,and observed the object for about one minute. Jan. 9, 1984, 8 PM, about 15 miles north of Mojave, California: A Volkswagen camper drove under a submarine-shaped object while driving south on U.S. Highway 395. The driver and front seat passenger said the object had several red lights on the bottom, appeared to be stationary over the roadway at an altitude of about 100 feet and that it had a diameter about twice as wide as the highway. The driver stopped the camper on the shoulder of the highway and the four passengers got out to watch the object as it moved away to the north. They could hear no sound. Later when they stopped for gas they talked to several people in four other cars who said they had also seen the object. We received two additional reports from witnesses who saw the object from two different vantage points.

Holt, NASA scientist and MUFON research specialist; Marge Christensen, state director for Massachusetts; Cynthia Hind, MUFON Coordinator for Africa; and Paul A. Norman, MUFON state director for Victoria, Australia. driving on Route 208 West, the driver and passenger observed a strange object with lights descending and moving away from their car. After driving another 300 feet they spotted another object directly over the roadway and shaped like an inverted parabolic radar antenna. The car passed directly under the object; which was moving slowly ,at an estimated altitude of 200 feet. When the driver moved the car to the side of the road and stopped, the object increased speed and moved away toward the first object, which was about a mile away. He estimated the object to be about 75 feet in diameter and he said, he could hear no sound coming from it. The duration of the incident was about five minutes. 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"JOIN THE CAMPAIGN TO LIFT SECRECY LID How do we finally pry the lid off government UFO secrecy? One way is to get Congress to doit. How? By organizing a letter-writing campaign aimed at pursuading Congress to hold open hearings on UFO secrecy. This suggestion came at an informal meeting of MUFON members and other researchers at the second annual conference on Exploring Unexplained Phenomena, held at the University of Nebraska in November. Ray Boeche, organizer of the conference, said he had had some luck in 1983 in setting Nebraska Senators James Exon and Edward Zorinsky to question the U.S. Air Force on UFO secrecy. \"Senator Zorinsky has agreed to take a list of 10 to 15 of what we feel are the most pertinent questions to be answered regarding UFOs and he will direct them with his endorsement and his push for correct answers to the appropriate agencies,\" Boeche said. \"It's easy to pay lip service to this, but how many of you would be willing to go home and write to both of your senators and say, 'I want answers to this'?\" There were 20 to 25 men and women at the meeting and all raised their hands. It was agreed that (1) the letters should not be identical and each letter should be tailored to the writer's individual interests, and (2) the letters should be accompanied by copies of several previously classified government documents relating to UFO incidents. \"Demand an explanation why those documents exist,\" said Larry Bryant, who has campaigned against government UFO secrecy for a long time. \"Zero in on secrecy, not on lights in the sky or Project Blue Book, but zero in on those documents that point to the tip of the iceberg. Stress the fact that UFO secrecy exists, that the Senate should know about it and that the citizens are opposed to it.\" 6 Some documents suggested include those relating to the intrusion of UFOs over the nuclear weapons storage areas at Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque and the landing of a UFO outside a U.S. Air Force Base at Bentwaters, England (No. 188, October 1983). Said Bryant: \"The thing is to separate the executive and legislative branch and make the legislative branch do its homework. In other words, have a subcmmittee of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is headed by Barry Goldwater, hold hearings and. subpoena witnesses from the ranks of retired military and from sources that maybe Len Stringfield and Bill Moore know about, and go for legislative jugular vein.\" One person familiar with government operations also suggested: \"Emphasize the fact that there are a lot of people in the intelligence community and the Department of the Air Force, many of whom are now retired, who have a lot to contribute — but out of FEAR, absolute fear, won't say a thing, and until that threat is lifted they won't come forward and talk.\" MUFON members who write to their congressmen might also want to send a carbon copy to MFUON Headquarters and keep us posted on what the reaction is from your congressmen. SAMPLE LETTER Following is a sample letter that can be used as a guide in writing to your Senator or Congressman: Dear : If we were to have a public opinion poll on the question \"Do you believe the U.S. Government has leveled with the American people on the UFO problem?\" I'm afraid that more than 75 per cent of the respondents would answer \"No.\" That's one of the inferences I would draw from a recent UFO research conference at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Another inference is that unless the U.S. Congress acts to hold open committee hearings on the scope and purpose of official UFO secrecy, the public stands to remain ill informed (if not mis- informed) about the continuing role of the federal government in UFO research. Periodic \"leaks\" of official UFO- related documentation to the public, plus recent actions under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act on the part of privately funded UFO researchers, point to the tip of the iceberg that has international implications. That tip shows a deliberate, sustained effort by certain federal agencies to collect and analyze hard- core UFO date — along with an equally sustained effort to keep the results of that analysis secret. In a nation founded on citizens' participation in governmental decision- making and on the public's right to know, the continued federal policy and practices of UFO secrecy — ranging from agencies' denial of access to official UFO-related records to total suppression of data on alleged crash- landed UFOs and their retrieved occupants — ought to be enough incentive for the Congress to review that policy. Enclosed are copies of official documents that have been obtained under the Freedom of Information Act that show definite UFO intrusions into highly classified areas of some of our military bases. How can this happen? Why does this happen? Why does the government keep such things secret from the public? It is time for Congress to require the Executive branch and the various agencies involved to explain why they are keeping such matters secret."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"18.00 D 18.01-18.03 18.10 PYRAMID-SHAPED 'RAY FIELD 1 VANISHES FROM THE TOP DOWN These sketches were made by a German UFO organization, Gemeinschaft zur Erforschung unbekannter Phanomene (GEP) following investigation of a sighting on May 24,1983, in Juchen, which is near Grevenbroich, West Germany. The lone witness in the case is Jurgen R.,. 14, a grammar school student who was standing with a walkie talkie at the edge of a field about 30 meters behind his parents' house. It was about 6 PM when he saw a red, relativly round object come shooting down out of the clouds. The object positioned itself above some electric power transmission lines about 350 meters southeast of him. After a short time, the object began to build a \"ray field\" over the lines in the shape of a pyramid. The field was red with the inside area a lighter shade of red. It was also transparent and he could easily see trees and bushes through the ray field. A short while later, the ray field began to slowly disappear — but from the top down to the ground. After the ray field disappeared, the ground still \"glimmered\" for another ten seconds or so. About 20 to 30 seconds later, the object accelerated back into the sky and disappeared. Throughout this time, Jurgen was unable to contact his CB partners, with only hum-like sounds coming from his radio. Jurgen estimated the sighting lasted about ten minutes altogether. The ray field built up in five to ten seconds, existed for one to two minutes and then began disappearing, taking seven to eight minutes before it was completely gone. Jurgen heard no sound from the object and GEP could find no other witnesses. In a report to MUFON, Hans-Werner Peiniger of GEP said the investigators believe the youth was telling the truth and they have concluded the sighting is authentic. GEP's investigation indicated the object was about 68 meters above the ground and that there was a cloud layer at an altitude of about 200 to 300 meters. The object itself was round with a flattish bottom. Its size was estimated to be 10 to 15 meters in diameter."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"UFO SEDUCTION CASE IN BRAZIL By A. J. GEVAERD MUFON Representative in Brazil The Jardim Alvorada Affair is the study of a UFO abduction involving sexual relations and dialogue with the crew of a UFO. It is an unusual case because of its ( strangeness. It occurred in 1979, a relatively poor year for UFOs in Brazil. This case will show us much more than we already know about UFO abductions. Rarely does a UFO abduction show sexual relations between the witness and the extraterrestrial. This case has some resemblance to the Villas-Boas case, which also occurred in Brazil about 20 years ago. But the Jardim Alvorada Affair is far more interesting and shows us not only the episode of sexual relations but also points out 'the interest of the alien group in our development in genetic reproduction. The crew of the craft introduced themselves as a kind of \"team for research and study of Earth and human civilizations,\" something that they called \"Unity Agripo.\" The case was investigated by CPDV, or the Center for Flying Saucer Research, although at the time of the investigation the group was called OPETOVNI, or the UFO Theoretical Studies and Research Organization, composed of 30 to 40 members. The investigation included a number of interviews with the two main witnesses, who are brothers, and ten hypnotic regression sessions, which were carried out by Dr. Oswaldo Alves, an MD. Although there were no other witnesses to the abduction, there were a number of other people who saw the UFO in the vicinity and one couple took three photos of it with a Nikon camera, the photos showing a bright spherical object crossing the sky inside some clouds and in front of the moon. The incident occurred on the night of April 13,1979, in Jardim Alvorada, a suburb of the city of Maringa in the state of Parana in southern Brazil. The principal witnesses are Jocelino de Mattos, then 21 arid an electrician or linesman, and his brother, Roberto Carlos, then 13. The incident began about 11:30 PM and continued until about 1:30 AM. The brothers had gone to a sister's house to watch a religious program on TV (April 13 being a religious date in Brazil), but because the ceremony was not going to,begin until about midnight, they decided to go home. Consistent In every interview, the brothers' stories were consistent, changing only when occasional new bits of informa- tion were dredged up. Here is Jocelino's narrative as told to us in our first interview with him: \"My brother drew my attention to a strange star. He was astonished by its presence and I said to him it was only a star and he need not be afraid of it. As we continued walking down the stree, the star looked as if it was following us, and it astonished me too. \"When we arrived at the corner where we normally turn right to go home, we felt a strange sensation. My A. J. GEVAERD MUFON Representative for western Brazil blood started to run wildly in my veins and I began to get nervous. I don't know why, but-we'began to walk towards a tree in the rhiddle of a plowed field. I didn't want to: ; go in that direction but something compelled me and my brother to walk towards it. It was difficult' for us to walk because it was plowed and already prepared for •planting. . .'•'  . • ,• . . \"When we were immediately below the big tree, we both fell down to the ground! The-strange object was about 10 to 15 meters away from us and about two or three meters, above the , ground. It was floating silently, and that's a|l I can remember except that I heard a kind of voice that said something like, The job is not ended, we will be back.' I do not know how I heard that voice but I remember it as in a dream. . \"Some time later .we woke up with difficulty. Neither of us could walk by ourselves and.I helped my brother up and he helped me up. We held each other and walked towards our house. We took a long time to reach the house. It seemed so far. We were dirty with mud and I was feeling a strange and sudden hunger. I've never left like that before. \"Our legs were so weak. We were trembling. Some minutes later we reached home and as we were about to open the door our legs became weaker and we fell down suddenly, breaking the door open. \"My mother and brothers were waiting for us. They ran towards us and helped us up. We explained to them what had happened. At first they doubted us but later they went outside with me and I pointed out the star, which was still there. \"As we stood looking at the star, silently hovering almost over the trees, about 300 to 350 meters away from us, I (continued on next page) 8"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"began to tell my family what had happened to me and my brother. \"When I started telling them this, the object seemed to observe us from that distance and suddenly my brother and I received some kind of a shock, so strong it hurled us to the ground. \"My mother, another brother and my sister were not touched. My mother told me later that when they touched me or Roberto, we felt electrified, or something like that. We did not feel electrified, but we couldn't move even a finger. \"Then the star went away and we could stand again.\" Some time later, after a number of interviews, Jocelino agreed to undergo hypnotic regression. All the hypnotic regression sessions were tape recorded, and the transcriptions now make ,up part of a book (not yet published) called The Jardim Alvorada Affair - The Cosmic Connection, by A. J. Gevaerd. The following is part of the transcription from the second hypnotic session with Jocelino. Although he sometimes refers to himself and his brother as being in the craft, only Jocelino entered it. \"...the moment we turned the corner, something started pulling, us, attracting us to the star. We fought against it, but couldn't. Suddenly, we started to walk, and walk... It seemed as if we were walking very slowly and then we were walking very fast. \"My heartbeat started to Photos taken in sequence (left to right) night of April 13,1979, with object passing moon and clouds as shown below MOON BEHIND CLOUDS accelerate, rapidly. I felt my body chilling, something bad. It was the same with my legs, in all my body, a bad sensation. Floating \"We continued walking. It seemed that it was impossible for us to think of anything else. The only objective was to reach the place where the star was. When we arrived, we fell down to the ground. We stayed in that position for about two minutes, and after this time somebody came and caught us and took us up to a height. We were taken floating to that height. \"I was astonished to see something so incredible in front of me. Then a door was opened, at the side, and I went in. Then there were two men in the doorway. One of them came in front of me and looked at me very attentively. \"He took up an object which I didn't recognize, touched the object to my left arm, and gestured to me to get inside. From that point, we walked a little bit and we arrived in another room full of computers and there was some kind of command display on a table. It had different lights that I did not recognize and cannot explain. \"After that, they took me to another room full of motors, things I had never seen before! They were not hot and there was no noise. The motors were conic or something like that. \"Then they took me to another room where there were some photographs similar to those of earth. I could see that the photographs were fixed on the wall in a kind of video-tape, a TV screen or something like that. I could not distinguish it very well. \"Then we arrived in another room full of equipment like hospital equipment. It was a medical room. They asked me to lie down and as I did so, they examined me. Then, after this examination, they collected sperm, a small amount. (Note: Later sessions indicated this was done by inserting a tube into his' penis, with the sample being collected in a plastic package similar to cellophane.) \"Then they made me sit down on a kind of table. They put some instruments in my head and they spoke among themselves in a language that I did not understand. \"Then...(Jocelino stopped for (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"1979 FONTAINE CASE IN FRANCE NOW ADMITTED TO BE A HOAX The following is reprinted from the English summary of the October 1983 SVL (Belgium's Studiegroep voor Vreemde Luchtuerschijnselen) Journal, edited by Wim Van Utrecht. By JACQUES BONABOT On November 26, 1979, at Cergy- Pontoise, France, not far from Paris, three young peddlers, Frank,Fontaine, Jean-Pierre Prevost and Salomon N'Daye, created a sensation in the French press with their claim of a close encounter during which Fontaine was abducted by \"extraterrestrials\" and released one week later. Many doubted the authenticity of this abduction. The gendarmarie showed little interest and GEPAN (Groupe d'Etude des Phenomenes Aerospatiaux Non-identifies, the official French government agency studying the UFO phenomenon) discovered obvious contradictions. Several French researchers mentioned their doubts about the affair, but all this could not prevent the story's being published on the other side of the Atlantic in American magazines. As far as we were concerned, we published a simple narration of the facts in the GESAG Journal of March 1980 under the title \"De Zaak Fontaine\" (The Fontaine Case). It was Jimmy Guieu, founder of the \"Institute for Advanced Studies,\" science^fiction writer and author of two books on the UFO phenomenon, who gave unwarranted attention to the three heroes in his book Contact Cergy-Pontoise. By means of a local radio in Brest and afterwards in the newspaper Le Parisien of July 7, 1983, one of the witnesses, Jean-Pierre Prevost — who had not ceased drawing attention to the affair since November 1979 by clairning he was in contact with the extraterrestrials, and more precisaly with \"Haurrio,\" whom he said he encountered. in January 1980 — .confessed. \"I confirm that the Cergy affair was a hoax from the beginning to the end,\" he said. \"I am the only one to be held responsible. I organized and put together the whole story. I can prove it.\" And the proof he gave consisted of a very easily verifiable comment: \"Frank Fontaine had spent the eight days of his 'disappearance' in the apartment of a friend of Pontoise. I took him there and also brought him back.\" Prevost confirmed that he likes to have a laugh and added: \"How can one imagine extraterrestrials coming to abduct a buffoon?\" By why then this set-up? The \"prime witness\" explains: \"By inventing this story I got a public. It was a way of setting people together and to pass on to them my message...\" For Jean-Pierre Prevoist wanted to introduce a new way of living: \"Knowing that people are not interested any more in traditional religions and that they need some support, I thought of extraterrestrial beings...\" Since the Cergy affair, he had indeed tried to establish various sects but always in vain. Nevertheless, Prevost does not explain why he waited carefully for four years before he admitted the hoax. One should know that after three years there is proscription of what is called \"outrage a magistrat\" (the statute of limitations had run out? — Ed.) The newspaper Quesf France printed a similar account and added that \"Frank Fontaine, hero and victim of the event, has been in prison since the summer of 1982 because he committed several robberies.\" Gevaerd, continued some minutes and the hypnotist tried to make him less concerned)...but it scares me so much....After some minutes a woman arrived in the room. She touched me. She caressed me and it excited me. Then we started to make love. \"After (the relations), she stopped and told me: 'Perhaps the seed will come alive.' I did not understand anything. \"She went out of the room and they spoke between themselves and 10 they told me in thought (telepathically) that they were for peace and that their objective was to study, to understand, the earth. They spoke to me about life, the fights and the wars and I really thought they were for peace, that they were peaceful people, friends. \"Then they told me: 'We think it's time to leave you.' They took me by my arm and we went the same way we had walked to get to that place until we arrived at the door. I jumped to the ground together with them and they went floating ahead to where they could catch me. I felt myself paralyzed, totally unable to move. \"They made me lie down on the ground , exactly the way I was before they caught me. Then I came to my senses.\" *** Jocelino and Roberto have for a long time been ashamed to live among their friends and family. They live silently, talk little and don't participate in communal life. When we first talked to them, almost a year after the incident, Jocelino was still disturbed and looking for help."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"UFO TECH NOTE: Voice Stress Analysis By JOHN SCHUESSLER Copyright© 1984 by John Schuessler UFO investigators are generally sincere, dedicated volunteers who spend countless hours and dollars in their quest for answers in this complex field. Periodically, they waste a lot of their effort because of deliberate fabrication on the part of witness. This may be because the witness wants to enlarge upon the story, wants publicity, or just wants to try and fool the expert. On the other hand, there has been an increase in attempts by professional charlatans to use their tools of deceit to intimidate witnesses and investigators alike. Some investigators have gotten out of the field because they do not like to associate with such characters. Others continue to waste their time and money on such fraudulent activities because they are too dedicated to give up. Still others are considering legal action, a long and expensive process, to even the score. But, there is another answer — the use of electronic analytical methods. One such method is Voice Stress Analysis. The Voice Stress Analyzer has been likened to a lie detector without wires. Adherents claim it is considerably more accurate than the lie detector, while critics claim the opposite. This Tech Note will not try to resolve that issue. The specific objective of the Voice Stress Analyzer is to use the human voice as a medium of detecting and evaluating psychological stress, thereby eliminating the wires and attachments of the lie detector that are often a contributor to stress in the witness. Therapists specializing in stress detection and reduction recognize the relationship between the psychological state and they physiological response and work on the psychological state to reduce the stress. It is a treatment that works. The human voice is affected by stress, both on the conscious and the unconscious level. The muscles controlling the membranes of the vocal cords are working muscles, subject to a phenomenon known as physiological tremor. This is a minute, sub-audible oscillation which corresponds in frequency and nature to Alpha traces in brainwave patterns. These tremors cause the muscles to constrict at an uncontrollable rate. According to the literature on Voice Stress Analyzers, the change occurs at the rate of the physiological tremor and corresponds to the amplitude of movement caused by the tremor. This causes frequency modulation of the voice fundamental at the frequency of the physiological tremor and thereby creates the sub-audible changes in voice. The amplitude of the tremor is directly related to stress. A non- stressed person has minimal tremors; but as he stresses, the tremors increase. Therefore, superimposed on the audible voice frequencies are inaudible frequency modulations whose strength and pattern relate to the degree of psychological stress. Certain functions of the body must function on an automatic, self- regulating basis, operating below the threshold of awareness. Some examples are breathing, beating of the heart and other life-supporting processes. These bodily functions are controlled by the Autonomic Nervous System. Since the voice is operated by muscles under the control of the Autonomic Nervous System, the speaker cannot control the minute, sub-audible changes that occur in his voice. He can neither cause them nor suppress them by voluntary action; however, the Voice Stress Analyzer can detect them. Use of the Voice Stress Analyzer should not be taken lightly. Before conducting a test, the investigator should collect all available data, study that data, and formulate a set of test questions. The test subject should be in a nominal state, free from pain, hunger, fatigue, wild emotional swings, and not under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Questions should be formulated in a way to permit the Sympathetic Nervous System to react to relevant questions that indicate chicanery. Irrelevant questions can then be structured in a way to permit the Parasympathetic Nervous System to null out the reaction and'return the body to a baseline state. This can be accomplished by use of control questions and outside issues. The user of the Voice Stress Analyzer has a responsibility to be, properly trained by the manufacturer of the device and then to use the device in a proper way. A .person has a right to know if someone is lying to him, especially if he is to invest his time, money and reputation on an activity with that person; but that does not give license to operate in an unethical manner. As a word of caution, some states do not permit the use of lie-detectors, voice stress analyzers, or other devices. State laws should be checked before utilizing any of these devices in an investigation. What should an investigator do if a subject is found to be lying? One answer might be to reconvene on another day and repeat the testing, utilizing a new set of questions. A review of the case data should be conducted to see if it matches the results of the testing. If the investigator is convinced the subject is lying, then he should close the case and apply his resources to some other case. Even then, he should be courteous, but firm, and permit the subject a face-saving exit. As responsib- le investigators we should be interested in the data and refrain from playing games with liars. We cannot solve their problems. 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"THE CLOSE ENCOUNTER THAT WASN'T By Stan Gordon Slate Director for Pennsylvania When one is involved in conducting research into any phenomena, it is essential to investigate these cases on a direct basis with those who took part in the actual occurrence. Many times second hand information can be totally false or be a distortion of what actually occurred. An example of this was a UFO incident reported on October 21,1983, near Rpckwood, Pennsylvania. We had been contacted a few days after the occurrence by a close relative of the two eyewitness, who wanted to make us aware of the incident. . .Mr. and Mrs. Parker*, the two observers, had been renting a cabin in the scenic area where ,the incident occurred, but had returned to their home in Florida shortly afterwards. The relative went on to explain that the couple had heard a loud, high-pitched sound at approximately 3 PM on the day of the occurrence. When they went outside to see what was causing the noise, they observed a large round object in the sky that was dropping some type of material from it. The relative gave me the address arid phone number of Mr. Parker in Florida, but it would be a short time till I would be able to contact him. Within a few hours after this initial phone call, our PASU UFO Hotline began to receive other calls from individuals who had heard of this incident as well. Further details revealed that the UFO allegedly hovered low over the cabin, then descended into the woods and landed a short distance from the witnesses. At this point an occupant from the craft was reported to have emerged. According to these informants, the Parkers then notified the state police of the incident. This story was, of course, of interest to us, but the Parkers had to be contacted before we could begin an evaluation of the case. In the meantime, we contacted the state police, who verified that a trooper 12 had been sent to investigate an incident involving an unusual substance falling from the sky, but there had been no mention of a UFO involvement. A short time later we were able to make contact with Mr. Parker'and obtained the first hand details. Parker explained that he and his wife were watching TV when at about 3 PM they heard a loud sound which gave them •the impression that several aircraft were flying together over the area. They went outside to look, but no aircraft >were in sight. They did, however, observe a strange doriut- shaped object that was a bright pink color that was motionless. The object appeared to be approximately 39 feet in diameter, with the ring section appearing to be about 9 feet in thickness. They could look up into the center, of the donut-shaped structure and could see the cloudy sky above. After about a minute, the circle of pink began to dissipate. The sound which , had been prevalent during the observation seemed to stop at the same time that the circle faded away. About 20 minutes after the sighting, Mr. Parker went outside and noticed small particles of bright orange color on his porch, as well as over the trees in the surrounding area. It was soon discovered that the substance had also fallen in areas about half a mile ; northwest and southeast of this location. The material was not present prior to the sighting of the unusual donut-shaped ring. Mr. Parker, thinking that this material could be of some type of hazard, then notified the state police. A trooper arrived at the scene, took some samples of the flourescent orange' material, and then notified the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources, who arrived at the scene a few days after the actual event. They, as well as our PASU unit, obtained samples of the residue for laboratory analysis. After hearing the details of the (continued on next page) STAN GORDON.

PASU, in trying to track down the source for the observation, made contact with numerous agencies, some of which included the U.S. Air Force, The U.S. Geological Survey, The Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Forestry Service, Civil Air Patrol and The Pennsylvania Game Commission. None of these sources could give us a lead as to why this substance would be used. After several weeks of searching, we believe that we have identified the substance. It is called Dayglow, a water- soluable material that is a bright orange color. According to our informant, Dayglow is used by aerial spraying contractors, who use this substance to determine the actual' spray pattern • emitting from the aircraft. . The unusual ring seems related to this emission from the aircraft. It seems likely that some type of spraying operation was taking place over the Rockwood area. *** *Pseudonym for the name o/ the actual witness, which is on file with MUFON Headquarters. *** • Correspondence may be sent to (PASU), Pennsylvania Association For The Study Of The Unexplained, 6 OakhillAvenue, Greensburg, Pa. 15601.

Nelson Villa Park, Calif. 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"SOME HIGHLIGHTS IN AUSTRALIAN UFOLOGY By PAUL NORMAN Copyright© 1983 by Paul Norman Official Australian investigation of unusual aerial phenomena was in progress even before the foo fighter era of World War II. As far back as 1930, a squadron-leader was sent by the Australian Air Force to Warrnambool, Victoria, a town west of the Otway Ranges, on the north shore of Bass Strait, where people had reported \"aircraft\" flying over the coast. The official investigator found that the objects were not aircraft belonging to Australia or any other power. They could not be identified even as aircraft. In short, they were unknown objects. After retirement, the investigating officer became a highly regarded member of the Victorian UFO Research Society (VUFORS). He was Sir George Jones, the former Air Marshall of the Royal Australian Air Force, during World War II. Note that this first documented official investigation of unidentified flying objects took place on the shores of Bass Strait, which has become the outstanding \"flap area\" of Australia, where strange sights in the sky and over its waters reach back for two centuries and beyond. During October 1978, UFO activity reached an all time peak, consummating with the greatest mystery in Australian aviation history, the Frederick Valentich Case in which the young aviator disappeared in an encounter with a UFO. *** Within a seven-day period in June 1954, an object described as cylinder or cigar shaped was reported over the suburbs of Melbourne. One witness said her wristwatch stopped at 6:23 PM and the batteries in her small flashlight went dead while the object — about 30 feet long by 15 feet high — was nearby. At close range, a canopy with a window on top could be seen. There was a window at each end of the silver colored cylinder as it rose above a house and sped away. Witnesses in the Melbourne suburb of Maldon said \"dark shapes\" could ' be seen within the craft. A policeman reported the object hovered near the ground near where he was standing and he could see shadows of people inside before it sped away. A radio announcer, who sighted the object from another suburb of Melbourne, said he was saying goodby to friends when he heard a sound like a dial tone of a phone. \"It travelled at a fantastic speed, yet it appeared to be moving slowly, as if time and speed had become distorted.\" When it reached its lowest point, shapes like human forms could be seen. He said, \"We were too amazed to talk for several seconds, we were so impressed that each of us wrote down our individual impression and they tallied almost exactly.\" The object was last seen travelling toward Bass Strait. *** The newspaper SUN displayed this front page headline on December 16,1954: NAVY FINDS SAUCERS ON OUR RADAR. The encounter was an outstanding radar/visual case. The incident had occurred three months prior, in September, but the story did not become known to the press until December. A Navy fighter was flying to Australia's Navy Base at Nowra just after dark when two disc-shaped objects took up positions, one on each side of the aircraft. The pilot requested a radar check, which was done. Three blips showed up on the radar screen. Nowra directed the pilot to execute certain movements to identify himself from the two objects. The UFOs gradually drew away and vanished. All the movements were confirmed on the radar screen. *** One of the best sightings to come from the Tasmanian side of Bass Strait occurred in October 1960. An object was sighted by Anglican Minister, the Rev. Lional Browning, and his wife, of Cressy, a small town near Lonceston. They observed a grey cigar-shaped object with vertical bands on the side and a \"rod\" projected from one end, which might have been an antenna. Rev. Browning had been skeptical about \"flying saucer\" reports but stated it was no normal aircraft because it was descending below stalling speed. After about a minute the \"ship\" stopped and hovered for about 30 seconds, at which time five \"saucers\" swooped out of the clouds as if joining a mother ship. He estimated they were at that time about three miles away. He described them as being flat on the bottom, with domes on top. *** On February 15, 1963, a disc- shaped object with a transparent dome descended to a low level near a milking shed at Willow Grove, near Moe, Victoria. The main body of the object was described as battleship gray. The UFO hovered a few seconds before flying away. During that time the cattle panicked to the extent they could not be milked. For a period of many weeks the cattle avoided the spot over which the UFO had hovered. Charles Brew was the only witness to the sighting, although his son Trevor, inside the shed, heard the swishing sound made by the object. Although, the sighting was of short duration, VUFORS investigators made the 90-mile trip from Melbourne and , found that official investigators had already been there. The witness developed a headache, which he rarely ever had but did not realize the pain was associated with the close encounter until an official inestigator had questioned him.

(See No. 145, March 1980). Ron Sullivan, of Maryborough, Victoria, saw an object rising from the ground. As he drew near, he could see it was disc shaped with beams of light in every color of the rainbow. Suddenly his headlight beams were drawn in the direction of the object and \"bent\" in a V shape back toward the road. The case was investigated by VUFORS and the Victorian Police. The UFO had left a depression in the freshly plowed ground. There were no tracks leading to the spot were the depression was made. A few days after the incident, a motorist phoned VUFORS that he had been approaching from the opposite direction and saw the object in the paddock but had fled but he was concerned that he had not reported the incident to the police for fear of the violation. Twelve years later, VUFORS found further confirmation that a UFO was indeed at the same location were Gary Taylor had crashed into a tree opposite the depressed spot in the field. Another driver who had been following some distance behind the victim also saw the lights from the object. He reported that he thought the lights had blinded the youth who crashed. The encounter occurred during a major flap in Victoria. Just prior to the death at Bourks Flat, a science teacher at Westhall High School, together with scores of students, watched a silver- colored object rise out of a paddock near the school and soar into the sky, leaving the grass depressed in an oblong football shape. The incident was investigated by VUFORS including interviews with witnesses. Later, military vehicles were seen in the paddock and men examining the depressed spot. After which the field was burned off. *** Other restrictions regarding information on UFO encouncers are evident. For example, a UFO was filmed by the captain of an airliner while on a flight to Port Morsby in New Guinea. The captain reported the incident to Townsville control. He was instructed not to have the film developed until he returned to Australia. Upon his return, two officials were on hand to take the film. *** Australia has its share of UFO encounters involving aircraft. On August 22, 1968, UFOs sighted from a Murchison Air Services charter flight were reported by Captain Gordon Smith and Captain Walter Gardin. They were flying from Adelaide to Perth. The pilots were interviewed by a psychologist, who sent Captain Smith's personal report to VUFORS. An object was first seen by Captain Gardin. He immediately aroused Captain Smith, who was asleep. The time was shortly after 7:30 PM. The two pilots observed the large object open MUFON Amateur Radio Net Joe Santangelo (N1JS), manager of the MUFON Amateur Radio Net and Regional Director, has submitted his annual activity report for 1983. Twenty- five different stations participated by checking-in each Saturday morning at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time on 7237 KHz in the forty meter band.

Joe also took advantage of his computer and word processor to compile his annual report. up, at which time smaller objects flew out of the main object and continued to maneuver with the larger UFO. At the time this operation was in progress radio communication failed. Communication was restored after the objects flew away. The objects were last seen after they joined again \"as if at a single command\" before speeding away. *** In Victoria, an interesting buildup of UFO activity began in September 1977 along the Murray River, near Leitchville. This flap reached a peak in December. The UFOs were not only demonstrating their mysterious activity in the sky, they were landing in the paddocks and leaving physical traces on the ground. VUFORS investigators spent a total of 30 days within a three- month period interviewing witnesses and compiling reports, some of which are still to be published. One of the more spectacular sightings began on the night of Decmeber 13, witnessed by 12 observers who climbed to the top of a milking shed to watch the display. A large UFO was first seen by Mr. and Mrs. Tom Church at a low altitude descending at about the landing speed of an aircraft. After it hovered, three objects were seen flying from the main object within three minutes. One of the smaller UFOs flew 25 miles within two minutes before it took up its position between the witnesses and Pyramid Hill. Within five minutes two other objects flew from the parent object and took up positions between the large UFO and Pyramid Hill. During the course of four hours, the witnesses saw what they thought were meteorites falling to the ground. All of the \"meteorites\" fell within the 25- mile zone as if they were being drawn into the zone by a magnetic force. About one in every three \"meteorites\" curved up before burning out. They fell at about the rate of 15 per hour. After four hours all witnesses were asleep.

Klass continues to insist that so-called \"fireball\" meteors can last for minutes, and thus Jenny Zeidman is wrong in concluding that the UFO in the October 18, 1973, Ohio helicopter case 2 could not have been a meteor because the sighting , lasted several minutes. In support of his contention, he sent me copies of five \"meteor\" reports in which the phenomena were observed for 1 to 18,or more minutes. Mr ; Klass annotated his paper to the effect that Jenny Zeidman says \"...a meteor-fireball, under the most favorable conditions, could not be visible for more than 30-40 seconds.\" The enclosed cases were intended to refute this \"naive\" contention, and were \"DEDICATED to Richard Hall, who accepts the 'Zeidman Limits' as 'Gospel'.\"i In my book review, I had endorsed Zeidman's statement. The endorsement, however, was based on well-established facts of/observational astronomy, not oh faith. I repeat here my (unanswered) challenge to Mr. Klass to have, the current president of the American Meteor Society review Zeidman's report on the Ohio case and offer an independent opinion on the fireball hypothesis. A brief review of the cases which supposedly establish the reality of long- lasting fireballs instead, amusingly, establishes the reality of some very strange aerial phenomena, not one of which could conceivably have been a meteor. Case 1. On November 20,1902, in Australia, a slow-moving \"fire ball\" was observed for four minutes by an astronomer at the Adelaide Observatory. No details of the observa- tion are given. (Source: Charles Fort, based, on Australian newspaper reports). 16 Case 2. The U.S.S. Supply case of By RICHARD HALL Feb. 28,1904, which has been reported in many standard references. The three \"meteors\" are reported.to have moved in \"echelon\" formation, first southeasterly below the clouds, then turning and climbing up through the clouds, and disappearing to the west northwest. The angular size of the lead object is given as \"...an apparent area of about six suns\" (i.e., about 3° of ;arc), the second \"meteor\" about 1° of arc, and the third about l / 2 °. The sighting lasted, \"over...two minutes.\" The reporter, later to become a prominent Navy Admiral; noted: \"The near approach of these meteors to the surface and the subsequent flight away from the surface appear to be most remarkable.\" (Source: Monthly Weather Review, March 1904:) Case 3. On July 8, 1868, at the Radcliff Observatory in Oxford, England, a motionless cloud-like phenomenon \"about 5° in length and 1° in breadth\" (i.e., about 10 times the apparent size of the sun or moon in longest dimension) was observed near Polaris, the North Star. It appeared comet-like. Then \"...it appeared to start into motion, taking a course directly west.. .leaving a train behind of a greater breadth than itself...[and] disappeared below the N.W. horizon.\" At one point it turned south, then, turned north again, remaining visible for \"nearly four minutes.\" (Source: English Mechanic, July 10, 1868). Case 4. On February 5,1883, near Arvika, Sweden, \"...a meteor of unusual size and appearance was observed....\" It first moved from southeast to northwest, then after about 18 seconds reversed course and headed back southeast. (A very remarkable meteor!) \"During its progress to north-west... the meteor made several digressions from its plane....At the point of changing its direction, when it was so near the surface of the lake that its path was reflected, therein, it possessed a distinct tail....\" It finally disappeared to the southeast after \"nearly fifty seconds.\" (Source: Nature, March 1, 1883.) Case 5. Oh August 1, 1871, at Marseilles, France, a '\"remarkable meteorite\" [sic] was observed to move slowly across the sky, its course carefully plotted against the star background. It moved in an easterly direction for about 10 minutes,\" ... remained for a moment stationary, then, changing its course took a northerly direction...[then] to the west, and again stopping....\" Another course change to east, another stop, then a rapid perpendicular fall toward the horizon, during which \"...it gave out [bjrilliant scintillations.\" Sighting duration 'was close to 20 minutes. The apparent size was at first about half that of the sun or moon. (Source: Nature, Oct. 5, 1871.) This article is dedicated to Phil Klass, who accepts that meteors of gigantic proportions can silently maneuver through our skies, hover, change course, and otherwise defy conventional knowledge. Dr. Bruce S. Maccabee has stated elsewhere, ajso in response to Klass, the principle that conventional phenomena advanced as explanations for UFO : reports must .obey conventional physics. These \"meteors\" obviously fail the test. It is 'also noteworthy that the five cases all date to the late 19th and very, early 2Qth century, and that Mr. Klass apparently was unable to cite any modern cases based on instrumented data — or even anecdotal data from experienced meteor observers — to support his strange contention. In fact, it is an untenable position and I once more call upon him to retract the, meteor hypothesis for the Ohio helicopter case. NOTES 1. The arc of the sky from horizon to horizon covers 180° or half of' a complete cirlce. Phenomena observed against the sky background may be measured (angular size) by how many degrees of arc they fill (\"subtend\"). Both the sun and moon subtend approximately '/2°. It would take 360 suns or moons placed rim to rim to reach across the sky from horizon to horizon. Objects or phenomena of the reported apparent size in these cases would be up to 6-10 times the angular size of the sun or moon! 2. A Helicopter-UFO Encounter Over Ohio, Center for UFO Studies, P.O.

The Fund for UFO Research is considering setting up a computer oriented quick response UFO report \"hotline\" system. They have invited people who have equipment for communicating by telephone with a distant computer to adivse them of the type of equipment that they possess. The minimum requirement for this would be a so-called \"dumb\" terminal. Other types of equipment include a typical home computer, plus a modem, plus a display. An information storage capability (tape, disc) and a hard copy device (printer) would be helpful. The Fund is seeking people who have equipment that is no longer needed to donate as a tax deductible gift. They would cover the costs of shipment of any equipment that they accept. Dr. Bruce Maccabee has contacted MUFON to determine our computer capabilities so as to be a part of the \"hotline.\" We must sadly admit that our headquarters office is not so equipped or has the funds to purchase equipment at the present time. Dr. Richard F. Haines, Director of the North American UFO Federation has also proposed the development of a network for the interchange of UFO related information between researchers with micro-computers. The large number of UFO researchers possessing the necessary equipment makes such a development a reasonable goal for the near future. He is also proposing that a study committee be established within the NAUFOF for the standardization of computers within the field of Ufology. Dr. Haines has submitted the following list of equipment required and suggested manufacturers: (1) A computer such as the Apple II, TRS80, IBM-PC, Exidy Sorcerer, Osborne, Epson, Hewlett-Packard, Commodore 64, using a program that permits the computer to communicate over an RS-232 interface with other computers within the same \"network.\" (2) A Coupler or Modem: (either direct or acoustic type) which connects the computer to the commercial telephone line. (3) Some preliminary working standards: In order for two computers to communicate with each other via the telephone, both must agree in advance upon the data transfer rate (called the \"baud\" rate. . .for bits per second. Dr. Haines has recommended 1200.) Full-duplex is also recommended, if one does not need to see on his or her CRT screen what is being typed or being sent out to the other computer. Otherwise use half-duplex. This will provide the user with a duplicate of what is being transmitted on one's own video display. Like the Fund for UFO Research, Dick Haines is requesting information on potential users to ascertain the feasibility of setting up a computer network within Ufology. It is necessary to know how many computers and peripheral equipment now exists. Another proposal has been received from Michael D. Hart, a MUFON member in Seattle, Washington, to establish what he has elected to call \"The COMPUFON Information Network\" (Computerized Unidentified Flying Object Network). Mr. Hart, in his correspondence, is advising that he will be initiating a new service on a continent-wide basis to gather information relating to UFO activity. He is an online member of the CompuServe Computer Network and thus has access to two mainframe computer systems which have vast storage capabilities. He will be gathering information that is sent to him on a weekly basis and compiling it into an information recap. This recap will be mailed to all members of COMPUFON, PSAPR, and any organization that would like access to such information. He hopes to establish a nationwide network of reporting stations. Michael's proposal is in its infancy; however I have brought it to your attention to give MUFON members another idea of how computers may be used in Ufology. We have been accumulating a file on computers, peripherals, manufacturers, models and prices in preparation for the day when the Mutual UFO Network can purchase appropriate equipment to become an integral part of a telephone-connected UFO communication system. A thorough evaluation of the equipment available and the cost to provide the essential services in the MUFON headquarters office is presently underway. However funds are not available in our budget to make such a purchase. After determining exactly what functions and processes we will expect the computer to perform, using available software programs, and the necessary peripherals, a manufacturer and model will be identified. Knowing exactly what will be expected of the computer, hardware and software, a unit may be purchased in the most feasible price range to fulfill the intended purpose. As funds become available, MUFON will purchase one piece of equipment at a time until the planned goal is reached. As suggested by Dr. Bruce Maccabee, MUFON would be very receptive to donations of compatible computer components as a means of establishing a UFO hotline, word processor, UFO case file, etc. At this time, we are setting up a special bank account for the purpose of receiving tax-exempt, donations and gifts to be earmarked specifically for the purchase of a computer. As one of the largest UFO organizations in the nation, it behooves MUFON to maintain its position of excellence by joining the world of computers to better serve Ufology. . 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"BRIGHT PLANETS IN 1984 (Constellation locations of planets at mid-month and evening/morning visibility.

Another valuable addition to our team from Brazil is Cynthia Newby Luce, who has an M.A. in Experimental Psychology and resides in Sao Jose do Rio Preto. Having lived in Brazil for many.years as a U.S. citizen, Cynthia is bilingual in Portuguese and English, which will make her ideal for translating UFO sighting reports and investiga- tions originating in Brazil. Cynthia was recommended by Mrs. Cynthia Hind, Continental Coordinator for Africa, and served as her translator when Mrs. Hind delivered a paper at the April 1983 Second International UFO Congress of Brasilia, Brazil. Both Cynthia Newby Luce and Mrs. Cynthia Hind will be attending the MUFON 1984 UFO Symposium in San Antonio, Texas this July. *** On January 28, 1984, MUFON of Southern California sponsored a UFO 18 Seminar at the Civic Auditorium of Veterans Memorial Building in Culver City, California, featuring Stanton F. Friedman, William L. Moore and David Froning. Jean Waller, State Director for Oklahoma, conducted, a Field Investigator's Training Meeting in Norman, Oklahoma, on Saturday, February 18, 1984. Ken McLean has .announced that the P.R.O.-U.F.S.s Contactee Summer Conference will be held June 14 to 18, 1984, at the University of Wyoming in Laramie. This particular weekend was selected so there would not be a conflict with the dates for the MUFON 1984 UFO Symposium. *** Jim Leming, Acting State Director for Montana, has suggested that the upcoming release of the book Clear Intent by Larry Fawcett and Barry J. Greenwood (Prentice-Hall) would be an ideal time to promote the book and MUFON in a cooperative program at the book stores in each of our localities. It has been proposed that MUFON provide literature that can be handed out by pur people and answer questions, about the organization to interested people. This will require obtaining permission from the individual book store owners or managers prior to the April or May 1984 release date and advising MUFON the quantity of brochures needed. It is essential that a representative of MUFON is present to distribute the brochures and answer questions if the cooperative program is' to be effective. An alternative, to decrease shipping costs, would be to provide a master copy of the brochure and have it printed in each person's locality. Please give this proposal serious consideration since timing if of the essence. ' MUFON has received a few donations from members to be applied to financing the North American UFO Federation with suggestions that/the individual members not be assessed but to rely on donations to this worthwhile cause for unity in Ufology."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Lucius Parish In Others' Words A summary of the \"crash/ retrieval\" cases investigated by Leonard H. Stringfield is the subject of the \"Anti-Matter/UFO Update\" column in the January issue of OMNI. Writer Casey McCabe gives a brief, but fair, review of the evidence for such events. The January/February issue of SATURDAY EVENING POST has the first installment of a two-part article by Donald A. White, \"Flying Saucers: Are They Us?\" As the title suggests, White emphasizes the theory that UFOs are time travellers, returning to their past (our present) from the future. While no possibility can be ruled out, some of White's reasons for rejecting other theories of UFO origin appear to be based on faulty reasoning. Dr. Bruce Maccabee contributes an interesting and much-needed article to the February issue of FATE. In Part I of his presentation, Maccabee asks if there are any \"TRUFO\" (TRue UFO) sightings which remain unexplained and which cannot be placed in the \"Insufficient Information\" category. He then gives good examples of just such cases. The concluding part of the article will be in the March issue of FATE, with additional contributions slated for later issues. The Aquarian Press of Great Britain, in conjunction with ASSAP (Association for the Scientific Study of Anomalous Phenomena), is publishing a series of titles on various types of unexplained phenomena. The first of these, THE EVIDENCE FOR UFOs by Hilary Evans, is now available. It is an overview of the UFO subject which the beginner would find quite useful and which older hands might also wish to review. All the basics — photographic evidence, visual and radar evidence, medical effects, abduction cases, UFO occupants, \"Men In Black,\" the governmental view, paranormal phenomena, etc. — are summarized in seven chapters, with the eighth chapter being devoted to Evans' personal assessment of the subject. He believes there are at least four sources of UFO reports; psychological in nature, biological objects which manifest as balls of light, secret governmental devices, and \"structured artefacts of extraterrestrial origin.\" The book has several photos and illustrations, as well as a bibliography/ reading list and an index. A nicely-done paperback, it can be obtained from UFO NEWSCL1PP1NG SERVICE The UFONEWSCLIPPING SERVICE will keep you informed of all the latest United States and World-Wide UFO activity, as it happens! Our service was started in 1969, at which time we contracted with a reputable international newspaper-clipping bureau to obtain for us, those hard to find UFO reports (i.e., little known photographic cases, close encounter and landing reports, occupant cases) and all other UFO reports, many of which are carried only in small town or foreign newspapers. \"Our UFO Newsclipping Service issues are 20-page monthly reports, reproduced by photo-offset, containing the latest United States and Canadian UFO newsclippings, with our foreign section carrying the latest British, Australian, New Zealand and other foreign press reports. Also included is a 3-5 page section of \"Fortean\" clippings (i.e. Bigfoot and other \"monster\" reports). Let us keep you informed of the latest happenings in the UFO and Fortean fields.\" For subscription information and sample pages from our service, write today to: UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE Route 1 — Box 220 Plumerville, Arkansas 72127 Arcturus Book Service, 263 North BallstonAvenue, Scotia, NY 12302.

McCampbell, Director for Research has suggested Professional Forum as the vehicle or title that is characterized as a place for open discussion among many people. We want to encourage our most qualified people to contribute articles that analyze the available data on UFOs and provide insights pertaining to their professional specialties; Contributions are not limited to only consultants, because research specialists and many of our members have specialized talents. Each paper must be identified by providing the author's name, degrees or educational level, and your MUFON Title or occupation. Drafts of submitted papers will be forwarded for preliminary screening to Mr. McCampbell. Worthy material would be distributed for review to appropriate MUFON consultants for comments on the technical soundness of the article in all fields that we have covered. Suitable revisions or adjustments would be negotiated with the authors, whenever necessary. At this stage, Jim would forward the manuscripts to the editor of the Journal, Bob Pratt, along with a record of the reviews and comments. Publication would be at the sole discretion of the editor based upon his assessment of general interest, long- term value in the literature, clarity, and competition from other submittals. Such procedures are envisioned to appy to only a small fraction of the Journal content so as to preserve the major portion for articles of general interest. Please forward all. articles pertaining to the Professional Forum to MUFON at 103 Oldtowne Road, Seguin, Texas 78155. 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE by Walt Andrus On January 6, 1984, the MUFON Metroplex group in the Dallas, Texas area elected not to host the MUFON 1984 UFO Symposium when Lindy Whitehurst, the replacement chairman for the Rev. G. Neal Hern, secured employment in Houston Texas. The lack of an enthusiastic and dynamic chairperson discouraged the host committee, resulting in their decision. Not to be discouraged, the San Antonio MUFON group voted on January 12th to host the 1984 symposium in San Antonio, Texas with Tom Deuley as Chairperson. As noted in my Director's Message in the November 1983 issue, a few revisions were being made in the featured speakers. The following people will submit papers for the proceedings and speak: Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Barry J. Greenwood, Mrs. Cynthia Hind (Zimbabwe), Paul B. Norman (Australia), Mrs. Marge Christensen, John F. Schuessler, Alan C. Holt and Tom Adams. More details will be forthcoming in the Journal as they develop. According to Steve Lewis, one of the producers for the ABC-TV Night Line program, the planned UFO special has been delayed until something newsworthy breaks concerning UFOs. Since all of the preliminary filming was done at the University of Nebraska, Dr. Hynek and Walt Andrus will probably have only one day advance notice when they will appear live from the nearest ABC-TV affiliate station. The ABC-TV news team thus feels prepared to lead their competitors when the next significant UFO news item breaks. *** In the October 1983 issue (Number 188) of the MUFON UFO JOURNAL in my Director's Message concerning Philip Klass' attempt to scuttle the University of Nebraska UFO Conference, Robert A. Mortenson, Director of Conferences and Institutes, provided the following correction in his letter received January 6, 1984. Quoting from Mr. Mortenson's letter, he has said: \"Your message indicates that a call was made to Chancellor Massengale here at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln. This statement is not correct. Mr. Klass contacted Mr. Russ Free and myself only and did not directly contact the Chanclelor. It would be appreciated if you would correct this erroneous impression that the Chancellor was contacted directly and that the Chancellor's office conducted any investigation or held interviews in regard to this matter.\" Due to the exceptional cooperation of Mr. Mortenson at the conference, it is imperative that this matter should be clarified. Mr. Mortenson is to be commended for recognizing the ploy by Philip Klass and initiating the original letter of August 23, 1983, to Dr. John yost, Assistant to the Chancellor, thus keeping the Chancellor's office advised. *** KENNETH R. McLEAN Michael A. Lewis recently submitted his resignation as State Director for Wyoming due to business responsibilities and recommended Kenneth R. McLean, a former State Section Director in Colorado, for this position. Mr. McLean, who resides in Laramie, Wyoming, has both a B.S. in Psychology and a B.A. in Journalism. He attended the MUFON 1982 Symposium in Toronto, Ontario, and the University of Nebraska Conference and has been very active in the sponsorship of the P.R.O. - U.F.O.s Summer Contactee Conferences at the University of Wyoming with Dr. R. Leo Sprinkle. Ken will be soon announcing the appointments of new State Section Directors to fill vacancies in Wyoming. Michael D. Swords, Ph.D., a professor at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, has become a new Consultant after attending the Nebraska Conference and reading the MUFON UFO Journal as a former subscriber to the Frontiers of Science. He has already submitted technical- scientific articles for publication in the Journal. As a teacher, he has the unique ability to write technical articles that are down-to-earth and readily understandable by the lay person. Dan R. Wright, State Director for Michigan, has appointed the following two ladies to roles of greater responsibility: Mrs. Dorothy I. Lewis, presently a Provincial Sectional Director for Lambton County in Ontario, has been additionally assigned as State Section Director for adjoining St. Clair County in Michigan. Over the years, Dorothy has been lecturing on UFOs, and making radio and TV appearances throughout the Sarnia, Ontario area. Harriet Beech of Lansing, Michigan, has been promoted from Field Investigator to State Section Director for Ingham, Eaton and Jackson Counties. Harriet has attended all of the recent MUFON UFO Symposiums, thus becoming well acquainted with MUFON's goals and objectives. As an executive secretary, she has typed many of the UFO sighting reports emanating from Michigan for Dan Wright. William G. Hinrichsen, Continen- tal Coordinator for South America, has recently approved the following organizational alignments in Brazil: Jose Victor Scares, who has been MUFON's Representative for Brazil since 1974 and living in Gravatay, R.G.S., will now become the Sectional Representative for Eastern Brazil. Professor A.J. Gevaerd, a colleague of Mr. Scares in C.P.D.V., has been appointed Sectional Representative for Western Brazil. Prof. Gevaerd lives in Campo Grande, M.S. and is the coordinator of the Center for Flying (continued on page 18)"}]
