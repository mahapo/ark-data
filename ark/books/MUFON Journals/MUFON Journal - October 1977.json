Hall, Associate Editor of The Mufon UFO Journal and MUFON Inter- national Coordinator will alternate each month as Editor with your Intemation Director until such time as a permanent editor is assigned this responsibility. This will give us an opportunity to work simultaneously and bring the Journal to a current status. The Journal will keep its readers abreast of the progress and status of NASA's entry into the UFO investigation each month. Dr. Richard C. Henry has submitted his recommendation to Dr. Robert A. Frosch, NASA Adminis- trator, who in turn will reply to President Jimmy Carter's Scientific Advisor, Dr. Frank Press. Despite the negative response of Dave Williamson, NASA assistant for special projects, to the proposed reopening of the UFO investigation by a government agency, something positive could eminate from Jimmy Carter's assignment to NASA. Considering that both Dr. Frosch and Dr. Press will add their comments and recom- mendations to the evaluation by Dr. Henry, their personal bias either pro or con could radically influence the outcome as delivered to the President. To date, neither Dr. Frosch or Dr. Press has made a public statement that might disclose their decision. The need for financial funding and manpower to conduct a study and investigation has cropped up in statements to the press, giving NASA and the President \"an out\" if they elect not to conduct an indepth study.

California professional photographer. Fred Svihus and his wife Eva were returning to the States from a New. Zealand vacaction trip. Their airliner landed at Los Angeles International Airport early in the morning. Shortly thereafter the Boeing 747 Jumbo Jet took off from the Los Angeles airport for the final destination of their journey to San Francisco International. Svihus. [pronounced Sweeas) and his wife both had window seats one behind the other on the port side of the aircraft. Svihus was fascinated by the mechanical workings of the aircraft flap system on the trailing edge of the wing just slightly ahead of his seat position and was movie filming the flap action as it slowly receded to its inflight position within the wing. The big airliner headed northwest up the coast towards San Francisco, The morning was beautiful and clear with just a few scattered clouds. About fifteen minutes out of Los Angeles, at approximately 8:00 a.m. and about 20.000 feet of altitude, the 747 was cruising close to Vandenburg A.F.B. The view out of the port side of the plane showed clear blue sky to the southwest and the massiveness of the/ocean down below with the sun on the opposite side of the aircraft. Svihus was intermittently filming the wing and clouds when an outcry from his wife behind him alerted his attention to what he instinctively saw at the same time himself. \"My God. what's that?\" she exclaimed! \"Do you see it Fred?\" He answered, \"Yes. I'm filming it.\" Four glowing objects suddenly appeared in the sky opposite their window position and slightly lower in altitude, speeding by in the opposite direction. The objects .were in echelon formation, somewhat oval in appearance, and moving by very rapidly at an estimated five to seven miles distance from the 747. Utilizing his skills as a professional photographer, Svihus continued to \"pan\" the flight of four objects as they went past his window being careful to steady the camera and holding it as close to the plexiglass window as possible without touching the lens shell to it. He was able to \"Copyright Fred Svihus \\91T glance up occasionally to view the flight with his naked eyes as he worked the camera and continued to film the objects as they continued on out of sight behind the airliner. As they were just about out of sight, he .watched as the four suddenly broke formation and \"scattered\", then were lost from view. Reflections of any kind were ruled out due to the closeness of the lens to the window and the fact that the UFO's were very obvious against a clear blue sky .with the sun shining on them from the opposite side of the airplane where the observers were seated. The whole experience lasted only a matter of seconds and as far as is known, none of the other passengers aboard, which were only a very few,"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"/ t.2C~ \" »,* J l J. _?^_'\"'** M —if~^t~\"l\"\"—* *J affirrai^SF i; • *2-, I IMIIMM1. l*^«0« I lMfn»« ' •' \\  * ^Mn> Mo^l«~^y ~J^ StNTA BARBARA W> ^Santa^onicF/X^iS 1 \"' 4 •/.A CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PA1ROL EMERGEiiCY TELEPHONE . . - To report »n ACCIDENT or - - 'TRAFFIC EMERGENCY outside • cities, or on city freeway . when Uiere-aie no call tcies. . . dial Operator and ai* la > ZEnith 1 2000 - - On city streets .- , • * CALL LOCAL POLICE \\ \\"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"apparently saw the spectacle. Most had .departed from the aircraft at Los Angeles. At, one point in the filming, he managed to \"Zoom\" the objects in closer. The Bolex movie camera was filming at standard eighteen frames per second. The UFO's were exposed on thirty-two individual frames of the film. Near the Los Angeles airport, while in flight, at the proper perspective turn of the aircraft, Mr. Svihus shot out a few frames of the moon as it was visible in the early morning sky just above the wing. This is on the same roll of film. It was interesting to compare the size of this two-thirds moon as seen over the wing tip, to the later shots of the \"unknowns\", which appeared to this observer as about one-third to one- quarter the size of the moon in comparison. Analysis of the film will be attempted very soon by professional photo-analysts and results should be forthcoming in the near future. From communication with the airline, which definitely wishes to remain anonymous, for obvious, reasons, though they are quite interested in the film, it was felt that the crew saw the objects. This has not been confirmed and the airline spokesman was rather evasive and noncommittal about this point. This may or may not have a bearing on the fact that according to Svihus, who called the FBI thinking they may have an interest, notified' Navy Intelligence and the'-O.S.I. There is also an indication of Washington, D.C. White House interest. It is interesting to note that the sighting took place so near Vandenburg A.F.B., hence the government interest. On Sept. 10th, 1977. coincidentally enough, another sighting of a single UFO took place in this same vicinity and was visually seen by four different airliners in that immediate area, reported by the pilots on radio. The object was closest to a DC-10 airliner, details of this incident are in MUFON files. Additionally interesting was that the Sept. 10th UFO was tracked on the Fremont, California located Oakland Air Traffic Control Radar installation. The position of the Svihus encounter was near Lompoc, California or just south of Santa Maria. Maximum viewing time was estimated at four or five seconds! One wonders how much more UFO activity has been going on around the _ Vandenburg Base. In the past years a number of unusual and outstanding reports, one with photographs, have been received by. this investigator. At those times, definite attempts were made by the military to hush up the incidents. Are the UFO's monitoring activities at Vandenburg as they seemingly are at Cape Kennedy, White Sands, and other areas? The position of the four objects with respect to one another seemed to remain relatively the same with only slight deviation noted in repeated viewing of the film. Under photographic analysis, which will be forthcoming, any deviation of the positions of the objects should be more prominent and can be measured. Of the v.arious researchers who have so far viewed . and studied the film! several felt that the objects appeared to be discoid in shape. The film was shown in July, 1977 at the MUFON Symposium by Mr. Svihus who made a special trip to Scottsdale, Arizona, at his own expense so that MUFON scientists and researchers could view the film. The photos are somewhat similar to the Montana and Utah movie film footage taken some years ago. These films at that time were of considerable interest to the Air Force Project Blue Book. It isn't everyday that daylight movie film footage of UFO's happens to be caught by an alert and professional photographer aboard an airliner as they speed past the plane. MUFON feels very honored and privileged to have been chosen as the recipient of the Svihus film. Prior to his return to the States, Mr. Svihus had read articles in the New Zealand newspapers of recent UFO sightings in the Los Angeles area.

In the evaluation of any UFO photograph, the creditability of the photographer is even more important than the picture itself, when the .authenticity is being determined. The photo, alone, is not adequate for the photo analyst to conduct a study. He must have all of the details and conditions under which the photo was made, including camera model, exposure time, F-stop, focus distance, type of film, etc. To give the Journal readers further insight into the creditability of the photographer and witnesses, the following pertinent information is being shared with you. Fred Svihus (pronounced SWEEAS) is a retired tool maker and formerly owned Tool and Die Welding Engineering Company where they did extensive research in this field. Of Swedish ancestory, Fred prides himself as a professional photographer, which in this case was an asset, since he knew exactly how to respond. His wife, Eva, is a retired Captain of the Civil Air Patrol (C.A.P.), a trained observer, and a pilot in her own right. Her father, Capt. Roy N. Francis, was an \"early bird flyer\", the first executive officer of Kelly Field, San Antonio, Texas during World War I. Capt. Francis' pilot log shows that he flew the first Martin bomber and used it to lay out the route for the Army Air Corps, to make their first cross continent flight. After retirement, he. was the second person to serve as superintendent of Mills Field, now known as the San Francisco International Airport. Fred and Eva consider themselves as very normal people, who were very fortunate to have been filming the aircraft wingjQaps as the four objects passed through their view within four or five seconds. Since Fred did not \"believe\" in UFOs, he did not question the other passengers aboai d when they landed in San Francisco for fear of influencing them if there was an investigation conducted. After the motion film was developed, Fred did contact both government and civil authorities. Fred and Eva reside in Belmont, California where they have, met with James McCampbell, and Paul Cerny. MUFON has not only a copy of the super 8, 35mm motion picture film of the sequence, but 8x10 color enlargements of individual frames that are used in this issue of the Journal. Mr. Svihus has filed a copyright application on his film which is presently being processed. MUFON is honored that we were selected for exclusive utilization and analysis of this film. GSW, Inc. is presently conducting a photo analysis on one .of the 8 x 10 enlargements depicting the four objects."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"By Ann Druffel \"New Insights into Old Mysteries\" With great pleasure I greet the arrival of an original book upon the UFO scene—Adrian Vance's UFOs, The Eye and The Camera. Adrian is a resident of Southern California and for many years has been an industrious, concerned participant in NICAP and MUFON investigations. The. UFO research field has been treated during the past several years to about a dozen significant books, written by various experts who meet all the criteria for objectivity, integrity and experience. UFOs The Eye and The Camera is one of these books—with a difference; ' While the other dozen authors have ranged in writing ability from passable to professional, Vance's writing skills are best described as picturesquely excellent. With this difficult alliterative label in mind, imagine a UFO book with a completely different theory from any other. Vance's selected UFOs are not plodding, aging space travelers, not stray .intradimensional visitors, not Pucks and elves from Magoniatype worlds. His UFOs are time travelers-- advanced navigators~and he makes a very good case to prove his theory. Author Vance is a gentleman who '•/ears many hats upon his shock of, black hair. He is a physical scientist, a mathematician, professional photographer, expert photo technician, educational filmstrip producer, free-lance writer, and presently West Coast.editor of Popular Photography magazine.  ' Besides his professional qualifi- cations, he is a humanist. The problem of UFOs is personal to him, disturbing in their possible implications to the human race. Years ago he set his mind toward investigating the. mystery i and feels now that he has punctured a small part of the veil covering these puzzling phenomenon of modern times. In his, research he brings to bear not only his cerebral scholarship, but also.- an intriguing degree of intuition. UFOs, The Eye and The Camera is lifee-an Indian curry. The solid technical information contained within it s pages is made palatable even to readers who would ordinarily find it difficult to follow texts involving physics and math. In addition, spicing up the scientific discourses, are gems of priceless simile, onomatopoeia, and hyperbole; This knowledgeable author, has a delicious sense of subtle humor. Adrian is a product .of Southern California UFO research, and we are proud of his many contributions to the field. He has unstintingly given of his time on photo' cases throughout the years; he has the same quality in his time-travel theory. No pussy-footing here, no qualifying, no attempts to leave holes through which he can back out if later proved wrong. He has spent many years developing his theory that some UFOs are craft traveling in time. He cites the Oregon, Sedona, and Alaska multiple-image photos to illustrate, and the quality and quantity of work he has done to back up his theory is impressive. He shows the reader how and why he conducted his .research on each particular facet, even including bits of intuitive thinking. I am tempted to wonder whether the answers to the UFO mystery will eventually be found by researchers who inadvertently tap the psychic realm. : A good writer succeeds in presenting word pictures. Vance goes a step beyond and writes word niovies which delight and stimulate the mind. His description of the command-level AF officials whose mental fuses were melted by the repeated UFO assaults on the forbidden air-corridor over the White House in 1952 is an example. These gentlemen, according to Vance, went into a stammering act from which they have never recovered. It's an accurate assessment of U.S. government policy. He wisely points out that the study of UFOs is an interdisciplinary science. When he first became aware of discrepancies in several ostensibly authentic but puzzling photos, he realized that such photos had to be studied from the point of view of the two viewing channels through which they had been detected-i.e., the eye, and the camera. He felt qualified enough in the 8"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"photographic part but admits with refreshing frankness that his knowledge of human vision was sadly lacking. Studying to fill in his knowledge, he was able to combine the two sciences in interdisciplinary fashion to develop a workable hypothesis explaining at least one type of UFO. The section of his book which deals with the intermittent cycle in human vision is fascinating. This is not • presented as dry fact. We can actually see Vance spinning, night and day, i black-and-white configurated wheels based on the principles of \"Benham's top\". We can feel his sleeplessness and suppressed hunger. We can see the puzzlement of his great German Shepherd, Boris, looking on and perhaps fearing that his master had slipped his cogs. We can delight in Adrian's insatiable search for truth, whatevery or wherever ;that might prove to be. He is convinced, and is convincing, that in his book he has reached out and grabbed for himself a part of the Truth. . Vance is not, only a scientist, a theorist, and a humanist. He is also a philosopher. As he states in his Preface, \"We are likely not ready for full-fledged citizenship in the universe, but in any population there are usually a few who can make use of an information. It is to these people that we speak.\" He had developed an approach which might possibly lead to eventual i solution of the UFO mystery. It's one which other researchers might -well adopt. It is to seperate, if possible, the UFO phenomenon into its recognizable parts. We are all convinced that the UFO mystery is of such complexity that the human mind is boggled. But there are certain.clues that lead us to think that various types of UFOs can be separated and studied apart from the rest of the teeming mass. Case in point: Vance's multiple-image photos. He has separated and studied these with stunning results. The problem, then, is not merely a need for specialization, but for specialization, within inter- disciplinary fields. He also delves into other phenomena -ancient maps, Biblical reports, the Bermuda Triangle, etc.-which are suspected to be related to the UFO problem. In these discussions, too, he brings to bear his unique gifts of research and .interdisciplinary theorizing. Someday, he threatens, he will sail straight into the. Triangle, hoping that on-the-spot investigation will.provide clues to the mystery. I can picture him there, wearing his many hats with Boris at his side. My bet will be riding on his ability to puncture another small hole in that.very .thick veil. Putting together Vance's expertise and style and his.publisher's splendid promotion of this book, it should be an artistic, scientific and financial success. Available at $8.95 from book stpres.pr Barlenmir House, 413 City Island Ave., New York, NY 10064, it should speed quickly to public and private libraries throughout the world on wings of light- or time.  • jMarkR.Herbstritt stronomy Notes THE SKY FOR OCTOBER 1977 Mercury - It is poorly placed' for observation, being in superior conjunction on the 18th.

Uke other years, the big flap of 77 didn't materialize in the U.S.A. Instead, the elusive UFO \"strategists\" have switched their target to Western Australia. According to a mass of clippings received from my source in Melbourne, dozens of reported Close Encounters of the First and Second Kind have occurred during military manuevers in September and October — and, is continuing. I'm sure we'll get some well investigated material from reliable sources soon for review in our Journal. Two British astronomers, Sir. Fred Hbyle, professor of astronomy at the respected Royal Institution of Great Britain, and, Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe. of applied mathematics at Cardiff University, have presented a provocative theory in New Scientist which speculates that primeval life on Earth could have come from outer space. They also aver that major epidemics like flu and plague may come from extraterrestrial sources. About 4 million years ago, their article suggested, a comet could have crash- ' landed on Earth bringing primitive • organisms from which all life evolved. Sudden plagues, they said, that have irregularly swept the globe could be the result of fresh attempts at the evolution of life on comets... Coming to this writer's mind is the still mysterious Legionnaires disease and whether or not the hypothetical carrier of primitive life and disease was of random • cometary or purposeful vehicular origin. During a mid-September visit to New York, I was invited by the Grenada Mission to discuss the worldwide UFO problem with Ambassadors Franklin Dolland and Dr. Wellington Friday. .On the request of Dr. Friday, Ambassador at Large, I prepared a 4- page paper describing the objectives of scientific UFO research which was included in Prime Minister Sir Eric Matthew Gairy's proposal to the 32nd Session of the United Nation's General Assembly, October 7, 1977. His proposal basically expressed the need of a permanent agency to be established in the UN to exchange UFO data between all nations of the world. On November 28, Grenada's proposal will be debated in the Special Political Committee at the UN. Dr. Friday explained in his letter to this writer, October 14, that \"first, we need to muster up sufficient support from national delegations to the General Assembly, and second, we need to .arouse and sustain the interest of experts in the field and secure their endorsement....! am sure you would be able to help us here again ...\" On November 14, Dr. Friday invited the writer to attend the UN debate and act as advisor on behalf of Grenada during the proceedings. At this writing, November 22, I am hoping that finances will allow me to , attend the UN debate. I feel honored : and will report on this high level affair in 1 a future column. We're all waiting word from NASA hoping for a positive move to begin a scientific UFO study following a White , House directive for that agency to look into the matter. In the meanwhile NASA is undertaking the task as the official mail drop for the White House, handling UFO mail which is increasing in volume. With rumors rife, on October 18, I called Mr. David Williamson, Assistant Director of Special Projects for NASA in Washington, D.C., for his comments. His response indicated an interest in my work for Grenada at the UN and he asked that I submit other ideas that might be useful in the NASA/UFO probe. Following, is the contents of a letter dated October 19, I sent to Mr. Williamson to which was attached a copy of the paper prepared for Grenada:  ' \"...Enclosed for your review, pursuant : to our phone talk, October 18,1977, is a copy of UFO Status Quo which I had prepared on the request of Dr. Wellington Friday, Ambassador at Large, of Grenada, for presentation by his Prime Minister, Sir Eric Gairy at the 32nd Assembly of the United Nations, October 7, 1977.

I firmly . believe, based on the constant input of information received from reliable sources and the general public, that for NASA to perform, or succeed, effectively and objectively in this endeavor, that certain top secret data should be made available to a nuclei of scientific and administrative personnel that may be named to serve NASA. Anything less would be a duplication of effort, and become an exercise in futility. I also firmly believe that significant data, and perhaps \"hardware\", does exist within the framework of various official agencies or military areas of the United States. Such data, etc., I believe, have been (and remain to be) contained • in inaccessible files of the Department of Defense, a certain office of the C.I.A., hidden underground at Wright- Patterson AFB, and in the photo analytical labs of Naval Intelligence. I do not claim to know the secret official exchange of certain vital data (beyond that which is available to the public at the National Archives from Project Bluebook files), but whatever is being suppressed by these agencies certainly would be vital in any proposed NASA exercise to perform scientifically with the ongoing UFO problem: Without sounding presumptuous or mystical, I am personally aware of certain UFO DATA of an \"unsettling\" nature. However, because of the sensitivity of some of the data, and the promise to keep the names of my informants confidential, I cannot discuss these matters by phone. I will be happy to assist or serve NASA in any capacity on the premise that its project is geared objectively and hopefully, scientifically, to determine the UFO's nature, origin and intents. As stressed in my recently published book, Situation Red, published by Doubleday, I believe that the UFO deserves serious review...\" Not having heard from NASA by October 28,1 called Mr. Williamson. At this time he expressed \"little hope\" for a NASA agency. The main reason was inadequate funds. The other, was the familiar tune that there was nothing in the category of \"hard evidence\" to justify technical research. \"NASA is a technical agency,\" he said. \"We cannot derive anything substantive from UFO reports unless we can analyze the reporter's minds.\" When I asked Williamson about my references to substantive data — hardware, gun camera photos and even humanoids allegedly held in highest secrecy in various official agencies — I was told that NASA has had access to all the named agencies and the claims that they were hiding information, artifacts or entities, were only unfounded stories. On November 15, I phoned Williamson to get an update. He stated that NASA was still pursuing its study for the establishment of a useful project and that it \"was not taking it (the project) lightly\". I also told Williamson that since our last chat that I had received additional data relative to the preserved humanoids allegedly examined and stored at Wright-Patterson AFB in past years. Again, as expected, he claimed no knowledge of the alien bodies. Realizing the sensitivity of this \"finai proof phase of the alleged UFO cover- up, I suggested that NASA needed only a \"technical\" shovel with which to dig underground next to the vaults at Wright-Patterson where the deceased humanoids have been held — and may still be. The controversial \"little men\" stories for so long ridiculed by officialdom and most civilian researchers (including myself until 1976) are no longer so funny or so far out. While preparing my book, Situation Red, I uncovered some sobering data relative to their existence. Since the book's release in June of 1977,1 have been privy to more confirmative data...including first hand accounts from former military witnesses...Unless my informants have been \"planted\" for covert reasons, or, are skilled hoaxers, I believe the humanoid factor in UFO research should be seriously considered... 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND By Walt Andrus November 15th marked the premier showing of Columbia Pictures UFO epic, \"Close Encounters Of The Third Kind\" in both New York City and Hollywood. It is destined to take its place as a science fiction thriller along with \"Jaws\" and \"Star Wars\", however, it has one distinct advantage over the two prior films. It is not a UFO documentary. Steven Spielberg, the writer and director, has composed the story around authenticated UFO events that are familiar to knowledgeable UFOlogists. It is such a down to earth presentation that any viewer, leaving the theater could truthfully say--\"that could have happened to me\". Close Encounters Of The Third Kind or CE3K, as the people at Columbia refer to their big Christmas season movie, has been kept under closer wraps than a military secret for four years. Nearly one year of filming was done in a gigantic hanger in Mobile, Alabama, while the special effects were produced in Hollywood by Douglas Trumbull, the magician of CE3K. Newsweek, in its November 21st issue, devoted seven full pages plus the cover to \"The UFO's Are Coming\"- Hollywoods Close Encounters. The San Antonio Express-News featured a full page spread in the Sunday, November 20th issue. Jack Kroll in Newsweek emphasizes Steven Spielberg's humanistic touch that is so prevalent compared to \"Star Wars\". His hero, Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss), is pure Joe Citizen: a hard hat who works for an electrical-power company in Indiana, A Dagwood-type husband with a Blondie-type wife (Ten Garr) and three cute kids, a solid suburbanite with a snack-stocked 12 refrigerator who gets his news from Walter Cronkite and enjoys tinkering with electric trains. Neary wants a flying saucer in his life about as much as he wants a massive power blackout in his area. But that's exactly what he gets- both of them. Roy's experience with the UFO's turns his life inside out and leads him through a series of adventures - comic and catastrophic .-• to an ultimate rendevous with creatures from beyond the stars. Spielberg, a basically traditionalist filmmaker, starts with the classic genre of the 1950°s \"It Came From Outer Space\" science fiction flick, but stretches its scale and resonance with brilliant special effects until the film flares up into something approaching awe. \"Close Encounters\" is the friendliest^ warmest SF epic you've.ever seen. It brings the heavens down to earth. Spielberg adopts some of the Walt Disney influence with his metamorphic genius, sentimental idealism and his feeling for the technical magic of movies as a paradigm for a technological Utopia. As the readers of the JOURNAL have known for nearly two years, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, the technical consultant for CE3K, the title having been taken from his book \"The UFO Experience\". To review the entire picture in this brief column might take away the tremendous build up that occurs in the last forty minutes as the film in the huge hanger and awesome lighting effects bring the picture to a grand climax. It is a picture for the entire family, which is refreshing in this day of sex and pornography. Stanton Friedman saw the Hollywood premier and was a little disappointed from UFOlogist's viewpoint. The picture was not intended to be a UFO documentary, but a form of entertainment for the public at large, giving each an opportunity to share in the UFO experience. Every UFOlogist must see the picture so that they are thoroughly cognizant with its contents. There was a fear that the beings and\" craft might influence subsequent UFO sighting descriptions. However, authenticated cases were depicted, which prevented introduction of new humanoid species or unusual space craft. We encourage MUFON members to arrange cooperative ventures with their local theater managers, as a further means of educating the public and to identify themselves in their own communities as the source of UFO information and the recipients of UFO sighting reports. 00% BKQUNTBtS OF TW THRD KBD /APMLLIPSKOOyCnON • A STEVEN SPICiBERCHUI* RICHARD DREYFUSS, BUCK fcy DOUOAS TlUMiUU . .

Maccabee MUFON State Director for Maryland I have recently received over four hundred of the several thousand(i) pages of documents in the FBI files on \"flying discs\". I have been informed(i) that these pages represent the \"cream of the crop\" and that the rest include references to UFO's in other documents; copies of form letters sent out by the FBI, and copies of readily available publications (including at least one book on UFO's.) After reviewing the documents, I have decided that the opinion of the FBI agent(i) who handled my FOIPA (Freedom of Information) request was correct: these probably are the most important documents, in the FBI files. The pages I have obtained are divided into three categories as follows, roughly 40% are • poor reports and documents which do not add anything (in my opinion) to what is already known about certain UFO reports and known hoaxes (e.g., the Maury Island hoax which \"resulted\" in the death of two Army Air Force Officers, is covered in great detail); roughly 40% are teletype reports and transcripts concerning reasonably to very good UFO reports, some of which are riot listed in the Blue Book file at the National Archives, and some of which never have been published before (this. statement may riot be entirely accurate since I have not been able to check all possible sources of previously published UFO reports); the remaining proportion are papers which consist of internal memoranda of the FBI. This last proportion contains papers which have definitely not been available before now. They show the internal involvement of the FBI, and, even more interesting, they shed light on the attitude of the Air Force towards UFO investigation. As a result of the FOIPA request to the FBI, I have also obtained several documents from other agencies which had sent \"complementary Part 1 (copyright, 1977, by B Maccabee) copies\" to the FBI. One of these is a radar-visual case from Alaska in 1950 that was filed by the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI). Other documents have come from the Army and the Air Force. It should be emphasized at the outset that the bulk of these documents were generated between 1947 and 1955, and that the FBI file on UFO's comes to a screeching halt in 1964 with the Zamorra case (Socorro, New Mexico). (There was an FBI agent in the police office at the time Zamorra's call came in, and this agent wrote a report that was sent to FBI headquarters. In the report, the agent vouched for Zamorra's credibility.) There is enough material in the FBI file to form a small book, if all the documents were to be published. However, in order to make the information available to interested researchers in a short time, I have decided to write several papers based on the FBI file, rather than write a book. Since of necessity some information will' be left out or merely alluded to in these papers, I will accept requests for information and will respond with a letter saying the information is or is not in the file, and I will send copies of pertinent documents when they are available. • In this first paper, I will present an overview of the FBI files and a \"preview\" of things to come. In subsequent papers, I will publish copies of actual FBI documents, summaries of documents, UFO reports, and comments on the documents as I see fit. Readers will thus be able to judge for themselves whether or not the FBI had any major interest in or affect upon the history of UFO research. Perhaps historians, of UFO research will get some new insights into the.early days of UFO's and those who are interested mainly in the content of UFO reports will find some more \"grist for the mill\", As for myself, I am- more firmly convinced that if we understood wh^t happened during the first several yer.rs of the UFO phenomenon, we.wruld understand the whole UFO phenomenon. .  - • . '. General FBI Involvement .Perhaps the most important question to be asked in regard to. the \"FBI Connection\" is \"Was the FBI ever officially involved?\" Secondary questions concern the duration and nature of the involvemennt. The answer to the first question is a resounding \"yes\", and the duration of official involvement was July 30 to October 1 in 1947. However, the FBI remained \"unofficially\" involved up through 1964: During the period of official involvement, the FBI agents were instructed by Hoover to investigate UFO witnesses. After October 1947, however, the FBI was supposed to turn all investigations over to armed forces (specifically, the Army Air Force until 1948, and the Air Force after the spring of 1948). The. agents were generally faithful to Hoover's orders after October and stopped carrying out detailed investigations. However, this did not stop them from filing reports on UFO sightings and witnesses, nor did it stop them from checking up on police and FBI records, on witnesses at the request of other intelligence agencies. A typical FBI report after October 1947 would end with statements similar to \"this matter is being reported to the bureau for information purposes\"(2), \"for your informatipn\"(3), \"furnishing this info to bureau for whatever action they (sic) deem advisable\"(4), or \"above being furnished for information\"®. Aside from the collection of UFO reports and the transmissal of such reports to Air Force collection agencies (Army G-2 (Please turn page) •*••*"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"before 1948, Air Force Office of Special Investigations - OSO - and Project Blue Book after the Spring of 1948), the FBI maintained a loose connection with the Air Force investigations of UFO's. Several times FBI agents interviewed Air Force personnel, once at the specific request of Hoover<6). The FBI was also the recipient of unrequested copies of AF, ONI and Army intelligence documents and UFO reports. However, the number of documents filed per year on the subject of UFO's dropped precipitously after 1952, and by 1959 had reached zero. From then on only one or two \"complaints\" per year were noted at annual reviews of the FBI guidlines for handling UFO reports, at least until 1963 when the annual reviews were ended. The last report in the file(i), as mentioned before, was the Zamorra report. Presumably it wouldn't have been filed if it hadn't been for the fact that there was an FBI agent present shortly after the sighting who knew Zamorra very we'll. The decrease in the number of reports filed probably resulted from a combination of factors, the most important being the intent of the FBI to get out of the UFO business. As previously stated, the FBI agents were directed to avoid carrying out investigations after October, 1947,'ahd, furthermore, they were directed to forward any information to the Air Force. Thus the Air Force carried out the detailed investigations (what little they did) while the FBI faded into the background. From the point of view of the FBI this was desirable since the FBI was mainly interested in internal subversion and not in military craft (or hoaxes, or misidentifications, etc.). In fact, it was the possibility of internal subversion which brought the FBI into the picture initially. To see how the FBI became involved it is necessary to go back to the summer of 1947 when \"flying saucers\" were \"bom\". The FBI vs The \"Flying Discs\" During the first weeks of July, FBI offices around the country begain to receive requests from newsmen for 14 information on flying saucers. The central office in Washington also received teletype messages about various \"discs\" that had been found (all obvious hoaxes). However, the first document of real importance was filed 7/10/47. Since it gives an in-depth view of the early official interest in \"flying discs\", I am printing it in its entirety, along with comments made by J. E. Hoover.(T) Subject: FLYING DISCS \"At request of Brigadier General George F. Schulgen, Chief of the Requirements Intelligence Branch of Army Air Corps Intelligence, Special Agent (name crossed off; call him \"SA\") discussed the above captioned matter (i.e., flying discs) with him on July 9, 1947. General Schulgen indicated to SA that the Air Corps has taken the attitude that every effort must be undertaken in order to run down and ascertain whether or not the flying discs are a fact and, if so, to learn all about them. According to General Schulgen, the Air Corps Intelligence are utilizing all of their scientists in order to ascertain whether or not such a phenomenon could in fact occur. He stated that this research is being conducted ..with the thought that the flying objects might be a celestial phenomenon and with the view that they might be a foreign body mechanically devised and controlled (underlining by this author).\" \"General Schulgen also indicated to SA that all Air Corps installations have been alerted to run out each reported sighting to obtain all possible data to assist in this research project. In passing, General Schulgen stated that an Air Corps pilot who believed that he saw one of these objects was thoroughly interrogated by General Schlgen and scientists, as well as a physchologist, and the pilot was adamant in his claim that he saw a flying disc (underlining by this author).\" \"General Schulgen advised SA that the possibility exists that the first reported sightings of the so-called flying discs were fallacious and prompted by individuals seeking personal publicity, or. were reported for political reasons. He stated that if this was so, subsequent sightings might be the result of mass hysteria. He pointed out that the thought exists that the first reported sightings might have been by individuals of Communist sympathies with the view to causing hysteria and fear of a secret Russian weapon.\" \"General Schulgen indicated to SA that he is desirous of having all the angles covered in this matter. He stated that reports of his scientists and findings of various Air Corps installations will be available in his office. He advised that to complete the picture, he desired the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in locating and questioning the individuals who first sighted the so-called flying discs in order to ascertain whether or not they are sincere in their statements that they saw these discs, or whether their statements were prompted by personal desire for publicity or political reasons. General Schulgen assured SA that there are no War Department or Navy Department research projects presently being conducted which could in any way be tied up with the flying discs. General Schulgen indicated to SA that if the Bureau would cooperate with him in this matter, he would offer all the facilities of his office as to results obtained in the effort to indentify and run down this matter.\" \"SA advised General Schulgen that his request would be made known to the Bureau and an answer made available'to him as soon as possible.\" \"SA also discussed this matter with Col. L. R. Forney of MID. Col. Forney indicated that it was his attitude that inasmuch as it has been established that the flying discs are not the result of any Army or Navy experiments, the matter is of interest to the FBI. He stated that he was of the opinion that the Bureau, if at all possible, should accede to General Schulgen's request.\" D. M. Ladd, the FBI official to whom the above memorandum was addressed, wrote the following addedum to the memorandum: (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"ADDENDUM \"I would recommend that we advise the Army that the Bureau does not believe it should go into these investigations, it being noted that a great bulk of those alleged discs reported found have been pranks. It is not believed that the Bureau would accomplish, anything by going into these investigations.\" However, Mr. Tolson scribbled \"I think we should do it\" on July 15th, and shortly thereafter Hoover added the following comments: \"I would do it but before agreeing to it we must insist upon full access to discs recovered. For instance in the La. case the Army grabbed it and would riot let us have it for cursory examination.\" . About a week later, another memorandum was filed that indicated the General Schulgen had been informed of the FBI (i.e., Hoover's) decision. The first paragraph of this memorandum reiterates the previous information. It then continues as follows :(8) \"This is to advise that SA has recontacted General Schulgen and advised him in connection with the Director's notation (i.e.; Hoover's comment above). General Schulgen indicated to SA that he desired to assure Mr. Hoover of complete cooperation in this matter and stated that he would issue instructions to the field directing that all cooperation be furnished to the FBI arid that all discs recovered be made available for examination by the FBI agents. (Underlining by this author.) General Schulgen pointed out to SA that he will from time to time make the results of the studies of his scientists available to the Bureau for the asistance of the FBI field offices. General Schulgen indicated to SA that there has been a decrease in the reported sightings of discs which might be because of the fact that it has lost much of its publicity value. He indicated, however, that he believed it necessary to follow this matter through to determine as near as possible if discs were in fact seen and to determine their origin.\" In the next paragraph, the communications channel between General Schulgen's office and the FBI was specified (\"regular established channels\") and the final paragraph is as follows: \"General Schulgen indicated to SA that he believed that there was a possibility that this entire matter might have been started by subversive individuals for the purpose of creating mass hysteria. He suggested that the Bureau keep this in mind in any interviews conducted regarding reported sightings. General Schulgen stated to SA that he would make available to the Bureau all information in the possession of the Air Corps regarding sightings which were first reported so that the Bureau could conduct some investigation regarding these individuals to ascertain their motives for reporting that they observed flying discs. When General Schulgen makes the information available regarding these individuals, it will be brought to your (i.e., to Mr. Ladd's) attention.\" About a week later, in. Bureau Bulletin #42 of 1947, the official order and explanation for the order\" was published. Since the explanation is itself unique, I will present it here in its entirety, along with the official order(9): \"FLYING DISCS -- The^Bureau, at the request of the Army Air Forces Intelligence, has agreed to cooperate in the investigation of flying discs. The Air Forces have confidentially advised that it is possible to release three or more discs in odd numbers, attached together by a wire, from an airplance in high altitudes and that these discs would obtain tremendous speed in their descent and would descend to the earth in an arc. The Army Air Forces Intelligence has also indicated. some concern that the reported sightings might have been made by subversive individuals for the purpose of creating mass hysteria. (This is the specific directive:) \"You should investigate each instance which is brought to your attention of a sighting of a flying disc in order to ascertain whether or not it is a bona fide sighting, an imaginary one, or a prank. You should also bear in mind that individuals might report seeing flying discs for various reasons. It is conceivable that an individual might be desirous of seeking personal publicity, causing hysteria, or playing a prank.\" \"The Bureau should be notifed immediately by teletype of all reported sightings and the results of your inquiries. In instances where the report appears to have merit, the teletype should be followed by a letter to the Bureau containing in detail the results of your inquiries. The Army Air Forces have assured the Bureau complete cooperation in these matters and in any instances where they fail to make information available to you or make the recovered discs available for your examination, it should promptly be brought to the attention of the Bureau.\" \"Any information you develop in connection with these discs should be promptly brought to the attention of the Army through- your usual liaison channels.\" Thus by the end of July, 1947, the FBI had a working arrangement with the Army Air Force to investigate UFO reports. As set up, the arrangement seemed quite amicable, -and presumably it could have continued for many years. Admittedly the initial fear of subversion faded with time, but still, the FBI could have continued investigations into the fifties if they were really worried about the possibility that the UFO reports somehow resulted from Russian attempts at sabotage. Yet, the FBI ended its official investigatory role only about two months after it began. The explicit reason why the investigations were ended will be presented in the next \"installment\" of this series, along with several interesting early reports. However, the perceptive reader can already see an incipient disagreement as to what sorts of reports the Air Force wanted the FBI to investigate. In General Schulgen's view, the FBI would investigate mainly (or only ?) those reports in which hardware was retrieved. By the time that the FBI (Cent, on back cover) 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Lucius Farrish In Others'Words The September 13 issue of National Enquirer announced that publication's sponsorship of a \"UFO spotting night\" on September 10. Results of the skywatch have not yet been announced. An item in the October 4 issue reported on the 4,026 UFO sightings which were reported to CUFOS during a five-year period which ended in April, 1977. A map shows the sighting breakdown by states, while a table lists occupant reports and other close encounter cases. The UFO role in cattle mutilations is examined in an article on Colorado happenings in the October 11 Enquirer. The Star for September 27 quotes Dr. Hynek and Dr. Sprinkle regarding President Carter's alleged promise to reveal government information about UFOs. Both men seemingly feel that Carter did not realize the extent of the UFO information in government files when he supposedly made his campaign pledge. Reports of Florida UFO sightings in early September are featured in The Star's October 11 issue. Another item on the Carter/UFOs subject is to be found in September 26 issue of Aviation Week & Space Technology. It states that the Carter administration has \"cooled\" on UFO research, with White House Science Advisor Frank Press handing over the job of answering UFO inquiries to NASA. That agency is not too happy about its new task and is not even sure that any UFO research is needed. It now seems clear that the rumored \"governmental announcements\" on UFOs were more wishful thinking than anything else. The November issue of Fate has an article by Curt Sutherly on the strange UFO \"invasion\" of Boshkung Lake, near Minden, Ontario, Canada. Some changes are evident in the November issue of UFO Report, with more space being devoted to psychic topics. There is also an astrology column, of little value at best, and certainly out of place in a UFO magazine. This issue contains articles by Brad Steiger, D. Scott Rogo,; Charles Berlitz, John Keel, Jerome Clark and others,, as well as an interview with John Keel. The November/December issue of Beyond Reality contains an article on UFOs as time travelers, plus another feature on UFOs and cattle mutilations. The \"downhill plunge\" of Official UFO, prophesied in previous columns, is rapidly coming to pass. No better example could be found than the December . issue of that magazine, which is nothing but a collection of utter trash. Although I'm reluctant to even mention it again, considering my past record on this particular item, it appears that Playboy is finally going to print its \"Playboy Panel\" feature on UFOs in an upcoming issue. Watch for it in either the December or January issue (maybe). A few words now about some new UFO periodicals. First, the Kent UFO News Bulletin, published quarterly by the Cosmic Society Research Consortium (16 St. George's Place, Dymchurch Road, Palmarsh, Hythe, Kent CT21 6NE, England). Their first issue .(August, 1977) is a six-page, mimeographed buttetin with printed cover. Its primary goal is to report UFO sightings in the Kent area, as well as paranormal happenings. A rather well- done publication with good drawings illustrating some interesting UFO reports. The subscription price is 38 pence (about 75$) for four issues, although payment in the form of four International Reply Coupons will be accepted. Send to the editor, D. J. Parry, at the above address. - The September (Vol. 1, No. 1) issue of UFO Update is devoted largely to UFO photos, with several examples being repoduced. There is also a report on a landing trace case from Brantford, Ontario, Canada and various other items of interest. This is a nicely- produced magazine which shows promise of becoming a leading Canadian publication. It is published 9 times per year for a subscription rate of $9.00 ($1.25 for single copies). The editor is Tom Grey (573 North Service Road #402, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada L5A 1B6). - A new Italian- produced magazine, UFO phenomena, is to be published annually at a cost of $10.00 per issue. It has an impressive editorial board, consisting of leading researchers from all parts of the world. Volume 1, Number 1 (1976) contains articles by Miguel Guasp, Richard F. Haines, R. Leo Sprinkle, Ernst Berger and Roberto Doretti and Roberto Farabone. The publication attempts to be ultra-scientific in its approach to the UFO.subject, but I fear it may only succeed in being dull. While the first issue is 118 pages in length, I feel it is grossly overpriced at $10.00. With some changes, UFO Phenomena might take its place with other leading UFO periodicals, but I doubt that it will ever make it if it continues its present course.

NASA is trying to figure out if any UFO research is even needed and is not too happy about spending time on letters.\" NASA still has not released a public statement detailing their future plans in this respect. MUFON personnel have both met in Washington, D.C. with the principals involved and have received answere to correspondence offering MUFON's services. Letters have been sent to the following NASA administrators who are in a position to either direct or influence the action NASA will take in this regard: Dr. Robert Frosch, NASA Administrator; Edward P.

He utilized this routing to have a written proposal to President Carter delivered to Frank Press, Scientific Advisor to the President. Several responses have been received to date with more anticipated from NASA officials or members of the President's staff. Herbert J. Rowe, NASA Associate Administrator for External Affairs in a letter dated October 27,1977 replied to Paul Cerny in the following manner: \"This is in response to your recent identical letters addressed to Dr. Frosch, Dr. Henry and to me. At the present time our investigation of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) phenomena is to be limited to a review of the literature to see whether any further investigation should be conducted. At this time, we have no resources or staff available to conduct infield investigations or to direct any infield investigations. 'Should we arrive at the point where outside assistance is desired, we will be in touch with you.\" During a private briefing in Washington, D.C. at NASA headquarters, a MUFON researcher was told by Dr. Richard C Henry, presently Deputy Director of the Astrophysics Program Code SA for NASA, that he has been selected as the Project Officer for the UFO assignment. Dr. Henry has had a long interest in the UFO phenomena, therefore, his selection for this important role could have significant positive results. In keeping with NASA's initial step-to review the literature, we have mailed copies of the 1975, 1976 and 1977 MUFON UFO Symposium Proceedings to Dr. > Henry and offered our assistance. Letters to Dr. Henry, offering encouragement in this study,.would now be appropriate to counteract negative influences being exerted by Phil Klass, and Robert Schaeffer. Dr. Henry's complete address is: Dr. Richard C. Henry, Deputy Director Astrophysics Program Code SA NASA Headquarters Washington, DC 20546 To facilitate reading and reviewing the literature and \"skimming through the UFO cases\" for the past ten years, Retired A:F. General Chapman was placed in charge. He immediately made an appeal to NASA for money and manpower in order to perform this function. , : The November and December issues of The MUFON UFO Journal will have, follow-up stories on NASA's participation in this UFO investigation and the' degree in which they will be involved. When the October issue of the Journal went to press, Dr. Dave Williamson, NASA assistant for special projects, had this statement. \"We're not anxious to do it because we're not sure what we can do. It's my personal opinion that it's not wise to do research on something that is not a measurable phenomena. Spending .public money for such research is questionable. There is no measurable UFO evidence such as a piece of metal, flesh or cloth. We don't even have any radio signals. A photograph is not a measurement... Give me one little green; man-not a theory or memory of one - and we can have a multimillion dollar program. It's a scientific dilemma. How do you prove something that doesn't exist?\".'

The weekend of December 3 and 4, 1977, marked the date for the \"1 er CONGRESO NACIONAL DE UFOLOGIA\" (First National Congress on UFOology) in Barcelona, Spain. Some of the speakers and organizers who are MUFON members or JOURNAL subscribers participating were IgnacioDarnaude, Vincent-Juan Ballester Olmes, Antonio Ribera, Miguel Guasp, and friends such as Andreas Faber Kaiser, and Fabio Zerpa. Confirmed speakers for the Ninth Annual MUFON UFO SYMPOSIUM to be held July 29 and 30, 1978 at the Dayton Convention Center in Dayton, Ohio are Ted Bloecher, Ray Fowler, Richard Hall, Major Donald Keyhqe and Leonard Stringfield.

When Reader's Digest magazine assigned one of their Roving Editors, Ronald Schiller, to write a UFO article for this prestigious publication, some of us who had appointments to meet with Ron were elated. After Mr. Schiller spent an evening interviewing your director in MUFON's administrative office, it was apparent that his tour across the United States started in the wrong place. The title of the featured story \"Three UFOs-How Real Were They?\" in the November, 1977 issue provided a clue that his original goal was influenced negatively by Phil Klass. When Ron arrived in Sequin, Texas, his major interest was MUFON's evaluation of what we considered to be the five most well documented UFO cases. A telephone call to the twelve leading ufologists would have sufficed had we known that his first interview with Phil Klass, whose only claim to fame is that of being the nation's leading UFO debunker. If Ronald Schiller had indeed intended to write a legitimate UFO article, the \"brainwashing\" that he received from Mr. Klass destroyed any such possibility. The Editors of Reader's Digest have done a grave injustice to their readers by allowing a man of Phil Klass' reputation in the UFO field to exert such an influence over one of their roving editors, that they would print distorted facts, untruths, and gross illogical reasoning in a magazine read by millions all over the world. It is possible that Mr. Schiller already had preconceived ideas on the subject, therefore, he was an easy target for Phil Klass' unscientific investigations and distorted explanations. Personally, I believe Ron accepted the assignment from his editors in all sincerity, but the first leg of his nationwide tour took him from Pleasantville, NY to Washington, D.C. Had this sequence been reversed, Reader's Digest readers might have been treated to an unbiased, factual story on some of the best current UFO cases in this country. The timing of this article would have been excellent to help bolster NASA's decision to become deeply involved in the UFO study and would have complimented the movie \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\". It is disheartening to believe that one \"debunker\"might be able to cast his influence upon millions of people in such a negative manner. Anyone familiar with the three selected cases can recognize the falacies and unfounded logic that was utilized to explain the cases. However, the mass public has not had the privilege or opportunity to be exposed to the facts, therefore, they will tend to accept the written word in Reader's Digest. This could be a giant step backward for UFO research at a time when conditions are ripe for making positive strides forward. Prayerfully, I hope that intelligent people will be able \"to read between the lines\", especially in the Lawrence Coyne helicopter case. In a personnal debate between Phil Klass and myself at the Fort Smith UFO Conference, a \"fireball from the shower of Orionid meteors occurring precisely at this time of the year and hour of the night\" is typical of his illogical explanations, since the object was in view of the four man crew for 5.5 minutes. I interviewed Major Lawrence Coyne by telephone shortly after their sighting was publicized in the press. For JOURNAL readers who would like a thorough investigation on the Coyne case, I recommend the outstanding report written by Jennie Zeidman, titled \"UFO-Helicopter Close Encounter Over Ohio\" that was published in Flying Saucer Review, Volume 22 No. 4 in 1976 pages 15 through 19. 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"(Continued from page 15) entered the investigation it was already apparent that all such reports were mechanical hoax,, devices, some ingenious and some very simple, which had been placed as pranks.

However, it is clear from the official FBI directive that Hoover wanted the agents to be able to investigate aU reports. As will be seen in the next installment, the attempt by the Air Force to limit the FBI to certain kinds of UFO investigations resulted in a minor intelligence \"scandal\" which was followed shortly by the decision to end official FBI investigation. The interview with Gen. Schulgen indicated a considerable interest in UFO reports on the part of the Army Air Force Intelligence. Moreover, it is clear that the Air Force felt that something real was being observed. The AF was even allowing for the possibility that some \"flying objects might be a celestial phenomenon\", although there was no mention of the thought that extraterrestrial intelligence could be involved. It is especially interesting to learn that Gen. Schulgen himself interviewed an Air Corps pilot (name not given in the FBI file) who claimed, even under intense interrogation, that he had seen a disc. The \"behind the scenes\" interest by the AF is to be contrasted with the public statements in early July, 1947 that there were not enough facts to warrant further investigations, even though the Air Material Command (AMC) intended to investigate the matter more thoroughtly(io). The public disparagement of the reports by Kenneth Arnold and by other early UFO reporters is to be contrasted with the apparent acceptance by Gen. Schulgen of the reality of the phenomenon, especially after the report by the Air Corps pilot. Thus it appears that from the outset the AF investigation of UFO reports was done on two levels. Publically the AF tried to downplay the sightings, while privately the AF enlisted the help of other intelligence agencies in order to determine the nature of the phenomenon. As becomes apparent from the FBI file, the AF continued its undercover investigations even during the periods of time when it publically stated that it had no interest and was not investigating as, for example, in 1950. Inasmuch as UFO investigations were treated as a security manner and that therefore all internal documents were classified, it is not surprising that civilian investigators in the 1950's concluded that the AF was hiding evidence and began to refer to public AF statements (and later to Project Blue Book) as part of a \"cover-up\" of UFO information. Although there is no evidence in the FBI file (at least in the portion I have) that the Air Force actually had hard evidence (e.g., a crashed saucer), it is clear that there were reports involving military personnel that were so detailed that one had to choose between attributing the report to a real unknown phenomenon, probably a \"machine\", or else to the temporary mental breakdown of one or more military personnel while on duty. It seems to me that the reluctance to accept the second explanation of disc sightings was what ultimately kept the AF investigating. Further information on the AF investigation as seen through the \"eyes\" of the FBI will be presented in forthcoming papers. BIBLIOGRAPHY 1. D. Havekost, private communication. (D.
