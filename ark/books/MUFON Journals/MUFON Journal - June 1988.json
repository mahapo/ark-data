FROM THE EDITOR Not to paraphrase a contemporary bumper sticker of scatalogical content, but faux pas do happen. In this case you will notice the absence of Walter Webb's regular \"Night Sky\" column. My sincere apologies, since it's wholly my fault it's missing this month, to both Mr. Webb and our readers who have come to rely on it for up to date information on the whereabouts and doings of the heavenly bodies. Space permitting, we will include it next month to keep both the calendar and historical record straight. Science and technology, religion and magic, would seem to be separate pigeonholes and never the twain shall meet. But a cursory glance at the cover this month tells you this is not the case, at least not where UFOs and the Journal intersect. In fact, we have a rather lively forum this issue in which all manner of philosophical, spiritual and scientific speculation is allowed free roam. We're not aiming to make converts here to any particular cause, but rather to referee what otherwise might be considered an unwieldly contest between opponents who don't usually square off in the same ring. But if the UFO subject is anything, it's encompassing. Choose up sides, by all means, which is what such forums are for. And let us hear your own thoughts on the matter.

The following article was first presented as a contrib- uted paper at last summer's MUFON Symposium in Washing- ton, D.C. ABSTRACT Nobody really knows what UFOs are or what so-called \"intelligence\" controls them. There is something of a pattern in the various UFO-related phenomena, but it has no resemb- lance to a scientific reconnaissance of planet earth and its inhabitants by extraterrestrials. A more logical as- sumption is that the mysterious UFO intelligence understands human psy- chology quite well and is staging events to produce the responses it desires. The primary goal of the UFO intelligence is to undermine and des- troy the authority and legitimacy of existing institutions in the minds of the masses. There is no desire to communicate or establish relations with the various governmental, reli- gious, or scientific institutions or with any of the prominent individuals in them. Every part of the UFO pheno- menon is designed to erase the mes- sianic faiths and scientific rationalism and replace them with magic, anim- ism, and paganism. This behavior pattern is made even clearer by the most recently released (three in 1987) UFO books. INTRODUCTION What do we really know about UFOs? Not very much. But at this point in time it is reasonable to assume that somebody or something is in possession of unusual advanced technology and is using it in a way quite different from what we expect from commercial, diplomatic, or mil- itary organizations. How this technology is being used is one of the few really reliable pieces MUFON UFO Journal, No. 242, JUNE 1988 of information we do have. There are no \"testable hypotheses,\" or at least none available to the civilian UFO research community with its limited resources. The problem is more one of detective work than classical science. Our object of study is not inanimate matter or life of limited intelligence, but something that is mentally superior to most of us, if not all of us. Adding to the complexity, we have certain parts of the govern- ment and scientific community as adversaries, as well as the UFO intel- ligence itself. There is no easy way to distinguish between hoaxes and actual events. This is because, in some sense, all UFO events are hoaxes. That is, they are staged to create some impression on the observers. Even hoaxes created by people of modest means and talents have cost a lot of investigative effort. When one considers that gov- ernments or other authorities with considerable resources may be creat- ing false sightings just to be able to discredit them later, the situation seems hopeless. UFO CHALLENGE When I started this paper it was before I had heard of, let alone read, any of the three recent books that have put UFOs back on the best- seller lists (see References). Two of these are of American origin and con- cern alleged abductions and one was written by an American about alleged contacts of a Swiss with extraterres- trials visually indistinguishable from Caucasian humans. Nothing has changed with the publication of these books; it is more of the same. But quantity does make a difference. Despite apparent differences, both types of events have given too little in- formation to make a rational decision. So-called \"investigations\" have only served to increase the level of uncer- tainty and confusion. This is the most persistent aspect of the whole UFO phenomenon, which has been going on for 40 years, or 40,000 years, according to some observers. If the only piece of reliable information you have about something is that none of the information you have is reliable, what do you know? Let us suppose there is a genuine source of UFO phenomena, not hal- lucinations, psychological aberrations, or misidentification of unfamiliar ob- jects, such as the planet Venus. What does it accomplish by never permit- ting itself to be positively identified? It accomplishes exactly what every sort of espionage or criminal operation hopes to achieve. One cannot defend oneself effectively from what can't be seen, or at least can't be found read- ily. The KGB, the CIA, the Mafia - all expend considerable resources and ingenuity trying to be invisible, but effective. \"BILLY\" MEIER There are a number of strange things about the alleged \"Billy\" Meier contacts, for example, that no one seems to have noticed. • Would higher intelligences travel hundreds of light years to be photo- graphed with a camera that is not only cheap, but broken? Couldn't beings capable of building flying sauc- ers repair an inexpensive Japanese camera? NASA takes better care of its photo gear than Meier's Pleiadeans. • \"The negatives are second genera- tion.\" Copying color films does funny things that require no special equip- ment to notice. Contrast goes up. Colors shift to either the extremes of pure primaries or very muddy browns. This happens because the three lay- ers do not have a flat frequency response and a sharp cut-off and the transmission of the dyes does not exactly match the frequency response. 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"This cannot be corrected in normal pho- tographic printing or in the making of color separations for offset printing. The only way to correct it is by dig- itizing the image, filtering the image digitally, and reprinting it using lasers. A small number of labs in the U.S. do provide this sort of service, Laserco- lor, in Florida, for example. But their usual product is a medium format color negative made from a 35 mm slide. There is no conventional pro- cess for duplicating color negatives. None of the reproductions I have seen of the Meier photos has a color balance outside the normal range for Agfa products, so if these are made from copied negatives, the copying was done very well. The conclusion is that either Meier's negatives are not being stolen and replaced by copies, or this is being done by an intelli- gence agency or other well-endowed organization with an exceptional in- house photo lab (Cf. Elders and Welch, 1980). • One more conclusion is possible and always was possible: Meier has or had collaborators with considera- ble resources. There is no certain evidence what technical capabilities these collaborators have. But even if they are extraterrestrials, I would doubt they come from the Pleiades or ever have been there or that anything they have told Meier is in any way true. ABDUCTIONS, ANYONE? There isn't much to go on in the abduction cases either. Anonymous witnesses with scars and strange sto- ries are not a firm basis for rendering a judgement. I doubt the FBI would start an investigation, even if the request were made. The whole thing could be a hoax perpetrated by a government operation with or without the cooperation of the witnesses. There is one argument against that. The governments of the world want people to forget about UFOs. They hope the things will just go away. If abductions have any purpose, it is to remind people that UFOs are still around and not as easy to ignore as exotic and illegal aircraft. Are the \"bug people\" hybridizing themselves with human beings? Are The universe of UFOs is animistic. Exotic celestrial beings travel from world to world. Life is every- where and more diverse than in the Hindu pantheon. Some authors have suggested that UFOnauts with insect-like body struc- tures might be able to withstand the observed high accelerations displayed by some UFOs. This is a very dub- ious conclusion. Insects can with- stand high accelerations, jump out of proportion to their size, and fly because of their small size, not because of the exoskeletons. Objects do have a scale, especially organisms, because the weight of an object is proportional to the cube of its length (i.e., volume(, but its strength is pro- portional to the square (cross-section- al area). The largest insects known to palentologists were only about a foot long. An insect the size of a small man would be too heavy to move itself. Its organs would be more weakly supported than ours. If the bug people are real, they cer- tainly have endoskeletons of some sort. But could they hybridize with human beings? It is hard to say for sure. The rule of thumb is that races can produce hybrids, but species cannot. In some borderline cases ste- rile hybrids are produced. Mules and seedless grapes are both familiar to us. How does this work in the case of human beings or humanoids? Surpris- ingly little is known, since the medical professional specializes in repairs, not preventive action. We do know that the great American \"melting pot\" is an orthodontist's paradise. Jaws don't fit properly and the teeth don't fit in the gums either. Could this be due to nutrition? Starving Africans usually have hard, straight teeth. Children of middle-class nutrition freaks are more likely to need the orthodontist than ghetto dwellers. Other populations notorious for bad teeth include the lower classes in Brazil and England. Bug people look like Caspar Gump; they have no jaws at all. If hybrids are possible, the problems they might have would be formidable. More subtle but deadly problems can occur in hybrids, especially of genetically distant types. Sometimes the metabolism does not work well. A number of natural creatures have developed distinctive breeding habits or peculiar sex organs to prevent debilitating hybridizations. On the other hand, \"Kathie Davis\" seems to have a below-average medical history (Hopkins, 1987). There also are things like Rh fac- tors. These can be fatal for offspring when all else seems very compatible. Without treatment, death of the fetus is caused by immune reactions. With advanced technology, the bug people might be able to read and interpret the entire genetic map of a sperm or egg cell and select ones that work. Or they might be able to take the genes or chromosomes they need. But at this level of picking and choosing, they would not need humans or other very closely related crea- tures. These things are protein struc- tures that are not species- or individual- specific. Even our relatively new and possible primitive genetic engineering mixes genetic coding material from various phyla, as well as species. What are the bug people really doing then? They are letting a very few people know for sure that they are here. If we believe Whitley Strieber (1987), they have even enlisted a public relations agent. Like \"Billy\" Meier's friends, however, they have not given the world unassailable evidence of their presence (Kinder, 1987). The supposed hybrids can be given a very sinister interpretation simply by looking at American cultural his- tory. Many Americans claim to have a very small part-Indian ancestry. In many cases this is entirely mythical and in most others it would not pro- duce anything that could be detected by a physical anthropologist. Myth or fact, the purpose of such tales is MUFON UFO Journal, No. 242, June 1988"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"merely to justify in one's own mind the theft of the native Americans' land and the destruction of their cul- ture. Would aliens play the same game with us? WHAT IS THE STRATEGY? Whether UFOs are real or not, they have divided the world into two camps: believers and non believers. Some of the believers are more criti- cal than others, but that's true about every issue. If UFOs are real, the believers include select people in the intelligence community and perhaps a few top military personnel and politi- cians, and certainly the \"professional debunkers,\" whose crusades for scien- tific skepticism are far in excess of the requirement. The only identifiable thing the UFO phenomenon is doing is discrediting the scientific and political establish- ments, especially with witnesses and abductees. So far, the situation is very ignorable. Thousands of people disappear every year due to many causes. Even if 10% of these were taken away by UFOs, it would be insignificant. Violent crime and auto- mobile accidents are much greater dangers to people middle-aged and younger. It's the nature of UFOs that make it a significant factor, not its statistical likelihood. We also can say that UFOs want to be seen. They seem to have the technology required to perform most any mission undetected, if they wanted it to be that way. Abductions could be performed under general anesthe- sia. The only certain purpose of the abductions is to be remembered. Scars and pains may reinforce that memory. But there is no reason to believe what is recalled was not staged only for the purpose of being remembered. WHAT IS THE ISSUE? If the UFO phenomenon were just a purely scientific curiosity, there would be no easy way to resolve it. This is true of most scientific efforts, which often cost millions and even bil- lions of dollars and require years of work to resolve. What is at issue in these investigations is technical pro- MUFON UFO Journal, No. 242, JUNE 1988 gress — new products and processes — new weapons — national prestige. The issue over UFOs is quite dif- ferent from that of scientific research and is the most fundamental one for any society. What is at stage is legi- timacy. WHAT IS LEGITIMACY? What purpose does religion serve? A standard answer used to be that religion gave some explanation of the natural world and of the origins of man and society. This was partly true and is still partly true, but not very important. The most important func- tion of any religion is to justify the prevailing political and social sys- tems. Religion uses myths and convo- luted reasoning, along with history and popular inertia to do this. In return the state church receives sub- sidies and other favors from the rul- ing establishment. Ruling classes, we should note, include more than hered- itary nobility. Ours, for example, is an open-access meritocracy, mostly \"lib- eral\" lawyers. In tribal societies and homogene- ous city-states with very formal class structures this is easy to compre- hend. The development of pluralistic empires and messianic faiths has made modern times very complex. To satisfy political needs, these"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"would-be world religions have had to break down into denominations. Starting as early as the last decades of the 18th century, science began to replace the messianic faiths as the source of legitimacy, just as these faiths had replaced the pagan gods of earlier times. There are at least as many foibles in the doctrines of scien- tific Marxism and democratic capital- ism as there ever were in theocracy, but our goal is not to detail these. All we want to say is that \"freedom of religion\" was only a sign that religion, as traditionally understood, was no longer important, not that men were more free. Big Science is our State Church. We all must learn its cate- chisms, which none of us understand, and pay for its exotic temples with our taxes. CONCLUSIONS Are aliens from outer space, or whoever controls UFOs and abduc- tions, more honest and straightfor- ward than politicians, bureaucrats, scientists, lawyers, doctors or union leaders? To think so is a very exotic form of naivete. As Richard Nixon told civil rights leaders, \"Don't listen to what we say, look at what we do.\" So what do they do? They do serve to discredit the scientific estab- lishment and the political system in the eyes of the masses. But there are several dozen other things that do a much better job of this. .People fear science and technology and have lost faith in institutions all over the world and the incremental effect of UFOs on this is just about negligible. What UFOS do offer that is unique is an alternative. God is dead and Marxism is a failure and the only candidate for higher beliefs is in UFO intelligence. UFOs fit in better with ancient human thought patterns and folk tra- ditions than do modern science and the messianic faiths. Science is too incomprehensible. Even most scient- ists don't know what's going on out- side their own limited specialty. The gap between the technical and the popular literature is enormous, though filled somewhat inadequately by Ameri- can Scientist and Scientific American. The image of science and scientists is cold, impersonal, indifferent. The Gods of the messianic faiths are similarly removed from human understanding and human feeling. God is so omnipotent it is difficult to understand why he tolerates Satan and sin. And he is so omniscient that he should know which of us will suc- cumb to the Devil's temptations and who will not. Once you concede an infinite power and intelligence, you become like the creators of Super- man, for whom it is impossible to write a meaningful plot. The messia- nic faiths spread among people who had lost their tribal-derived identities to serfdom and feudalism. UFOnauts are more like the magi- cal beings of paganism and animism. Bug people are very much like fairies and elves. The \"beautiful people\" are still more controversial, even in the UFO community. But these celestial beings come down and converse with all sorts of people on a regular basis. Even Moses didn't get much time with God! The universe of science is mostly dead and mechanical. Some scientists insist life, let alone intelligent life, exists only on earth. The most optim- istic think there may be other civiliza- tions out there and we may even be able to converse with them, but with the handicap of decades-long pauses. The universe of UFOs is animistic. Exotic celestial beings travel from world to world. Life is everywhere and more diverse than in the Hindu pantheon. These very old beliefs did not first arise from UFO stories, but seeped into popular culture with fan- tasy and science fiction tales. Ancient gods once banished to the calendar, astronomy, and the constellations suddenly came to life as costly NASA projects. Freud and many other scientists of his generation thought that religion would gradually disappear, as science explained one mystery after another. Were they totally wrong? Have an- cient gods come back with science and technology to reclaim the human mind and spirit? Who is staging these experiences. And why? REFERENCES Elders, Lee J. and Thomas F.

POSTSCRIPT The various presentations given at the 1987 MUFON Symposium, par- ticularly those of Whitley Strieber, \"Bill\" Moore, and Stanton Friedman, indicate that the issues raised in this paper are rapidly reaching a critical point. The inner sanctum of govern- ment seems to be releasing gradually and carefully more and more of its arcane secrets. The number of wit- nesses and abductees may be ap- proaching the critical mass needed to precipitate a massive panic of the type caused by Orson Welle's famous \"Invasion from Mars\" radio broadcast in 1938. Discussions with a climate expert after the Symposium have confirmed that the concerns of Strieber and his \"friends\" are very serious. I can recall over the past decade that my con- tacts in the environmental movement estimated that 30 more years of \"growth and progress\" would collapse the earth's life support systems. Per- haps they were too optimistic — some of our own scientists now think sol- Financial and economic collapse are relentlessly enveloping both the capitalist and socialist nations. Rarely does just one thing go wrong! A theory is only as good as its pre- dictions, so here it is: As the faith of the world's people in their leaders and their institutions spirals toward the nadir, more and more revelations about UFOs will be made. This is what the 40-year wait has been antic- ipating, and the climax may be reached by the end of 1988. © 1987 Turtle Hollow Associates, Inc.

It also reached the top spot in hardcover sales last spring. A sequel, Trans- formation, is scheduled for publi- cation this fall, and a movie ver- sion of Communion is presently in the works. I am writing in part in response to your brief mention in the March issue of the interview I did with Twilight Zone magazine and in part to react to my critics within the UFO commun- ity. First, I think that we all have to accept that there will be subtle debunking efforts like the TZ piece. By adroit editing and the liberal use of exclamation points the interviewer made me seem as \"off the wall\" as possible. I was not given the chance to see the interview beforehand, and every effort was expended on distort- ing my rather mild statements as much as possible. There are things about the TZ interview that bear comment. In it I stated that I \"don't necessarily think I was abducted aboard a spacecraft by extraterrestrials ...\" Omitted was the phrase, \"but I'd be very surprised if I wasn't.\" The sentence \"Something else may have happened — I'm not sure what\" should have read \"Some- thing else may have happened, but if it did I'm not sure what it could have been.\" I do not know exactly what the interviewer had on tape. The fact remains that he did not extend to me the courtesy that was promised, which was a chance to correct the transcription. Since he was at that time a friend, I did not speak into the tape recorder with my usual care. I assumed that I was getting another crack at the typescript. MUFON UFO Journal, No. 242, JUNE 1988 If anybody cares what I really think, read the interview in the latest issue of UFO (formerly California UFO) It is definitive. There is a terrific strain in my rela- tionship with the UFO community, and I don't wish to make any secret of it. I am still contributing to the Fund for UFO Research, primarily because of my respect for Bruce Maccabee, but my relationships with many UFO researchers are not good. This is why: 1. Too many UFO researchers believe the Budd Hopkins \"abduction scenario,\" assuming it to be holy writ. It is quite possibly part of what is happening, but it isn't the whole story. I have received literally thou- sands of narratives from people who have never been hypnotized and never been near a UFO researcher. If even a small percentage of their sto- ries are true, then the Hopkins sce- nario cannot be the whole answer. I suspect that it is deeply distorted but I cannot yet prove that. 2. There seems to be a real desire for the phenomenon to be a visit from another planet by nuts-and-bolts craft piloted by people pretty much like us, just less emotional, smarter and meaner. (Is that possible??) That isn't satisfactory to me. Something much more complex is happening. 3. There are a large number of researchers out there hypnotizing people. But these researchers have no mental health credentials. That worries me. What's worse, they mostly seem to believe the Hopkins scena- rio, which is very frightening. I believe that much \"abduction research\" is actually unintentional brainwashing and accidental imposition of narratives on hypnosis. Its effect is to leave already troubled people in much worse shape. I feel that it's only a matter of time before somebody is hurt, either driven psychotic or to suicide, and I feel that is very unfortunate. 4. Running through the commun- \"Communion did more for the cause of the UFO community than anything that has hap- pened in the past quar- ter century.\" ity there is a real undercurrent of jealous hatred of me that I find fright- ening but not surprising. It emerges out of the inescapable fact that many people have spent their lives at this, and I have come along and in a few months made more money than they have ever dreamed of while in the pro- cess of stealing their thunder. This is the truth, and I don't know of any- thing I can do to make them feel better. 5. There is also a lot of fear that I will discredit the carefully constructed reputation of the \"abductees\" as a sober lot telling a consistent and believable story. I may indeed do this. I intend to report my perceptions accurately and my frequent befud- dlement and confusion with total candor. I am not interested in whether or not I am believed. I am interested in telling the truth as best I can. People are also going to have to realize that I am a highly imaginative person, and that the combination of this fact plus the extraordinary stran- geness of what is happening to me means that I am bound to distort my perceptions from time to time. I feel that it is my responsibility to tell the truth as best I can, even if I must admit to a lot of confusion about my past and a lot of unsure- ness about what is really happening during visitor encounters in the pres- ent. There is confusion. Inevitably. I am also a very acute observer, so the distortions may not be all that great. As a matter of fact, I suspect 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"that the believable, understandable, neatly constructed narrative of the typical abduction scenario emerging out of UFO researchers' hypnosis efforts is more distorted than the stranger tales. It seems to me that it is more a reflection of the expecta- tions of researchers and subjects than of reality. There has been a great deal of \"Strieber bashing\" in the past year. I would ask people to reflect on the service I performed in publishing Communion before they vent their frustrations on me. I did not steal my success, I earned it, and have the right to be treated with respect. My book did more for the cause of the UFO community than anything that has happened in the past quarter century. As far as the accuracy and veracity of my story are concerned, I would direct readers to look at the illustra- tion of the \"bedroom visitor\" from the Gulf Breeze case that appears on page 8 of the March, 1988 MUFON Journal, and then read the descrip- tion of the first visitor I saw on the night of December 26, 1985. It is obvious that Ed and I saw the same thing. It is also noteworthy that both Ed and I were armed at the time we saw the shielded visitors. He also reported an odor with a cinnamon undertone connected with the vis- itors, as did his wife. I also smelled this smell when I was taken. Ed has reported that he knew almost nothing about Communion when he had his experience. The interactions he has described with the visitors (the pictures they have shown him in his mind) represent to me a coherent communication. I understand the meaning of what he was shown. I doubt that I will ever be able to communicate my understanding to . him. Unless he does understand cor- rectly, it would surprise me to see his experience deepen. And the chance for face-to-face contact and confirma- tion that is obviously there will be lost. It is sad that he will inevitably be exposed to abduction researchers who will hypnotize him into believing some version of the typical abduction scenario. And the truth of what is happening will be lost in an artificially constructed narrative, which may or may not have any relationship to reality. The UFO community might be on the right track. But there has been a failure both of objectivity and obser- vation. Things are stranger than you realize, or want to believe. Stranger, more terrible ... also more beautiful. Ufologists And the Extraterrestrial Hypothesis By Jerome Clark Jerome Clark edits Fate Magazine. A leading UFO researcher of long standing, his contributions and publications in the field are exten- sive. Jenny Randies is a good friend, an esteemed colleague and a valued con- tributor to International UFO Repor- ter, of which I am editor. Even good friends, however, must be called to task when they say something dumb. My friends have never hesitated to do that when I do, and so I do not hesi- tate to respond to an unfair and unfounded assertion Jenny makes in her article \"Do We Now Have Two Ufologies?\" (MUFON UFO Journal, April 1988). Jenny begins by saying, reasonably enough, that it is the possibility that UFOs are of extraterrestrial origin that makes ufology interesting to most ufologists. That no-doubt-true (if banal) observation having been made, she abruptly sails off into the wild blue yonder (the same place occupied by CSICOP chairman Paul Kurtz, 8 who has never been accused of knowing much about UFOs or ufol- ogy; see his hilarious treatment of the subject in The Transcendental Temp- tation) on these words: \"...the vast majority [of ufologists], even when they deny it thrice until the cock crows, really have an inner longing to see their belief vindicated that UFOs are advanced alien visitors who have come here, will change the world and maybe help us get out of the mess we are in.\" One would expect this of someone who, like Kurtz, is unversed in ufol- ogy and unacquainted with ufoldgists but looking to say something nasty about the subject and its practition- ers. That it comes from Jenny Ran- dies — and that she further confesses \"that's true of me\" — is pretty dis- heartening. That she claims, further, to be able to read our minds (those of us who \"deny it thrice until the cock crows\" •, — huh? — are only hid- ing our deep, secret thoughts, appar- ently inaccessible even to us, if not to Jenny) is downright strange. I have been interested in UFOs for three decades and have interacted for nearly as long with ufologists. In the thousands of hours I have spent in conversation and correspondence with my colleagues, I have never heard a single mainstream ufologist, even when he was confiding to me beliefs or speculations that he would not com- mit to print, express the view, hope or delusion that UFOs are here to save us. That does not mean, of course, that out there somewhere there isn't somebody who harbors that belief, but it is a distinctly rare view, far removed from the mental universe of the average mainstream ufologist. To the overwhelming majority of ufologists, the investigation of the UFO phenomenon is not anything remotely like a religious pursuit. Indeed, in the UFO literature there is nothing to sustain a religious interpretation. The UFO evidence, if it tells us any- thing about the attitudes of the pre- sumed alien intelligences, informs us that the (alleged) ETs are mostly or MUFON UFO Journal, No. 242, June 1988"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"entirely indifferent to our welfare. An excellent summary of what abduction accounts — the reports that ostensi- bly give us a close-up view of aliens and their habits — seem to be reveal- ing about the nature of the UFO intelligences appears in Budd Hop- kins' \"What They're Doing to Us\" (IUR, September/October 1987). People who need to believe in extraterrestrials-as-saviors have always had a place to go, and that was not to ufology but to the contactee movement. That ufologists have long rejected the contactee message is in itself proof that religious interpreta- tions of the UFO evidence have played no part in their conclusion that such evidence suggests alien vis- itation. Religious historian J. Gordon Melton, an authority on the contactee movement, has written that contac- tees and their followers are \"partici- pants in an occult religious move- ment,\" whereas ufologists are \"secular scientists\" with an entirely separate set of concerns. Ufologists take the extraterrestrial hypothesis seriously because a body of apparently solid evidence supports that interpretation. Religious impulses invisible to everyone but Randies and Kurtz are unnecessary explanations for ufologists' motives. Perhaps if there were no McMinnville photos, no Trans-en-Provence CE2, no Ros- well incident, no radar-visual epi- sodes, no any number-of-other-well- documented cases, interest in UFOs as possibly alien devices could be ascribed solely to nonrational motives. Because such cases exist, because they have so far resisted explanation, because they can be reasonably (even if it should turn out incorrectly) inter- preted as suggestive of visitation fronv elsewhere, there are no grounds for questioning the motives or rationality of those of us who think the extrater- restrial hypothesis merits consideration. Of course human beings are never entirely rational. Even scientists admit that their interest in their particular disciplines is motivated by personal concerns, profound or trivial, in addi- tion to cold intellectual curiosity. None of us has the personality of a computer, after all. So, to the extent that ufologists have a nonrational motive for their interest, it is probably MUFON UFO Journal, No. 242, JUNE 1988 a simple sense of novelty. UFOs are exciting, unusual, puzzling — in other words, far more interesting than the mundane concerns of our daily lives. People of a curious bent — or people simply seeking refuge from boredom — are attracted to mysteries, and UFOs represent a mystery with a potentially thrilling answer (as do, for that matter, all kinds of \"respectable\" scientific mysteries). But that \"thril- ling answer,\" Jenny's claim notwith- standing, is visitation, not salvation, from outer space, and ufologists seek evidence, not mystical revelation, as they try to determine whether or not such visitation is occurring. There is much to criticize about the way some\" ufologists conduct their business, but it is unfair and untrue to charge they are secret religious fanatics. That is an accusation with- out evidence. In fact, it is demonstra- bly false. Elsewhere in her article Jenny writes that abductions \"do not get filmed ... There aren't even any cred- ible pictures of aliens in nonabduction situations.\" This is meant, I guess, to mean that the reality of these events is suspect. There are legitimate criti- cisms to be made of the physical interpretation of abduction reports, but this is not one of them. Abduc- tions and CE3s are sudden, unex- pected and terrifying events, in com- mon, for example, with criminal assault— and how many muggings and murders in progress have been filmed? Jenny's is no argument at all. It might be argued that the attempt by some ufologists to treat abduc- tions as something somehow separate from the rest of the UFO pheno- menon is simply a latter-day expres- sion of the impulse, once indulged by the ufologists of an earlier period, to reject CE3s entirely. (Younger read- ers may not remember — or believe — this, but there was a time when many mainstream ufologists would have nothing to do with even nonab- duction CE3s.) After all, CE3s and abductions have even more disturb- ing and unpleasant implications than other UFO reports — which, if inter- preted in ET terms, suggest the operation of an overwhelming super- ior intelligence which can do anything with us that it wishes. If we want to get into the mind- reading business, maybe our psychic perceptions will tell us that people who reject CE3s, abductions and the ETH are doing so because — even when they deny it thrice until the cock crows — they have an inner terror of what extraterrestrial visita- tion may really mean and are desper- ately, and not always rationally, seek- ing a comfortable, nonthreatening alternative which reassures them that human beings and their gods are still the lords of this earth.

As a principal or secondary partici- pant in the investigation of more than thirty close encounter claims, the author has heard a number of recur- ring themes in encounter relations that seem to indicate a consistent pattern. It is the purpose of this paper to use these consistencies in the estab- lishment of a model experience to be called the Latent Encounter Expe- rience (more commonly known as an \"abduction\") and to elaborate on its stages. The model (Table 1) will be heuristic in the sense that it will sug- gest certain tests that may serve to modify the model itself. First, a word about terminology — the word \"abduction\" has, in the wri- ter's opinion, become distended and misshapen after so many months of nurture at the bosoms of the media. Indeed, as we all know, one debunker with no apparent understanding of the claims or claimants, has focused on the point that these \"abductions,\" having not been reported to the FBI, can't be taken seriously. Totally ig- nored is the fact that the vast major- ity of percipients have little or no immediate recollection of their expe- rience, and have enormous difficulties in later articulation (see the Table 3 summary of difficulties that typically must be overcome, in part or in total, by the percipient). \"Abduction\", of course, carries the notion of unwillingness and by impli- cation the notion of complete post- event memory. The writer's study of encounter claims, images, and memo- ries, indicates that the former is not always the case and the latter hardly ever the case. Use of the term \"latent encounter\", while having the disad- vantage of implying an experience, has the advantage of being neutral 10 By Joe Nyman enough to deter the sensationally inclined and sidestep meaningless arguments. To be most objective, since indis- putable verification is lacking, an even more neutral term would probably be better — on the order of \"latent encounter imagery\", implying some- thing hidden, something met, and mental associations linking the two. For convenience, however, the author will use \"Latent Encounter\", or \"LE\". Although some of the information used to prepare this model has come from the percipients' conscious mem- ory, most has been collected as the result of having claimants attempt to relive an unresolved experience. The setting used has been one in which the concerned individuals have been initially given suggestions causing them to relax, focus their attention and memory on the unresolved expe- rience, and then form a chain of associations to the unresolved expe- rience which might contribute to its resolution. After ten years of work with indi- viduals whose statements have been incorporated into this model, the wri- ter has gained some insight into their motivations and willingness to expose themselves and their lives to scrutiny and possible ridicule. In all cases but one (almost certainly a hoax) their major motives were judged to be: a) fear for their own sanity, although the great majority were functioning well in life, and b) the need to have an unresolved, puzzling experience ex- plained. Table 2 supplies an indication to the reader of how a number of per- cipients have reached the point of active investigation. With the above in mind, let's move forward to the proposed model and its stages. Table 1 is a summary representa- tion of the eight stages of the model. Associated with each stage number is a short descriptive characteristic. Stage The Latent Encounter Cycle Characterized by Memory or Image 1 Anxious anticipation of something unknown (forewarning). 2 Transition of consciousness from normal awake state. The transition is mostly from fear and terror to immediate calmness and acquiescence. 3 Psycho-physical imposition and interaction. 4 Overlay of positive feelings, reassurance. A sence of source and pur- pose given. 5 Transition of consciousness to normal waking. An aftersense of fear/plea- sure/happiness, lingers. 6 Rapid forgetfulness of most or all memory of experience. 7 Marker stage: what little is remembered is remembered as an incon- gruity, with unresolved conscious memories, repetitive dreams. 8 Cycle repetition at very specific ages. MUFON UFO Journal, No. 242, June 1988"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"STAGES Indications of the LE Cycle in the Percipient Let's now amplify each of these stages based on the author's investiga- tions. Sfage 1. The percipient experien- ces a subtle urge or prompting, as if originating from within, to: a) be in a certain location at a certain time, and b) expect something strangely familiar but yet unknown. This forewarning is usually accompanied by anxiety with no apparent source. Sfage 2. At the required place and time, the percipient experiences an unusual phenomenon followed by a transition in awareness such that the individual proceeds from a state of normal wakefulness with its concom- itant functions of volition, emotion, and memory to a state characterized by calmness, acquiescence, and limited mobility (what the author calls the CA state). There are consistent phys- ical and mental effects described by a number of percipients in this stage that the author will not elaborate on here. Sfage 3. This is the stage about which books are written and movies made. Rich with bizarre imagery, and emotion-filled, this stage is the most difficult for the percipient to relive. It is replete with images of mental communication, and involuntary sub- mission to physical procedures. This is the stage of the \"table\", the \"scar\", the \"needle\", the \"machine\", the \"probe\", etc. This is the stage of the \"ova\", and the \"sperm\", and the \"baby\"! Sfage 4. The physical procedures have been completed. The percipient is ready to return, but not before a positive bias is mentally imposed to be the lasting emotional remnant of the experience. This \"veneering\" can be a multi-part process involving \"recognition\", \"explanation\", and \"un- derstanding\". It can also include the projection of \"love\", the \"guided tour\", and the \"life review\". It is con- ducted by that entity who has the \"special relationship\" with the percip- ient. The nature of that relationship is beyond the scope of this paper. Sfage 5. In the case of an LE intersecting normal waking activity the transition from CA state to nor- mal can be, to use Budd Hopkins' MUFON UFO Journal, No. 242, JUNE 1988 1. Puzzlement — The percipient has been puzzled or upset by his/her marker experience(s) for months or years. 2. Puzzle Solving Action — The percipient has attempted to resolve the in- congruity without success. 3. Decision — The percipient has reached the point of needing to resolve the incongruity. 4. Readiness — The percipient is willing to come forward to find out what happened. Table 2. perfectly descriptive term, seamless. It seems as if there has been no intervening experience. Yet there re- mains an afterimage resulting from the emotional veneer imposed in Stage 4, a cover story to explain any- thing unusual or inconsistent resulting from the encounter itself. The afte- rimage includes a feeling of prohibi- tion against discussing or remember- ing any aspect of the experience. This last' extends to members of groups that have just shared an experience. The result: no exchange, no discussion, \"no happening\"! LE's proceeding from bedroom intru- sions end by returning the awakened sleeper to a state of sleep. The result- ing morning memory is one of unease or nightmare. Sfage 6. Within minutes of the Stage 5 waking transition, most, if not all, conscious memory of the encoun- ter has become latent in memory. As fleeting as a dream trace, the LE imagery is locked away and super- ceded by routine or sleep. Generally, the CA state leads back into the per- cipient's pre-encounter situation. Sfage 7. In most cases, and des- pite the positive veneering, an anxiety- provoking fragment remains. Some- times it is painted by memory to conform to an image the percipient finds more palatable and less threat- ening, other times it is a nameless fear or feeling of something unre- solved, an experience that the mind returns to over and over again with- out conscious resolution. More gener- ally, this signal in conscious memory, or marker memory, as the author likes to call it, is an incongruous image, accompanied by 'a nameless anxiety that appears to have no con- scious resolution, and which forces Difficulties in Bringing the LE to Memory 1. The percipient feels that if one admits to the experience it is an admission of one's own insanity. 2. If the percipient has enough conviction and strength of character to know that one is not insane, there is always the feeling that others may not be so kind. 3. The percipient wants to repress the trauma and helplessness of the exper- ience. 4. The percipient has difficulty in remembering something that took place in another state of awareness, much like the difficulty in remembering dreams. 5. The percipient has a feeling of prohibition — one shouldn't remember! Table 3. 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"itself to mind repetitively. This is the point from which investigations begin. Sfage 8. Continuing work has now made it clear that the individual LE is only one of a sequence of such expe- riences that take place at specific intervals in an individual's life. It is far from a random process! What has come very sharply into focus is that at least a portion of these specific intervals occur at ages that can be directly related to the formation and maturation of the human sexual func- tion! At this time it is probably not wise to publish these ages as a check to further case work. The interval between LE's is punc- tuated by claims of two types of exotic phenomena, one of which manifests objectively, but rarely, and the other of which is purely subjec- tive and seemingly continuous. The objective phenomenon manifests most- ly in telekinetic effects, while the purely subjective can be described as \"consciousness monitoring\" in which the percipients feel themselves to be \"observed\" and directed. The latter, subjective awareness is often charac- terized by shifts in interest and life direction. TESTS The author feels that, initially, Stage 7 provides the suggestion for an interesting test. Two groups, one of which is identi- fied as having marker memories, the other of which is identified as having none, can be subjected to identical association-inducing procedures. The marker memory group would be expected to have significantly more images relating to this modef than the non-marker memory group. The design of an experiment with this end in mind is planned shortly. A study proposal is now in prepa- ration by a well known psychologist to -survey percipient transformative effects. This is expected to reflect directly on Stage 8 concepts. The author would be pleased to hear from others suggesting other tests and experiments. The Gulf Breeze, Florida Photographic and CE III Case - Part III By Donald M. Ware, Florida State Director, Charles D. Flannigan, Lead Investigator and Walter H. Andrus, Jr., International Director Copyrighted by the Mutual UFO Network, Inc. (MUFON) March 1988 INTRODUCTION The date, November 11, 1987, introduced one of the most unique on-going cases in UFO history, in which investigators and researchers have had an opportunity to work alongside the principal and very coop- erative witness as the case unfolds. By journalistic policy, the MUFON UFO Journal does not publish a UFO sighting report until it has been thoroughly investigated, evaluated and assigned a definite classification: UFO, hoax, misperception, or deluded wit- ness. It is extremely rare to have an opportunity to study a continuing case of this nature and caliber. As we said in the March 1988 issue, we are breaking a precedent by inviting our readers to join the team of field investigators via the pages of the MUFON UFO Journal, in their search for evidence and answers to the incredible photographic case that may be classified as a CE I, CE II, CE III and possibly a CE IV case. Officially, the Mutual UFO Net- work will not, under any circumstan- 12 ces, issue a statement on the authen- ticity of this case until our investigation has been concluded and all of the facts and evidence are revealed, recorded and evaluated by pertinent members of the MUFON Board of Advisors — our consultants. In the meantime, everyone can benefit by learning the methods and techniques used to unravel this mystery as it unfolds before us. If this case is exposed as a grand hoax, Journal readers will be the first to know. At this stage of the investigation, it is either one of the most incredible cases in UFO history or a most fan- tastically orchestrated hoax, one* that would challenge the production skills of Steven Spielberg to duplicate. New readers to the Gulf Breeze, Florida scene should refer to the March, April, and May 1988 issues of the MUFON UFO Journal for pub- lished details up to this point. STEREO PHOTOS After the taking of ten (10) expo- sures of a multi-lighted object at Shoreline Park on February 26, 1988 with a special 3-D Nimslo camera, Dr. Bruce S. Maccabee explained to Mr. Ed a means of taking stereo pho- tos with dual Polaroid Sun 600 LMS cameras mounted on a boom and tripod stand. The cameras are spaced two feet apart on the boom with a wood sighting rod for calibration cal- culations. This arrangement is far superior to the 2-inch separation of the two outside lenses on the Nimslo camera (the Nimslo has four lenses). See photo numbers 5 and 6 for con- struction details. On March 17, 1988 at 10:05 p.m., the first set of stereo Polaroid photos was made at Shoreline Park. Dr. Maccabee calculated that the object was greater than 130 feet from the cameras. The exact distance is not known, since the calibrating stick and nail were not stable enough to be accurate. (See photos numbers 1 and 2.) There was another sighting report made to investigators at about this same time in the immedjate area. On March 20 at 10:50 p.m., two addi- tional photographs were made from MUFON UFO Journal, No. 242, June 1988"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Polaroid stereo photos 1 and 2 taken at Shoreline Park, March 17,1988 Ed's backyard. Preliminary analysis indicates that, (1) sighting lines diverge, therefore no distance calculations were possible, (2) object moved a lit- tle between pictures, (3) sighting line of left camera passes through a bush at approximately 20 feet and a tree at 60 feet, as shown by daylight photos. (Photos 3 and 4.) The most current photographs were taken May 1, 1988 and have been submitted to Dr. Maccabee for analysis. At the MUFON 1988 International UFO Symposium in Lincoln, Nebraska on Saturday evening, June 25th, Dr. Maccabee's speech will be titled \"A History of the Gulf Breeze, Florida Sighting Events\". He will share the techniques used to determine the photographs' authenticity, regardless of whether the case is highly credible or a hoax. Walt Andrus will present a slide/illustrated lecture of the \"Gulf Breeze Case\" prior to Bruce's pres- entation to set the stage for Dr. Mac- cabee's investigation and analysis. CEH In the continuing effort to docu- ment the cause for the circle of dead grass in the field behind the photo- grapher's home, Charles Flannigan contacted Max E. Griggs, Extension Agent in Agronomy at the University of West Florida. Mr. Griggs has given authorization to the media to reprint his letter and State Pathology Report MUFON UFO Journal, No. 242, JUNE 1988 \"only in its entirety\". (See Figures 1 and 2.) A photograph of the circle was published in the May 1988 Jour- nal. SKY ILLUMINATION In the May 1988 issue number 241 of the MUFON UFO Journal, (Page 15), Walt Andrus made the following comment: \"It is evident that the first five photos were not taken within a 3 to 4 minute time span as claimed by the witness, due to movement of the clouds and decreased sky illumina- tion.\" I asked Ed to replicate a series of sample photos with both his new Polaroid 600 LMS Sun camera and his old model Polaroid using 108 size film, after learning that the streetlight in front of his house had an auto- matic photo cell switch to turn it on. He started filming 4.5 minutes after the streetlight was switched on and made 5 photographs on May 8, 1988 starting at 7:41 p.m. and concluding at 7:48 p.m. (7 minutes elapsed time.) The sky illumination did indeed decrease a significant amount during the 7 minute period; far more than Walt would have believed under the circum- stances. Ed has invited the principal investi- gators to duplicate this test using a stop watch for accuracy. He used his Polaroid 600 LMS camera for this replication. PREVARICATORS? On page 13 of the May 1988 Jour- nal issue 241, Ed's twelve-year-old daughter observed the blue beam in their backyard and called to her father \"Daddy, Mommie needs you.\" Since this is definitely one time when their daughter personally observed one of the unusual events, Budd Hopkins, during his last visit to Gulf Breeze, privately interviewed the young lady. She described the terrifying experience in detail without hesita- tion. Mr. Hopkins' evaluation of her response was that Ed would have had to teach each of the members of his family and some neighbors to be \"bold bare-faced liars\" in order to pull off such a hoax. Investigators from MUFON, the Sentinel newspaper, and WEAR-TV have now interviewed approximately 67 witnesses to the Gulf Breeze sightings since November 11, 1987, whose sightings have not been identified. In Ufology we usually have only eyewitness reports, but in Gulf Breeze we have much more. Are we going to disregard the testim- ony of 67 other witnesses, as a few people have suggested when they labeled this case a \"probable hoax\". JURY STILL OUT On March 27, 1988, Robert D. Boyd mailed an article to many of the people directly involved in the inves- tigation of the Gulf Breeze Case titled, \"The Other Side of the Coin\", 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Polaroid stereo photos 3 and 4 taken from Mr. Ed's backyard on March 20, 1988 in which he elaborated upon some very superficial reasons for declaring that, in his opinion, the case was a hoax. (Your International Director was very disappointed in the unscientific scenario that Mr. Boyd proposed for his basic reasons, bordering upon slander of the witness.) He followed this article with a letter dated April 11, 1988 to Mark J. Rodeghier in which he tried to substantiate his previous unwarranted claims. To debate each of Mr. Boyd's alle- gations in the Journal would add very little since most are either innuendos, fabricated coincidences, rumors, or comments to create suspicion with- out any evidence to justify the allega- tions. However, one point in his arti- cle deserves a reply. Quoting from the 16-page paper, Boyd says: \"The wife of Mr. X has not signed any statements or supported her husband formally by signing documents even though she has reportedly witnessed and photographed the object and/or lights on at least one occasion. Not only does she not officially support her husband, she will not (or is not allowed to) be interviewed by visiting investigators save possibly Don Ware or Charles Flannigan on a previous occasion. Such information is very suspicious since a real experience shared by witnesses makes them eager to relate their experiences and support one another. A reason such as not wanting (his) wife and children 14 to be bothered or involved is a weak one indeed when one considers that they already must be if they have witnessed something truly unknown.\" Associate Editor's note: On my last visit to Pensacola, Bob Reid, Gary Watson and I spent over five (5) hours visiting and interviewing Ed's wife.) When Ed's wife read Robert Boyd's article \"The Other Side of the Coin\", she sat down and wrote a twenty- seven (27) page reply responding to each of the accusations made in the attack upon her husband. She pro- vided the names of the people, cir- cumstances, facts, and details repu- diating every claim of suspicion suggest- ed by Mr. Boyd. A copy of this letter to Donald Ware was mailed to Mr. Mark Rodeghier, Scientific Director, J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Stu- dies, and Walt Andrus on April 20, 1988. (Yes — the entire family is very much involved.)   ^ CUFOS BULLETIN After a hiatus of almost seven years, CUFOS is reinstituting its Bul- letin to once again provide important information and news. The specific spur for this decision lies in the series of ongoing events in Gulf Breeze, Florida. The story has gained some local publicity and has been discussed in other UFO publications (see the March and April 1988 issues of the MUFON UFO Journal.) As Mark Rodeghier was advised personally that this case was still under investigation by Dr. Bruce Maccabee, Budd Hopkins, Walt Andrus, and others, the premature announce- ment of a hoax is unwarranted. In a large boxed caption the Bulletin states, \"The Gulf Breeze photographs taken by Mr. X are most probably a hoax.\" The conclusion to the article on page 4 also notes that \"CUFOS expects this statement to be both the first and last one we make on Gulf Breeze. Ufologists have better things to do with their valuable time and resources than spend endless hours listening to tales of UFO visitations from Mr. X. Hoaxes do not occur often, despite what skeptics may claim, but when theyjdo, it is impor- tant that ufology quickly expose them for what they really are. The UFO Community did this with the Billy Meier case in Switzerland, as well as several others. We hope this state- ment from CUFOS contributes to a rational discussion of the Gulf Breeze events and a full expose of the facts and circumstances surrounding the reported sighting.\" (Associate Editor's note: This quote is published for the benefit of Journal readers who do not have access to the CUFOS Bulletin.)

Every article in the MUFON UFO Journal on the Gulf Breeze Case has been prefaced with a disclaimer as to final assessment. When this investiga- tion has been completed (the latest photographs were made May 1, 1988), Journal readers will be the first to know whether it was a fantastically orchestrated hoax or one of the most incredible cases in UFO history. As Mr. Ed has said, \"The truth will prevail.\" As of May 5, 1988, Dr. Bruce S. Maccabee has stated: \"There is no proof that Ed's sightings are a hoax. Furthermore, there is always the pos- sibility in the future that Ed may pro- duce some correlated photographic and video data that are irrefutable, since he is still trying to get hard evidence.\" Pictures and report continued on page 16.

Charles Plannigan 163 East Burgess Road Penacola, PL 32503 Dear Sir: Enclosed are nemotode assay results from soil samples I took at the Gulf Breeze site. As you see, nematodes of approximately the same number were found inside the circle of dead grass (sample No. 1) and outside. This information contained with the fact that the circle of dead grass was geometrically perfect/ negates the possibility of tte dead grass being due to a lightening strike. The fact that no scorching or eruption of plant tissue was present) further supports this idea. Observation of plant tissue inside the dead area and adjacent areas of healthy grass did not reveal any evidence of plant disease. No fungal/ bacterial or viral agent appeared to be responsible for the dead grass. Even if a plant pathogen had been actively causing disease in the grass/ it would certainly have been unheard of to kill in a geometri- cally perfect circle with descrete boundries of only 2-3 inches between dead grassand healthy grass. Considering also the fact that no other area of grass was dead within the immediate area/ I think that plant disease can be disqualified as the cause of the dead grass area. Observation of plant tissue inside and outside the dead grass area revealed no evidence of insect feeding to any portion of the plants. Here again such agents do not restrict themselves to such perfect symetry and to only a single isolated instance. Insect damage which could have caused the grass to die to the extent we found it/ would have been easy to identify by inspection in the field. As I told you on the telephone/ I used squash seeds as a test plant to see if a herbicide residual were present. Squash belong to a group of plants that tend to be very sensitive to herbicides. Three out of three seeds planted in soil taken from the dead grass site/ germinated and grew normally. This does not eliminate the possibility of a chemical agent being responsible for the dead grass, but it does lend support to this idea. The physical condition inside and outside the dead grass circle was essentially the same. Texture/ composition and usable rooting depth the same. A nutrient deficiency of such severity as to kill grass will not limit itself so discretely/ nor will it be so sudden and homogeneous in its impact. It is safe to disregard plant nutrient problems as the cause of this phenomenon. As you can see from the text of this letter, I have attempted to disqualify physical, chemicals' and biological causes that might normally kill bermuda grass. In short/ I have not been able to identify the cause of the grass dying/ but the evidence supports either the influence of short lived toxic chemical or exposure of the grass to an energy source capable of killing it. Either of these would have required mechanical precision to do what was observed on the field. Respectfully, MEG: CUB 4/27/88 Max E.

Joe Kirk Thomas' ingenious analy- sis of the Vehicle Interference Effect in Issue 233 leads him to the paradox of calculating a magnetic moment for the interfering source which if it is electro-magnetic in its form — explains the VIE data but is also, in his own words, \"awesome\" and \"absurd\" in its magnitude. (Something rather sim- ilar had, of course, been concluded by the Condon team in 1969, making a far more perfunctory examination of a single case). I hope Thomas will take comfort from the fact that a similar paradox dogs the efforts of other competent scientists who seek to come to terms with the mysterious phenomenon of ball lightning. Without in the least wishing to identify the two pheno- mena (UFOs and BL), I can't help wondering whether the \"energy para- dox\" in the two cases may have something to tell us. Here are some relevant references. (Others might be cited.) PRIOR STUDIES • 1970 — \"Is Ball Lightning A Nuclear Phenomenon?\" Article by Altschuler, M.D., House, L.L., and Hildner, E., in Nature Vol. 228. The authors feel a need to explain the h ighly energetic effects sometimes reported, eg. \"In one incident a lightn- ing ball fell into a rain barrel and boiled 18 liters of water ...\". And: \"There are reports of ball lightning exploding or shattering wooden logs, cutting metal cables and wires...\" They develop a theory of a nuclear reaction which might be set in train in thunderclouds, leading to a short- lived, cohesive ball with an energy of 10' Joules. Readers will recognize that ten million Joules is quite some MUFON UFO Journal, No. 242, June 1988 packet of energy. (It is, I suppose, mere coincidence that Altschuler was one of the contributors to the Con- don report.) • 1971 — \"Is Ball Lightning Caused By Antimatter Meteorites?\" Article by Ashby, D.E.T.F., and Whitehead, C., in Nature Vol. 230. These authors, too, are puzzled by the highly ener- getic effects of BL as often reported. They content themselves with a mere one million Joules, and try to find it in micrometeorites of antimatter. • 1974 — \"Radiation Dosage Asso- ciated With Ball Lightning.\" Article by Fleming, S.J., and Aitken, M.J., in Nature Vol. 252. Using the tech- niques of thermoluminescence, these authors measured the residual radia- tion effects from a well-documented BL event which occurred in 1970. They found nothing of significance. Commenting on the two studies men- tioned above, they cast serious doubt on the existence of energy levels in BL which come within several orders of magnitude of those assumed by their predecessors. An earlier study by Mills, A.A., published in Nature Vol. 233, suggests the same sort of conclusion (though Mills was studying a church steeple which had been damaged by BL in 1846, and the mere lapse of time possibly invali- dates his study). • 1976 — \"Ball Lightning In Smeth- wick.\" Article by Wooding, E.R., in Na- fure Vol. 262. (Smethwick is a suburb of the large English connurbation of Birmingham, UK.) Wooding was re- porting the outcome of his study of a BL event already reported in careful, first-hand detail by a fellow scientist, Mark Stenhoff (Nature Vol. 260). Both reports make fascinating read- ing, and both were made by highly qualified people. Wooding says, among other things: \"The lady is alive and well (despite some alarming damage to the dress she was wearing when the BL struck her in her kitchen, and notwithstanding some persisting phy-- siological effects which are reminis- cent of close UFO encounters) ... An upper limit of 250 Joules may be placed on the whole-body radiation.\" Two -hundred and fifty Joules is, of course, almost trivial. Wooding reach- es this conclusion despite the painful heating of the lady's wedding-ring dur- ing her BL encounter (a phenomenon which, again, reminds one of certain CE.IIIs). He ends: \"Nothing can be found to support theories based on radioactivity, antimatter or magnetic fields\"; and he stresses \"the low energies\" to which his study points. ENERGY PARADOX So there we have it. Very high energies have to be postulated to account for some of the effects of BL, and desperate hypotheses are sought to explain them. At the same time, only quite trivial energies seem to operate in particular cases. The parallel with Joe Kirk Thomas' diffi- culty is not quite exact: the first two studies mentioned above did not sug- gest to their authors anything too \"awesome\" or \"absurd\": they felt they could find the necessary ener- gies in conceivable natural processes, albeit using models which strain the imagination. The problem lies in a wild inconsistency between the ener- gies actually identified in particular cases; and here the parallel with \"Thomas' Dilemma\" (if one may call it that) seems quite close. I am far from being able to deter- mine how the dilemma might be resolved. But I will suggest that the parallels drawn above may point the way to further research. BL is — quite evidently — a \"transient energy form\" with paradoxical features. So perhaps are many other \"transients\" for which we have anecdotal evidence (William R. Corliss' Catalogs of Anoma- lies are full of them, and the Marfa Lights, discussed in Issue No. 235, may be a case in point. So perhaps is the classical polter- geist, for which the evidence is at least as strong (see that eminently sober and scholarly study by Alan Gauld & A.D. Cornell, Poltergeists, Routledge & Kegan Paul, London, (1976). So perhaps is the \"true\" Continued on page 19 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"CJFOs & Religion: The French Connection By Dr. Barry H. Downing With the publication of Jacques Vallee's Dimensions: A Casebook of Alien Contact (Chicago; Contempo- rary Books, 1988), the other shoe has been loudly dropped. UFOs may now be studied as both a scientific' and religious phenomenon. What we have witnessed in the UFO career of Jacques Vallee is a movement from a strictly scientific study of UFOs to a theory of UFOs in which religion is — reluctantly — found by Vallee to be right at the heart of the mystery. If we were to agree that Dr. J. Allen Hynek has made the most important scientific contribution to the study of UFOs thus far, Vallee would certainly get many votes for second place. In terms of pure research on a world- wide basis, he is probably unsur- passed. Thus to have someone of Vallee's stature arrive at this conclu- sion means the study of UFOs from this point on will include the religious issue as part of the analysis. Religion is no longer a bridesmaid in the UFO quest. At the same time, I should say that the better analogy here is that reli- gion has become the groom in the UFO situation, with science still the bride. (Forget the sexual problems in this transition.) The world is not ready for this. Val- lee is not ready for this. Science and religion were divorced ages ago. Science still has not forgiven religion for what it did to Copernicus and Galileo. Religion has not forgiven science for making a monkey's uncle out of all of us. Now UFOs — and Vallee — have put religion and science back in the same bed. Since they do not even speak the same language, the time ahead is going to be strained, to say the least. On the basis of my own experience, I know formal theology is not ready to begin a dialogue concerning the meaning of UFOs — I have called out, and no one has answered. 18 Vallee's first UFO book, Anatomy of a Phenomenon (1965), was a nuts- and-bolts approach to UFOs, and he saw the extraterrestrial hypothesis as the most likely explanation for UFOs at that time. But the historical study of UFOs led Vallee to explore the mythological character of UFOs in Passport to Magonia: From Folklore to Flying Saucers (1969). This book focused on the psychic aspect of fly- ing saucers at the expense of the physical nature of the phenomenon. In 1975 he began to integrate the physical and psychic UFO contradic- tions in The Invisible College, arguing that UFOs are \"a new form of religion.\" In Dimensions he carries this con- clusion further, arguing that 1) UFOs are real physical objects, but 2) they come from another dimension, a parallel universe, not from another planet, and that 3) UFOs have been the stimulus behind many religious miracles, not only in the Bible, but in regard to the 1917 Roman Catholic miracle at Fatima, Portugal, as well as the revelations to Joseph Smith con- cerning the Mormon religion in 1823. I had arrived at these same three basic conclusions in my The Bible and Flying Saucers twenty years ago. Vallee has come to these conclusions from a scientific starting point. Val- lee's book is excellent, and I recom- mend it to all. While he raises too many questions to be dealt with fairly here, I would like to make a few points. First, Vallee dismisses the extrater- restial hypothesis on the grounds that \"the extraterrestrial theory is not good enough, because it is not strange enough to explain the facts\" (p. 269). I do not think this is an ade- quate argument to dismiss the ETI theory of UFOs. After all, who knows how strange visitors from another planet may be? Vallee makes the argument that we have probably had an estimated three million UFO land- ings in two decades (p. 258), far too many to be merely some form of ETI here on a probe. We can buy all of Vallee's argument that UFOs are here to control us, not to visit us, and still argue that they come from another planet. The parallel universe theory is not necessary to explain this aspect of the problem (note I am arguing this in spite of the fact that I too have proposed the parallel uni- verse theory). I do believe it makes sense to keep the parallel universe theory open as an option to the extraterrestrial hypothesis. Vallee is also skeptical about what we are learning from the UFO abduc- tion phenomenon, this in spite of the fact that Whitley Strieber has written the Forward to Dimensions. Vallee is clearly skeptical of Budd Hopkins' report in Intruders concerning the impregnation of Kathie Davis by UFOs. He says, \"Many researchers speculate that such accounts prove that intruders from space are exper- imenting with human genetics, but they fail to point out that these mod- ern stories are consistent with per- plexing accounts that come to us from earlier times\" (p. 9). Vallee is inclined to think that UFO beings \"stage\" abductions of people like Kathie Davis, and involve her in a reproductive act, only to make a deep psychic impression on her. But I believe Vallee should simply carry his \"control\" theory further, and say that UFO beings control our destiny not only psychologically, but physically. For instance, Budd Hopkins inter- prets the Kathie Davis material to mean that UFO beings are in genetic trouble and need our own DNA (UFO beings show Kathie a girl whom she believes she bore through an inter- breeding process). My interpretation of the Kathie Davis story is that UFO beings are in charge — and have been in charge — in control Vallee would say — of the genetic development of life on earth. MUFON UFO Journal, No. 242, June 1968"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"The UFO message to Kathie and all of us is that UFO beings have helped develop the many human life form variations that we have on earth. They made us what we are today — genetically, psychologically, and spir- itually. In other words, they are God, or as god as we've got. I apologize for any inconvenience this causes those who prefer a pure theory of evolution. Vallee's use of biblical material is also weak. The index to his book indicates that he refers to Ezekiel several times, but there is no refer- ence to Moses, Jesus, or Paul, all of whom were involved in UFO close encounters, as I have argued else- where. The Exodus, and the \"pillar of cloud and fire\" that leads it, is the pivotal UFO event of the Old Testa- ment, not Ezekiel. If Vallee knew his biblical material better, it would strength- en his argument. His argument is that UFOs make deliberate contact to establish religions in human culture. \"/ suggesf that it is human belief that is being controlled and conditioned\" (p. 276). I agree, but to ignore UFO involvement with Moses, Jesus and Paul weakens Vallee's case. Vallee is not a biblical scholar, of course, and can be forgiven for his weakness, but the case he is making applies more strongly to the religion of the Old and New Testament than one would guess from reading Dimensions.- My final comment is not just to Vallee, but to all who study UFOs scientifically: faith is not a four letter word. Behind Vallee's rational scien- tific judgment is much fear, fear about what he has discovered, fear about what will happen if this idea gets out, fear that a new, dangerous religion will be started which will des- troy rational thought in a frenzy of religious blind faith and gullibility. This fear is somewhat justified. Who knows how many people have died in \"religious wars\"? And who knows that the UFO reality, this real- ity Vallee says controls us, is really good, really means us well? (If we can assume that some of our government leaders are as bright as Vallee, these may be their fears, too, that may have kept government UFO informa- tion hidden.) MUFON UFO Journal, No. 242, June 1988 But science has its dark side too — we do remember the Bomb? Faith and reason have always been in ten- sion in religion, and in life. Marriage is one of our most basic human acts, but it is almost never based on rea- son. It is based on faith — two peo- ple get married because they believe they can work out a good life together. This faith in turn leads to a sexual relation, which in turn means that faith plays a critical role in the whole human reproductive process. I have used reason to write this paper —but at this moment I have no knowledge that MUFON will publish it. I have only faith and hope. Faith is a fundamental aspect of human activity, and although it can be dangerous, it can also be creative. All of us involved in the UFO process are involved in both faith and science. We have faith that if we keep work- ing at this thing, we will come to understand it. Centuries ago a theol- ogian named Anselm called this \"faith seeking understanding.\" Vallee is nervous because UFOs are operating on our belief systems. He says \"It would certainly explain why there is no overt contact. Direct contact would preclude genuine learn- ing\" (p.276). And it would preclude faith, which is the realm of freedom that makes human creativity — in the image of God — possible. In my article \"Faith, Theory and UFOs,\" delivered at the MUFON UFO 1981 Symposium at MIT, I said, \"If faith is the name of God's game, and UFOs are part of God's faith game, then UFOs are likely to be there, making their presence felt, but always just out of reach\" (p. 42). If it is the aim of UFOS to create an environment for humans where faith is possible, then Vallee has rightly understood much of the logic — or metalogic as he calls it — of UFO behavior. Vallee is not sure whether the UFO control system is \"natural and spontaneous; whether it is explaina- ble in terms of genetics\" (p. 272). I would hope that someday Vallee will have the courage to wonder out loud: Could UFOs be a manifestation of the God of the Universe? At this point it would only be a hypothesis, of course. But if we are not dealing with God in the UFO phenomenon, it is a pretty good imitation. PARADOXICAL, continued UFO, especially when closely en- countered. Progress in understanding any one of these very different phen- omena may conceivably throw light on the others. And perhaps we can take comfort from the fact that hard- headed physicists are now seriously addressing the BL puzzle. Its solution may well illuminate a great deal else. NASA Levitation No doubt some of you will recall my article on Dale Pond and the long-neglected work of maverick invent- or John Keely, which appeared in the \"Anti-Matter\" section (the red pages) of the April issue of OMNI Magazine.

It appeared to be going very fast since it disappeared in about five to 10 seconds. It was without sound or odor but seemed to have a tail which extended about a yard or so. Five minutes later, witnesses saw a second object and after another five minute interval a third object was observed. They appeared in the south- west and flew to the northeast. The objects passed over the Oakland Street area or just to the side of it. They traveled at about 1000 feet and then disappeared behind the houses across the street from the witnesses. *** THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO -June 1953: At 11:10 pm on the 10th, an Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps cadet at Wayne University, Detroit, Michigan, observed a large bright object that was white or light yellow in color, round in shape and larger than a star. This object moved from a high westerly position in a fal- ling arc toward the north, and then leveled off, and proceeded at a high rate of speed to the north in a straight line. The object was visible for a period of 60 seconds and disap- peared over the northern horizon. There was no sound, trail, or exhaust. Several airmen in the control tower at Kelly Air Force Base, San Antonio, Texas, observed a UFO at 7:45 pm on the 16th for approximately five minutes. The object was elliptical in shape, and appeared to be the size of a 4% by 9%-inch envelope held at arm's length. No aerodynamic fea- tures, trail, exhaust, or propulsion system were noted. The object dis- appeared quickly, like a light being turned off. Witnesses said the object 20 was similar to a cloud or smoke through which a light was shining. Clarence O. Dargie was a sergeant in the operations center at Otis Air Force Base, Massachusetts, date un- known, when radar picked up a UFO and a jet was immediately \"scrambled\" to intercept the craft. As the plane climbed to 1500 feet to level off, all systems on the aircraft suddenly stopped working. \"That was nearly impossible because each system had a separate power source,\" Dargie said. \"If one source stopped working, the rest would continue to operate. But for some strange reason, all the systems were out.\" As the plane started to take a nose dive, the pilot ordered the navigator to eject. The normal procedure in such a situation was for the navigator to pull the first lever which ejected the canopy and a second lever for his seat ejection. Upon hearing the second explosion the pilot would then pull his own lever to eject him from the cockpit. However, Dargie said the pilot ejected after he heard the first explo- sion, which was the canopy, because crash impact was only a few seconds away. The pilot had to take the chance of colliding with his navigator. But when the pilot ejected and landed on the ground moments later, he could not find his plane or navigator, having landed in the backyard of a Cape Cod resident. Dargie said the resident reported not hearing any crash or seeing an airplane. The pilot apparently dropped into the man's backyard out of nowhere. \"After three months of intensive search the government never did find any trace of the plane or the navigator,\" Dargie said. \"If the plane had crashed there would have been an explosion. There was none, not a trace of it at all. Both the UFO and plane disappeared from the radar scope.\" (Clarence O. Dargie is a former MUFON Illinois State Section Director.) A private pilot flying over White- Plains, New York about 9:02 am on the 28th observed a circular, slightly elongated object, dark in color, and about six inches in diameter. The object was at an altitude of about 2500 feet and traveling northeast and doing about 240 MPH. *** TWENTY YEARS AGO - June 1968: Mr. and Mrs. Larry Ferney were driving near Roswell, New Mex- ico, about 2 am on the 20th when they saw a UFO descending from a height of about 100 yards. It was eas- ily visible because of its three lights, which looked \"like the landing lights of an aircraft.\" Making a 90-degree turn, the UFO headed down toward the car. To the badly frightened Fer- neys, it seemed the object was about to crash into them. Fifty feet away, it leveled out. Keeping this distance, the object paced the car for almost 10 minutes. Mrs. Ferney was in a state of near hysteria when the unknown object finally raced upward and out of sight. *** FIFTEEN YEARS AGO - June 1973: Many veteran policemen, a former radar operator and his wife say they watched UFOs put on an awesome \"aerial circus\" over Eastern Missouri on the 12th. \"I saw about five of them,\" said Deputy Pete Bishop of the Saint Charles County Sheriffs Department. \"They were a bright white color — small, like stars. I thought at first they must be planes. But I've never seen planes move like that. They'd go along in a straight line at incredible speeds, stop and shoot up at a 90-degree angle. It was weird, knowing you were watching some- thing from outer space.\" The UFOs were first spotted by Bob Baumbach, 31, a postal clerk and former ,Air Force radar operator. He and his wife, Patricia, 26, were walking near their house in Saint Charles at about 9:30 pm. \"I just happened to glance up and see this object streaking aross the sky,\" Baumbach said. \"I blinked a couple of times. I didn't believe it. It was a pretty clear night but there MUFON UFO Journal, No. 242, June 1988"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"were two massive clouds about 20 miles apart. This thing would dart between the clouds. Then another one shot out of the clouds and then another — about four in all.\" Baumbach said he called the police \"because we wanted someone in authority to back up what we'd seen.\" The first to come was Patrol- man Reuben Abbington, 31. \"When the police radio said this dude had seen a UFO, I had a quiet chuckle. And when I got there, I couldn't see anything at first. But suddenly I saw this object zip across the sky at lightning speed. I watched for about 50 minutes and saw three of them in all. Their maneuverability was unbe- lievable. I never saw anything'like it in my life.\" Detective Darrell Tullock also confirmed the sighting. \"Those were the weirdest things I've ever seen,\" Tullock said. \"Weird, weird, weird.\" He described them as veering off at high speeds, hovering and mak- ing incredible turns. As the group watched the objects, an airliner from St. Louis Interna- tional Airport passed overhead. \"One UFO was maybe 10-20 miles away, but it shot across the sky at lightning speed and caught up with the airliner in two seconds,\" said Baumbach. \"I doubt that the pilot saw it, as it took a sort of watching position directly above the plane and then suddenly darted off into a cloud.\" Abbington radioed the police dispatcher to call the airport and ask whether radar had detected the UFO. The airport tower said no. Barry and Delores Gettings also watched the objects. Mrs. Gettings described some of the movements as like a game of chicken. Two lights would zoom toward each other on a collision course, then one would shoot up at a steep angle and the other down. At other times one of the lights would hop over another one. Before the evening was over five more police cars, a motorcycle patrol- man and several off-duty policemen rolled up to watch the display of UFO activity. James E. Richard of Columbia, Missouri had a close encounter with a UFO on the 28th at 1 am. \"The way it moved, it was something unhuman, nothing man-made. I was scared to go outside.\" He said he load- MUFON UFO Journal, No. 242, June 1988 ed a rifle and a shotgun and then, \"I went from window to window to see what I could see.\" He said his daugh- ter, Vanae, 16, and his 3-year-old son, James, Jr., were with him at the time of the incident. Richard could not describe the shape of the object that approached to within about 50 yards of his home. \"We just saw a big, bright light out in our backyard,\" he said. His daughter said the light was white and orange. \"It lit up the whole area,\" Richard said. \"You couldn't see anything else. These big trees were swaying back and forth, back and forth. Personally, a glow came over me, just a cold feeling where I was just speechless, I couldn't even remember what I was saying at the time.\" Richard said when the UFO was near the house, \"Communications were cut off completely. All the elec- tricity went out.\" When the object moved away, he made several calls for help and to get witnesses during periods when his telephone was working. \"You could hear a rustling in the trees,\" Richard related. \"It was a thrashing noise like we've never heard before.\" At daylight, tracks were found pressed deeply into the ground of the meadow. Richard said they were not cow tracks or the tracks of any other animal he recognized. He pointed out places where grass was pushed over as though by passage of some creature, and said he had not previously noticed a limb which had been broken from a tree recently. Richard was an animal care techni- cian at the University of Missouri- Columbia. (This CE II case was investigated by Ted Phillips.) *** TEN YEARS AGO - June 1978: During the week of June llth, retired Air Force Col. William Coleman appeared on the Merv Griffin TV show, and revealed that he was pilot- ing a B-25 bomber in broad daylight in 1954 over southern Mississippi when he pursued a large UFO. The former chief of public information for Project Blue Book at the Pentagon from April 1961 to January 1962 said, \"We were cruising at 10,000 feet when we spotted a target somewhere around 20,000 to 25,000 feet. It was about seven miles in front of us to our right, and we were overtaking it. It then started descending across our flight path, and I decided to check it out. So I advanced power and began closing a little faster and descending. We kept getting closer and closer and pretty soon we were within a mile of the object, flying over trees at 345 MPH.\" Coleman said his crew closed to within an eighth of a mile of the object, which was disc-shaped. \"It was about 60 feet in diameter and 10 or 11 feet thick through the center,\" Coleman said, adding that the disc's edges tapered to a thickness of three to four inches. \"It had what looked almost like a titanium-type finish (silver gray). I pulled up and made a hard turn that put it out of sight for roughly four seconds. We whipped back to pull up alongside of it and it wasn't there. I zoomed up to 1500 feet. There it is!' I said. It was about two miles in front of us going across a field leaving a dusty trail behind it. I guessed its speed at 170 MPH.\" Coleman said he dove on the disc using a maneuver which again put it out of sight for a few seconds. When he pulled out, \"the object wasn't there. That's the last we ever saw of it.\" For years Coleman emphatically denied that he had had such an experience. Bryan Jude, 14, and John Wright, 13, were fishing at Williamson, West Virginia, on the 14th when a strange object appeared overhead at 10:35 pm. Bryan recalled \"the craft floated around in the air, about the height of the power lines.\" John said the object was gold and silver. Bryan said the craft had a door in the bottom and some kind of structure atop the circu- lar ship. He added that it appeared to be about 60 feet in diameter. They both agreed that two beams of light were focused on them and that red, green and blue lights were flashing at different points on the craft. They said they were not afraid at first and the light beams appeared not to affect them. All of a sudden things changed. \"We couldn't move,\" John said. \"We laid down and watched but Continued on page 23 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"In Others' Words By Lucius Parish The \"Anti-Matter/UFO Update\" col- umn in the February issue of OMNI is devoted to the many UFO sight- ings in New York's Hudson River Val- ley (and neighboring areas).

While it is short (12 minutes long) and in black-and-white, it contains brief inter- views with such notables of the time as Donald Keyhoe, Frank Scully and 22 Major General John Samford. A few UFO photos are included, as well as the Al Hixenbaugh UFO film which was taken in Kentucky. All in all, well worth having for the novelty of its news- reel-style presentation of the \"saucer scene\" in the early days. The distrib- utor has chosen to fill out the tape with \"trailers\" from many science- fiction films of the 1950s. It may be ordered from: Sinister Cinema, P.O. Box 777, Pacifica, CA 94044. The price is $16.95, plus $2.05 for postage and handling (CA residents add appro- priate sales tax). Letters To The Dear Editor, I would like to thank you for your comments in \"Editorial Update\" in the March 1988 issue of the Journal. This is, without a doubt, the most honest and refreshing bit of Journal- ism I have read in ages. As a writer of Technical Business Journals, I can appreciate the problems any writer faces when they approach any sub- ject. Too often I've found that even non-fiction books and articles of a technical or educational nature con- tain far more opinion than fact. But, what really bothers me is what they do not contain. Honesty. I appreciate the job you're doing with the Journal. I also appreciate the last few issues which, it seems to me, have come back down to the level of Earthlings like me with interesting Case stories devoid, for the most part, of the tiresome \"psychic\" angle. I also appreciated the articles regard- ing the Florida Case. I have written a separate letter on that matter having had some experience with Florida UFO matters. I re-read the articles many times and enjoyed the style of Finally, I would be interested in reading something by the Reverend Barry Downing. If MUFON has any- thing available by him, I would appre- ciate a listing and the prices. Thank you again for a sincere Update and a Job well done. William G. Knell Flushing, NY Dear Editor, I wanted to comment on the In Others' Words column by Lucius Par- ish (January 1988 issue). He reports my featurette (October 1987 Omni) concerning the \"mystery circles\" in southern England. He adds the comment that I advocate \"whirl- winds\" and this idea is \"totally absurd\" in view of the visual form of these occasionally complex patterns. I am not about to discuss the cir- cles themselves, as this is a compli- cated subject and Paul Fuller, BUFORA's Coordinator of Investiga- tioins for the relevant region, has already prepared a detailed article which MUFON will hopefully publish. However, I did want to warn against this sweeping over-simplifica- that I claim \"whirlwinds\" (a nice gen- tile word) are creating dozens of cir- cles, circle sets and infrequent quintuplet patterns. I have never sug- gested that this is the' answer in all cases; although I do believe the evi- dence supports it in at least some instances. I think it should be remembered that BUFORA has been extensively involved in the investigation of these circles since 1980, when Ian Mrzyglod had samples from them tested at Bristol University. A vast amount of work has gone into their study and analysis, mostly under the auspices of Paul Fuller during the past three or four years. The only scientist to express any interest and to have been deeply involved in active research with BUFORA, has been meteorologist, Dr. Terence Meaden. His reasons for proposing complex weather based phenomena as explanations have been outlined in many articles in the meteorological press and are based on factual investigations of an impres- MUFON UFO Journal, No. 242, June 1988"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"sive degree. I, for one, respect such \"hands on\" experience. However, everyone connected with this project (including Dr. Meaden, Paul Fuller and myself) are satisfied that whirlwinds DO NOT create every circle. Some are, beyond doubt, engineered by hoaxes. Indeed, some hoaxers have been uncovered. Paul and I put together BUFORA's 28-page study, \"Mystery of the Cir- cles,\" summarizing all the evidence and reviewing most of the theories. We have staged two open forum seminars in Lindon where all shades of opinion and belief were invited to give the evidence for their solution. And BUFORA has co-funded with the weather research center, TORRO, a significant project coordinated on our side, with considerable skill and common sense, by Paul Fuller. About the only thing this work has positively demonstrated is that there is NO SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER for the belief that these circles are UFO created. This may be a disappointing con- clusion for some ufologists to swal- low, but it has not been reached lightly. I think that UFO researchers distanced thousands of miles from this phenomenon, basing their ideas only upon pictures and sensational- ized reports, should recognize that BUFORA is a serious UFO research group with a quarter century expe- rience who has not sat back, collated stories about the circles and conjured .up increasingly obtuse theories about force fields and giant UFOs. Instead it has investigated, researched, set up hypotheses, tested them and formu- lated reasoned conclusions from the resulting evidence. This evidence might seem \"totally absurd,\" but this approach to resolv- ing cases is my view on how all UFO investigation should be conducted. I would have expected Lucius to appre- ciate that and have more respect for those who argue from a base of knowledge rather than one of pre-set opinion or ignorance.

BACK, continued still could not move. My head felt like it was going in and out (getting bigger and shrinking).\" Bryan added, \"it was like somebody was behind us and whispering; you couldn't understand what they were saying but you could hear.\" They don't remember heading for home some time later but became aware of their surroundings when they reached Bryan's house. \"I just remember going in the door of my home,\" Bryan said. Thinking back, John had a vague impression of sit- ting in a chair on a spaceship. Bryan seems to remember seeing a tall per- son or thing that looked like black- ened cheese.\"Yeah, there was a terrible smell,\" John added. The youths said they heard a rush of air just before the craft appeared on the scene. Bryan's mother said she had seen something traveling across the sky but heard no wind. Several residents in the neighborhood said they were awakened by a roaring sound. 23"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE \"Abductions and the E.T.
