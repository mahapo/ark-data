Part I addressed abduction sites; precognition of episodes and familiarity with certain beings; vehicle types; transporting the subject; features and odors inside; recognition of other subjects; and descriptions of entity features, their garments and locomotion. This segment describes subject restraints; alteration of consciousness, mind probes and other observations; the \"leader of the pack\"; entity voice qualities, communi- cations and human-like behaviors; devices and instru- ments used, samples taken and resulting pain: sexual and reproductive factors; and physical after-effects. SUBJECT RESTRAINTS Of the 95 cases in this study, 61% of the subjects were convinced they were restrained in some manner, espe- cially while lying on a table in the vehicle. Reasonably inferred, most of the remainder felt the same effect, though not expressing it afterward. Four individuals said they were physically strapped onto a table. In 51 cases an unseen force \"paralyzed\" the subject, while in 22 there was a \"numbing\" (or \"heavy\") effect, either overall or on the extremities. Certainly, there is an overlap among reports of paraly- sis and numbing, though the force applied might vary. ALTERED CONSCIOUSNESS At some point in most abductions scenarios, the subject sensed a change in his/her conscious state. Sixteen subjects related an out-of-body mindset — not connected to any such artificial state that some hyp- notists use to enhance a person's memories. Phrasings such as \"aerial view,\" \"away from my body,\" and \"popped out\" bring the point home. Sleep was induced suddenly in 23 cases. Sometimes it was onboard the craft and apparently just prior to a medical procedure. Often it was the subject's last recol- lection of the event before departure or after being re- turned to bed. The most repeated manipulation of human con- sciousness, however, has been a drugged-like state. Subjects recall having been \"dazed,\" \"confused,\" \"catatonic,\" \"stunned\" or \"in shock\" through much or all of an episode. This condition was articulated in 49 cases and probably occurred in far more. WATCHING & STARING Intent observation of the subject aboard the craft is a very common factor in abductions. David Jacobs char- acterized the element of \"staring\" at the subject from very close range as a \"mindscan\" procedure. (1) From a fair reading of the 317 transcripts, it is often difficult to ascertain whether the observation related was \"staring\" or rather a sentry's watchful gaze from a reasonable distance. Nevertheless, the attempt is made to divide this factor into \"watching\" and the more intrusive \"staring.\" Half (47) of all subjects in the study indicated that one or more beings were \"watching\" him/her intently at some point. This might also have occurred in many more cases wherein the subject was unaware of same. In 39 cases, the subject felt a close-up \"staring\" by a particular entity, who was always \"the one in charge.\" In some of these — but only a relative few — the subject conveyed that the purpose was to probe the mind. Regardless of intent, it can be said with assurance that most subjects did not especially enjoy the experience. Conversely, in seven cases the subject was left alone in a room longer than momentarily. None attempted to escape. THE LEADER In nearly a third (29) of the study's cases, a particular en- tity was identified as having a supervising role. On oc- casion, this status was accorded the one in charge of what might be called an \"away team\" conducting the ac- tual abduction. More often, it was either a \"doctor\" on- board the ship who conducted extensive or intricate medical procedures or an \"old one\" who oversaw the proceedings. Whatever prompted the subject's conclusion, this being was clearly a \"boss,\" And that denotes the basic notion of rank among some — or all — groups of alien visitors. Parenthetically, such entities in charge, likened to many human doctors and executives, were often found to be impatient, humorless or both. MARCH 1994 NUMBER 31 I PAGE 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL VERBAL COMMUNICATION Two-thirds of these initial 95 cases in- cluded mention of verbalized, entity- to-human communication. Virtually without exception, telepathy was the medium. Some subjects have related mes- sages which, they are convinced, were conveyed in perfect English. Others have struggled to explain receiving the (perhaps pre-lingual) essence of an entity's thoughts, which the subject filled in with nouns, verbs, adjectives and the like. In a few prominent cases, the subject recalls having had a long and wide- ranging discourse with a particular be- ing. Apart from those, the content of communications by abductors was quite structured and of three basic types: pro- cedural, nonprocedural but related to the event, and post-event related. Procedural (or instructional) communications were always brief and directly related to the subject's com- pliance concerning a medical or other technical matter at hand. Commands such as \"calm down,\" \"don't Table 6 Nonverbal Communication Showings (45%) Images (39%) Symbols (10%) Gestures (6%) 0 5 10 15 20 25 Number of Subjects Reporting the communication (from 37 cases out of 95) move\" and \"feed the baby\" were typical and associat- ed with 26 cases. Nonprocedural mentions still concerned the event sequence but were not directly connected to a specific procedure. Reassurance of the subject (e.g., \"it's all right\" or \"we won't hurt you\") was by far the most rep- etitious, offered in 35 cases. \"Come with us,\" \"stay Table 7 Entity Human-like Behavior Caring (23%) Friendliness (21%) Anger/Arguing (11%) None (detachment) (9%) Humor-Laughter (7%) Fear (6%) Surprise (5%) Pleased (5%) Confusion (3%) Threat (2%) Sadness (2%) Frustration (2%) Curiosity (2%) Violence (1%) Patience (1%) Need for Acceptance (1%) Gratitude (1%) 10  15 Number of Subjects Reporting the behavior (from 51 cases out of 95) PAGE 4 NUMBER 311 MARCH 1994"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Nosebleed(s) (37%) Scar (all areas) (34%) Headache (17%) Healing (11%) here,\" \"time to go back\" and \"sleep now,\" were likewise common. In total, such comments were uttered in 46 cases. Post-event-related communications were found in 28 cases: \"Forget\" or \"can't tell\" (anyone); the opposite, \"re- member\" (the encounter); as well as vague instructions to perform some fu- ture \"mission\". VOICE QUALITY A fifth of all subjects in the study re- marked on the audible voice of one or more beings, always entity-to-entity communication. Reported in six cases each were whispering and chattering (the latter denoting a language seem- ingly without vowels). Five other sub- jects said they heard low-pitched sounds made up of either grunts or mumbles. Importantly, though suppositions were made on oc- casion, no subject claimed to understand any remarks made in the entities' own language. NONVERBAL COMMUNICATION Nearly two out of five cases (37 in total) indicated re- ceipt of instructions or other information in a nonlingual form. These can be divided into four categories: ges- tures, images, showings, and symbols. Gesturing was evident in just four cases. In each, a being held its hands up or motioned to the subject in a self-evident fashion. Images — variously on a screen, in holographic form, or projected into the subject's mind — were far more regular in the sequence of events, appearing in 28 cases. In nine of these, an animal (e.g., owl or deer) was rep- resented, especially to subjects in their childhood, ap- parently to disguise an entity's appearance at the outset of the abduction sequence. While onboard, twelve subjects saw images of the Earth in its past or future, from dinosaurs to earth- quakes, devastated rainforests and nuclear wars. In ten cases the subject was given images of an ex- traterrestrial world — rocky desert terrains, an oddly col- ored sky, whole planets or solar systems. The category \"showings,\" occurring in a third of all cases, denotes one or more tangible things intentionally shown to the subject or, in a few instances, a tour of the ship. The most dramatic of these involved \"hybrid\" in- fants — or incubators containing fetuses in gestation — as viewed by 17 subjects. In 12 cases, the subject wit- nessed hybrid (post-infant) children or adults. HUMAN-LIKE BEHAVIOR Alien visitors are usually said to be stone-faced. But, contrary to the widely held idea that they are without Table 8 Post-Event Effects 2 4 6 8 10 Number of Subjects Reporting the effect (from 29 cases out of 95) 12 14 feelings, displays of human-like emotions (positive and/or negative) have been conveyed in over half (54%) of the study's cases. On the negative side, an entity's anger or arguing — with the subject or other entities — was displayed in 12 cases. Fear of the subject was deduced in seven; frus- tration, sadness, or threatening demeanor in two cases each; and violent behavior in one. Positive emotions were expressed in large numbers: caring, compassion or love in 25 cases; friendliness in 23; humor (including laughter or joking) in eight; and pleasure in reaction to the subject's behavior in six. Ten subjects made particular mention that a \"leader\" maintained a stark detachment, showing no emotion whatsoever. Table 7 details these and other behaviors. DEVICES & INSTRUMENTS For purposes of this study, a \"device\" is a machine, seemingly intended for a particular medical procedure (e.g., scanning the subject's prone body). It is generally seen attached to a wall, on a mobile cart or lowered from the ceiling. \"Instrument,\" by contrast, denotes a small, hand-held implement such as a syringe with at- tached needle. One or more devices were noticed by 46 subjects, while 44 described an instrument. Taken together, de- vices and/or instruments were present in 61% of all cases. It can safely be said that, apart from poking the sub- ject's vertebrae or twisting his/her joints as part of a \"check-up,\" nearly all medical procedures involve a machine, instrument or both. Based on only the tran- scripts, however, attempts to describe such tools or their specific purposes would be highly speculative. MARCH 1994 NUMBER 31 I PAGES"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL SAMPLES Twelve subjects recalled that beings collected tissue or other samples. Ankles, arms, feet and the inside of the mouth were scraped; nails and locks of hair were clipped; and incisions or \"scoop\"-type gouges were em- ployed to remove flesh. While many more subjects may have been unaware of such collections due to altered states of consciousness, it is odd that only this small number had specific memories thereof. PAIN Agonizing pain is widely thought to be a standard fea- ture of CE-4 cases. Yet, in 58% of the study's cases, none was ever reported. Among the 40 cases wherein pain was a factor, no one area of the human anatomy was a standard target. The more frequent were: cranium - 13 nose/sinus - 5 ear- 5 back/kidney - 7 vagina/uterus - 12 leg/knee - 11 Localized pain may indicate an implant or excision. Moreover, numerous transcripts imply that small ob- jects have been implanted or tissue removed without any discomfort to the subject. Readers are cautioned not to draw unwarranted conclusions. SEXUAL/REPRODUCTIVE ELEMENT Nearly half of all subjects recalled, as part of their over- all experiences, one or more events related to human re- productive systems and sexuality. These included har- vesting sperm from males and ova from females, fetus abortion, and moments of sexual orgasm. Seven adult and teenage males in the study remem- bered an apparatus placed over the genitals, followed by an immediate erection and discharge. For most, the episode was not recalled as pleasurable. It bears men- tion that, in 30 other cases involving a male subject, no such procedure was mentioned. By contrast, among the 68 females in the study, 43 recalled a gynecological or obstetric procedure. Given the subjects' usually altered state at the time, it would not be appropriate to speculate in this report on the purposes for such intrusions. Orgasm or lesser sexual pleasure, by either men or women, was a reported element in 13 cases. POST-EVENT EFFECTS Almost one-third of the subjects reported some type of physical effect as a direct result of one abduction episode or another. Nose bleeds resulted in 13 cases and scars in 12, half of those on a leg or knee. [Note: General reporting of nose bleeds and scars apart from known encounters have been excluded from these totals.] Curiously, in four cases the subject was either told by an entity or separately concluded that the beings' \"re- constructive surgery\" had repaired some serious medical problem. SUMMARY In this two-part report, an initial attempt has been made to bring the average MUFON UFO Journal reader \"up to speed.\" To the author, one conclusion and some funda- mental questions are immediately evident. Conclusion: Numerous entity types have been visiting our planet with some regularity. What is not very evident from the data herein, but somewhat clearer from the transcripts per se, is that entities are grouped into two or more types working together in the same craft, usually with a strict ranking of duties. QUESTIONS: 1. Do grey-, white-, tan-, dark-, blue- and green- toned entities, not to mention extremely tall Nordics, have similar agendas? 2. Are differences in evolutionary development suggested by the number and types of digits on enti- ties' hands? By their ability or inability to self-levi- tate? Between those who use \"mindscan\"(2) and oth- ers who do not (or cannot)? How does one justify two starkly contrasting impressions that are firmly held by many subjects after multiple CE-4 episodes? • A considerable number fervently believes the visitors exude love and compassion for them as sub- jects and all of humanity. • A smaller but enraged group is equally con- vinced that the intruders are fundamentally evil. The new computer purchased jointly by MUFON and the Fund for UFO Research is the most powerful beast on the block. In the days (and particularly the late nights!) ahead, it will be working overtime, assist- ing the participating researchers to sort through all the data in ways that were never before attempted. As the first 317 transcripts begin to stretch toward a thousand, and the current 95 separate cases approach 300, we will be in a better position to answer these nettlesome questions. Let us all cross our fingers that we have enough time left. Special thanks go to Mark Williams, systems coor- dinator for the project, who integrated the computer system, customized its software, and created the insightful graphics in this report. And heartfelt praise is due the dozens of dedicated transcriptionists, with- out whom this information could never have been developed.

FIRST SCIENTIFIC UFO SYMPOSIUM HELD IN PORTUGAL By Joaquim Fernandes On October 23, 1993, CNIFO (Comissao Nacional de Investigacao do Fenomeno) conducted the first academic UFO symposium in a Portuguese university, the Porto's Faculty of Arts, with all speakers representing important scientific departments of major universities. Also present were people from the Meteorological Institute, the National Defense Institute and the Portuguese Air Force. Former general-in-chief of the Portuguese Air Force, Conceicao e.Silva, contributed to the workshop discus- sions. Good press coverage acknowledged the historical significance of the CNIFO symposium and emphasized the scientific approach to the study of UFOs. Two of the goals to be accomplished for future co- operation with government agencies were: (1) Receiving collected data on anomalous and luminous phenomena from the Meteorological Institute, and (2) the principal target is the Air Force information division and the files in the Portuguese Joint Staff of the Armed Forces Intelligence Division in Lisbon. An assembled group of distinguished scientists from the Porto, Lisbon and Vila Real Universities signed a document establishing a pro- tocol stressing the importance of the data mentioned in the aeronautic and military reports, similar to the break- through that Vincente-Juan Ballester Olmos achieved in Spain. The symposium theme was \"Unidentified Phenomena — Myth, History and Science,\" hosted by CNIFO with Joaquim Fernandes as moderator. (Mr. Fernandes is MUFON's Representative for Portugal.) Other speakers were Jose Fernando Monteiro, a geologist researcher at the Tras-os-Montes and Alto Doura University; Armindo de Sousa, medieval historian from the Porto Faculty of Arts; Jose Ferreira da Silva from the Porto Faculty of Sciences; and Luis Bernardo, an optical and laser re- searcher from the same university. Of particular interest, Jose Ferreira da Silva, in his presentation, made a close examination of Dr. Richard F. Haines' data collection on aerial close encounters made by military pilots in the MUFON 1992 International UFO Symposium Proceedings. He referred to the EM ef- fects detected and asked for continued observation and collection of this kind of data with high credibility and strangeness in order to challenge this phenomenon with current physics. Mr. Fernandes and CNIFO are to be congratulated and commended for this historical and scientific break- through for the UFO phenomenon in major Portuguese universities and government agencies.

MARCH 1994     NUMBER 31 1 PAGE 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL THE UFO CRASH AT ROSWELL New research & new witnesses result in new Roswell book. Will it finally lay the controversy to rest? By Kevin Randle and Donald Schmitt B y the time you read this our new book, The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell, should be in bookstores. Because of the vast amount of infor- mation involved, and the number of investigators who have looked into the case, there is a large area for po- tential controversy here. We hope any controversy will be in the nature of legitimate disagreement and not po- litically motivated. What follows is a brief, chapter by chapter summary of the book's contents. The Introduction addresses the expected attack on the book to come from those who are only interested in the conventional wisdom about the Roswell Incident. Chapter 2, \"On the Impact Site,\" is a comprehen- sive look at what the first people to encounter an alien space ship found when they arrived at the crash site. It is based on the account of numerous witnesses, many of whom are interviewed here for the first time. The actual crash was witnessed by a man and his woman friend (named in the book), who not only saw the crash, but the craft and bodies afterwards. In addition, a flaming craft was seen by Catholic nuns, William Woody, Corporal E.L. Pyles, and a group of archaeologists in the Roswell area (who are also named in the book), effectively eliminating the balloon hypothesis. The documented evidence, including a diary page, shows that the crash took place late on the evening of July 4, as corroborated by the eyewitnesses. The military retrieval began on the morning of July 5. Major Edwin Easley was responsible for setting the cordon around the impact site. He, as well as other mil- itary officials, was also interviewed, providing fresh insights into the crash. Chapter 3, \"Glenn Dennis and Ruben Anaya\": The Roswell mortician, Glenn Dennis, received a number of strange phone calls from the base asking about the preservation of bodies. Later, he spoke to a nurse he knew who told him about the small alien creatures that she'd helped autopsy. Dennis has both first and second hand testimony. He saw wreckage at the base, saw guards on the ambulances containing debris, and was threatened, more than once, by various military per- sonnel. Ruben Anaya brought the then New Mexico lieu- tenant governor, Joseph Montoya from the base to his house. Montoya spoke of the horrible thing that he'd seen out at the base. These were the bodies of small alien creatures. Anaya's story has been corroborated by fam- ily members, including his daughter and his brother. Friends of the Anaya's have also corroborated this tale about Montoya, the small creatures that Montoya saw, and veiled threats by the FBI. PART II: DEBRIS Chapter 4, \"Mac Brazel and the Debris Field\": On the morning of July 5, 1947, Brazel found that one of his pastures was littered with metallic debris. It was strange stuff that he couldn't identify. He took a sample of it into Roswell and was later interviewed by the military. Held at the base for a number of days, Brazel would never tell anyone what he learned. Chapter 5, \"Sheriff George Wilcox\": Alerted to some- thing strange, Wilcox responded. Although he handled some of the debris, and according to his granddaughters, had seen the alien bodies, Wilcox wanted nothing to do with the story after the military spoke to him, espe- cially when, according to granddaughter Barbara Dugger, military officers had threatened to kill all of them. Her grandmother witnessed these threats made by the military. Chapter 6, \"Major Jesse Marcel and the Debris Field\": As the air intelligence officer of the 509th Bomb Group stationed at Roswell Army Air Field, Marcel was the man sent to inspect the debris field. Although all he ever saw was metallic debris, he was convinced that he'd handled pieces of a craft from another planet. Without Marcel's testimony, there would have been no Roswell case. T he Marcel section is based on the interviews con- ducted by Robert Pratt in 1979. It provides addi- tional details about what happened on July 6 and 7 when Marcel and Counter Intelligence agent Sheridan Cavitt were shown the debris field by Brazel. Chapter 7, \"The Press Accounts\": Alerted to some- thing strange by the information officer of the 509th, the newspapers and radios around the country tried to learn more. A press conference held in General Roger Ramey's office in Fort Worth, Texas, answered their questions for the moment. Later, those answers began to weaken. Chapter 8, \"The Story of the Century, July 8, 1947\": On July 8, 1947 the United States Army announced that they had captured a flying saucer. For just over three hours, the world waited until Brigadier General Roger Ramey told waiting reporters that a mistake had been made. Through the use of wire service stories and interviews with a number of reporters who are still alive, a minute by minute account of those few hours has been reconstructed. PAGES NUMBER 31 I MARCH 1994"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Chapter 9, \"KGFL, Walt Whitmore and Frank Joyce\": While the world waited for more information, Army officers in Roswell were trying desperately to shut off the flow of data. Using intimidation and lies, they were able to stop the reports that something unusual had hap- pened. One of the areas attacked was radio station KGFL. Frank Joyce, the reporter, was able to shed light on this. Teletype messages are used to reconstruct the re- ports. Joyce, the only person who interviewed Mac Brazel both before he spoke to the Army and after, pro- vided a unique insight into what happened during those first few days. PART III: AFTERMATH Chapter 10, \"The Wright Field Connection\": If there was a crash of an alien spacecraft at Roswell, then a com- mittee to reverse-engineer it would have been created. Although the name of that committee isn't known, their existence is. Through eyewitness testimony, a portrait of that committee is presented. Brigadier General Arthur Exon, who it is now claimed was only speculating, provided interesting in- sight to the activities of the military at Wright Field. Exon. however, when first speaking to us, was not spec- ulating, but telling us what he had observed himself while assigned at Wright Field, later at the Pentagon, and then as the base commander at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Chapter 11, \"The Autopsy Report\": The bodies re- covered were, quite naturally, studied by a variety of ex- perts. Access to the doctors who conducted the autopsies has been limited. Len Stringfield has provided some interesting data and shared it. And one doctor (named in the book) provided information about her research on the spinal cord. Chapter 12, \"The Threats\": The Army and the gov- ernment wanted nothing said about the crash near Roswell. They moved quickly to suppress the informa- tion. While the military men and women could be sworn to secrecy, the civilians were another matter. A number of them, including Glenn Dennis, Frankie Rowe, Ruben Anaya, and the family of George Wilcox explained how they had been threatened by officials of the govern- ment. Had this been the crash of an experimental bal- loon, they might have requested those involved to re- main silent. But the threats went beyond that. Glenn Dennis \"would be picking his bones out of the sand.\" Frankie Rowe was going to \"be taken out into the desert.\" There was nothing subtle about the attempts to silence the civilians, including several children. Chapter 13, \"Anatomy of an Investigation\": The Associated Press sent two representatives, Jason Kellahin and Robin Adair, into the Roswell area. Their stories have never been reviewed. Now, with their first hand reports, and the documentation available, it is pos- sible to learn exactly how human memory works, how two people can tell what they believe to be the truth, and how all of that fits into a complex whole. I t is also interesting that Kellahin tells of seeing the bal- loon on the Brazel ranch, and of photographs taken there, with military officers standing around it. This could be the information needed to crack Roswell case. Chapter 14, \"Twining, Project Moon Dust, and Government Deceit\": On September 23, 1947, Lieutenant General Nathan F. Twining, the commander of the Air Materiel Command, announced that \"The phenomenon reported is something real and not vision- ary or fictitious.\" Twining was telling his subordinates that flying saucers existed. Unfortunately, in the text of that same letter, he claimed that there had been no proof \"in the shape of crash recovered exhibits.\" An ex- amination of that letter, of the attitudes of the time, and the circumstances of the creation of the letter provide us with a better understanding of both those statements. The latter is coupled to a handwritten note by J. Edgar Hoover which said, \"...we must insist upon full access to discs recovered.\" That suggests that something real was going on, and a study of that tells us exactly what was happening. After Twining's suggestion for a priority investigation was made, the government responded with Project Moon Dust. Documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act reveal that Moon Dust was a real project that was charged with the retrieval of space de- bris. Documentation now available proves that there was also a highly classified project that had nothing to do with Project Blue Book and was not based at Wright- Patterson Air Force Base. Chapter 15, \"Search for the Archaeologists\": Barney Barnett suggested that archaeologists had been on the impact site with him. For the first time those people have been located and their stories are incorporated into the Roswell case. First hand testimony from one of the ar- chaeologists brings this aspect of the Roswell case into sharper focus. No longer is it necessary to speculate about them because they have been identified. The other aspect is that these people were not on the Plains of San Agustin, but were near Roswell, no more than thirty-five or forty miles from the military base. PART IV: THE EXPLANATIONS Chapter 16, \"Alternative Explanation 1 — Japanese Balloon Bombs\": One researcher has claimed that Roswell can be explained by a Japanese fugo, or balloon bomb. There is very good evidence to refute that claim, including the testimony of more than a dozen people in Roswell who were in a position to know. Chapter 17, \"Alternative Explanation 2 — A V-2 Rocket\": There are also those who have claimed that Roswell can be explained by the wreckage of a V-2. Overlooking the fact that many of the men at Roswell MARCH 1994 NUMBER 31 1 PAGE 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL had served in Europe and a few even had wreckage from a V-2, there is a better case to be made. Evidence collected from the White Sands Missile Range as well as various archives shows that a V-2, or any other rocket, will not account for the wreckage found. Chapter 18, \"Balloons, Bombs, and Experimental Aircraft\": All the other explanations for the wreckage are explored, showing that there is not a shred of evi- dence that can explain the Roswell case in mundane terms. A careful examination of the facts reveals little room for any other explanation. Chapter 19, \"A Complete Examination of the Facts\": Looking at the case from the point of view of a lawyer building a closer argument, shows no room for any ex- planation other than extraterrestrial. By looking at a small portion of the case, an alternative can be found. But, when all the facts are brought into play, the alter- natives fall away. The names of many of the witnesses who handled the debris, who were on the impact site, and who helped remove the bodies from the crash site are used for the first time. PART V: BARNEY BARNETT AND THE PLAINS OF SAN AGUSTIN Chapter 20, \"The Plains of San Agustin\": For years the story of a second crash has been circulating. Serious re- search shows that the tale can be traced to a single source who is long dead. Objective research shows that nothing happened on the Plains and the stories coming from there have done little other than cloud the issue. This will put to rest many of those rumors. PART VI: THE TIME LINE Chapter 21 is a chronological listing of the events lead- ing up to and following the Roswell Incident. We have also included a number of Appendices on the MJ-12 hoax, the Witnesses (a comprehensive listing broken down into first and second hand sources) and other rel- evant documents.

MUFON Abroad The Mutual UFO Network-Central European Section (MUFON-CES) is made up of German speaking members from the nations of Germany, Austria and Switzerland. It currently has 85 members, including 30 natural scientists, 20 engineers, 10 med- ical doctors, six journalists, and several psycholo- gists and psychiatrists, among others. The Coordinator for MUFON-CES, and MUFON National Director for Germany, is Illobrand von Ludwiger, a speaker at the 1993 MUFON Symposium in Richmond, VA. He has held these po- sitions since 1974. MUFON-CES is an elite group of professionals in which membership is by invitation only, comparable to VISIT in Houston, Texas, which is composed mainly of personnel who work at the nearby Johnson Space Center. The group's collective credibility among their European scientific and media colleagues is well de- served. Having achieved this pinnacle, however, they became targets for skeptical UFO groups in Germany such as GEP, CENAP and GWUP, which are similar to our own CSICOP. They are also very sensitive to outsiders claiming affiliation. As an example, an ar- ticle in UFO Universe, Spring 1994, stated that Michael Hesemann was the MUFON Representative for Germany. This is definitely not true. He is a Journal subscriber only and does not have a MUFON ID card. There are a few other Journal subscribers in Germany who would like to speak for MUFON in public, but who are not authorized to do so. There is only one MUFON organization in Germany. Literature recently released by a Mr. Koch and Mr. Kyborg advertizing a \"MUFON-Berlin\" was misleading, even though they are members of MU- FON-CES. A new UFO institution was formed in Germany with the acronym DEGUFO, which in- cludes a subgroup, RUFON, in Hamburg. MUFON- CES is working cooperatively with these groups. MUFON-CES conducted their annual meeting in Feldkirch, Austria, on October 30, 1993, followed by their first regional meeting on February 5, 1994, in Ottobrunn, near Munich, where 53 people were in at- tendance. Incidentally, Rolf-Dieter Klein conducted a com- puter analysis of the Armary UFO photographs from Puerto Rico, which show a disk with a jet fighter nearby (promoted by Jorge Martin) to be a fake. Mr. Martin has been so informed. On February 26th, ten distinguished MUFON- CES members subscribed to the MUFON UFO Journal for 1994. This short article is an update on the activities of MUFON-CES as faxed from Mr. von Ludwiger. It does not address any UFO photo- graph or abduction cases presently in progress, nor any recent TV programs and appearances. —Walt Andrus PAGE 10 NUMBER 311 MARCH 1994"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL The Background of the GAO Investigation An exclusive inside look at how the ongoing GAO investigaton into Roswell came into being. By Fred Whiting ALBUQUERQUE (AP) — U.S. Rep. Steve Schiff savs the investigative arm of Congress is looking into a well- known UFO case to determine whether a government cover-up followed the 1947 crash of a mysterious object in New Mexico. — The Associated Press; January 13, 1994 I t was a typical day at work in July 1992.1 was at my office, a trade association in the health care field, where 1 am Director of Public Relations. The phone rang, as it does frequently, and I picked up the receiver. The voice was familiar: \"Hi, Fred. This is Karl Pflock. You may recall we worked together on Capitol Hill.\" My mind flashed back to the early 1980s, when I was working as a press secretary to Rep. Ray McGrath, a freshman congressman from New York. Karl at that time was a legislative assistant to Rep. Ken Kramer of Colorado, specializing in defense issues. Karl and I had collaborated on the formation of the Congressional Staff Space Group, which evolved into the Congressional Space Caucus, a coalition of congressmen who were supportive of the United States space program. Karl brought me up to date on his activities since I left Capitol Hill in 1983 to become Executive Director of the American Space Foundation, a citizens-support- ed pro-space lobby. Karl left the Hill in 1985 to become Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Testing and Evaluation. In 1989, he went to the BDM Corporation, where he was a strategic planner for clients such as the Ford Motor Company, Lockheed, and the U.S. Department of Energy. Then, in 1992, he decided to abandon the Washington politi- cal/government scene to return to full-time writing and research. One of his proposed projects: unidenti- fied flying objects — specifically, the Roswell case. He said he was calling because he heard I was involved in an effort to initiate a congressional inquiry into the case. The \"congressional initiative\" was born in July 1990, when the Fund for UFO Research brought together ten of the witnesses for a meeting in the Washington area with the primary investigators: Stanton Friedman, Kevin Randle, and Don Schmitt. The purpose of the meeting was to de-brief the witnesses, record their testimony on videotape, and eventually present the evidence to Congress. At a post-conference meeting with the in- vestigators, all agreed that the goal would be to initiate congressional hearings which could generate more wit- nesses and more evidence, hopefully resolving the mat- ter once and for all. The first task was to compile all of the relevant testi- mony into a briefing paper for a congressional audi- ence and to edit the videotaped interviews into a pre- sentable format. Then, my colleagues in Washington (primarily Don Berliner, Howard Hoffman, and Rob Swiatek — all active with the Fund for UFO Research) and I began contacting congressional offices who might have an interest in the case. We started with the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs and identified the Subcommittee on Investigations as our most worthwhile target. The deputy chief counsel, John Sopko, agreed to review the briefing paper and videotape and invited us to keep him informed of further developments. (He later told me, \"We won't be able to get into that,\" without explaining why.) T hen, we approached the Member of Congress whose district includes Roswell, Rep. Joe Skeen (R-NM), figuring that he would have to be interested, if only be- cause many of the events occurred in his district. His staff set up an appointment for us to see the congressman in his Washington office, but an abscessed wisdom tooth caused him to back out of the meeting. Instead, we met with his legislative assistant, Bruce Donisthorpe. We went over the case, and Bruce appeared to be inter- ested. He promised to review the materials we left be- hind with the congressman. To make sure the message got through, we decided to arrange for a meeting between the congressman and two of his constituents who were also principal wit- nesses: Walter Haut and Glenn Dennis (who, it turned out, both knew Rep. Skeen rather well). They agreed to make an appointment to see him in his district office. The appointment was put off for months, apparently by an over-zealous staff member who wanted to \"pro- tect\" the congressman. Finally, Walter and Glenn had their meeting, and Rep. Skeen was cordial — but non- committal. However, there was progress on the staff level. Bruce Donisthorpe mentioned the Roswell case (and my in- terest in it) to two staffers in the office of fellow New Mexico Congressman Steve Schiff: press secretary Mike Cook and legislative director Mary Martinek. Mary mentioned it to her husband, Karl Pflock; Karl in turn called me. When Karl contacted me in July 1992, the congres- sional initiative was — as far as I was concerned — MARCH 1994 NUMBER 31 1 PAGE 1 I"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL dead in the water and spectacularly unsuccessful. However, my hopes brightened somewhat when Karl in- dicated that Mike Cook was interested in the Roswell case. We agreed to get together for lunch and discuss the situation. It also turned out Karl was more than idly interested in matters Roswellian. As a relative newcomer to the UFO scene, I was unaware that in the 1960s, he had been an active member of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena and served as chair- man of the Washington chapter. He dropped out of ac- tive involvement in the UFO field in the early '80s, but maintained a continuing interest in the subject. Karl and Mike seemed hopeful that congressional action on Roswell was possible, so we agreed to col- laborate toward that end. I alerted the principal investi- gators about this new development and asked for their cooperation in getting signed affidavits from as many witnesses as possible, as well as any other documenta- tion that would support the case. B y August, Karl had arranged for a briefing with Rep. Schiff's staff and Monty Tripp, the minority counsel to the House Government Operations Subcommittee on Government Information, Justice and Agriculture, on which Schiff sat. We scheduled the briefing with Stan Friedman and one of the most im- portant witnesses: Jesse Marcel, M.D., son of the base intelligence officer who recovered a large amount of debris on \"Mac\" Brazel's ranch outside Corona. (Dr. Marcel is now a physician as well as a helicopter pilot and — ironically — a certified crash investigator for the National Guard.) As an 11-year old boy, Marcel had handled the debris and vividly recalled its unusual na- ture. The briefing went smoothly, and our primary audi- ence, Ms. Tripp, seemed interested. However, she re- sponded with a realistic assessment of our chances of getting the Congress to act on the matter, given the ex- otic nature of the subject. Later, we learned she dis- cussed the case with the director of the subcommittee staff and the ranking member of the subcommittee, who agreed that if Rep. Schiff wanted to devote staff re- sources to an investigation — and possibly, hearings — they had no objection. Infused with life, the congressional initiative went into full swing. Karl and I quickly worked out a coop- erative and productive relationship: he served as liaison to the congressional contacts, and I attempted to do the same with the investigators. I began work on a revised and expanded briefing pa- per, which would take into account all of the new evi- dence presented in UFO Crash at Roswell by Kevin Randle and Don Schmitt and Crash at Corona by Slan Friedman and Don Berliner. Karl and I also worked together on obtaining signed — and preferably sworn — affidavits from the \"new\" The Director for Plans and Operations In the Secretary of Defense's congressional liaison of- fice, Col. Larry G. Shockley, reportedly told the GAO Investigator who indicated an interest in the Roswell case, \"You've got no business getting into that.\" witnesses to include in the briefing paper, knowing that this would make a favorable impression on Members of Congress, which is largely comprised of lawyers. Most of the witnesses cheerfully complied. In addition, I launched a letter-writing campaign in an effort to get the Pentagon on record that they were stick- ing by the \"weather balloon\" explanation for the Roswell debris. Directing letters to my congressman and senators, I asked them to find out the government's current ex- planation for the debris and to get a current explanation for all of their actions taken. After a wearying exchange of letters, the pattern be- came clear: the Pentagon would refer the question to the National Archives, on the grounds that all of the Air Force's records from Project Blue Book were there; the Archives dutifully replied that the Blue Book files made no mention of Roswell, and referred the matter back to the Pentagon. The Pentagon then answered the question about the debris by reciting the conclusions of Project Blue Book. Apparently no one wanted to answer the question asked! (This exercise was by no means a waste of time, because it not only showed a pattern of evasion by the Pentagon; it also helped identify a number of po- tential congressional supporters.) By fall 1992, Rep. Schiff's staff had enough material to present the case to him. At the same time, he began receiving letters from witnesses from New Mexico and elsewhere (in response to our request), asking for a con- gressional investigation. Their heartfelt letters made the point that this incident had intruded on their lives and would remain a mystery until it was addressed by the Congress. Congressman Schiff decided to seek some answers. On March 11, 1993, he wrote to Defense Secretary Les Aspin, asking for a written report and a full briefing by Pentagon officials on the nature of the debris recov- ered outside Roswell in July 1947 and an explanation for the government's actions taken. There was no response. He then made a second request. The Defense Department's congressional liaison office (which han- dles requests from the Congress) tried to \"buck\" the matter to the National Archives, on the grounds that the subject dealt with UFOs, and all of the Air Force's UFO records from Project Blue Book were stored at the Archives. Fortunately, the congressman's staff was wise to the ploy and insisted on a response from the Defense Secretary's office. Finally, they got it (albeit an informal one): there \"were no records\" about Roswell in the Pentagon.

However, he needs our help to get the job done. In October, Rep. Schiff decided to take the matter up with the Comptroller General, Charles Bowsher, head of the General Accounting Office, which the House Government Operations Committee oversees. As a member of the committee, Rep. Schiff invited the Comptroller General to his office to discuss several matters that he wanted the GAO to look into. One of them was Roswell. Bowsher said, \"We've never done anything like this before. We mostly look into fiscal matters...but it sounds interesting. Why not give us a stab at it?\" Within a few days, Rep. Schiff's office received a call from a GAO in- vestigator specializing in military and intelligence mat- ters who said he was assigned to look into the case. The congressman's staff forwarded copies of his let- ters to Secretary Aspin and some of the documentation put together by Karl and me. At this writing (March 3, 1994), the GAO investiga- tion is in full swing. Initial indications are they have \"run into some roadblocks\" from officials in the Pentagon. The Director for Plans and Operations in the Secretary of Defense's congressional liaison office, Col. Larry G. Shockley, reportedly told the GAO investigator who indicated an interest in the Roswell case, \"You've got no business getting into that.\" That was exactly the wrong thing to tell the GAO, which is a creature of the Congress and is obliged to investigate any matter deal- ing with the federal government. So, there you have it. What began as a personal in- terest in the Roswell case (by Karl and me) became a professional interest (by Rep. Schiff's staff) and was transformed into an official interest (by the congressman and the GAO). The congressional inquiry into Roswell has begun. It is the result of sincere expressions of con- cern by the witnesses, hard work by Karl and myself, a level of cooperation by the investigators who provided some useful data, and — to a certain extent — timing and luck. Congressman Schiff is to be applauded for his polit- ical courage and his determination to get answers to the questions posed by new evidence in the Roswell case investigation. However, he needs our help to get the job done. Therefore, I am asking that if you support Rep. Schiff's request for a congressional inquiry: • Please write to him directly and tell him you sup- port the congressional inquiry into the Roswell case; the address of his District Office is 625 Silver Ave., S.W., Suite 140, Albuquerque, NM 87102. • Please contact your own Representative and Senators and ask them to write to Rep. Schiff in support of his efforts; send your letter to the U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC 20515, or the U.S. Senate, Washington, DC 20510. There are cynics in the UFO community who say this will be another useless exercise in fighting a massive government cover-up. To them I would point out that the circumstances this time are very different: (1) Unlike Project Blue Book (which was a low- level Air Force public relations exercise), this inquiry is being undertaken by the investigative arm of the Congress — whose members are responsible to their constituents. (2) Unlike previous congressional hearings on UFOs, this inquiry was initiated by a concerned, committed congressman who is acting on behalf of his constituents and won't take \"no records\" for an answer. (3) Finally, this is the first known official government investigation into the UFO subject in nearly 25 years. During that time, there have been congressional in- quiries into the Kennedy assassination, Watergate, the Iran-Contra affair, reports of American POWs in Southeast Asia, and government-sponsored experiments involving administration of radioactive substances to unknowing civilians. Perhaps soon to be added to the list will be the Roswell Incident.

They described a dark triangle, at least a mile high, that had an outline and appeared solid, with clusters of lights at each corner and at. or just aft of, the center. The leading-point cluster had all white lights, while the other clusters included white, red. green, and blue steady lights. The object took six to ten minutes to pass from horizon to horizon directly over the amazed spectators at Bradford, New Hampshire. Their excite- ment was recorded on the audio track of the tape, along with a sound likened to the sonar in submarine movies, but no images. Adult witnesses recalled a faint humming or jet aircraft-like sound as well.

You will want to share this book with as many people as possible, particularly those who have been less than tolerant of your interest in UFO's and extraterrestrial in- telligences. Although the book is not about UFOs per se, the arguments discussed regarding the artificial nature of the anomalous Martian land forms at Cydonia are, in essence, the last 40 years of UFOlogy in microcosm. On one hand, have overly enthusiastic individuals with wild imaginations used pseudo-scientific methods to erect a mountain of \"false\" evidence in support of fantastic, sensational and sometimes paranoid claims? Or, on the other hand, could a \"mountain\" of data and valid scien- tific evidence somehow be overlooked and generally ignored by authorities in the scientific mainstream be- hind an unjustified shroud of ridicule? Regarding the Martian Monuments and UFOlogy, the questions in both cases are the same, though the answers might be different. In either case, the truth may change humanity forever. According to a short biography, Stanley V. McDaniel is Professor Emeritus and former Chairman of the Department of Philosophy, Sonoma State University in Rohnert Park, California. With a thirty year background teaching philosophy at the university level, including courses in Logic, Critical Thinking, Philosophy of Sciences, and Ethics, he has developed an innovative method for teaching logic using his own textbook, Logic and Critical Reasoning. Dr. McDaniel is the founding vice-president of The Foundation for Critical Thinking. Dr. McDaniel is quite skilled in the art of thinking and writing clearly. And The McDaniel Report cogently an- nihilates every argument that NASA has raised against the possibility that the Cydonia anomalies on the planet Mars are anything more than natural formations. After discussing written spurious arguments made by an anonymous NASA author McDaniel refers to as \"Mr. Q\", Dr. McDaniel writes: \"What is accomplished by Mr. Q's argument here is an illusion of critique, while in reality there is no sig- nificant critique at all. This procedure—to substitute an illusion of critique for substantive discussion — is the basic characteristic of just about every NASA argu- MARCH 1994 NUMBER 311 PAGE 1 5"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL ment I have encountered in relation to the [possibly ar- tificial] land forms. What is especially disturbing about this is the fact that many people, even those in important oversight positions, appear to be willing to accept the il- lusion and to press the case no further, possibly for the simple reason that the idea of artifacts on Mars is some- thing many just do not wish to pursue. This factor makes it especially difficult to present genuine research on the topic and have it taken seriously.\" McDaniel maintains that while NASA rejected out of hand research carried out by independent investigators, NASA had not carried out any significant research of its own into the nature of these mysterious objects. His concern seems to be less that NASA could be wrong or might have made mistakes, but that even after being ap- prised of, and admitting to errors, the agency still dis- seminated this false and misleading information to mem- bers of Congress and the public. In the Preface the author writes: \"Mr. Hoagland set forth a disconcerting picture of the current situation vis-a-vis the Martian land forms. According to his ac- count, supported by copies of letters from key individ- uals associated with NASA, NASA had no intention of targeting these possibly artificial objects — despite the fact that the Mars Observer spacecraft carries a so- phisticated new camera capable of achieving resolu- tions from five to thirty-six times greater than the orig- inal Viking photographs. Furthermore, all photographs from the Mars Observer mission, except for a few se- lected by NASA for publicity purposes, were to be sub- ject to a six-month 'black box' period due to a propri- etary contract between NASA and the camera operator — a period during which, given modern technology, any photographs taken of the objects could be altered, 'misfiled,' or simply lost.\" F or 17 years the space agency has maintained that there were Viking photographs that supported NASA's contention that the \"Face\" was merely a trick of light and shadows, although these were never shown. According to McDaniel, \"As my study of the work done by independent investigators and NASA's response to their research continued, I became aware not only of the relatively high quality of the independent research, but also of glaring mistakes in the arguments used by NASA to reject this research. With each new NASA document I encountered, I became more and more ap- palled by the impossibly bad quality of the reasoning used. It grew more and more difficult to believe that ed- ucated scientists could engage in such faulty reasoning unless they were following some sort of hidden agenda aimed at suppressing the true nature of the data.\" [ital- ics mine] The McDaniel Report provides basic lessons in logi- cal reasoning and should be read by every serious stu- dent of UFOlogy who wants to develop credible argu- ments in favor of the reality of UFOs. Of special interest. the book includes a description of the Fractal Analysis that has been run and used to support the hypothesis that the \"Face\" in Cydonia is artificial. According to McDaniel, \"fractal analysis is based upon the finding that natural terrain tends to follow the rules of fractal mathematics, while artificial objects do not. Artificial objects tend to be mathematically deviant from the nat- ural terrain on which they lie.\" As an outgrowth of \"Chaos\" theory, fractal analysis has been used by the de- fense department to help differentiate artificial from natural formations on Earth during the Gulf War. Although McDaniel is careful to not suggest that the fractal analysis is \"proof of the artificial nature of the anomalous Martian land forms, his arguments leave lit- tle doubt in a previously open mind. If widely disseminated, The McDaniel Report could make quite an impact. The devastation at NASA from fallout due to the book is problematical. However, if in the end the process the book begets results in estab- lishing beyond a reasonable doubt the artificial nature of the \"Face\" and \"City\" on Mars, then the obvious ques- tions will lead right to the heart of UFOlogy.

Letters .to Mufon UFO Journal SCIENTIFIC CREDIBILITY Whether by design or coincidence, much of the December 1993 issue of MUFON UFO Journal was devoted to criticism of the work of ufologists. Budd Hopkins notes the poorly composed character of UFO investigators' communications. Dennis Stacy criticizes ufologists for taking a confrontational approach while focusing unnecessarily on the most controversial as- pects of the field. W. L. Garner chastises MUFON for not adhering to the scientific method. Even the one let- ter to the editor (David Gotlib) dealt with the need for more careful and accurate reporting by MUFON con- tributors. These articles suggest an increasing concern about ufology in general, and MUFON in particular. This con- cern is justified. As a hobby, ufology is doing just fine: but as a serious science, it is clearly at risk. Inaccurate reporting, inarticulate presentation, combative attitude.

It can choose to maintain its present course, or it can accept the challenge implicit in Gamer's article to seek greater compliance with MUFON's stated objectives. Recently, MUFON acted to remove as re- gional director an individual whose activities were deemed inconsistent with these objectives. The com- ments now appearing in the Journal suggest an aware- ness that this is not enough. Below, I offer several steps that MUFON may wish to consider if it chooses to ad- dress the problems now threatening ufology as a science. 1) Reconsider current editorial policy and standards for the MUFON UFO Journal. The Journal now exists to provide an essentially free forum for the expression of ideas. As such, it takes a mostly laissezfaire approach to article content and style (if this is not an accurate state- ment of editorial policy, based on the observations made in the the December issue, it at least appears to be so to many of the Journal's readers). I suggest an editorial pol- icy that addresses such problems as expositional style, unfettered speculation, and the use of innuendo or gra- tuitous ad hominem argument. I am not recommending a metamorphosis into a ref- ereed professional journal, just certain editorial stan- dards in the service of effective and useful communica- tion. In most publishing forums, editorial input is a commonplace, nearly always improves article quality, and although not always appreciated, is generally con- sidered a help rather than an impediment to the expres- sion of ideas. It is also commonplace that materials which do not meet the publisher's standards are not published. Admittedly, there is a certain \"politically correct\" appeal to the idea of letting anyone say anything they want, anyway they want to. However, an \"anything goes\" attitude is antithetic to the ideals of science. MU- FON may wish to consider whether it is more con- cerned with political correctness or with the advance- ment of scientific ufology. 2) Use the MUFON Symposium as an opportunity to enhance the image of ufology. Far too often, MUFON symposia are dominated by lurid tales and the latest exercises in rumor and imagination. Make the science of ufology the annual theme for all MUFON symposia. 3) Curb your commentators. MUFON has too many spokespeople who make MUFON look like anything but an organization concerned with the scientific method. Consider, for example, the following quotes appearing in the media during the last twelve months (as reprinted by the UFO Newsclipping Service): • \"I'm starting to suspect that Fox network is somehow supporting the government's covert educational pro- gram...to help us understand the larger reality repre- sented by UFOs.\" (MUFON state director) • \"One out of fifty Americans has been abducted by aliens...some people are abducted just to be there to calm down another abductee.\" (\"head of the local chapter of MUFON\") • \"A planet [Nibiru] carrying beings with superior technology will orbit the Sun near the earth sometime around the year 2000....UFOs are scouts from Nibiru....The [inhabitants whol came to earth mil- lennia ago...domesticated humans...and have geneti- cally manipulated humans 65 times....Cattle mutila- tions [however] are probably done by the CIA.\" (MUFON state section director) • \"There have been 47 abductions every hour in the U.S. for the last 45 years.\" (MUFON state director) • \"In exchange for information about the movement of the space vehicles, the U.S. government promised to allow the aliens limited access to human gene plasma...but the aliens did not keep the agreement.\" (MUFON \"researcher\") These statements would serve to undermine respect for MUFON and scientific ufology even if they had been expressed only as speculation or personal opinion. As assertions of fact, they suggest either no regard for, or no understanding of, the scientific method. MUFON has played an important role in the history of ufology and remains in a unique position to influence its future direction. I believe it can help steer ufology along a more scientifically founded course without sac- rificing its fundamental character as an organization committed to the open exchange of ideas. But this will require more than simply endorsing the goals of scien- tific ufology. It will require a deliberate decision to re- pudiate, condemn and withhold support for publica- tions, comments and activities that are inconsistent with these goals. I encourage MUFON to consider such a de- cision.

No UFO costuming will be allowed — no T-shirts, hats, masks or other parapher- nalia which might lead to press ridicule will be permit- ted.\" BEFORE YOU DEMONSTRATE... By Fred Whiting O peration Right to Know has asked me to provide suggestions on alternatives to public demonstra- tions as a means of forcing the government to release its UFO data. The following suggestions are based on nearly 25 years of experience as a broadcast journalist, Capitol Hill staffer, and public relations executive, and almost 15 years of active involvement in the UFO field. Let's all agree that there is a cover-up of information about UFOs by the federal government. Let's also agree that there's no such thing as \"THE government,\" in the sense of a creature which speaks with one voice and knows what both the right hand and the left are doing. In fact, the government is a disparate collection of com- peting agencies, each with its own agenda — influ- enced in part by political appointees who last for a short time, and a bureaucracy which seems to hang on forever. What we may not be able to agree on who is respon- sible for the cover-up and how to go about ending it. But consider the following: There are two possible allies in this battle: Congress and the media. Congress, because it holds the purse strings of all federal agencies; the media, because they influence public opinion, which drives the Congress. Treating these potential allies as if they were the en- emy is self-defeating. Picketing the office of a Member of Congress only alienates the Congressman and his staff. Berating a reporter for writing what you perceive to be a negative story about the UFO subject or its ad- herents does not encourage the reporter to correct her \"mistakes\"; nor is it likely to result in a more favorable article the next time around. Therefore, it is necessary to work with — not against — the Congress and the media in our attempt to solve the UFO mystery. We must play the game according to their rules. So what are their rules? Members of Congress are responsible to their con- stituents. With few exceptions, they will take action only if they think it is politically safe to do so. They live in fear of doing or saying something that will come back to haunt them at the next election. They are par- ticularly fearful of ridicule, because there is no defense against it. On very controversial issues, Members of Congress try to avoid taking sides, because that means they alien- ate a voter for every one they please. Therefore, they are open to suggestions of a government cover-up, as long as no one thinks they \"believe\" in UFOs. The media, likewise, are very self-conscious about their reputations. Reporters write stories primarily for their editors and their peers, not their readers; few jour- nalists want anyone to think they take \"kooky\" sub- jects like UFOs seriously. Although they like to exploit extremists on both sides of an issue, they think of them- selves as neutral, so as to avoid the appearance of \"tak- ing sides.\" However, they, too, are more aware than ever of governmental abuse and secrecy. What both the Congress and the media need is con- crete evidence of a government cover-up. They need to be educated about the UFO subject. They need to know about the thousands of pages of government documents released under the Freedom of Information Act that in- dicate the military and other federal agencies have taken UFO reports quite seriously. They need to know about the thousands of credible witnesses who have reported unconventional aerial craft which defy the laws of physics as we know them. They need to know about the many scientists and other professionals who are ac- tively involved in UFO investigations. In short, they need facts — not allegations. Therefore, before you consider conducting a demon- stration in front of the office of a Member of the House or the Senate, the Pentagon, or a newspaper, I suggest you do the following: (1) Write a sincere, articulate letter to your congres- sional representatives about why you think the UFO subject is important and what they can do about it. Be specific: \"End the cover-up!\" will fall on deaf ears, be- cause the congressional staffer who is assigned to an- swer your letter knows nothing about a cover-up and wouldn't have the slightest idea how to end it, even if she wanted to. (2) Offer to conduct a briefing for the congressman or senator in their district office closest to you. Bring a credible witness to a UFO sighting. Prepare a summary of the history of the government's involvement in the UFO phenomenon.

This dazzling planet neighbor of ours pairs up with the lunar crescent on the 12th; Venus will hang very close below the Moon after sunset. By the next evening, the Moon will have moved 1 1° above the planet, still presenting a beautiful sight. Jupiter, in Libra, rises in the ESE about 8:30 PM in mid- month and proceeds across the southern sky. On the night of April 25-26, the gas giant lies only 3° above the full Moon. Jupiter arrives at opposition (exactly opposite the Sun) on the 30lh, shining at magnitude -2.5 and remaining visible all night. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars ( 1 .2), in Pisces, rises less than an hour before sunrise and remains difficult to see low in the E. Jupiter sets in the WSW by sunrise. Saturn ( 1 . 1 ), in Aquarius, gradually improves its position but still is difficult very low in the ESE at dawn. The crescent Moon lies above the planet on April 7. Meteor Shower: Radiating from a point SW of Vega in the constellation Lyra, the Lyrid meteors must contend with a bright gibbous Moon this year on the maximum night of the 2lst-22nd. The heav- ens, however, will be dark for about half an hour just before and after 4 AM. Though Hashing across the sky at a rate of only about 15 per hour, the Lyrids' white-hot brilliance and occasional lasting glowing wakes make up somewhat for their paucity. Moon Phases: Last quarter — April 2 New moon — April 10 First quarter — April 18 Full moon — April 25 (Nearest Moon of 1994. Extra high tides.) The Stars: The spring sky symbol Leo the Lion crosses the celestial meridian high in the S during midevening in mid-April. Look for his prominent curved head and mane formed by tile Sickle. and his heart, the star Regulus. Leo separates the spring star patterns behind it to the E from the waning winter constella- tions to the W. To the left of the lion's tail (the star Denebola), look for the wig of Queen Berenice's long hair — a wedge-shaped loose cluster of some two dozen stars called Coma Berenices. According to legend, the Queen of Egypt, Berenice (a real his- torical figure), vowed to cut off her hair and dedicate it to the goddess of beauty if her husband returned safely from battle. This she did and as a reward for the deed, the gods placed the queen's tresses among the stars. If you have a clear southern horizon, this is a good time to try to trace the outline of the largest and one of the faintest con- stellations in the sky, Hydra the Sea Serpent. Its head, a circlet of stars, can be found below Cancer in the SW (midevening). The serpent then winds its way eastward below Leo, Crater the Cup, Corvus the Crow, and ends beneath Virgo in the SE. Hydra's brightest star is a barely conspicuous 2nd-magni- tude orange object, Alphard (\"solitary one\") located to the lower right of Regulus.

FIELD INVESTIGATOR'S MANUAL OUT OF PRINT The third edition of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual is temporarily out-of-print. It has been removed from the MUFON Publications List. Work is progress- ing very well on publishing an expanded version to be identified as the fourth edition in the near future. Please do not delay conducting Field Investigator training classes due to the absence of the fourth edition. Some sections or chapters of the present manual are only be- ing updated, whereas new sections on abduction inves- tigations, animal mutilations, crop circles and poly- graph will be new. Explicit instructions on completing Form 1 and Form 2 will also be new. An expanded sec- tion on interviewing witnesses by Dan Wright will be an asset to the new manual. The availability date and price will be announced in the Journal. Please do not back order the new manual, since it will be doubled in size and the price has not been determined from the printer. We are excited about the fourth edition, since it will be a state-of-the-art pub- lication. UFO SLIDE SET Only eleven sets of the MUFON 35mm introductory UFO slide shows are still available at $20 per set ac- cording to John W. Komar, 1510 1st Avenue. North, St. Petersburg, FL 33705. Presently, there are no plans to reproduce this 20-slide set, so please order immedi- ately. Your check made payable to MUFON will be re- turned by John after the eleven sets are sold. DIRECTOR OF LEGAL AFFAIRS RESIGNS It is with deep regret that MUFON accepts the resigna- tion of Kenneth A. Wong, J.D. (Costa Mesa, CA) as Director of Legal Affairs on the MUFON Board of Directors after three years of dedicated volunteer legal service. Mr. Wong has directed MUFON's legal staff of over 30 attorneys. A search will be initiated immedi- ately to seek a replacement. Your International Director would be very receptive to inquiries from any of our le- gal staff who would be interested in filling this impor- tant post. The Board of Directors is going to miss Mr. Wong's intuitive judgment and legal advice, especially at the annual board meetings. CENTRAL REGIONAL DIRECTOR ELECTION After making a miraculous recovery from a serious ill- ness and being reelected to the Board of Directors, Shirley A. Coyne has advised that the health of her husband, George R. Coyne, has deteriorated to the point where he cannot adequately fulfill his responsi- bilities as the Central Regional Director. We extend our prayers to George during his hospital confine- ment. The following three State Directors have agreed to be candidates for the remaining three years of Mr. MARCH 1994 NUMBER 31 1 Continued on Page 22 PAGE 23"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Dl RECTDR1S.MESS AGE Walter Andrus 0 ° 1l 6 NEWS FROM AROUND THE NETWORK NEW OFFICERS The new Representative for Israel is Miss Ofra Ben- Shetrit, B.A. (Givatayim) who is a photographer and involved with film and TV productions.

NEW HAMPSHIRE TOP STATE In the January 1994 issue of the Journal, it was report- ed that Delaware had the highest percentage of MU- FON members versus population at .006%. Peter Geremia, New Hampshire State Director, pointed out that his state registered a .0071%, making it number one. Mr. Geremia and his Assistant State Director, Walter Friesendorf, probably achieved this favorable position due to their annual UFO conferences. Your Director extends his apology to Pete's outstanding team in New Hampshire.
