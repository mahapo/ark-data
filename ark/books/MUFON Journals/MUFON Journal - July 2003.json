In my twenty years of UFO investigations, I have uncovered only a handful of these types of very close encounters. Surprisingly, in the vast majority of these encounters, there is little or no conversation between the humans and the aliens. In the cases where __^__________ there is conversation, it is often one-sided and limited to the ex- traterrestrials giving platitudes to the frightened witnesses. It's the same phrase over and over again-almost like a broken record. The first word out of the aliens' mouths (or minds) is invari- ably, \"DO NOT BE AFRAID. WE WON'T HURT YOU.\" While the aliens are usually very tight-lipped, occasionally they will engage people in brief conversations or relay brief mes- sages. CASE ONE: \"You won't remember this.\" My first case involving conversations between humans and ETs was with the Robinson family of Reseda, CA. In 1989, the family experienced a series of sightings and abductions by gray-type aliens, culminating in what UFO investigators call \"a baby presentation.\" The main witness, Kelly Robinson, experienced four consecutive visitations over a period of a few months. During each encounter, she was able to converse with the aliens. On the first encounter, Kelly awoke to find four gray- type ETs standing around her bed. One spoke telepathi- cally, telling her.\"Do not be afraid. Come with us. You won't remember this.\" Kelly, however, was a very feisty, independent twenty- year-old, and like twenty percent of abductees, she did remember. She recalled being taken into a small round room and placed on a table. They told her, \"We're going to take your memory away. You'll not remember this...Don't be afraid. We're not going to hurt you. You can't remember this.\" Kelly screamed at them, \"Yes, I will!\" This argument went back and forth, with the aliens telling her she couldn't and wouldn't remember, and Kelly screaming back that she would. They then cut her arm. She woke up the next morning and immediately looked at her arm. A neat two-inch scar was exactly where she remembered the aliens cutting her. Two weeks later, the aliens returned, telling her, \"We're About the author Preston Dennett, a field investigator for MUFON, has written numerous articles for the Journal and other pub- lications. His books include UFOs Over Topanga Can- yon, as well as UFO Healings and One in Forty: The UFO Epidemic. Several of the cases mentioned in this article are included in his latest book, Extraterrestrial Visitations: True Accounts of Alien Contact, which is available from Llewellyn Worldwide, P.O. Box 64383, St. Paul, MN 55164-0383, www.llewellyn.com, for $12.95. going to take your memory.\" Kelly screamed at them, \"No, you're not. I'm going to tell.\" They told her, \"No, you're not....Your parents wouldn't understand. You better not tell them, you know.\" Kelly screamed out that she would tell her father. They said, \"No, no, no! You can't.\" A few weeks later, they came again. As usual, they attempted to erase her memory of the incident. They told her, \"You're going to forget everything.\" However, as usual, Kelly had some recall of the events. Says Kelly, \"I don't know specifically what they asked me. They were asking me things about what we do, but you know, I can't specifically say. They [said,] 'this will happen and that will happen.' I think it's about my job or something.\" Says Kelly, \"It's hard for me to remember. They say, \"You're going to forget everything.'...It's totally stressed on, 'We're not going to let you remember this. We're going to take your memory of this away.'\" On her final encounter, the aliens appeared and said, \"We need to talk to you. Come with us.\" Kelly resisted and threatened to tell her father. They said, \"No, you can't tell your dad.\" Says Kelly, \"I think they're religious. They're not re- ally out to hurt us. They're out to learn. But they're afraid for us to remember, because they're afraid we would tell people about them.\" CASE TWO: \"They have everything but love.\" Kelly Robinson's mother, Diane, had an experience which she calls a \"dream,\" but it is clearly connected to the UFO encounters of her family. Diane recalls being taken into a room where she was shown babies who were genetically altered. First revealed by researcher Budd Hopkins, these rare cases involve abductees who are told to hold and nurture babies that appear to be half-alien and half-human. In most cases, there is little information exchanged. Diane, however, was given a brief explanation. She recalled being taken to a room where she saw a large contraption shaped like a Christmas tree, but in- stead of branches there were incubators filled with ba- July 2003 MUFON UFO Journal PageS"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"bies. Diane was told to pick a baby and hold it. She re- fused because the babies appeared to be deformed. Says Diane, \"Every one of them had something wrong with them.\" And the entity who showed her the babies said it was sad, because it wasn't planned that they had all these things wrong with them. \"She said they had ev- erything but love. She said, 'That's why I'd like you to take one and love it....They have problems. They are dif- ferent. But they still need love.'\" Diane was unable to overcome her revulsion, and re- fused to hold the babies. Following this experience, all the UFO encounters of the Robinson family ended. CASE THREE: \"There's going to be a rebellion.\" During my research into the UFO wave over Topanga Canyon, California (see UFOs Over Topanga Canyon, Llewellyn, 1999), I uncovered several cases involving face- to-face extraterrestrial encounters: Again, in most cases, the aliens either didn't speak or said only, \"Do not be afraid; we won't hurt you.\" However, in a few cases, messages were given. One case is that of the Martin family: It was Sarah Martin, the mother, who actually spoke with the extraterrestrials. Sarah Martin's encounters occurred during the peak of the UFO wave and involved several close-up sightings and at least one onboard encounter. Sarah recalls being inside a small circular room surrounded by. small robed figures. Says Sarah, \"To be honest with you, I can't remember their faces. I just remember talking to them...and they were talking to me. And this is what they said: 'Why are you so involved in this [Ross Perot] campaign? Why are you wasting your time? It's going to fall apart, one by one, and whoever wins, it doesn't matter because the whole system is going to come down around everybody. There's going to be a rebellion. And you're not a part of this, so don't get involved.'\" At the time, Sarah was heavily involved in the Ross Perot presidential campaign. After the experience, she dropped all her political activities. Says Sarah, \"This was so incredible. In my mind, I keep going over again what they said: 'You're not a part of this, so don't be a part of it. Get away from all of it.'...The other thing too is some- thing about an earthquake, a big earthquake. Something like that...but the thing that stuck out the most was, 'Why are you so involved? Why are you letting this consume your time? It's not worth it, and it's all going to fall apart.'\" A few years later, the devastating Northridge earth- quake struck, destroying several homes in Topanga Can- yon. CASE THREE: \"We need babies.\" Interestingly, another Topanga witness received pro- phetic warnings of the Northridge earthquake the night before it occurred, thereby saving her from serious injury or even death. Marcellina X had had encounters all her life, but it wasn't until she moved into Topanga Canyon that she began to experience face-to-face visitations. Following the earthquake, she had an encounter with a gray-type extraterrestrial in her home. During the encounter, the ET spoke to her telepathically. Says Marcellina, \"It was telling me they were trying to invent ways of intercourse. They needed babies. It was just telling me a bunch of things telepathically. There would be more earthquakes. And then you know, we had all those earthquakes all over the world....! had changed my living room after the earthquake with a whole bunch of pictures I had painted of planets. And they told me that's not exactly the way it looked there...[they said] I would be able to heal myself and I would be able to heal them. If they wanted me to heal them, I would be able to heal them.\" Following this experience, Marcellina experienced the missing-fetus syndrome. Well known among UFO inves- tigators, this syndrome involves women who become preg- nant following a UFO encounter and then mysteriously lose the fetus. Marcellina also experienced subsequent paranormal healing events. CASE FOUR: \"Our emotions are different.\" Pat Brown is a physical therapist from Panorama City, CA. She had never thought of UFOs until 1992, when a vacation to Arizona triggered a series of encounters with gray-type extraterrestrials. For a period of several months, Pat reported terrifying nightly visits by ETs in her condo. Then, one evening, she was taken on board. To her surprise, she found the experience enjoyable. She was given a tour of the craft and taken to meet \"the master.\" It was then that she was given several mes- sages of a spiritual nature. Says Pat, \"I don't know all that they said to me, but I remember them telling me there was something I had to do with my aura.\" She was surprised to find that the appearance of the alien had changed to a human male with blond hair. She asked, \"Why do you look like that?\" The ET replied, \"Be- cause this is the way you want me to look.\" Pat was taken out of her body and was shown what her astral body looked like. The ET told her, \"That is your soul. That is the part of you that goes through all the life- times.\" Pat was given further spiritual lessons on vibra- tions and healing and was then returned to her bedroom. She soon had further experiences, and suffered sev- eral medical effects as a result of her encounters. Her case is also supported by additional witnesses. Her ob- session with the subject grew, and Pat began a search for information. She was led to a channeler, someone claim- ing to speak for the ETs. Pat asked the channeler if people who are abducted make an agreement on some level. The channeler, speak- ing for the ETs, said that, yes, abductees do, in fact, agree to be abducted. Pat said, \"Can you make them stop?\" The ETs replied, \"No, you cannot make them stop, but if you become consciously aware, you will be handled in a different way...You need to understand why you have created this. We perceive we are supporting you in your drama. Why did you create this?\" Another audience member asked, \"You come here and you get specimens. What do we get from you?\" \"You get a jump start in your growth; That's what we Page 4 MUFON UFO Journal July 2003"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Copyright 1991 Christine ' Kesara\" Dennett Not the best technique. give you.\" Another member asked about emotions, and the ETs replied, \"Our emotions are different than yours, but we do have emotions because we accept it as impor- tant to us.\" The conversation continued until Pat became angry and shouted at them that they shouldn't take her against her will. The ETs replied, \"The experiences you are re- ceiving from this far outweigh the other things you are experiencing, and there's not one person in this room that would not trade places with you.\" Pat continues to have experiences, both positive and negative. She is also continuing her quest to understand the reasons for her encounters. CASE FIVE: \"We are from a place you don't know about yet.\" In 1995, a middle-age couple, William and Rose Shelhart, were driving outside Sedona, AZ, late at night when they spotted a bright light in the sky following them. It soon became apparent that the light was playing a game of cat and mouse with them as it chased them down the road and eventually landed in a field next to them. That was the last thing they consciously remembered. Their next memory was arriving at a hotel in Sedona, several hours too late. Realizing they had missing time, they later sought out a hypnotist and recalled an incred- ible onboard UFO experience. They recalled being taken on board the craft and ex- amined by nearly human-looking uniformed extraterres- trials. While William's recall was negligible. Rose was able to recall most of what happened, including an actual conversation that she had with the ETs. According to Rose, they were \"invited\" onboard and treated with kindness and respect. Says Rose, \"They [the extraterrestrials] were just saying that we are helping you. They told me [William] was in another room getting dif- ferent messages.\" Rose asked where they come from. The aliens gave a typically enigmatic and evasive answer, replying, \"We are from a place you don't know about yet.\" When asked about their purpose for coming here, their response was decidedly positive. Says Rose, \"They said they are helping certain people here because they will help humanity. And something about like, the more we help, the more they help us. But they can't interfere and just take over and fix everything.\" Rose was unable to obtain any further useful informa- tion. She and her husband continue to have sightings and encounters, and William reports that he was healed of carpel-tunnel syndrome as a result of his interaction with the ETs. CASE SIX: \"Don't worry; we won't hurt you.\" Jack Stevens (pseudonym), of Everett, WA, was only twelve years old when he was abducted out of a car and into a large craft. Most of the event was shrouded in amnesia until 1997, when he spontaneously recalled what happened twenty-five years earlier. His memory revealed a harrowing six-hour-long abduction event. Jack recalled being levitated inside a beam of light and laid out on a table surrounded by short figures. As he was being taken on board, the ETs told him, \"Don't worry, we're not going to hurt you.\" As they examined him, Jack reports that the aliens con- versed among themselves. \"I remember two of them go- ing back and forth, and it was like a 'good cop, bad cop' thing. One of them, for all he cared, would just throw me off. That's what the impression was, just 'get him off here.' And the other one was saying, 'No, we are not going to do that.' I remember them telling me to open my mouth.\" Jack became nervous about his mother and brother, who were still back in the car. The beings responded, \"Don't worry about it; we don't want them...Don't want them, don't need them....We don't care about them.\" At one point, one of the beings attempted to relate a complex message. Says Jack, \"He was telling me all kinds of stuff, but it wasn't sinking in. I didn't understand what he was telling me. There were math formula things and something about a lot of triangles and circles. There was a lot of geometry thrown at me. And I'm just sitting there thinking, this is pretty cool, but I kind of want to go home.\" After several more procedures, the encounter finally ended. As Jack was being placed back into his car, a final exchange ensued. Jack said, \"You didn't do anything to my mom and brother, right?\" The beings responded, \"Right, don't worry.\" Jack's case involves considerable physical evidence and numerous other witnesses. The case is still ongoing. CASE SEVEN: \"We've been here a long, long, time.\" A very unusual case of extraterrestrial contact occurred to a waitress named Maryann X, of Carpinteria, CA. One evening in 1992, following a series of UFO sightings, Maryann was in her home watching TV when she be- came aware of a presence. Although she couldn't see July 2003 MUFON UFO Journal PageS"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"anything, in her mind's eye she sensed a strange being. The figure was thin, bald, with a large head, gray skin and dark almond-shaped eyes. In other words, the typical gray- type alien. At that point, Maryann began to experience the phe- nomenon of automatic writing. Messages which she be- lieved were from the alien began to be transmitted through her. Says Maryann, \"He's very interested in our interest in him and his race. [He says] that they've been here for a long, long time, longer than we have from what I understand....They're vastly interested in us. They're al- most more fascinated in us than we are in them. We don't think the same way they do. He said, 'We live in oceans.' They live in the ocean, underwater. Their ships are un- derwater. They're very benign. They have no nuclear warheads [or] this kind of stuff.\" Like many contactees, Maryann was given informa- tion about upcoming natural disasters. \"He was telling me something about earthquakes. He didn't predict anything else. He just said we're in for some big type of natural disaster. I get the impression, thinking back to what he talks to me about, is that they're almost here to warn us. Not of an impending doom type of thing, like the world's going to blow up, but they're not here to hurt. They're here to observe.\" The alien told Maryann that their race is much more numerous than all of humanity. \"Lots and lots and lots. This is not just five or ten or twenty ships roaming around. We're talking-from what I get from him-millions and mil- lions of these people. And they've existed before we re- corded time and history.\" The alien told her that they were conducting a pro- gram to contact small groups of people across the planet. \"That's the understanding I have. They have jobs like everybody has jobs down here. His job is to find people who are receptive enough that he can talk to. And he was really worried about whether or not I was really scared....! get the impression that I am not the only one he talks to. That's kind of the impression I got, is they kind of probe different people.\" Marianne has made contact with the alien on several occasions, and has been given much more information. CASE EIGHT: \"It is very important we do this.\" Melinda Leslie of Los Angeles, CA, is an Office man- ager and secretary who has been having ET contact her entire life. Even more amazing is that Melinda has been able to recall many of her experiences consciously, with- out the aid of hypnosis. She is what UFO researchers call a conscious abductee. While she has had virtually the entire range of UFO experiences, one of her most dramatic occurred in July of 1991 while driving with two friends through the Los An- geles forest. All three experienced a two-hour-long ab- duction into a metallic craft piloted by gray-type ETs. Once on board, they were undressed, examined, sepa- rated and given separate messages. Melinda was able to recall the entire event consciously. As she was laid out and examined, she hammered the aliens with questions, Page 6 MUFON UFO none of which they answered. She saw her friend sitting in a chair with a bizarre-looking headset on him, and she screamed out, \"What are you doing to him?\" One of the aliens replied, \"It's all right; we're giving him information. It's all right. We're educating him.\" \"Don't hurt him,\" Melinda said. \"We're not hurting him. He's all right. It's all right.\" Melinda continued to let out a stream of questions, but she was rarely answered, and then, only in an evasive manner. Says Melinda, \"They don't give you straight an- swers. They say, 'It's okay. We need to do this. You un- derstand.'\" At one point, the three friends were separated and placed into different rooms. Melinda found herself in a room with a dozen greys. One stepped up to her and said, \"Now, we're going to do something. Don't be afraid, but this is very important that we do this. We're going to put this over your head.\" What followed was a bizarre procedure. Melinda was immobilized by a device placed over her head. The aliens stood in a circle around Melinda and pushed her back and forth like a punching clown. Melinda felt she was going to fall, but each time she was caught and pushed again. Fi- nally, she relaxed. At that point, they stopped and removed the device. One of the aliens said, \"You needed to learn that...;You needed to learn to trust us.\" Meanwhile, Melinda's friend, James, was receiving a different message. Says Melinda, \"James said when I was out of the room, they came over to him, and they showed him a device, a bunch of stuff. They told him how to make a UFO detector, and they gave him the information. He said they said they did this because they wanted him to document and videotape them. When sightings happen, they told him he has a mission to docu- ment this stuff.\" According to James, \"They showed me how to do this. And they explained the whole thing technically to me, and I was given the information how to build those. They were done and they made sure I understood. And I said, 'Yes, I understand.'\" Melinda's other friend was unable to recall much de- tail, other than being taken onboard and examined. Melinda continues to have experiences and has lectured exten- sively about her encounters. CONCLUSIONS There are many other cases where aliens have con- versed with human beings. However, the patterns are usually the same. For the most part, aliens are not only extremely taciturn, they are often evasive. But as the above cases show, the aliens do sometimes reveal information about themselves, their feelings, their intentions, their de- sires, fears and beliefs. By piecing together these accounts, we are beginning to get a clearer picture of who the aliens are and what they are doing on this planet. The main message revealed by the aliens' conversations is that they have a strong interest in humanity. Whether they are removing genetic material, imparting spiritual knowledge, predicting natural disaster or studying our emotions, the aliens are obviously ipated by humanity.

It is the second of a two-article series for the maga- zine. The article is being printed as it originally appeared, except for the first two cases he described-the 1964 Lonnie Zamora case in New Mexico and the 2000 Illinois case involving police officers from Highland, Lebanon, Shiloh, Millstadt, and Dupo-since these cases are already familiar to Journal readers. Other state directors can perhaps do similar articles for their state law enforce- ment magazine, using Sheets or a local law officer as an example, and possibly describing one or two good cases involving police officers in their own states. Georgia law enforcement case recaps (Partial list) 8:45 PM, 28 APRIL 00, DOUGLAS GA MUFON of Georgia first learned of this event from newspaper articles in the' Douglas Enterprise newspa- per. Enterprise staff writer and noted columnist Lillian Williams and her husband, a 30+ years law enforcement veteran and retired deputy sheriff, of Coffee County, wit- nessed this event up close and personal. They were driving near Hwy 64 on this night when they observed a glowing round object hovering over the trees adjacent the roadway. They began to track it and watch, driving onto Hwy 64 and following the object. Upon closer examination, a bright band was noticed around the middle, with what appeared to be openings, seeming to allow a view through it to the other side. Esti- mated size was 24 feet in circumference. Shortly,.several smaller magenta-colored balls or orbs were ejected from the larger object, and they seemed to be connected by some sort of tether which seemed to disintegrate. These smaller orbs formed a sort of forma- tion around the larger craft. The Williams pulled off and Ms. Lillian got out to watch. The craft turned and flew across the road and ap- proached the Williams to within 50 to 70 feet. After 5 to 6 minutes, the larger object disappeared, leaving only the magenta orbs, which drifted away, causing nearby dogs to bark. The orbs then drifted totally out of sight. Another Douglas couple driving in the vicinity also re- ported observing the magenta orbs during the same time frame as the Williams. These,corroborating witnesses co- operated with MUFON by providing statements and other information to John E. Bodin Sr., who investigated this matter. He also serves as the MUFON Deputy Director for south Georgia and is on the POAG Staff. The Douglas, GA, sighting. 4:36 AM, 20 OCT 67, MILLEDGEVILLE PD LIEU- TENANT AND GBI AGENT The above two officers were proceeding up Hwy 22 east of town and observed an unusual light moving in the sky. They followed it and ascertained it was actually a red football-shaped light which disappeared from view. While heading back to Milledgeville proper, they no- ticed that the light had reappeared and was following the patrol car at very close range. The officers became con- cerned, since the object was then at about treetop level and seemed to be the size of a large water tank. The light from the object lit up the vehicle interior to the point that their wristwatch dials were visible. The situ- ation was called in to headquarters, and the officers stopped and got out to observe more closely. The object then veered away and again disappeared from view. Additional officers were notified, as well as the Milledgeville Chief of Police. This group set up two posi- tions and relocated the object. During continued observa- tion the craft changed color from red to orange and then to a brilliant glow like an electric welder, at one point changing shape into something like a four leaf clover. These observations were made by both groups while in constant radio communication. The craft finally rose up less than 1/4 mile from the Chief and sped away at great speed. The Chief described it as being about 40-50 July 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"feet across, possibly 30 feet high, and cylindrical like an old fashioned water tower tank, glowing yellow. To the east, officers from Warrenton, GA, also made similar observations during this time frame. Earlier in the night when the object first eluded the two officers on Hwy 22, Dublin officers reported seeing a craft traveling north to south from the area of Milledgeville. At 5:05 AM, of- ficers about 50 miles northeast of Milledgeville observed an object also changing colors. Toward night's end, offic- ers from Sandersville, Bowman, and Greensboro were also reporting similar events. Over the next several nights, officers from numerous central Georgia agencies had similar experiences. GSP from the Manchester patrol station reported an ice blue orb, as well as a rectangular object just above the trees; Fayetteville and Senoia observed two objects flying to- ward Griffin. Newnan officers received a BOLO [be on the look- out] from GSP, then located a hovering light and followed it, turning around and the light then following the patrol car at treetop level. The officers attempted to elude at over 70 mph, but the object caught up and then flashed a blue light beam onto the roadway before departing swiftly upward. On the night of Oct. 23 another object was observed over Milledgeville by Baldwin County deputies. A Cessna aircraft left the local airport piloted by a Forestry Service pilot who had a Sheriff's Dept. portable radio. The pilot observed a brilliant white object and pursued it, but the object easily moved away. The radar operator at Flight Control indicated he had two targets on his radar, the Cessna and the \"unknown,\" which was observed intermittently on the radar for about one minute. Various theories were later examined to explain these events around Milledgeville, even going so far as consid- eration of teen pranksters sending up burning candles in plastic bags. Some \"official\" government investigators also looked into these events, and seemed to feel that the of- ficers were just \"sleepy\" and were \"mistaking\" the planet Venus for an enormous UFO. Roswell PD Officer Michael Hitt, a MUFON of Geor- gia Section Director and investigator, has recently opened an in-depth review of the Milledgeville events and found NUMEROUS examples of the \"official\" government in- vestigators performing sloppy work and \"twisting\" the truthful facts that came from the astute and accurate ob- servations of the officers involved. His initial findings were published in the MUFON UFO Journal. SEPTEMBER 1973 Events such as those from 1967 erupted once again all over central, south and east Georgia in 1973 (as well as all over the USA, known as the \"Wave of 1973\" in our circles). Numerous GSP, sheriff's and police units were filing reports. A two-officer unit of the U.S. Army Military Police at Hunter Army Airfield was forced off the road by a diving unknown object. The diving object was actually witnessed by a Chatham County unit on an unconnected surveil- lance operation. This writer was at that time in the Patrol Division at the College Park PD and assigned to temporary adminis- trative duties due to previously shooting a barricaded gun- man (suspect DOA). While monitoring the incoming teletype traffic, I pulled off and saved the various Sig- nal-78 TT messages from around Georgia dealing with these UFO events. 9:32 PM, 13 SEPT 97, HWY 341, SOUTH CENTRAL GEORGIA This writer was enroute to an undisclosed location where police officers had reported seeing UFOs while on patrol at night. (The officers wish to remain anonymous, thus the venue will not be mentioned). These events in- cluded small glowing objects flying up to and being ab- sorbed by a larger object, and a glowing object hovering over the small local airstrip-on one occasion being ob- served through a rifle scope. While driving SE on 341, the night sky was clear with a few white patchy clouds several thousand feet up. I no- ticed the lights of a small aircraft on the southern horizon about one or two miles away. I continued to watch them while driving, also noticing a small white puffy cloud in the sky nearby. Suddenly a brilliant \"ray-like\" or laser-like blue beam with elements of orangeish gold in it projected out from behind the cloud as if it was just turned on. The beam was projected toward the aircraft, which continued to fly straight and at low level. The beam was extreme in col- oration and thickness, a deep and brilliant blue tending toward cobalt-purple with golden edges, giving the im- pression of someone looking into the heart of a nuclear reaction before the flash (this was a huge aerial display that really shook me up). This lasted two or more seconds, then seemed to click off. A futile attempt was made to read the aircraft num- ber in the glow of it's running lights, using binoculars as it flew past. This \"ray\" effect was not any form of summer light- ning or ball lightning with which I am familiar. Later ef- forts to discuss this with a meteorologist found no consis- tent weather phenomena. Consultation with MUFON associates revealed that this effect had been associated with the presence of true UFOs or their acceleration in past cases. 10:55 PM, 23 FEE 00 STATE JUVENILE DETEN- TION FACILITY, WRIGHTSVILLE GEORGIA A corrections officer patrolling the facility's perimeter road observed lights in the distance, low in the sky. He continued to watch as he moved his position around to the other side of the perimeter road. Over a period of 30 minutes the lights slowly approached and revealed a gi- gantic dark arrowhead-shaped triangular object lined with lights. The object passed right over the patrol vehicle at about 1000 feet in altitude, maintaining a slow and silent flight. The witness estimated the size was similar or larger than PageS MUFON UFO Journal July 2003"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The Palmetto, GA, sighting. that of an L-l 0 11 -passenger jet.

He continued to watch as it seemed to be an object traveling toward him at high speed. When it reached his immediate vicinity he could see that it appeared to be a round-shaped object, outlined by the red glow. When it passed over, he could see it at a different angle and saw that its side profile was more triangular, or a cone-shaped, with the red glow coming from its rear, which seemed to be spinning. The witness' sketch is like a thick, almost pointed, pro- jectile-almost like a .45ACP 230 gr. FMJ projectile, but shorter and more pointed in front). Size was described as about like a small house, and it flew by very quickly and quietly. The investigation was by Mary Dee Janssen, MUFON Section Director for the Rome area. Please note that MUFON of Georgia approaches each case much like a traffic accident or criminal investigation is handled. Witnesses are identified and interviewed, report forms similar to Code-5's are completed, sketches and diagrams are made, and photos/video taken. Follow-ups continue with calls to the local authorities, nearby military installa- tions, and the FAA. A complete field investigator's report is filed some weeks later.

Quantum entanglement successful A group of Austrian scientists has announced the first long-distance demonstration of \"quantum entanglement\" through a half mile of open space. While related to teleportation, the scientists say that teleporting ourselves through space appears to be far in the future, if at all. In quantum entanglement, two particles are put into the same condition, or state, and stay connected forever, mirroring each other's condition faster than the speed of light, regardless of how far they are separated. The term quantum refers to the ultra-small-the invisible particles which make up atoms. These subatomic particles follow different rules from objects in the visible world, a phe- nomenon that Albert Einstein called \"spooky.\" \"Being able to preserve quantum entanglement over large distances is a very important development in the possibility of using quantum mechanics to transfer infor- mation in a coded form from one place to another,\" said Dr. Lawrence M. Kraus, a physicist at Case Western Reserve University, who wrote the book, The Physics of Trek. \"However, we won't be teleporting ourselves any time soon. All of this relies on creating and preserving very specially prepared quantum mechanical states. And un- fortunately, we are not such states.\" It was the original Star Trek TV show, of course, which popularized the idea of beaming people through space-a feature of numerous UFO abduction cases.

Lang Date/Time of Sighting: 02 January, 2002, approx 5:30 PM CST Place of Sighting: Bloomington, MN Local Evaluation: Inconclusive-Possible Unknown Witness Description: The witnesses are a couple who live and work in the Bloomington area. The primary witness is a 25-year-old male. His health, vision, and hearing are all excellent. The second witness is his girlfriend. She is 22 years old and has excellent health and hear- ing. She describes her vision as less than great (some- what nearsighted). She was not wearing her glasses at the time of the sighting. Both witnesses indicate that they have had no health changes since the sighting. Both witnesses work at the same place, and both were there at the time of the sight- ing. Sighting Account: The primary witness had left work to run a quick er- rand at a nearby store in the same strip mall where he works. At about 5:30 PM CST, as he was walking be- tween locations, he looked to the southwest to observe a bright light which appeared to be stationary, about 45 de- grees up in the Southwestern sky. He felt that it was un- usual-not a star or airplane, and was curious about it. He watched it for several minutes as he walked back from his errand. The light was briefly obscured by a build- ing, and when it became visible again, he saw it at the same location. Along with the first light, a second light was now approaching on an east to west path from a location closer to due south. As he watched, the second light approached the first from the left (east) at a steady rate, and then merged with it. The first light remained at the same brightness, and in the same location. He ran into work to get his girlfriend (the second witness). They both stepped out- side to observe the light, which remained motionless in the southwestern sky. They observed it for slightly less than a minute more, as it rapidly faded out and was no longer visible. Object Description: The primary witness described both objects as solid white lights, about the brightness of the moon. It was not clear what this meant, and therefore what the actual brightness was. However, both witnesses felt that it was brighter than any stars present. He indicated that the lights had an observable diameter to them. The second witness described the object (one object only, since the two lights had merged by this time) as reddish and about the brightness of a star. She was not wearing her glasses at that moment, so could not discern any size to the object. She observed it suddenly vanish: \"It just wasn't there.\" Weather and Sky Conditions: The witness described the weather as clear and cold, with unlimited visibility and no clouds. It should be noted that the sun had just set, and the sky was still partly lit, especially in the southwest. This light would have been fading while they observed the lights Natural and man-made phenomenon check: No bright planets were in the southwest at the time of the sighting. Mars was nearly due south at an elevation of approximately 45 degrees, with a brightness of 0.8 mag- nitude. This could be considered as a null hypothesis, al- though the witnesses clearly stated the location of the light as southwest. Also, as a null hypothesis, the vanishing object might have been an aircraft with its landing lights initially visible to the witness, and which subsequently \"disappeared\" when the landing lights were either turned off or were no longer pointing in his direction. This does not explain the stationary object, however, which seems to have been stationary for too long a time to be explainable as an air- craft. It is also not clear in any null hypothesis how the rapid fade-out would have occurred at the end of the sighting. This factor and those described above suggest that the object(s) observed may have been unknown in nature. I have long regarded Stanton T. Friedman as one of the most outstanding of ufologists, but it is not clear just what the point is of some parts of his May 2003 column. If he is saying that James McDonald and J. Allen Hynek were very different people with very different ways of doing their work, I see no way one could quarrel with that, but it does not seem very necessary to mention it in a review of a book which is, after all, about McDonald and not about Hynek. If he means to say that we should have a higher re- gard, more respect for McDonald than for Hynek, then that is certainly a point of view which a person could reasonably hold. But if his point is that we should not respect Hynek at all and should not hold him and his work in high regard, then he is not convincing. I am sure that many people will, like me, continue to have high respect for J. Allen Hynek and what he did for ufology in spite of what Mr. Friedman has written. - -Dr. Richard P.

Object reportedly spins clock in England PORTSMOUTH — The witnesses were driving down a winding country road on May 15, 2003, and all of a sudden noticed a bright egg-shaped object in the sky at 9:37 PM. They report, \"It was darting from side to side, so we pulled over to look at it, as we knew from the speed and rapid direction changes that this wasn't any normal plane or helicop- ter. Within a few minutes the ob- ject came closer, and a bright light surrounded our car. The light was blinding, so we covered our eyes with our hands. \"I was squinting a look through my fingers when I noticed that the hands on the clock on the dashboard was spinning around really fast. This seemed to happen for only a short while, then the 'egg' suddenly disappeared, and we were left feel- ing a bit dazed and confused about the whole experience. This was definitely something not of this world. The clock on the dashboard has stopped working since then. MANSFIELD, NOTTINGHAMSHIRE — Two hours later, another witness was out in his backyard and spotted three spheres in the sky at 11:30 PM. The three spheres were tightly bunched and moved as one at a rapid pace in the sky, covering only what seemed a small area for about 15 minutes. At times the shapes seemed to change. The witness managed to obtain about 10 photos of the objects at dif- ferent stages, from stationary to moving. ( NUFORC Note: Witness elects to remain totally anonymous. PD) Strange figures reported in Illinois The reporting individual states, \"My sister and her friends described what they saw to me on May 2, 2003, after a party out at her house out in the country at 3:30 AM. There were almost twenty kids there. They had set a fire between the house and an adjacent field. The party wound down at around 2:45 in the morning. \"My sister, who is 17, and her two friends started to clean up. They were unloading some chairs when my sister saw a figure standing a little off the driveway by the house. She motioned her friend to look; they were a little scared, so they jumped into the van. Once in the van, they looked back up towards the house, and the figure was gone. July 2003 \"My sister described it as appearing to look like maybe it was a man, and it had lighter colored or white clothing on. Once the van was started, they all convinced each other that the figure or person was probably E's dad just checking up on them. They then headed back down to- wards the fire to resume cleaning. \"About 3:20 AM they headed up the driveway and into the grass, and down the hill towards the fire, which was still burning. The van's bright lights lit up \"frozen things.\" There were strange figures or creatures or something in two separate rows. She says maybe fifteen in each row, and thirty in all. \"She said, 'They were three feet to four feet tall.' They were directly in front of the car about fifteen feet away from them. She describes them as having a Christmas light head, and that the heads were connected to the body but she couldn't see how. \"She says their arms were up, but she couldn't see hands. She says they were stick like. Stick people she says, dark gray or brown in color. They didn't move. Not at all, she says. They were just frozen in these two sepa- rate rows. My sister immediately began to cry, and then both girls screamed for E to get the car moving. \"She peeled out and they headed to town. The girls drove around for two hours until they finally got enough courage to go back as the sun came up. She hasn't been able to sleep or eat, and when she told us what happened she could barley finish the story because she was fighting back tears.

Craft hovers over Texas neighborhood EL PASO — After delivering newspapers on May 14, 2003, the witness headed towards a friend's home at 4:30 AM.

Texas light makes circle ROUND ROCK — At 9:45 PM, on May 14, 2003, two amateur astronomers were looking at the rings around the moon and noticed a star at a 45-degree angle from the rings, which was very bright. The star suddenly started blinking on and off like a white Christmas light bulb. Says the witness, \"My friend and I determined it was not an airplane, for it was too high in the sky. We could see other aircraft flying, and suddenly the bright star took off in a northerly direction. \"It did not burn out like a shooting star, and within a few seconds it had traversed to the north, because I was looking at my watch to determine the time.

We saw this very weird thing moving from south to north. \"There were three green cigar-shaped flying objects.

The witness reports. \"It sounded like a plane was in trouble and about to crash. The other person on the phone lives about five kilometers away, so the noise covered a large area. \"I got up and ran to the window, and just above houses on the hill was a sort of cone or triangular-shaped object. I couldn't really tell, because it was dark; this was the shape I saw outlined in lights. The lights were red, white/ yellow, and green. \"They were blinking, and the object was quite large. It hovered for about 2-3 minutes and zoomed off quickly. It looked as if it were spinning so fast the colors of the lights combined. It vanished over the hills shortly after. There were several people who saw it: my brother, a guy from school, my father, and the person I was talking to on the phone could hear it. \"I'm sure there were others as well, but it only hap- pened last night, and I haven't been talking to many people who are possibly witnesses.

The family, who reported this sight- ing, said they were caught off guard by what they wit- nessed. A low and slow-flying triangular craft cruised from the east to the west from the direction of Mount Harry Davis, and continued on it's flight path over the mountains to- wards Grouse Mountain and the Smithers area. The ob- ject was longer than wide, and very large. Also there were a number of lights which ran along the underside of it, and close to the outer edge, but rather dim. It was completely silent, and dark in color. From the witnesses' vantage point from their home they guessed it took the object 15 to 20 seconds before it went out of their line of sight. HBCC UFO Note: I visited this family on the same day I met with the other folks who witnessed and re- ported their sighting, which was of a flying \"C\". Both the C-shaped object and this triangle sighting come from the same area west of town. Once again we have some very credible older folks who never saw anything like this be- fore.

The eyewitness is an engineer with the Necochea Power Station, belonging to the Centrales de la Costa Atlantica S.A. (CCASA) company. He claims the objects were of considerable size, white in color and were flying between 8:20 and 8:30 hours. The objects maneuvered in absolute silence, and vanished in the direction of Parque Miguel Lillo after flying over the Necochea beach resort. Necochea is once more a constant area of UFO manifestations.

They noted that 'thanks to the fact that they al- ready know us, and know that we research the subject, cattle ranchers inform us when mutilated animals are dis- covered. We then obtain samples which we send to the University of Buenos Aires and document everything on videotape.' , \"They referred to the two most recent cases-on May 16th and 17th. The first of these took place in the El Martin ranch, 45 km northwest of the Pampan capital, and involved a year-old calf weighing 200 kgs. \"On the left side of its head, the absence of the outer ear was evident, along with the entire inner ear, its eye, and an oval-shaped flap of skin measuring some 30 cm. in diameter. The absence of vulva, edge of the anus, lar- ynx, and pharynx and a segment of the trachea, as well as part of the upper muscular mass was also noted. \"The second calf was found on a rural property lo- cated 30 kilometers north of Santa Rosa.

UFO photos in the Netherlands AMERSFOORT — An extraordinary UFO sighting was reported on May 17,2003, when multiple witnesses saw some strange flying objects. A 36-year-old limou- sine driver took some pictures with his HP 620 digital camera. Around 13:45 he took notice of a large weird-shaped object in the sky with two smaller objects beneath it. The smaller objects seemed to be under intelligent control by the larger object in some way. The object appeared to be round-shaped and reasonably large. The distance between the witness and the UFOs was about 350 meters at 300- meter altitude. The strange objects were gray-black and didn't make any noise. They moved at a variable speed of about 30 km/h average, first south, then north. After ten minutes the UFOs disappeared over the horizon. The witness took three pictures of the strange flying objects that showed twenty perfectly round orbs that were not noticed by the witness during the sighting. Three orbs formed a triangular formation. Thanks to Toine Trust Site http://www.UFOPlaza.nl.

Reviewed by Katharina Wilson http://www.alienjigsaw.com K_Wilson@alienjigsaw.com Unlocking Alien Closets, the fourth book that Leah Haley has self-published, is a deeply personal and complex account of her life experiences. It begins where Lost Was The Kev ended in January of 1992, and ends in February of 2003. Leah Haley's life changed drasti- cally in 1990 when she remembered two encounters that had occurred many years earlier. One involved a sighting of an unidentified craft, and another involved non-human beings who took her aboard an alien craft and performed medical procedures on her. She was teaching accounting, was happily married with two children, and living what she considered a \"normal\" life. All of that changed after she re- membered these two events. She be- gan asking questions, and began look- ing into the possibility that she had en- countered non-human beings. She discovered that there appeared to be a group of humans, who she refers to as OMAGS (Obnoxious Military And Government Scoun- drels), who were very interested in her and the experi- ences she was remembering. Unlocking Alien Closets introduces a type of experi- ence, one that the late Dr. Karla Turner also wrote about, called VRE, or virtual reality experiences. Leah has also included in this book dreams and dream-like experiences that are related to the abduction phenomenon. She provides an overview of the main events that led her to publish Lost Was The Key, her first book. Unlock- ing Alien Closets covers a lot of new material that the reader will find very informative. I was impressed with everything she went through in order to find out what was happening to her and who was doing it, while con- tinuously trying to educate the public through her lectures, books, interviews, and articles. What struck me the most about this book is the deeply personal and painful life story Leah has shared with the public. The author herself describes part of this book as \".. .the high price 1 had to pay for going public with my experiences, and details my ongoing struggle to cope. It also discusses the spiritual ramifications of my encoun- ters.\" And indeed, she has had to pay-monetarily, emo- tionally, and physically. I knew of some of the debunking tactics that had been used against Leah over the years, but I was not com- pletely aware of the depths to which some of these people had lowered themselves. There are some shocking revelations in this book which I hope, rather than deterring other abductees from going public, will instead enlighten and teach them about the tactics that not only debunkers use, but some journalists, mental health care professionals, and even people within the UFO community. There are good people out there who really want to find the truth and want to help abductees, but there are many more who do not. Leah gives many examples of the way people misled her-even lied to her-but I have to admit, in her determi- nation to get the truth out and to help educate the public, she may have been somewhat naive in some of the choices she made. Leah learned some very painful, but important, lessons re- lating to this subject in her quest for the truth that will be valuable for other abductees to be forewarned about. The author goes into detail about what Marc Davenport (now her hus- band) presented in a paper that she wrote. It was about how marriages and relationships within the UFO commu- nity have been ruined or ended, only for one of the people to be thrust into the life and arms of another, who is usually also interested or involved in the phenomenon. This occurs to both researchers arid abductees. Leah shares many messages from what she calls \"the secret voice.\" One message from \"the secret voice\" told her about meeting her second hus- band. Marc Davenport. The sad ending of Marc's mar- riage, and then Marc and Leah happily falling in love and marrying one another follows this. Even though Leah was never quite sure if the secret voice was benevolent or trying to trick her, the rest is history. Leah and Marc continued working on their com- mon goal of educating the public about the phenomenon through their books by way of Greenleaf Publications and giving speeches and presentations. Leah relays abduction details that are familiar to the seasoned researcher and those who are well-read on the subject, but there are other types of experiences that will be new, and some that might be difficult for some people to connect to ET interaction. Leah asks many questions about odd occurrences throughout her life, many of which cannot be answered at this time. This book contains some questions and specu- lation that may have been related to coincidental occur- rences, but nevertheless, the events still had a powerful effect on her. She admits to not understanding everything that has happened to her, and to her credit, she states that she is not sure if everything she remembers is accurate. How- ever, putting all of the information \"on the table,\" so to Page 14 MUFON UFO Journal July 2003"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"speak, is what is important. I believe, as does the author, that this is necessary in order to find commonalities be- tween different cases and different types of experiences. The study of alien abductions has taught us that most abductees remember their experiences consciously. It has led us from sightings of unusual craft in the sky to contact with non-human beings. It has demonstrated to us mys- teries such as missing time, the ability of the aliens to use camouflage, mprphing, and invisibility techniques, as well as screen memories. And it has taken some of us, reluctantly, into a very dark place that most people simply do not want to believe is real. This is a place where abductees describe remember- ing seeing human beings wearing military uniforms, surgi- cal gowns, white physicians' jackets, or regular civilian attire. A place where guns are pointed into the faces of a few unfortunate abductees-a place where they remem- ber being threatened, interrogated, violated, or sometimes even aiding certain \"government\" people. It is a place and a set of circumstances that to most ufologists does not exist-it simply doesn't happen. There are some readers who are going to find this as- pect of her story difficult to accept, so perhaps sharing one theory she puts forth in Unlocking Alien Closets might help you to understand one possible motive of the people she calls the OMAGS. Quoting from her book: \"If I were conducting illegal mind-control experiments,- whom would I test them on?.. .1 would need to conduct them on unsuspecting members of the general population, just as some members of our military and scientific com- munity have done before. Who would be among the best- suited candidates for mind-control experiments? Alien abductees. \"Were I to use the right drugs, they should not remem- ber. But since everyone thinks they are crazy anyway, if they were to remember and were to start telling people they were victims of mind-control experiments, no one would believe them. If a [victim] did happen to be too credible, I could simply destroy her testimony by engag- ing in radical debunking ploys.\" A theory I have put forth is: what if some clandestine group in our government or a large corporation wanted to learn everything they could about the ETs? Short of cap- turing one themselves, the best way to do it would be to monitor someone they know is an abductee. They would learn everything they can about their sub- ject, and after an alien abduction, find out everything the abductee remembers, even if it means having to re-ab- duct them and drugging them to do it. Though these theories may seem far-fetched to some, the fact is, some abductees do report having been on mili- tary bases (above and below ground), and have seen mili- tary personnel with and without ET beings present. Is this alien deception-a simple screen memory? What if it is not? Do we look into it, or do we keep our mouths shut because it makes too many people feel uncomfortable? There are far too many unusual circumstances in Leah's life, and far too many unusual coincidences in this book, for the author to simply be paranoid and delusional or whatever label you wish to use. Yes, there are times when Leah even admits to being paranoid about her new husband Marc, but they resolve their issues and work through them. I don't know anyone who has been abducted by aliens and remembers seeing military people, bases, hospitals, etc, who hasn't wondered why they are remembering such things and question their sanity. Are these really just screen memories? Whether OMAG abductions or MILABs are really happening or whether it is alien deception, it is important to understand why and how they are being done. This is crucial in order to find out what the truth is behind abduc- tions. Leah Haley shares all of herself with the reader in this book-her conscious life experiences, her dreams, vir- tual reality experiences, the negative things people have done to her, and the positive things that have come out of her ordeal. Despite losing her first husband through a very sad divorce, losing the love of one of her children, losing her dream home, losing jobs, losing her health for a time, and losing a lot of money, she still managed to publish this book. She was resolute so she could continue to fulfill what she believes is the reason God put her on Earth-to educate the public about the alien abduction phenomenon- and the way for her to do that is to tell the truth about what has happened to her. Her belief in God and Jesus Christ is what I believe has gotten her this far. Her faith is very strong and has been important in helping her to conquer the negativity that comes with being involved in alien abductions and mind control-what Leah now believes is a form of spiri- tual warfare. Unlocking Alien Closets ends on a positive note with helpful advice to abductees, and although her experiences have not ended, Leah is on her way to a positive recovery from her ordeal with aliens and humans. Crop circles discovered in Arkansas wheat field Ten crop circles were discovered in a wheat field near Knobel, AR, on June 7 by pilot Bruce Catt. Aerial photos were taken by his daughter, Caleigh Catt. The ten circles were 10 feet apart and reportedly var- ied in size from 8 ft to 31 feet in circumference. The wheat crop was bent or broken (not established yet) and lying in a clockwise rotation. There were no prints or marks inside any of the circles. One circle had an undisturbed small bird's nest in wheat in the center. Todd Young, who was growing the wheat, harvested the crop and burned the field. He noted that the circles had created considerable aerial and auto traffic in the area, and reportedly stated that if he discovered any circles he would not tell anyone. It is not known if samples were taken prior to the har- vesting and burning. Veteran researcher JoAnne Scarpellini was scheduled to investigate for Nancy Talbott's BLT organization. July 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"It's in the book Firefighters, disaster control and UFO potential Balthaser By Dennis Balthaser That's an editorial title that should get your attention. It did mine several years ago, and I have finally obtained the book to review it. I had heard there was a Fire Officer's Guide used to train firefighters at the National Fire Acad- emy in Maryland that contained a chapter on UFOs. I couldn't help but ask myself, if all these rumors about UFOs were untrue, why would firefighters be trained on this, subject? And like so many other areas of my research, one question only produced other questions. In this case however, I now have a copy of the Guide and will share that information with you. In the near future I plan on re- searching Title 14, Section 1211, of the Code of Federal Regulations also to determine if a code existed which supposedly made it illegal for U.S. citizens to have any contact with ex- traterrestrials or their vehicles. (Origi- nally, it may have been written for our astronauts, and possibly more recently may have been repealed.) A co-author of the Fire Officer's Guide to Disaster Control, however, wondered if it pertained only to astro- nauts, or to anyone that may have had a UFO encounter. Our government and particularly the U.S. Air Force have been telling you and me for years that UFOs do not exist. Well, UFOs do exist; we just don't know what they are, whom they belong to, or where they are from. A UFO is any object that can fly and is not identifi- able. So if there are federal regulations or training guides being used, someone needs to explain to us why and for what purpose. The public should be told if there are dan- gers, since nothing helps rumors and panic more than ignorance. The Fire Officer s Guide to Disaster Control, Sec- ond Edition, (ISBN 0-912212-26-8) was published in 1992 and contains 641 pages. Two veteran Fire Officers, William M. Kramer, PhD, and Charles W. Bahme, J.D, wrote it. In my opinion this book would be an essen- tial part of any firefighter's training. It covers the full spectrum of disaster situations, from natural events such as weather related disasters to trans- portation, civil disorders and riots, and hazardous materi- als to training, preparation, and resource management. I don't recall ever, in all the conversations I've had with firefighters, any discussion about UFOs, so when I located the Guide my curiosity was aroused. The first edition, Handbook of Disaster Control, was published About the Author Dennis Balthaser served for three years (1959-62) with the United States Army in the 815th Engineering Battal- ion. After some 33 years in civil engineering, Dennis re- tired from the Texas Department of Transportation in 1996. Having been keenly interested in the Roswell Incident of 1947, Dennis decided to move to Roswell, NM, to pursue his avocation: ufology. Nine months later he assumed the duties of International UFO Museum and Research Cen- ter (IUFOMRC) Operations Manager, served on the Board of Directors, and became the UFO Investigator for the Museum as a full time volunteer. Balthaser is no longer affiliated with the Museum, and is now a full time independent researcher/investigator of the Roswell Incident, Area 51, and underground bases. He frequently lectures on these and other topics related to ufology. Balthaser, a MUFON Field Investigator, can be reached at 505-625-8402 or at truthskr@roswell.net. in 1952, and had no reference to anything related to the UFO phenomenon. Co-author Charles Bahme apparently felt that UFOs should be included in the second edition of his Disaster Control Guide, due to his own experience and interest in the subject. Chapter 13 is a dual chapter entitled \"Enemy Attack and UFO Potential,\" which explains what war is (a man-made disaster), and lists causes of war, as well as examples of different disasters which can be caused by war when nuclear, biological, and chemical attacks are used. Bahme says his interest in UFOs began on the morn- ing of Aug. 26,1942, in what became known as the \"The Los Angeles Air Raid of 1942,\" when he witnessed the \"fireworks\" display. The Army had announced the ap- proach of hostile aircraft, and the city's air raid warning system went into effect for the first time in World War II. Army forts along.the coastline began pumping the first of 1,433 rounds of artillery shells toward the intruders, utilizing searchlights to locate whatever it was they were firing at. Two hours later the threat no longer existed, and the incident is still questioned today. Note: The correct date of the LA Raid is Feb. 25,1942, not Aug. 26, 1942, as stated in the Guide, and it has be- come known as \"the Battle of Los Angeles.\" For more information go to http://www.rense.com/ufo/battleofla.htm Another reference made in the Guide by the author is the Orson Welles radio show, \"War of the Worlds,\" broadcast in 1938, which demonstrated that even a drama Page 16 MUFON UFO Journal July 2003"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"can provoke disaster-like conditions and panic by certain individuals, which in a real invasion would require first line response by fire services. Some have attributed widespread blackouts, commu- nication disruptions, and other potential disasters such as the 1965 power failure that blacked out New York and New England to UFO activity. Power failures associated with UFOs were also reported in Brazil from 1957 to 1959, in Rome, Italy, in 1958, and in Mexico in 1965. In September and October, 1995, while I lived in El Paso, three major power failures occurred affecting some 700,000 persons in west Texas, New Mexico, and Mexico, including Fort Bliss, Holloman Air Force Base, and White Sands missile range. To my knowledge, no proof of black- outs related to UFO activity has ever been substantiated, but I suppose it could be a possibility. The Disaster Control Guide relies heavily on the re- search and experiences of co-author Charles Bahme in the area of UFOs and their potential. The word \"poten- tial\" to me as a researcher is the key to the whole chapter. Those individuals who believe there is no such thing as a UFO, notwithstanding the overwhelming evi- dence to the contrary, should be informed that there is circumstantial evidence that disastrous effects have al- ready been attributed to UFO activity in the United States and in other countries. When the first edition was published in 1952, Bahme didn't feel there was any significant concern about a UFO threat to our country. However in the 90's he felt the military would not brush off the UFO potential as quickly. He felt it was serious business to those individuals who had experienced unexplained aerial phenomena. Chief Bahme briefly explains several facets of the UFO phenomenon. Chapter 13 of the Guide includes UFO back- ground information, what they might be, the classification system adopted by J. Allen Hyhek, shapes, and the his- tory of UFOs. He also lists several of the well-known UFO Organizations, such as MUFON, NICAP, CAUS, GSW, CUFOS and APRO. In another section he talks about the adverse potential of UFOs, and specifically UFO hazards, force field impact, communications disruption, regional blackouts, and the panic hazard. In the latter section, he refers to the fact that one of the reasons often given by the govern- ment for the tight security on findings is the need to pre- vent the possible panic that the truth might arouse. Lastly, after discussing several hazardous possibilities he describes physiological personal hazards, referring to baking or sterilization of the soil where a UFO has landed. Persons on the ground have sustained serious burns, pa- ralysis, and force field radiated emissions, described like that of a \"stun-gun.\" He mentions that while pursuing UFOs, military aircraft have disappeared in mid-air, ex- ploded, and suffered harassment. The Reference section at the end of Chapter 13 has 15 pages containing information on the UFO potential, including 72 references from the research Bahme has done. Appendix H in the back of the Guide lists 36 book titles on the subject of UFOs. His emergency action and conclusions about UFOs in July 2003 Chapter 13 is brief, but he obviously feels the potential is so real that it should be included in the Fire Officer's Guide to Disaster Control, and I totally agree. Before completing this article I decided to contact the Roswell Fire Department and talk to Chief Salas, who is in charge of training for the local department. He's a vet- eran of 18 years with the Department, and he told me he had never heard of the Fire Officer s Guide to Disaster Control. He did give me some contacts with the National Fire Academy. So, as I stated earlier, \"questions produce more ques- tions.\" I'll be following up on that to determine if the guide is actually used to train fire officers, if it's endorsed by FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency), and several other questions. Visitors pack Von Daniken's mystery theme park in Alps By Fiona Fleck Erich von Daniken, who shot to fame in 1966 with his best-selling book Chariots of the Gods, has made a come- back. This time in his homeland of Switzerland, where he has created a Disneyland-like theme park for fans of UFOs and alien abductions. Built on a modest budget of £40m, Von Daniken's Mystery Park doesn't have expensive special effects or sophisticated interactive computer programs. Neverthe- less, visitors have been flocking to the new theme park set in a disused airfield outside Interlaken in the Swiss Alps ever since it opened last month. \"The great mysteries of the world exist on all five con- tinents, but only a few people have the time and the money to travel to them,\" said Von Daniken, explaining that the idea was to group models of these wonders under one roof for convenience. Mystery Park looks like a spaceship stranded in the Alps. It is divided into seven themed \"pavilions,\" each presenting one of seven \"great mysteries of the world.\" Von Daniken says the aim is \"to ask questions, not to provide answers,\" and that he wants to evoke \"wonder and astonishment\" in visitors. One pavilion, called \"MegaStones,\" describes Stonehenge in Wiltshire as \"a time machine for high priests.\" Professor Rudolf von Steiger of the International Space Science Institute in the Swiss capital of Berne, who visited Mystery Park before it opened on May 24, said, \"It's a theme park, so it's fun. But no one is going to learn anything there.\" MUFON field investigator t-shirt The field investigator t-shirt has the MUFON logo over the left chest pocket and \"MUFON Field In- vestigator\" on the back.

Friedman Debunking Roswell debunkers Shortly after finishing my MUFON 2003 paper \"Cri- tiquing the Roswell Critics\" for the Conference Proceed- ings. I was alerted to two more widely distributed Roswell debunking articles in major publications. Each had the word ROSWELL on the covers in large print, the better to sell the magazines. Often I am told that the Roswell International UFO Mu- seum and Research Center and people like me are only in the Roswell business to make money. We don't count research costs, of course, or the fact that admis- sion to the museum is free. But it is OK for magazines to hype Roswell to sell magazines. The 1997 issue of Time Maga- zine with a goofy looking female on the cover (like no alien any- body had ever reported) and ROSWELL in big type, was their largest selling issue that year until Princess Di died. They were not giving away copies. Popular Mechanics (June 2003) writer Jim Wilson has done other UFO stories, so I would have expected better from him in his article \"Roswell Declassified.\" He makes much of eleven boxes of material (also noted in a very misleading History Channel TV Program) which sup- posedly are all the official files about Roswell, and which had been declassified for the USAF. This is nonsense. These are the boxes of miscellaneous stuff collected by the USAF for its first volume of the Big Roswell (debunking) Report \"Fact vs. Fiction in the New Mexico Desert.\" The Air Force supplied the fiction, as I have noted in detail elsewhere (such as \"The Roswell Incident, USAF and N.Y. Times,\" 1994,27R, $4. UFORI. POB 958, Houlton, ME 04730-0958). Nothing was declassified for the USAF about Roswell! The volume, was a strong effort to pre-empt the GAO Roswell report which came out later. The MOGUL bal- loon explanation was here propounded while ignoring the evidence clearly indicating that was a phoney story. The materials don't match, the dates don't match. Almost all of the relevant testimony about the debris field is ignored. But Wilson bought it hook, line and sinker, even making a big deal about the pristine radar reflector and using a picture of it as included in the article and presented at the Archives. Many people would wrongly think this was what was seen in Gen. Ramey's office!! The second Air Force Volume, \"Case Closed,\" came up with the crash test dummies explanation for the bodies reported in connection with Roswell, even though none were dropped near either the Plains of San Agustin or Foster Ranch.crash sites and none were dropped prior to 1953-or at least 6 years after Roswell. Wilson seems to be impressed by the 11 boxes, even though they have stamped on them \"Roswell Reports Source Files.\" His primary focus, besides these suppos- edly relevant files and the pristine radar reflector (some- how not having the toy-company tape with flower sym- bols that the USAF say explains the I-beams described by Dr. Jesse Marcel Jr. with strange symbols-not flow- ers) is on two other details: A. He says the Base Morning Reports for the 1947 July 4th weekend say nothing about the crash retrieval. So what? Maj. Jesse Marcel and CIC officer Sheridan W. Cavitt didn't return to the base until late on Monday, July 7. There is no indication the morning reports were highly classified or even would have contained highly clas- sified information. They seem to deal with changes in personnel assignments.   . B. Wilson claims that Frank Kaufrnann, whose nefari- ous activities I discussed in a recent column, \"had.been tied to the story from the very beginning.\" The fact is that his name shows up nowhere until 1991! My first discus- sion with Jesse Marcel was in 1978, the first book, \"The Roswell Incident,\" was published in 1980. Bill Moore and I did six MUFON papers about Roswell by 1986.1 instigated the heavily watched Unsolved Mys- teries Roswell Program in 1989. It brought forth a num- ber of new witnesses. But still no Kaufrnann. Kaufmann added nothing but confusion and disinformation to the story. Karl T. Pflock had debunked him over a decade ago, and there are negative mentions of him in several places, in- cluding in the 2nd edition of Don Berliner's and my Crash at Corona in 1997. In other words, the fact that Kaufrnann's testimony has been shown to be spurious tells us nothing whatso- ever about the legitimacy of the Roswell story. Wilson makes it sound as though this puts the nail in the Roswell coffin! \"A Roswell Requiem\" in SKEPTIC (Vol. 10, No. 1, 2003) magazine is much worse than Wilson's article, start- ing with a cover that is a splendid example of the practice of debunkery (Dr. David Jacobs' turn of phrase). There is a quite large disc-shaped shiny craft.tilted at an angle and stuck in the ground with a flock of sheep in front and a bunch of military vehicles in the background. There is a sub-title, \"How a modest military adventure in 1947 was turned into a great whopper of a UFO tale in 1978.\" A far more accurate sub-title would have been \"How a Major UFO event of 1947 was turned into a whopper of a tale in 2003.\" Page 18 MUFON UFO Journal July 2003"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"The tale teller is B.D. \"Duke\" Gildenberg, a military meteorologist heavily involved in balloon research projects for 30 years. He seems to have done almost no real home- work with regard to Roswell, and picked up on every false claim. I especially resent his referring to my docu- mentary movie \"UFOs ARE Real\" as a tabloid! It in- cludes 4 PhDs, 2 Lt. Colonels, a nuclear physicist, an astronaut, etc. He totally ignores the original testimony from Maj. Marcel; his son; the rancher's son and neighbors; Walter Haut, the base PIO who issued the press release; retired Gen. T.J. DuBose (Chief of Staff for Gen. Roger Ramey, head of the 8th Air Force in Fort Worth, TX, and Col. Blanchard's boss); the sheriff's family; and many others. He seems not to understand that the debris field cov- ered a huge area and consisted of small pieces, not a huge intact saucer. The latter would have been appropri- ate for the Plains of San Augustin Crash retrieval event, but there were no sheep out there, and that crash isn't even mentioned in the article. Duke seems very angry that his claim and that of Dr. C. B. Moore that it was just a Mogul balloon, given when Don Berliner and I met the two of them in NM, wasn't blindly accepted, even though it was clear they knew noth- ing about the crash, other than what was printed in the Roswell Daily Record July 9, totally ignoring the stories in newspapers from Chicago west of the previous day. He mentions the first book, The Roswell Incident, but gives a publication date of 1988 rather than 1980, so he can tabloidize the story by having the story in the Na- tional Enquirer long before that. He talks about a bal- loon launched on July 7,1947, that just might have been responsible for the story, even though Marcel and Cavitt went out to the Brazel ranch on July 6. He fails to mention that The Roswell Incident shows a drawing of that very balloon package, and includes a comment by Dr. Moore that he knew of no balloon being investigated at that time that could cover such a large area. Duke buys into CIC Officer Sheridan Cavitt's totally false and very belated claim that he never met rancher Brazel, and that the balloon only covered an area 20' square and would easily fit in one vehicle. Even the cover-up story in the July 9 Roswell Daily Record says the wreckage covered an area 200 yards in diameter. If there had only been that small item, Brazel would have brought it into town with him and there would certainly have been no need for Marcel and Cavitt to have followed the rancher out in a long and tedious drive, some of it cross country, and to spend overnight. They could not have found the ranch without following Brazel out, so Cavitt had to have met Brazel. Neither Duke nor Wilson deals with the peculiar prop- erties of the real wreckage, such as memory foil that could be bent on itself many times, could not be torn, and would unfold on its own. The I-beams, which were as light as balsa wood and could not be cut, broken or burned, cer- tainly aren't what the radar reflector frames were made out of. Neither mentions that Marcel stressed that there was nothing conventional to be found, and that the debris field covered an area many hundreds of yards long and a few hundred feet wide. . Neither notes that the original articles across the coun- try on July 8 all said the wreckage was found last week rather than the Air Force's new story for Brazel on July 9 claiming June 14 was the date. Duke includes all kinds of misinformation and totally irrelevant information about unrelated events that hap- pened much later. He shows the crash test dummies with- out mentioning that, according to Col. Madsen, who ran the program, they were 6' tall and weighed 175 pounds. He doesn't explain the morphing down to little guys. Lapses of the mind and memory supposedly accounted for people confusing the date of 1947 with 1953 and later!! There is a great deal of misrepresentation. I can't re- ally explain Duke's purpose in presenting so much non- sense. He didn't talk to anybody directly connected to the event. He didn't read the relevant literature; he couldn't get most of his facts straight. He probably is receiving a government pension, as was Cavitt and several of the others who have spoken out negatively about Roswell (don't forget that supposedly only pro-UFO people have a financial stake in Roswell). Having met Dr. Michael Shermer, publisher and edi- tor-in-chief of SKEPTIC, and heard some of the silly things he has said on TV about UFOs, I am certainly not sur- prised at his publishing this piece of fantasy. Michael, af- ter all, is the one who said (on the History Channel, no less) that he will believe in UFOs when someone gives him an alien body to examine!! I suspect he accepts the fact that there are lots of nuclear weapons around, even if nobody can provide him one. If he doesn't think the government would lie about very highly classified events in New Mex ico in July, 1947, (Remember none of the Mogul Balloon technology was classified, only its purpose), I suggest he read the news- papers after the first nuclear explosion at Trinity site on White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico on July 16, 1945. A news story was required because many people saw it even from 100 miles away, and there were many calls to authorities, even though it was quite early in the morn- ing. The press story said that a large ammunition dump had blown up, but fortunately nobody was injured. This was indeed a whopper; just as was the tale that a radar reflector weather balloon combination was found on the Brazel ranch, perhaps accompanied by large crash test dummies not dropped until years later in other locations according to the USAF's map of the drop sites. A good example of Duke's anti-Roswell zeal is this statement: \"After 55 years of commercial exploitation, the mythology has reached frenzied heights.\" Later, on the same page, he states, \"..for more than 30 years no one anywhere cared about the incident at Roswell.\" No- body cared, but there was commercial exploitation during those 30 years??? As Shakespeare said: \"Methinks he doth protest top much.\" He isn't skeptically doing research, he is preaching propaganda.

The problem the report examines is the pattern of tac- tics of flying saucers and the effort to develop conclu- sions as to the possibility of existence. Under possible origins of the unusual flying objects, the report states: \"It is evident from the performance characteristics attrib- uted to the unidentified objects at this time that if they are foreign, they involve efficiencies of performance which have not been realized in any operational airborne device in this country. It would, therefore, be a mistake to ana- lyze the technical aspects of the situation within the limits of our own knowledge of practical developments.\" Although a very interesting early classified report, the authors confined their discussion to lights in the sky and radar-visual cases, many with highly credible witnesses. See: http://209.132.68.98/pdf/airintelrptlOO-203-79.pdf AJVIC document (I) A September 1947 Air Materiel Command (AMC) document, Opinion Concerning Flying Discs, that was prepared directly in response to the UFO wave of June and July, 1947: Found at the National Archives, Mary- land, in Record Group 341, this three-page opinion makes an unequivocal statement for the reality of Flying Discs and UFOs. \"The phenomenon reported is something real and not visionary or fictitious.\" Note that this is a Secret memo and deals with the sighting data alone and makes no direct reference to other data, such as crashes. However, the opinion does clearly refer to \"the lack of physical evidence in the shape of crash recovered exhibits which would undeniably prove the existence of the objects.\" Is this in conflict with the other memos that support crash retrievals? No; not at all. This is a Secret perfunc- tory memo and could be an effective cover story if leaked to Soviet Intelligence. Although the memo was signed by Twining, it was coordinated with many others at AMC, including Col. Moore, Chief of the Aircraft Laboratory; DA Dicky, Chief of the Propeller Laboratory; Gen. DL Putt, Engineering Division; Col. Minty, Chief Power Plant Laboratory; and Gen. Bevtual of T-3. The net result of this memo is that the government has confirmed the validity of the UFO phenomenon and later goes on to establish programs Sign, Grudge, and Bluebook at Secret level while at the same time developing a Top Secret Majestic program to deal with the super sensitive aspects of dead ET bodies and crash wreckage analysis.

The report is a preliminary design document that in- cludes sectional drawings, performance characteristics, weight breakdowns, control systems, and problem areas. This 1955 report gels with another story relating to U.S. Air Force interest in testing saucer designs. According to a retired AF Lt. Col., in 1954, while a 2nd Lt., he and several other 2nd Lt.'s came across a table full of \"wind tunnel test model saucers\" while in a wind tunnel test building of Area \"C,\" Wright-Patterson AFB. That the recovered UFOs studied by Majestic 12 would later become the subject of back-engineering pro- grams (which Silver Bug may have been linked to) is logi- cal.

Having studied chemistry at the University of Budapest in 1921, he later received a diploma in 1925 in chemical engineering and a doctoral degree in mathematics in 1928. With political unrest looming in Europe, in 1930 Von Neumann visited Princeton University; and when the In- stitute for Advanced Studies was founded there in 1933, he was appointed to be one of the original six professors of mathematics. Throughout the Second World War, Von Neumann served on several national committees, and brought to- gether the needs of the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Manhattan Project and was a recognized author- Page 20 MUFON UFO Journal July 2003"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"ity in hydrodynamics, ballistics, meteorology, game theory, statistics, and was a major contributor in the field of com- puting. In the 1950s, Von Neumann was employed as a consultant to IBM to review proposed and ongoing ad- vanced technology projects.  , Of relevance to www.majesticdocuments.com is the fact that in November 1983, Dr. Robert Irving Sarbacher of the Washington Institute of Technology (who had also worked with the Research and Development Board) confirmed to researcher William Steinman that Von Neumann had worked with Vannevar Bush and Robert Oppenheimer on a project involving crashed UFOs and alien bodies. See: http://www.majesticdocuments.com/ personnel/vonneumann.html Lloyd Berkner (L) Official Records on Lloyd Berkner: Dr. Lloyd V. Berkner was an alleged member of MJ-12 and was ex- ecutive secretary of the Joint Research and Development Board under Dr. Vannevar Bush. He also chaired the committee whose study led to the establishment of the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group.  , Berkner subsequently served on the \"Robertson Panel,\" a civilian scientific advisory panel requested by the Eisenhower White House, chaired by Cal Tech math- ematician Dr. H. P. Robertson and convened and funded by the CIA. In 1950 and later, he was a member of a UFO group that was also funded by the CIA.

(Continued from Page 24) and an isotopic analysis might verify the earthly origin of the rocks or lack of it. We expect that good laboratory analysis work will show whether or not the evidence was hoaxed, and if hoaxed, how it was done. That would close the case forever and provide the tools that could be used to analyze the data in future similar cases. However, if the results prove to be unique and mysterious, then perhaps we will see new dis- coveries come out of all of this. Either way, we believe science will prevail. Since this is not a MUFON investigation, we can only report on what we hear about the results. Enough has already been said about the claims. There is little doubt that A.J. Gevaerd will continue to pursue Oliveira on be- half of his Brazilian UFO Magazine and Linda Moulton Howe on behalf of her Earthfiles web site. Journal expiration dates wrong The top line of the MUFON UFO Journal mailing label is intended to show the date of the last issue to be mailed as subscriptions expire. For example, 2003/08 means that the August 2003 journal is the last issue un- less renewed. The Journal mailing service was trying to streamline the process for mailing the June issue, and they modified the database. Unfortunately, for some reason the modifi- cation changed all Journal expiration dates listed on the mailing labels, and caused a large number of yellow col- ored expiration notices to go out. The good news is that the MUFON Headquarters da- tabase is still intact and will be used to correct the prob- lem for the mailing of the July issue. Please accept our sincere apology for any concerns this may have caused. National UFO Awareness Week MUFON will observe National UFO Awareness Week from Aug. 16, through Aug. 23,2003. We hope to build on the successes of the 2002 event and expand the num- ber of activities held this year. State and local groups and individuals are urged to mount an aggressive public awareness campaign by placing dis- plays in local shopping centers and libraries, providing materials for radio and television stations and newspa- pers, speaking before public and private groups and soci- eties, and a whole variety of new activities., A reminder State and local MUFON organizations which have ad- dress changes, email changes, or web site changes need to immediately contact MUFON Headquarters so that this information is included in our files and on our website.

Mars, now retrograding in Aquarius, reaches a point opposite the Sun on Aug. 28 and is also nearest Earth the day before (night of the 26th-27th). At that time the brilliant red planet rises in the ESE around sunset and then remains visible in the southern sky all night long. Although Mars oppositions occur about every 14 months, the small planet offers its finest tele- scopic appearances every 15 to 17 years when it comes nearest the Sun, as during this year's close approach. But it is an unprecedented event this time, coming the closest to Earth in recorded history, and in fact its near- est in at least 60,000 years! Mars, for a time the bright- est object in the heavens except for the Moon, reaches a dazzling magnitude of-2.9, an apparent diameter of 25.1 arc-seconds, and a separation from Earth of only 34,646,418 miles! The event offers amateur astronomers with small to medium telescopes their best opportunity for the next 15 years to discern the usually hard-to-see surface detail on the red planet. The white south polar cap should be easy to see. Dark patches and streaks, now known to be vast boulder and rock fields across the otherwise ochre-tinted deserts, can be glimpsed at moments of steady atmo- spheric seeing. Yellow, orange, or red filters can enhance the contrast of surface features. Jupiter (magnitude -1.7) is accessible only to south- ern observers early in the month low in the WNW after sunset. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars is best observed when it is highest in the sky (around 1 AM) and atmospheric interference is minimal. Southern observers have the finest views of all, with the red planet reaching an elevation of about 75° due S. Mars sets in the W around sunrise in late August. Saturn (0.2), in Gemini, rises in the ME soon after 2 AM in mid-August and lies low in the E at dawn. The ringed world is near the Moon on the 23rd. The Stars: Since the constellation Lyra the Harp is directly over- head now, this is a good time to point out a couple of telescopic sights within its borders. One-and a half degrees NE of brilliant Vega is the fa- mous \"double-double,\" Epsilon Lyrae. To the unaided eye, the 4th-magnitude star appears single. Binoculars, how- ever, reveal two stars, and in a small telescope each of the components is itself double, making a total of four stars. Lyra contains another famous object, the Ring Nebula, located between Beta and Gamma Lyrae (somewhat closer to Beta), the southern two stars in the harp's crooked rectangle shape. Look first for a \"smudgy star\" in a telescope, then use higher powers to resolve the smudge into a \"smoke ring\" or \"doughnut.\" The nebula represents a spherical shell of gas cast off by a faint dying star in the center. Meteor Shower: Unfortunately, this year the bright full moon severely hampers the viewing of the Perseid meteor shower at its peak on the morning of Aug. 13. Thus the normal maxi- mum rate of up to 100 meteors per hour will not be seen. The shower can be observed in the days before and after the peak, but in greatly reduced numbers.

July 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page 23"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"By John F. Schuessler MUFON International Director No MUFON Endorsement An alleged UFO abduction case took place in Corguinho, Brazil on Sept. 15, 2002, at 7:30 p.m. The person making the claim is Paulistan Urandir Fernandes de Oliveira. Part of his claim involved alleged physical evidence left behind during the abduction event. During the past three months this case has been ban- tered about on the Internet, and much heated language has been exchanged between the Internet participants. Some of these people even claim that MUFON has en- dorsed the case as being valid. This could not be further from the truth. MUFON doesn't endorse or reject a case based on claims and/or Internet rhetoric. Instead, we want to see the results of a thorough investiga- tion, hopefully by multiple inves- tigators, and laboratory analy- sis results for any physical evi- dence involved in the case. Unfortunately. MUFON has not received an investigative report of this case. So we are left to read the Internet musings like everyone else. This case was first brought to MUFON's attention by Linda Moulton Howe in March 2003. She is not a MUFON member and was not making a report to MUFON. In- stead, she was inquiring about where MUFON stood on the case. The answer was that we couldn't take a stand because we had no investigator's report of the incident. We knew nothing about it. Howe went on to say she had spent considerable time in Brazil investigating the alleged abduction. Her quest was to get the physical evidence into a laboratory and see what an analysis could reveal. That appears to be a good goal. She said we could find the results of her on-going investigation on her website at www.earthtlles.com. It appears that she is the only investigator to do an on-site investigation of Oliveira's September 2002 abduction claim. Since that time we have heard from A. J. Gevaerd, Brazilian UFO Magazine editor and MUFON Represen- tative for Brazil, and found that he has been after Urandir Oliveira for a number of years, believing him to be a hoaxer or worse. Because of this he didn't need to do an on-site investigation of the September 2002 abduction claim. He has strong feelings about the background of the witness and worries that Howe's investigation might tend to give credibility where it should not be given. People on the Internet are busily taking sides and add- Jo/in Schuessler ing fiery rhetoric to the discussion, but none of them has done an actual on-site investigation. Many seem to have lost their objectivity and have stooped to name calling and character assassination. They want MUFON to do the same, but it is not going to happen. This, as in any other case, is not about taking sides. It is about the conduct of good investigations, the gathering of all types of documentation, the freedom to question all inputs from all individuals, having the physical evidence analyzed in multiple laboratories, and then openly pre- senting the results of the investigation for public inspec- tion. While UFO incidents with physical evidence present are not common, they offer the most promise of new discoveries. To be really exciting, these cases should exhibit the characteristics of high strangeness and high credibility. The Oliveira case certainly possesses char- acteristics of high strangeness. On the other hand, the characteristic of high credibility has been called into ques- tion by Gevaerd. Once credibility has been questioned, we are left with two approaches. One is to ignore it and hope it goes away, and the other is to redouble the efforts in the inves- tigation to find a solution. Ignoring a case seldom works. It usually results in the case taking on a life of its own and never dying. That leaves us with intensifying the investigation-find- ing additional witnesses, conducting independent investi- gations, comparing investigators' notes, utilizing multiple laboratories for the analysis of all physical evidence, and analyzing the communications between all parties involved in the case. Because all of this is costly in time and dollars, the chances of success are not real high. And in the Oliveira case, high emotions and Internet ranting seems to be add- ing an additional fog factor to the results. Oliveira's claim that he was abducted from his bed after taking a shower, and then taken out through the ceiling of the room is not unlike the claims of other abductees. The main difference is with the remaining physical evidence. It is almost totally unlike any other abduction case. The pillow and bed sheet were left with the shape of his body emblazoned in the cotton and polyester material. A similar pattern was left on the surface of the ceiling. A textile analysis could provide a lot of insight into the resulting conditions of the bed sheet and pillow. Using the techniques of an arson investigator could do the same for the materials found in the ceiling pattern. An additional unique aspect of this case is the claim by people living nearby that strange stones fell from the sky at the same time. Any respected geology laboratory would be able to identify every element in the stones, compare them with other stones from Brazil or elsewhere, (Continued on Paee 21) Page 24 MUFON UFO Journal July 2003"}]
