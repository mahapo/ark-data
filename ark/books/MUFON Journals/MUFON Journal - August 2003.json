J. Gevaerd concerning the alleged abduction of Urandir Oliveira in Corguinho, Brazil, was summarized. Then in the July Journal, MUFON Di- rector John Schuessler made it clear that MUFON was not taking a position in sup- port of the case, even though Ms. Howe was invited to speak about the case at the MUFON 2003 Symposium. Since then, I have received additional information from Gevaerd, and we have the 40-page report prepared by Mrs. Phyllis Budinger, as well as additional in- formation regarding studies of the physi- cal evidence. Information provided by Ms. Howe is, of course, available on Earthfiles.com. Additional research on the photos by the Seattle MUFON group has also been made available. I have talked with Mr. Gevaerd by phone and via email, and talked with Ms. Howe at the Symposium. hi this article I will look at the evidence presented, emphasizing those things which are normally considered in estab- lishing the validity of a case of this type, such as the character and reputation of the alleged abductee, the alleged wit- nesses, the amount and quality of physi- cal evidence, and the procedures followed by the investigators. Throughout the report, I will use the name Urandir to designate the alleged abductee, as is the custom in Brazil. The alleged abduction In November of last year, Felipe Branco, an associate of Urandir (and an alleged abductee himself), sent details of the alleged abduction of Urandir out over the Internet. Ms. Howe says, \"What made this email unusual were the photographs at- tached. One showed 18 small disc-shaped stones that Felipe Branco picked up from the ground, along with Urandir's family, friends, and visitors who heard and saw dozens of the rocks fall out of the sky for several seconds around 7:30 p.m. on Sept. 15,2002. \"Urandir Oliveira thinks the stones fell at the same time he was lifted from his bed through the ceiling and roof into an extraterrestrial craft operated by the tall, . Or smoke and mirrors? The primary investigators A.J. Gevaerd A.J. Gevaerd A. J. Gevaerd is MUFON's National Director for Brazil and founder-editor of the Brazilian UFO Magazine, which has been in existence for 19 years. He is also the founder and director of the Bra- zilian Center for Flying Saucer Research (CBPDV), the largest such organization in South America with more than 3,300 mem- bers. He has investi- gated numerous cases throughout Brazil, and is the author of UFO Contact at Maringua. In 1983 Gevaerd was selected by Dr. J. Allen Hynek as representative of the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) in Bra- ziL He is one of the international direc- tors of the Annual International UFO Congress in Laughlin, NV, and has spo- ken in 29 countries around the world, as well as extensively in Brazil. Gevaerd, 41, has a B.A. in chemistry, but decided in 1986 to quit teaching and devote his full time to UFO research. L.M.Howe Linda Moulton Howe Ms. Howe is a graduate of Stanford University with a masters in communi- cations, and has received many awards for her work in film, TV, and radio. One of her best-known films was \"A Strange Har- vest,\" which explored the world of animal muti- lations. She is the author of An Alien Harvest, which continues her work with animal mutilations; Glimpses of Other Reali- ties, volumes I and II, which concerns U.S. military, intelligence, and civilian testimonies about non-humans interact- ing with earth life; and Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles, which fea- tures eyewitness accounts and scien- tific research of biophysical and bio- chemical changes in affected cereal crops by complex energy systems. She appears on Coast to Coast with Whitley Strieber, and has an internet news magazine called Earthfiles.com. She has spoken at many conferences throughout the world. blond beings.\" According to Ms. Howe, after the rock fall, his family and friends rushed to Urandir's house and found him gone. However, in the bedroom everyone was reportedly shocked to find imprints of a human body \"melted\" onto the bed sheet and scorched into the wood ceil- ing. Ms. Howe says she is surprised that she is the only individual out of several receiving the email who decided to inves- tigate. She contacted Felipe Branco, who paid her way to Corguinho to look at the case. The investigation In order to become more familiar with the area and the situation, Ms. Howe phoned A. J. Gevaerd, MUFON director for Brazil, publisher of Brazilian UFO Magazine, and a veteran ufologist who she already knew. Gevaerd was, in fact, quite familiar with Urandir and his Project Portal operation, having investigated various claims by Urandir and his associates over a period of several years, and having concluded that all were hoaxes. He explained this to Ms. Howe, who told me that she concluded that Gevaerd was being too emotional about Urandir. Ms. Howe visited the home of Urandir, observed and photographed a burned bedsheet and ceiling, and videotaped an interview (English-Portuguese transla- tion by Luciano Didier). The alleged abductee reported that he had been told in advance mat he would be abducted, had taken a shower, and was on his bed, clothed only in his underwear shorts. He reported that he was reading a book, with his right arm extended beyond the bed. His feet were also reportedly extended off the bed. Urandir said that a bright violet light dominated the room, forming a light tube which reportedly lifted him through the ceiling and into a spaceship, causing him to feel heat. He said he did not lose consciousness. The burned outline on the sheet, as well as the less definite outline on the August 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"ceiling (no right hand and no feet imprints on either the sheet or the ceiling), roughly matches that of a human body, although there is some question as to whether it matches Urandir's body. In evaluating why mere were no im- ages of the right hand and the feet on the ceiling, Ms. Howe says, \"The specula- tion is that the violet beam technology did not have to separate his feet and right hand from the bed sheet. So, the energy was different in those places when Urandir's body went through the ceiling without leaving feet or hand prints in the wood.\" She questioned why the burning of the sheet and ceiling was necessary, however, since abductees have reportedly been moved from beds and through walls and ceilings with no burning of bed cloth- ing or structures. In fact, as she noted, this is apparently the only case in history where such effects have been reported as part of an alleged abduction. Urandir offered this explanation through the translator: \"Because this was the only programmed abduction that he was conscious about, and he knew it was going to happen. There was no need to leave those marks actually, but they wanted to leave him with enough credits to the public and to the science commu- nity that these evidences are very clear... .they wanted to have some proofs because they want to have the evidences to prepare the population for the arrival (of the beings).\" Ms. Howe asked Urandir to lie on the bed in the position he was in when he was abducted. He did so, sticking his feet from the bed and holding the book as if reading, but she noted that in this position the pillow would not have been burned. So Urandir repositioned himself, dropping his head onto the pillow, mak- ing the holding of the book outside the bed somewhat awkward. Ms. Howe also noted that the body pattern on the ceiling was farther east and to the right of the body print on the bed. She says, \"One speculation is that Urandir's body was moving forward to- ward the head of the bed as it was lifted upward by the violet beam technology.\" Another researcher has suggested that the bed had been moved prior to the ar- rival of Ms. Howe (more on this later). Ms. Howe also wondered where the body marks were from the reported re- turn trip from the spaceship to the bed three days later on Sept 18. Urandir said that the paralysis of his body in the re- clining position, both leaving and return- ing, was calculated precisely by the non- human blondes to be exactly the same. Burned shape of body on Urandir s ceiling. \"So no second set of marks,\" concludes Ms. Howe. She collected samples from the sheet, pillow case, and ceiling, and obtained a number of the stones which allegedly fell during the alleged abduction. She was unable to view or take samples of the undershorts Urandir was wearing during the reported abduction, since they had reportedly been tossed into the wash. Ms. Howe speculated to me that per- haps there were no burns on the under- shorts because they were made of cot- ton. No mention has been made of retriev- ing and analyzing the so-called \"akashic records plates\" of rough stone with scribbles on them (in the \"extraterrestrial language\") which Urandir supposedly re- trieves from a special cave, shows to visi- tors (for a price), and gives to special fol- lowers. The \"abductee\" Contacts with American and Brazilian investigators, both inside and outside of Brazil, reveal that Urandir was no stranger to them prior to this latest alleged encoun- ter with ETs. One well-known American investiga- tor, who asked that his/her name not be used in this article (\"I don't want to lose friends\"), said he/she had contacted \"a few people\" in Brazil in May about Urandir, and \"none had anything good to say about him, and at least two do not like Gevaerd either.\" However, all agreed with Gevaerd's view of the case. Later, he/she \"queried about eight other Brazilians who speak English, and all condemned Urandir as well. However, several quoted Gevaerd's UFO magazine as their main source of information about him.\" Gevaerd lives about 30 miles from Urandir's Project Portal complex, and is the ufologist who has done the most in- vestigation of Urandir's activities over the past several years as claims of crashed UFOs and other events have been publi- cized by Urandir. However, another ufologist, Claudeir Covo, an electrical engineer, co-editor of Revista UFO, and president of the Na- tional Institute of Investigation of Aero- space Phenomena (INFA), says that he has also investigated Urandir's claims. \"I started to record in video all the pre- sentations of Urandir, which started in 1997. Urandir used to bend coins and forks, said that he could cure AIDS and cancer, that he could resuscitate dead people, and could perform other phenom- ena. \"All these things were designed only to impress the viewer. By analysing Urandir's videos that I recorded in slow motion I noticed clearly that he used simple techniques of magic, manipulat- ing several small objects out of sight from people. \"Thus together with other UFO re- searchers, I started to investigate his ac- tivities,\" explains Claudeir. \"He used bat- teries of 12 volts and headlamps of cars at the distance of 200 meters from his visi- tors at night that could simulate UFOs.

Then Urandir started using advertisement balloons of three meters in diameter with a lamp inside to fool people.\" Fourteen members of Grupo de Estudos Ufologicos da Baixada Santista (GEUBS-UFO Study Group of Baixada Santista) emailed a statement to the MUFON UFO Journal which said: \"We hereby reject the groundless popularization of the false close encoun- ter of Mr. Urandir Fernandes de Oliveira. It is a notorious and well known fact throughout the Brazilian community of UFO researchers that this person does not have, nor has ever had, any kind of psychic powers whatsoever, and has never been involved in the abduction phenomenon. Whatever goes on in his estate, known as Projecto Portal, has been proven false and phony, nothing more than a huge setup aiming at profit at the cost of people's good faith.\" Rodrigo Branco, radio DJ and GEUBS coordinator, adds, \"The main means of communication in Brazil, either televised or printed media, have already shown all the farse of Mr. U.F.O. claims through a series of constant denunciation by the The photo of the burned sheet taken by Ms. Howe when she visited in February.

The land sales were reportedly to people who were told that they would be safe on this land, protected by extrater- restrials, when a natural disaster came in a year or two. Urandir's Project Portal operations have been compared to the \"Heaven's August 2003 MUFON UFO Journal PageS"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Gate\" group and to the Jim Jones suicide cult. The Seattle UFO/Paranormal Group has, in fact, produced a side-by-side com- parison between Jim Jones' Jonestown group and Urandir's Project Portal. According to Gevaerd, when someone complains about something or discovers they have been misled, he or she is threat- ened by Urandir or his followers. \"One of the most serious cases,\" says Gevaerd, \"happened to a manager from Sao Paulo who discovered in warehouses of the farm of Urandir, in Corguinho, mo- torcycles prepared to transit in rural ar- eas and paraphernalia composed of ra- dios, communications type walkie talkie batteries, mile lights, and varied instru- ments she did not know. \"When seeing that such equipment could only be used to produce the insis- tent lights in the hills of the area that ev- erybody thinks are flying disks, she asked what the equipment was for. Urandir re- portedly told the lady, 'If you open your mouth you will be sorry.' She says she received more than ten threatening calls from him or his followers after returning to Sao Paulo.\" In Ms. Howe's reports, Urandir is re- ferred to as a \"farmer.\" However, Gevaerd states that Urandir is simply a promoter for Projecto Portal, but in the past has been a bricklayer, a gold washer/prospec- tor, and an amateur magician. In an interview with the publication ZeroHora, while in jail, Urandir was asked what he does for a living. He replied, \"I have been working by myself these past four years, giving lectures. I used to work in the building industry, and I also have a publishing company.\" He said his lectures are about \"mental evolution, apprenticeship in the manipu- lation of energy, and self control. I charge $R 50 (about $ 14.00 U.S).\" According to Urandir, those coming to Project Portal pay \"for tickets and food,\" about $11.00 per day for visitors and about $4.50 per day for \"associates.\" He said that Project Portal is \"a place where people have parapsychological experiences, ecological and ufological. There are 490 hectares (of land), and my intent is to buy 1.5 thousand to form a community where I will raise cattle and fish. Associates will pay R$ 1,4 thou- sand (about $390 U.S.) for this... .There's nothing as yet; we are gathering money....We sold about 6,000 shares of the 490 hectares. Each person bought as much as they wanted.\" When asked if he owned the land he was selling, Urandir said, \"The land is in the name of Zeferino Bingolin, a local resi- dent of Campo Grande. I have a buy and sell contract, and I only have to pay the last mortgage to own the land.\" Asked if he had had any pre- vious problems with the law, Urandir said, \"No. Once I was arrested because of a domestic fight with my ex-wife with another woman, but there was nothing.\" In an interview by Ms. Howe and Whitley Strieber publicized by Ms. Howe on Earthfiles.com, Urandir claimed to have been shot by individuals lying in am- bush. Ms. Howe noted that she has seen the \"round (dark) scar on his left arm slightly below his elbow.\" This claim by Urandir was investigated by Gevaerd, who says, \"Urandir hurt him- self with a piece of wood from a wired fence in front of three people, one of them a former co-worker from Belo Horizone, Fabiana Matias. \"About a month after that, while talk- ing to a small group, Urandir said that he was shot and showed the scar, again in front of Fabiana, who immediately inter- rupted and said it wasn't true. Then Urandir said it was, and that he was shot. This is the origin of this lie.\" Ms. Howe also quoted Felipe Branco as claiming that \"A.J. has been there (Urandir's compound) only once, almost seven years ago.\" Replies Gevaerd, \"Perhaps he should consult the local Campo Grande press, or even his boss, Mr. Urandir. I was at his pal's property the last time in December, 2001, when he claimed that a UFO crashed at that man's farm, which also proved to be another fake from the same scam go- ing on. Urandir will certainly remember, as I noticed their contradictions to the press and interrupted.\" The \"evidence\" The evidence in this case consists of the burned bed sheet, samples taken from the burned ceiling, and a number of stones which supposedly rained down on Urandir's supporters during his al- leged abduction. Before looking at analyses of the bed sheet by various individuals, there is the question of whether the bed sheet viewed, photographed, and sampled by Ms. Howe is the original bed sheet pro- moted by Felipe Branco hi his effort to get someone to investigate the alleged abduction. The Seattle UFO/Paranormal Group, which cancelled a scheduled appearance by Ms. Howe because of then- concerns with her support of this case, states that the photo of the bed sheet put on the Some of the stones from Brazil. Internet by Felipe Branco (i.e. the origi- nal photo) does not match the bed sheet photographed and investigated by Ms. Howe, even though Urandir and his as- sociates stated that the room had been sealed immediately after the alleged ab- duction hi September of 2002. It is contended that the burns in the leg areas \"are dramatically different,\" the pillow is different (with what appears to be an additional pillow of some sort in the original photo), and the position of the bed is different (see photos on page 5), even though the lighting is similar. The photo analysis was done by Charlette LeFevre, B.A. in Research at Wright State University and three-year member of the Ohio Academy of Science. She also measured the torso of Urandir sitting on the bed, and compared it to the torso length of the burned area, and found \"a difference of almost half, even taking into account photo perspective distortion and foreshortening.\" Thus there is some doubt as to the legitimacy of the bed sheet and pillow \"evidence,\" especially in view of the repu- tation of Urandir and his associates for producing fake UFO evidence. The initial report by Ms. Howe of the investigation of the burned sheet in- volved an examination by W. C. Levengood, a biophysicist who is known for his work with crop circles. He indicated that the cotton threads interwoven with the polyester threads showed no signs of scorching, while the polyester had melted, despite the fact that polyester has a melting point of 500 de- grees F and cotton has a scorch tempera- ture of 300 degrees. He said he had \"no idea\" how the anomaly had occurred. Also investigating the bed sheet for Ms. Howe and Levengood was Phyllis Budinger, an analytical chemist and owner of Frontier Analysis, Ltd., who has investigated such anomalies as Betty Hill's dress and material from the Delphos, KS, encounter. Page 6 MUFON UFO Journal August 2003"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The Project Portal compound on the \"farm \" of Vrandir. A Project Portal building. She concluded that a fast burst of heat could melt the polyester without scorch- ing the cotton due to polyester's faster conduction of heat. Experimenting with a common house- hold iron with a temperature of about 500 degrees F, Mrs. Budinger was able to melt the polyester without scorching the cot- ton. However, Ms. Howe pointed out on her web site that the polyester on the sheet provided by Urandir was melted the same on both sides, while Mrs. Budinger's experiment on a sample did not look the same on both sides. She also noted that Mrs. Budinger's experiment had flattened the polyester, due to the weight of the iron, and that the sheet obtained in Brazil did not have that characteristic. Ms. Howe also disputed whether the polyester would conduct heat ten times faster than cotton, citing Prof. Herbert Barndt, director of the Grundy Testing Laboratory, School of Textiles and Mate- rials, Philadelphia University. Mrs. Budinger responds that the iron experiment was to test whether the poly- ester could melt without the cotton being scorched, not to try to exactly duplicate the burns on the sheet being tested. She adds, \"Clearly a value of 0.280 for PET (polyester) and 0.029 for cotton shows that the PET transmits heat faster. My sources for these values are refer- enced in my report. Furthermore, the poly- mer chemists I consulted concur with me. \"On this case I consulted with five pro- fessional polymer chemists, four of whom are Ph.D.s. The total experience repre- sented by these people is roughly 175 years. If you add my own professional experience, this comes to roughly 210 years,\" Mrs. Budinger noted. Mrs. Budinger also points out that Prof. Bamdt had originally said that the fiber strands were a mixture of polyester and cotton, while she had correctly re- ported that the polyester was cross-wo- ven with the cotton. Ms. Howe later ac- knowledged that Mrs. Budinger was cor- rect. Ms. Howe describes a section of the mattress cover which appears to have a missing vertical thread, and three hori- zontal polyester melts where the thread should have been, with none of the other polyester fibers affected, suggesting that this indicates a pinpoint heat source. Mrs. Budinger says that particular sample was not sent to her, but that she found no evidence of pinpoint melting in any of the samples she did examine. \"I suspect the missing thread went missing after the heat exposure, perhaps during the sampling procedure.\" She concludes that her analyses of the material, along with her evaluation of the recent Earthfiles reports, show \"no real evidence of an alien abduction.\" Professor Barndt, who reportedly has been working in textile research for 35 years, tested a sample of the sheet with a small blowtorch at 1500 degrees F for two to four seconds. It produced some melting, but Ms. Howe said, \"The shape of your melted polyester; it's not quite identical to the Brazil.\" Prof. Barndt agreed that the burns were probably not caused by a torch simi- lar to his. He had previously dampened the sheet because Urandir had reportedly taken a shower before lying on the bed (and not dried off?). Ms. Howe also speculates that Urandir was sweating, due to the high temperatures in Brazil in September. When asked how he would duplicate the burned sample, Prof. Barndt said, \"I don't know exactly what I would do, but I can tell you we'd probably need a lot of bedspreads before we got it right. It wouldn't happen the first time, at least not what I see happening here. It's very unusual. And why didn't it just ignite and burn up? Probably because of the presence of moisture or something else we can't explain.\" He said it seemed reasonable that the burn happened quickly. \"You are talking about no more than ten seconds in any one area, probably. Otherwise you would ignite it.\" Mrs. Budinger says she feels the 1500 degrees of heat from the torch used by Prof. Barndt was \"rather high and not very realistic, because polyester degrades rap- idly at 1 500 degrees F. So, it was my judge- ment that whatever source produced the quick burst of heat was in the tempera- ture range of 600-900 degrees F.\" When asked to explain the missing polyester thread, Prof. Barndt said, \"How about I have no idea why that could have happened....You'd almost have to have a very-a pinpoint heat source like a laser to do something like that.\" However, he said a laser could not have made the pat- tern on the sheet. Asked for his \"bottom line\" conclu- sions regarding the burned sheet, Prof. Barndt said, \"Oh, I can't explain it. The only thing I can tell you about it is there are obvious heat damage to the fabric. \"Surprisingly, the polyester has melted and the cotton has burned in some areas, but not all of them. It has the general shape, as you say, of a body. I would be at a loss to explain how a body could have been present in the amount of heat that was required to do the damage that you see here and not suffer serious bums. \"So, from a scientific standpoint, that's pretty much what I can tell you. I don't know exactly how this was done,\" Prof. Barndt concluded. Turning to the disk-shaped rocks, both Mrs. Budinger and Nick Reiter, of the Avalon Foundation, separately examined the two stones submitted. Mrs. Budinger's examination included infared (IR), and Reiter's included EDS tech- niques. Stone two was cut in two. Stere- omicroscope photos were also taken. It was noted that the rocks are similar August 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"in shape to Moqui rocks found in Utah and Arizona, and that they could have originated naturally in the Corguinho area of Brazil, since \"Brazil is known to have an iron-rich sandstone-type geology simi- lar to that of the U.S. Southwest,\" says Mrs. Budinger. \"Previous Earthfiles re- ports of the Brazil landscape also indi- cated this might be true.\" She adds, \"I suspect that the presence of titanium in the stone I examined could be a marker as to its origin. Mr. Reiter correctly indicated in our report that trace minerals vary with the local mineralogy in an area.\" Gevaerd, who has lived in the area for many years, says the explanation is simple: \"The hills around Urandir's place are covered with these stones. He sold them as extraterrestrial souvenirs. He has also done the rock fall from the sky rou- tine before, with the aid of his workers, impressing his followers.\" An Internet entry by a Pat Fish (patfish@luckyfish.com) says, \"Identical stones were once commonly found all over the Channel Islands, and I have a dozen in my possession that I bought from an old fisherman who picked them up on San Nicholas in the 1930's. He told me the Chumash Indians thought of them as good luck stones, and he thought they were droplets of volcanic lava that had swirled into stones as they hit the sea.. ..I bet the Natural History Museum has a lot ofthem.\" Reiter obtained a Moquis marble for comparison with the Brazil stones, and found that \"elemental composition (2 mm from the stone surface) is almost identi- cal to that from the exterior of a reference to Moqui Marble. The data show the #2 stone contains major amounts of Fe, Si, O, and Al, with very minor amounts of K, Ti,Mg,andC. \"A Moqui Marble reference contains the same major elements, except there is a small amount of Mn instead of Ti and C. This minor variation is likely, and would vary with the local mineralogy of the area and trace minerals in the water when the stones were formed.\" When asked what he had concluded, Reiter said, \"In my own professional opin- ion, neither the stone nor the cloth samples represented any anomaly what- soever. If indeed the stones in question are falling from the sky, then this would require documentation of a totally differ- ent sort. \"But without adequate evidence on that account, nothing otherwise that was brought to my attention seems to be un- usual. My personal opinion is that a hoax or disinformation is likely.\" Ms. Howe took stones to the University of Penn- sylvania for x-ray diffractometry (XRD). \"The XRD computer analy- sis produced a list of min- erals, starting with quartz,\" she says, \"which is the most abundant substance in the stones, and continu- ing in order of quantity: quartz, goethite, hematite, rutile (which contains tita- nium), albite, andcubanite. \"The mineral cubanite is very rare and strongly magnetic. Biophysicist W. C. Levengood had discovdered magnetic fields in two Corguinho stones I sent to his laboratory before the cubanite was discovered.\" Additional work on the stones was done by Prof. Gomaa Omar, described by Ms. Howe as \"a rock expert, published in Science, and has taught and researched at the University of Pennsylvania Depart- ment of Earth and Environmental Science for 25 years. He is puzzled about the ori- gin and creation mechanism of the sev- eral disk-shaped Corguinho stones that he examined.\" Prof. Omar reported to Ms. Howe: \"See the banding here in each one of these. In addition to the football shape, really the most important thing is the banding there. This is a mystery to me. I don't see it very often.. ..The stone is primarily an iron matrix in which quartz crystals are em- bedded.\" He said the stones had to originate as hot liquid iron, and that the quartz grains were floating in this iron.. ..\"But as to the banding and the stratification going from the center outward, that has something to do with spinning force that we were talking about before. That's the most likely explanation so far, and I really don't know what would cause this spinning force to form this....It would be nice to know how this happened.\" Even though the rocks are interesting to Prof. Omar, he does not believe they are extraterrestrial, as claimed by Urandir. In an email to an associate of Gevaerd, Prof. Omar said, \"Professor Johnson and I have always known that these rocks are of terrestrial origin. Based on scientific curiosity, we were only after characteriz- ing the mineralogical content of these rocks and determining the spatial relation- ship between the minerals. We did that.\" Conclusions With the key witness and his associ- ates having below zero credibility, all al- leged physical evidence becomes sus- Urandir talks to his followers.

There is, as already noted, the basic question of whether the sheets were switched and the bed moved between the time of the alleged abduction in Septem- ber and Ms. Howe's visit in February. The photos indicate that this is possible. There are also questions as to the ceil- ing image, and questions as to whether the images match Urandir's body. And why are the undershorts missing? Mrs. Budinger, a very well qualified scientist familiar with the UFO phenom- enon, spent many hours researching the materials in question. She wrote a 40- page report which indicates that she found no evidence of anything that could not be duplicated by humans. Prof. Barndt said he could not explain PageS MUFON UFO Journal August 2003"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Phyllis Budinger the burned areas, and indicated it would take much trial and error to duplicate the bums, but he did not indicate that the burns could not be duplicated by mortal man. Levengood's initial excitement over the burned material appears not to be as exciting as first thought. Thus the burned bedsheet and pillow do not support a claim that the burns are extraterrestrial in origin. What of the stones? Mrs. Budinger's and Mr. Reiter's work on the stones from Brazil did not indicate any sort of anomaly, and the conclusion was that they were most probably naturally-occurring in Bra- zil, similar to naturally-occurring stones found in Utah, New Mexico, and else- where. While the geologists who tested the stones indicated they had not seen any- thing like them before, this hardly makes the stones extraterrestrial-only unusual and outside their particular experience. University professors tend to be very specialized, even within a specific disci- pline. It may be significant that none of the rock experts consulted were from Ari- zona, Utah, California, or Brazil, where they might have been more likely to en- counter such stones. In fact, one must question why an in- dependent Brazilian rock expert has not been consulted by Ms. Howe. As already noted, Prof. Omar and Prof. Johnson have concluded the stones are not extraterrestrial in origin. The stones had always been especially suspect, because reliable sources have reported that similar stones were used previously in the Project Portal scams as extraterrestrial sales items and as \"rains of extraterrestrial rocks\" from the sky. Not only is the physical evidence in this case of little consequence, the inves- tigation itself and the reporting of the re- search on the physical items is also flawed. Ms. Howe went only to the alleged abductee and his supporters to obtain infor- mation and physical samples- the same group of biased in- dividuals who paid for her trip. Although she contacted Gevaerd prior to going to Bra- zil, she chose not to believe what he told her about Urandir and his associates, and did not contact Gevaerd or other Brazilian ufologists while in Brazil. Miss Howe still seems not to believe what Gevaerd, a re- spected ufologist, says about Urandir and his associates, but she appears to believe (and report) every negative thing that Urandir and his associates say about Gevaerd. A statement by Ms. Howe at the MUFON symposium requires special clarification. In response to a question by a member of the audience regarding whether Gevaerd was looking carefully enough at the physical evidence, Ms. Howe said the following: \"Yesterday Whitley Strieber told me that he had gotten email from Urandir Oliveira saying that the University of Pennsylvania scientists were ludicrous. Now I think that says just about all you need to know about Mr. Gevaerd.\" The wording itself does not make sense, but it seemed clear from the con- text of the statement, as well as the re- sponse by the questioner and the audi- ence, that .Ms. Howe was saying that Gevaerd was making this statement-al- though the origin of the information ap- parently came from Urandir. I asked Gevaerd if he had communi- cated anything regarding the scientists to Strieber, He said he had commented positively on Mrs. Budinger's study, and had pointed out that Prof. Omar had stated that the stones were not extrater- restrial in origin. Gevaerd denied saying anything about any of the scientists be- ing ludicrous. Regarding the study of the stones, Gevaerd had earlier said, \"It looks like the professor contacted by LMH found some unusual patterns in them, thus lead- ing the investigative journalist to accept the hoaxer's claim that they have extraor- dinary origin or nature. The professor would not speculate beyond his knowl- edge. It seems that LMH, once again, as with Phyllis Budinger, just jumped ahead.\" Although Ms. Howe has sought the scientific study of the physical items which she brought back, her interpreta- tions of test results appear to be less than objective. Moreover, she has not shared results negative to Urandir in a timely and unbiased manner. Mrs. Budinger, for example, has stated, \"It is my opinion that the Earthfiles website report utilized only minimal and carefully chosen excerpts from my final report, interspersed with comments which appear to disagree with my analysis by 'textile expert' Prof. Barndt. \"Additionally, I think this has been done in a deliberately misleading manner, completely devoid of any professional ob- jectivity.\" When I asked Ms. Howe why she had not presented any of Mrs. Budinger's re- search at the Ozark UFO Conference, she told me she had not gotten the results of the study prior to her presentation on April 12 at the conference. Mrs. Budinger, however, told me that she had phoned Ms. Howe to verbally give Ms. Howe the results of her study prior to Mrs. Howe's presentation on April 12 so that this information could be incorporated into the talk. In addition, another researcher who was familiar with Mrs. Budinger's find- ings suggested to Ms. Howe prior to the April 12 talk that Ms. Howe include the results in her presentation. But there was nothing about Mrs. Budinger's study in Ms. Howe's presentation at the Ozark conference, or during a somewhat heated argument about the case after her talk. A partial report of the Budinger re- search was presented on Earthfiles later in conjunction with findings by Prof. Barndt, as already noted. Whether there are additional negative studies of the physical evidence which have not been reported is not known. Bottom line Research on the alleged abductee, the physical \"evidence,\" and the investiga- tive procedures clearly indicate that the Urandir case is a hoax, as originally re- ported by Gevaerd. However, hoaxes such as this, sup- ported by a high-profile individual, die hard, and it seems likely that Urandir, po- tentially one of the more dangerous hoax- ers, will continue to be promoted. Another aspect of this case which should be of concern is the wasting of the very limited research capabilities available to ufologists on a case that should never have been pursued. Mrs. Budinger, for example, spent al- most two months on this case at no pay. She says, however, that \"on the good side, it has generated more samples for me from cases that have possibilities, and put me in contact with other researchers who can be valuable for the future.\" August 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"BLT Field Report Arkansas crop circle probably genuine - ••'•£\"^#3^ ^ ; ^* ; ^^^w ; &.M&-J.&- i^'^&A J^^cf^^W $ a &^fi^-*eS& In.

Circles in arms spaced approx. 10' apart, and with a slight curvature clockwise. Crop lay was reported to have been clock- wise, in all circles. Associated Phenomena: Several re- ports from local residents of unusual aerial light phenomena about 2 weeks prior to formation being discovered. A bird's nest (of a tree-nesting spe- cies) was found, unscathed and with eggs intact, on top of the flattened crop in one of the spiral-arm circles; the nearest trees estimated to be approx. 550' away. Multiple daytime photo anomalies, in- cluding an unusual object in one, and \"fogging\" in at least two aerial shots di- rectly over the formation at about 800'. Field Investigation (6/16/03): Because farmer Todd Young had cut the field al- most immediately after he discovered the formation, Ms. Scarpellini's first visit con- centrated on interviews with adjacent home-owners and local reporters who had visited the formation. Local residents and reporters who did enter the formation reported crisp edges to all the circles and the presence of the undisturbed bird's nest in one of the \"arm\" circles, with several eggs inside it, completely intact. Several people were located who had taken photos, although very few of these were taken inside the formation on the ground. Unfortunately none was taken of the bird's nest. Aerial view of Knobel crop circles (top), ground view (center), and enlargement of magnetic par- ticles (right). Field Investigation (6/25/03): Ms. Scarpellini returned on the 25 th to obtain negatives of some of the \"anomalous\" photos and to take soil samples. The farmer, Todd Young, stated that he had disced the field, down to about 2- 3 inches, and planted soybeans, but he was able to locate where the formation had been. Scarpellini then took soil samples from what had been the central circle and from each of the three circles in one of the \"arms\" (a total of 10 Ib. of soil). Control soils (3 Ib.) were taken 500' dis tant from a presumed edge of the spiral. No magnetic particles were evident on the surface. Magnetic particle concentration: These samples yielded the highest con- centration of magnetic material ever re- ported by the BLT Team in a crop circle: 30.29 mg/g soil. [The highest concentra- tion one might expect to find in \"normal\" Page 10 MUFON UFO Journal August 2003"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"soils is 0.4 mg/g soil.] This distribution level was the same in all of the circle samples. The particles, which were mag- netic, have a considerable range in size, with many clearly visible to the naked eye. Ms. Scarpellini's microscopic examina- tion revealed a mixture of irregularly- shaped rust-colored particles mixed in with smaller spherical, and partially ab- lated (rounded), shiny black particles. An SEM/EDS will be obtained to de- termine the sizes of the particles and their elemental content. NO magnetic material whatsoever was found in the control soils. COMMENT: Without plant samples to examine we have only the soil results (and possibly the anomalous photos) to help us determine this event's causative agency. Because a large number of crop for- mations world-wide, in which the plants have been found to contain anomalies, have also revealed magnetic particles in their soils in excess of \"normal,\" we know that this parameter is a good indicator of authenticity. The fact that under the microscope we can see both spherical and partially ab- lated particles here, the fact that there were NO magnetic particles found in the con- trol soils, and the fact that the concentra- tion in the circle samples was so great, all indicate that this formation was not me- chanically-flattened. W.C. Levengood and John Burke, in their 1995 paper (\"Semi-Molten Meteoric Iron Associated with a Crop Formation,\" J. Sci. Exploration 6:2,191-199) hypoth- esize that microscopic particles of mete- oric iron which are entering the earth's atmosphere constantly as meteors burn up in the upper atmosphere get drawn into a descending plasma vortex system. [Plasmas have strong magnetic fields associated with them and they also emit microwaves when they spiral.] The idea is that the meteoric debris is both drawn into the descending plasma vortex by its strong magnetic field and then heated to a molten state by the mi- crowaves emitted by the spiraling plasma. The molten, and now magnetized, par- ticles then form spheres and particles with partially rounded surfaces as they cool on the way down to the earth's surface, and are left in the soil in the crop circle area as the plasma vortex impacts the field. This theory is the most reasonable yet offered to explain the presence of these magnetic particles in so many crop circle soils, all over the world. The hypothesis that a plasma energy system of some sort is involved is also borne out by years of laboratory work documenting the typical changes to plants at crop circle sites. Additionally, the \"fogging\" effect in several of the aerial photos (photos taken at about 800' up in the air above the for- mation) is very similar to other cases in England, cases where the laboratory work again indicated a non-mechanical source of the crop formation. There are a number of indications that, in some crop formations, there is some sort of remnant energy...an energy which can interfere with battery function (cam- eras, watches, cell phones, etc.), as well as animals and sometimes people, and which appears to linger in some cases for several weeks after the original event. There is growing evidence that, in some cases, this energy extends UP- WARDS into the air above the circles....perhaps in this case to 800' above the crop surface. More work on the nega- tives may provide additonal information. Whether the unusual aerial light phe- nomena reported by at least two local resi- dents two weeks prior to the arrival of the circle was in any way related to it is un- known. RESULT: Probably genuine (not me- chanically-flattened), but without the plant work we cannot be certain. Nancy Talbott BLT Research Team Inc.

Astronomers find planetary system similar to ours By Dr. David Whitehouse BBC News science editor Astronomers have found a.planetary system similar to ours-a Jupiter-like world circling a Sun-like star in roughly the same orbit that Jupiter follows around our Sun. Of the 100 or so other planetary systems known, this one more closely resembles ours than any other found thus far. Researchers speculate that this sys- tem may contain other worlds, such as smaller rocky planets like Earth, either in orbit around the star or around the Jupi- ter-like world itself. The planet's parent star, called HD 70642, is slightly too faint to be seen with the unaided eye, but is easily visible in the southern sky using binoculars. At just 95 light-years away, the gas- giant planet, bathed in the light of a yel- low-dwarf star, is on our galactic door- step. Like Jupiter, its atmosphere could be mottled and streaked with wind pat- terns and weather systems. Dark-red methane clouds may scurry across its face beneath a high-altitude frosting of bright ammonia crystals. At its poles, aurora may glisten and light- ning bolts pulse across its night-time face. The planet detected orbiting HD 70642 is not the first Jupiter-class world to be found circling another star. All of the plan- etary systems found so far contain gas giants like Jupiter. But the interest in this system is not principally because of what we know is there, but rather because of what else we suspect may be lurking unseen around the star and its planet. There could be other worlds, smaller and rocky-possibly Earth-like. These are currently below the limits of our detect- ability. \"This is the closest we have yet got to a real Solar System-like planet, and advances our search for systems that are even more like our own,\" says Hugh Jones of Liverpool John Moores Univer- sity, UK, who helped discover the new world.

Georgia hovering object HELEN - Tom Sheets, MUFON Geor- gia Director, reports that on May 13,2003, a married Tennessee couple was visiting the Blue Ridge Mountains and lodging at one of the motels when at 11:30 PM the woman noticed a white flashing light moving slowly over a nearby ridgeline. The craft stopped and began to hover. She noticed that the red, blue, and green lights did not appear to be like any stan- dard aircraft. Her husband had gone to the motel of- fice, so she ran in and grabbed their video camera and began to take footage of the object. He returned in about 15 minutes, and the craft was still in place. The ob- ject vanished after 30 to 45 minutes, but not before two similar craft appeared. These also vanished. The crafts were saucer-shaped with an apparent size of a penny at arm's length. They flew at an estimated altitude of 500 feet, at less than one mile. They moved in a straight-line path before taking up their extended hover, and seemed to fade in and out, all against a cloud cover. The lights were steady, but then seemed to also pulsate. Duration of the event was thirty to sixty minutes. They are submitting a copy of the video to MUFONGA for analysis.

She was pounding on the front door, so shaken she was unable to get her key into the lock. It was very disturb- ing for me to see my wife going through the fear she was experiencing and I as- sumed she had been assaulted or raped. \"As I was getting ready to call the po- lice, she calmed down somewhat and told me to put the phone down-that it would not do any good anyway. Confused and shaken I asked why? She explained that as she was pulling into our apartment complex, she noticed what appeared to be a small child playing around a large steel waste dumpster in the corner of the parking lot about 15 feet from her. \" She got out of her car to get her brief- case and saw movement out of her pe- riphery. Her next concern was whether this child was too young to be playing out in the dark late at night. She began to slowly walk towards the dumpster to ask where the child's parents were. \" As she approached the dumpster she could make out the contrasting shape of a head peeking out from one corner as she calmly spoke. \"She approached to within 6-8 feet when she heard a loud banging noise and this 'child' suddenly had the ability to high jump 5 feet. It was then standing on top of the dumpster's steel lid staring down at her. \"At this point she described feeling a pressure in her head, nausea, and dizzi- ness. She told me she strained to identify if it was a neighborhood child who was staring at her for about 20-30 seconds, a kind of'standoff.' \"Just as she realized this was not a child, the 'being' produced a glowing- white orb of light about the size of vol- leyball in its hands and held on to it at about chest height. The light cast off from the glowing orb illuminated its head for several seconds and she described a large almond-shaped head with big black eyes staring intently at her movements. \"She told me that she just stood there in stunned silence trying to understand. Everything was happening in slow mo- tion. The 'being' seemed to tighten its grasp on the glowing orb of light, and it jumped feet first into the dumpster and disappeared without making any noise. \"Right after that is when she began to breakdown emotionally and run to the apartment. Between the time she entered our apartment and calming her down and debriefing her was about an hour. \"With much reluctance-I'll admit I was really crept out to do this-I went back out to the exact spot she described with my metal softball bat and D-Cell Mag-Lite.

On June 20, he sighted the triangle again, with flashing lights hovering 125 meters above a house. He drove to the object, and the UFO gradually departed and accelerated. The biker had to speed up to 20 km/h to keep up. Somewhat farther, the object halted again above a house. The witness put his motorcycle aside and waved to it, but there was no reaction and no sound. From beneath, it looked like a triangle, but without sharp edges. Besides the flashing lights, the object had blue and red lights.

The commander called the control tower to report having observed a strange and large elongated \"missile-like\" object coming towards him from the opposite direction, and passing very close under- neath the plane. The alarm involved ENAV (the Na- tional Flight Assistance Agency), ENAC (Civil Aviation National Agency), ASV (Flight Security National Agency), the Ministry of Transportation Services, and the First Minister Crisis Unit, featuring the activation of the usual security pro- cedures. In the report drafted the following day, the commander described an \"unidenti- fied flying object\" approaching him at an altitude of approximately 8000 feet: it was cylindrical in form, 3 to 4 meters in length, white in color, and reflected the sun rays. The object, observed by both pilots, was reportedly not detected by radar sys- tems. For security reasons, however, the state prosecutor in Naples opened an investigation and confiscated the radar recordings and the tape recordings of dia- logue between the aircraft and the con- trol tower.

The disc looked similar to a garbage can lid, and was only slightly smaller in diameter than the fighter aircraft was long. The professor estimated the diameter or the disc at fifty to sixty feet. He felt our understanding of physics was very wrong after seeing the perfor- mance characteristics of this UFO.

Tennessee glowing object ARDMORE - Brian Vike reports that in early June a couple was coming home about 9 PM when they got a glimpse of a very bright light off to the north, not very high up, over the tree tops. It was more of a glowing or illumination! The witness told her husband to look up, but he said it was a plane. She states, \"I told him that it was not a plane, and since it was moving slow, I was going to follow it, and we did. We took back roads and tried to keep it in sight. At one point, we went down a dirt road and it looked like it just hovered above the trees, maybe 1500 feet or so. \"It was a giant egg-shaped object. One thing for sure, it was something I had never seen before. There was no sound at all, and it was moving very slowly. Not once did it speed up. As it moved out of sight, we had to drive a short distance to be able to see it again, and it was moving southwest. \"We followed the object for 30 to 45 minutes. As we got into town, where we could see it better, it was moving higher. It was an inch and half to 2 inches in size at arm's length. It never made a sudden movement, and never sped up. \"It was the color of a fluorescent light, glowing and putting off a lot of light. It was oval shaped, with the egg lying on its side. My husband said it was prob- ably a blimp, but it flew too slow and low. Later, I was talking to a friend and told her about it, and she remembered she had seen it also.\" Thanks to Brian Vike, Di- rector HBCC UFO hbccufo@telus.net Nevada luminous object Rachel - The witness reports, \"On Wednesday, July 9, at about 9:30, Ike Bishop and I, together with two friends, met at the Little'aleinn. We drove to the Mailbox Road on the famous Extraterres- trial Highway 375, twenty miles west of Rachel, and our friends were facing east, while Ike and I were facing west. \"They started to holler and point to the east. I turned around in time to see a bright, luminous object about ten de- grees above the Tikaboo Peak horizon, moving from north to south. I saw it drift for about one-second, then plunge straight down behind Tikaboo Peak. \"The others observed this object for a total of about five seconds. The object was as bright as the moon, and about 50 feet in diameter. It's circular shape was clearly defined and not just a luminous glowing light. Tikaboo Peak is about 11 miles from Mailbox Road.\" Thanks to Gary Emry glemry@cableone. net Puerto Rico ruby red lights SE COAST — A former US Infantry officer and 3,000-hour commercial pilot writes, \"My wife and I live on the SE coast of Puerto Rico, and we are in the habit of sitting on our roof at night looking at the sky, since it's cooler and breezier up there. \"Three months ago, at about 11 PM, on a clear night, we both became aware, simultaneously, of three ruby-red lights, bright and distinctly visible, like car tail- lights or red aircraft navigation lights. \"They were approaching us from south to north, as we viewed them, in a sym- metric V formation, one leading and two trailing. After three seconds of this mo- tion, the three lights diverged, the lead light continuing straight, each of the trail- ing lights turning 90 degrees away from the original direction of motion. \"The lights passed more or less over- head as they made this divergence, then they didn't fade away into the distance, but simply vanished out of sight. In about two seconds, pouf, they're gone. \"We had the 'impression' that they were several thousand feet above sea level, and that the rate of movement must have been much faster than our fastest fighters.\" Thanks to Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Hotline 1 866 262 1989 218 UK constables see UFOs Toby Manhire of the \"The Guardian \" reports, \"If you need convincing the truth is out there, what better authority than the British constabulary? \"In UFO Magazine (July), Gary Heseltine, detective constable No 1877 of the British transport police, presented the results of a year's work compiling police officers' observations of unidenti- fied flying objects. \"The last 12 months have literally flown by,\" recounted Heseltine. \"But his feet were firmly on the ground as he presented a database bulging with encounters of the first, second and third kind-a total of 84 incidents spanning the period from 1950 to 2002, involving more than 200 police officers.

Witness reports: Saucer hovers over Utah mountain Reported by Somers Pfeuffer It was late October, 2001, while driv- ing north on 1-15 on my way to Wyo- ming to see my cousin. I had left Las Vegas early and stopped in Beaver, Utah, for gas and a breakfast sandwich. About forty miles north of Beaver there is a mountain range where I saw this saucer sitting between two moun- tain tops. It was huge, and I was really astounded. It just sat there. It didn't wiggle or wobble. I immediately looked at the clock, aware of this missing time thing, and it was exactly 10:3 0 AM. Of course I slowed to a crawl and moved over to the side of the road. There was other traffic, but not a lot. Probably, if I had stopped and waived to others they may have stopped also. It was almost impossible to miss 'this thing unless one drove with blinders on and just stared at the highway. I drove toward Fillmore, the next town, for at least fifteen more miles at a very slow pace and this saucer did not move. Eventually the mountain ob- scured the saucer. I have read many descriptions of UFOs concerning then- shapes and col- ors. This was a typical saucer shape, and the color was pewter. Silver but not shiny. The dome, in my estimation, was small in comparison to the size of the saucer. Since the UFO sat there so long I had the feeling that it was not there ob- serving, but rather making a statement, \"Look, here we are.\" This thing was just beautiful and to me an epiphany. This was a bright sunny day with- out a cloud in the sky, but unfortunately I didn't have a camera. Now, however, I never go anywhere without one. I went to Utah several times to get a picture of the mountain. Once the film was not good and the second one clouds obscured the sight. This time there was some haze when I took the pictures. I still get excited when telling this story and I hope someday to see this again.

Evans, 2003, Alarm Clock Publishing, P.O. Box 1389, Ceredo, WV 25507,6x9 soft cover, 282 pages plus Appendix, Bibliography, and Index, $29.95. Reviewed by Dwight Connelly This book is not as \"far out\" as the title and cover would suggest. Evans, who describes him- self as an amateur sci- entist and inventor, explains that this vol- ume has been con- densed down from 400 pages. Still, it contains a great deal of material, from re- viewing the field of modern ufology in part 1 to looking at ancient writings which may be related to UFOs in part 2. Evans says of the book, \"This writing is not pro alien, nor is it an effort to de- bunk any known possibilities. Rather, it is one author's gloved attempt to sift through a moun- tain of preconceived notions that may have left a wobbly and confused founda- tion in recounting modern UFO history.\" He says he feels \"it is important to em- phasize caution toward any euphoric no- tion that the entities behind alien abduc- tions might be engaged in a humanitarian mission-when viewed in the sense they might be our 'space brothers.' In fact, human logic tends to dictate otherwise.\" Like many other researchers, Evans sees the probable involvement of the government in debunking and hiding in- formation. His sources for UFO cases and reports, which he utilizes mostly in looking for patterns, are a mixture of reli- able and questionable. He observes, however, that \"the real issues are mostly established by the testimonies of the first- hand witnesses: common people who- through their natural and intuitive bear- ings-have come to realize that they have seen and/or experienced something that was out of the ordinary.\" One of the interesting cases discussed by Evans is the famous Maury Island encounter, which was investigated in part by Kenneth Arnold. Among the many interesting details brought out in this chapter is the fact that Fred Crisman, sup- posedly the employer of one of the wit- nesses, was later tied into the Kennedy assassination investigation by New Or- leans District Attorney Garrison as an undercover operative, possibly con- nected to the CIA. A significant portion of the book deals with Andrea Roberts, who has a history of consciously-recalled encounters, be- ginning in childhood, including the ef- fects that a light seemed to have on her father. A particularly interesting aspect of this case is the fact that Ms. Roberts' blood type switches, such as from type A to type O. In looking at. the whole picture, Evans concludes that there has been an ongoing interaction between entities and mankind \"over the course of thousands of years.\" He adds, \"Research tends to suggest that a grand scheme was formerly conceived in the distant past, and, similarly, has been pa- tiently allowed to un- fold.\" In discussing this ancient past, Evans is aware that he is dealing with sensitive issues. \"Some readers may at first react to this material as if it were sacrilegious or goes against their religious teachings,\" he says. \"To the contrary, the verses we review may serve to explain certain truths that are long-since forgotten, while possibly defining the nature and purposes behind their original themes, as viewed by the ancient patriarchs who attempted to de- scribe what they saw and heard. It is not the intent of this segment to postulate religious theory, but rather to offer his- torical parallels that hint of interactions that might have occurred between ancient men and higher beings in the distant past.\" There is much more, of course, in this lengthy book which attempts to cover both the ancient and modern history of UFOs. The Appendix features documenta- tion of the blood-type shifts of Ms. Rob- erts, the Bibliography lists 49 books of varying quality, and there is a helpful in- dex. If there is a criticism of Evans' efforts, it would be that he tries to cover too much, does not always zero in on the best cases, and sometimes explains and speculates in too much detail. Yet one has to be impressed, for the most part, by the ex- tensive research and the incisive think- ing that has gone into this effort to deal with a very complicated topic. This is not light reading, but it should be quite interesting to anyone who wants to explore what the agenda(s) of UFOs and entities might be-a question whose answer continues to elude most of us. Dear Forum Editor, Re \"Fire lookouts see anomalies\" in MUFON UFO JoumalWo. 422, June 2003: the description on page 5-\"shadows seemed to cast onto the object, even though the light seemed to be coming from it\"-is worth comparing with testi- mony from Bentwaters, 30 December 1980. See page 216 in either edition of the 1984 Prentice Hall book by Fawcett & Greenwood (The book was first titled UFO Cover-Up and then Clear Intent): \"the men walked around the object and noticed an interesting effect...shadows would appear to advance one pace more and then stop.\" The account adds that shadows were cast \"probably by bright 'light-alls' in the field.\" Considering the similar fire lookout case, that opinion may be wrong. A cor- rect interpretation may be much more pro- found. -Thomas M. Olsen Gordon Creighton, 95, long-time editor of the UK's Flying Saucer Review (FSR), died July 16.

Friedman Frequently-Asked Questions I was very busy at the MUFON 2003 Symposium in Dearborn, MI, July 4-6. Mostly I was answering questions after my lecture \"Critiquing the Roswell Crit- ics,\" during my workshop on \"UFOs: The Cosmic Watergate,\" during the speakers' panel, and while manning my ven- dor table behind my various books, videos, and pa- pers. Mostly the questioners were looking for an- swers to why, rather than dealing with specific facts. Facts are gener- ally the focus of Stanton Friedman my presentations, but people still want to know why. Or How come? I thought it might be useful for me to deal with a number of these. One unexpected problem that devel- oped was that rather than my workshop consisting of a small informal group of people in a small room, it was held for a few hundred in the main speaker's hall. I had planned to avoid using slides and to make good use of my paper, \"The Cosmic Watergate,\" which includes a number of quotes helping to establish that there is a coverup by US govern- ment agencies of UFO data, and to show the blacked out and whited out UFO docu- ments issued by the CIA, NSA, etc. Why the coverup? Of course, when I answered the inevi- table question, \"Why the coverup?,\" I had to preface my remarks with the obvi- ous caveat that I do NOT speak for the US government, but here are the reasons which I think have kept all governments from wanting to release the best data- from crashes, the best multiple witness radar visual cases, physical trace cases, etc: 1. They want to figure out the method of propulsion and the method of manu- facture of the high-strength, lightweight materials used in constructing them, along with electronics and other unique devices. Flying saucers do make wonderful weapons delivery and defense systems. Page 18 Even though the cold war is over, there is no shortage of governments trying to find more efficient ways ofkilling their enemies, better ways of delivering nuclear and other Weapons of Mass Destruction, and keeping enemies from delivering theirs. Rule number 1 for security: one can't tell one's friends without telling one's en- emies. 2. What if \"The other guy\" figures out how they work before we do; how do we defend? We don't want them to know we know that they know. 3. What if an announcement were made by two individuals highly trusted around the world that some UFOs are ET space- craft (we could have a competition to fig- ure out an appropriate pair. Maybe the Queen and the Pope?) What would happen? Church atten- dance and mental hospital admissions would go up, stock markets would go down, and the younger generation would push for an earthling orientation rather than the nationalistic or religious ones insisted upon by governments. I know of no governing body that wants its citizens to owe their primary al- legiance to the Planet rather than to that body. Those in power want to stay in power. 4. Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell have loudly proclaimed UFOs are the work of the devil, and that we are the only in- telligent beings in the universe. They would be up a religious creek without a paddle if an announcement were made. The votes of their followers are very im- portant. 5. If an announcement about peaceful alien visitors were made, many would ex- pect that, since they are obviously tech- nologically superior, soon there would be new methods of energy production, ground and air transport, computers, and communications. Economic chaos would ensue, such as happened when Eastern Europe ac- cepted freedom, democracy, elections, and capitalism. They haven't benefited much. We are not good at large-scale eco- nomic transitions. 6. What if the government were to ad- mit that many pilots had been lost chas- ing and trying to shoot down saucers? I have heard half a dozen cases of several planes going up and fewer coming down. Both the USSR and the USA shot down \"enemy\" planes doing reconnaissance MUFON UFO Journal too close to their borders. Neither side said a word for decades. Families were lied to, too. Why Come Here? Often the next question would be, but why would any aliens want to come here from hundreds or thousands of light years away? I have to point out that within only 54 light years there are 1000 stars, of which 46 are similar to the sun and probably have planets and life. One pair, Zeta 1 and Zeta 2 Reticuli, are, after all, only 1 /8th of a light year apart from each other, only 39 light years away from us, and a billion years older than the sun. So why worry about distant stars and ignore those in our own backyard? Then I go into a quick list of reasons for coming here (26 are in my 1975 MUFON paper). But I finish by saying I think they are here primarily to quaran- tine us, because we are such a primitive society whose major activity is obviously tribal warfare. At the end of WWII, during which we Earthlings killed 50 million of our own kind and destroyed 1700 cities, it would have been perfectly obvious to alien observ- ers that soon we would be moving out, based upon the obvious development of nuclear weapons, large rockets, and ra- dar (electronics). Southeastern New Mexico was the only site on Earth where all three of these new technologies could be studied. Surely it is not a coincidence that Roswell and White Sands Missile Range were in that area where the first nuclear bomb was exploded, where the captured German V-2 rockets were being tested, and where we had our best tracking radar following the often errant missiles. But wouldn't you expect them to make official contact with us? In the first place we don't know that they haven't. In the second place, why? They hold the cards. Certainly nothing any aliens have done to Earthlings can match what other Earthlings have done to Earthlings. They may well be being kind to dumb animals. But Isaac Asimov and others have suggested if they neither make themselves publicly obvious (land in the middle of the World Soccer Cup?) nor don't hide from us, they must not be coming here! Of course we all know that science fic- tion writers are experts on the behavior of aliens, even if they totally ignore the August 2003"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"data related to observations of those aliens and their craft. The geologists among them may be concerned that we, over the past 100 years, have developed a strong interest in a number of very dense rare metals that have special characteristics, but are likely to be more abundant here (because Earth is the densest planet in the solar system) than on nearby planets. These could include such dense ex- otica as rhenium, platinum, uranium, os- mium, tungsten, gold-all with densities much greater than that of lead, and with various special metallurgical characteris- tics. Why abductions? But why abductions, then? Who knows? Genetic manipulations, hybridiza- tion, search for genetic diseases? Or maybe to determine how much our ge- netic makeup has changed from what it was when our ancestors were dropped off here to colonize the place, or as pris- oners on Earth, the Devils Island of this corner of the galaxy. We don't understand serial killers or child molesters very well, but they are real. The biologists among them may just be on field trips, doing graduate theses. Why do UFOs crash? Well , OK, but if aliens are so ad- vanced, and their materials are so strong, how could the saucer wind up in small pieces on the debris field near Corona? I had to point out to a number of people that the steel and concrete remains of the Oklahoma bombing were still strong and hard though in small pieces instead of big pieces. The materials weren't atomized as in a nuclear blast, nor dissolved as hi a bath of acid. A tracking radar (or lightning bolt) known to be on in the Roswell area, for example, may have induced guidance problems for one or both of a pair of sau- cers moving along-or created a problem with an electro magnetic propulsion sys- tem, causing a mid-air collision or the dumping of a lot of energy hi to the skin of one or both of the saucers. How about Robert Lazar? Why don't you believe in Robert Lazar? He certainly sounds sensible. Yes, he does. However nothing about him checks out at five different offices at MIT, at Cal Tech, or at Los Alamos (he worked there briefly for a subcontractor not for the lab). His high school said he finished in the bottom third of his class, he didn't gradu- ate with his class, the physics professor, Dr. William Duxler, he claimed he had at Cal Tech, never taught there, but only at Pierce Junior College in Southern Califor- August 2003 nia where Bob was at the very same time when he was supposedly at MIT 2500 miles away. The element 115 scheme makes no sense, etc. There is an article at my website and in TOP SECRET/MAJIC. How about Col. Corso? Don't you think Lt. Colonel Corso's story is an important piece of the UFO story? No, there is no substantiation in his book, he overstated his government role (he was not a member of the NSC, was not a buddy to J.E. Hoover, etc). There is an article on the website. Why is the press so negative? Why has the press been so negative? Again I don't speak for the press, but I have observed them a lot since giving my first lecture 36 years ago. The big city press seems to suffer from the David Susskind Syndrome. I did a program with David 30 years ago. They, like David, take great pride hi knowing about everything that is impor- tant: If some UFOs were really alien space craft, that would be important. But if it were important, we would know about it and we don't, so why waste our tune on this nonsense? Terry Hansen's book The Missing Times certainly makes a strong case for major media often being in bed with gov- ernment, which most definitely adds to the problem. The recent fuss at the New York Times shows that truth has not al- ways been the major concern of the press. It would be fun to see a debate be- tween a team of knowledgeable scientists and top journalists. Or for that matter be- tween ufologists and SETI cultists who are so opposed to flying saucers, but so enamored with listening for signals. My debate challenge to SETI Specialist Dr. Seth Shostak has been refused. Why are you opposed to SETI? If there were no evidence of alien visi- tations, then I would be interested, par- ticularly in optical SETI. But almost all the literature of the so-called science is based on wild conjectures, including such weird notions as that there is no evidence for UFOs, interstellar travel is impossible, wherever there is life out there it had to have originated at that location, that there is no colonization or migration, that ra- dio is the most advanced means of long distance communication, that there is no national security aspect to flying saucers, and that SETI cultists are knowledgeable about behavior patterns of earthlings, no less aliens. Look at their books and papers and study their references, or, in most cases, the absence of relevant references. As- tronomers, hi particular, are not qualified to talk about astronautics or behavior of MUFON UFO Journal ETI or UFOs any more than the sci-fi writ- ers who also have no qualms about speak- ing on these topics. That surely hasn't stopped them. I wish they knew as much about ufology as I know about setiology. Isn't intersteller travel limited? Doesn't the fact that the speed of light is the absolute limit for movement of any- thing forever prohibit interstellar travel? There are several answers here: A. No reason to assume that each small saucer observed here hi our atmo- sphere just came here from another solar system. There may well be bases hi the local neighborhood. Huge mother ships flitting between the stars may well warp space and time with white holes, black holes, worm holes or clever techniques about which we know nothing. One doesn't need or want speeds even close to the speed of light hi a planetary atmosphere. Hard to meet somebody for lunch when going around the earth in l/7of a second. B. Remember, too, that pilots moving at 99.99% of the speed of light only age a bit more than 6 months while travelling a distance of 39 light years. C. Limits related to the increase of mass at speeds close to the speed of light are irrelevant if the acceleration is pro- duced by cosmic freeloading or the pro- duction of very high energy charged par- ticles hi appropriate fusion reactions such as Deuterium-Helium 3. D. Though it is tough on our egos, I see no reason at all to assume we know all there is to know about flight or com- munication technology.

Inevitably this causes anyone who thinks deeply about the subject to question our own opinions as to whether there is anything real behind the UFO mystery at all, as a wave of negativism sweeps the field. When I considered the cases that still impressed me I was struck by how UFOlogy is very much a field of perspec- tives. How ever you tend to view things affects quite considerably the manner with which you approach any case. Skeptics look at a case already certain that it must fail, seeking any answer to consign it to the trash can. Rational investigators accept nega- tive evidence with the philosophy that not all UFO sightings will remain un- solved. Indeed most, based on past ex- perience, clearly will not. So they embrace the findings and move on. Enthusiasts, those who treat UFOlogy rather like a game of poker with the pow- ers that be, tend to ignore any problems because the case, as a case, is what mat- ters. Since it only becomes a useful asset if it remains unassailable, it tends to take on an air of invulnerability that it may not always deserve. What makes a good case? If you asked yourself what makes a really good case I dare say that few of us would end up with the same answer. Most would plump for multiple witnesses tied to some kind of physical evidence and/or radar or film footage from multiple loca- tions that offer independent verification. Such cases are, understandably, not in abundance, and even they are not im- mune to the shadow of demystification. One case I spent a long time on (20 years on and off) involved cine film evidence and multiple witnesses at three indepen- dent locations. But it was solved in the end thanks to a combination of good for- tune and perseverence. The UFO was an aircraft ejecting blaz- ing fuel that got trapped by a freak ther- mal layer into a short-lived, but very real, \"fireball.\" The solution proved more important here than the UFO case (this event hap- pened right on top of a junior grade school with potentially catastrophic con- sequences). But do you hear any kind of public outcry about this? Not at all. Yet TV programs were made about the case when it was deemed to be a UFO, includ- ing one in which a noted skeptic and sci- ence writer offered the wonderfully ab- surd '\"explanation\" that it was a meteor. Slight problem, as UFOlogists discov- ered on day one, but said \"expert\" had not bothered to check: there was full cloud cover at under 2000 feet. No me- teor could have flown that low without its impact becoming obvious. You might think it odd that one of the cases that has impressed me the most in recent years does so from the kind of evi- dence that would cause a skeptic to write it off without even trying-on the pretext that single witness events always can be assumed to be lies, illusions, etc, etc. Happily, UFOlogists do not fall for such cop-outs, which is really just an ex- cuse not to have to think too hard about the events. And whilst I absolutely agree that we should strive for hard evidence and multiple witnesses and assign proper merit to these cases, they are not, per se, greater cases because they possess these attributes. An ideal case A case that impresses me does so for reasons very different from those likely to impress even other UFOlogists. We are back to those perspectives again. It was first told to a friend who is a local folklore investigator, and who con- veyed details to me knowing of my UFO interest. It was never reported in that con- text, but if this is not a UFO case, good- ness knows what is. Briefly, on 16 June, 1991, a business- man was returning from a meeting (where he had drunk only coffee-though lots of it) and stopped at a beauty spot in Staffordshire known as Rudyard Lake (in- cidentally, from where writer Rudyard Kipling got his name). It was 1:30 AM, dark and deserted, but a mild night. His intention was to relieve himself of excess coffee, but he discovered a golden ball of light hovering on top of some standing stones, part of an ancient monu- ment of Neolithic origin. As he watched the ball of light, it moved towards him, spraying sparks of electricity towards the ground. Not surprisingly fearful, he climbed back into his car to discover it was totally drained of all power-neither lights nor en- gine would fire. Getting out, hoping to fix it, he now saw that the ball of light was closer, and he was swamped by strange physical sensations. A heavy pressure was pushing him into the ground, his level of conscious- ness was fading, and there were tingling sensations over his body and a shooting pain behind his eyes. He crashed to the ground, losing all further recall. An unknown time later, he awoke on the ground, feeling light-headed and dis- orientated. He literally had to crawl through some bushes looking for his car (he was only a few feet from it), and fell when he tried to stand. He noticed that his shirt and shoes were missing (he has no idea why, and they were in fact next to the car by the spot where he lost consciousness). As he brushed the dirt off his clothing and (still lacking bodily coordination) gingerly got dressed, sparks of static electricity shot out from the clothing. He stumbled into the car, relieved to find that it was working perfectly, and the keys were still in the ignition where he had left them. But it was now 3:05 AM. Over 90 minutes had disappeared during his period of unconsciousness. Reactions It is easy to write this case off as a dream or fantasy, and no doubt most skep- tics will do precisely that, relieving them of any obligation to really ask what it means. Many UFOlogists would perceive its Page 20 MUFON UFO Journal August 2003"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"merit as limited, even though this man was an impeccable witness. He has zero inter- est in publicity, being a major business- man with much to lose if those he worked with considered that he saw strange things. In such circumstances, sadly, most witnesses never do speak up, and we miss impressive cases for that reason. To me this man's motivations are vital. Of course, many other UFOlogists would immediately regard this as an ab- duction, and presume that during the \"missing time\" there is a \"hidden memory\" of some kind of alien contact. No doubt this would explain why his clothes were found on the ground. The aliens did it after some kind of probe. In this situation, a lot of UFO groups would persuade this man to have regres- sion hypnosis to seek out this missing part of his story. We know this because it has happened often in similar scenarios. And I have very little doubt that if they succeed, then some kind of \"story\" would emerge. What I cannot at all be certain of is that this story would reflect any actual event. Hypnosis generates fantasy much as it stimulates recall, and here the end result could quite frankly be either. In my view it would be dangerous and mislead- ing to even consider using hypnosis in this situation. Thankfully this has never happened, as the witness has no interest in hypno- sis, nor any belief that he was anything other than unconscious during the miss- ing 90 minutes. Indeed, in many similar UFO encounters, I suspect witnesses of- ten think that way until UFOlogists con- vince them otherwise. The human desire to plug any gap in memory is powerful, especially when given a boost by people taking undue interest in you because they think your story will add to their knowledge of alien abductions. Either the abduction or a period of un- consciousness view is valid here, and I feel we should err on the side of caution- not seeking to add to this story any di- mensions that we have no proven way to demonstrate it really ever possessed. Yet to me this is a hugely impressive case for one simple reason. It is consis- tent with a type of phenomenon that is widely reported. Many of the relatively obscure fea- tures in this story (such as the static elec- tric charge left on clothing, and the tem- porary loss of muscle coordination in the aftermath) scream out from case after case if you look deep into the evidence. You often need to look only at what we really know—minus any aspects tacked on later via hypnosis. I have collected literally dozens of cases that are nearly the same as this one, and from all over the world. They are not always even reported in a UFO context. Without any doubt these cases reflect a genuine, physically real phenomenon whose origin we do not yet understand. They are so much of a pattern that those scientists who allege that they would study UFOlogy if it ever offered a consistent stream of evidence that could be investigated are shown to be mistaken by believing that it has not yet been iden- tified. The evidence exists. The data is out there. Sadly, too many scientists flee from looking for such evidence, not because it lacks inherent strength, but because of the weaknesses added into it by a UFO community who tend to take the data sev- eral steps too far when seeking to justify a theory about UFOs (usually that it in- volves alien contact). Their perspective on the case urges them to do so, but I wonder if they don't dilute the power of the case by so doing. These cases prove merely that some- thing truly fascinating, of clear physical dimensions, with predictable effects and scientifically analysable features, is oc- curring all over the world. By all defini- tions this is a real UFO phenomenon. It demonstrates why we should still be pursuing this mystery, not abandon- ing it at speed. If only we could recognize the impor- tance of the data that we have already uncovered, and stop finding answers before we have even realized the right questions to ask about what these cases mean. Strange light at Georgia airport By Tom Sheets Georgia State Director MUFONGA's Michael Hitt has ad- vised me that a witness who had recently approached him has now provided initial information regarding a 17 Feb 2000 night event. The preliminary interview revealed that this witness, an adult male in his thir- ties, was at Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport along with other family members. They were awaiting the arrival of an interna- tional flight in order to meet their parents. This was an auspicious occasion for all, and a video camera had been brought along to record the reunion. While wait- ing, the witness observed a round bright light in the sky that seemed different from the typical lights seen in such areas-i.e. landing aircraft, approaching aircraft lights etc. This particular white light was pulsat- ing and began to change position by moving and darting up and down in a dra- matically noticeable fashion. The witness then began to videotape the bright light as it loitered in the same general airspace, recording its unusual movements. At one point the light, its approximate apparent size being that of a pencil eraser, seemed to shape shift from round to a sort of jelly-like shape. During this video sequence, a portion of a building was captured on the tape, lending some per- spective to the event. The other family members also ob- served this activity during it's approxi- mate twenty-minute duration. Upon con- clusion, the light zipped away vertically at such great speed that it appeared as a streaking blur. Michael has made an initial inspec- tion of the video and indicates that he detected a slight tint of red in the light. Michael stated that thus far, there appears to be no indication that this event is any- thing other than what has been described: a family group being in the right place to view an aerial light/object that appeared radically different from routine airport area traffic. MUFONGA frequently receives re- ports of darting, chasing nocturnal lights, and as a general rule these are usually distant, star-like lights, perhaps indistin- guishable from the average star except for their quick and bizarre maneuvers. This case and it's video seems to go much beyond that. ' We have here a light that appears sub- stantial in size or is much closer than the average \"nocturnal light.\" Its apparent change of shape also seems unusual. While atmospheric conditions and/or viewing conditions might cause aircraft lights or any aerial lights to take on un- usual characteristics, the darting move- ments and its very fast vertical departure calls for closer scrutiny. Lastly MUFONGA has investigated several solid events involving \"un- knowns\" in relative close proximity to Hartsfield Airport, and of course the vari- ous FAA personnel knew nothing.

Schuessler MUFON International Director Successful 2003 Symposium The MUFON 2003 International UFO Symposium, held July 4-6 at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Dearborn, MI, was a huge success. The speakers were professional with their presentations, and cordial with the audience. The hotel's meeting facilities were excellent, the food great, and the hotel site easy to access. Upon arrival we were treated to the sight of 600 antique Ford cars because their owners were attending the Ford anniversary event that week. All in all it was an excellent weekend. A hearty thank you and a round of ap- plause goes to MUFON State Director Richard McVannel and his symposium team. They made it all happen. MUFON Pandora Project In recent issues of the Journal 1 have talked about the MUFON Business Board decision to turn the many file cabinets of paper UFO reports into electronic reports. This has been a long-standing need, but the job is very large, and no one seemed to know how to get things un- derway until late last year when Colorado businessman and MUFON State Section Director James Carrion agreed to take the helm. The first thing he did was to define a project plan and present it to the Board. Then in the spring of 2003 he beta tested the plan using a set of the MUFON UFO report files. Because MUFON didn't have the resources to purchase the equipment necessary for the project. James loaned equipment to MUFON to get the project started. Then we needed a location to do all of the work, so Board Member Robert Simpson and Director of Membership Lin Simpson volunteered to host the project at their home in Parker, CO. The project, now known as the Pandora Project, offi- cially got underway on the first weekend in August with training of volunteers that will be doing the work. The Pandora Project is a huge under- taking for a volunteer staff, but it is im- portant to save this 34-year old historical database and to be able to make it avail- able electronically for future researchers. We would welcome financial help that would turn this into a fast track project by buying some additional equipment and paying the salaries of three or four people to do the work five or six days a week, rather than depending on volun- teers to do it on weekends in addition to their regular jobs. Please contact me at (303) 932-7709, or mufonhq@aol.com, or MUFON, P.O. Box 369, Morrison, Colorado 80465-0369 with suggestions or offers of financial help for the Pandora Project. We are already looking forward to Pandora Project II, where we plan to scan all past MUFON UFO Journals and MUFON Symposium Proceedings and make them available in electronic form. UFO Case Reports Needed MUFON receives notice of UFO re- ports by telephone and via WUFOD on the website at www.mufon.com on a daily basis. We depend on all of our great vol- unteers in the field to investigate and re- port on each of these incidents. One of the steps in the process is to send a copy of the report with support- ing data (maps, charts, drawings, news clippings, photos, etc.) to MUFON Head- quarters. These in turn go to the Journal and into the archives being turned into an electronic database by the Pandora Project. We are finding that many of the re- ports have not made it back to Headquar- ters from the field, and that will hurt the completeness of the electronic database until those reports are sent in to us. Everyone in MUFON has a hand in making the Pandora Project a success by going to their files and sending this material to us over the next several months. Our goal is for this to be the most comprehensive, current, and useful database available. MUFON Radio Program Another result of meetings in Dearborn during the recent symposium was a plan to inaugurate a weekly MUFON Radio Program. Board member Clifford Clift, working with MUFON Media Operations Special- ist Jim Hickman, formulated a plan for a weekly radio program to air starting the first Wednesday in September. I am scheduled to be the first program guest, setting the stage for MUFON state directors, state section directors, consult- ants, research specialists, field investiga- tors and more to bring the current state of UFO investigations and research to the attention of the public. New Lifetime Members It is a pleasure to announce that Doris Alvarez, Branford, CT; Dan Aykroyd, Los Angeles. CA; and Alexander Mebane, Venice, FL are MUFON's latest lifetime members. We are extremely grateful for this vote of confidence and outstanding level of support. Membership Fee Increase Meeting in Dearborn, MI, in July, the MUFON Business Board of Directors considered the continual increase in costs for postage, printing, purchase of wares, supplies, new initiatives, improvements to the MUFON UFO Journal, a forthcom- ing new and upgraded web site, and for general operations, and opted to increase the annual membership fee, rather than cutting services or quality. Therefore, effective Dec. 1, 2003, the cost of membership in the United States will be $45 per year and $55 per year out- side of the United States. Members will be allowed to renew early, before the Dec. 1 deadline, at the current rate for one, two or three years. Position Announcements Canadian National Director Eugene Prison has announced the formation of a Canadian Cases Investigation Committee, and will be providing the details of its operation for a future issue of the MUFON UFO Journal. To oversee the operations of the com- mittee, he has appointed Chris J. Styles as Canadian Director of Investigations. Chris was the MUFON Eastern Regional Director for Canada. Michael Bird, former Provincial Director for Ontario will replace Chris as Eastern Regional Director for Canada.
