They could have abducted us. They could have done anything they wanted to with us. \"It was about seven o'clock just after sunset. We never saw anything approaching. Suddenly a big disc-shaped object thirty meters in diameter and fifty meters high was hovering exactly above us! It made a noise like an air conditioner, and in the midst of that we could hear a sound like a bicycle sprocket when you pedal back- wards. \"It was emitting a yellow glow that would grow and dim, grow and dim, every two or three seconds... for about five times. As we watched we could see small yellow and orange lights in the middle of it. And after the fifth time, the lights turned light blue, dimmed-and then it disappeared with incredible speed toward the )> sea. The astonishing close encounter occurred near the village of Baia do Sol, about twenty five kilome- ters north of Belem, one night in November 1977 dur- ing a long series of UFO sightings in at least thirty villages at the mouth of the Amazon River. The sightings began in August 1977 and continued for more than a year. Hollanda said the chief of the Intelligence Service at the First Air Force Command in Belem sent him and a number of technicians, photographers and specialists, all sergeants, to the region to investigate. The team Spent four months in Colares, Baia do Sol and other villages just north of Belem, after which time the official investigation was terminated. However, Hollanda said, he wanted to leam more about the flying saucers and continued the investigation on his own for several more months. Still interested \"I was interested because I saw a lot of things,\" he explained. \"I continued searching for the reasons About the Authors Both Bob Pratt and Cynthia Luce have been investigat- ing the UFO phenomenon for more than 20 years. Cynthia has a master's degree in anthropology and has lived in Brazil for 25 years. During most of this time she has been a member and section director of MUFON. Bob has been a journalist for nearly 50 years, is a former editor of the MUFON UFO Journal, and is the author of UFO Danger Zone: Terror and Death in Brazil-What Next? He is also co-author with J. Allen Hynek and Philip J. Imbrogno of Night Siege: The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings. Pratt has in- terviewed an estimated 1,800 individuals in North and South America who have reported UFO experiences. Pratt and Luce have worked together in Brazil on several occasions, the first being in 1979. for what the UFOs were doing there, what they wanted... the Air Force was no longer interested but I was.\" Hollanda said he and the sergeants interviewed nearly three hundred people who had had close en- counters, including dozens of men and women who had been burned by the UFOs. At least two people died in Colares after being burned by rays from UFOs, according to Dr. Wellaide Cecim Carvalho, who was then in charge of the state- operated hospital in Colares. It is not known whether there were UFO-related deaths in any of the other vil- lages. Hollanda said he was not aware of the Colares deaths at that time but heard about them later. Dr. Wellaide also said she treated about forty people who had been burned by beams of red light from UFOs. Hollanda told us his team had seen almost the same number of injuries in Colares, but added that people had been similarly burned in many other vil- lages as well, including some on Marajo Island, sixty kilometers across the mouth of the Amazon from Colares. Beams of light Villagers in Colares reported that sometimes UFOs would hover in the dark sky at night and beam down rays of light, usually green or red, at houses - beams of light that passed through the tile roofs as if they didn't exist. At times the rays were seen circling around inside the houses as if searching for someone or something. Hollanda said the tiles seemed to dema- terialize where the rays hit them and then re-material- ized when the rays withdrew or shut off. The UFO beings used two different rays of light, Hollanda said. \"First came a green light that would hit the person and paralyze them, then the green light would turn off and a red ray of light would hit, burning them,\" he said. \"A lot of people were burned.\" One of the victims in Colares was Claudiomira Rodrigues Paixo, then thirty five. On the night of Oc-"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 April 1999 MUFON UFO Journal tober 18, 1977, she was asleep in a hammock at the home of a cousin and her five children. About eleven o'clock Claudiomira was awakened by a light coming through a window. \"The air became warmer and warmer,\" she told Hollanda. \"The first time the light was green. It touched my head and passed across my face. I woke up and the color changed to red.\" She could see a person, like a man in a diving suit, but only from the chest up. \"He had an instrument like a pistol,\" she said. Beam strikes her chest \"He pointed it at me and shined the beam three times, hitting me in the chest all three times almost in the same place. It was very hot. I got very thirsty. It hurt, like being stuck with a needle. I bled at all three points. I think each time he took blood. 1 was terrified, but I couldn't move my legs. I was paralyzed. I was very frightened.\" The \"man\" and the light disappeared when she began screaming, awakening her cousin, who took her to the hospital. Dr. Wellaide treated her, and Claudiomira returned home about four in the morning. The burns left three tiny pinpoint scars in a triangular pattern on the upper right side of her chest. \"For many weeks I had headaches and fever,\" Claudiomira said. In an interview in Belem in 1993, Dr. Wellaide said most of the burns she treated were like sunburns, usually on the chest and throat. \"I could see two small puncture wounds in the center of the burns,\" she said. \"All had irritation, swelling, redness. Very red. The burns usually covered an area of ten to twenty centi- meters, and the skin peeled off. These burns healed quickly. Usually it takes about seventy-two hours for burned skin to peel. UFO burns begin to peel almost immediately.\" In each case, she said, the victims told her a ray of light had hit them. Nearly all of the villagers were terrified because they believed they were under attack by the UFOs, and they had no way to defend themselves. Many fled from the area. Dr. Wellaide said that for three months everyone left Colares except her and two other residents, the sheriff and the priest (Fa- ther Alfredo de La 6, who experienced many sightings, according to Hollanda). They had little to eat except eggs and farinha because fishermen were too fright- ened to fish. Shoot at disks \"The villagers were very afraid,\" Hollanda said. \"They used weapons. They shot at the discs very of- ten, threw rocks. We told them: 'Don't shoot! Don't shoot! \"Once a strong light was focused on a man's home in Colares, a carpenter about fifty or sixty years old. He got a rifle and aimed at the disc. The light turned Cynthia Luce with A. J. Gevaerd, MUFON Director for Brazil (left), and UFO re- searcher Ubirajara Rodrigues (right). on him and he fell to the ground, almost paralyzed. He could barely move for fifteen days. The first day he was dizzy. He could hear, see, and speak but he stayed in his hammock for days, hardly able to move. After fifteen days he was normal again.\" Fishermen from Colares also saw UFOs going into and out of the water, and sometimes they saw blue lights moving around underwater. \"They told me about these sightings, but I did not believe them,\" Hollanda said. \"Once I was sleeping and the sergeants came and told me they had photographed a flying saucer diving into the water near a boat. I waited for the fisherman to come to shore and he told me that happened. He said he was afraid. Dives into water \"Several weeks later I saw a light near a fish- ing boat. The light was blue. It circled the boat once or twice about three hundred meters away and then it dived into the water. The boat was about eight hundred meters off shore. I could see the sail of the boat in the light from the UFO. I saw it. It really happened. I started to believe the fishermen were telling the truth. I asked the fishermen did it make a splash, a sound? No, noth- )) ing. Hollanda held his hand horizontally flat, then moved it down and said: \"When you hit the water that way, SPLAT! But when you do like this,\" and he turned hand vertically sideways, \"no sound, like a blade go- ing in water. I talked with another crew of fishermen who said they saw a blue light under water circle the boat and then come out of the water about a hundred meters away. We got a lot of reports from fishermen. More attacks \"I went over to Marajo Island three or four times to see what was happening there, and the people there were getting attacked too. Some of them said"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal April 1999 PageS they also saw flying saucers floating on the water, blue lights, and they could hear sounds like fishing nets be- ing launched and then pulled in. This was maybe eight hundred to a thousand meters offshore.\" The people called the UFOs chupa-chupas, Hollanda said, because they believed the UFOs suck blood from the victims. He was convinced that actu- ally happened, but he believed the UFO crews were simply taking blood samples, somehow withdrawing small amounts when they burned someone with a ray of red light. \"They were not attacking people,\" he said. \"They were collecting material.\" UFOs seen every night Flying saucers were seen throughout neighbor- ing Maranhao nearly every night from April through July in 1977, just before moving farther west to the Belem region. They then showed up in Colares in Au- gust, but Hollanda, then a captain, was not aware of them until the following month. \"1 was in Brasilia at the National Intelligence School, and when 1 returned to Belem, my section chief (Lt. Col. Camilo, then head of the Belem Air Force Base's Intelligence Service) asked me whether I be- lieved in UFOs. Until then, I didn't know about the operation in Colares. When he asked me that, I said 'Yes.' And he said, 'Well, you are responsible for the operation now.'\" Col. Camilo and several sergeants from the air base had already spent two to three weeks in Colares. They had interviewed some of the people who had been burned by UFOs and had seen flying saucers them- selves. Asked why Camilo chose him, Hollanda re- plied: \"I don't know. I was the chief of the Operation Section. I was responsible for the operations of the Intelligence Service. \"1 went to the commander of the base, the briga- dier, to find out what he wanted done. I asked him what the command wanted to know about the cases in Colares, what was the line of the investigation. He said he was interested in what was happening and wanted to know everything we could find out. He wanted us to get the details and make a report.\" No deadline The commander did not set any specific length of time for the investigation. Hollanda selected as his staff a number of sergeants who worked in Intelligence and had been trained in different specialties: photogra- phy, metallurgy, first aid, and so on. He equipped them with cameras, tape recorders, radios, food, and what- ever else they would need to spend time in the field, traveling to affected villages and interviewing the people. To Hollanda, this was just another Intelligence operation. He called it Operaqao Prato because, he said, he had to give the operation a name. \"Brazil is the only nation that calls UFOs 'discos voadores', fly- ing saucers,\" he explained. \"In Portugal, they speak Portuguese too and they call it 'flying plate.' The Span- ish call them 'platillos volantes' and the French call it flying saucer. I could not call it Operation Flying Sau- cer. I could not call it Operation Flying Disc. I chose a cousin of the saucer, a plate. That's why I called it Operacao Prato.\" Hollanda and his team soon went to Colares. \"I returned to Belem a week or two later and the com- mander asked me what I had seen. I told him I didn't know anything yet. My problem was that I saw lights almost every night, and we photographed them, but the negatives didn't show anything. I had no proof of the flying saucers, only my visual information.\" Moving from place to place Generally, the team would spend a week in one village or another-moving from Colares to Mosqueiro to Baia do Sol to Benevides, Santo Antonio do Taua, Vigia, Braganca and many other villages as well as farm areas-and return to Belem on weekends. They often saw flying saucers themselves and photographed many of them, then kept detailed notes and sketches on altitude, movement, direction, color, shape and any- thing else they believed important. In the daytime they would type up their reports. They interviewed people who had seen UFOs and been. burned by them, again keeping written records of what people told them. \"I was there with orders from my commander to see and try to understand what was hap- pening there,\" Hollanda said. \"We were to photograph everything we could. But I spent two months without any results. I saw the balls of light, I saw the people who had been burned, but I could not make any con- clusions. Many times during the two months, I saw very bright lights, blue lights, yellow lights, but I didn't see one object. I saw lights, but no shape. I was wor- ried because my work was showing no results. \"When we saw a big ball of light we photo- graphed it, but it did not register on the film. I was sure when I came back to headquarters that we had a pic- ture of a big light, but nothing showed on the nega- tives. Then I asked for filters and special film, infrared and ultraviolet. The results were much better, and then we identified many other forms, many other shapes.\" Once they started getting results, they were able to get good photos of UFOs. Three-hundred photos \"We took about three hundred photos and we photographed eight different shapes of UFOs,\" he said in an earlier, off-the-record interview. \"The first was a disc with windows. The second was rectangular, like a barrel on its side. The third was a trapezoid, or like a"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Page 6 April 1999 MUFON UFO Journal pyramid with its top cut off. The fourth was like a Boeing (jetliner). The fifth was triangular or like an arrowhead. They flew very high in the sky and very fast. They were also seen leaving the water. The sixth was domed. The seventh was pointed on the top and bottom and was black on top and white on the bottom. The eighth was like a ball with three sticks coming out the back, with lights on the sticks.\" A mother ship In Cabo Frio, Hollanda said they had actually seen a ninth shape-a huge mother ship. \"It was maybe a hundred meters long with windows in it. This was near Baia do Sol. And little ones (flying saucers) would come out of it and later go back in, three, four, five, six sometimes. We photographed this several nights.\" Hollanda said some people reported seeing occupants in the flying saucers. Usually most of them were short, about 1.50 meters. However, in two cases the beings were taller and looked more or less like nor- mal people. \"One man in Baia do Sol said he was sleep- ing after lunch when he awoke to see a red light blink- ing outside his house. He thought that was strange and went to the window, and what he saw was much stranger. It was a huge shape like a helicopter, but with- out rotors. A red light was blinking on top. There were three men inside. They were tall, about one meter eighty, with blond hair and blue eyes and were wearing white suits with blue capes. They looked like they were work- ing with instruments, like a computer. When the man appeared at the window, he heard one of the three say to the others: 'Look at that.' And immediately the UFO took off, disappearing beyond the trees.\" Tall blond man In another case, a pilot friend of Hollanda's was driving near Colares one night when he saw a light in the sky coming toward him. \"He stopped the car and he saw this disc land behind the trees. He was alone on the road, it was completely dark, and he became fright- ened. Then he saw a man walking toward him. The stranger was tall and had blond hair. He walked close to the car, looked at the driver, and looked into his eyes. The driver started to cry and the tall man shook his head, glanced at the license plate, turned, and walked back into the forest. Then the disc took off into the sky.\" Hollanda related a story about a young man named Luis who was hunting in the forest. Luis climbed a tree and slung a hammock to wait for small animals to come near. A bright light approached and stopped above him. Frightened, he jumped to the ground and tried to hide. He saw a door open on the bottom of the UFO and a little humanoid floated down a beam of light with his arms and legs spread out, and shined a red light over the hammock, then returned to the UFO in the same way. \"Luis began to run, but the forest was muddy,\" Hollanda said. \"He ran and ran and the disc chased him with the beam of light. It took him an hour to get to the place where two friends were waiting for him in a boat. They saw a big ball of light searching for them, and all three jumped into the water to hide in the weeds. Then the UFO stopped over the boat and again the little man came floating down like before and passed a red light over their boat, searching for something. Then the man went back to the flying saucer and it went away.\" (In the official report that was sent to the Bra- zilian Air Force Headquarters in Brasilia, the incident occurred on the evening of Nov. 11, 1977, and the hu- manoid was described as short but muscular and wear- ing a dark, seamless uniform, and that as Luis fled from the first encounter, he looked back and saw the hu- manoid examining his fishing net.) Back to the site Hollanda persuaded a reluctant Luis to take him and four sergeants back to where this happened. \"About eleven thirty, we saw a big ball of fire, dark yellow, about two kilometers down the Rio Guajara,\" Hollanda said. \"We took some photographs of it. Then, about eleven forty five, we saw the same ball of fire again, but this time it was smaller and going at a slower speed. Now it was only a thousand meters from us over on the right side of the river and maybe two hun- dred meters high. \"At midnight, a big ball of fire passed directly over us, going across the river. When it got to the other side, it turned its light out and we saw a disc-shaped object about twice as big as a Boeing 737, very, very big. It was amber colored with many bright white win- dows. When it passed over us, we heard a small noise like a turbine, but low. It crossed the river and disap- peared. We photographed this object also. \"Then, about two in the morning, we saw it again. This time it was coming down the right side of the river. It looped out and swung back toward us and stopped for a minute above the opposite shore. It looked like the sun had stopped about seventy meters away and six to eight meters high. It was a very, very big ball of bluish light. Photos show shape \"We were taking pictures all the time. Then the object went into the sky very fast and shut its light off. When it did that, we couldn't see the shape, but there was one green light on top and a red light on the bottom. We couldn't see the shape, but when the pic- tures were developed, we could see a large disc-shaped object standing vertically, rather than horizontally.\" Whenever possible, usually at the end of each week or two in the field, Hollanda turned in reports of"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal April 1999 Page? the team's findings. These reports gave details of each sighting of their own and those they learned about, the testimony of witnesses, and photos they took of UFOs. Also included would be sketches of the UFOs, as well as maps showing where sightings occurred and paths of the UFOs as they moved about. Officials reports Hollanda no longer remembered how many in- dividual cases he reported to Brasilia. Somehow, Bra- zilian UFO researchers obtained copies of many of the reports that had been sent to Brasilia, and we have seen at least three different sets, no two of which are identical. Some are bare summaries of incidents with dates and times but no names, while others name the witness and give date, time, location and details of the encounters. Some examples from one set of documents are: 1. \"A reddish-yellow light at low altitude mov- ing east to west descended rapidly toward the witness, obliging him to hide in the bushes from where he saw the object shine a blue light in his direction. He could not determine its size or shape. He heard a hissing sound like a dynamo when the object climbed toward the city.\" 2. \"A bright light hovering about twenty meters above the trees, bluish color with three black stripes, with a round shape like a farinha oven, lit up every- thing around it. The witness aimed a gun to shoot the object when he was hit by a reddish light that felt like an electrical charge, paralyzing him. Thereupon the object moved off, gaining altitude in a wavy motion and spinning like a wheel while making a slight hiss- ing sound.\" 3. \"A ball of light, yellow-reddish, moved down to a low height, ten meters, east to west, circular shape with a multi-colored tail, making no sound, emitted a long ray of bluish light that hit the witness in the back, causing numbness in the area hit and paralysis, muscle pain and other effects for several days.\" 4. \"A reddish-yellow light descended to one hundred meters, moving north-south... At a distance its light was very bright and when it came close it re- duced the intensity of the light, like a lighted cigarette in the dark. After coming to a swift stop, the object fired three quick rays of bluish light toward the city (Colares), 1,500 meters away. Witness raised his gun and fired two shots at the UFO.\" Additional reports And from another, more detailed set of docu- ments, a copy of which we showed to Hollanda (\"These are my reports,\" he said), these examples: 1. \"About 11:30 on the night of October 12, 1977, in the village of Santo Antonio de Taua, a twenty- year-old man named Manoel was standing outside his house with four friends. They saw a yellow light mov- ing east to west, then slow down and stop about twenty meters from them. Inside the object they could see a man on the left and a woman on the right who appeared to be working controls of some kind. Then a beam of red light was directed toward the group, hitting Manoel. It was like an electrical shock that traveled all over his body from the head to his toes. He felt weak and para- lyzed, and thought that for some minutes he was going to faint.\" 2. \"Late on the same night in the same village, a forty-year-old man (also) named Manoel was asleep in his house with his children when a bright light came through the roof, awakening him. He started to get up, but felt paralyzed. He tried to scream for help, but couldn't. After about two minutes he was able to get up and cry out. His neighbors came to his rescue. In telling the investigators his story, Manoel said his left side was numb for eight days. He said he had seen a ball of light several times passing near his home at low level without making any noise, at times slowing down and nearly stopping before disappearing at great speed. Like being stuck by a needle 3. \"At four o'clock in the morning on October 26,1977, in the same village, a thirty-six-year old man named Raimundo was awakened by a bright greenish glow in his room. Then he felt as if he had been stuck by a needle on the inside of his right thigh. He felt dizzy and soon had a headache. His thigh was reddish and hot. Several other people had told him the same thing had happened to them, but he didn't believe them. Ten days later, his thigh looked like it had been sun- burned. The whole area was twenty-five centimeters long and fourteen wide, oval shaped. In the center was a small red point, and around that was a two-centime- ter area that was clearer where the skin was starting to peel.\" These incidents are just a few of the many hun- dreds that occurred throughout the region. Hollanda's team obviously could not investigate and record ev- erything that happened in that area during 1977-78, especially after the Air Force ended the official phase of the investigation. Hollanda turned all of his reports in to his superiors, and the reports were then sent to Brasilia. \"I never saw them again,\" he said. \"Did anybody from Brasilia ever ask you any questions about these reports?\" we asked. \"No, I asked them, and they said, 'We are keeping them indefi- nitely.'\" \"But nobody asked questions about what you found up there?\" \"No, they joked,\" Hollanda replied. Not all of his colleagues took his investigation seri- ously. \"Some of my fellow officers used to joke with me and asked if I had seen any flying saucers. But later some of them saw the same thing.\" Hollanda's investigation was not a secret mis-"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PageS April 1999 MUFON UFO Journal sion, but it was \"classified,\" he said. \"The Brazilian government and the Air Force were not interested in publicizing UFOs because three questions were often asked of the Government and the Air Force: Who are they? Where do they come from? What do they want? And the Air Force did not have answers to the three questions.\" Ordered to keep quiet Asked if his commander had specifically told him he could not speak publicly about the sightings, Hollanda replied: \"Yes.\" We asked if the Air Force ever had any similar UFO investigations in other parts of the country. \"No,\" Hollanda answered, and then said his investigation was unique for three reasons: \"We were lucky we had a very long exposure to the UFO phenomenon. We were lucky because we were chosen to be in charge of the operation. And we were lucky because my commander, the brigadier, was interested and believed in UFOs. Three conditions. It would be very difficult to have all three again.\" We asked if he had ever worked with the U.S. Air Force, and again he said \"No\" but added: \"They were interested, but we never worked together. They asked about the UFO operation, but we never worked together. They wanted to know what we saw, the facts.\" He explained that two or three times military attaches from the American embassy in Brasilia would pass through Belem. They would have lunch or drinks to- gether and the subject would come up. \"It was very discreet,\" Hollanda said. \"I suppose it was just curios- ity, or they dissimulated very good.\" We asked if at any time his commander considerd sending fighter planes after the UFOs, and he said: \"No.\" Nor did he and his sergeants ever think of shooting at the UFOs. \"We never, in the entire time of the mission, used a single weapon, never even thought of doing it,\" he said. A widespread flap The 1977-78 Colares-area UFO flap was not an isolated occurrence, in Hollanda's opinion. He was convinced that the UFOs \"surveyed\" much of north- em Brazil in 1977-78. A smaller flap, lasting for four months, had taken place just to the east in the state of Maranhao in mid-1977. When the Maranhao flap ended, the flying saucers shifted operations west and next showed up in the Colares region. \"They were covering Brazilian air space in strips much the way aerial photographers would,\" Hollanda said. \"They were moving from Maranhao, then to Colares, Marajo, Monte Alegre, Santarem and Manaus, covering the region like a program.\" Where the flying saucers were before they in- vaded Maranhao, or where they went after leaving the Manaus area, no one knows, although some encoun- ters were reported in Ceara and Rio Grande do Norte in 1977. The year 1977 was a particularly active one for UFOs throughout South America and the rest of the world... and they have never gone away. Sightings and encounters still occur nearly every day somewhere, not only in Brazil, but around the globe. Hollanda, who died unexpectedly on Oct. 2, 1997, at the age of fifty seven, spent thirty-six years in the Air Force. He enlisted at the age of 17 and spent the next seven years undergoing academic and mili- tary training at the Air Force academy. He became flu- ent in English and French, was a pilot, a parachutist, a jungle expert, and for many years was the finance of- ficer of the Belem Air Force Base-and for twenty-four years was an officer in the secret Intelligence Service, a fact that few people were aware of. Hollanda said he had Indian, Portuguese, Jew- ish, French and Dutch blood in him, and was proud of the fact that one of his great-great-grandmothers was indian and a member of a cannibal tribe called Porintintin. He knew some indian dialects (\"They would greet me saying, 'Capitao! Capitao!'\"hesaidin Cabo Frio), and almost every month for six years he spent long periods of time living in the jungle and work- ing with tribal indians, who are under the protection of the government. He retired from the Air Force on March 10, 1992. A unique individual Our friend Hollanda was a unique individual, a well-trained, highly educated professional warrior who served his country loyally and well. As long as he was on active duty he obeyed orders not to speak pub- licly about what he learned during his UFO investiga- tions. But in the year before he died, he concluded he was no longer obligated to. keep quiet. Thus, he began to speak out, giving interviews to magazine and televi- sion reporters, revealing with his firsthand testimony what governments around the world deny-that UFOs are very real. Many mysteries still surround Hollanda and his life. He had much more to tell. We have no doubt that he would fervently hope that others with secret knowl- edge of flying saucers will follow his example and speak out. For those who knew him well, it is hard to imag- ine him gone, and even more impossible to forget him."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal April 1999 Page 9 Military interrogation sessions with alleged abductees By Helmut Lammer Ph.D. Since I published two overview articles on al- leged military involvement in alien abductions (MILABs), most of the well known alien abduction researchers stayed quiet, but interestingly the abductees did not. I got much information and new MILAB cases which were investigated by professional psychiatrists and therapists, and which have not published books on the abduction phenomenon. This information and the growing evidence that covert military-intelligence agencies may be secretly involved in the alien abduction phenomenon led to three books about alien abductions, former mind-control experiments, and exotic weapon technologies, co- authored by my wife. Two of them are available only in Europe, but one of them, which concentrates mainly on the MILAB topic, will be available in the USA via lllumiNet Press this month. This book has the title MILABS: Military Mind-Control and Alien Abduction and will be the first publication which describes in de- tail this frightening but interesting aspect of the alien abduction phenomenon. Of course there are MILAB sceptics too. Most of them have military-intelligence backgrounds and believe that it is not possible that covert military agen- cies kidnap, examine, and interrogate innocent people in democratic countries like the USA or Canada, people which they have sworn to defend. Recently declassified top secret cold war ra- diation experiments, covert biowarfare experiments, il- legal drug tests on unwitting people and former mind- control projects like BLUEBIRD, ARTICHOKE, MKULTRA, MKSEARCH,... show that some people high up in the command chain may have other views of how they defend their own people. Other MILAB sceptics, like well known alien abduction researcher Prof. David Jacobs, try to defend their so-called abduction-world-view, their patriotic belief in their country, especially their belief in the mili- tary forces, with strange MILAB hypotheses. Aliens dressed as military? Prof. Jacobs wrote in his new book The Threat that he believes that MILAB abductees mistake hu- man-like alien/hybrids dressed in military-like clothes and uniforms for US military personnel. Further he be- lieves that these alien/hybrids bring the abductees to abandoned military bases, or even to unused areas of active military bases where they examine and interro- gate them. Therefore, Prof. Jacobs claims that there is no About the Author Dr. Lammer has a Ph.D. in Geophysics and works at the Austrian Space Research Institute as a planetary scientist on various space projects. He published many scientific papers in prestigious scientific journals such as the Journal of Geo- physical Research, Geophysical Research Letters, or Planetary and Space Science. He is a member of the European Geophysi- cal Socieiy (EGS) and the New York Academy of Sciences. Dr. Lammer researches UFO and related phenomena during his free time and has written several articles and four books related to the topic, which are translated in many Euro- pean countries and Japan. His fifth book, MILABS: Military Mind-Control and Alien Abductions, will be available in the USA via lllumiNet Press this month. He is the Austrian representative for the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) and an associate member of the Society for Scientific Exploration (SSE). His German language books include UFO Geheimhaltung (UFO Secrecy), Herbig Munich, 1995; UFO Nahbegegnungen (UFO Close Encounters), Herbig Munich, 1996; Verdeckte Operationen (Covert Operations), Herbig Munich, 1997; and Schwarze Forschungen (Black Research), Herbig Munich, 1999. evidence that the US Government, or any foreign mili- tary is involved in covert abduction projects. I believe that such claims of infiltrated military-like alien/hybrids, however, have no scientific credibility and will be used by debunkers for ridiculing the whole alien abduction phenomenon. In the 1998 MUFON Symposium Proceedings he claims further that only abductees which are not well known in the public claim that they have these frightening military contacts. This is also not true, since I would not know that MILAB cases exist if there were not well known abductees like Debby Jordan, Leah Haley, Katharina Wilson, Anna Jamerson, and Dr. Karla Turner, who have written books where they-described some of their MILAB experiences. Credit the abductees In fact the abductees are the ones who brought the MILAB topic out to the public, and not the well known alien abduction researchers! When I write about the military, I do not mean the whole US military community; I mean only a small covert task force which is in the need to know and operates in an Unacknowledged Special Access Pro- gram (USAP), financed by a black budget. Therefore, I am not against the whole US mili- tary and related agencies, but I think that the public has the right to know what is going on in USAPs, where the enemy seems not to be a hostile dictator or regime. If one reviews hypnosis transcripts of several MILAB abductees and compares their recovered memories with the experiences of survivors of now known declassi- fied Government sponsored mind-or behavior-control experiments, one will find a strong indication that co-"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Page 10 April 1999 MUFON UFO Journal vert human military personnel are indeed involved in the alien abduction phenomenon. Many researchers ignore or don't understand MILAB experiences be- cause they don't know good and competently investi- gated MILAB cases. Support from MUFON project It should be noted that cases in MUFON's own Abduction Transcription Project support the MILAB hypothesis. Dan Wright informed me on May 5,1998, that the experiences recalled by several subjects of project MILAB bear striking resemblance to those separately recalled by persons in the MUFON Abduc- tion Transcription Project. Examples are: 1. A hangar with UFO-like craft(s) 2. One or more cubicle-like rooms within a very large underground room or cavern. 3. Military officers with name tags and other identifi- ers removed from their uniforms. 4. Use of drugs to elicit responses from subjects. 5. Berating the subject to relate what he/she was told or shown by aliens. 6. Brainwashing the subject to believe afterward that the interrogation did not happen. We found in our research that most MILAB abductees claim with or without hypnosis that they were interrogated by military personnel, men in business suits, or men in white lab-coats sometime during their experience. Brenda (pseudonym) a Canadian alien abductee who was also taken to a military base during one of her encounters remembers the following:[l] \"...I was in front of a military hangar. I recall being met by two men in white lab-coats. I was led through a door where 1 saw a large room. As I was taken-down the hall, to my left on the wall was a large sign that read 'Cold City in the Future.' As I proceeded down the hall with these two men I saw a large UFO- like craft, but I could not focus. A room within a room \"Then I was taken to a room within a room where I was interrogated by two more men in white lab-coats. These two men were not young men they must have been in their fifties or so. One man stood behind me while the other stood in front. I was shoved against the wall while they talked to me. \"I remember standing there scared to death and I asked them if they were going to kill me. I recall one of them saying, 'We could, but we won't.' It was then that they pushed me forward while the one stood be- hind me. \"I noticed one guy held a bottle of what I saw to be chloroform. It was written on the bottle. Then the other had a cloth. One of the men stood behind me while the other guy put the stuff on the cloth. They placed this cloth over my mouth and that's the last thing I recall until I woke up in my room at home. The first thing I noticed was I could not see very well. My room was very hazy and my eyes were blurry. I was not feel- ing well at this time. I had a very bad headache and an upset stomach. I could smell chloroform in my nose and was sick for most of that day.\" Similar report Debby Jordan, like Brenda, also remembered that she saw many rooms within a room, each sepa- rated by glass walls and more wide swinging doors.[2] The military hangar and the strange looking UFO-like craft offers evidence that Brenda was taken to a secret military/aerospace facility. The craft must not be an alien UFO; it could also be that she saw an advanced disc shaped, UFO-like drone, such as the discs which are currently developed at Lockheed's Helendale un- derground research facility near Palmdale in South California. MILAB abductee and researcher Melinda Leslie had also experienced alien and military abduc- tions since 1993. One of those kidnappings occurred near one of the before mentioned secret aerospace fa- cilities in southern California, where she had an alien abduction experience near Lancaster with friends. After some weeks they independently had flashbacks of a scenario where they saw a man in a Navy uniform monitoring their examination, which was done by nonhuman beings. They remember also that they had headphone-like things on their head.[3] Kidnapped and drugged In November 1993 Ms. Leslie remembered that she was kidnapped, drugged, and taken by two men in camouflage to a military facility where she saw also a strange triangle-shaped craft in a large hangar. In the meantime she has done extensive hypnosis regression concerning this event.[4] She recalled being on a stretcher in a large hangar as a helicopter pilot asked her what the hell she is doing there. At that moment a man in a naval officer uniform and two men in white"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal April 1999 Page 11 lab-coats appeared and rebuked the pilot. This important event shows that not all mili- tary personnel on this base had the \"need to know\" concerning MILABs. After this confrontation the men in the lab-coats and the military guy took her in an interrogation room. She described in detail how they walked through halls with video cameras on the walls and metal-doors. Inside this room was a table and chairs. Forced to sit on chair Melinda was forced to sit on such a chair, and one man in a lab-coat gave her a shot in the arm and a strange drink. After this she felt high. She was very frightened as she felt that one man grasped her on the cheeks. A man in a white lab-coat stood behind her and a spotlight shone on her chair. A red haired military officer asked her ques- tions concerning her alleged alien experiences. I do not believe that the alien/hybrids in military uniforms described by Dr. Jacobs would be interested in the abduction experience of humans which were allegedly done by the creators of the hybrids! This would be very strange, since the alien/hybrids should know more about the motives of the alleged alien abductors than the abductees. Strangly, it appeared that he wanted informa- tion about UFO technology. He said to her: [4] \"...What have they asked you? Tell me about their tech- nology? Tell me about the drive system, the drive mechanism? You tell me about what they told you to do! What did they tell you? What did they ask you to do? Tell me, tell me, tell me. You know you are not theirs, you are ours!...\" Very traumatic This strange interrogation session was very traumatic for her since she cannot recall that she an- swered his questions. The hypnotherapist calmed her as she began weeping and crying. After this interroga- tion she was brainwashed by the same guy:[4] \"...You couldn't tell me now even if you want. You can't talk right now. You couldn't tell it even if you try. We fixed that. Don't try! You won't remember any of this, we fixed it!...You won't remember this! It's a bad dream. We are taking care of that. You will not remember. This is a bad dream. You were never here...I don't exist...None of this is happening...\" Melinda Leslie tried to resist the brainwashing procedure, although she was drugged. Historic cases of mind-control experiments document procedures similar to Melinda Leslie's interrogation scenario. Master Sergant James Stanley was used in a psychochemical warfare experiment in Fort Knox, Kentucky, in February 1958. Stanley remembered sit- ting across a table from a white-coated doctor with two glasses of clear liquid between them. The man in the lab-coat said to him: \"Here, have a drink. It's only water, nothing more than what I drink.\" A little bit later, Stanley thought he had gone insane. His head was filled with terrifying visions and his body seemed to tumble through time and space. He participated un- wittingly in LSD-brainwashing experiments. After a third experiment Stanley's memory was wiped out and he vaguely remembered telling the doctor that he was standing by a river.[5] Drugs as Cold War weapon It is now known from the Edge wood experi- ments that the CIA and the military intelligence thought psychochemicals could be used as a cold war weapon to control the mind of an individual being interro- gated. [6] This short excursion into the CIA/LSD-brain- washing experiments of the fifties show that similar psychochemicals are probably used also in MILAB interrogation sessions. After the interrogation, Melinda Leslie was es- corted by military personnel through hallways and doors back to the hangar where she saw large dark unmarked helicopters. Melinda Leslie saw also an advanced tri- angle shaped UFO-like craft. One can speculate that she was taken to a similar base as Brenda. It should be noted, however, that she remembered many more de- tails of the base than I presented here. Abductee Leah Healy recalled, also under hyp- nosis, that she was taken by a helicopter to a military base where she was interrogated concerning her al- leged alien abduction experiences: [7,8] \"...I was struggling with them as I was coming off the helicopter. I don't understand why they're tak- ing me in there. I felt a sudden chill. It's cold. There's a man on each side of me holding my arms tightly. They're taking me into a building...! see men seated along the left side of a conference room table. The man in the blue uniform is standing to my right. Military pins \"A man decorated with military pins is stand- ing at the opposite end of the table. ..Somebody is giv- ing me a shot in the right arm. It feels like a tetanus shot...The guys in the uniform are still holding me tightly...They look like military people...Real short hair...They don't look familiar...They force me into a chair...! am just feeling dizzy...The man from the heli- copter said: 'Here she is. She's a cocky little bitch.' \"Then somebody on the other side of the room said, 'Well, we'll just take care of that!'...Somebody came up from behind me and put a jacket around my shoul- ders...\" Interestingly, abductee Leah Haley recalled a similar brain washing scenario as Melinda Leslie. She also has no memory what they asked her before."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Page 12 April 1999 MUFON UFO Journal \"...There's a man talking to me. He is telling me I haven't seen anything. He is not very nice. I don't see him because I am so dizzy. I'm leaning my head over. First he was on the other side of the room, but now he comes close to me and sort of props himself up against the table. He said. 'You didn't see a spaceship. Do you understand! You didn't see a spaceship'...They are angry...'It's none of your damned business...You hadn't seen anything...You don't know anything'... There is a lady with a blue uniform in the room. She brought in a tape recorder. She laid it on the end of the table at the other end of the room...\" Similar cases The husband of the late Dr. Karla Turner, Casey Turner, and many other MILAB abductees also recalled abductions where they were drugged, taken to a mili- tary underground facility, and interrogated by a mili- tary officer. There are more cases which describe such scenarios in detail in our book MILABS. If one investigates these so-called military in- terrogation sessions, it appears that these abductees are some kind of \"hypnotic couriers\" or programmed agents. In MILABS we show that professional hypno- sis experts like Dr. George Estabrooks claimed that they created such hypnotic couriers after the war via personality dissociation. [9] Probably a military psychia- trist split the personality of some abductees with known mind-control techniques such as sensory deprivation, spin-programming, flashlights, electric shocks, rape, ecetera to create \"Manchurian Candidates\" for infor- mation gathering purposes during alien abduction ex- periences. Personality split Consider the splitting of an abductee into per- sonality A and personality B. Personality A had been a normal citizen with alien abduction experiences. Un- der hypnosis, the abductee and especially personality B was carefully prepared for spying during an alien abduction experience. Personality B, the prepared mili- tary spy and deeper personality, knew all the thoughts of personality A. A military psychiatrist could hypnotize the whole person, to get in touch with personality B, the arificially created military spy. The military would have a straight perfect pipeline into the alien abduction sce- nario. Personality B is more watchful, has an enhanced memory, not so frightend as personality A. Since the military gave the abductees strange drinks and shots before the interrogation, they prob- ably use drugs to get easier access to personality B. When personality A is questioned the abductee would have no conscious memory of what happend during the interrogation session, since the civilian hypnotist does not know how person B could be triggered. There- fore, civilian researchers would have no way to get the information the military gets from personality B. Can't remember Another indication that the above mentioned scenario goes on is the fact that the interrogated abductee can't remember what he/she replies to the interrogator. Most remember some of the questions, but not the answers. Melinda Leslie found this experi- ence very frustrating. If MILAB abductees are programmed to spy for the military, the victim switches from personality B to personality A and understands only some of the ques- tions the interrogator asks them. As a consequence they would have memory gaps. MILAB abductee Lisa (pseudonym) was also interrogated by her military kidnappers. [ 10,11 ] On one August night in 1993, Lisa had an alien encounter, only to be followed the next night by a military kidnapping. The first night Lisa had what she called a reality-like dream of travelling in a spaceship with a Grey alien. The being was telepathically instructing her how to maneuver around objects. The Grey told her that the craft could sense objects and maneuver around them. The following night Lisa had a traumatic flash- back that she experienced as:[10, 11] \"...I was being interrogated by the military and pushed around. I was on the ground with my hands on the back of my head, with a gun pushing and holding me down. Men in green military clothes were asking me questions, while men in black military clothes were standing in the back- ground by the military vehicles. They kept saying over and over, to give them the knowledge, and they said at any cost...do you understand? At any cost!...\" After this Lisa's memory ended, and she wrote in her journal that she couldn't figure out what it was the military men wanted to know. On Dec. 17, she re- membered lying on a stretcher and being pushed down a hallway that was lit with bright lights. Something was inserted into her left ear, and she passed out. She remembered also men wearing business suits. One of these men called her by her maiden name. More flashbacks After some time she got more flashbacks of what occurred during this encounter:[10, 11] \"...All of a sudden I'm surrounded by men in black clothes and some military men dressed in green.\" Lisa was forced to walk very quickly across the grounds of a compound or an installation...\"The soldiers were rude to me...I told them to stop pushing on me. I was very irritated by them. Then we went into an office of some type...A man was sitting behind the desk. He was wearing solid green military type clothes, but had no name or tag medals on it. He started asking me ques- tions about what I felt about the aliens. It seemed like"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal April 1999 Page 13 he was wondering how to get the public prepared. I told him that a lot of the public was already aware, and some would never ac- cept it...\" During another military interrogation she met the same man as before. He told her that she was the key to understanding. \"...He was saying it's in my head and it had to be unlocked, and that I belong to the Gov- ernment. Also, men in green military clothes were stand- ing beside me with guns, and I thought there were some men in black uniforms behind me. I remember standing up and then being made to sit in an old wooden chair in a concrete-floored room. He wore green miltary clothes and kept tap- ping me with his fingers on the front and sides of my head, like he was frustrated with me...\" • Again the sentence: \"It's in your head, and it had to be unlocked\" points to a hypnoprogrammed courier or spy. We present more evidence in our MI LABS book that such things are going on, and there are more abductees who may have such a dissociative-program- ming. Manchurian candidate? If one speculates that MILAB abductees have got a \"Manchurian Candidate\"-like programming in their past, their personality A would have a \"missing time\" experience if personality B is activated, since A doesn't know what personality B was doing. Personal- ity B is probably trained on a military base for a secret mission. After some time, personality A could experi- ence flashbacks from personality B's memories. The military could defend personality B's memories by alien related screen memories and mostly personality A ex- perienced alien-related flashbacks. The before mentioned scenario is just a thought-game, but there are many indications that something similar is going on with some MILAB abductees. The before mentioned cases have similari- ties with cases from the files of hypnotherapist Valery Wolf, who testified with two former mind-control vic- X-ray from New Zealand mind-control victim Janine Jones. Mrs. Jones has statements from medical doctors confirming that she has a foreign object in her forehead which was implanted transnasal by per- sons unknown. The case has nothing to do with alien abductions, but one can see the similarities. (Copyright janine Jones.) tims before the radiation hearings of the US Congress, found indications that children who were abused and formed an ability to dissociate and split their person- alities were allegedly used by secret military/intelli- gence units for spy-purposes.[12] We asked several MILAB abductees 20 symp- toms which were found by people who switch into an- other personality, shortly before or after the transfor- mation. [ 13] These symptoms are: 1. A severe headache 2. Eye pressure 3. Pressure inside the head 4. Stiff neck and tense muscles 5. Blurry vision 6. Glassy eyes 7. Dizzy or lightheaded 8. Ringing in ears 9. Eyes become very sensitive to light 10. Chills 11. Feeling physically different 12. Feeling more childlike 13. A rapid mood swing   * 14. Thought's feelings and emotions change about the same situation"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Page 14 April 1999 MUFON UFO Journal 15. Things look different 16. You don't feel real. Like you are looking down on yourself 17. Your mannerisms change 18. Can't think clearly 19. Thought's get louder 20. Opposing conversations in your head (Voices) Many symptoms Interestingly most MILAB abductees reported many symptoms after an experience. Brenda experi- enced 14 symptoms, some of them very intensive. Katharina Wilson experienced 12 symptoms after or before an alleged alien abduction experience, and 15 symptoms after or before a MILAB experience. Michelle experienced 17 symptoms reported usually in multible personality patients. Other MILAB abductees from our review reported symptoms in the same numbers.[14] This results show probably a connection in MILABs, alien abductions, and multiple personality dis- order (MPD). More research must be done before we would definitively know what's really going on. Sev- eral mind-control research organisations and research- ers have collected a lot of evidence that the post war experiments which are now known to the public are only the tip of an iceberg. Dr. Corydon Hammond gave an interesting talk about \"Hypnosis in MPD: Ritual Abuse,\" at the Fourth Annual Eastern Regional Conference on Abuse and Multiple personality, 1992 in Virginia.[15] He re- ported that he and other therapists came across some cases where the abused victim claims that he/she were programmed by secret military/intelligence agencies in military hospitals. Naked on a gurney Basically, in the programming the victims will be put naked on a gurney. They will have an IV in one hand or arm. There are wires attached to their head to monitor electroencephalograph (EEG) patterns. Some victims describe pulsed flashing red, white or blue lights. They are drugged, probably with Demerol or other drugs. Dr. Hammond believes that military psy- chiatrists need no longer than 25 minutes to program a person. Some of Dr. Hammond's patients describe a pain in one ear, mostly the right ear. They hear weird disorienting sounds in that ear while they see photic stimulation to drive the brain into a brainwave pattern with a pulsing light at a certain frequency. After a cer- tain period the victim is in the right brainwave state and they will begin with the programming. Many MILAB abductees describe IV's, drugs, pulsing lights, implants,...therefore, it seems to me that they have received some programming during MILAB kidnappings. It is difficult to say what MILAB abductees are being conditioned or programmed to do. By care- ful investigation of these interrogation sessions one should ask two questions: 1. Are MILAB abductees military programmed \"Manchurian Canditates\" who spy for a secret mili- tary task force in alleged alien crafts? Are they so-called \"Trojan Horses\" inside \"real\" UFOs during an alien abduction experience? Or... 2. Is their alien abduction experience a syn- thetically programmed screen memory for hiding se- cret spy or military missions? Detailed research in the history of MILAB abductees should lead to answering at least question (2). If one finds that the parents or relatives of the vic- tim had early connections to the military/intelligence community, they were adopted or worked early on sen- sitive Government positions, one should find some evidence of childhood mind-control programming. Covert operations We believe that there are also indications that \"some\" MILAB experiences show that there is indeed at least one covertly operating secret military task force whose leaders \"believe\" some alien abductions may be real. Therefore, they seem to be interested in get- ting as much infomation from alleged alien abductees . as they can. It should also be noted that the above mentioned MILAB abductees are not alone, and that their cases are only examples from a much larger pool of victims.

Lammer and Marion Lammer, llluminetpress, 1999. Reviewed by Dwight Connelly This, Dr. Lammer's fifth book, could change the way many people view the UFO phenomenon. Evidence is presented by this international researcher that the military is involved with what we normally perceive as purely alien abductions, suggesting that the motive for this involve- ment may be two-fold: (1) find- ing out more about the true alien abductions and (2) utilizing fake alien abductions in order to conduct experiments on hu- man guinea pigs. Such experi- ments, he suggests, are in two specific areas: (1) advanced mind and behavior con- trol, and (2) genetic research. Dr. Lammer goes into considerable detail, with extensive footnoting, as he develops this theory. Whether one accepts his conclusions or not, the reader at least knows what they are based on. There are many noteworthy chapters in this book, and there is space to briefly touch on just a few. For example, the chapter on the role of dark, unmarked helicopters in conjunction with abductions is quite interesting. The author notes that this is pri- marily reported in the U.S., rather than worldwide, sug- gesting that such encounters and observations are more likely to involve the U.S. military than aliens. Reports by abductees of what appears to be involvement with the military during abductions is, of course, discussed in detail. Rather than accepting the presence of the military and individuals in lab coats as a technique used by aliens to screen or confuse abductees, Dr. Lammer takes the approach that it may very well work the other way around: the military (gov- ernment) is utilizing-the perceived (perhaps faked) alien presence in some abductions to confuse the situation and to damage the credibility of military abductees. The author discusses the role of drugs, such as LSD, as possible components of military abductions, noting experiments which show that such drugs can create hallucinations and otherwise make the victims see strange beings, strange animals, and other images often reported by abductees. Another fascinating area involves scientific ex- periments which involve living organisms, including dogs, being submerged in a liquid and being able to actually survive by breathing the liquid and obtaining oxygen from it. One of the familiar reports of abductees, of course, involves submersion in a liquid in some sort of glass-like tube—and of observing oth- ers in similar tubes. Dr. Lammer theorizes that the military has simply carried the reported scientific ex- periments a step or two farther, utilizing unwilling abductees for their experiments. Likewise, he feels that cloning has been car- ried much farther than Dolly the sheep, and that re- ports by some abductees, such as Katharina Wilson, that they saw clones of themselves may very well be true. Another area being pursued openly by scien- tists involves the use of implants, and many abductees have indicated that their captors-whether alien or mili- tary- have also shown interest in such devices. While public discussion of implants focuses on their benefits, such as monitoring individuals to prevent heart attacks, or locating missing children or pets, Dr. Lammer has found evidence that others have a less benevolent pur- pose in mind. These would include manipulation of the thought process in humans, as well as implants for strategic military purposes. Again, Dr. Lammer ques- tions whether abductees have become unwilling par- ticipants in experiments which could not be conducted openly on humans, using fake alien abductions as a type of screen. There is, of course, a great deal more in this book that this brief review can cover. Dr. Lammer has done a tremendous amount of research, and has been able to bring his research together in a compelling ac- count. This is one of those books that is truly hard to put down. While Dr. Lammer's account will not be the last word on MILABS, it appears to be the best thus far, and ufologists will not have a picture of the total abduction situation without reading it.

P. Daley is very interesting, but raises the question who is kidding who. In the answer to Question 1 regarding \"the elements that have closed shells, e.g. 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, and 126,\" anyone with a chemistry or physics background will do a double take. This could be a typographical error if one or two numbers were incorrect; however, only helium with atomic number 2 is accurate. The remaining ele- ments with closed shells are neon # 10, argon # 18, kryp- ton #36, xenon #54, and radon #86. The theoretical . element at #126 may or may not be stable if it is ca- pable of being created. Please clarify this apparent er- ror. Jerry Pirie Creston, B.C., Canada Mr. Pirie's letter was referred to MUFON Consultant Bob Wood. His response follows: I received today your note and letter from Mr. Pirie of Canada regarding the possible errors in the Daly article in the February \\999Joumal. Daley is attempting to discuss the stability of the nuclei of the atoms and is, by inference, using a model of how the protons and neutrons of the nuclei may be arranged in shells. Unfortunately, he used the words \"closed atomic shells,\" which conjures up the image of the elec- trons going around the nuclei and the attendant chemi- cal stability properties. The closed atomic (electron) shells are shown on the right-hand row of any periodic table, and are given with their atomic numbers: 2. He helium, 10 Ne neon, 18 Ar argon, 36 Kr krypton, 54 Xe xenon, and 86 Rn radon, just as Pirie notes. These elements are the inert gases, basically irrelevant to the point Mr. Daley is trying to make. The stability of the nucleus is what is at issue, and the stable low atomic number elements have equal numbers of neutrons and protons. If heavier elements are examined, to be stable the number of neutrons ex- ceeds that of the protons. For example, stable nickel (Ni) with atomic number 28 has 30 neutrons for the most abundant isotope. Nickel also has an isotope with 32 neutrons that is stable. I do not have handy the Meyerhotf reference cited by Daley and have no way of developing his se- quence of closed (nuclear) shell stability of 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82 and 126, and whether the number represent protons or neutrons. I presume protons, since he al- ludes to \"element 126.\" Thus, I cannot confirm this sequence of \"closed shells\" in the article or describe how they may have been obtained. They may indeed be incorrect, but I think Daley will have a good an- swer, which will become much more complex than implied. It is unfortunate that the word \"isotope\" was misspelled \"isotone\" on line 6 following the Question 1 header, since the entire discussion hinges on an un- derstanding of isotopes, and it is easy to see how Pirie missed this point. I believe his concern was somewhat justified. UFO flap reported in Lima, Peru, area By George Filer MUFON Eastern Director LIMA -On Feb. 9,1999, just before midnight, witnesses from the port of Pisco, 300 kilometers south of Lima, watched a large anomalous light emerge from the Pacific Ocean. The UFO was described by wit- nesses as a supply ship or mothership that rose into the air, banked sharply to the right, and flew east heading for the shore. The following evening Feb. 10, residents of Chorrillos, a suburb of Lima, reported seeing lumi- nous discs \"flying at a low altitude.\" In Jesus Maria, another Lima suburb, residents poured into the plaza to watch the overflight that was videotaped. Within the hour, another squadron of luminous UFOs flew over the seaport city of Callao, 13 kilome- ters west of Lima. By now, the word had spread, and a crowd of about 2,000 people witnessed the overflight of Callao. \"Neighbors in the zone went outside of their homes in the hope of seeing the OVNIs (Spanish acro- nym for UFOs) again.\" At 11:00 p.m. both Channel 2 and 5 Televi- sion Panamericana stunned all two million residents of Lima with a special 40-minute broadcast on the UFO flap. The show aired video footage of the objects fly- ing over Jesus Maria and Callao. Two luminous UFOs were seen flying eastward towards the Andes from lea, 400 kilometers south of Lima. On Feb. 12, more UFO reports came from the desert northeast of Lima as residents watched the UFOs pass overhead. According to Dr. Virgilio Sanchez Ocedo, the next day a startling videotape was shown on Channel 5 of a saucer skimming low over the roof- tops and palm trees of Callao.

Filer MUFON Eastern Director, Majorstar@aol.com (609) 654-0020 F-18 near miss in California SAN DIEGO — The International Society for UFO Research (ISUR) has received intriguing information from a former Air Wing Marine once stationed at Miramar Air Sta- tion. In November of 1995, a pilot in his squadron, VMFA- 212 (F/A-18Cs) had a near-col- lision with a slender cigar-\" shaped UFO. Interestingly, the UFO was recorded on the plane's \"Heads-Up Display video\" according to this former enlisted Marine who viewed the tape. Excerpts, with names, addresses and phone numbers deleted, from several e-mail exchanges between ISUR and the ex-Marine follow. Ex-Marine's initial description of a \"12:00 noon,\" November 1995, incident: \"I was in the Ma- rine Corps. Two of our pilots had just gotten back from a flight. One of them called for intelligence and me (flight scheduling rep). He showed us the Heads Up Display video from the flight. He was engaging the other pilot in a dogfighting exercise when a 'cigar- shaped' object zipped past the F-18. \"We slowed it down to a crawl, but it was trav- eling so fast initially that it was a blur even at the speed we viewed. The object came so close to the jet the pilot thought it would hit him. Later in the video, the F-18 in front is preparing to bank right. Just before he does a glare on the video banks quickly to the left about 2 seconds before either jet made a move. I personally acquired the flight clearance the day before and there should not have been any activity even in the area. \"However, it was never explained and shortly declassified. Everyone regarded the situation as ei- ther a mistake by someone on the ground or a natural phenomenon. According to what the pilot, and the rest of us saw on the video, the object was approxi- mately 12 feet in length and 3 feet wide. The name of the squadron was VMFA-212 (F/A-18Cs). The video has probably been copied over, deleted or discarded.\" On Feb. 22 and 23, 1999, several UFOs were reported in the Miramar Air Station area. Thanks to ISUR and board member John Thompson. Georgia F-4 accident and UFO Investigator John Thompson reports that on March 6, 1994, an Alabama Air National Guard F-4 exploded in mid-flight over Heard County, GA. A Heard County fireman, Bill Thompson, who is not re- lated to John, said that two minutes before the explo- sion and crash of the F-4, he saw the F-4 chasing a missile-like or cigar-shaped UFO. Bill's description was that the gray or silver-colored UFO was about \"a third to half the size of the F-4\" chasing it. This, of course, suggests a UFO of the same type and size that the California VMFA-212 pilot al- most collided with in 1995. Referring to the ANG explosion, in which the pilot died, the Air Force said the mishap was caused by bad welds. These inadequate welds, according to the Air Force's official crash re- port, originated with the plane's number one engine (GEOO420459). The failure of the welds, according to the USAF was the sole reason for the upper com- bustion case failure that subsequently caused the F-4 to explode in mid- flight. A General Electric engineer who subsequently investigated the crash, because of a law suit against General Electric, the manufacturer of the plane's en- gines, said that he thought the pilot had over-stressed the F-4, causing it to tear apart and explode. Of course, if the F-4 was chasing or suddenly encountered a small thin cigar-shaped UFO, as Fireman Bill Thompson claims, its pilot might over-stress his plane in his ex- citement. There is also a precedent for something exactly like this happening. In the Paris Air Show of 1972, the Soviets introduced their new TU-144 supersonic plane. According to a PBS Nova special that aired last year, the French now admit that they had a Mirage jet \"shadowing\" the Soviet aircraft and that the Soviet pilot on avoiding the Mirage, which before had been unseen, pulled the TU-144 apart. In the video of the plane's tragic crash, which was aired on Nova, the TU- 144 can be seen disintegrating and exploding in mid- air. Despite what the Air Force and the retired colo- nel said, the F-4's explosion could have come about from over-stress as General Electric's investigator said happened. These \"missile\" like UFOs have been seen repeatedly in the Long Island Sound area by commer- cial airliners. It can be speculated that one of these UFOs caused the TWA 800 disaster that, to many, still remains unsolved. The ex-Marine's testimony lends credibility to Fireman Thompson's claims that a UFO may have indirectly caused the ANG F-4 to explode.

The in- vestigation is further compli- cated when the only eyewit-- nesses disagree as to the fun- damental nature of the object viewed. Under these circum- stances, many cases quickly reach a dead end. But Minne- sota MUFON field investiga- tor Craig Lang, with assis- tance from Dr. Steven Hero, a MUFON consultant, over- came those handicaps with a well-reasoned case narrative. The Event At about 11:30 p.m. on Sept. 22, 1997, a 67-year-old woman was awakened by a loud noise out- side her mobile home in rural Frazee, MN. Expecting to see raccoons, she instead observed a lenticular-shaped object a few hundred feet distant, hovering low over a farm field. Five large white lights, nearly blinding in their intensity, obscured the surface area. Frightened but fascinated, with no telephone with which to seek help, she embarked on a vigil over the next two-hours. As her eyes adjusted to the glare which illumi- nated an expanse of the field, the woman perceived multiple blue beams between the blobs of white and extending outward. Twenty minutes into the event, as she returned to the window after rousing her 82-year- old companion, she confronted three smaller, less in- tense white lights in a triangular formation, fairly near the first object but motionless over a farmhouse. At this point the man arrived at the window. After initially assessing the primary object as a heli- copter, he concluded instead that the brilliance must be from an airport at the town of Perham (eight miles distant). The smaller lights nearby, he decided, were likely from an approaching train. Satisfied, he returned to bed. A few minutes later, the top light of the trian- gular formation suddenly darted toward the larger ob- ject, merged with it and was not seen again. The woman opened a window, but heard nothing despite a near absence of wind and no other masking sounds. She moved among windows in various rooms of the dark- ened home, yet gained no additional insights. At about 1 a.m., still frightened yet having witnessed no further movement of the lights, she returned to bed, but was unable to sleep. At 1:30 she arose again to find the two remaining smaller lights either resting on the roadway or in the adjoining field. She again went from window to window for an optimum view. By 2:45 the two lights appeared to be slowly approaching, bouncing slightly as they went. She wished for them to be the headlights of a truck, but realized they'were situated too far apart. Unnerved, she returned to bed to compose herself. Curiously, she fell quickly asleep and slept soundly until 8 a.m.. All was then back to normal. The Investigation Written testimony and sighting forms were obtained a week later. The woman and man are rela- tives of Dr. Hero, their veracity beyond question. On a visit a fortnight after the event, he visually inspected the field in question arid surrounding area, but found no evidence of a UFO landing. Neighboring residents available at that time could offer nothing. The investigators then postulated and evalu- ated all conceivable IFO possibilities: Distant lights or the moon on clouds can be discounted by the main object's fierce glare, both witnesses' good vision, and the three-plus hours comprising the episode. The humid night in this swampy area might possibly have triggered a plasma or power line corona. But the behavior of the triangle of lights, including their position above the farmhouse and one merging with the primary object, plus the sighting's overall duration, argue strongly against that. Lights from a train or railroad work are dis- counted by reason of the obscured view of the tracks from the mobile home, the elevation of the triangle of lights when over the farmhouse, and again the overall duration. A helicopter or other hovering aircraft would produce a detectable and familiar sound on this still night. One must consider reflections or refraction in respect to the windows from which the observations were made. However, screens were also in place, thus all but eliminating that possibility, especially given the separate darkened rooms. Distant city or airport lights are often a possi- bility, but a town's airport eight miles away would not likely be mistaken for LAX. The glaring main object reported near at hand by both witnesses must be ac- cepted at face value. Celestial bodies should certainly be considered. Sirius (magnitude - 2) and Procyon (magnitude 0.5) were in the general direction of the observations and near the horizon at 3 a.m. At midnight, though, only Aldebaran (magnitude 1.1 - not very bright) was"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal April 1999 Page 19 present. A final plausibility would be the headlights of a tractor working farm fields through the night. The long period of the main object remaining motionless as reported would argue against that. In the final analysis, it is appropriate to both accept the elderly gentleman's confirmation of some- thing unusual nearby and reject his helicopter/airport/ train lights assessment. Rather, the woman's steady, if frightened, observations of a brilliantly lighted disc and separate formation of lights is the far more reasonable conclusion. The important matter of purpose is less clear, though the woman's mention of falling into a hard sleep while greatly fearful of lights approaching her home must raise an eyebrow. Getting It Straight The Yuma, AZ, sightings noted here (MUFON UFO Journal December 1998) as occurring in August 1998 actually occurred in August 1993. That would not have altered the conclusion as to the contents of a complete case report. Still, I apologize for misreading the date on the submitted case narrative. Filer's Files...

Swissair near miss reported Stephen Thorn of The Canadian Press (CP) has learned that Swissair Flight 127 was cruising at 23,000 feet on Aug. 9, 1997, when the pilot interrupted an address to passengers to report the near miss by a round white object, as reported by the U.S. National Trans- portation Safety Board. \"Sir, I don't know what it was, but it just flew like a couple of hundred feet above us,\" he radioed Boston air traffic control. \"1 don't know if it was a rocket or whatever, but incredibly fast, opposite direc- , • 55 • tion. \"In the opposite direction?\" asked the control- ler. \"Yes sir, and the time was 2107 (Greenwich mean time). It was too fast to be an airplane.\" The control- ler asked another aircraft if its crew saw anything like a missile in the area? The reply was negative. He then asked the Swissair pilot again how far above the plane it was. \"It was right over us, right above, opposite direction, and, and I don't know, two, three, four hun- dred feet above. All that I can tell is that (we) saw a light object, it was white, and very fast.\" FBI, FAA and Safety Board Investigators interviewed the cap- tain and first officer on Aug. 10, 1997. The report, filed under NYC97SA193, said the flight was opposite John F. Kennedy Airport at 5:07 p.m. Eastern time-near the area where TWA Flight 800 went down July 17, 1996, after taking off from JFK; 230 persons died. Some believe a missile caused the midair explosion of the TWA 747 off Long Island. The Transportation Safety Board report said the Swissair captain saw the cylindrical object for less than a second. He did not see any wings and was not sure it was an aircraft. \"He had never been so close to other traffic before,\" said the report. \"It passed over the cockpit, slightly right of centerline. If it had been any lower, it would have hit the aircraft. \"As the ob- ject passed by, there was no noise, no wake turbulence, and no disruption or anomalies with any of the flight or engine instruments.\" The plane was flying in clear weather to Bos- ton from Philadelphia. He did not have time to take evasive action. \"There was no exhaust or smoke, and he could not accurately discern its size. The captain reported his total time as 15,000 plus flight hours. He had never seen a missile in flight.\" The first officer, whose flight time was 7,500 hours, said he was bent over, when he looked up and saw the object pass overhead \"very quickly. \"It was close enough that he ducked his head because he thought it would hit them. He thought it passed about 100 to 200 feet above the airplane and between the right side of the fuselage and the No. 3 engine.\" The first officer said no markings were visible and the object appeared to be the size of a thumbnail held at arm's length. He said he had previously en- countered a weather balloon over Italy, and the object did not look like the balloon. He had previously wit- nessed missile launches from the ground. The report said the nearest weather balloons are launched from Upton, NY, 45 miles northeast of JFK twice daily, at 3:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. Eastern time and usually take 25 to 28 minutes to reach 23,000 feet. Balloons are light tan or brownish, or black and red, adding the wind was blowing from the north, al- most at right angles to the aircraft. The Canadian Press, 1999, Dunn, Steven J.

We have evidence suggesting or proving that aliens have crashed and bodies were retrieved along three lines: (1) analysis of the Ramey letter, whose word- ing allegedly includes \"incrimi- nating\" evidence; (2) allegedly authentic documents confirming MJ-12; and (3) skeletal evidence of a possible alien body (or \"hy- brid,\" judging by the descrip- tion). Wow! The sensation factor is very high here, and accordingly it is absolutely imperative that critical-minded, forensic inves- tigations be conducted and the Richard Hall results submitted to thorough peer review. Anything less would be inexcusable. If any one of these three theses could be proved, the debate would be over. The only remaining task would be to force open the secret files and obtain the full story, and that would be prac- tically a foregone conclusion if we had the proof. Fortunately, there are signs that all three sen- sations are being submitted to careful study. Although I applaud the Woods for their conscientious effort to determine the authenticity of the MJ-12 documents, I am bothered that they have stated their conclusions before fully publishing their arguments and before al- lowing time for adequate peer review. All this will do is increase the level of rancor. Having seen the skeptical objections by some very knowledgable people, I am on record as being highly skeptical of all the MJ-12 documents. The Woods claim to have already dispensed with these objections. I don't buy that at all. There is not space here to state all my reasons. A few examples: (1) the \"identical UFOB reporting words in an FOIA document\" do not rule out a cut- and-paste job from real documents; (2) \"where...are examples of such faked documents?\" I have a file full of them!; (3) the Woods appear to assume that \"foren- sics\" are more important than \"provenance\"; that is highly debatable. And their argument that fakers would require access to fancy equipment overlooks the de- cidedly low-tech world of scissors and paste. But, as I have said in other contexts, my opin- ion or your opinion does not count for much. What counts above all is hardnosed, objective investigation that produces fact-based hypotheses, followed up by strong peer review. Only then will the findings be cred- ible. \"Sid Fiber's\" open letter to the Woods advo- cating linguistic analysis of key documents has my endorsement as one of many approaches to exhausting all avenues to provide the \"extraordinary evidence\" that will be needed to change made-up minds. Meanwhile, almost as a \"throwaway,\" we have some intriguing film and videotape analyses that sug- gest extraordinary phenomena. Still, we are preaching to the choir. Perhaps the most important issue we face is how to reach out beyond the choir.

The first session begins at 10 a.m. with Bob and Ryan Wood teaching how to research documents for authenticity. This includes an online exercise pro- jected on a giant screen and a demo of their CD-Rom. Moderator JOHN SHIRLEY will play devil's advo- cate/skeptical believer during this session. This will ensure a balanced presentation and the interjection of questions and observations often overlooked by Field Investigators. The final session will be presented by former USWeb CEO, Joe Firmage, who will discuss his ex- periences and views on the UFO Phenomenon, what it means to him, and why he stepped down as CEO of a multi-billion dollar company. There will be an hour long Q & A session with Mr. Firmage following his presentation. Special guests are also scheduled. Admission to the all-day affair is $30.00 and includes lunch.

V.V May 1999 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Venus (magnitude -4.2) stands prominently above the W horizon at dusk. The brilliant object does not set until about 11:30 p.m. in mid-May. Mars, after its closest approach to Earth on the 1st, gradually begins to dim its brightness during the month (to -1 magnitude). Look for it in Virgo near the star Spica in the SE at dusk. After twilight ends, it continues westward across the southern sky during the night. The red planet closes to within a few degrees of blue-white Spica by month's end, making a beautiful contrasting pair in the sky. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars sets in the W about 4 a.m. in midmonth. Jupiter (-2.1), in Pisces, emerges in the E about 4 a.m. in mid-May. Meteor Shower: A gibbous Moon washes out many of the May Aquarid meteors during the morning maximum on May 5. Under better conditions observers might have been able to see up to about 20 meteors per hour toward dawn. Lesser numbers of Aquarids can be seen from about May 1 to 8. The Stars: Late in the evening the spring constellations are well established in the southern sky. Leo the Lion, with its bright star Regulus, lies in the SW heavens. In the S reside Virgo the Maiden, with her star Spica and planet interloper Mars; Bootes the Herdman, with orange-tinted Arcturus; and the little U-shaped starry Crown of Ariadne, Corona Borealis.

The State/Provincial Director's Meeting will be held on Friday, July 2, from 9 a. m. to 5 p.m. All Assistant State Directors are also invited. If a State or Provincial Director is unable to attend, he/she should designate a member to represent them. Our MUFON Symposium will conclude at ap- proximately 6 p.m. on Sunday, July 4th, giving every- one adequate time to get situated for the National Fire- works on the Mall, starting at approximately 9 p.m. This is a fireworks display that you and your family will always remember as you see the Washington Monument and the reflecting pools highlighted by prob- ably the best display in the nation. With all the fasci- nating archives, museums and monuments to see, there is clearly something for the entire family to enjoy. Plan to visit Washington, D.C., our nation's capital, for the Fourth of July weekend. Proceedings Cover Contest The success of the 1996, 1997, and 1998 Sym- posium Proceedings cover design contest has prompted MUFON to make this an annual competition. Previ- ous winners have been Fran Geremia, Anson Scale, and Liz Coleson. The cover design should reflect the symposium theme, \"Transcending Politics and Com- fort Zones in Ufology.\" In addition to the theme, art- work must include the wording \"MUFON 1999 IN- TERNATIONAL UFO SYMPOSIUM PROCEED- INGS,\" the location, \"ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA,\" and the symposium dates, \"July 2-4.\" The contest submis- sions must be \"camera ready\" and not simply attrac- tive designs, symbols or artwork. The contest prize winner will receive $ 100 in cash plus $ 100 in MUFON publications or merchandise. Please submit entries to Walt Andrus, the Symposium Proceedings co-editor. The deadline for cover designs is April 15, 1999. If you are interested in submitting your artwork, please do so immediately, since none has been received as of March 19. MUFON Open Hours in Seguin, Texas Our business office at 103 Oldtowne Road is open for visitors Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. It is open by appointment on week- ends and holidays by calling (830) 379-9216. The MUFON UFO INFORMATION CEN- TER AND MUSEUM is open by appointment seven days per week at 624'North Highway 123 Bypass in Seguin, TX, by calling; (830) 379-9216. During the summer months (June, July, and August), we try to have volunteers at the Center during the hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The Center is located two miles south of Inter- state 10 at exit 610 on Highway 123 Bypass. Promi- nent signs identify the location in an office complex. Seguin, TX, is 35 miles east of San Antonio, 160 miles west of Houston on Interstate 10, and 45 miles south of Austin. If you are in this part of the country, try to visit our UFO Information Center and Museum. It is the only UFO museum in the nation east of Roswell, NM. Y'all come see us-you will be glad that you did. (The museum will be closed the week before and after the MUFON 1999 UFO Symposium in Arlington, VA.) Unusual Skeleton The article and photographs of the unusual skeleton that were published in the March 1999 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal under the title \"The Alien?\" by your International Director has created quite a stir in ufological circles on the Internet via the \"chat rooms.\" The domino effect has been very prevalent, with-very few facts suggested to support the chatter. I hope that each of the gregarious individuals (I am not listing names) will take the time to read the article and not rely on e-mail or chat rooms for their facts. Nowhere in the article did I claim that this was a skeleton of an extraterrestrial entity or creature. The similarity to a small grey was the basic reason for writ- ing this preliminary report so as to breed discussion and to uncover additional knowledge. Mrs. Slaughter promised to donate the skeleton to the MUFON UFO Information Center and Museum after the proposed motion picture is produced and released. (The real question about the motion picture is when and if.) If MUFON had possession of the skeleton, we could perform several tests to determine its authentic- ity. A DNA test of the bones would be invaluable, and material spectrographic analysis of the vest, sword handle, glass, and the metal rings could be very re- vealing. A plan has been instituted to perform these tests. Journal readers will be the first to know the re- sults of this ongoing documentation effort. If the skel- eton turns out to be an ET, imagine the implications. In the meantime, please use discretion before you believe everything you read on the websites and e-mail about the skeleton. A few people have said some very ugly things based upon second hand information. In spite of the few condemnations on the websites, no other articles in the Journal have sparked such favor- able responses by mail and telephone from our read- ers."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Page 24 April 1999 MUFON UFO Journal DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE Walter Andrus NEWS FROM AROUND THE NETWORK New Officers G.

Most of you attending the MUFON Symposium will be flying into Reagan National Airport, which is a scant half-mile from the Hyatt hotel. The hotel has a courtesy van to take you door-to-door for your conve- nience. Sometimes it is more practical or cost-effective to fly into Dulles Airport to the west, or Baltimore-Washington Airport to the north. If that is your situation, there is a wide range of alternatives on the last leg of your journey. There are local trains as well as organized shuttle vans that go between the air- ports. Sometimes a flight into BWI and a taxi ride into Arlington is less expensive and more convenient than flying directly to Reagan National.
