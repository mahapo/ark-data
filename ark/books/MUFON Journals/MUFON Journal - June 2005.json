Leo Sprinkle will present his exciting new paper \"The ET Presence: Cons and Pros\" at the 2005 MUFON International UFO Symposium in Den- ver, CO, July 22-24, 2005 (see insert for registration in- formation). Leo first spoke at a MUFON sym- posium in 1975, and we are ex- tremely pleased to have him back in 2005. Leo describes the \"Cons\" as \"confidence\" people who try to con us into discounting or denying the ET Presence. On the other hand, the \"Pros\" are the \"professional\" people who profess the reality of the ET Presence. Part of his conclusion states that \"we can anticipate further UFO reports which confound our views of science and reality. Further, we can predict that UFO 'games' will continue along the John Schuessler lines of military and physical games, sexual and biological games, political and psychosocial games, and healing and spiritual games.\" You won't want to miss Leo's presentation and his descrip- tion of the purpose of these games. Newest information on implants Dr. Roger Leir will present a hard- hitting new paper at the 2005 MUFON International UFO Symposium describ- ing physical evidence found in his im- plant research. He will describe the properties of three types of implants-metallic, non- metallic, and totally biological. You will also hear about two new pending surgi- cal cases. Roger says, \"The subject of UFOs and their occupants has turned the cor- ner in that those who once questioned even the existence of these vehicles are now looking at the occupants and their reasons for visitation.\" He is a leader in bringing the evidence together with the theories in a labora- tory environment and putting the sci- entific method to work on the problem.

David Twichell By David E. Twichell ©2005 O f all the impossible and im- probable anomalies discov- ered in scores of catde mu- tilations around the world each year since the 1950s, the presence of pure bovine hemoglobin may be the most im- portant. Yet the only known modern bio- chemical process to produce pure hemoglobin from human or animal blood requires a laboratory, a cen- trifuge, and strict temperature con- trol. For those un- familiar with the cattle mutilation phenomenon, ranchers have awakened to find one or more of their cattle dead on their property. Not just deceased, but, at first glance, brutally mutilated. The ranchers know that the particu- lar animal was alive and well as recently as 12 hours prior to the find. But die skeptic's unwavering and illogical con- clusion is either predator or satanic cult. Upon closer observation, it is discov- ered that the animal was not mutilated, as would be true in the case of a preda- tor, but \"operated\" upon. Specific or- gans were removed with laser-like pre- cision. In the typical mutilation, a similar pat- tern of hide and tissue are removed from the head. Usually an ear, eye, jaw flesh, the tongue, and sexual organs are removed. In almost all cases, the rectum and/ or vaginal tract in females have been cored out. The excision sites appear to be \"cauterized\" around the edges, indi- cating some form of heat was employed in the process. To add to the mystery, there is no sign of a struggle, nor are there tire tracks or footprints around the carcass-not JUNE 2005 jP?$a^ff$f even of the animal itself. Occasionally bones are broken at the point where the carcass has impacted the ground, sug- gesting it had been dropped from some height. As eerily precise as the unusual ani- mal deaths are, typically there is abso- lutely no blood to be found around or near the carcass. Further, the animal itself is completely devoid of blood. Other natural predators, such as coy- otes and wolves, typically refuse to go near the area of the carcass. In October of 2,000, biophysicist W.C. Levengood of The Pinelandia Bio- physical Laboratory in Grass Lake, MI, called Linda Moulton Howe to discuss his amazing findings concerning a bo- vine excision case that had occurred in 1997 in Red Bluff, CA. Levengood is a world-renowned bio- physicist who has worked extensively in the field of \"subtle\" or \"implicate\" en- ergies. He is well known for his work in studying crop formations and bovine ex- cisions. Ms. Howe is an Emmy Award-win- ning TV and documentary producer, in- vestigative reporter, and editor of the science and environment news website, Earthfiles.com. The full report, may be found at Ms. Howe's web site, MUFON UFO JOURNAL A typical mutilation. About the Author David E. Twichell is a MUFON Field Investigator and editor of the Michigan MUFON Newsletier. He is the author of The UFO-Jesus Connec- tion and Global Implications of the UFO Reality. He has his own cable TV show, \"We Are Not Alone,\" and has written numerous UFO articles. www.ufoimplications.com www.earthfiles.com (October 16, 2000 - Part 2) A 2,000-pound Black Angus bull had been discovered at the ranch of Jean and Bill Barton that displayed all the signs of a classic bovine excision. The bull was found in a hillside pasture about one-half mile from the only dirt road that led into the area and could only be reached on foot or horseback. Besides the typical earmarks of a genuinely anomalous excision site, small black, hardened specks were discovered on the chest and testicles at the point of the excision. Samples of these were gathered by field investigators Jean Bilodeaux and Royce Myers and delivered to Levengood for analysis. To Levengood's"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"amazement, he found them to be pure hemoglobin! To confirm his findings, he sent the samples to analytical chemist Phyllis Budinger in Ohio. Ms. Budinger used the latest state-of-the-art infrared spec- tral photometer to analyze the samples. Her research confirmed Levengood's findings that these were indeed samples of raw bovine hemoglobin. Levengood states in his report, \"The fact that erythrocytes, leukocytes and other components such as enzymes and hormones are missing-somehow they had to be extracted from the blood of the animal in order to obtain the very homogeneous hemoglobin. 'To do this, you need to break down me cell membranes to die erythrocytes and leukocytes to remove die hemoglo- bin molecules. To do this, requires a laboratory procedure with very precise biochemical steps. \"It's totally incomprehensible how the hemoglobin could be removed in the middle of the night out in the middle of a pasture and separated from all the other cellular components.\" He adds, \"Here you have two basic enigmas: how was it removed in the fresh state and remained biochemically active in a very pure form? And sec- ond, how was this formed into a solid that looks like a piece of old, black Bakelite-a very black, hard substance? \"So what this does, in my estimation, it takes it out of the realm of the preda- tors, takes it out of the realm of. devil \\ worshipers. This has to be an extremely sophisticated process. I have no idea how it is done.\" Identical evidence has been uncov- ered in bovine excision cases in Califor- nia, Oregon, and Alabama. Levengood had sent the particles to several laboratories for peer review, and they refused to even look at them. \"They took one look at this and said, 'This sure isn't hemoglobin, because whoever heard of hemoglobin in a solid, black form?'\" he said. In this writer's opinion, their igno- rance (and desire to maintain so) is the reason mainstream science has stag- nated in this and many other areas. In his Research Report dated June 22, 2002, entitled \"Biophysical'Study of Two Bovine Excision Sites at Christmas Valley, Oregon, 2002,\" Levengood dis- covered the same pure hemoglobin in two instances that occurred only days William Levengood before, and within six miles of each other. In excision cases, the vegetation sur- rounding the carcasses has been af- fected, as in crop formations, although he believes that two different-but simi- lar-types of microwave energies are being applied. Levengood says these could not pos- sibly be random energies within Earth's atmosphere, especially in the case of the bovine excisions, but rather purposely directed by someone or something. In the 2002 report, it is the first time that biophysicist Levengood publicly alludes to extraterrestrial intervention as a possible solution. As to the energies employed, he states: \"The results from these two sources, combined with data from past investi- gations, demonstrate quite clearly that the energy producing the changes in the plants is not of the same design or in- tensity as those producing the excisions or purifying the blood hemoglobin. ' \"The energy affecting the plants is of a more sub tie nature, giving the im- pression that it may be an artifact of the propulsion or internal energy com- ponents emitted by the TJFO' craft.\" Elsewhere in the same report: \"This local injury effect was not observed in plants at the bull excision site; however, in this case the energy source (UFO) was at a sufficient height above the soil surface to cause the induced magnetic field from the ion-electron avalanches to 'pick up' magnetic particles—thus ac- counting for the reduction in the level of magnetic particles near the animal as well as the log-log type of distribu- tion.\" MUFON UFO Journal In a phone interview with Leven- good, he told me, \"There is no way all of the blood can be drained from such a large animal, to include the capillar- ies-especially in a pasture environment.\" In light of the hemoglobin discovery and the missing erythrocytes and leu- kocytes from the carcass, he hypoth- esizes that the blood has been \"disinte- grated\" via some form of microwave technology that is yet unknown to mod- ern science. Both Levengood and Howe were in- terviewed for an installment of \"UFO Files,\" pertaining to cattle mutilations, which recently aired on the History Channel. Ms. Howe was the investigative re- porter working to collect samples for Levengood at the site of a mutilation in Farnam, NE, and the production crew followed her around. Levengood indicated that he was in- terviewed all day, and spoke at length of the hemoglobin find and its impor- tance to the bovine excision phenom- enon. Alas, not a word on the matter was aired. After more than 45 years of catde, horses, and wild animals being found bearing the same distinctive character- istics of intelligent intervention using advanced technologies, no one has ever been arrested in connection with these hideous acts. After coundess man-hours devoted to careful scrutiny of the evidence, bio- physicist Levengood, among many oth- ers, believes that the bovine hemoglo- bin discovery is the \"smoking gun\" evi- dence.

Burleson, Ph.D. I magine, if you will, that it is the late 1940s, and that you are Presi dent Harry Truman. It is two years or more now since the presidency dropped on you like a bale of hay. You have seen World War II through to a victorious end, and you have become a popular presi- dent during the postwar years. But you could do with- out the sort of message you have just re- Don Burleson ceived, one whose implications are chilling. The voice still reverberates in your memory after you've hung up the phone. The gist of it is that an anomalous ob- ject has crashed to earth somewhere in the desertlands of New Mexico, and the best intelligence suggests that this ob- ject did not originate on the planet. Remembering the Kenneth Arnold flying saucer sighting, as well as numer- ous other such reports, you are quick to understand that this news from New Mexico may well herald a spectacularly significant event. You are also acutely aware that you have very little time—a matter of min- utes—to decide upon the best mode of response. The military is already involved, but you must coordinate things by seeing to it that both the right military people and the right civilian scientists are on hand. You know that a great deal is going to be at stake. The decisions with regard to the mili- tary people, at least, are pretty clear-cut, and after a moment's reflection, the choice of civilians is too. You need people with Top Secret or higher security clearances and first-rate scientific knowledge. Among others, one name hovers around the top of the list—Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer. JUNE 2005 Although there have been, all along, questions about his political leanings, he has brilliantly spearheaded the effort at Los Alamos to build the world's first atomic bomb, ushering the United States both out of global conflict and into a new technological age. General Leslie Groves, director of the Manhattan Project, has defended Dr. Oppenheimer from the outset, ar- guing that scientists of Oppenheimer's caliber (and there were very few of those) have to be freethinking individu- als who cannot always be expected to toe the political party line. Oppenheimer was desperately needed at Los Alamos, and he is going to be desperately needed now. Such is the scenario you would have likely found yourself immersed in, had you been Harry Truman at that fateful time. It seems likely that President Truman would have thought of Robert Oppenheimer right away, along with certain other people. \"Oppie,\" as many were fond of call- ing him, was after all a kind of national hero, a thinker of virtually unparalleled reputation, and for good reasons-his acumen as a scientist was such that even the other physicists who had worked on \"the gadget\" at Los Alamos (a hand- picked crew bristling with genius, people like Hans Bette and Enrico Fermi, some of them Nobel laureates then or later) held Oppenheimer in awe. Already cleared He was already cleared, and it would be a relatively uncomplicated matter to send him in. Of course, the fact that it would have been imminently logical for Truman to send him to a UFO crash retrieval operation in New Mexico does not mean, without more substantial evi- dence, that it was so. But we do have more tangible evi- dence, at least for the early involvement of Oppenheimer with UFO-related ac- tivities, and this evidence takes the form of what I will call the SSS (Smith- Sarbacher-Steinman) correspondence. Two of the three parties to this com- plex of exchanges were government officials: Smith with the Canadian gov- MUFON UFO JOURNAL About the author Dr. Burleson is New Mexico State Director for MUFON, a MUFON Research Specialist, and a Field In- vestigator.

At one time he held a Top Secret security clearance in U.S. Air Force Intelligence as a Chinese language specialist. He is also fluent in Span- ish. ernment, Sarbacher with the U.S. William Steinman was an indepen- dent writer living in California who was later to write (with contributions from Wendelle Stevens) the book UFO Crash at A^tec: A Well Kept Secret (Tucson: UFO Photo Archives, 1986). Discussions of the SSS correspon- dence, in more detail than we shall need for present purposes, can be found in various places in the literature, e.g. in Steinman's book, and in Hesemann and Mantle, BeyondRosu>e//: The Alien Autopsy Film, Area 51, & the U.S. Government Coverup of UFOs, NY: Marlowe & Com- pany, 1997, pp. 79-85. The SSS interplay began with Wilbert Smith, an engineer who had taken his master's degree at the University of Brit- ish Columbia and served as the senior radio engineer for Canada's Department of Transport, later the Department of Communications. A new energy source Smith's special area of interest was geomagnetism, which he thought could be used as a source of energy and pro-"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"pulsion. When Frank Scully's book Be- hind the Flying Saucers came out in 1950, Smith was intrigued, beginning to theo- rize that saucer propulsion might have to do with magnetism. Since Scully's book discussed flying saucer crash-and-retrieval activities, and since Smith realized that there could be technological revelations in such circum- stances, he wanted to get in contact with scientists who had investigated crashed discs. Through apparently well-connected contacts at the Canadian Embassy in Washington, Smith obtained an appoint- ment widi Dr. Robert Sarbacher, scien- tific adviser to the Research and Devel- opment Commission of the US. De- fense Department, a distinguished sci- entist with an office at the Pentagon. Smith was treated to a substantial conversation with Sarbacher, taking de- tailed notes of what they talked about. Sarbacher told him, among other things, that flying saucers indeed existed and were highly classified, \"higher than die H-bomb.\" Top Secret memorandum Smith later composed a Top Secret memorandum, dated 21 November 1950, to the Canadian Secretary of Transportation urging the initiation of a \"Project Magnet\" to study magnetic propulsion; in this memo he specified that flying saucers' operating principles were unknown, but were under study in the United States by \"a small group headed by Doctor Vannevar Bush\" (Hesemann, 81). Bush was of course one of the men later said to belong to the group MJ-12. It is important to note, however, that at the time of all this correspondence nothing was known, to the public any- way, about MJ-12. Had the Smith memo been com- posed and filed in the United States, it would most likely have remained classi- fied forever, but in fact the Canadian authorities declassified it in 1978. The memo, along with Smith's notes (Smith had died in 1962) on his conver- sation widi Sarbacher, came to the at- tention (through Leonard Stringfield) of writer William Steinman. Steinman, desiring more information about die \"small group\" and their in- vestigations into flying saucers, wrote to Sarbacher, specifically focusing his questions with regard to what he had Dr. Robert Oppenheimer learned at that point of the Aztec re- trieval story from Scully, but also refer- encing crash retrievals generally. Responding to Steinman in a letter dated 29 November 1983 (on a letter- head reading \"Washington Institute of Technology, Oceanography, and Physi- cal Sciences, Dr. Robert I. Sarbacher, President and Chairman of Board\"), Sarbacher said that in the late 1940s and early 1950s many prominent scientists were actively involved in die study of crashed UFOs. He said that gatherings of such par- ticipants had occurred at Wright Field (later Wright-Patterson Air Force Base), though Sarbacher himself had not (he said) attended. Of those who did participate in crash-retrieval-related activities, Sarbacher elaborated, \"I can only say this: John von Neumann and Dr. Vannevar Bush were definitely involved, and I think Dr. Robert Oppenheimer also\" (Hesemann, 83-84). A need to know basis I would add that while Sarbacher here speaks only of official meetings having to do with retrieval of crashed UFOs, die normal condition for deciding who would be invited to attend such gadier- ings would be, aside from the appropri- ate clearances, the need to know. One could scarcely imagine officials at Wright Field judging that a civilian scientist had the need to know unless he was, or was shortly going to be, in- volved in the crash retrievals themselves or the analysis in their aftermadi. Thus the SSS correspondence indi- cates, as much by implication as by what it literally says, an Oppenheimer involve- ment in UFO crash retrieval investiga- tions. But there is another consideration altogether that suggests the same, in even stronger terms. Increasingly, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, Dr. Oppenheimer's politi- cal views came into question. In part diis was because he very vocally op- posed the development of die H-bomb, whereas his erstwhile Los Alamos col- league Edward Teller just as vocally championed the building of such a weapon. But the growing official uneasiness over Oppenheimer's politics also stemmed in large part from the fact, long known in government circles, that both his brodier (the physicist Frank Oppenheimer) and his wife Kitty had been members of the Communist Party, a cause that Robert Oppenheimer him- self had favored back in the 1930s. In the early 1950s Oppenheimer was working closely with die Atomic Energy Commission, but that organization was about to be taken over by Lewis Strauss, who made no secret of the fact that he detested Dr. Oppenheimer. Basically Strauss told President Eisenhower in 1953 diat he would ac- cept the position of chairman of the AEC, but only if Eisenhower got rid of Oppenheimer. The President capitu- lated; Strauss was in, and Oppenheimer, whose Top Secret security clearance Eisenhower ordered suspended, was out. This was in late December of 1953. Oppenheimer was given to understand diat he had the option of having hear- ings with the AEC to determine whether his clearance would be reinstated, and without hesitation he opted to undergo that procedure. It is with these hearings, I claim, that die real intrigue begins. I will argue diat the outcome of die hearings—and we all know Oppenheimer's clearance was denied in the end—does not flow logi- cally from either the nature of die com- plaints against him or the nature of die testimony at die hearings themselves, in- sofar as we are privy to what went on. Faulty process Something was gravely wrong widi the whole process even before the hear- ings of 12 April 1954 to 6 May 1954 began. MUFON UFO Journal June 2005"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Dr. Robert Sarbacher ©Geoff Olson 1996 Vancouver Courier Between the suspension of his clear- ance and the start of the hearings, Oppenheimer had four months to de- cide, with his attorneys, how to proceed with his defense, so to speak. (The hear- ings were not a trial, strictly speaking, but they might as well have been.) During this interim, Oppenheimer's private telephone line came under fed- eral wiretap surveillance, which in itself is scarcely surprising. What is not only surprising but shocking, though, is that transcripts of his strategy-planning telephone sessions with his attorneys were routinely turned over to the other side, i.e. to the AEC legal team that would be opposing him. Thus Oppenheimer would go into the hearings with his whole defense strategy already long since revealed to his opponents. (This, of course, under any decent standards, would be grounds for impeachment of those responsible.) Clearly, from early on, some people in government very desperately wanted Oppenheimer's clearance to be denied, no matter what had to be done. The reasons for this deserve a great deal of study. In any event, the hearings began on 12 April 1954, and over the course of the next three and a half weeks, forty witnesses would testify at length, includ- ing Dr. Oppenheimer himself. Closed-door hearings The hearings were closed-door, the press was not allowed in, and Oppenheimer's attorneys themselves, not being cleared, had to leave the room whenever classified information was presented, which it repeatedly was. But for the purposes of my inquiry, the most strik- ing feature of these hear- ings was the matter of who headed up die three-man ^,  board that officiated. His j name was Gordon Gray, f^ I To anyone well-read in P/'  I the field of UFO studies, that name should ring a bell. Gordon Gray, accord- ing to documents familiar to UFO investigators, was a member of MJ-12, die group purportedly as- sembled by President Truman in 1947 to oversee matters relating to flying saucers and crash-retrieval operations. I am quite aware that the reality of MJ-12 has been hotly debated in UFO circles, with some researchers accept- ing its existence and some not. For the purposes of the current ar- gument, I will take the stance that MJ- 12 did indeed exist and did function pretty much as described in the docu- ments usually put forward. (One can have access to all these documents at www.majesticdocuments.com.) This is, in fact, my own view of the matter. With all respect to those who have argued otherwise, I find the pro- MJ-12 work of such outstanding re- searchers as Stanton Friedman, Dr. Rob- ert Wood, and Ryan Wood to be per- suasive. The mysterious Gordon Gray Gordon Gray, or \"MJ-9\" in terms of die usual list of members, was an attor- ney, a publisher, a broadcaster, a former state senator, and at one time the presi- dent of the University of North Caro- lina. He served as assistant secretary (eventually secretary) of the Army dur- ing the Truman years, and had held vari- ous government-related posts, includ- ing chairmanship in 1954 of the AEC's Personnel Security Board, the group that deliberated over the Oppenheimer case. (Gray's membership on MJ-12 does not generally appear in published ac- counts of his credentials and experience, needless to say.) The Gordon Gray papers, some 7,800 pages of them, reside in a special collection at the Dwight D. Eisenhower Library at Abilene, KS. According to library stipulations (by agreement with Gray himself as donor), certain kinds of papers are \"withheld from research use,\" including, signifi- cantly, \"papers relating to investigations of individuals or to appointments and personnel matters.\" The Gray papers, overall, occupy some four feet of shelf space and are divided into five series, of which Series IV is 'The J. Robert Oppenheimer Case, 1954-75.\" Series IV is then divided into Subseries A, B, and C, where Subseries B, according to library records, \"con- sists of the PSB [Atomic Energy Commission's Personnel Security Board] hearing transcripts and has been withdrawn in its entirety. These tran- scripts contain unpublished portions which may relate to national security.\" The catalog goes on to list, for the withdrawn Subseries B, 19 volumes of \"Oppenheimer Hearing Transcript\" material running to some 3,314 pages altogether. It is interesting that this whole body of material, published and unpublished portions alike, has been made unavail- able. As the withdrawn material certainly satisfies the description of \"papers re- lating to investigations of individuals\" specified in the library's list of stipula- tions, one can only gather that Gordon Gray himself, when donating the papers to the Eisenhower Library for their pres- ervation, was not eager to encourage too much public familiarity with these tran- scripts. Gray died in 1982, and the library is apparendy committed to respecting his wishes in perpetuity. The Government Printing Office, after a complex series of maneuvers in 1954 soon-after the hearings were con- cluded, did publish a version of the Oppenheimer hearing transcripts, typo- graphically condensing them from over three thousand pages down to just un- der a thousand. Asterisks instead of details As a form of redaction, strings of asterisks were substituted for classified portions, sometimes with the effect of concealing whole paragraphs or even whole pages.

A careful reading of even the unclas- sified transcripts will make it clear that the reasons ultimately given for the de- nial of Oppenheimer's clearance were less than convincing. The question of Communism With regard to the question of mem- bership (which Oppenheimer himself apparently never held) in the Commu- nist Party on the part of relatives and associates of Oppenheimer's, a number of witnesses argued quite cogently that the view of Communism had changed. Although in the 1930s it had been fashionable in some intellectual circles to be a Communist, this had been not so much a political as a philosophical stance having more to do with empathy for the poor and downtrodden-and with suspicion of corporate excesses-than with any connection to international power conspiracies. Mrs. (Kitty) Oppenheimer remarked to the AEC panel, \"In the days that I was a member of the Communist Party, I thought they [philosophical commu- nism and Soviet Communism] were definitely two things. \"The Soviet Union had its Commu- nist Party and our country had its Com- munist Party. I thought that the Com- munist Party of the United States was concerned with problems internal. I now no longer believe this\" (Polenberg, 215). As Oppenheimer's one-time col- league, Charles Lauritsen, put it to the AEC panel, \"I think there is a great deal of difference between being a Commu- nist in 1935 and being a Communist in 1954\" (Polenberg, 220). It became very clear during the weeks of testimony that Oppenheimer and his family and most of his earlier commu- nism-inclined friends had become dis- enchanted with the Communist Party because of its evolution from a domes- tic to an international cause, and had moved away from the Party well before the Los Alamos period. Kitty had left the Party by the time she and Robert were married in 1940, and Frank Oppenheimer had left the Party by 1941. It is important to note that, even so, Robert Oppenheimer's political leanings were under official scrutiny during the early 1940s when he was being consid- ered for leadership of the Manhattan Project, so that it is difficult to under- stand why the same government that did not censure him in 1942 thought it rea- sonable to do so in 1954, even after he had proven his dedication and loyalty. The key, I would suggest, is the fact that Gordon Gray was running the day- to-day operation at the ARC clearance hearings. There had to be more to the matter than Oppenheimer's long-renounced prewar political leanings, or his running argument with Edward Teller about the desirability of building the H-bomb. Those things themselves fall flat without some darker reason in the back- ground—some reason that had not been there in 1942 but was there by 1954. Here we recall the SSS correspon- dence indicating Oppenheimer's early involvement in UFO crash retrieval op- erations, and we must note that as a member of MJ-12, Gordon Gray, offi- ciating over the so-called Gray Board at the AEC hearings, would have known that Oppenheimer knew things classi- fied \"higher than the H-bomb\"—things that he had not known in 1942 or even in 1945. Gray would have known that Oppenheimer was continuing to learn government secrets of unprecedented and unparalleled sensitivity. Next month: Part 2 UK man reports sightings of strange objects in 1998, 2000 Andrew Bell, Ashburton, Devon, UK, has sent the following sighting re- ports to MUFON: First sighting, Dec. 13,1998: This was a crystal clear night and a craft passed over our window twice, along with a satellite travelling in a dif- ferent trajectory but at the same speed. The craft had an illuminated outer rim with four large round white lights in a straight line underside. Second sighting September 2000 This was a close encounter about 8 PM. The craft passed across a valley and directly over our heads, with clear sky and little wind. This craft was illumi- nated on all edges, and very large. This object was cubic and L-shaped, as large as a jumbo jet. It had a slight protrusion at the rear, with three balconies above. Within the protrusion at the rear were mesh dishes which were emitting a blue/purple light-this seemed to be propelling the craft at around 40 MPH. The underside of the object had three large white lights, two at its tall end and one at the other. These were joined by huge pipes. The craft was so close we could see the bolts on the pipework. The craft emitted an electrical hum- ming noise which was not loud, al- though it sounded very powerful. My pictures are made with my com- puter so do not do justice to the UFOs we have seen with our own eyes. 1998 object sighting. 2000 object sighting. 8 MUFON UFO Journal June 2005"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Ufology Profile Ted the king of traces By Dwight Connelly T ed Phillips, considered the world's foremost authority on physical traces associated with UFOs, has been involved in ufology since 1964, and was a research associ- ate with Dr. J. Allen Hynek from 1968 until Hynek's death in 1986. It was Hynek, a close friend, who sug- gested in 1968 that Ted specialize in physical traces, noting the need for ufologists to become skilled in certain key areas. Since that time, Phillips has been di- rectly involved with some 600 UFO cases. In addition to spending thousands of hours investigating, he has also been active in sharing his research—participat- ing in numerous meetings and presen- tations, including the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Aero- space Sciences Meetings, along with Hynek, Dr. Jacques Vallee, and David Saunders. Ted was a member of an elite team invited to meet with the United Nations Secretary-General at the UN in New York, along with Hynek, Vallee, and as- tronaut Gordon Cooper. Phillips gave two presentations at the First International UFO Congress, and has appeared on national television on \"In Search Of,\" NBC News White Pa- pers, CBS News Special Reports, and a public education documentary movie, \"UFOs Are Real.\" Ted has taken part in countless radio and television talk shows, including the Larry King Radio Show, and been a popular speaker at MUFON sympo- siums. His most recent presentation was at the Ozark UFO Conference in Eu- reka Springs, AR, in April. Ted, who lives in Missouri, has worked as a civil engineer, professional photographer, professional race car driver, professional musician, and spe- leologist. He participated in the Van- guard Satellite Tracking Program, and was a field engineer on the Minuteman Missile Project. In 1998, Phillips set up the Center for Physical Trace Research (http:// Ted Phi Hips www.angelfire.com/mo/cptr/), with files containing 3,091 physical trace re- ports from 91 countries. In discussing the mission of the Cen- ter, Ted points out that \"it has been said that little, if any, real evidence exits which could prove the existence of Unidentified Flying Objects. While it is true there is no known.absolute proof, there is tangible evidence available for study. \"Without question, if solid evidence exists, it should be found in the physi- cal trace events—reports in which cred- ible witnesses claim to have observed the landing or near landing of an un- known object, and then to have found traces of that landing.\" Ted notes that \"over the past 36 years, specialized research into Close Encounters of the Second Kind has resulted in a wealth of such events in every major country of the world. Physi- cal traces present us with the most di 1 rect approach to resolving the mystery of UFOs.\" He points out that \"traces remain as visible evidence long after the reported object has gone. If UFOs are not avail- able for study in the laboratory, the resi- due is. Alleged UFO landing sites may be photographed, measured, sampled, and subjected to laboratory analysis, and have the potential to reveal data relat- ing to the size, configurations and per- haps method of propulsion of UFOs.\" He emphasizes that \"this is not al- lowed by any other type of UFO event. The traces are UFO fingerprints, and it becomes obvious that various types of objects leave individual signatures. Some sites have remained visible for many months and in some cases, years after the UFO event.\" Ted explains that \"physical trace land- ing events push us to the edge of what we can or should believe. They are in- credible, but the witnesses have re- mained credible, and the residue unex- plained. They seem to represent a visit, however brief, by something unknown.\" His hope for the Center is that it can provide a central repository for the col- lection, study, and distribution of data. \"The Center will take advantage of current technology,\" he explains. \"Un- like the'l'960's, we now have the ability to communicate at incredible speed. We are in a position to receive new cases almost as they happen.\" He explains, \"In these cases, time is critical, and full on-site investigation should be done. With email and digital images it is now possible to' take any- one seriously interested to a landing site in near real time.\" He says the Center \"has no interest in taking cases away from local research- ers, but in working with them. The only interest is in obtaining data and residue using the proper methods of research and analysis. I have no interest in group politics; it is a waste of important time.\" He says the Center can work at a dis- tance or on site, depending on the wishes of the local investigators. Of the more than 600 cases that Ted has worked on, he says the most impor- tant project is one he is currently inves- tigating. It involves what appears to be an ancient structure deep in a cavern in the Tatra Mountains in Slovakia. The case had its beginning more than 30 years ago. \"In 1970,\" says Ted, \"Dr. Hynek and I interviewed the Czech army captain who found the artifact during WWII in 1944. \"He and two of his 168-man group survived a fierce fight with the Ger- JUNE 2005 MUFON UFO JOURNAL"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"mans. They were left for dead and were aided by a Slovakian farmer, taken to the cave, and hidden from the German forces. \"In a search for food (bats), the Czech, after going nearly two miles into the cave, found a structure which is shaped like a fat crescent moon with walls seven feet thick. He was able to enter the front wall, which was framed by cave formations which had devel- oped over most of the outer wall through a thin crack. \"Inside,\" Ted continues, \"he found himself in this very large vertical struc- ture, between two curved walls which were like a black mirror. It is a fascinat- ing series of events, the history of which I have explored during two trips to the area. \"On the last trip I did find what I believe is the cave in question. Currently I'm trying to obtain funding for a third trip to reach the artifact and finish the job.\" In addition to the primary investiga- tion, Phillips says that \"each trip to Slovakia/Ukraine has presented new physical trace cases involving UFO land- ings. On the last trip in 2002 a bright circular object descended on a long flight path over a nuclear facility. The facility, had been in operation for two weeks when the event took place. 'The object, seen by many residents of Levice, stopped over one of the ac- tive stacks and hovered for 10 minutes, 10 to 20 feet above it. It then ascended at high speed vertically. \"The security video cameras were ac- tivated and footage was obtained by cameras located all around the facility. One clip was carried by Slovakian Na- tional Television before it was pulled. \"I went immediately to Levice, and found many witnesses, but they were afraid to give any detailed information. I tried to obtain copies of the footage without success.\" After almost 37 years of specializing in UFO trace events, what does one of the more conservative mainstream ufologists think about UFOs? \"I believe the data indicates con- structed, physical machines which are under some kind of intelligent control,\" says Phillips. \"The devices can, and do, interact with their immediate surround- ings in a very physical way. What these objects represent or where they might originate are open questions.\" 10 MUFON Forum California case That is an interesting compilation by Preston Dennett about the best UFO cases from California, though as of this writing, the series has not finished yet. I have a correction about case num- ber 20 (April 2005 issue, p. 3). Dennett called the witness of the famous Cisco Grove case \"Donald Smythe.\" This took me totally aback. Most sources give him the semi- anonymous name of Donald S., but a couple of places I have seen \"Donald Schrum,\"' the first one being Lou Parish's column \"In Others' Words,\" in MUFON's old Skylook No. 102, of May 1976, p. 18. The book that was the subject of the review included the case, but did not give even the witness' first name. Lou wrote me Feb. 6,2003: \"I honestly don't remember where I first saw the name, but it was 'a reliable source or I would not have given it in Skylook\" Dennett has written me that he did see the name Schrum in Richard Hall's Uninvited Guests (Aurora Press,'! 988, pp. 248-249). However, he opted instead to use Smythe, as given in Timothy Good's Alien Ease (Avon, 1988, pp. 262-265). If Good just invented a surname starting with \"S,\" shame on him! Un- less Dennett had good reasons to trust Good rather than Hall, at least he should have noted the two versions of the name. -Richard W. Heiden Dennet responds: Thank you for forwarding die letter from Mr. Heiden and giving me a chance to respond. As far as the Donald Smythe/Donald Schrum case, Mr. Heiden may be cor- rect. Most sources I have say only Donald S or Mr. S. Only a few mention his full name. Richard Hall's book Uninvited Guests (Aurora Press, 1988, pp248-249) uses the name Schrum; however, Timothy Good's Book, Alien Ease (Avon, 1988, MUFON UFO Journal pp262-265) uses the name Smythe, which is what I decided upon. Of course I don't favor Good over Hall. Both are prominent, respected re- searchers. -Preston Dennett Good responds I'm surprised that Heiden didn't check my source for the Cisco Grove story, which I list in Alien Ease as \"The Cisco Grove Bow and Arrow Case of 1964,\" by Ted Bloecher and Paul Cerny, International UFO Reporter, vol. 20. No. 5, Winter 1995, pp. 16-22, 32. Donald Smythe is the pseudonym used by those The Jennings UFO special When you consider such one-sided past programs as NOVA's two UFO presentations, I diought ABC's treat- ment generally was fair and balanced. And instead of poking fun at the topic, the Jennings special offered a so- ber and serious discussion for die most part. Even the ratio of \"experts\" trotted out before the cameras was about equally divided between believers and nonbelievers. In the vast majority of UFO cases cited, both sides of the ar- gument were given their due. Almost all aspects of this multifac- eted phenomenon were touched upon, from unidentified nocturnal lights to close-range structured objects and ab- duction episodes. On the odier hand, die program fo- cused too much on recreating the less- convincing night light sightings to the exclusion of the more important, harder-to-explain reports of landed or near-earth craftlike objects. The capsule modern history of UFOs was well done. Indeed, die two- hour program must have been a real eye- opener to anyone unacquainted with the entire spectrum of what is known sim- ply as \"unidentified flying objects.\" Another positive was honoring die (Continued on next page, column 2) June 2005"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The Aztec Crash nan ot> sam m\\v.

Reviewed by Dwight Connelly For those with an interest in the re- ported crash of a UFO at Aztec, NM, but who have yet to make it to the area or to the an- nual symposium, this video is the next best thing. The reports of the March 25, 1948, crash have suggested. that up to 1 6 alien bodies were discovered inside die object, and that the alien bodies and all evidence of the spacecraft were soon transported by government officials to a secret lo- cation, where all traces of this event dis- appeared. The video includes interviews with UFO researchers, a walking tour of the alleged crash site, and a look at the now abandoned secret US radar station that may have tracked— and perhaps caused— the UFO crash. The key investigator of the crash— at least in recent years— is Scott Ramsey (see August, 2004, MUFON UFO Jour- nal), and he is the featured ufologist in this video. He and wife Suzanne have uncovered several key witnesses in die case, at least two of whom have died since being interviewed. Thus, as in the case of Roswell and other older cases, it is crucial to find and interview additional witnesses before too much time passes, and die Ramseys are working hard to do this. Also interviewed are Nick Redfern, Richard Dolan, and Stan Friedman, all of whom seem to regard the case in a positive light. But Karl Pflock, one of the debunk- JUNE 2005 ers of Roswell, states that he is not con- vinced that the crash story is anydiing more than a tale by two shady charac- ters who conned the well-known and re- spected journalist Frank Skully, who was the first to bring the case the case to the public. Skully told the story of Aztec back in 1950 in his book Behind the Fly- ing Saucers. Pflock does acknowledge, however, the March, 1950, \"Farmington Armada Case\" in which hundreds of objects, led by a red object, were seen over Farmington, NM, only 14 miles from Aztec. The \"armada,\" still led by a red UFO, was later spotted by Las Vegas postal workers. In addition to new;witriesses, ; who report actually seeing the downed craft— and even climbing onto or in it-there is possible physical evidence at the site in the form of cement castings with rein- forcement rods. These were reportedly used to pro- vide support for one or more cranes that moved the object. The reinforcement MUFON Forum (Continued from Page 10) legacy of Allen Hynek. Flis courageous public switch from scientific skeptic to believer in the face of mounting criti- cism by fellow scientists deserves a place of remembrance in ufological history. Some day, after the dust has settled, I feel certain that Hynek will be cred- ited for his foresight and courage toward solving the UFO mystery. On the other hand, it was a bit trou- bling that John Mack's ABC interview was left out. His view was needed in the abduction segment to counter two other psychologists who sought to explain all abductees as victims of false memory or sleep paralysis. While I happen to believe SP is im- plicated more than many abduction in- vestigators realize, nevertheless SP im- agery cannot account for most outdoor; multiple-witness, and physical-trace UFO abduction reports. MUFON UFO JOURNAL rods are being studied in an effort to positively date them. A rather large book about the case, UFO Crash at A^tec, A Well Kept Secret, by William S. Steinman (with contribu- tions by Wendelle C. Stevens), was pub- lished in a limited edition in 1986. This was well before the latest rev- elations by the Ramseys concerning new witnesses and possible physical evi- dence, although this book does suggest that the UFO was accidentally disabled by powerful radar in the area. This video is a very interesting and well-done update of a case which is turning out to be more and more cred- ible. The latest information on Aztec will be provided by Ramsey at this summer's MUFON International Symposium in Denver, set for July 22-24. Ramsey may also have copies of this video for sale in Denver, since he has been selling them for the Aztec public library as part of the library's fundraising activities. Finally, one of the highlights of the entire two hours turned out to be in the concluding segment with theoretical physicist Michio Kaku. He beautifully countered the by-now, hackneyed attitude of most astronomers that \"they (alien spacecraft) can't get here from there\"-that interstellar travel is impractical if not impossible due to the great distances between stars. Kaku accused such individuals of having narrow thinking—that they should rather be looking a million years ahead when other civilizations may have found ways to breach die distance gap (wormholes, etc.). Not only did the physicist say that some UFOs might indeed be space ve- hicles, but also the topic certainly was worthy of scientific study. \"Let the investigation begin,\" Kaku remarked.

There was a large 12 disc in the tree that just shot away into the sky. \"We spotted several perfectly cut branches in the tree. Many cut branches were lying on die ground. It had been hovering in the tree, and many branches were bent as though it was sitting there watching us the whole time. \"Earlier that morning we were in bed and our door alarm went off.

Cyprus UFO spotted NICOSIA-LARNACA HIGHWAY - A British resident reported seeing a UFO on April 27, 2005, when several other motorists all slowed down their vehicles to watch the UFO spectacle at around 8:45 PM. The witness says, \"It was in front of me, and as soon as I saw it I started slowing down, and so did the people in front of me. Then, it speeded up at an incredible speed, hundreds of miles an hour in seconds, and literally disap- peared in front of our eyes. . \"It was amazing. It looked like the kind of height of a low-flying plane or a helicopter. That's why I didn't imme- diately think it was odd, and then as it started to move and speed up I thought, This is weird.' It was a bright, white sphere of light hovering slowly.\" . The man said he checked online and found that UFO sightings were not all that uncommon in Cyprus. One Civil Aviation official said, \"The radar does regularly register what seem MUFON UFO Journal to be aircraft, but which disappear after three revolutions of the radar. We call them Angels, and generally put these 'phantoms' down to weather interfer- ence.\" UFOs have been spotted over Cyprus on many occasions in the past.

It made a huge constant loud rumbling noise as it passed by slowly. \"The lights were amazing, with a white and green dot on top with a long streak of lights along what looked to be the bottom or side. The long streak had to be close to 100 yards in length, and die streaks changed color periodically from white to red and to blue. \"I did capture the craft on video, with the noise over our house, but the video does not do it justice.

New Jersey couple spot UFO WEST MILFORD - An executive phoned to tell me he was in his bed- room watching TV with his wife on May 7,2005, at 11:30 PM, and she noticed a pulsating star with changing colors through the skylight above them. She insisted this was not an ordinary star, so they decided to look at it through a modified telescope. Looking through the eyepiece, the object consisted of two squares off center, with bright chang- ing lights in each point of each corner of the object. The eight brighter lights had lines connecting the two squares. Some smaller lights were inside the squares. The object seemed to consist of two square objects tethered together. . The wife is from Russia and phoned her father, who is former general in Soviet Air Defense. He stated matter of factually that they had seen a UFO. He was instructed in school about disap- pearance of ships and the UFO phe- nomenon. They were frequently chased by Soviet fighters. Alien encounter in Australia? BANORA POINT NSW - The wit- ness reports, \"I have something that has shocked our family and their beliefs of extraterrestrials. About four weeks ago I noticed a cut on my back that was un- explained. 'The cut was about three inches in length, and was deep. There was no blood, however. The cut has formed into a scar, which looks similar to that of a surgery-related operation. My mother woke me this morning and com- plained of back pain. After checking, I realized that her cut was identical to my cut and I showed her mine. \"After taking photos, we both noticed that our scars were exactly the same length. Hers, however, was on the left side of her back, and mine was on the more upper right side of my back.

China and extraterrestrials WUCHANG CITY - Meng Zhaoguo, a rural worker from north- east China's Wuchang city, says he was 29 years old when he broke his marital vows for the first and only time-with a female extraterrestrial of unusually ro- bust build. \"She was three meters tall and had six fingers, but otherwise she looked completely like a human. I told my wife all about it afterwards. She wasn't too angry.\" While few Chinese claim to have managed to get quite as intimate with an extraterrestrial as Meng, a growing number of people in the world's most populous nation believe in unidentified flying objects, or UFOs. Officially registered UFO associa- tions in China have about 50,000 mem- bers, but some estimate the actual num- ber of Chinese interested in the subject is probably in the millions. Sun Shili is one of the most serious enthusiasts, and he knows exactly where he will be the day the extraterrestrials finally make contact with mankind. The 67-year-old retired Beijing professor will be in the 21-member delegation picked by international UFO associations to represent Earth as the first negotiations get underway. Once a Spanish translator for Mao Zedong during high-level state visits, Sun says language will not be a prob-, lem. \"We expect to communicate using telepathy,\" he says. Colorado mutilations reported SAN LUIS VALLEY - After a seven- year hiatus from San Luis Valley, appar- ently the mysterious cattle surgeons are back. Although rumors of other cases have circulated over the past few years, no official reports had been filed until a rancher reported a mutilated cow found south of Monte Vista. Another case may have occurred last month near Jaroso, when a motorist chased an '\"orange light\" and returned to the site two days later and found what he described as \"a mutilated cow.\" The Sheriff of Conejos County re- ported a case in December, 2001, but the witness refused to officially report the mutilated cow found in the field where a landed object and bright \"blue and red lights\" lights were seen the night prior.  , . 14 MUFON UFO Journal June .2005"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Physical Traces By Ted Phillips i Vehicle effects Physical traces associated with UFOs are not always effects on soil and plants in the immediate area of the observed object. UFOs have generated effects on vehicles resulting in substantial damage during close approaches. Eighty-eight events from twenty-one countries have been reported to date. Vehicle damage reports are significant, as the effects are available for study for a much longer period of time than soil/ plant damage. It should be noted that many additional cases of vehicle EM effects exist with no physical traces reported. The earliest vehicle effects report took place in 1953. Such events continue to this date. The files indicate the top producing coun- tries to be the U.S., Australia, England, Argentina, and Brazil/Norway in de- scending order. In the US, the states with the highest number of such events are Texas, Ohio, North Carolina, Minnesota, and Michi- gan. The reported cases indicate the peak sighting period to be between 1800 and 2300 (local time), with a large spike at 2300.35% of the reported observations took place during the daylight hours. 52% involved multiple witnesses, with a maximum of eight witnesses to a single event. Five cases involved mul- tiple objects, 10 cases multiple vehicles. Twenty-four of the vehicles were levitated from the road surface, and EM effects were reported in 30 cases. Hu- man effects are found in 16, and hu- manoids were seen in eight cases. Extreme heat was present in seven of the reports, and radiation was de- tected in four. Following are three significant re- JUNE 2005 ports involving automobile paint chang- ing color and secondary effects: Paint color changed In November, 1953, while driving near Gjersjoen Bridge, Norway, three witnesses—Mr. Trygve, Mrs. Buflot and a neighbor-observed an object as it as- cended from behind a hill. It oscillated over the lake for more than one minute, moved rapidly toward the witnesses and followed their car. The object passed over the vehicle and hovered ahead of them very low to the ground. Mr. Trygve stopped the automobile, and they watched the sta- tionary object. During the sighting all three experienced mild electrical shocks until the object ascended vertically. A watch stopped working, and nu- merous people vouched for the fact that the paint on the car changed from dark beige to a bright green. Eight months later, on July 20,1954, two men driving near Oslo, Norway, were chased by an object for several minutes. They stopped their car to ob- serve it hovering a short distance away. A watch stopped- working, and the paint on the car changed color. On Nov. 4, 1974, a single witness driving near Scottsdale, Tasmania, at 2300 observed a soundless object of great size. His car engine and radio cut out, and his watch dial lit up brightly. The object moved away, and suddenly ascended vertically. The watch stopped shortly after the event. The left-hand mudguard of the car changed color from red to orange, and the color change was permanent. Liquids dropped or sprayed There are numerous reports of odd liquids found after UFO landings or near landings. The following are ex- amples of such traces found in vehicle events. On June 29,1964, near Lavonia, GA, businessman Beaufort E. Parham was driving home at 2300. \"I spotted a very bright light in the sky coming toward my car,\" he explained. \"The next instant it was directly in front of my headlights, MUFON UFO JOURNAL About the author Ted Phillips is considered the fore- most expert on physical trace reports in the world. /For additional back- ground see the Ufology Profile in this issue.

It was shaped like a top and made a hissing sound. \"The top part of the object was mov- ing in a clockwise direction, and the bot- tom part in a counterclockwise direc- tion. A tower-like projection was at the top with a dark band. \"Vane-like configurations were also observed. Small portholes dotted the bottom, through which flames could be detected. Disappearing in a flash, it re- appeared a second time. \"It stayed directly in front of my car for at least a mile, about five feet ahead. It was one or two feet above the road. It suddenly went up over the car. It re- appeared a third time, heading for the car. \"The motor began to miss, and I stopped the car. It took off and disap- peared in a split second.\" Parham's arms began to burn. FAA officials who interviewed the witness called him intelligent, sincere, and so- ber. The oily marks on the car and the burning effect on his arms remained even after they were washed. The car hood was warped, and paint was bubbled up. On Aug. 1,1971, a couple from Fin- land, Ben and Helen K, had left Gladstone, Australia, at 2350 for Rockhampton, a driving distance of 79.5 miles. The trip took only 40 minutes, and would have normally taken much longer. They could not recall driving through any of die towns along the way. Both witnesses did remember seeing an un- usual green light at some point along die way. Their 1971 Valiant was covered with 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"a thin film of odorless oil, and unusual marks were found on the vehicle top. On Nov. 14, 1973, a single witness was driving on State Road 1470, two miles east of Poteet, TX, at 1850 when he observed an object hovering low over the road. Humanoid figures were seen through a window on the object. The witness did not stop, and as he went by the object some liquid dropped from the UFO onto his car. The paint on the hood peeled off and was ruined. Highway Patrol officers saw the damage and took samples of the residue. In November, 1975, multiple wit- nesses near Aar, Rhodesia, observed an object that passed low over their car. The object sprayed liquid onto the sur- face of the automobile. On the night of July 8, 2000, Ozlem Seydali and his family were driving from Ezen to Vakifkoy in northern Turkey. As they reached a point 15 km outside the town of Ezen they noticed a bright circular light hovering over farm land. At first Mr. Seydali thought it was the full moon (the moon was in first quar- ter phase). There were seven people in the car, ranging in age from 22 to 52, and all witnessed the object. As they approached, it appeared to be stationary, and was enveloped by its own light from the bottom up. There appeared a bright blue flash of light at the base which then extended to the top. At this point the object disappeared. Shortly after, a residue of some kind completely covered the car. The win- dows were rolled down and there was no odor. The windshield was so com- pletely covered with this residue that the driver had to execute an emergency stop. In seconds the residue evaporated without a trace. After reaching their destination, they asked a neighbor if she had seen anything odd in the .sky. She said she had seen it along with many others. There was much confusion in the neighborhood as to what had transpired. The area was experiencing extreme dry heat, and it seemed that there was mois- ture on the dry grass and dirt. I contacted Mr. Seydali and asked if any samples of the residue had been taken. He replied, \"Unfortunately, as much as I would have liked to get a sample of this residue, it was virtually impossible at the time, as there was 16 nothing to contain a viable sample in. Also it was a residue which when left exposed to air it evaporated.\" On July 23, 2000, in the Ashtabula, OH, area, three witnesses, ages 60 to 70, were driving a new Cadillac at 0100. The vehicle was suddenly surrounded by numerous small lights. \" The lights followed the car down the highway at high speed for 40 miles. During the encounter the car's alarm system went off and on, the car radio was reset, the clock lost time, and a sticky residue formed on the windshield. No samples were taken. Vehicles set afire If one were looking for physical evi- dence providing a long term investiga- tion, the following events might be of considerable interest. On Nov. 11, 1957, Bill H. was driv- ing home just outside of Provencal, LA. It was raining lightly when he saw a large, lighted object on the road ahead, which he thought was a truck. Suddenly the object flashed a beam of light directly at the vehicle, appar- ently exerting a strong pressure and slowing the car to a stop only 15 feet from the object. The witness described the object as oval in shape, 15 feet long, 9 feet high, and a dull green color. He could see let- tering beginning with the letters UN, followed by several numbers. A wave of heat filled the car, and the witness jumped out in panic as the car caught fire. The object ascended with the sound of a diesel engine. The man ran into town and reported the event. The car, a 1956 Ford, was completely destroyed. On Aug. 28,1962, near Salta, Argen- tina, at 1900, three witnesses in a truck observed a huge object over the high- way. They estimated the circular object to be 150 meters in diameter and very low over the road surface. The event was also seen by two ad- ditional witnesses in a car behind the truck. The object suddenly ascended a few feet vertically and moved toward the truck. The object hovered directly above the truck for about one minute. The huge mass then moved away, and as it did so, the truck engine ignited in flames and the entire front of the ve- hicle was destroyed. On May 22, 1973, Miguel Gonzales was driving his truck near Vera Cruz, MUFON UFO Journal Mexico, when his engine failed. He re- ported to police that he saw beings like dwarfs on the road. He observed a landed circular object just off die road. A flash of light was projected on his vehicle, the truck burst into flames, and was \"burnt to a mass of molten metal.\" Oh March 22,1976, a couple driving near Nemingha, Australia, at 0545 stopped dieir automobile after seeing a bright greenish-yellow light descend from the sky. A car approaching from the opposite direction was enveloped in the light from the object. The light then disappeared as the approaching car moved to the wrong side of the road, became enveloped in a thick ball of white haze, and stopped. After about two minutes the white haze disappeared. A woman got out of the car and used a cloth to wipe the windshield. The car lights were out, but after a few minutes the woman was about to get back into the car when the lights came on. The cloth that had been used burst into flames. '' Vehicle levitations Vehicle levitations are one of the most intriguing and potentially evi- dence-rich effects generated by UFO close approaches. Center for Physical Trace Research (CPTR) files contain 22 cases in which a vehicle was levitated and physical evidence found. One of the classic vehicle levitation cases took place in Australia on Jan. 20, 1988. Four members of the Knowles family-Mrs. Knowles, 43, and her sons Sean, 21, Patrick, 24, and Wayne, 18- were driving from Perth to Melbourne in a late model Ford Telstar. It was about 0300. when they ob- served lights approaching them. The car radio started to fade in and out. As the object neared the family it appeared as a white light, \"an egg in an egg cup; in the center of the egg was a yellow light.\" At this point another vehicle, a white station wagon, was seen coming from the opposite direction. Sean swerved to avoid hitting the light and nearly hit the station wagon. The light then disappeared, reappear- ing behind them. Sean made a U turn and pursued the object. Again the ob- ject disappeared, and in seconds made contact with the roof of the car and lifted the vehicle off the road. Mrs. Knowles rolled down her win- June 2005"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"dow and placed her right hand on the roof. She felt a \"spongy\" substance at- tached to the car roof. She quickly re- tracted her hand and the back of her hand felt warm, the sensation disap- peared in a few seconds. After an indeterminate length of time the object dropped the car to the road. As the car contacted the road a tire burst, and they were forced to brake to a stop. After the car dropped to the road, Mrs. Knowles rolled the window down and \"smoke stuff\" came into the car. This smoke was a \"greyish-black mist.\" During the observation a number of events occurred: •The sound of their voices changed in pitch and seemed to slow down. •A humming sound was heard. •All the witnesses became hysterical, shouting and crying. Mrs. Knowles said she believed they were going to die. •The two family dogs reacted vio- lendy. •A smell like \"dead bodies\" was in the air. •The car started shaking. After stopping the car, the family ran from the car to hide in the nearby scrub. The object remained near the car for several minutes before leaving. They returned to the car after about fifteen minutes. Investigators found an indentation on the roof of the car. The tire that failed was in good condition and should not have blown, but in fact was ripped all the way around its edge. Laboratory analysis of the \"dust\" on and inside the car revealed \"oxygen, carbon, calcium, silicon, potassium, and astatine. Astatine is a radioactive chemi- cal that can only be produced syntheti- cally. It should be noted that two other vehicles were involved in the incident: Vehicle one was the station wagon that was nearly hit by the Knowles car. Vehicle two was a truck driven by Graham Henley, 57. Henley saw a light in his mirror which looked like a \"big bright...like a big egg, like a fried egg hung upside down....like a very high powered spotlight.\" There are a number of reports in which an unidentified flying object ac- tually collided with a vehicle, leaving behind considerable physical traces. I'll talk about some of these cases next month. Marine pilot reports UFO over South China Sea My friend in Taos, NM, served two tours of duty in Vietnam. A Marine Corps pilot, Carl was shot down twice. The second time he served 21/2 months in a Vietnam prison before re- patriation. I have waited almost eight years to relate this pilot's UFO story, and now may do so, but only by using a pseudonym. Carl and three other pilots were or- dered to pick up four F8 aircraft in Ha- waii in November, 1965. Carl's aircraft was an F8U (Crusader), a single-seat jet fighter. The four aircraft flew in formation to Guam, refueling twice in mid air. From Guam, they flew together toward the South China Sea to rejoin their car- rier, the USS Coral Sea. Carl, a brand new second lieutenant, flew in the No. 2 position. The flight flew west from Guam at 30,000 feet at 400 MPH. All of a sud- den on the intercom, \"Jesus, what's this?\" Carl looks to his right and sees a bell-shaped flying machine 600-800 feet away, just off the wingtip of the pilot in No. 4 position. (See Carl's drawing above.) \"Jesus Christ,\" from another pilot. Carl looks again over his right shoulder and sees the craft clearly. It was bell-shaped, and about the diameter of the wingspan, tip to tip, a distance of about 60 feet, Carl explained. A line of glowing clear lights could be seen along its lower rim. The color of the strange ship was metallic silver-gray, and there were portholes around its sides. The pilots learned by radio that Guam had the intruder on their radar. After a few minutes the strange craft raced ahead of the flight, rose, became a speck, and disappeared. No photo- graphs of the strange craft were taken by the pilots. After landing on the Coral Sea, the four pilots were told by flight command- ers not to talk about their sighting. Soon they were debriefed by two officers from Naval Intelligence, and a second time by two Air Force Intelligence Officers who landed on the carrier by helicop- ter. A report was collected from each pilot. Two of the pilots in this account did not return from Vietnam. The lead pi- lot, a 1 st lieutenant at the time, is re- tired and living in Corpus Christi. Carl is trying to contact him for his input. There is a footnote to this story. Carl said in his lifetime he has experienced four or five moments which were truly spiritual. This sighting was one of them. It caused him to think about how small a part of the whole we really are, how vast the universe must be, and it caused him to keep an open mind about strange things in the air. \"I know for a fact,\" Carl said, \"that the ship we saw was not of this world.\" —James Parsons, El Prado, NM, an Air Force navigator in the 1950's.

The ob- ject was first sighted by my wife, Crys- tal, as we left our house at 1014 Court St., walking outside to our van. She pointed up in a direction above our van and exclaimed, \"Doug! look up!\" She guided my attention up to the object, which appeared similar to two bright stars that moved in perfect uni- son, as though they were joined some- how by an invisible structure of some kind. They moved together through the sky lengthwise, not side by side: N. East <— * * <— S. West Whatever this flying craft was, it ap- peared to be very large, and seemed to move very quickly. At one point a pri- vate plane (much smaller in compari- son) could be seen intersecting above or below its flight path. ' This object appeared out of our southwestern sky and moved silently above and over us, heading in a north- eastern direction. It did not exhibit erratic flight char- acteristics, as is the case in some UFO reports, but I did witness what seemed to be a course adjustment in the flight path as it appeared to turn slightly east- ward before traveling out of our sight. I easily ruled out a satellite because of the distance between the two light sources, which moved in unison. The second reason to rule out the satellite theory is the course change. We called our children to come out to see this flying object. Crystal unsuc- cessfully attempted to videotape it. 18 tometer instrument for their studies, and the process may be volcanism, geysers, or gasses escaping from the surface or the interior of Enceladus. Enceladus is a small, ice-covered moon orbiting 147,948 miles (238,100 kilometers) away from Saturn. The moon takes 1.37 Earth days to perform a complete rotation. When Cassini did its first encounter with Enceladus on Feb. 17 at an alti- tude of 725 miles, its magnetometer detected a striking signature in the moon's magnetic field. On March 9, Cassini approached to within 310 miles of Enceladus's surface and obtained additional evidence. The observation showed a bending of the magnetic field, with the magneto- spheric plasma being slowed and deflected by the moon. In addition, magnetic field oscillations were ob- served. The observations from the Enceladus flyby are believed to be ion- ized water vapor. In 1981, NASA's Voyager spacecraft flew by Enceladus at a distance of 56,000 miles without detecting an at- mosphere. It is possible that such de- tection was beyond Voyager's capabili- ties—or something may have changed since the 1981 flyby.

MUFON UFO Journal Planet outside solar system photographed European and American scientists say they have photographed a planet outside the Solar System for the first time. The European Southern Obser- vatory group said the red image is the first direct shot of a planet around an- other star. The planet, known as 2M1207b, is about five times the size of Jupiter, and is orbiting at a distance nearly twice as far as Neptune is from our Sun. The parent star and planet are more than 200 light-years away near the south- ern constellation of Hydra. There has been a lot of competition among astronomers to secure the first direct picture of an exoplanet. When the ESO group first released the picture last September there was doubt over whether the star and planet were gravi- tationally bound. But follow-up images taken at the Very Large Telescope facility in Chile show the two objects are moving to- gether. It is extremely difficult for current technology to even detect exoplanets. All of the 130 or so exoplanets discov- ered thus far have been found using in- direct methods—looking for changes in the properties of stars (their brightness or the way they move) that can be ex- plained only by the presence of a planet.

By Rick Hilberg Somehow it seems as if stories about alleged crashed UFOs pop up con- standy lately, told by people from all sorts of backgrounds, and in many in- stances seemingly reliable. I have to run die above disclaimer to the story that follows, because I hon- esdy don't know what to make of it. Like some or all of the crashed UFO sto- ries, it may be true-and then again it may not. I received a call in late August of 1981 from John [full name on file], a seemingly sincere man who doesn't want his last name used in this account, who was puzzled by a sighting that he had sometime in July. Since he could not remember the specific date, his report of a typical day- light disc that made a number of acute maneuvers, including a 90-degree turn, wouldn't be of much use to us in our statistical catalog of UFO reports, so I politely listened to his account and in- formed him that we had many like it in our files. After asking me about UAPA's local chapter in the Cleveland area and our activities, he asked whether we had ever heard about people who claimed to have seen crashed UFOs, and whether we could place any stock in these reports. After I replied in the affirmative, and told him that we were interested in any such reports we might stumble onto, he told me that something happened to him when he was a young man that has puzzled him a great deal, and that he hasn't even told his family for fear they wouldn't believe him. As best as John can remember, the incident took place in August of 1952. He was looking around in a downtown Cleveland stamp shop when he struck up a conversation with another cus- tomer. John said that diey discussed stamps for a while, and generally seemed to enjoy each other's conversation. John described this new friend as a heavy-set man of about 32, with a sort of dark complexion and a crew cut. During the next several weeks they would meet to discuss stamps and sometimes to play a few games of chess JUNE 2005 About the Author Rick Hilberg, a veteran researcher, is editor of publications for United Aerial Phenomena Agency (UAPA) and the author of several publica- tions. He was one of the organizers of die first National UFO Confer- ence back in 1964. over at John's house. John reported diat his friend would win every one of their chess games, even though John was dien a pretty fair chess player, and had won many games in a chess club when he was at school. John said at the time he felt as if this person could read his mind, because he seemed to know his next several moves. John related that his friend (he never would give me his first name, and ad- mitted that he had forgotten his last name) claimed that he was a chemical engineer for the state of Ohio, and worked with testing paint, or some simi- lar line of work. He also seemed to know a great deal about technical subjects. John related that they would be walking down the street and his friend would suddenly start rattling off all kinds of detailed information regarding a passing car, or how some complicated piece of machin- ery worked. John said that it seemed that this man knew far more about any technical sub- ject that even an engineer would know. He also noticed that the man always spoke textbook perfect English, and al- though he claimed to be from Ohio he had a slight accent that John couldn't place. After knowing him about three weeks, John was invited over to the man's house for dinner and an evening of chess. It was sometime after dinner when John said his friend got a photo- graph out of a drawer and handed it over, asking whether he had ever heard about flying objects. John replied that he didn't know too much, but had read reports of them in the paper from time to time. John said he looked at the photo- graph and was amazed to see what ap- peared to be some sort of large machine MUFON UFO JOURNAL that had crashed into the side of a hill. He said whatever it was, it was really badly damaged by the crash, because parts of its outer skin were shredded and lying around all over the crash site, and that only a badly twisted frame re- mained that reminded him of an um- brella shape. He was sure, however, that whatever it was, it certainly wasn't any sort of air- craft that he was familiar with. John said there were two bodies lying on the ground near the craft, and they appeared to be human shapes charred horribly as if by a great fire. He stated that he estimated them to be between four and five feet tall, but when asked how he could be sure of their height he replied that it was just a guess on his part. He asked his friend just what the photograph showed, but got no reply, and the photograph was put back in its place and the two went on to a game of chess. After not hearing from the man for a week, John decided to go over to his house to see if anything was wrong, as he usually heard from him every day or two. When he knocked on the door he was startled to be confronted by an older woman who eyed him suspiciously. The really strange part was when he was told that it was impossible that his friend lived there, because the woman was the only one living in the house, and she had lived there most of her adult life! No, she had never seen or heard about anybody like him living in the neighborhood, and asked John to go away, as evidently she thought he was either crazy or out to do her harm. John said that he never again heard from the man, except several days after the incident with the woman he received a birthday card from his friend. But John was certain he had never mentioned that he had a birthday coming up. That's the end of the story, and I have to admit that it sounds a lot like the mysterious empty house story that Ken- neth Arnold wrote about during his in- vestigation of the Maury Island \"hoax\" in The Coming of the Saucers. All I can say is John appears to be puzzled by the whole affair of long ago. 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"PERCEPTIONS By Stanton T. Friedman UFOs no security threat? In the course of preparing my paper \"Government UFO Lies\" for the July MUFON Symposium (Denver, July 22- 24), I became much more aware than I had been of the enormous number of cases in which US fighters chased UFOs in the 1951-1954 time frame. Frank Feschino Jr, author of the im- portant new book The Braxton County Monster: Cover-up of the Flahi'oods Mon- ster Rerea/ed,\" has been collecting case reports from the Neif York Times and a number of older books such as Edward Ruppelt's The Report on Unidentified Fly- ing Objects, as well as several by Maj. Donald Keyhoe, Harold P. Wilkins, the Blue Book Files, etc. Surprisingly, there were quite a num- ber of dogfights between UFOs and military planes in Richard Hall's excel- lent The UFO Evidence, both the 1964 version and his 2001 Volume 2 update. The surprise is because Dick made quite a fuss after hearing that Frank's book contained a number of such ac- counts, claiming he was very familiar with that period and there weren't any. I suspect that Dick had forgotten de- tails of those close encpunters as had I. Frank and I joined forces, and we had help from Dr. David Rudiak, who did such excellent work on the Ramey memo interpretation, and from Barry Greenwood, who has an enormous col- lection of clippings about UFO reports. He had earlier provided a number of UFO and \"supposed\" meteor reports from the September, 1952, time frame at my request, since the Flatwoods (WV) Monster case took place on Sept. 12, 1952. I had also later asked him for clip- pings from July, 1952, indicating that pilots had been instructed to shoot down UFOs. He found several. Dick was also upset when I noted, in defense of Frank's account of an F94- C disappearing in the Gulf of Mexico, also on Sept. 12, 1952, that I had qui- etly heard of six different cases in which more aircraft had been sent up to chase UFOs than had returned. Dick asked 20 for copies of the reports and of my de- tailed investigations. I had no written submissions, since these were all told me very quietly after lectures, and had also apparently, and not surprisingly, been very classified events. I don't dis- cuss these at my lectures, so consider each case indepen- dent of the others. I feel that if I have heard of six cases, there had undoubt- edly been many more. I almost in- advertently Stan Friedman discovered that the 56-page Preliminary Inventory of the \"Records, Headquarters USAF, Record Group 341 \"(More than 9,800 feet of material) at the National Ar- chives included a strange listing for Entry 60: \"Messages Relating to Aircraft Accidents, Apr-Dec. 1952.\" There was supposedly three feet of messages for just this nine-month pe- riod! That, in turn, reminded me of the provocative and apparently very accu- rate comment, first noted to me by Paul Kimball, on page 5 of the Nov. 18, 1952, Eisenhower Briefing Document: \"In addition, a significant upsurge in the surveillance activity of these craft be- ginning in May and continuing through the autumn of this year has caused con- siderable concern that new develop- ments may be imminent.\" Equally surprising to me was that this was the only time period called out for \"Messages Relating to Aircraft Acci- dents.\" Remember now, these are not the accident reports, but merely mes- sages (usually teletype) about them. Fortunately, after speaking at the X- Conference in Gaithersburg, MD, in April, I was able to spend two-plus days MUFON UFO Journal at the National Archives in College Park, MD, where they had pulled this mate- rial for me in advance, per my request. I found only two pages about the Sept. 12 disappearance, but a huge col- lection of military accident messages. Some had several pages of follow up, but the Sept. 12 case did not, at least in those files. These were all teletypes with lots of abbreviations, not letters or memos. Planes were falling out of the skies. I have ordered four reels of micro- film supposedly containing the actual military aircraft accident reports for Sept. 10-15 and July 25-31 from Max- well Air Force Base in Alabama. The latter dates were selected be- cause of the clippings that were found with such headings as \"Air Force Or- ders Jet Pilots to Shoot Down Flying Saucers if They Refuse to Land.\" Lt. Col. Moncel Monte, an Air Force officer, is quoted as saying, \"The jet pi- lots are and have been under, orders to investigate Unidentified objects and to shoot them down if they can't talk them down.\" (Seattle Post Intelligencer, July 29, 1952). Another clipping headlines: \"Jets told to Shoot Down Flying Discs\" (Fall River Massachusetts Herald News, July 29, 1952: \"Jet pilots are operating under 24- hour alert to challenge the mysterious objects and to 'shoot them down' if they ignore orders to land.\" Certainly a number of possible car- toons come to mind picturing that situ- ation. There was also a letter from Mr. Farnsworth, president of the American Rocket Society, to President Harry Truman which stated that this wasn't a sensible policy. It was publicized, and I have a copy. Most serious ufologists are well aware that there were loads of radar and air- borne sightings over Washington, DC, in July, 1952, and that there was a huge press conference on July 29 featuring Gen. Samford (Air Force Chief of In- telligence) trying to explain away all the radar and visual sightings as tem- perature inversions. What I certainly June 2005"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"wasn't aware of was a statement by Maj. Gen. Roger Ramey. Yes, this is the same officer photo- graphed on July 8,1947,with a hard-to- read memo in his office in Fort Worth, TX, where he, as a brigadier general, commanded the 8 th Air Force, of which the Roswell based 509 th was such an important part. The Louisville, KY, Courier of July 30 says: \"Major General Roger Ramey, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Air Force Staff for Operations, told the news con- ference that interceptor planes have raced aloft several hundred times as a result of reported sightings of uniden- tified objects. He said that was just stan- dard procedure.\" Couple this with the comments about pilots being ordered to shoot down UFOs, and it seems we were making every effort to attack saucers. Would it be surprising if they decided to retali- ate? For more than 35 years the official Air Force position, repeated over and over again, was \"No UFO reported, in- vestigated and evaluated by the Air Force has ever given any indication of threat to our national security.\" No threat, but pilots were ordered to shoot them down.??? I discuss these and •related false and misleading Air Force statements in TOP SECRET/MAJIC. While pondering this contradiction, I received an email of an article from the May, 2005, Airport journals, which described how a pilot, Eddy Balocco, July 22-24-36th annual MUFON UFO Symposium, Marriott Tech Cen- ter Hotel, Denver, CO, featuring Phyllis Budinger, Richard Dolan, Elaine Douglass, Stanton Friedman, Paola Harris, Alan C.

JUNE 2005 of a Marine Panther F9F fighter was scrambled at about 10 PM the evening of Feb. 11,1953, from a Marine base in Edenton, N.C. He was vectored by ground radar towards a UFO which was suddenly off the radar. He spotted it well below him, but was running low on fuel and headed home. Suddenly it rose up very rapidly, almost to his 20,000 foot altitude. He sped up, headed right toward the disc-shaped object widi red lights. Be- cause of his 85 missions in Korea, he squeezed the trigger. Fortunately, in my opinion, his guns had not been loaded. When the object was only about 350 feet away, there was a very strong blue white light so intense that he could see the bones in his hand for a brief time. There was not much activity at the base that night, and somebody had goofed. He was interrogated at length by Navy and Marine officers. I managed to locate Balocco and spoke with him by phone. He is 77 and a lawyer and sounded sharp as a tack. He will be sending me a much more detailed account of the event written just a few years ago. He had been told not to talk, and didn't for decades. The point of bringing up these de- tails from long ago is that I can only wonder how many planes were de- stroyed by the UFOs after the planes had tried to attack the alien intruders. The F-94-C's, which first flew in July of 1952, were equipped with a couple of dozen powerful mighty mouse rock- ets rather than much less effective ma- chine guns. It is distressing that many of the planes that crashed or disappeared were piloted by pilots who had flown many missions in Korea . Three had more than 100 combat missions. It just doesn't seem very likely that they would crash. It seems that there is a major hidden history here. The most interesting ar- ticles were not in the Washington Post or the New York Times. While it is not too late in our races with the undertaker, I would surely like to hear about other articles and from other military personnel who became aware of pilots lost because of a very close encounter with a UFO. Everybody has heard of Capt. Tho- mas Mantell, who went up after a UFO in January, 1948, and crashed after he had approached it at high altitude.

All of the MUFON UFO Journals, as well as Skjlook, consisting of 9,169 pages of material from 1967 -2004, have been scanned, and searchable CDs for each year are available for sale by MUFON headquarters. All MUFON International UFO Sym- posium Proceedings, consisting of 7,487 pages of material from 1971-2004, have also been scanned, and searchable CDs of each book are available for sale. The extensive MUFON UFO report files dating from the formation of MUFON in 1969 to the present are being scanned. At this point, 13,004 pages have been scanned, but thousands of more pages are yet to be processed. The main limi- tation on a quick completion of this work is lack of funding. Tax deduct- ible donations are welcomed. UFO Awareness Month MUFON has designated July as \"UFO Awareness Month.\" All MUFON state and local organi- zations are urged to use this opportu- nity to provide public education about the serious nature of the UFO prob- lem. This can be done through contacts with radio, TV, and newspapers, by speaking at schools, libraries, and com- munity organizations, and by becoming a local resource for factual information. A good way of proclaiming UFO Awareness is to wear the MUFON UFO Awareness T-shirt. The shirts are available from MUFON headquarters in two colors-black with white letters and white with black letters. The shirts have the MUFON logo and the words \"UFO Awareness\" on the left front and the words \"Others talk, we investigate...\" on the back. The white shirts are priced at $15 in the U.S. and $19 outside the U.S. and the black shirts are $18 in the U.S. and $22 outside the U.S. Contact MUFON headquarters for a discount on large quantity orders all going to the same address.
