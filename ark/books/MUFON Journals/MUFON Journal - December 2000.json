Filer Director, MUFON Eastern Region New evidence concerning the bizarre phenomenon generally known as \"cattle mutilations\" (or \"bovine excisions,\" the term preferred by Michigan biophysi- cist Wm. C. Levengood) has recently been presented to the anomalous phenomena research community. In a 1997 \"Study of Bovine Excision Sites From 1993-1997\" written by Levengood and mailed out by the BLT Research Team, a case on the Barton Ranch in Red Bluff, CA (Site #8 in the 1997 report) included the finding that some black particles recovered from the hide of the dead bull were most likely hemoglo- bin. Levengood noted that the matrix color of the par- ticles was a deep red, with a fine-grained amorphous structure which is not typical of whole blood, further noting that the heme molecule, with an attached oxy- gen molecule, has a red color. An EDS (energy dis- persive spectroscopy) was obtained and indicated pre- cisely the spectra which would be expected from a hemoglobin matrix: carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and iron, with small amounts of trace elements typical of biological samples. The question then (as well as now) was how this hemoglobin was separated from the other blood com- ponents and fabricated into the compact homogenous structure discovered on the hide of this excised bull. In the early part of this year the expertise of an analytical chemist with infrared spectroscopy capa- bility became available to the BLT Team. Phyllis Budinger, from Chagrin Falls, OH, examined two samples of the particles retrieved from the testicles and chest areas of the excised bull. Infrared spectra were obtained from both samples, as well as references of hemoglobin and whole bloods using the Harrick SplitPea cell attached to a Nicolet Avatar 360 spectrometer (ATR crystal used was sili- con). Both samples were identified as bovine hemo- globin. Further, the spectra of these samples do not match that of whole blood, dried at ambient temperature in the laboratory, nor do they match spectra obtained of dried whole blood exposed to microwaves and after one week air exposure. Ms. Budinger's results con- firm unequivocally that these samples are not only hemoglobin, but also that they are bovine hemoglo- bin, probably from this dead and excised Black An- gus bull. As Ms. Budinger indicates in her report, the usual Another researched case Dr. Colm Kelleher of the National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS), described an especially interesting mutilation case at the MUFON Sympo- sium in St. Louis this past summer. In this case, which occurred in October of 1998, a three-year-old registered polled Hereford cow was found dead by the owner, who had seen the animal in good health the previous day. The cow's left eye and periorbital tissue were removed, as was part of the left ear. A full necropsy (autopsy), followed by toxico- logical, histological and chemical analysis, revealed the following: 1. Both the left periorbital tissue and left ear were removed with a sharp instruments), as confirmed by two of the three veterinary pathologists respec- tively; 2. No evidence of high heat or cautery was ob- tained from these cuts; 3! No signs of struggle, and no tracks found near the animal; 4. An unusual, formaldehyde-containing blue gel-like substance was found in the eye, the ear, and the anus of the animal. Using headspace gas chromatography mass spectrometry analysis, the blue gel-like substance was shown to contain 300- 3000 ug/g of 2,6-bis-dimetnylethyl-4-methyl phe- nol, a synthetic molecule with anti-oxidant and anti- viral properties, as well as contaminants of normal putrefaction breakdown products from cow tissue. 5. The animal's heart was shredded, yet its peri- cardium (membrane sac enclosing the heart) was intact; 6. The animal tested positive on two different pregnancy tests, yet there was no fetus present at the time of the necropsy, and no sign of spontane- ous abortion; 7. It is suspected that the cow's blood contained high levels of potassium chloride; 8. The cow had extremely low liver copper lev- els and low Vitamin A levels; 9. Severe hemorrhaging under the hide around the neck of the animal was observed; 10. The animal was normal for routine bacteri- ology, virology, and toxicology scans. The totality of the data suggests the animal did not die a nor- mal death."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 December 2000 MUFON UFO Journal procedure for isolating hemoglobin from whole blood is rather complex: \"It involves separating .red blood corpuscles from the lighter plasma components by centrifugation. The plasma is siphoned off and ether is added to the corpuscle paste, causing the cells to burst. Another centrifugation removes the ruptured cell envelopes, and leaves a clear red solution of he- moglobin. It is unlikely that a procedure such as this would be done on site. It is unknown how or why this occurred.\" When I spoke to Nancy Talbott of the BLT Re- search Team about the apparent need for laboratory equipment to produce these pure hemoglobin particles she pointed out that Jean Bilodeaux, the BLT fieldworker in this case, had clearly indicated in her field-notes that this bull was found in a very isolated pasture-more than 1/2-mile from the nearest dirt road, on a steep hillside which was strewn with volcanic rocks and boulders. \"I don't see how a lab-on-wheels could have got- ten in there,\" she says, \"and because of the steepness of the hill and the fact that large boulders were strewn everywhere, I doubt that a lab-in-a-helicopter could have landed. Ms. Bilodeaux also pointed out that this animal was lying on top of a small boulder, with its body twisted unnaturally as if it had fallen from some height-and it was lying with both of its right legs and its tail up under the body. Jean's impression was that this animal may have been dropped into the location where it was found. I wonder if the process respon- sible for creating the hemoglobin particles was car- ried out elsewhere.\" In addition to the hemoglobin particles found on this animal and now conclusively identified, Dr. Levengood's 1997 report indicated that very high Rr (redox ratio) values were found in the grass samples taken at the mouth and rectum excision areas. High Rr values signify that, during respiration, the plant is releasing large amounts of active molecules known as ''free radicals,\" an indication of injury to the plant mitochondria which-if the exposure to dam- aging energies is great enough-will result in the plant's death. In fact, photographs of the grass in this case showed it to be lush and green when the animal was first dis- covered, with subsequent photographs on a return field-trip two weeks later revealing that all of the grass around the carcass had died.

A correction In the November 2000 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal, I was pleased to read Dan Wright's examina- tion of my investigation of a \"Sighting near the nation's capital.\" However, my zeal for detail led to an error in that article. Under \"Additional factor\" on page 4, EM effects are attributed to this sighting. This is an error. This sighting had no EM effects associated with it. These electrical/battery effects ac- tually occurred months earlier and were not associ- ated with a sighting. They were included only to re- flect the thought process of the witness who, in retro- spect, was wondering about them. -Joan Woodward, MUFON Field Investigator, VA"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal December 2000 Page 5 Investigative Spotlight Triangle an unknown By Dan Wright MUFON Deputy Director, Investigations Over the past few years, sightings of large, black triangular vehicles have been a staple on the Ameri- can UFO scene. The account below, initially submit- ted to the National UFO Reporting Center by a 34- year-old business manager with a degree in theology, is among the best. Perhaps one day we will learn that these were the prototype for a new U.S. military aircraft. In light of their unconventional exterior lighting and flight char- acteristics, however, we must classify them as UFOs at this point. For they are obviously structured objects, definitely airborne, and certainly unidentifiable to the general public. The Event The witness was returning home to his family from a weekend part-time job at 12:20 a.m. Monday, April 24, 2000. Driving south on busy 1-85 near Palmetto, GA, he noticed what he first assumed to be a jumbo jet on approach to Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport. As sec- onds passed, he detected a pronounced \"yaw\" to the vehicle (i.e., as with an auto seriously out of align- ment), and gauged its speed as much too slow for an airliner even if preparing to land. He also realized it was headed northwest, a course that would bypass Hartsfield, which lies to the northeast. His attention focused now, the man discerned the shape to be an isosceles triangle, the rear side being shortest. Its overall size approximated a Boeing 747, with a bluish white light at each apex and bright red \"tail lights.\" Two white strobe lights were positioned toward the rear of the underside, nearer to its center than to the corners. These flashed in unison for brief flurries. When he finally passed by the object, it appeared to be 1000-2000 feet aloft, either hovering or very slowly drifting over high-voltage power lines near a mobile home park close to the freeway. No sound was heard above that of his own auto. He proceeded south to the next exit about a mile distant, departed his car and spot- ted the object again-still prominent in apparent size, still seemingly near the trailer park. After a moment's further gaze, his view was blocked by a line of trees as the anomaly drifted slowly on its NW path toward Pal- metto. The Investigation Following Peter Davenport's alert, Georgia MUFON State Director Tom Sheets assigned Carl and Helen Thim to investigate. Their interview on May 8 included retracing the route along 1-85. The witness had already prepared a color drawing, depicting the object as it ap- proached his auto. The man remained calm, straightforward and con- sistent throughout the interview, despite opportunities to embellish. He emphasized his familiarity with air- craft from his years of living in the Hartsfield corridor and added that, as amateur astronomer, he is outside at night quite a lot. He offered the possibility of a \"black project\" military aircraft as the source. An inquiry was made to the FAA Quality Assurance Center, citing the date, time and aerial path in ques- tion. Having been assured initially that the radar tapes would be checked and a response made, the team's fur- ther queries went unanswered. Three area law enforcement agencies were contacted, but none had any record of unusual activity that night. The Thims also spoke with the manager of the mobile home court, followed up by Tom Sheets several weeks later, but no additional witnesses had come forth. The staff at a popular gas, convenience and restaurant facil- ity were likewise queried without results. One cannot completely discount the prosaic expla- nation of a commercial aircraft bending west around Atlanta for a landing on an alternate runway at Hartsfield. If so, however, its basic shape, exterior color, lighting and speed were grossly mistaken over several minutes by a passing motorist familiar with the night sky. Hall's UFO Evidence, Vol. II to be released this month The UFO Evidence, Volume II; A Thirty-Year Re- port, by Richard Hall, is being released this month by Scarecrow Press, Inc. (Cloth 0-8108-3881, 784 pages, $59.95). This publication by one of the top researchers in the UFO field reports thirty years of UFO sightings since 1964, including related data and descriptive features organized by category. It is patterned after Hall's first volume, which was published in 1964. Sightings are arranged by witness categories. Top- ics include the now strongly established patterns of UFO sightings, the growing evidence worldwide that UFOs represent someone's technology, the history of government-sponsored UFO investigtions, and politi- cal and human responses to UFO sightings.

Blackburn As our global society becomes more technological, our radiation is reaching far into space. This radiation takes the form of nuclear bursts or the transmission of high power microwave and millimeter wave radiation. We have been using high power radar and microwave equipment since the mid 1940's, and these signals have propagated out over fifty light years from earth. Should an alien species detect this radiation, they may choose to investigate its source. There may be a great deal of interest about the nature of our civiliza- tion, and they may launch interstellar probes for pur- poses of the reconnaissance and surveillance of Earth. It is likely that we may detect alien space probes many centuries before we meet any aliens. The possibility that an alien species may be send- ing space probes to our solar system always exists. However, to be taken seriously, the validity that this is actually occurring must be verifiable by tangible evidence. The proposed Optical SETI (Search for Extra-terrestrial Intelligence) concept involves the detection of alien space probes at extreme distances, with the possibility of even monitoring space beyond our solar system. These alien probes would, of course, be traveling at great speed, and sufficient thrust or energy may not be available for them to slow down as they pass Earth. As such, the Optical SETI device may represent one of the ultimate threat warning devices. It would be in the interests of the United States, and the United Na- tions, to detect these events should they come to pass. It is well known that empty space isn't completely empty, and should one of these exploratory alien probes collide with even a pebble-sized particle of in- terstellar space matter, the impact would be compa- rable to that of a nuclear detonation. Thus, an alien interstellar probe must monitor the spatial region it is about to transverse for such debris so that steps to avoid collisions can be undertaken. Once an impending collision is detected, the alien space probe would have three options. First, turn to avoid the debris; second, destroy the debris; or third, sustain the collision. Calculations indicate that at speeds of half that of light, a space probe would be given only milliseconds of warning of an impending collision, even if detection of the debris particle ex- tended outward one thousand kilometers. Meteors or meteorites are constantly bombarding About the author Dr. Blackburn, of Sunnyvale, CA, holds a doc- toral degree in Engineering Science from the Uni- versity of Mississippi and has more than thirty years of aerospace technical program manage- ment. He has been involved with research and de- velopment for Lockheed space systems since 1988, and has held numerous high-level respon- sibilities, including leadership of the IRAD pro- gram at \"Skunk Works\" for two years, Project leader of a 15-member Research and Develop- ment effort to build an expert system to optimize total performance of special hardware, and origi- nator of special prototype devices to validate ana- lytical models and predictions. A lieutenant colonel in the Air Force, he was nominated to the United States Air Force Scien- tific Advisory Board, and holds a top security clearance. our own Earth. While the density of this matter is ex- pected to diminish between stars, there is no evidence that it entirely vanishes. In fact, gaseous nebulae and interstellar dust often diminish the intensity of light from known stars. Alien space probes traveling be- tween stars must, by necessity, contend with this de- bris. What's more, to travel between even the nearby stars within reasonable times, these space probes must travel at speeds which are a large fraction of the speed of light. Consider that an alien space probe leaving Alpha Centauri-the star system closest to our own- traveling at 0.5 c, would spend 8.6 years in transit. Since these alien probes must monitor the space directly in their path and undertake either evasive ma- neuvers to avoid debris or take measures to destroy it, these activities form the basis of a means for Earth- based observers to detect the presence of these probes, as well as to determine the origin of their journey. More importantly, the means utilized by an alien probe to negate potentially hazardous collisions with interstellar debris provides a means to verify their ex- istence. Assume an alien space probe is traveling at one half the speed of light. Also assume this probe collided with a spherical silica pebble 6.2 millimeters in diam- eter (whose weight would be about 0.4 grams). This collision could yield an explosion from the resulting release of kinetic energy equivalent to that of a one kiloton nuclear detonation. To avoid impacts which would release energy equivalent to detonations the size of a one ton bomb, a mechanism would have to be able to detect particles"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal December 2000 Page 7 less than 620 microns in diameter. Even particles smaller than these would leave permanent scars.on a heavily armored space probe. Clusters of smaller par- ticles could also pose a threat. A millimeter band radar operating above 150 GHz or a LIDAR (a radar operating at optical wavelengths) seems the most likely choice for such a detection sys- tem. LIDARs are often used to detect atmospheric dust particles. Particles in the sub millimeter range lend themselves to detection by optical means rather than millimeter waves. Consequently, laser radiation may be expected to scan the space immediately in front of these interstellar space probes. Since interstellar debris cannot be expected to be at rest relative to a moving space probe, a small angu- lar volume of frontal space must be monitored for these particles. Interstellar space is expected to be usually relatively free of debris, so the only interference to LIDAR returns would be from stars (including our Sun) whose positions would be at fixed angles rela- tive to the short term motion of a space probe. Any obscured debris would have to maintain a con- stant bearing towards the alien space probe for only milliseconds for an undetected collision to occur. However, the few millisecond reaction time (based on a thousand-kilometer detection range) may be too short to permit adequate space probe reaction. A more reasonable reaction time of half a second would re- quire a detection range of 66,000 miles. A space probe moving at one fifth the speed of light will move at about a hundred miles a millisecond. Should only nearby (within five hundred miles) de- bris be of interest, distant returns could be filtered out by range-gate techniques applied to the reflected sig- nal. The trajectory of threat debris would have to be established (presumably by computer means) and cor- rective action promptly taken. This implies that a rela- tively, precise track of the debris particles must be gen- erated, and this in turn requires a laser with fairly nar- row, yet high power, pulse. The LIDAR would have to acquire about 20 pulses on a debris particle at 500 miles and display the re- sultant data on some sort of photo active surface (like a charged coupled array) so range, velocity and bear- ing angle could be determined. A burst of 20-100 pulse Doppler like pulses with a frame rate of a few milli- seconds (270 milliseconds for a 66,000-mile detec- tion range) may be one possible waveform. Both the pulse Doppler requirement and the band of narrow band optical filters would require a very stable laser, one that would not drift in wavelength with tempera- ture or age during space flight. Since the space probe is assumed to be heading to- wards our solar system, these LIDARs will likely in the angular region monitor the Earth. Earth based air- borne or orbiting telescopes could monitor the direc- tions from which the alien space probe has been pre- dicted. Detection of the LIDAR's pulsed radiation a half light year (or more) out, the destruction of a de- bris particle, or the collision with a small debris par- ticle with the space probe may be possible. Such actions are expected to continue as the inter- stellar space probe closes on our solar system. While the approaching speed of the space probe may dimin- ish, the occurrence and size of this debris, along with LIDAR signatures or debris destructions, will increase with proximity to our solar system. Alien LIDAR laser wavelengths are of immediate importance. While alien technology remains unknown to us, lasing materials are expected to remain some- what the same throughout the galaxy. Solid rather than gaseous lasers are likely the most robust (a factor of significant importance on an interstellar journey), while gas lasers are the most powerful. The wavelength variable lasers are of the least in- terest because a stable line is required so the space probe's interference filters reject interfering stellar ra- diation. Short wavelength lasers (such as fluorine or rare gas lasers with halide donors) are usually limited to about a million pulses per gas re-fill, and the need for continuous gas recharge would reduce reliability on long space journeys. Other important regions in the known spectrum may involve wavelengths of 0.266, 0.532, 0.578 and 1.06 microns. Three of these are the first, second, and fourth harmonics of the Nd:Glass laser. The 0.578 micron copper (CU) laser is another potential candidate, but it currently suffers from low power capabilities. As an alien space probe travels between its home star and our solar system, our Sun will eventually come within the region where its radiation could mask the presence of threatening debris. This is especially true in the last half light year of its journey as it nears our solar system and the velocity of debris particles be- comes a significant fraction of its velocity. As a func- tion of wavelength, solar radiation falls off slowly in the long optical wavelength region, but quickly at short wavelengths. However, these values will be strongly shifted to- wards the violet (viewed from both the alien space probe and Earth) due to Doppler shifts from relative closure velocities. Atmospheric ozone (O3), carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) may intermittently attenuate terrestrial observations. The most powerful and most promising is the CO2 laser, but its multiple line structure offers some diffi- culty. There is every reason to believe its power could be boosted even further. Then, there is the ruby"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Page 8 December 2000 MUFON UFO Journal (Cr:A12O3) and the Nd/Glass laser, offering both the stability and durability needed on a long space mis- sion. Whereas both the Sun's and debris particle's Doppler shift will be different, relativity will limit these competing effects. The ruby laser's wavelength is just above the peak in the solar spectra, and the Doppler-effect may not take it out of the Sun's peak radiation range.The best bet may be the fourth harmonic of the Nd/Glass laser if high levels of power could be generated. Otherwise, the CO2 laser may offer the best solution. Either, or both, may be a good choice for an alien debris detec- tor LIDAR. The above results may be verified by examining in- tercepted optical data from alien LIDAR (lasers) used (by them) to prevent collisions with debris during their interstellar journeys. An Optical SETI effort would involve searching for such incoming space probes by monitoring the angu- lar area about selected star systems. Nearby star sys- tems considered will be confined to those found on the SETI list of systems which could possibly support intelligent life. Even though the distances between Earth and such stars are many trillions of miles, un- manned probes and current nuclear rocket technology could cover these distances without exceeding the ve- locity of light. An aggressive Optical SETI effort would require additional study of assumptions and models for the specific LIDAR wavelengths. In addition, an evalua- tion of the incoming alien space probes would need to be undertaken, especially in terms of the velocity and trajectory, that they might utilize in order to travel from one of the selected nearby star systems to Earth. The relative velocity of Earth compared to the point of initiation of the journey is of paramount importance because the LIDAR's wavelength will be Doppler shifted to the violet as the space probe approaches Earth. Critical parameters include the following: 1) The required angular scan volume of the space probe's LIDAR 2) The possibility that the LIDAR's scan volume will encompass Earth 3) LIDAR's Wavelength 4) LIDAR's Pulse Width and Pulse Repetition In- terval. In conclusion, visitations by interstellar probes from sentient species may be anticipated or may have al- ready happened. The Optical SETI effort suggested offers a method to search for these types of probes in a systematic but low cost and low risk way. Now may the right time to begin a comprehensive Optical SETI search. Reports of triangle-shaped UFOs seem to be increasing By John F. Schuessler MUFON International Director Many people believe that unconventional flying objects should be disc shaped. Perhaps that is because the movie industry has portrayed UFOs as discs in documentaries and in sci-fi filins. Personally, I would be very surprised if all reported UFOs were of this shape. The U.S. civilian and military agencies build and fly spacecraft of various configurations. We fly air- plane-shaped, disc-shaped, spherical, cubical, cylin- drical and rectangular-shaped ones. And future space- craft may be triangular if Lockheed-Martin's Venture Star is successful. There is no reason to believe that UFO shapes wouldn't be as numerous as we find in our own spacecraft arsenal. Recently, the National Institute for Discovery Sci- ence (NIDS) web site posted statistics about 308 UFO reports coming in to the NIDS hotline. About 80% of the sightings were made between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. Only 58% of the cases were single witness events. Twenty-two percent had two witnesses, and another 20% had three or more witnesses. In eighty-four per- cent of the cases the weather was clear, with rainy weather reported in only two percent of the cases. The distribution of reported shapes is interesting, because 19% were said to be triangular/arrowhead/ pyramid/diamond-shaped, while disc/dome/cone/sau- cer-shapes were reported in 11.3% of the cases. Round/ ball/orb-shapes totaled 33.6% of the incidents. 10.1% reported a light; 9.7% a rectangle/oblong/cylinder shape; and 7.3% a football/oval/egg shape. This means that the triangular shape was the second most fre- quently reported. UFO investigator and author Bob Pratt became in- terested in the evolution in the shape of the objects as he was monitoring UFO reports in the decade of the 1980s because he noted a trend to more sightings of triangular-shaped UFOs. When the series of sightings of large triangular objects began in Belgium in 1989, Bob searched the UFO news clipping files, MUFON and CUFOS publications, and his own files to compile a fairly comprehensive listing. The oldest triangle sighting in Pratt's report dated back to 1855 over Bermuda. He found another four cases in the 1960s. Then during the mid-1970s, tri- angle sightings began to pick up, with 30 sightings reported in 1978. Even more triangle sightings were reported during the decade of the 1980s. His study ends in 1990, but we know from other sources that reports of triangles are continuing."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal December 2000 Page 9 Georgia police treated to series of sightings ByM.D. Hitt Historian, Georgia MUFON Between Oct. 20 and Oct. 26, 1967, a series of UFO sightings over the state of Georgia gained the attention of scientists and government officials. The reported objects were observed by citizens and a large number of law enforcement personnel. Of these two groups the UFOs showed a courteous behavior towards police which left officials hard pressed to explain, simi- lar to the Jan. 5, 2000, sightings by a number of po- licemen in western Illinois. . The events began on Oct. 20 at 0436 hours when Lt. James Niblett and Officer Charles Mixon, of the Milledgeville Police Department were on routine pa- trol. It is also noted that officer Mixon doubled as a Georgia Bureau Of Investigation agent. The two men were driving on state highway 22, just east of town, when they spotted a light they had not seen before. According to Lt. Niblett, \"At first, I thought it was a new street light we'd never seen before. But as we got closer it began moving away.\" The officers followed this light, which now appeared as a bright red foot- ball-shaped light, for eight miles. When they lost sight of it they turned their patrol car around and headed back to Milledgeville. Suddenly Lt. Niblett observed Officer Mixon be- come very scared and Mixon was pointing towards the rear of their car. Lt. Niblett stated, \"This object, what- ever it was, caught up with us as we approached the city. It lit the police car enough inside to make the hands on your wristwatch visible. The object appeared to be about tree top level and about the size of a large water tank. I radioed in that we were being followed by a flying object. I didn't know what it was, but it was following us.\" The officers stopped their car and got out. As soon as they looked at the object it veered away and disap- peared. After returning to the station a third officer was picked up, Patrolman J. M. Poole, and the three then drove out to a hill to search for the UFO. Later, a fourth officer, Alan Council, joined them. The four men located the object and watched it for 20 minutes. Lt. Niblett reported: \"It changed from bright red to orange and then to a bright-colored light like an elec- tric welder.\" The object then appeared to change its shape into that of a giant four-leaf clover. He added that the object, \"appeared to have a thrust, maybe an exhaust.\" While the officers were on the hilltop, Milledgeville Police Chief Eugene Ellis went to a location about half a mile away, on the Oconee River. According to re- search by the University of Arizona, \"The two groups were in radio communication when the object rose up at what Ellis estimated to be less than a quarter of a mile away from him, out of the vicinity of a pecan grove, and when first spotted was between him and a distant line of trees on higher ground a mile or so be- yond. He radioed Niblett's group to ask if they saw any- thing and they confirmed that they also observed it rising, and just then it arced over towards the south and very rapidly sped out of sight. Ellis said it appeared to be per- haps 40-50 feet across and maybe 30 feet high, seemed cylindrical comparable to an old-fashioned water tower tank (not the mushroom type, he stressed), and was glow- ing-yellow. He confirmed hearing his dispatcher say, earlier, that Warrenton, GA, PD officers were viewing an uniden- tified glowing object to their west at the same time Niblett and Mixon were viewing it to the east... when the object shot out of sight of Niblett and Mixon in the earlier part of that night, he heard Dublin PD radio that they saw it coming down from north to south, from the direction of Milledgeville. At 0505 hours, 51 miles to the northeast, police of- ficers Jack Garrison and Bill Fulmer were observing an unusual object in the sky. Officer Garrison stated: \"It was a long ways off and at first I thought it was a star. We stopped the car and the more we watched it, the more it began to change colors. It was bigger than a baseball, but I can't say just how big it was... it kept changing colors from bright red to bright green.\" Before daylight, police officers in Warrenton, Sandersville, Bowman, and Greensboro, GA, were reporting strange lights in the sky. According to the Gwinnett Dally News of Friday, Oct. 20, \"... the highway patrol station at Thompson, which coordinated the reports, said it had been advised the object was a weather bureau balloon drifting at 117,000 feet with flashing red, green, and white lights. The U. S. Weather Bureau in Atlanta, however, said it had no knowledge of such a balloon and said weather balloons normally have only a small red light on them. The Atlanta Flight Service, which would issue warn- ings to pilots in such events, said it had no reports on a weather balloon. Highway patrol radio operator Robert L. Stevens Jr., at Thomson, said the unidentified flying object had been reported to Warner Robins Air Force Base for investigation.\" On Saturday morning, Oct. 21, Fayetteville citizen William A. Mathis was driving to work when he ob-"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Page 10 December 2000 MUFON UFO Journal served a white object in the sky; heading in'the direc- tion of Newnan, GA. \"The object was surrounded by a luminous ring and was followed by a trail of light. I thought it was a falling star.\" At 0130 hours on Sunday, Oct. 22, Highway patrol- man Jerry Goldin at the mountaintop Manchester state patrol station, observed two strange lights. One was described as an ice blue ball about a mile high and a yellow and red rectangle about a hundred yards above the trees. He then radioed Larry Whitlock, the Fayetteville night policeman, about the UFOs. Officer Whitlock related that at 0330 hours he observed the two objects in the sky. \"One was over Senoia, while the other was in the direction of Griffin.\" . Newnam Patrolman Dale Spradlin and Gerald Masdon were on routine patrol at 0430 hours on Oct. 22 when they were involved in an unusual event Of- ficer Masdon reported that he and his partner Spradlin \"heard about the object from the state patrol radio about 1:30 a.m. Sunday, but didn't actually see anything un- til about 4:30 a.m. We had almost forgotten about hear- ing about it until we were patrolling south on Greenville Street and saw this light off to the east. : \"I don't know what it was, and we have never said it was a flying saucer. I saw a light that moved all around and I've got no idea what it was. We pulled into a car dealer's lot so we could get a better look. The light was over to the east beyond a railroad bank. At the time, it seemed about the height of the bank, but we couldri't tell how far away it was. We left the lot and went to where we could get a line of bearing on the light by marking it with a building and then we started toward it. \"We followed it about eight miles out-of-town east on Poplar road. We came to a state patrol car, and we turned around. I was driving and Spradlin was watch- ing the light through the back window. It seemed to get higher like it was gaining on us-that's when he reported it was gaining on us. It was a bright light and looked a lot like one of these mercury vapor larrips- with a sort of bluish glow. The object was traveling above tree-top level.\" Officer Masdon was at this time traveling 75 miles per hour to get away. According to Officer Spradlin, a girl and a boy parked at a lake watched the chase and said, \"It seemed to be right above us, about tree top high.\" The same officer added, \"When it caught up with the car, it beamed down a bluish light that illuminated the whole roadway, then zoomed up into the sky.\" Three Newnan police units, Coweta County officers, and police from Talbotton, Taylor County, and Lafayette watched the object until dawn. Officers re- ported that by that time the object had climbed high into the sky, looking like a bright star except for its erratic movements. Then it disappeared. Before daylight, officers at Warm Springs, Greenville, Perry, Dublin, Macon, and Americus, GA, were observing strange flying objects. At 1400 hours, 10 miles north-west of Newnan, Whitesburg, GA, citizen Mack Long had an unusual encounter which was witnessed by his brother-in-law. Mr. Long lived three miles north of Whitesburg on Highway 5. He was taking some trash to a dump pile in his backyard when the incident occurred. Mr. Long stated, \"I was just standing there and I heard something that sounded like a swarm of bees.,, When I looked up I saw the thing, and it took off. It was sort of a brown color with red spots and about the size of a tire rim. There couldn't have been anyone in. that thing, it was too small. When I looked up the thing took off through the woods, turning sideways between. trees and it sure was traveling fast.\" Mr. Long watched the object as it shot through the sky and then he observed it going down in between some nearby hills. A search was made by Mr. Long and some other men, but nothing was found. At about the same period of time an incident report- edly occurred in Milledgeville involving a 13-year- old boy. He told his mother he was going out into the woods to hunt for UFOs. He grabbed his BB gun and Polaroid Swinger camera and set out. After playing a while in one of his favorite places, he reportedly looked up and observed a slow moving object. Two pictures were taken and then the object started to go higher into the sky. Just then his friends started calling up to him. The 13-year-old started calling back. By now the object was picking up speed and moving out of sight. When his friends arrived the object was gone. Later that night and 15 miles northwest of Atlanta, C.L. Curry of Mableton, along with several persons in the area, including a policeman, observed what ap- peared to be revolving prisms darting around the sky. The objects were watched for four hours. Mr. Curry stated, \"There are two of them, and I see them quite plainly... the objects appeared shortly after dark and moved up and down, closer and away.\" At 0530 hours, on Monday, Oct. 23, a UFO was again seen over Milledgeville. After reports of the UFO were called in by Baldwin County Sheriff s officers, a Cessna aircraft was sent up to catch the object. The pilot reportedly had some 4000 hours of flying time and flew Forest Service patrols for the County For- estry Commission. With him went a companion, for- mally with the County Sheriffs Department. They were in radio contact with the Milledgeville airport, and through the airport with the sheriffs officers on the ground with walkie-talkies, as well as with the radar"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal December 2000 Page 11 operator at the Flight Control Center. According to research scientists from the University of Colorado, Dr. Roy Craig and John Ahrens, \"The pilot said when they first started looking for the objects, they were look- ing low, near the ground. One light they spotted proved to be a yard light. They couldn't find the object at first. Ground observers then got word to them that it was behind them-they had passed it. They turned back, still looking low, when the word came \"it's above you.\" They had seen a light above before, but hadn't paid any attention to it, apparently assuming it was a star. Now they did see the object, and started chasing it. \"When we flew directly towards it, it backed off, decreasing in size and so it was only about the size of the head of the pencil. We went up to about 3500 feet, but it kept moving higher and away from us.\" The pilot was strongly impressed with the great de- crease in the size of the object as it receded from the plane. When he first spotted the object, it appeared to him half to two-thirds the size of the moon. It decreased to a fraction of its original size. They gave up the chase about 6 a.m. He said the color of the object was a con- stant brilliant white: As they returned to Milledgeville, the object moved back to about its original position, and was still there when they landed. The air chase was picked up by an ASR-5 radar, which would make 10 or 12 sweeps per minute. Re- searchers from the University of Colorado reported the following: \"Recorded conversation between the pilots and the Flight Control radar operator indicated the pi- lot was chasing a UFO, which he said had risen from the river area below and was now moving away from him. The radar operator said he had a target on the scope, which he assumed to be the plane. He also said he had a second target, seen intermittently for a dura- tion of about one minute. The pilot was heading at 110 degrees directly towards object. This direction seemed to be consistent with the assumption that the second target was the chased UFO. The sightings had many explanations. At first the objects were thought to be a weather balloon, as stated by the Highway Patrol station at Thomson. The U.S. Weather Bureau, in Atlanta heard this explanation and quickly ruled it out. Then four days later and after a GBI agent had been involved in a sighting, Maj. Barney Ragsdale, head of the Georgia Bureau of Investiga- tion, quoted a report filed by Lt. H. M. Spurlin of McRae, GBI supervisor for district three. Maj. Ragsdale stated, \"Spurlin said several weeks ago he discovered a group of teenaged boys who were putting candles in blue plastic bags, like those on finished laun- dry, and setting them aloft. When they hit the wind currents, they really go. It's almost frightening to see them.\" No plastic bags, with candles inside them, were reported or found by any- one involved in the Georgia sightings. Then the scientists, funded on a federal level, put forth the following explanations: \"Venus, plus sugges- tion, and unfettered imagination, might account for most, perhaps all, of the UFO reports in this series. Ju- piter was also involved in some of the reports. Sleepi- ness and fatigue also could have been significant fac- tors, since some police officers involved had been working double shifts. The case illuminates the inad- equacy of current evaluation regarding fundamental astronomy and atmospheric physics.\" As for the radar return, the operator was questioned many times and after a while grew tired of the Colo- rado researchers. He became harder to contact and fi- nally he left word at his workplace stating he wasn't as sure he had seen a second target. That ended that. The photos were also explained away. According to the University of Colorado investigators, \"It is believed that the object photographed had no relation to the object pursued in the pre-dawn activity.\" Scientists at the University of Arizona Atmospheric Physics Department disagreed. Dr. James E. McDonald looked into the Georgia cases and, after talking with the witnesses, ruled the \"Venus\" explanation out. It was felt the investigators from Colorado were over- looking the facts. Dr. McDonald wrote to a fellow col- league on March 6, 1969: \"Do you concur that if it leaked out that we were finding strongly contradictory case-information on particular CU investigations, some crucial sentences or paragraphs might be shaded and altered before R-day? My views on conspiracy hypoth- eses would certainly take me that far.\" MUFON MUGS Official MUFON ceramic mugs with blue logo, $8.00, plus $3.50 S&H. MUFON, P.O. Box 369, Morrison, CO 80465-0369.

I noticed your e-mail said you'd seen a UFO 'capture?' military jets in New Mexico. Sounds like an important incident. Could you write that up?\" \"Allow me to clarify,\" I replied. \"There were eight military jets in on the search and pursue, only one of which vanished in front of me! I filed a report with NICAP after it happened (about September 1965), but I'm told the report probably disappeared with a lot of other NlCAP files when that organization folded in the 1970s.\" I knew I wouldn't have to concentrate very much to remember the details of the incident which had shocked my 16-year old brain so long ago. It was early to middle June 1965, and my family and I were on vacation out of Tampa, FL. We stopped at Bottomless Lakes State Park, just east of Roswell, NM. And yes, folks, that's Roswell, NM, some 20 years before the general public (me included) knew there was anything special about Roswell. At night the lights of Roswell and Walker Air Force Base could be seen to the west, and our first night was one of those magnificently clear desert evenings. Hav- ing been an amateur astronomer since I was ten, I was in Seventh Heaven! While I owned a 3-inch Newtonian reflector telescope, all I had with me was a pair of 7x50 binoculars. So there I sat, at about 2230 hours, in a folding chaise lounge just looking at the stars. I had taken the binoculars from my eyes to select another celestial object to view when I noticed what looked like a satellite moving toward me. As it passed directly overhead, I zeroed in on it with my binocu- lars. I continued to watch as it moved directly be- tween two small stars and stopped dead between them! It didn't slow; it just stopped and hung there, dead still, for several seconds. Then it went out, as if someone had turned off a light switch. Only then did I realize it could not possibly be a satellite, because it had been moving from east to west- directly opposite the normal path of a satellite. (This was more than 20 years before satellites were launched into retrograde orbit.) Not only was the object going in the wrong direc- tion, but it had suddenly stopped in its tracks. Satel- lites don't do that. Nor could it have been any terres- trial aircraft of the period. It moved too fast for a bal- loon and then stopped dead-neither balloons nor air- craft can stop that abruptly without some preliminary slowing. Also, there was no aircraft noise. This last point was brought home to me even more forcefully less than 15 minutes later when I began hear- ing the sound of jets in the area. I removed the binocu- lars from my eyes and spotted at least four pairs of air- craft sweeping back and forth across the sky, perform- ing what looked to me like a search pattern. Two pairs of the aircraft were running opposing search tracks far to the north of the campground, and one pair was to the south. The fourth pair was moving west to east, directly above the northern edge of the campground. These two headed east and turned 180° to come back west, directly over my position. As soon as I realized they were heading directly over me, and would be turning to head through the area where the mysterious object had disappeared, I put my binoculars on them and watched. I never lost sight of them as they made their 180° turn and came back. They were obviously military jet fighter planes, if for no other reason than they were flying in classic two- plane elements. Through the binoculars, I could see the red and green navigation lights on each aircraft. I could also see the orange glow of the extremely close- mounted twin jet exhausts headed away from me just before turning about and heading through the area where the UFO had stopped and disappeared. I'll call it a \"UFO\" from here on, because that is what it was-uni- dentified and flying. As this pair of aircraft passed through where the UFO had disappeared, the wingman (to the right rear of the element leader) flew directly through the point where the UFO had vanished, and he vanished as well! I was watching through the binoculars, and the wingman dis- appeared as if someone had flipped a switch-no navi- gation lights and no engine exhaust! The element leader flew on for perhaps one or two miles before he (apparently) noticed his wingman was gone. Then his afterburners bloomed and he dove straight for Walker Air Force Base at full burner, straight in, with no approach circle! I looked up and saw all six of the other aircraft do exactly the same thing. They lit their burners and dove directly for Walker AFB. Forget the approach pattern! Within five minutes there wasn't a plane left in the sky! I followed the element leader all the way down to the western horizon and then tried to find the wingman who had disappeared. He did not reappear. I never saw that aircraft re-light its engines, nor did I see the obvious telltale explosion of an aircraft crash. At this point, a discussion of what types of aircraft may have been involved is in order. The very close-set twin jet exhausts of these aircraft (so close-set that they had a \"double barrel\" engine arrangement) gives us a clue as to what they were. Only a limited number of"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal December 2000 Page 13 US Air Force fighter types with that particular engine configuration existed in 1965. We can rule out US Navy fighters, as they would not be expected to be present in these numbers (two flights or eight aircraft) as far inland as Roswell. The single-seat Northrop F-5 \"Tiger II\" was an \"export\" fighter, and the only F-5 unit at the time was based just outside Phoenix, AZ, where foreign pilots were trained in day fighter and ground attack operations; they would not have been flying at night. The two-seat, subsonic, Northrop F-89 \"Scorpion\" interceptor had, with its unswept wing, been completely relegated to the Air National Guard in 1961. and whereas a few may have still been around in 1965, I think it unlikely. The McDonnell F-101 \"Voodoo\" was, on the other hand, an operational, supersonic, two- seat, interceptor in 1965. The only other candidate aircraft would be the two- seat McDonnell F-4 \"Phantom\" that later won fame in Vietnam. The twin-engined General Dynamics F-l 11 \"Aardvark\" didn't reach service until 1967. There- fore, these eight aircraft were most likely either F-4 \"Phantom\" air superiority fighters or F-101 \"Voodoo\" interceptors. A check of Walker AFB inventory circa 1965 would answer the question. I hasten to point out that the F-101, F-4, and even the F-5 share a common aerodynamic characteristic critical to this discussion-they all have the glide ratio of a brick! For that reason, I seriously doubt the van- ished wingman simply suffered a power failure (lost both engines and electrical power for his navigation lights), which would have made it difficult for me to see him, and then glided all the way to Walker, mak- ing a \"dead stick\" landing. Furthermore, the actions of his element leader and the other aircraft argue strongly against any sort of simple power failure to account for the disappearance of the wingman. I don't think they were simply ordered back to base. Had they been, they would have entered the normal approach pattern in an orderly fashion. Instead, they scrambled toward the safety of good old \"mother earth\" at full burner and to hell with the landing pattern! Apparently, the complete disappearance of their com- patriot without a trace had scared them spitless. It was just after 2300 hours and, I'd estimate, a good 10 minutes after all aircraft had cleared the sky, when I called it a night and went to bed. I saw no further sign of either the UFO or the missing aircraft before I went inside...and there is no way the aircraft could have glided that long! What happened to that aircraft near Roswell in 1965? Occasionally, even now, more than 30 years after the incident, I wake up at night with that very burning ques- tion in my mind. Seeing a jet fighter simply vanish before my eyes is something I'll never forget. Does Utah spraying have a tie-in with 'chemtranV? An article in the Oct. 21 edition of the Salt Lake Tribune entitled \"Studies Probe Weather, Terrorism,\" stated: \"Federal government scientists are conducting two different atmospheric studies in Salt Lake City this month. Both will look at how air and particles flow in the atmosphere, but their data is being used to study two different Utah phenomena: weather inversions and the Olympics. \"One study is part of the Department of Energy's (DoE) Chemical and Biological National Security pro- gram, whose goal is to develop and improve systems the United States can use to respond to chemical and biological attacks. In this study, a nontoxic, inert tracer chemical called sulphur hexafluoride is being released into the skies above Salt Lake City. \"Monitoring and sensing equipment are tracking the chemical to determine wind patterns, temperature and moisture patterns and how air is mixed in lower and midle vels of the atmosphere. \"The Department of Defense's (DoD) Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is supporting this study and may use information from it for the 2002 Winter Olympics DTRA, which is responsible for pro- tecting the United States and its allies from weapons of mass destruction. \"It would use the information to assist police, fire and military personnel in the event of an attack in- volving nuclear, chemical or biological weapons or a large chemical accident, said Capt. Bob Bennett, spokesman for the agency. The study will be conducted through much of this month.\" Ron Regehr, Utah state co-director, contacted sev- eral ufologists concerning this report, noting, \"The co- operative effort between the DoE and the DoD to re- lease sulphur hexafluoride into the skies above Salt Lake City is ostensibly an effort to gather data to com- bat potential terrorism. The article claims SF6 is 'non- toxic' and 'inert.' \"What is missing?\" asks Regehr. \"SF6 is a gas now recognized as one of the world's worst greenhouse gases. Because of its high chemical stability, it remains in the upper atmosphere of the Earth much longer than carbon dioxide. In addition to it's debilitating effect on the upper atmosphere, it is potentially harmful to those with upper-respiratory problems. \"According to International Chemical Safety Cards ICSC: 0571, sulphur hexafluoride can be absorbed into the body by inhalation.

Triangle sightings LONG ISLAND—Betty LaRosa writes that her friend who is quite shy, tells her of frequent sightings of triangle-shaped objects which fly overjust before dawn. She lives on the South Shore of Long Island near the inland waters before entering the Atlantic Ocean. She says they are always traveling in a southerly or south- westerly direction. They are barely visible, but their forms appear to be triangular with white lights on two sides and a red light in the center of the craft. They make no sound, and ap- pear to travel in groups of three to five craft. Thanks to Betty LaRosa. Note: We have frequent reports of uni- dentified craft over Long Island, so if you are in the area keep looking up.

I noticed an aircraft flying west close to the Dayton airport. I'm 5 minutes away from the airport here. Something struck me about this aircraft because it's position lights didn't look right: Besides the normal flashing red and green, there were two steady orange looking lights on both wings. \"I've never seen this type of light formation before: I got my binoculars out and sure enough this aircraft was spraying a thick trail of what has been video taped and seen before.

The report revealed that one individual spotted a dark triangular object float- ing silently above him while he was standing by his pickup. \"The hunter said he and his three buddies were in a dry camp, so alcohol couldn't be blamed for what he and two of the others saw. The man indicated that as he approached his pickup at about 9:45 p.m., he 'got a feel- ing of a thick, heavy blanket above me and chills down my spine.' He said he shined his flashlight on the 'dark triangular object floating directly above us and our camp trailer.' \"The man fell into profane disbelief and then called out for his buddies to come see for themselves. He said he could see rounded dark edges and a flat bottom that had a texture like suede leather and was colored gold-gray.

V-shaped craft in North Dakota SOUTH WEST, ND—David Fugere reports, \"I had a sighting similar to the Woodlands Oct. 26, sighting at 9:00 p.m. I saw the formation of circular white lights on the bottom of the craft, but wouldn't call them lights in the usual way of thinking about lights. \"I can best describe these .lights by a glow in the dark toy. If you take one of these toys and light it up good and then put it in a dark room and let it dim down for a while you got the lighting that I saw. \"I'd be curious to know if this person could relate to that as I'm quite convinced we saw the same thing. My craft too had six lights on each side, but did not line up perfectly with the ones on the other side.

I was looking straight up when it popped up over my house. I doubt if it was any higher than 300 feet. I could not make out any solid structure in between the lights, even when I got my binoculars on them. \"It flew southwest over our town for at least 15 sec- onds.

As he descended the mountain, he saw the object was hovering over the town of Deming. Todd noticed that it changed shape from time to time. Most of the time, the object kept a short cylinder shape, and periodically changed to a wedge shape. Todd watched the object for about 30 minutes; He said, \"At one point, I even pulled to the side of the road so as to pay more attention to the thing.\" After about 30 min- utes, the object changed to a flat shape and moved up vertically for about three seconds and then just van- ished.

Pilots report cylinder in California San Francisco—Field investigator Chris Altman reports that on Oct. 21. 2000, a United Airlines pilot who does not want his name released at this point was bringing his 737 Boeing aircraft into San Francisco at about 3 p.m. when he and twenty other witnesses saw a large* cylindrical object pace the plane for about 12 minutes. The plane was about 35 miles out of San Francisco when the pilot observed a large object about 1 mile away on the port side of the plane, which was at about 15,000 feet at the time of the sighting. The object was 45 degrees low on the port side. It was estimated to be about 300 feet long, very dark in color, and clearly had no windows on it. After about 10 minutes, the object rose very rapidly to a point where it was about 2000 feet over them. Then after 2 more minutes it shot up and out of sight. The Air Traffic Control stated to the pilot that they had nothing on radar other than the 737. Other wit- nesses are being contacted, as someone took photos and video tape of the object. The pilot also told me that he noticed that many instruments fluctuated when the craft rose by them. Thanks to Chris Altman. F-15 encounter described Nick Balaskas writes, \"My friend Michael DeRobertis and the F-15 pilot who had the experience with a UFO don't have any good explanations for this strange encounter. Michael allowed me to share this UFO incident with you.\" Michael writes, \"The wingman was flying an F-15 single-seat fighter on a mockup aerial combat mission of two planes. His leader was flying a two-seater F-15. They were entering downwind for landing at about noontime, and he was following his leader about a mile back at 2500 feet at 250 knots. It was a sunny day, no clouds, and visibility unlimited. \"When he was looking at his leader, he saw a bright yellow spot on the ground or near the ground. The light then started to rise, apparently toward the leader. Be- fore he had a chance to warn him, he realized it was moving towards him. When it got close, it passed from the front window to the side left window, and passed a few hundred meters away (very close in aviation terms). It then continued to \"fly continuously in the opposite direction while climbing. \"The object was round, with a bright yellow circle of lights on top. Its surface was metal-like, with sil- ver-platinum color. It left no trails or fumes behind. \"He estimated that it was doing some 300 knots"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Page 16 December 2000 MUFON UFO Journal when it passed him. The whole thing lasted 15 to 20 seconds. It did not look like any known aircraft or a missile! The pilot was so stunned that he did nothing. As a trained and veteran fighter pilot, he admits that he should have retracted his gear, gone to afterburn- ers, and chased it! But he admits that he was shocked to his bones. When he reached debriefings, he talked to his leader. The guy saw nothing-he was already preparing for landing and watching the runway on his right. \"However, the back-seat guy did see something, but only that some yellow lights passed them on the left and below. The next thing he did, was to call his friend from the Air Force, and ask him if he has any explana- tion.

The five-foot pear-shaped piece of silver metal was first spotted hurtling towards the ground by Jenny Cook in Hendon on Tuesday morn- ing. Police launched an inquiry following the report by the 18-year-old Sunderland University student, but despite a ground search of the area, failed to find any trace of the object. The Echo has now learned that officials at Newcastle Airport were alerted after a similar sighting three hours later above Penshaw. Ron Atwill spotted a mysteri- ous five-foot long gray object that narrowly missed a passenger jet as it made its descent towards Newcastle Airport. Mr. Atwill, a retired prison service worker, saw the object at 11:45 a.m. He said, \"I was looking up as a passenger jet was flying quite low in the distance and I saw this thing almost hit it. I rang the airport to see if they might have spotted it. It was about 20 feet away from the plane. It was a silvery gray and very flat, pear shaped and about four to five feet long. Detective Inspector John Watts, of Sunderland City Center Police, said, \"We had a report of a strange ob- ject in .the skies about the size of a small car.\" Diamond-shaped object in Connecticut SOUTHINGTON - On Tuesday, Oct. 31,2000, Ha- zel A. Eisenberg reports a very bright UFO with a dia- mond shape at one end was spotted at 7:30 p.m. \"Seven of my friends were watching the UFO as I got out of the car and pointed it out to me. jt moved very quickly, and then suddenly stopped on a dime. It then hovered and then changed altitude very quickly. We all dis- missed it and went on with our plans. I didn't give it a second thought until I read about the sighting in Middletown, and it was exactly what we saw. I think this is very cool.\" Thanks to Larry Clark nymufon@nycap.rr.com Egg-shaped object in Ohio CYGNET—NUFORC reports it has received sev- eral reports from several states in the Midwest about this Oct. 31,2000, incident. An egg-shaped ship crossed the sky, stopped, shot up about a half mile, hovered for awhile, and changed to a multitude of colors and departed. A witness, a teacher, reported sighting the object at 7:15 p.m. as the witness and companions were travel- ing north on 1-75 just south of Cygnet. The object, which looked like a meteor, came across the horizon from the east and out of space. It crossed over 1-75 heading west, then an explosion or emission of some kind illuminated the craft. This event did not look like an explosion proper, but rather an orange, yellow and a sparkling gold bolt of lighting with many branches! It came to a quick stop. One of the witnesses grabbed a video camera, but the battery was dead. Through binoculars they saw a flash of white light, then the object moved up half a mile, staying there until the witnesses got to the Cyg- net Road exit. The object was hovering a hundred feet above the trees, so the witnesses pulled over and stopped. A woman stopped her car in front of them and asked if they saw the UFO. The witnesses exchanged names and agreed to meet later. The UFO was dimming, get- ting brighter, and then turning a multitude of colors, including red, blue, green, white, magenta and yellow. The witnesses moved closer, and it became an intense red, and that's when the witnesses decided to leave. \"I don't like the way that this is looking!\" said one of the witnesses. \"The lights on the Jeep started to dim and brighten and then dim again and we drove away as fast as we could. We kept an eye on it and went back to meet up with the woman witness.\" Later both men developed a pain in their abdominal region right below the rib cage. The abdomen was in- flamed and red.

Filer Director, MUFON Eastern Region Tom Carey writes that a correction should be made on the message held in Gen. Ramey's hand and photo- graphed by J. Bond Johnson on July 8, 1947. Dave Rudiak' s line #4, which is a key line to the message, should read: « **** 5*8 IN THE \"DISK\" THEY WILL SHIP FOR A1-8TH ARMY AF**\" The key phrase here is \"in the disk\" referring to something that was inside, as well as to where it was being shipped to Gen. Ramey who is the A-l at Ft. Worth. Dave Rudiak is \"absolutely certain\" that the memo was addressed to Gen. Hoyt S. Vandenberg at the Pen- tagon, who at the time was deputy chief of the Army Air Force. With the new scan, Rudiak was able to make out several letters in Vandenberg' s name above Ramey's thumb. This ties in neatly with the following statement on page 57 of The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell by Randle and Schmitt concerning Gen. Vandenberg: \"The Associated Press reported that Lieutenant Gen- eral Hoyt S.

Signed Ramey I wish to thank researchers Dave Rudiak, Tom Carey, Don Schmitt, Don Burleson, Neil Morris, and the Roswell Photo Interpretation Team for making new evidence available to us. Vandenberg was Deputy Commander, US Army Air Forces, in 1947. Later he became Air Force Chief of Staff. A review of his official daily activities calendar revealed that he returned from Wichita Falls, TX, on July 5,1947, less than a hundred miles from Ft. Worth. On Monday, July 7, Gen. Vandenberg's diary is full of UFO reports, and he spends most of the day taking care of a flying saucer recovery in Houston, TX, an incident that he later claims was a hoax. One entry sticks out. He asked Gen. Van what he thought the flying discs were, and Gen. Van replied, \"Some National Guard planes were put on duty on their own volition to search for the discs, but no planes have been put on duty from Hq. AAF.\" On Tuesday, July 8, Col. Blanchard announced to the world press that a flying saucer had been captured near Roswell, NM. Late in the afternoon J. Bond Johnson took Gen. Ramey's photograph in Fort Worth with a copy of the message apparently just sent to Vandenberg in his hand. Vandenberg's diary reports he returned from Con- gressman Wolverton's office at 5:07 p.m. and went immediately to Secretary of the Army Air Force Symington's Office with reference to personnel for the President's Air Board. At 6:20 p.m. he went to Mr. Leo's office and then home. It is not known what the President's Air Board was. He should have received Ramey's message by then or first thing Wednesday. On Wednesday, July 9, Gen. Vandenberg's diary reports he talked with Gen. Doolittle on the phone and told him to come in at 10:30 a.m. He met with Symington arid apparently with Doolittle at 10:30. At 10:50 he met with Gen. Eisenhower, Army Chief of Staff, and Gen. Norstad, Psychological Operations. At 12:15 he met again with Symington. At 12:15 Vanden- berg is told to be at the White House the next day. His diary also says that at 2:15 p.m. Vandenberg returned from JCS (Joint Chief of Staffs) and met again with Symington. At 3:40 he met with Gen. Gardner, Gen. Power, and Col. Peterson. He does not mention handling the UFO situation, but Gen. Doolittle is known to have investigated UFO sightings in Sweden. Gen. Vandenberg's diary indicates he met with vir- tually all key military personnel in Washington, DC, and that something very important was happening. It should be noted that Vandenberg is concerned that the Air Force was becoming a separate service in a few weeks, and he was attempting to obtain funding for 70 Groups. Congress appeared to be cutting the Air Force to only 55 groups; Publicizing the new possible threat from UFOs could help increase Air Force funding. The message stating that there were both victims of the wreck and shipping a disk speaks volumes."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Page 18 December 2000 MUFON UFO Journal The UFO PRESS Passport to the Cosmos by John E. Mack, M.D.; Crown, New York, 1999; 7X10 hardback, 306 pages, $24.00 (Available from PEER, P.O. Box 398080, Cambridge, MA 02139). Reviewed by Dwight Connelly Dr. Mack, a recognized leader in abduction research, continues to expand his perspectives in this important book, taking up where he left off vi\\\\hAbduction (1994), his first book in this contentious field. It was Abduction which caused Mack's colleagues at Harvard University to question his scholarship, despite his stat- ure as the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of A Prince of Our Dis- order (a biography of T. E. Lawrence), as well as other im- pressive credentials. Apparently those stalwarts of academic free- dom at Harvard were uncomfort- able with extending this concept into the realm of abduction re- search, but Dr. Mack did prevail- at least in keeping his position as professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School. This latest book does nothing to mollify those who feel that Dr. Mack, the founding director of the Program for Extraordinary Expe- rience Research (PEER), has gone off the deep end in his re- search and conclusions. He questions the usual con- cepts of reality, and espouses what he calls \"a world view,\" incorporating not only the cultures of other nations, but also suggesting that there may be a material world and an immaterial world. Like some other researchers who have moved from the nuts and bolts to something approaching the spirit realm, Dr. Mack has gone where his research, his intellect, and his feelings have taken him. But unlike some other \"researchers\" who might be con- sidered on the fringe of ufology, Dr. Mack provides a very careful, step by step analysis of his findings and con- clusions,-and even points out that nuts and bolts research still has its place. He concludes, however: \"It seems to me possible that the matters under consideration here will not yield their secrets to the methodologies of science that were evolved to explore phenomena that were accepted as existing entirely within the material world.\" He adds, \"This is not to say that careful methods of observation and analysis should not be applied to the physical aspects of the alien abduction phenomenon. Yet the investigations of UFO photographs, radar records, missing persons and pregnancies following abductions, reported, observations of strange beings, burned earth patches where UFOs presumably landed, bodily lesions and so-called implants removed from experiencers' bodies after abductions, and all the other physical signs associated with the phenomenon have been relentlessly accompanied by such discrepancies and difficulties in finding certainty or proof that even the most committed explorers have fre- quently turned against each other with revelations or accusations of insufficient or bogus credentials and cries of hoax, while the doubt- ful have tended to dismiss the whole matter as hallucination or the paranoid delusion of true be- lievers.\" He explains, \"It is the experi- ences themselves, and our-the experiencers' and my-estimate of their reality that is our principal source of data in determining the truth of what has taken place. What I have been finding has been, according to my own back- ground, not 'possible.' Yet from the standpoint of my clinical ex- perience and judgment, it does in- deed appear in some way to be true. \"In that sense the phenomenon might be described as an anomaly- that is, an occurrence that is as bizarre as reports of rocks we now call meteorites falling from the sky seemed in the eighteenth century-not possible according to the science of the times, but may nevertheless turn out to be real in some way that we do not yet understand.\" Dr. Mack says he \"was faced with the choice of either trying to fit these individuals' reports into a framework that fit my worldview-they were having fantasies, strange dreams, delusions, or some other distortion of reality-or of modifying my worldview to include the possibility that entities, beings, energies-something-could be reaching my clients from another realm. The first choice was com- patible with my worldview, but did not fit the clinical data. The second was inconsistent with my philosophical grounding, and with conventional assumptions about real- ity, but appeared to fit better what I was finding. It seemed to me to be more logical, and intellectually more honest,"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal December .2000 Page 19 to modify my cosmology than to continue trying to force my clients into molds that clearly did not suit them.\" Dr. Mack recognizes that the investigator plays a key role in the information which comes from the experiencer. \"The orientation and ideology of the investigator, and the questions he or she asks or does not ask, will determine to some degree what data can be enabled or allowed to come forth, and will affect profoundly the interpretation of the experiences,\" he says. \"Furthermore, abductees select consciously and un- consciously to whom they turn to tell their stories. And to make matters still more complex, the phenomenon itself seems to change and evolve according to the state or level of consciousness of the experiencer and the facilitator with whom he or she is working. But al- lowing for these variables, it does nevertheless seem possible to distinguish certain essential elements.\" The basic element, says Dr. Mack, is the abduction experience itself-typically the person is aware of an unusual amount of light, taken from a car or bed or whatever, transported (perhaps through :something solid) by entities to some sort of curved enclosure, gazed at by large eyes, subjected to some type of medi- cal procedure, perhaps receives implants, perhaps is shown hybrids who are to eventually inherit the Earth, perhaps is given the idea they have been specially se- lected, and is then returned to the locale where he or she was abducted. In looking at the hybrid \"project\" noted above, Dr. Mack says, \"To the abductees themselves, as well as to some investigators, these hybrids exist quite mate- rially and literally. The experiences may be altogether real from the standpoint of consciousness, but the hy- brid offspring might not exist in material reality as we know it, especially as no clear physical evidence for their literal existence in this dimension has been found.\" This, as Dr. Mack notes, is not the conclusion of such abduction researchers as Dr. David Jacobs, who suggests the hybrids are not only real, but will eventu- ally .take over the Earth. The second dimension to the abduction phenom- enon, according to Dr. Mack, involves the transmis- sion of information from the entities to the experiences. This takes various forms, including tele- pathic transmission, field trips, images on TV-like monitors, and the use of the large eyes of the entities. The subject matter may range from ecology and sav- ing the Earth from pollution to knowledge of healing and spiritual truths. The experiencer may not know what to do with the new knowledge, but feels it is pro- found. The third dimension to the abduction phenomenon, says Dr. Mack, \"might be defined as 'consciousness expanding,' 'growth engendering,\" or 'spiritual.' He con- tinues, \"There is a good deal of confusion in the abduction research field surrounding the word spiritual. How, some argue, can a phenomenon that is so clearly traumatic for many people, one that seems to disregard wishes, feel- ings, and morality, be spiritual in the sense of coming from a higher source? Some experiences are even left with external and possibly internal organ scarring, as well as lasting conscious and unconscious fears and phobias. Should not spiritual experiences be benign, largely uplift- ing, or directly enlightening? Yet we know that some ex- periences, such as life-threatening illnesses, tragic losses, and other personal crises, are often catalysts for profound personal growth and transformation.\" The fourth dimension to the abduction phenomenon, says Dr. Mack, involves \"the evolution of the human/ alien relationship. The experience of connection be- tween one or more of the alien beings and the abductees with whom they relate is such a powerful and consis- tent aspect of the phenomenon that I have come to perceive it as one of its basic elements. The relation- ships vary, of course, according to the sort of alien (and probably human) involved. The gray reptilian beings seem to be more trauma-inducing, at least ini- tially, than the light or human-appearing beings.\" Passport to the Cosmos is organized into an intro- ductory chapter followed by four parts: part one deals with how we might look at the phenomenon, how we might study it, the nature of reality, and the energetic elements that accompany abductions. Part two looks at the implications of the abduction phenomenon re- lated to the ecology of the planet and the future of life on Earth. Part three considers \"the deep symbolic struc- tures of thought and meaning that appear to be a regu- lar and important aspect of the abduction phenomenon for experiences and how the experiences are reported by three native healers.\" Part four deals with \"the fur- ther meaning and power of the encounters for the experiences and their implications for human con- sciousness.\" This is a book written by an extremely intelligent and well-educated individual who has not been afraid to go where his research and experiences have taken him, and who admits that he does not have all the an- swers. Whether he is correct or incorrect in his tenta- tive conclusions, we must respect his efforts to under- stand what may not be understandable, and admire his courage in taking on this difficult challenge when he could have led the easier life of a traditional Harvard professor. Anyone interested in the abduction phenomenon should read Passport to the Cosmos. It is a key book which should be in the library of every serious ufologist."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Page 20 December 2000 MUFON UFO Journal Perspective By Richard Hall Richard Hall On ET Versus Other Theories It is much the rage these days for rank newcomers who apparently know very little about UFO history to post silly questions, not to mention silly \"answers,\" on the internet about \"classic\" or well-known UFO cases from the 1940s, 1950s, or 1960s. Then they wonder why they are accused of being debunkers or extreme skep- tics. I would simply call them \"uninformed\" rather than us- ing the \"I-word.\" One finds the \"pelicanization of ufology\" (a reference to Kenneth Arnold allegedly having mistaken pelicans for something much less mundane) as a new term for this notion, which has been much discussed on UFO Up- dates. What these Young Turks (including some very bright, if apparently misguided people) fail to realize is that those of us who are serious, scien- tific investigators of UFO cases (not assuming every odd thing seen in the sky is a spaceship) obviously screened all those reports from the Classic Period of UFOlogy very carefully against possible prosaic ex- planations. At NICAP we routinely checked every re- port against earth satellites, meteors, advertising planes, balloons, weather phenomena, or any other possible ordinary stimulus that might have generated a false re- port. The NICAP files are full of evidence that we were meticulous investigators. When in 1999 or 2000 someone starts suggesting that maybe Socorro was a dust devil, or a hot-air bal- loon, I say that the person who suggests this needs to learn more about UFO history. The tendency among \"psychosocial\" theorists, who either debunk all UFO sightings as having natural or conventional origins or are constantly trying to do so, while not understanding UFO history, is to baldly assume that all cases must have a conventional explanation. Just in case we really are being visited, how would they ever discover this extraordinarily important fact. The Extraterrestrial Hypothesis (ETH) for UFOs is based firmly on thousands of well-witnessed and well- investigated cases that not only cannot be simply ex- plained, but also display recurring patterns of shape, luminosity, performance, and physical effects. If the latter were not true—no consistent phenomenological patterns—then the Data Denial Theory (DDT) might be more convincing. But \"Aye, there's the rub.\" Which data bases are the two schools of thought accepting as relevant and basing their theories on? Are carefully screened witness reports valid \"data,\" or not? I am assuming here that the alternative hypotheses (unrecognized natural phenomenon or secret earthly technology) have fewer followers and I will gladly debate anyone who believes them. As I have argued elsewhere, any \"unrecognized natural phenomenon\" that threatens humanity as UFOs do deserves scien- tific research funding at least comparable to that of natural disasters. And as for \"secret earthly technol- ogy,\" do your homework! For those unaware of the military/political history of UFO investigation in the United States, it is impor- tant to understand that at least twice, the elements of the U.S. Air Force most closely involved with investi- gating UFO reports concluded that UFOs probably were interplanetary spacecraft/To be sure, it was a reductio adabsurdum (for Latin fans) argument, based on the finding that no earthly technology ex- isted that could explain the reports. But given the na- ture of the reports and the inability of the elite investi- gatory personnel involved to find an explanation in terms of human technology, the ETH was (is) a logi- cal conclusion. A major difference in perspective derives from the fact that more recent generations have not been ex- posed to the same highly impressive, real-time data that we were describing apparent \"craft from else- where.\" The \"abduction phenomenon\" began taking over in the 1970s, with results that are far too com- plex to deal with in this column. (See The UFO Evi- dence, Volume II, Scarecrow Press, December 2000). Ironically, this same dichotomy (either UFOs are interplanetary or they don't exist) was clearly ex- pressed in Capt. Edward J. Ruppelt's Book The Re- port on Unidentified Flying Objects in discussing the attitudes of senior Air Force generals. And his com- mentary had to do with what evidence or testimony you accept as valid, and what you reject on skeptical grounds.

Impressed with crop circles In July of this year (2000) I had the opportunity to visit the United Kingdom for a couple weeks. The pri- mary purpose for my trip was to spend some time with my companion Hildi who lives in Glastonbury, En- gland. Since I knew the timing of my visit would al- low me to see and hopefully visit some \"crop circles\" I did a little exploration of web sites before I left. I was absolutely amazed at the patterns which 1 saw, and was wondering why these developments hadn't surfaced in the general press in the U.S. After my visit and discussions with various people in the UK, it is now clear to me that crop \"circles\" or pictograms have suffered the same fate that UFOs and other phenom- ena have which do not fit the current paradigm. Upon arriving in London on July 20, 1 was picked up by my companion and a friend, and on the way back to Glastonbury we stopped at the Barge Inn. The Barge Inn is located along one of the many canals crisscross- ing England, and is a meeting place and informal head- quarters for crop \"circle\" researchers and visitors. Pho- tos of the latest crop \"circles\" are tacked up on a bulle- tin board. Outside, looking toward nearby hills, a simple crop \"circle\" could be seen. After getting something to eat, we went up to the circle and entered it. The plants on the floor of the circle were woven into a basket like pattern. Unlike the few hoaxed or manmade \"circles,\" the stalks of the plants were not broken, but looked like they had suddenly decided to bend down and grow in a horizontal direction. My assessment after visiting several crop pic- tograms, is that the man-made \"circles\" are relatively few, which are composed of simple forms having very poor geometric precision compared to the amazing pictograms. There are other factors which clearly delineate a man- made circle from the absolutely amazing pictograms, which can be learned from the web sites and several books. I would recommend the book Crop Circles: The Greatest Mystery of Modern Times by Lucy Pringle, 1999, Harper Collins Publishers, ISBN 07225 3855 3, $27.00.1 had an opportunity to talk with Lucy at the Glastonbury Crop Circle Conference held July 28-30 during my visit. She personally flies out over the fields and takes photos. Since I have for many years used enhanced intuitive capabilities to pick up additional information, I did sit in the crop circle near the Barge Inn and picked up some interesting impressions pertaining to the future. In addi- tion, I put out the thought, somewhat as a test but really a request, that I would like to see a crop pictogram appear which could provide me some insight into the direction I should pursue in my advanced transport/field physics re- search activities. We then went on to Glastonbury, to London, and then back to Glastonbury. Eight days later, we went back out into crop circle country and again visited the Barge Inn. On the bulletin board, was an astounding new pictogram (see the web sites: http://cropcircleconnector.com/2000/aveburytrusloe/ aveburytruslo e2000a.html and http:// cropcircleconnector.com/2000/2000.html). The picto- gram was shaped like a bar magnet, with magnetic field lines coming out of the north and south poles. The pictogram had appeared on July 22 two days after my arrival in England (and my first visit to the Barge Inn) We determined its location, visited the pattern and spent a lot of time exploring it. The precision and intricacy of the pattern was stun- ning. -Alan Holt M.S. Physical Science (astrophysics), currently a project manager for NASA's International Space Station.

Marvelous to behold in bin- oculars or a telescope, the object glows from the impact of intense ultraviolet radiation emitted from a tiny star cluster in the center of the cloud. Four of these hot young stars are easily visible in a small telescope, forming a trap- ezoid-shaped pattern called the Trapezium.

The displays describe various UFO types, a description of the abduction ex- perience, information about extraterrestrial life, pro- pulsion and interstellar travel possibilities, and descrip- tive literature about MUFON. We are setting up a pro- cess for schools to use the MUFON Museum and In- formation Center for field trips. One Denver adult tour group has already scheduled a visit for March 2001. The fundamental purpose of the Museum and Infor- mation Center is public education and media services. We do need funds to maintain and expand the center. Since income tax time is approaching, we are urging members to send I.R.S. tax-deductible donations to MUFON, P.O. Box 369. Morrison, CO 80465-0369. The MUFON office will acknowledge all donations with a letter that you can attach to your income tax return. Bland Pugh is recovering Florida State Director Bland Pugh advises that he is now out of the hospital and on the road to full recov- ery. He is looking forward to being able to resume his MUFON duties in the not too distant future. We offer our prayers for his continued speedy recovery. Speaker's list MUFON receives a lot of requests for speakers for civic, fraternal, educational and media organizations. The MUFON Board of Directors noted that we don't have a centralized listing of people available to respond to all of these events. This causes us to miss opportu- nities to expand the MUFON membership rolls, edu- cate the public on the subject of UFOs, and receive some new UFO reports. Accordingly, the MUFON headquarters office has been requested to develop a MUFON Speaker's List to fill this need. MUFON State Directors, Consultants, and Research Specialists are requested to provide a listing of inter- ested qualified individuals for the MUFON Speaker's List. Please include name, address, telephone num- ber, email address and subject/specialty information to Headquarters for inclusion. Best Evidence Many MUFON members have requested summa- ries of the best UFO cases, the most credible witnesses, and good material to use in presentations and contact with the media. This information does exist in paper- back book form. It is called the UFO Briefing Docu- ment, written by Don Berliner, with Marie Galbraith and Antonio Huneeus. The book is the first volume of the Whitley Strieber's Hidden Agendas series pub- lished by Dell Publishing. The book was originally published by the UFO Research Coalition; a coopera- tive project of MUFON, CUFOS and FUFOR; for the education of public officials and heads of state. It is now available for a limited time at your local book- store. New MUFON Officers Georgia State Director Tom Sheets has named John Bodin as Assistant State Director for southern Geor- gia.

In lieu of mailing cards to everyone, we have elected to pass our greetings for a Joyful Hanukkah, a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year in this manner in the Journal. Seguin office is closed Please note that the MUFON office in Seguin, TX. is now closed. All MUFON correspondence must now be sent to MUFON, Post Office Box 369. Morrison, CO 80465-0369. The new headquarters office is located at the cor- ner of Kipling Parkway and Chatfield Avenue in the Marketplace at Ken.Caryl. The address is 10143 West Chatfield Ave. Littleton. CO 80127. Telephone: (303) 932-7709. MUFON transition report The move of the MUFON Headquarters office from Seguin, TX, to Littleton. CO, was finished in October. At the end of October, Walt Andrus loaded his pick- up with the remaining MUFON office files and equip- ment and drove to Colorado, arriving in time for the Oct. 29 grand opening on the new headquarters. The Colorado MUFON group participated in the grand opening event and helped make it a rousing suc- cess. To our surprise, Denver's Channel 9 TV News team showed up at the event and gave us some nice coverage on the five o'clock news segment that day. Since then we have enjoyed favorable press from ABC News, FOX News, the Denver Post newspaper, and neighborhood newspapers. The CBS Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn picked up on the ABC news segment and poked a bit of fun at us on nationwide late night television. The publicity has resulted in a renewed flow of new applications for membership. When an operation is dropped in one city and picked up in another, things are bound to go wrong. The MUFON transition is no exception. After the move, the computer refused to let us in to any of the files, so we sent it to the shop for repair. Fortunately, Tom Deuley brought along a backup zip disk containing all of the files, and we were able to reload everything af- ter the repair was finished. In the meantime, Walt con- tinued to maintain the membership and financial files until the office closed in Seguin at the end of October. Since then we have had a few glitches in the pro- cesses and a few problems interpreting the informa- tion listed on the membership card files vs. the elec- tronic files. This will all smooth out as we become more familiar with the operation. We are concerned about all of the manual opera- tions required to maintain the day-to-day business, so we are seeking ways to automate more of the func- tions. As our members are already aware, we have significantly improved the MUFON web site, thanks to Wendy Ban. Don Weatherby, Bill Konkolesky, Dan Wright and Tom Deuley. Since then we have started the process of streamlining some of the office proce- dures. At Tom Deuley's suggestion, we implemented the use of Avery business card stock and the electronic production of the MUFON identification cards. This eliminates reprinting the existing cards and the pro- cess of manually typing in the name, position and date. All of this information now comes from the computer database. We apologize to anyone missing an issue of the MUFON UFO Journal due to the transition in printing and mailing from Seguin to Versailles, MO. About a dozen members missed their October issue, so we mailed replacement copies from Colorado. In addition, we have noticed that some members are neglecting to send their new addresses to MUFON headquarters when they move. When this happens the post office.refuses to forward the Journal and charges a handling fee for sending it back to us. To prevent missing issues of the Journal, members are urged to send us their new address as soon as they know they are moving. Funds needed for MUFON UFO Museum Walt Andrus founded a MUFON UFO Information Center and Museum in Seguin back in 1994. During the MUFON transition to Colorado, the Center was closed and relocated to the front half of the new Colo- rado Headquarters office. It is once again open daily, and has been a real hit with the newspaper and televi- sion news people. In addition, we have been visited by groups of chil- (Continued on Page 23)"}]
