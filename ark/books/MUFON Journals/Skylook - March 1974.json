Box 9 O'Fallon, Mo 63366 One of the difficult problems faced by serious UFO researchers is the lack of credibility often associated with UFO reports, and in some cases with UFO investigations in general. This problem is caused by many things, some of which are simply beyond control. There is the sensational type of newspaper and magazine, which often is more interested in run- ning interesting stories than in the truth. There are UFO hoaxes, which not only add to credibility problems, but often create serious hazards. There is the self-proclaimed UFO investigator without sufficient training or adequate back-up organization. There is the so-called \"kook fringe.\" There are others. Skylook is attempting to do its part to sepa- rate the serious research from the merely inter- esting by clearly labeling articles and providing full facts on each article used. Obviously, MUFON investigative reports should be viewed as being more reliable than newspaper stories, and should be labeled as such. This we attempt to do. In addition, Skylook often holds articles and photos until investigations are completed. At this time, for example, we are holding a fas- cinating UFO photo which is being evaluated for authenticity. We are also holding an equally fascinating account of a UFO repair operation, pending an interview with a second witness and a search for a repair part which may have been left behind. We may occasionally make slips in carrying out this policy, since we are human. But the deter- mination is there, and we hope our readers share it. We welcome your suggestions for increasing our credibility. Free copy of Skylook Do you know someone who should be sub- scribing to Skylook, but isn't?

Christian. On or about Oct. 15 or 16, 1973, Robert Eicholz. 58, who owns and operates an auto- motive repair company in St. Louis, was fish- ing in a pond on a farm near Red Bud, 111., owned by his cousin. Red Bud is about 35 miles southeast of St. Louis, The weather was clear, bright, sunny, and warm. At about 2:30 p.m. Mr. Eicholz says he heard what sounded like an airplane in trouble, cut- ting its engines, then speeding up again. He stepped out from under some trees to get a better look, and saw a four-engine prop plane taking evasive action to avoid hitting what appeared to be a large horseshoe-shaped object that was hovering in the sky at an altitude of about 3,500 to 5,000 feet. The plane, which cane within 500 feet of the object, seemed to be making a turn from an eastward course to a southward course (Scott AFB is near Belleville, 111.). The plane flew south, and the object left in an easterily direction at a high rate of speed. Mr. Eicholz said that the ends of the horse- shoe, which were down, looked like bubbles. He said that, in the distance, the object looked like a balloon spider dragging two balloon webs. The color of the object was described as like a plastic cleaners bag with a dark, distinct out- line around the object. No noise was heard from the object. The duration of this sighting was a few minutes or less. Mr. Eicholz resumed fishing', thinking he might have observed some sort of launch experi- ment. He was fishing from the bank, using two poles with plastic bobbers, one 1\" in diameter, and the other one IV in diameter, with pieces of metal running through the centers of them. After sitting under the trees fishing for about one-half hour, he said the bobbers began to pop out of the water, sometimes as much as a foot high, then settle back into the water again. Thinking at first that a school of fish might be playing with his bait, he sat watching this happen for about 15 minutes. Realizing that fish were not causing the bobbers to pop out of the water, he looked up into the sky, between tree branches, and observed that the object from the first sighting had returned, and was hover- ing over the pond at an altitude of about 900- 1,000 feet. The object was slowly turning % circles; that is, about 90 degrees to the left, then back to the original position. Every time the object would pass over the bobbers, the bobbers would pop out of the water, according to Eicholz. After watching the object for another 10-15 minutes, he decided to try to get some more witnesses. His cousin was about 350 yards away near another pond planting strawberries, and the £4-30 PORTHOLES The above drawing has been copied from one sketched by the witness, Mr. Robert Eicholz of St. Louis. farm house was about -3/4 mile away. Deciding to go for his cousin, Mr. Eicholz stepped from under the trees, at which time the object began to take off. After he had walked about 50 feet, the object had vanished into- the northwest. As the object took off, it wobbled from side to side on its vertical axis, the faster the wobble the greater the burst of speed. Mr. Eicholz said the wobble was similar to the turning while hovering. He said the object appeared to be about 12 feet wide. The ends of the horseshoe were, as previously noted, shaped like bubbles or rounded cabins, perhaps 6 feet in diameter. Each bubble appeared to have a porthole in its center, per- haps 2-2% feet in diameter. The color was like clear plastic, or some type of material that re- flected light from the sky, sharply outlined at the edges with a darker color. The top of the \"perfect arch\" appeared to have been joined to- gether, like a rope which had been spliced. The part connecting the bubbles and forming the arch appeared to the observer to be some sort of tube. No noise was heard during either sighting. Mr. Eicholz was unable to locate anyone else who had seen the object, although several night sightings occurred on Oct. 16 at the SIU campus in Edwardaville. A test with a magnet indicated that the bobbers were attracted to. the magnet. The investigator notes that he has known Mr. Eicholz about 20 to 25 years."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Around the Network Ann Druffel and Dan Haefele appeared as two MUFON investigators to talk before two combined youth groups at the United Presbyterian Church in Los Angeles.

Kirkpatrick"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Center for UFO Studies explained Considerable interest has been shown in the newly-formed Center for UFO Studies, which is designed to serve as a central clearinghouse for UFO investigations. Set up under the guidance of Dr. J. Allen Hynek of Northwestern'University it received the early endorsement of MUFON. The financial aspect of the Center is cur- rently being handled by the Public Education Group (PEG), a UFO study group affiliated with MUFON and headed by MUFON Illinois State Section Director Sherman J. Larsen. PEG was in existence and had tax-exempt status prior to the formation of the Center, and volunteered to serve as recip- ient and disburser of funds for the Center until other arrangements can be made. A detailed description of the Center has been submitted to Skylook by Larsen, as follows: Introduction . . The unexplained content of many UFO reports from credible witnesses in many parts of the world defines a problem and presents a signifi- cant mystery. Any phenomenon which has occupied the thought of so many people for so many years is surely a subject worthy of serious scientific study. The UFO phenomenon has not been given serious attention in the past,'yet it is an incontrover- tible fact that a great many unsolved UFO reports exist. The phenomenon, on the contrary, has been the subject of misconceptions, misinformation, and an unscientific approach. The UFO CENTER has been established for those who wish to see positive scientific action taken to end a quarter century of misrepresentation and buffoonery. The evidence is strong that the UFO phenomenon represents new empirical observations of great potential value to mankind. The work of the CENTER is directed toward the discovery of the essential nature of the UFO phenomenon. A definition of a UFO The CENTER defines a UFO as \"the reported per- ception of an object or light seen in the sky or upon the land, the appearance, trajectory and general dynamic and luminescent behavior of which do not suggest a logical, conventional explana- tion, and which is not only mystifying to the or- iginal percipient but remains unidentified after close scrutiny of all available evidence by per- sons who are technically capable of making a com- mon sense Identification, if one is possible.\" J. Allen Hynek, The UFO Experience Origin of the CENTER There exists a growing number.of scientists,, engineers and other professionals, generally as- sociated with universities, laboratories and in- Dr. J. Allen Hynek dustry, who have contemplated the possible sig- nificance of the UFO phenomenon. They noted that such significance to science and society was be- ing totally obscured by the popular confusion and gross misconceptions regarding the UFO phenome- non. The UFO CENTER provides an avenue whereby the interests and talents of these scientists and other professionals can be focused and brought to bear on this challenging problem. A significant number of them have become actively associated with the CENTER and have volunteered their tal- ents and facilities. Objectives of the UFO CENTER The CENTER has four principal objectives: (1) to pursue a rigorous study and analysis of the UFO phenomenon, calling upon the talents and services of CENTER Associates and employing the existing facilities (computers, physical and bio- logical laboratories, etc.) at universities and in industry wherever possible. While the ulti- mate objective is the solution of the UFO enigma or, should this not lie within our present scien- tific rubric, then at least to organize and,doc- ument as thoroughly as possible for the future this phenomenon which has figured so prominently In the present epoch. (2) to operate a UFO CENTRAL, a clearing house to which persons can report UFO experiences with-"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"out fear of ridicule or unwanted publicity, and with the knowledge that such reports will be giv- en serious attention. (3) to provide Bulletins and Technical Reports and be a source of reliable information about the UFO phenomenon to schools and universities, sci- entific organizations, and to the public in gen- eral. (A) to assist and help guide correlative stud- ies conducted in this and other countries through international symposia and conferences. It is not generally known, for instance, that active work in this field is being pursued on several continents. The interdisciplinary nature of the UFO prob- lem is clearly apparent. There are aspects of the problem which are of interest to psycholo- gists, sociologists, . medical practioners and others. Indeed, there has rarely been a subject so interdisciplinary in character. Implementation of the Objectives To accomplish these objectives, the CENTER as- sumes the following functions and has at present, or is developing, the following facilities: A. Central Data Bank The CENTER has access to modern electronic computers so 'that a central data bank for UFO data can be maintained, queried, and constantly updated. Information theory and modern methods of information retrieval, pattern recognition, etc., are used to establish patterns and cor- relations between various UFO parameters (time, place, demographic factors, witness reliability, types of sightings, etc.). B. Immediate Investigative Facilities It is essential that current UFO sightings be reported as accurately, fully and as expeditious- ly as possible. A toll-free, nation-wide tele- phone number has been made available to law en- forcement offices across the country, and to other responsible organizations on a 24-hour basis. This UFO CENTRAL facility is integral to the operation of the CENTER. It enables the CENTER to be quickly apprised of UFO events, to make preliminary evaluations, and to dispatch local investigators to the scene. It has been well established that a UFO sight- ing represents a very real event, and often a very frightening experience, to the persons in- volved. The existence of UFO CENTRAL and its close association with police departments, civil defense, and various aviation agencies provides a ridicule-free avenue for the natural desire on the part of the witneses to communicate their ex- perience to someone in authority. C. Laboratory and Theoretical Research The CENTER'S main efforts are to be directed toward specific problems arising from the report- ed UFO cases. Thus, for instance, the large number of cases in which the UFO has been repor- ted to have interacted with the environment pre- sents a scientific toehold not available in the equally spectacular cases in which, however, no- thing has been left for study except the detailed reports of the witnesses. The research work is concerned in part with laboratory analyses of plants, trees and soil that have been affected by the presence of the UFO; medical study of witnesses who have been re- ported as temporarily blinded, paralyzed and sub- ject to nausea, headaches, etc.; witness credi- bility; statistical studies and theoretical in- vestigations into the dynamic behavior of UFOs. The problems studied are, thus, not the UFO itself, but the intriguing problems and experi- ments suggested by the consenus of UFO reports. A visitor to laboratories associated with the CENTER might find it hard to discover that the problems being studied and the experiments being performed had any direct connections with UFOs. In brief, the research would concern itself with, for example, 1. Laboratory analysis of residues associ- ated with a UFO Close Encounter. 2. Medical examinations of persons and ani- mals affected. 3. Theoretical studies of the dynamic and luminescent properties of UFOs. 4. Credibility of witnesses. 5. Photographic and spectrographic analysis. Public Participation in' the Work of the CENTER Persons or organizations interested in fur- thering serious scientific work on the UFO prob- lem can participate best by volunteering their technical facilities, or by making tax-deducti- ble contributions to the Center for UFO Studies, P.O. Box 11, Northfield, Illinois 60093 OBJECT HALF SIZE.OF FOOTBALL FIELD REPORTEDLY HOVERS NEAR OREGON AUTO LEBANNON, OREGON, EXPRESS, DEC. 13, 1973— Wayne Girard of Lebannon was driving with his wife Edith on Interstate 5 near Wilsonville when a \"large ship about half the length of a football field\" appeared and hovered in front of their car. \"It couldn't have been mistaken for anything else,\" said Girard. He said he told his wife at the time that \"it looks like we've seen our first flying saucer.\" The \"ship\" was surrounded by lights located in circular ports about 2 to 3 feet deep, according to Girard, and there was one area the shape of an inverted C that had no lights. There was a blue light located in the center on top of the ship. The \"ship\" was in sight for 10 to 15 minutes before disappearing behind a hill. Girard did not report the sighting to police, and was re- portedly hesitant about telling the paper about the experience."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"UFO s Behind the Iron Curtain BY JOE BRILL Although this particular sighting is over twenty-five years old, I never the less believe it to be one of the best daylight disc sightings on record. The date of the sighting was June 10, 19A7. The time was approximately 3:30 p.m. The loca- tion was Budapest, Hungary. The newspapers of Hungary did report this incident in a very minor way and it is now impossible to secure any cop- ies of the articles that told of what was seen. However, one of the eye-witnesses to this event has written to me about what was observed, and this is his own personal account of what took place on that June 10, 1947, day over Buda- pest. The witness's name is Mr. Gyorik-. Ferenc. \"I was standing on the corner of Arena Street on the right hand corner facing toward Zuglo, at the place of today's People's Sport Arena. The flying objects first appeared to my right, where the left hand side of the Sport's Arena is today and the time was approximately 3:30 p.m. \"They were shaped like discs and there were four of them. Their color was a yellow-reddish. The distance between each of them was about fifty meters. The entire observation lasted for thirty seconds and was seen by many people be- sides myself. \"Their elevation in relation to the horizon was about fifty to sixty degrees above the hori- zon. Their formation was in one straight line, one behind the other. They made a small arc of about 120° in their movement around the corner of the park. The discs were shaped like a plate or a fiat sort of lentil. They appeared to be \"swimming\" through the sky and after making the curvature, they disappeared in a northwesterly direction toward Varosliget Park. \"In measuring the discs with my thumb at arm's length, they were each one thickness of the thumb (sideways) in width and two to three thicknesses of the thumb (straight up) in length They were eight to ten thicknesses (straight up) of my thumb apart from one another and they maintained that distance during the entire ob- servation. The weather was perfectly clear and there was not a cloud in the sky at the time.\" According to the United States Air Force Aerospace Intelligence files, there were some fifty reports submitted stating that the witnes- ses had seen strange \"silver colored balls fly- ing at fantastic speeds, during the daylight hours\" on that same June 10, 1947, day. These reports were never investigated as they did not occur in the United States, but were included in the Air Fprce Files as having been reported. To my knowledge not a word concerning these sightings was published in any U. S. newspaper, as Kenneth Arnold's sighting did not occur until June 24th of that same year. Something was observed by at least fifty wit- nesses and it was reported, although very poor- ly, in the press of Hungary. That something was four or more strange disc shaped objects that today remain as Unidentified. Cloud-like object classified as UFO (Photo on cover) In late\"January, French national television for the first time showed the public, pictures of a UFO taken by scientists aboard a Jet flying over Africa last June. While the object appears at first glance to be nothing more than a cloud, Serge.Koutchmy, an astrophysicist at the National Scientific Re- search Center, and Claude Poher, an official of the National Center of Space Studies, have classified it as an Unidentified Flying Object, according to a UPI news release. \"Study of the enlarged prints indicates the object was at an altitude higher than the 56,000 feet of the Concorde,\" said Koutchmy. Because of the altitude involved, most ob- servers would automatically rule out an ordinary cloud as a possible explanation. The object was estimated to have a diameter of at least 660 feet, according .to Koutchmy. The object showed up on frames of color photos taken by the scientists aboard a Concorde supersonic jet which was flying in the path of the June 30 eclipse of the sun. The object was not noticed until the film was developed. By flying in the Concorde, the French, British, and American scientists on board had the opportunity of observing and photographing the eclipse for 85 minutes. The pilot of the Concorde, Andre Turcat, com- mented that for him the photo \"is an interesting and curious document, but I'll not hazard to say what it was. After having observed it, you aak yourself what it is—why not. a phenomenon of ionization or the disintegration of a meteorite, for expmple?\" Poher contends that \"we must rid this subject of passion, get used to the evidence, and pre- pare ourselves for more frequent confronta- tions.\" (Reported by Joe Brill) 8"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"In Others' Words BY LUCIUS FARISH NATIONAL ENQUIRER seems to be featuring more UFO material in their recent issues.- The Feb. 3 issue told of sightings in Kentucky, as well as carrying an article on Josef Blumrich's \"Ezek- iel's Wheel' 1 spaceship theories.

The Feb. 17 issue of NATIONAL TATTLER featured an 8-page \"pull-out\" section on UFOs. The Jan., 17 issue of ROLLING STONE contained a very long article on the Pascagoula, Miss. case. In many ways, it was the most informative article to see print thus far, but the author's \"style\" and obvious biases would undoubtedly \"turn off\" many readers. The Feb. issues of MECHANIX ILLUSTRATED and CRAWDADDY contained roundup articles on the re- cent flap, as do the March issues of MALE and MAN'S. These are largely re-hash. Feb. ARGOSY has a \"Bermuda Triangle\" article by Robert Marx in which he attempts to explain all the happenings in that area by conventional means. Methinks he does not quite succeed. Jacques Vallee has an article on the supposed psychic aspects of Ufology in the Jan./Feb. issue of PSYCHIC. An article in the March issue of FATE gave de- tails of a 1971 sighting near Miamisbiirg, Ohio. Two articles of interest are to be found in the March issue of SAGA. Warren Smith reports on the Pascagoula case (again!), and Joseph Good- avage provides some highly speculative material on lunar mysteries. The spring issue of PROBE THE UNKNOWN is a \"UFO special,\" with most of the articles being devoted to the subject. There are interviews with von Daniken and Dr. Hynek, as well as other material of great interest, including \"The Distortion Factor\" by Steve Erdmann, which fea- tures the UFO Study Group of Greater St. Louis. There is also an article about Stanton Friedman. The first quarterly issue of SAGA's UFO RE- PORT (dated March) will be out shortly. Dale M. Titler and I will have an article on people who claim to have touched UFOs in this first issue of the. REPORT. Is there anyone among the SKYLOOK readers who has not heard of that arcane and supposedly unat- tainable volume, the Varo edition of M. K. Jes- sup's THE CASE FOR THE UFO? If you have been reading UFO literature for any length of time, you will surely be familiar with the controversy which has surrounded this document. Well, if, like me, you have always wanted a copy to see what all the fuss was about, your problems are over—if you have $25.00 to spare, that is! Gray Barker has recently re-printed the Varo edition, and his own limited edition is now available at the above-mentioned price. The annotators of Jessup's original book implied that they posses- sed intimate knowledge of UFOs, their origins, motives, etc. Whether or not all this is true, the book does make for fascinating reading. The original Jessup book was truly a classic and should be read by anyone with the slightest in- terest in UFOs. The additional material—true or false—adds even more for the reader to consider. Copies may be obtained from Saucerian Press, Inc. Box 2223 - Clarksburg, WV 26301. The names of Janet and Colin Bord will be quite familiar to Ufologists who receive various Bri- tish UFO publications, such as FSR and BUFORA JOURNAL. How the Bords have put together a large and beautiful book entitled MYSTERIOUS BRITAIN, which chronicles the many mysteries (including UFOs) to be found in their homeland. One chapter is devoted entirely to UFOs which have been seen over various parts of Britain, and portions of other chapters mention possible UFO links with leys and the strange hill figures of large size which are only visible in their entirety from the air. The book is filled with photographs (many taken by the Bords) and other interesting illus- trations. I think you will find it most absorbj- ing.

Central area of city known as Boyle Heights and in an area bounded by Whittier Blvd.,Lorena St., Olym- pic Blvd., and Indiana St. WEATHER: Clear and cool. Temperature was in the high 50 ? s with no appreciable wind. Almost full moon at approximately 45 deg in the south- eastern sky. Stars were clearly visible. WITNESSES: Primarily two police officers of the Los Angeles police Dept., C. C. Smith (29) and Joseph Wynkoop (28) with four and five years service respectively. Officer Smith was inter- viewed for approximately 45 minutes (tape record- ed) and is skeptical of UFOs. He readily admits that he (they) saw one, but that he does not know where they originate or what they are. Smith called it a UFO because no one could identify the object. Other persons in the\" area reported seeing a UFO prior to and during the subject sightings; these included two additional policemen from the same station as Smith and Wynkoop. The private citizens who called in UFO reports did not wish to be identified: SIGHTING: In response to phone calls 'from the Boyle Heights area of East Los,Angeles reporting possible UFOs, police officers Smith and Wynkoop from the Hollenbeck Station were dispatched at approximately 9:45 p.m. PST to investigate. After searching the area from which the reports came without seeing anything unusual, they made one last swing eastward on Whittier Blvd. from Soto St. Soon after passing the intersection of Euclid and Whittier, Smith first saw an object on the north side of Whittier and east of Lorena St. Officer Wynkoop verified what Smith had seen al- most instantly. At this point, the UFO was de&- cending at a 45 degree angle and heading south- west. As they passed under the Pomona Freeway underpass, several blocks west of Lorena, they lost sight of the UFO f for several seconds. As they approached the intersection of Lorena and Whittier the object reappeared from behind residential homes and small business buildings in the area; the object was in an ascending flight path of approximately 45 degrees. At one point while they were traveling east on Whittier, Smith said that the UFO passed . behind a supermarket sign and was large enough to overlap the sign. The object was moving relatively slowly at this time. This sign, located at Jonson's Market at the northeast corner of Lorena and Whittier, is ap- proximately 40 feet off the ground. (Editor's Note: A newspaper report that the object passed in front of the sign is in error.) The pair turned right on Lorena with the in- tention of paralleling the object for a possible photograph. There was a relatively slow ascent, then the UFO paused momentarily before ascending at a great rate of speed...(Smith) \"It was almost like the object being in one position at one mo- ment and then being in another at another moment ...in the blink of an eye.\" The UFO rose to an estimated altitude of 1000 to 1500 feet. While near Whittier Blvd. The UFO must have been very close to the ground to be ob- scured by the local buildings. At the top of the rapid ascent, the UFO paused again and took off again in a horizontal south- west direction at a great rate of speed. The two officers followed the • UFO as fast as they could under the prevailing conditions down Lorena St. and had to stop their cruiser where Lorena dead- ended into Grand Vista. At this location, Officer Smith took a photo of the'UFO with a Kodak Insta- matic camera through the windshield of the police vehicle. During the event, Officer Smith and Wynkoop were in contact with the watch commander at Hol- lenbeck Station by radio•telephone. Other sight- ings, were reported to the watch commander from the same area and during the same time frame. At least one of the callers said that the UFO touch- ed down; however, it may have only appeared that way. Based on the officer's sighting, it does appear that the UFO only closely approached the ground. -  . j OBJECT: The object ' was described as an oval or oblong shaped. Based on a sketch provided by Smith, it was an ellipse, and most likely, the device would have been disc shaped from directly underneath. The color was described as a very bright white light with a slight tinge of blue— like a mercury vapor lamp. Smith said it was so bright that one could not look at it for.very long. A definite shape could be'discerned. The brightness was noted to be greater than that of the moon. No other details could be determined; i.e., no porthole, no antennae,- or other lights. The object displayed a brilliance without rad- iance or sparkle; There was no movement from within. No noise was heard; however, they were in a closed car. The object did not rotate. They noted no abnormal electrical effects on the car; no problems with the radio, ignition or lights. ESTIMATION OF SIZE: According to an article in the Los Angeles Times, Officer Wynkoop esti- mated the apparent diameter of the UFO as that of a half dollar at arms length when, they were about six blocks away. It was assumed that this ratio applied when they were near the corner of Euclid and Whittier. From Euclid the .estimated flight path of the UFO scales out to approximately 3000 feet. Calculating the diameter of the device using the above numbers, we get a dimension of 125 feet, which appears large compared to other reported UFO dimensional data. The apparent di- ameter ratio used was 1.25\" for the coin held at 10"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"30 inches. Officer Smith reported that when the UFO passed behind the large lighted sign at Jonson's Super- market, it overlapped that of the sign; i.e., its major dimension . exceeded that of the sign by 10 to 20 per cent. Using the known horizontal length of Jonson's sign (20 feet), and the best guess where the UFO crossed Whittier and the: per cent overlap 7 of the UFO'to the sign (20 per cent), one can estimate the same horizontal 'dimension .of the UFO by a \\different method. This time the size came out to - approximately .33 feet, smaller than the first method .by a good bit. It is emphasized that both\" methods are crude ^estimations at the very most. It would appear 'that-. pfficer-\"Wynkoop over estimated the apparent diameter, as the lat- ter method appears to be a better estimate of the true size.of the UFO. During the course of; the chase, Officer Smith related that telephone calls were being received at Hpllenbeck from the Indiana St. area and that the.UFO was reported to be west of Indiana St. This fact substantiates Smith's estimation of the flight path. Thus, from all of,this, the UFO ap- peared to be more on the order of 33 feet in di- ameter. PHOTOGRAPH: After the subject sighting, the photograph was taken immediately to the Scientif- ic Investigative Dept. (SID) of LAPD where it was processed and printed. Three officials from SID evaluated the photo and could not identify the one\"light source in the upper left center of the shot which was reported by Smith to be the UFO. No one connected with LAPD could give an opinion, even off the record, of what the light source was or could be. Subsequent to the evaluation of the photo, £ team from SID accompanied the officers back to the location where the UFO photo was taken. This was some two hours after the incident and a fog bank had settled into the area. SID personnel at the site re-evaluated the photo again to deter- mine if. there could have been any extraneous light sources or conditions to explain the un- known light. The photograph as reviewed by Mr. Adrian Vance and the author showed a blurred whitish object a- bout 3/8\" in size on a 5\" by 7\" reproduction. No usable .details were evident to the reviewers: however, to a more accomplished expert there may be something of value. It is understood that the negative is in the hands of Dr. Nathan at JPL; Dr. Nathan is a member of MUFON. CONCLUSION: The witness, Officer C. C. Smith, by virtue of his job, is trained to be observant and unbiased and thus is a highly credible obser- ver. The UFO sighting as reported by the two of- ficers was substantiated by other unknown persons including two other policemen in the general area. The photo, although -somewhat lacking in details of shape and size, etc. does show an un- explained light source. This reported sighting appears to be a true unknown. Nebraska course on UFO's By Elmer Krai MUFON State Director, Nebraska In January, the first Nebraska college course on UFO's was taught at' Doane College in Crete, Neb. >y Associate Professor of Physics Everett W. Gross. An assistant was Associate Professor of Organic Chemistry Dr. David H. Smith. The course was advertised in the college cata- log as \"A Current Controversy: UFO's\" for the four-week Interterm. The course had an enroll- ment of 11 students. \"The whole idea of the course,\" according to Professor Gross, \"was to involve the students as deeply as possible in a current controversy. They were expected to bring their own views and to be exposed to pro and con views of scientists in the form of guest speakers and UFO literature.\" The content of the course centered around stellar evolution, the investigation of reports, meteorological phenomena, the occurrence of ball lightning, the basis of skepticism for the extra- terrestrial hypothesis, the problem of psycholog- ical phenomena, and problems in photographic evi- dence. In addition, students reported on books and other materials that presented information on UFO cases and a history of the subj.ect. Professor Gross said he selected J. Allen Hynek's The UFO Experience (Chicago: Henry Reg- nery Company, 1972) as the basic textbook \"be- cause Hynek has the correct attitude, namely, there is evidence of a need for scientific study.\" Members of the Mutual UFO Network supplied many materials, including copies of the MUFON Symposium Proceedings (1971-73) and slides from Walter Andrus, director. Various tape recordings were provided by Elmer Krai. Additionally, students pooled materials they owned. Guest speakers were James P. Allison of Doane College, Dr. William Welch of Hastings College, George R. Wilken of the National Weather Service office in Omaha, Elmer Krai of Grand Island High School, and two professors from the Department of Physics at the University of Nebraska. All of the students stated in a course evalu- ation that they were happy they had registered for the course. Some recommended additional speakers, especially in the field of plasmas and actual sighting of a UFO. According to Professor Gross, \"A predominance of the students neileved in the ITH at the end of the course. But most had not significantly changed their opinions dur- ing the course.\" Expiration date Please check the subscription expiration date on your address label to see if this is your last month for your current subscription.

Keyhoe's latest book, \"Aliens From Space,\" says he agrees with Keyhoe's con- tention that the \"aliens\" probably do not have a hostile intent. The columnist also believes that \"Operation Lure,\" which was developed by Keyhoe and others, should be tried. For those who have not yet read \"Aliens From Space,\" the following descrip- tion of \"operation Lure\" is excerpted from Key- hoe's book: \"The lure will have three or more dummy UFOs, disc-types with domes, built of aluminum. Each one will have glass panels to show that no one is hiding inside. The base will be unmanned, and the nearest humans will be stationed at hidden observation posts over a mile distant. \"Near the dummy UFOs will be several 'edu- cational buildings' containing a number of ex- hibits intended to interest UFO crews. To emphasize that no humans are concealed, the roofs will be made of shatterproof glass, so interiors can be seen from the air. Each build-; ing will have one glass wall to permit inspect tion on the ground. \"All the observer posts are to be below ground level, except for the camouflaged roofs, below which will be high-powered movie cameras j with telephoto lenses and concealed telescopes.\". Drummond notes that there is the question of whether Earthlings can communicate with the \"aliens\" after making contact. Concludes Drummond: \"...if humans are not up to communicating with extraterrestrial beings, it is quite likely that the extraterrestrials, whose scientific achievements would be so much greater than ours, can communicate with us.

UNUSUAL AERIAL OBJECT The object .was seen % mile south of Gravois Mills, Missouri, exact loaation: NE*s, SE^, Sec. 20, T.41N., R.17W., Morgan County. The obser- vation was made by five adults from 0130 to 0136 on Jan. 29, 1969. The object was seen by the five witnesses as a reddish-pink light source with a very faint beam of light extending northward from the front; and a brighter beam of light trailing the object to the south. Through 6x50 binoculars it ap- peared to be circular, with the beams extending north and south. There seemed to be a second ball, much fainter than the larger just in front of the brighter ball. The brighter beam was al- most pink and was slightly fan-shaped at the south end. The object was measured with a card ruler held at arms length: it was 1 inch' long and 1/8 inch in width at the widest point. The object was 35° above the horizon and was due north by compass reading. A camera was placed atop an automobile and two time exposures were taken. Scattered clouds moved into the area and the object was no longer visible. The brightest section appeared to be about as a 2nd magnitude star. The object did not change color or brightness during the 6 minute observa- tion. It was stationary during most of this time period. The temperature was 18°, wind from the E-SE at 12 mph. The camera used was a Yashica D, a twin-lens reflex, f/80mm, 3.5. The photographs were taken at f/3.5, exposure time, 15 seconds and 20 seconds. Film used was Tri-X ASA 400, 120.

(about 30 miles northwest of Pitts- burgh). He said the object was traveling from the northwest to the southeast _when . first ob- served,-and he. tried to* put • his spotlightvon it. He said' the object moved from : side to : side, dodg- ing his light. The object- hovered above high tension lines near the highway about' 1500 feet from the ground for about 15'minutes, he report- ed. Zlatovich .described the object as pie-shaped with red and white lights revolving in a clock- wise direction. He estimated the size to be that of a pie plate, from his location. He said the lights were much brighter than a star, and that they stayed at the same intensity at all times. There was no visible exhaust, no sound, and no interference with the patrol car's operation, lights, or radio, according to the officer. The next incident reportedly occurred about an hour later (7:30 p.m.) seven miles to the east of the first reported sighting. Three girls re- ported that they observed an object hovering in the vicinity of the atomic power plant at Ship- pinport, Pa., as they were returning home to In- dustry, Pa., in an auto. They described the ob-- ject as having red, white, and green lights, but they were unable to see beyond the lights. They said the object also had a very bright beam of light extending from the bottom, and that the lights stayed the same intensity at all times. The three girls—Debbie Hawthorne, Pauletta Croyle, and Bonnie Lofhus—said the object hovered for about five minutes, and apparently made no sound. There reportedly was television interference, and noticable animal disturbances (dogs'\"carried on and barked\"). The girls stop- ped at a friend's house and reported the incident to police. The third incident reportedly occurred an hour later (8:30 p.m.) in the Midland Heights area, very close to where officer Zlatovich had report- edly seen an object earlier. A Mr. Varvette and several youngsters said they saw the object, then Jumped into a car to follow it. The object, which had been moving to the east, was described as be- ing about 40 feet in diameter, with red, white, and green lights on the bottom. As the auto with Mr. Varvette and the youngsters came over a rise in the road, the object reportedly gained alti- tude in a straight direction. It was about 3,300 feet from their location when this occurred. The witnesses said they were near a pasture, and could hear that - the cattle were very disturbed. At the time of the sighting, the Midland police The above drawing has been sketched from one provided by Investigator Robert Royde of the pos- sible landing site of a UFO on or about IIov. 1, 1973, in Beaver County, Pa. were reportedly looking for M a strange \"animal,\" and did not see the object, which had passed over a housing project. . . . The final incident occurred the next day when Mr. Varvette and a friend were hunting wild game. They reportedly noticed an unusual \"perfect cir- cle ' near the edge of a pasture where a wooded area began. Near the circle were holes on the sloping side of the ground, according to Mr. Var- vette. To the rear of the housing project, foot- prints resembling those of the \"Big Foot\" crea- ture were reportedly found. A woman in the pro- ject, who was not identified in the report, claimed that she saw two large, round, greenish eyes staring from the woods as her flashlight hit them. 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"1974 Symposium June 22 in Akron Each year the MUTUAL UFO NETWORK (MUFON) spon- sors an annual symposium devoted to the study and sharing of information on the phenomenon known as unidentified flying objects.

ON TEXAS HIGHWAY DALLAS, TEXAS, TIMES HERALD, NOV. 20, 1973— Mrs. Faye Seeley and Mrs. Faye Hilemari and their children were returning to their homes in Rosebud from Buffalo at about 8:15 p. m. on November 18 when they saw a triangular shaped object. They at first thought it was a star, but the object brightened and dimmed, then began to pace their car. \"It came down to about two car lengths off the ground and just sat there like it was daring us to come closer,\" said Mrs. Seeley. She said she turned the car around and took off in the opposite direction. \"It rose back into the air a little distance and began to follow,\" said Mrs. Hileman. \"It came quickly for awhile as if try- ing to catch up. But when we saw the lights of a car up ahead.lt just slowed and followed. When we caught up with the other car the light from the object dimmed and it went straight up in the air and out of sight.\" OKLAHOMA DAIRY FARMER REPORTS \" ABJECT LANDED IN HIS PASTURE . ASSOCIATED PRESS, FEB. 18, 1974—Clay Knight, a dairy faj^ner .who lives near Vinita, Okla., has reported that a silvery, flashing object \"the size of a bedroom\" took off and landed on his farm Feb. 18. Knight said the object was first sighted about 4:30 a.m. as he was getting his herd out for ear- ly morning milking. He said that it was rising straight up out of the pasture when he first saw it, then it took of and went a little ways and appeared to land again. \"The last time it just went straight up-in the air and disappeared.\" Knight said the object was shiny silver color, had flashing red or orange lights, and was making a high pitched noise-real shrill, sort of a whis- tling sound. The noise and lights reportedly scattered the Battle, and scared them so badly they \"wouldn't give a drop of milk,\" according to Deputy Sheriff Joe Davenport. \"His herd dog was so scared that it took off to the house or garage or somewhere, and he never could get It to come out again.\" Davenport said, \"It wasn't any prank or fake call. He was really sincere about -it and was scared.\" The deputy added, \"I don't have any reason not to believe him.

Long be- fore it disappeared I had decided that it made no earthly sense.\" The Hodges said the object look- ed like a bowl. Mr. Hodges likened it to an orange, split in half, with the flat side up. Mrs. Hodges described the color as that of hot red coals in the middle of a wood fire. Mr. Hodges, judging by the light shed on trees be- neath the object, estimated it to be 200 to 300 feet in length. Mrs. Hodges, judging by the number of Centerview street lights it stretched across, came up with the same figure. Both said the object hovered at treetop level without any apparent movement. After seven or eight minutes the object slowly moved directly away from the witnesses with no rapid change of color, although the intensity diminished as the object moved far- ther away. 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"14 ring reports in 1973 landings By Ted Phillips MUFON Secretary As in years past, 1973 produced a number of new \"ring\" reports. In all, 14 cases involved circular landing sites, described as burnt, de- pressed, or dehydrated. One must remember the Delphos, Kansas, case in looking at the two re- ports in which the soil glowed, and the six re- ports in which a white material was found in the ring soil. The ring sites ranged from four to 42 feet in diameter. In at least four of the 1973 cases, the witnesses were within 50 feet of the landed UFO. The largest number of witnesses to a single UFO-trace event was 16. The sighting of longest duration lasted just over one hour. January 8, 1973 A freshman at East High School in Ellenboro, North Carolina, reported seeing a small object land behind his home. As it landed, a \"funny squealing noise\" was produced over a radio. The witness tried to approach the red and gold object and it ascended with a loud report. A hole was found with black particles on the snow around it. A greenish fluid filled the hole. February 9, 1973 Durban, Rhodesia, witness found a ring near his home following numerous UFO reports in the area. The ring was 10 feet in di- ameter and the perimeter was covered with a fine, brown dust. Inside there appeared another ring, covered with a gray powder. In the center of the ring, imprints. March 7, 1973 Akron, Ohio, four witnesses observed a UFO landing. The witnesses contacted police who found a burned area. April 1973 Navarre, Australia, three witnesses saw a globe of light rising over nearby trees. A 42-foot circle xras found. The soil outside the ring was dark and moist with the ring soil heavily loaded with a silvery-white sub- stance to a depth of four inches. .May, 1973 Queenstown, Africa, two witnes- ses heard a strange sound as their bedroom was illuminated by a bright glow. They found four imprints 23cm long and 15cm wide. The four im- prints form an area ten feet long and five feet wide. The grass in the area was dying and turn- ing brown. June 28, 1973 Columbia, Missouri, three witnesses observed an oval-shaped object glox^ing with a silver-white light near the ground. The object was 40 feet away at the closest point. The house lights failed two times and the tele- phone was dead for about 3 minutes. The object illuminated an area about 100 feet wide, trees a- round the object were moving violently back and forth. The observation lasted about 35 minutes. Several imprints were found, a large tree limb was twisted and pulled down. Leaves in the area turned brown and died within a few days. Leaves were burnt near the ground. 30 25 20 15 10 PHYSICAL TRACE REPORTS: MONTHLY DISTRIBUTION JAN FEE MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"A SUMMARY OF PHYSICAL TRACE REPORTS: 1973 After receiving information on nearly 2,000 UFO xeports for the period of January - December, 1973, we find that there were well over 100 reported landing cases* Of these, 57 involved physical traces.

UMBRELLA-SIIAPED DOME REPORTED BY WASHINGTON STATE WOMAN OLYMPIA, WASH, OLYMPIAN, DEC. 26, 1973—Myra R. Suaza told deputies she saw a strange flying object while driving on Interstate 5 and Jordan Road Dec. 24. She described it as oval shaped, with an umbrella-shaped dome and red and green lights. 1.7"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"sighting log On Feb. 6, 1974, (Wednesday) Miss Connie Butler called SKYNET if3 Druffel to report an object she had viewed five minutes earlier over the San Fer- nando Valley, Calif. She had called the Van Nuys police department and had been referred by Oper- ator #83. She stated she had been returning from a dance- exercise class in Woodland Hills, and was driving north toward Canoga Park when she noticed a bright white light in the northern sky. It was much brighter than a star or planet and at first she thought it was a spotlight on a sheriff's helicopter. She stopped the car to watch it when she realized it was not moving as an aircraft would do. It stayed stationary during \"two or three songs\" on the car radio. She was on a road above the houses in Woodland Kills, in hilly terrain, and the object seemed to be above Chatsworth and Simi Valley further to the northwest. The light had been steady and motionless up to this time, but it suddenly I: shot rays,\" which she described as similar to the rays a child draws around the sun. The \"rays\" were definite and very bright, and the whole object flared brighter at this time. It pulsed erratically for about 10 seconds, then began to move very slowly toward the southwest. After the rays shot out, a red color began to spread from the center, and the entire object be- came a beautiful brilliant red, and quickly as- sumed the shape of a \"cigar\" about ^ size of the full moon. She noticed a few pulsations, more regular than erratic, as the object moved away from her. As it faded into the distance the pul- sations were no longer noticeable. She watched a few minutes more (making the entire duration of sighting about 10 minutes) while it moved slowly to the southwest. Eventually it faded from view into the distance. No radio static noted. Time of sighting was 10:00 or 10:05 p.m. Wit- ness states that the edges of the cigar shape were clearly defined. She feels it was something truly strange. She is interested in UFOs from hearing her friends discuss them, and from see- ing an \"orange cone-shaped\" object a few months ago in the Mohave Desert, in the company of four friends, Sighting forms (MUFON) sent. A possible corollary to this sighting might exist in the sighting early on the morning of Feb. 6 in Ilorthridge. This is the same general area as Miss Butler's sighting, and occurred some fourteen hours before hers. A Mrs. Helen Mahan of Northridge reported to Mrs. Idabel Epperson that she had awakened between 5:30 and 6:30 a.m. and viewed a bright white light' approximately % size of the full moon. It was \"bouncing as if floating.\" She described a tiny light at the po- sition of 4:00 o'clock on the big light. This tiny light spurted out from time to time. The object moved toward the northeast and out of her sight. Duration of sighting, 20 seconds. During the entire day of February 6 there were northeasterly winds throughout the Los Angeles Basin, gusting at times up to gale force. The Mahan sighting, therefore, was reported traveling directly against the winds. The Butler sighting moved generally with the winds, and it was considered a possible flare balloon at the time it was reported. There are some aspects of the Butler case, however, which work against it being a hoax bal- loon: 1. No type of highway flare is knovm at present to the investigator that appears white first, then changes to red. Flare balloons which have been observed in this area are red from start to finish, and always maintain a brilliant \"point source\" appearance. Miss Butler reported sharply defined edges to the cigar shaped red object. 2. The deliberate, slow movement of the object after remaining stationary for several minutes is not typical of the course of hoax balloons, es- pecially in a strong wind. 3. If one considers the light \"spurting dut\" on the side of the Mahan object as being turned toward the observer, it possibly could have given the appearance of \"rays shooting out\" over the entire object, as reported by Miss Butler. Other UFO's of this same general description have been seen on successive days over the Los Angeles basin.

Although details of the case, , including the exact date of the alleged contact, are some- what sketchy at this point, it has received wide- spread publicity in the media. The following summary has been pieced together from UPI, La Nacion, the Cross Country News, the National Tattler, and other sources as the best currently available. There has been no MUFON in- vestigation of this report thus far although Joe Brill, International Coordinator for MUFON, is attempting to gather reliable information on the case. Any additional facts will be reported as they are known. The reliability of the alleged witnesses has not been checked, and no final con- clusions should be drawn from the sketchy and un- checked information available at this point. The story is as follows: A 25-year-old Argentine trucker, Dionisio Yanka, has been under treatment by a team of six doctors in Bahia Blanca (400 miles southwest of Buenos Aires) since October, 1973, after report- ing edly being taken aboard a spacecraft, according to the newspaper La Nacion. Dr. Eduardo Marta, of Bahia Blanca, was sup- posedly the first physician to treat Yanca. In a Jan. 21 interview with newsman David Day of KFJZ, Ft. Worth, Texas, Dr. Marta reportedly said (through translator Kathy Alcala) that Yanca wandered around for some time suffering from am- nesia and shock before wandering into the hospit- al and meeting Dr. Mata. Dr. Mata srid he began to treat Yanca, but could not learn what had upset hin, as the pa- tient simply would not tell his story. Finally, under hypnosis and the so-called truth drug sodium pentathol, Yanca said he had been taken a- board a spacecraft. According to Dr. Mata, Yanca has been placed under hypnosis and given sodium pentathol on num- erous occasions during a two-month period, and on each occasion his facial expression takes on ex- actly the same look, and the story is told in precisely the same way. According to La Nacion, Yanca said he spent an hour and a half aboard the spacecraft. While a- board, the craft reportedly hovered over a power line, and placed a cable on the power line \"and a- nother cable in a nearby lagoon, apparently to take on power. La Nacion said a local power company reported a sudden, sharp, and unexplained rise in electrical consumption at about the time the incident reportedly took place. La Nacion also reported that an Argentine air base near Bahia Blanca sighted a UFO on the same day Yanca was reportedly abducted. National Tattler says the sighting was by six Argentine Navy men in a control tower, who tracked the UFO for 20 minutes. They reportedly were using so- phisticated electronic tracking gear, and were certain that the object was not a plane or a sat- ellite. According to the Tattler, the incident began when Yanca stopped on a highway to fix a flat tire. He reportedly told authorities that a craft with a brilliant white light landed near him, and three creatures emerged. According to the Tat- tler, Yanca said the creatures had \"huge, bulging eyes, and they were dressed in tight-fitting jump suits when they stepped out of that strange ve- hicle.\" Yanca reportedly tried to flee, but one of the creatures placed a hand on his shoulder. \"Immediately a light hit my head and I don't re- member anything else,\" Yanca is quoted as saying. Under hypnosis, Yanca is reported by La Nacion as saying that the creatures communicated with him by humming voices which were made intelligi- ble through a loudspeaker, and that they predic- ted the Earth would suffer grave events in the future. The creatures were reportedly trying to ascertain whether man could survive in their planet's atmosphere, in another galaxy, if the Earth were destroyed. There is more detail to the story, according to Dr. Mata, but he said he was not at liberty to tell the rest of it, citing doctor-patient sec- recy relationships. The doctor reportedly said that the story, as related, appears to be true. (From information provided by Charles Kahlert, Ray Hobbs, Norma Short, and Joe Brill.) OBJECT WITH AMBER AND WHITE LIGHTS REPORTED MEAI. GROUND IN CALIFORNIA At about 12:30 a.m. on Jan. 25, at Lemoore, Calif., Charlie Kendall, the owner of a pizza parlor, reportedly spotted a round object with numerous amber and white lights about 15 to 20 feet above the ground near his home. He said he was first attracted by a hissing sound, and \"at first I thought it was a pickup truck with a spotlight on top.\" Soon after the object was spotted, it reportedly soared into the air, hissing \"like an idling jet\" and making a clicking sound \"like a bicycle when kids put cardboard against the spokes.\" He estimated that the object was about 12 feet in diameter, and said that it rotated in a clock- wise direction. Kendall, who noted that he never really put much stock in UFO's before, said the object dis- appeared after soaring into the air, but returned a few minutes later, flying back and forth in different directions, and changing altitude rap- idly before speeding off to the south. \"I have done some flying,\" he said, \"but I have never seen anything that could change al- titudes as quickly and gracefully as this thing.\" Kendall's wife and two friends were called out and they also reportedly saw the object.(Reported from a UPI dispatch) 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Astronomy Notes By Mark R.

He stepped out -:f the barn and saw that the lights were star-shaped \"with definite star points visible.\" He called his son, a col- lege senior, from the house, and they watched it move overhead. The object had a triangular shape Two points had bright red flashing lights, and the other point had a blue-green flashing light. \"All the lights blinked very, very rapidly,\" he said, \"unlike airplane lights.\" The craft had another light that appeared to be detached up a- bove the object. \"It appeared, with the light above, that the craft had some type of upper structure—like a cabin—but we could not see it,\" Meacham said. He said the object appeared to be about one-half to three-fourths of a mile high, traveling about 70 or 80 miles an hour at the maximum. \"It was motor driven and not of the normal variety,\" he said, emphasizing that it was not an airplane or helicopter or other type of aircraft he had seen before. TEXAS WOMAN' AND GRANDSON REPORT UFO HOVERING IN PASTURE CALVERT, TEXAS, TRIBUNE, DEC. 20, 1973—At about 6:30 p.m. on Dec. 11, Mrs. Nita Smitherman was driving with her four-year-old grandson, Brent, on the Old Hearne Road north of Calvert when Brent suddenly began talking about \"space men in our pasture.\" He insisted there was a space ship in their pasture near the calf pen, and when Mrs. Smitherman looked, she says she saw a strange object hovering over the pasture, blinking very bright red lights. She said she could not see the outline of the craft clearly, but that a tower type structure was visible on top, and a very intensely bright red light was on top of this structure. At each end of the craft, which appeared to be oval, were long an- tennas that seemed to gather and throw the red lights in a pulsating motion. \"The light on the west end was huge,\" she said, \"and it glowed maroon-like.\" Mrs. Smitherman pullad into her yard and went inside to tell her husband. When he came outside and neared the fence, the object \"made a whooshing sound and took off faster than the eye could follow.\" It settled down again in the distance.behind a row of trees.
