In the first are those who believe the phenomenon is a human one, in other words, that virtually all of the circles, but especially those plaguing southern England in recent years, are the product of human hoaxers. There is still some support in this camp for Terence Meaden's \"plasma-vortex hypothesis,\" but it seems to be slowly slipping. The second camp holds no clearly formulated theory of its own, it merely violently rejects the hoax and whirlwind explana- tion of events. CROP CIRCLES: SUSPECT OR MERELY CIRCUMSPECT? Indeed, the latter's own \"explanations\" are often couched in such vague terms as to be essentially mean- ingless. Here is a recent typical example, taken from a slick brochure advertising a forthcoming conference and guided tour of the circles: \"In spite of the contro- versy, one thing cannot be denied—when confronted with these overwhelmingly large symbols, one feels a sense of awe, and the knowledge that 'we are not alone.' There is some extraordinary mystery behind the crop cir- cles, and whenever the source is truly recognized, it will be something of earth-shaking consequence...You will be able to walk into the fields and step into these circles, to experience the thrilling vortex of energy that created them. This energy is particularly strong in the newly created 'Crop Circles.'\" Needless to say, the \"thrilling vortex\" the organizers have in mind is not the same one Meaden and his band of merry meteorologists—or the hoaxers-only theo- rists—have in theirs. Cereology as such is not wholly to blame for the current confusion, but certainly it has to shoulder its share of the blame. For the most part— which is the better part of a decade—it has been long on speculation and short on science. And much of its \"sci- ence\" has been suspect to say the least, the most glaring example being been the \"crystallized energy patterns\" turned up by an English homeopathic laboratory and summarily publicized in Crop Circles: The Latest Evidence, by Pat Delgado and Colin Andrews, the fol- low-up to their international bestseller, Circular Evidence. The best the second camp can do is to say that the Circles are so fundamentally strange and unique that a \"higher intelligence\" of some sort must of necessity be involved, though the nature of that intelligence remains studiously undefined. Suffice it to say, again, that the paranormalists aren't talking human intelligence here. The mere assumption of intelligent behavior, however, sets off its own inevitable chain of speculation. If the Circles are intelligently created, then the shapes thus formed must be an attempt at communication, i.e., the symbols themselves must represent some sort of lan- guage. Consequently, the Circlemakers must be trying to tell us something, but what? And here agreement breaks down. As it turns out, one person's guess is as good, better or worse than another's. The Circles have been interpreted as both signs of doom and prophecies of promise, as the earth goddess Gaia crying her heart out, as warnings against pollution and other human evils, as both harbingers of coming cosmic changes and as heralds of the end of the world. They've been dowsed, plumbed, channeled and psychedelicized, not to mention associated with everything from ancient ley lines and stone henges/circles, to UFOs, Wilhelm Reich's orgone energy, poltergeists and mysterious ani- mal mutilations. Depending on who you talk to, their residual \"energy\" can either heal the sick or make lame the healthy. Even Star Wars and the hapless Hopi Indians have been hauled into the Crop Circle debate at one time or another. From my own now slightly jaundiced viewpoint, I can only say this with any approximation of certainty: Everyone can't possibly be right. What we need is less speculation, not more. To that end we are reprinting several excerpts from the just released Report on the Results of Project Argus, edited by Michael Chorost. Partly funded by MUFON, Argus represents one of the most ambitious scientific undertakings yet in terms of overall Crop Circle phenomenology. Its findings — some of which are only provisional at best — will be strenuously debated in the months and years to come. The key concept to keep in mind, how- ever, is this: Argus found no obvious \"smoking gun\" that would definitively separate the wheat from the chaff. It did turn up an interesting avenue or two deserving of fu- ture research. We hope these will be pursued. We also hope, in the meantime, that they won't be blown out of all proportion by the paranormal camp. — Dennis Stacy AUGUST 1993 NUMBER 304 PACE 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL PROJECT ARGUS REPORT No smoking gun yet, but hints of microscopic & magnetic anomalies keep the crop circle wheel turning By Michael Chorost I n the summer of 1992, Project Argus investigated one of the most remarkable mysteries of the century, the sudden and baffling appearance of hundreds of huge, magnificent shapes — dubbed \"crop circles\" — in the fields of England each summer. Made of grain flat- tened methodically to the ground in intricate patterns, they were a form of landscape art which quickly at- tracted worldwide attention. But the \"artist\" was un- known. Where did they come from? What agent or force routinely generated them overnight? Could they be products of something other than human activity? It seemed appropriate to seek to answer such questions with the instruments and methods of science. Project Argus was preceded by at least three attempts to study the phenomenon with scientific instruments. There were the \"White Crow\" and \"Blackbird\" surveil- lance watches organized by Colin Andrews and Pat Delgado in 1989 and 1990, which used night-vision video cameras and human observers in an effort to cap- ture the formation of a crop circle on film. And there was Project \"Blue Hill,\" mounted by Terence Meaden in 1991 in conjunction with Japanese universities to detect evidence of \"plasma vortices\" (Meaden's proposed nat- urally occurring causative mechanism) by radar. The goal of all three was to record a crop circle event at the moment of formation. None succeeded as their orga- nizers had hoped, although all came up with a small amount of equivocal data which could be interpreted as \"hints\" that a non-hoaxed phenomenon had been ob- served. Project Argus had the different objective of making a minute and extensive study of the soil and crops after an event had occurred. Without requiring prior assump- tions about the agent which might be at work, it made a sustained and well-instrumented investigation of a large number of events, undeterred by the probability that some would be hoaxes (and, indeed, sampling from known and suspected hoaxes for comparison). It drew together a number of physicists, biologists, and engi- neers, several of whom were prepared to accept that we might merely be witnessing the traces of human ac- tivity and/or \"blind\" natural forces, but whom were ready to lend their expertise for no more than the cost of travel and accommodation. Briefly stated, the project's goal was to learn if some crop circles exhibited physical effects which would be difficult, if not impossible, to generate by casual human activity. Indications that there might be such effects in the form of short-lived radioactive residues in the soil and significant changes to the crops had turned up late in 1991, thanks largely to the dedicated work of Marshall Dudley and Dr. W.C. Levengood. Slenderly based though these indications were, it was a scientific im- perative to follow them up on as large a scale as could be managed, using better equipment and a more exhaustive methodology. P roject Argus was a joint effort initiated mainly by two organizations, the North American Circle (NAC) and the Centre for Crop Circle Studies (CCCS.) The CCCS was established in 1990 in England with the aim of encouraging orderly scientific investigation. The NAC was established a year later in the United States, with the same goal. By the end of 1991, it was becoming clear that the two organizations had, between them, accumulated enough scientific expertise to de- sign and carry out a joint research project. The CCCS gave the project £2,000 as seed money and committed it- self to logistical support, and a fundraising drive by the NAC brought the total funding to over $34,000 by May 1992. Significant contributions were made in particular by the Robert Bigelow Holding Corporation, the Fund for UFO Research and MUFON. Logistical needs such as housing and ground transportation were quickly arranged, and the project formally began its fieldwork in England on July 9th, 1992. Project Argus's array of experimental instruments and methods was as follows: • Electron microscopy to examine plant cell walls for evidence of unusual physical stresses or heat-related damage. • Gamma spectroscopy to examine soil for short- lived radioactive isotopes. • Gel electrophoresis to examine plant DNA for ev- idence of denaturation. • Fluxgate magnetometry to assess magnetic varia- tions in soil. • Studies of plant cell tissue to assess the effects of the flattening force on the plants. • Seed germinatioll trials to test growth rates of seeds harvested within crop formations. • A scintillation counter and geiger counter to detect abnormally high levels of ambient radiation. • Various electromagnetic field detectors. • Visual analysis of \"crop lays\" for comparison of crop circles in different nations. • Recording of daily rainfall to correlate formation dates with weather conditions. PAGE 4 NUMBER 304 AUGUST 1993"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL No smoking gun that would absolutely rule out human Involvement was found, but Irregularities were discovered that are definitely worth pursuing. • Recordkeeping of reports of unidentified luminous aerial phenomena. • Support of surveillance and surveying operations. • Recordkeeping of dates and locations of forma- tions. The first six of these objectives were accomplished with instruments situated in laboratories in the U.S. and U.K., using samples collected and processed by the Project Argus team. The rest were performed on-site by team members using the appropriate equipment. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS Project Argus has not, at this writing, found the \"smok- ing gun\" clearly showing that some crop circles are not the product of human activity. But it has ruled out sev- eral previously held hypotheses and, potentially more importantly, discovered some apparent regularities which seem well worth following up. What it has found are the following (each is discussed in greater detail in the 115- page Report on the Results of Project Argus: An Instrumented Study of the Physical Materials of Crop Circles, edited by Michael Chorost, and available from North American Circle (NAC): A. A greater incidence of microscopic \"blisters\" on plants inside crop circles than in controls outside them. It is not yet clear whether this is due to the fact that the plants inside the formation experienced a different regime of temperature and humidity than the controls, or to some more exotic cause (e.g. a \"genuine\" phenome- non). A number of unusual molds and types of cellular damage were also detected. B. No evidence of anomalous radioactive traces in any of the tested formations. C. No evidence of anomalous DNA degradation in any of the tested formations. D. Results indicating that further testing with fluxgate magnetometers may be productive, with due attention given to potential sources of methodological error. Experiments appeared to show that soil within many of the formations tested had a higher degree of magnetic flux intensity than the soil outside them. Notably, the one known hoax we were able to test did not show this ef- fect. E. The possibility that there are significant anomalies in plant cell tissues and seed germination rates relative to controls. Due to the complexity of living plant systems, and the methodological difficulties imposed by collect- ing samples under highly variable conditions, this re- search has progressed especially slowly. F. Hints that testing with electromagnetic detectors may be productive. The ad hoc nature of the testing in 1992 makes it necessary to undertake better testing in future seasons. G. The continuing presence of complex crop lays in formations in England and Canada. Formations in both countries exhibited features such as standing stalks, un- derlying lays, off-axis centers, and plant braiding. H. Rainfall data suggesting that some of the formations in the immediate vicinity of Alton Barnes may have been made during or immediately after wet weather, which complicates the hoax theory. I. Several accounts of unidentified luminous events in the low atmosphere resembling those which have been described (occasionally with photographic collateral) in Dr. Terence Meaden's Journal of Meteorology and John Macnish's video Crop Circle Communique. J. No success in photographic surveillance. A formation which was made within the theoretical range of the camera went undetected, probably due to low light and an unfavorable camera-to-ground angle. K. The continuing existence of the phenomenon itself, in considerable numbers. George Wingfield's database lists 197 formations for Great Britain for the summer of 1992 (published in Report as Appendix 11). W e thus have some potentially very interesting and significant data from our magnetic flux scans and electron microscopy, and it is our hope that outside scientists competent in these areas will review our data and make comments. The absence of positive data in the other test regimes does not mean that the phenomenon must be a hoax. As the old adage goes, absence of evidence does not mean evidence of absence. It is entirely possible that we were, in those cases, looking for a real phenomenon in the wrong places. There were thousands of tests we could have run, but we could only select a few out of that huge set. When facing the unknown, one must essentially start anywhere, since no prior research exists to indicate the most productive paths. In (probably) ruling out ra- dioactivity and several other effects, the project did es- sential work which will save its successors considerable time and expense. AUGUST 1993 NUMBER 304 PAGES"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL \"LUMINOSITY\" REPORTS By Ralph Noyes Project Argus received a number of reports of uniden- tified luminous aerial phenomena: 1. This story was told to us by one of the barmaids at the Barge Inn, a pub at the south end of Alton Barnes. She related seeing an oddly moving, low-level red light to the south of the pub late one evening about the week- end of July 11/12. It seemed to have been accosted by a helicopter (thought to be military) and \"shot off at great speed. On the following day police, visibly (and unusually) carrying arrest gear (truncheons, handcuffs) called at the pub and were said to have \"been active\" in the neighbourhood. 2. A \"structured craft\" was reported seen hovering over a field to the west of Woodborough Hill, not far from Honey Street. This was told to us by Stephen Greet and two women who were with him. The \"craft\" was said to have responded to flashed beams of light. The time and date told us by Greer was 0030 on the morning of Monday, July 27th. This event has been re- ported in detail by Chris Mansell in The Circular, vol. 3, no. 3 (October 1992), pp. 79. The Argus team subse- quently investigated a crop circle discovered in the im- mediate vicinity on July 30th (referred to in the lab notes as the \"Woodborough Hill\" or \"Carson Farm Canal\" formation.) Samples were collected for gamma spectroscopy (to be performed at Harwell), DNA analy- sis, magnetic susceptibility tests, seed germination tests, and tissue studies, etc. The DNA analysis and magnetic susceptibility tests were negative; the other test results have not yet come in. 3. Stephen Greer also said that about an hour later there was another sighting of an (unstructured) \"orange globe\" to the south. When I suggested that this might have been an army flare (it was certainly seen above the skyline), the witness Sandra claimed that it \"responded\" to light signals when they flashed at it. 4. We have a third-hand story that on the evening of July 22nd, round about dusk, people standing on Woodborough Hill on what seems to have been the first night of Greer's watch, saw a small, white object below the skyline in the direction of Milk Hill, roughly where the \"God's Telephone\" event was reported the following day on David Read's farm. In addition, the team leader (Michael Chorost) spoke to two policemen from the nearby town of Pewsey, who related having seen odd flashing lights immediately above the field, though they were not sure of the exact date of their sighting. They felt sure that it could not have been flashlights; one suggested, tentatively, that the lights seemed to have been rotating. 5. By far the best account of a luminosity is that given by John and Julie Wakefield (no relation to Grant Wakefield.) The two were members of the \"Dreadlock\" team who were controlling entry to the \"Snail\" forma- tion in East Field on the Carson farm. On the evening of Tuesday, July 28, they had driven their van toward Pewsey and parked a little way round the corner at about Ordnance Survey reference 130 623. They had done so in order to find a quiet moment away from the other Dreadlocks to moke a tape-recorded letter to some friends. The time was about 10:15 p.m. Rising from a patch of woodland towards the south (probably Wilcot Withy Bed), they saw an orange globe, apparently self- luminous and well below the skyline. After a short while this object ejected another, much smaller globe of orange light, which moved to the west and performed a gyration before returning to the \"parent\" globe. No sound was heard. The \"parent\" globe then winked out. Some minutes later, the same globe (or, conceivably, an- other one) was seen rising from Tawsmead Copse, fur- ther west and nearer to the road where John and Julie were parked. This, too, sent out a smaller orange object. Three helicopters (presumed to be military) rapidly ap- peared from the south and converged on the object(s), which abruptly disappeared. This final event happened around 10:40 p.m. There are some associated events: A. On the following day, July 29th. the Argus team was told of the presence of two crop circle events on West Stowell Farm, about 2 miles north of the previous night's sighting. It seems quite likely that they were formed during the night of July 28/29th. The Argus team collected soil samples on July 30th for radiation testing and magnetic variance. The radiation tests were negative. The magnetic variance tests' results are not yet in. (The formation is referred to as the \"Draycot Fitz Payne I\" formation in the lab notes.) Plant samples were collected by John and Julie Wakefield on the 29th and sent to labs for electron microscope examination of the tissues and DNA analysis. These revealed nothing out of the ordinary. B. Making enquires in the neighborhood of West Stowell Farm during July 29th, John and Julie were told that there had been some disturbance among ani- mals at about the time of their sighting the previous evening. They were also given the unusual story that, at about the time of the apparent intervention by the heli- copters, a closed-circuit intercom system (a \"granny alarm\") in use at Draycot Manor Cottage (which lies be- tween the site of their sighting and the site of the crop circle events) was heard by Mr. Kenneth Bryant — the PAGE 6 NUMBER 304 AUGUST 1993"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL \"granny watcher\" that evening — to, utter the words, \"Caution, police\" or something similar. C. I made enquires myself in the neighborhood by a door-to-door canvass on July 30th. I had three inde- pendent reports of a dog howling at Draycot Cottages at about 11 p.m. on the evening of July 28th (but no reports of other animal disturbance.) Mr. Kenneth Bryant's story was given to me again by his wife, though she had not been present at the event herself. 6. On another occasion, the night of July 22/23, John and Julie saw an orange globe low in the sky towards the west. This was also seen by two other observers, Kevin and Kate, using a night sight (image intensifier). The sighting lasted for about 5 minutes while the object moved slowly from south to north. Kevin and Kate re- port that it was, on occasion, below the skyline. Through the night sight a pulsating center, not visible to the naked eye, could be detected within the much larger, hazy, orange \"envelope.\" High in the sky at about the same time Kevin and Kate also saw two small red lights moving in a manner which suggested they were not aircraft. 7. Two members of the Project Argus team, Simon Lyons and Michael Chorost, saw an aerial object which, if an airplane, was an unusual one. The following is Chorost's description of it: We saw it on the night of August 17th-18th, at around 1 a.m. on a calm, cool, cloudy night. The object traveled at about the same speed and appeared to be about the same size as one would expect of a low-flying airplane. However, it made no sound. Visually, the object looked like a collection of brightly and irregularly flashing lights. I can perhaps best describe it by saying it looked like an airplane with too many running lights which were flashing too fast, and furthermore jumping around the \"body\" of the object between sets of flashes. Each \"set\" of flashes (and there were several sets of flashes going on simultaneously) appeared to start with one or two bright flashes, and then settle down into a steady stream of dimmer flashes before stopping. The fact that several sets of flashes were always going on at one time made the object appear to have a \"syncopated\" rhythm of flashing lights. There was no discernible pat- tern, though I would have said that there was a fast rhythm. I would guess that there were three or four sets of flashes going on at any given time. The flashes were white and yellow, which made it seem less likely that they were ordinary running lights. We both examined the object through low-power binoculars, but could not gain any extra information on the object's shape. I had the fleeting impression that the lights could have been dimly illuminating some part of the object's surface at its apparent \"bottom.\" Through the night sight a pulsating center, not visi- ble to the naked eye, could be detected within the much larger, hazy, orange \"envelope.\" The object traveled in a straight line through the sky from west to east. Toward the east, it disappeared in a bank of clouds before it reached the horizon. It was visible for about two minutes. Several members of the Argus team, including my- self, had seen a similar object several weeks earlier, during a nightwatch from the top of Woodborough Hill. It had taken the same trajectory and moved at the same speed. It. too, made no sound. Busty Taylor, an experi- enced pilot, had been unable to identify the object. Both Simon and I had seen many airplanes, heli- copters, and satellites during our summer at Alton Barnes. What we saw did not appear to be any of those things. Ralph Noyes Is the Honourable Secretary of the Centre for Crop Circle Studies and was the Centre's liaison with Project Argus. He Is also a past contrib- utor to these pages. UPDATE The articles by Chorost, Noyes, McDonough and Deetken which appear in this issue have been reprinted from the Report on the Results of Project Argus: An Instrumented Study of the Physical Materials of Crop Circles, edited by Michael Chorost, of which they rep- resent but a small portion. Ordering information for the complete 115-page report, partially funded by MUFON, can be found on page 13. While reports are sketchy as we go to press, it's clear that crop circles continue to appear in England this summer, although, seemingly less concentrated in the Alton Barnes/Wiltshire area than they were last year. In other developments, Lord John Haddington, patron of the Centre for Crop Circle Studies, and George Wingfield, formerly the Centre's director of field in- vestigations and the editor of The Circular, have re- portedly purchased The Cerealogist, previously edited by John Michell. Presumably, Wingfield will take over as editor, beginning with the #10 (Harvest) issue. How many of the celebrated English circles are the product of human hoaxing remains a matter of some controversy, sure to be exacerbated by the publication of Jim Schabel's Round in Circles (London, Hamish Hamilton), to be reviewed in a future issue of this jour- nal. The latter is part history, part confessional, as Schnabel admits to having hoaxed several circle forma- tions on his own. AUGUST 1993 NUMBER 304 PAGE 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Blow-up of cover photograph Discussion of Anomalies: Blisters The most dramatic of the structural effects is the formation of the blisters, the cause of which may be due to several conditions: 1) some unforeseen and unreported weathering effect that is common to wheat, 2) a systemic reaction by the plant tissues to being in a lodged position, 3) the result of microbial action, or 4) a physical reaction to whatever forces formed the circle. The origin and/or cause of this force is unknown, and cannot be discerned from the data at hand. The fact that the blisters appear on some of the control samples does not preclude the possibility that the forces which created the circle formation also created the blisters; the controls were generally taken 30 paces in all directions away from the formation, and thus could have been exposed to the force in a collateral manner, resulting in partial modification of the plant. By the same token, however, the presence of blisters on the controls forces the consid- eration that the blisters are a normal structural characteristic of wheat that has been heretofore undocumented in the literature. Each possibility carries equal weight. The possibility that the blisters are produced by heat or electromagnetic radiation cannot be overlooked, but neither can it be proven. There was no physical evidence of starch granule dam- age found in any of the samples and no carbonization present to indicate extremely hot tem- peratures in the environment. With no evidence to back it up, the heat theory is just another pos- sibility. It must be noted that, in some cases, storage carbohydrates in the form of starch granules are located inside the hypoderm cells, and at times these granules can press out against the cell walls, creating the distinct impression of a rounded body in the pericarp. Although in the pic- tures displayed here, this situation is not an explanation for what is seen, the protrusion of starch granules from the pericarp is common and should be considered when interpreting data of this kind. — Cassandra McDonough PAGES NUMBER 304 AUGUST 1993"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL COMPARISON OF BRITISH & CANADIAN CROP CIRCLE LAYS As it turns out, crop circles aren't the same world round in terms of complexity, numbers and other traits. By Chad Deetken I n addition to the test conducted in the fields and labs, a comprehensive physical description of the forma- tions was needed. Unusual and complex features may provide insight into the nature of the creative en- ergy. Because I had three years of experience investi- gating Canadian crop circles, I was chosen to undertake these observations and compare features from both countries whenever relevant. Making my findings public gives rise to a dilemma. Positive results from electronic surveillance or lab- analysis would be difficult if not impossible for hu- mans to duplicate. However, by giving details of phys- ical anomalies, there was a chance that hoaxers could master some of these features and use them to confuse or discredit researchers. In the end though, we decided to make available all evidence which we believe to be significant. In assessing the following information, it should be noted that my observations in both England and Canada were made late in the season when plant growth had vir- tually ceased. This fact is important because, after a certain point in their growth stage, crops progressively lose the capacity to recover (e.g. straighten up again) af- ter having been flattened. Early in the growing season the plants are green, supple and still active, while late in the season they have become dry, brittle, and unable to recover after being physically damaged. I have not found visual appearance to be a determin- ing factor of authenticity. However, I am inclined to believe that the more features a formation displays, the higher the likelihood of it being genuine. GENERAL FEATURES Pattern of Lay From the perspective of overall appearance, there are two types of crop formations. The first is one in which stalks are pressed so neatly and evenly to the ground they look as though they have been groomed into place. This formation glistens and glimmers in the sunlight, dramatically emphasizing the pattern of lay. Others dis- play an unruly or untidy look. Stalks have partially sprung up again or never properly went down in the first place. They do not flow perfectly parallel to each other nor do they lie at the same height which allows soil to show through. Some factors that may account for this appearance are the type and density of the crop, humidity at the time of the event and quality of soil. Uneven, insufficient or ex- cessive application of the energy involved in the circle making process may also dramatically affect appear- ance. A possible example of excessive energy occurred at Alvena, Saskatchewan in 1990. This 11 foot circle with a \"doughnut\" of standing crop in the center had charac- teristics which suggested chaos. The application of en- ergy seemed to have been so excessive that the stalks were pressed abnormally flat to the ground, \"accor- dioned\" into lightning-bolt configurations, and woven into one another so that no direction of swirl was dis- cernible (diagram 1).* The circle was distinctly darker than the surrounding field. Unfortunately, no lab facili- ties were available at the time to determine if the dark- ening was due to charring or fungal growth. Sequence of Construction It would seem logical that the steps of construction, particularly in a large formation, should follow a ratio- nal sequence. Sequence can be determined by noting which stalks are on top of others at the points where paths, rings and circles intersect. For instance, in a for- mation involving numerous circles joined by paths, the process should begin at one end and finish at the other, or perhaps, start in the middle and work toward the ends. Frequently, this is not the case. One is more likely to find the process starting at a random point, skipping back and forth, adding a circle here, a path there, a ring over there. Imagine an artist painting a picture. Rather than executing the work in one continuing stroke, the artist will lift the brush numerous times, adding details here and there until the painting is completed. The order of construction may vary from for- mation to formation but the implications are of a se- quence, unlike one a person working on the ground would choose to follow. Last year's findings by Chorost and Stanley Morcom that \"construction lines\" under the lay do not follow a ra- tional sequence, support the above observations. Although I saw no signs of complex construction lines this year in England, I did find many cases of paths or narrow bands running under the circle lay. Some ended at the center of the circles while others stopped part way, often narrowing to a point. Construction lines in Canada are nonexistent because formations tend to be fairly simple. * Due to space considerations, not all of the original ac- companying diagrams or photographs have been repro- duced here. AUGUST 1993 NUMBER 304 PAGE 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Diagram 2 Standing Stalks This is a fairly common feature both in England and Canada but was especially prevalent in Albertan cir- cles in 1991. Instead of all stalks being pressed down, varying numbers of single stems are somehow unaf- fected by the circle making process and left standing. The number of standing stalks can range from just a few to many hundreds. They are not set in any sort of a pattern such as a spiral, or in certain areas of the circle but are randomly dispersed throughout the formation. In a set of four 17 to 38 foot diameter circles at Warner, Alberta in 1991, many hundreds of standing stalks were found in each (diagram 2). Obviously, the greater the number of individual standing stalks, the less distance between them. Anyone attempting to cre- ate this effect using an implement would have to use a very narrow one indeed since the stems in some forma- tions stand just inches apart. There is little chance that stalks knocked down this late in the season could have stood up again. A stalk at harvest time is dry and brittle, its head heavy with seed. Once it goes down, the severity of the kink at the point of bend in addition to the weight of its seeds, eliminates any possibility that it could stand again, by whatever means. Stalks Bent Above Ground Level Clusters of stems or individual stalks are sometimes left standing but are bent at heights ranging from several inches to as much as a foot or more above ground. Often the bent portions point in a direction other than that of the swirl (diagram 3). This feature is commonly found in circles both in Canada and England. Humps Occasionally one discovers an area where the lay ap- pears to flow over an object such as a rock or a clump of soil. However, on lifting or parting the stalks, nothing but a pocket of air is found. More commonly found in England and more noticeable when the lay is thick. Diagram 3 Standing Rows at Tram Lines Where tram lines intersect crop formations, one often sees a single row of standing stems along the edge of the tire tracks (diagram 5). It is not a factor in Canada since there are no tram lines. Ovoid and Off-Axis Formations Most circles and rings are imperfect. That is, they appear as though they were drawn freehand, slightly out of round or off center. Sometimes the imperfection is extreme. In Lethbridge, Alberta in 1991, one of three circles in an L- shaped formation was found to be extremely el- liptical. Although the circle was otherwise well formed, it measured 13 feet in length but only 9 feet across. In Albertville, Saskatchewan in 1992, a ringed circle measuring 36 feet in diameter was only 2 inches out of round. However, its axis was completely off center. From the swirl center to the outer perimeter of the ring measured 21 feet, while the distance from the same center in the opposite direction was only 15 feet. Another peculiarity was that the width of the ring was 27 inches at the \"heavy\" side of the formation, but only 15 inches at the \"light\" side. It was as if a round fluid object spinning on its axis had become unbalanced, causing the bulk of the contents to go to one side (diagram 6). Gap Seeking When formations are intersected by trams or bordered by areas of wind damage, the flattened stalks from the formation will tend to enter the gap area. This phenom- enon was first noted by Delgado and Andrews in the mid 1980s. One could imagine that the creating energy is like a sphere of compressed air that moves in a straight line to make a path or rotates to create a circle. As it passes over PAGE 10 NUMBER 304 AUGUST 1993"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Diagram 5 a gap in the standing stalks, such as a tram, the com- pressed air has a tendency to escape into this avenue of lesser pressure, pulling some of the stems with it. This feature is commonly seen in English crop circles whereas in Canada it is limited to the occasional excep- tionally wide drill row. Bands Many circles display a band of stalks around their perimeters distinct from the rest of the lay. The width of the band can be from a few inches to several feet and may swirl in the same direction as the rest of the circle or contrary to it. Bands appear almost like a wreath around the outside of a circle. While circle patterns may range from radial to tight swirls, the stalks in a band lie parallel to the circle perimeter. I have seen some bands on top of the circle lay while others are found un- derneath. (See photo next page.) The most recent formation in Albertville, Saskatchewan was a classic example of a band laying on top. The circle was swirled counterclockwise with a 6\" wide band in the same direction laid on top like a wreath. At Draycot Fitz Payne n, the band ran in the op- posite direction. There was no overlapping of lay, though there were areas of turmoil like that of opposing water currents occasionally swirling into each other. Bare Tram Lines Normally, when tractor trams intersect a formation, they are covered by the fallen stalks of crop. However, I have seen a number of cases in which tram lines inter- secting a formation are not covered over by fallen stalks. Two good examples were at the Tawsmead Copse \"Venus\" formation and the Ogbourne St. George for- mation. To achieve this effect, the stems nearest the edge of the tramline, which normally would be laying across, instead have gone down parallel to it. Stalks Diagram 6 progressively further away from the tram lie at increas- ing angles until they are again consistent with the rest of the lay. Multiple'Layering Multiple layering is a common phenomenon and varies in complexity from two to five or more layers. Simple examples are when a path flows over or under another feature, creating two layers. Sometimes when lifting the surface layer of stalks, one finds another layer run- ning in a different direction underneath. In more complex examples such as at Ogbourne St. George, I found as many as five different layers. These were not like sheets, one on top of the other, but rather individual bunches of stems lying in different direc- tions, intertwined or interwoven with each other. The best way to describe this is to say it is much like the weaving of cloth. It is difficult to understand how this ef- fect could be achieved as a random natural act. A pre- viously mentioned example of individual stems, not bunches, woven in this manner was found at Alvena, Saskatchewan. Areas of \"Turbulence\" Another significant feature is the occasional discovery of areas of varying sizes which show varying amounts of \"turbulence.\" In one such area at the Tawsmead Copse \"Venus\" formation it seemed as if something physical had interfered with the general flow of the wheat, much like a rock would alter the flow of a stream. The distur- bance appeared in a large area adjacent to a section of wind damage and where the lay crossed a tram line. In the center of this area of turbulence was a thick pile of wheat heads created by stems all falling toward one point so that the heads lay in a heap.

CAUSES FOR SUSPICION A priority when arriving at a new formation is to ascer- tain whether one is the first to enter. Sometimes evidence is found which casts doubt on the authenticity of a for- mation. While suspicious evidence does not rule out authenticity, it reduces the inclination to invest a large amount of time and energy on sampling and analysis. A case in point is the Draycot Fitz Payne II formation at West Stowell Farm. Upon arriving, we noticed a nar- row path through ten feet of standing crop between a roadway and a tram which one had to reach in order to access the field. Entering the formation, we noted the features were not impressive. The lay was not flat to the ground, giving it a messy appearance. In the center of the circle was a bare spot looking as though it had been thoroughly walked on, although there were no dis- cernible footprints. Also, a thin ring of standing stalks several feet in from the edge of the circle looked as though an implement had rolled around the perimeter, accidentally leaving this strip standing. Most suspicious of all were splotches of mud on the surface of the flattened plants in the key and around a portion of the circle. The soil was quite soft the night the event occurred because of a steady rain. The splotches were spaced at regular intervals and indicative of left foot, right foot placement. It is conceivable these marks were made by an animal. More likely though, they were left by a person who either created the formation or walked into it in the early morning. In any case, the combination of these signs ruled out spending much more time here. FORMATIONS WITH SINGULAR PECULIARITIES The \"Phantom Tractor\" One day we received a report of strange tractor turns in the middle of a field near Milk Hill. After flying over it with Busty Taylor, we decided it warranted closer ex- amination. What farmer, after all, would needlessly make turns in the middle of his field, thereby causing unnecessary damage to his crop? Upon entering the field it became evident that these were not tractor turns at all but the circle makers imi- tating a tractor. The lay was perfect, the stems were not crushed and we found no impressions of any kind in the soil. Had a tractor been involved, tire imprints would have been quite prominent in the soft soil. Also, the curvature of the turns did not quite match those made by real tractors at the end of fields. Here, when a tractor makes too wide a turn, the stalks are severely crushed and not pushed down in a neat pattern. Tire imprints are easily noticed. This formation, which was only yards away from an earlier formation, was also closely exam- ined by Montague Keen and Ralph Noyes, among oth- ers. From his own farming experience, Keen strongly endorses these comments, and could see no way in which the markings could be reconciled either with ra- tional farming procedure or the physical limitations and functions of turning tractors. A Cleared \"Black Line \" at a Formation at Whitchurch In a Celtic Cross formation at Whitchurch, I found a thin dark line just a few inches wide beginning at the edge of the formation and meandering across the entire length of the field. Closer examination showed that along this line, most of the stalks had been severed at a 45 degree angle. What made the line so visible is that the cut edges, the severed portions and some stems left standing had turned black. Nearby stalks broken by animals or other causes however, had not blackened. Electron microscopy indi- cated the blackening was due to fungal growth, and that the cuts were probably from animal teeth. The \"FlattenedPorcupine\" Formation At the end of August, 1992 near the village of Milestone, Saskatchewan, farmer Joseph Rennick dis- covered an irregular rectangular formation 22 by 63 feet in his wheat field. It looked as though a round object about 22 feet in diameter had come down at an angle and skipped like a flat stone on water, leaving three PAGE 12 NUMBER 304 AUGUST 1993"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL rough impressions. He had never seen a crop circle be- fore and suspected the cause to be wind damage. He be- came more intrigued when he noticed the affected area had a counterclockwise swirl. Then, something even stranger caught his eye. There, in the middle of the formation, lay a very flat and very dead porcupine. It bore no signs of wounds or physical damage but had obviously been pressed down by a weight or powerful force. He estimated the animal had lain there for at least 7 days but showed no sign of decomposition and did not smell. A mature porcupine weighs about 25 Ib. and stands at least 12 inches tall. This one had been pressed three inches thick, its legs extending out like an \"x\". Furthermore, a skid mark in the soil embedded with broken quills showed the creature had been dragged by force from the perimeter of the formation into the center. Its quills were oriented in the same direction as the swirled wheat. At the time of this discovery, the soil in the field was soft and muddy but in the formation, it was so hard that it was difficult to dig into the soil with a trowel. It appeared that it had been dried out. The imprint of each stem was clearly visible in the hard ground. Furthermore, the crops in the field were still slightly green and the seeds very full, yet in the formation the stalks were dry and brittle and the seeds shriveled like raisins. Unfortunately, by the time Mr. Rennick notified me or thought of having an autopsy done on the porcupine, it had decomposed too much to be of any value. However, plant, quill and soil samples are presently being analyzed in laboratories. One may wonder why after 10 years of not finding dead animals in crop formations, suddenly there are several cases (an incident in 1989 involving a dead but not flattened porcupine in a crop circle, not far from the current case, has just come to light). The answer may lie in the fact that the unfortunate victims are porcupines. Most animals, given the slightest warning of impending danger, will fly or scurry away. The porcupine, however, stays put, relying on its sharp quills for defense. The Severed Circle At the time of this writing (Nov. 18, 1992), a new addi- tion to the original formation was discovered. This was a horseshoe shape about 15 feet by 30 feet, and less than 7 days old, placed adjacent to the original formation. In early November 1990 farmer Mike Shawaga of Alvena, Saskatchewan reported to me that he had just discovered another circle near his house (diagram 13). I had been there two months before studying 5 eleven foot circles, each with a \"donut\" of standing crop in the cen- ter . This one had a new twist. It was the same size as the others, but instead of the \"donut\" center, it had standing crop which came to a Diagram 13 wirt »a er 'f point like a cone. Also, instead of a chaotic woven lay. it was neatly swirled. The odd thing about this circle was that it had \"come down\" on a barbed wire fence which divided it into 1/3 and 2/3 portions. The 1/3 section which should have been on the other side of the fence, had instead been sev- ered and reattached to the opposite side of the 2/3 por- tion. In addition, it must have \"flipped over\" because its swirl was clockwise, compared to the counterclockwise direction of the larger portion.

It is part of a vast military reserve in cen- tral Nevada, where the country's most advanced aircraft, including the U-2 and SR-71 spy planes, have been flight-tested, using the long runway at Groom Lake. Since 1989 and the release of Robert Lazar's story of back-engineered alien spacecraft at Area S-4, a few miles south of Groom Lake at the base of the Papoose Mountains, hundreds of visitors have come to the Little Ale'Inn in Rachel, Nevada, and what is called the Mailbox Road to look for the glowing lights of UFOs that appear beyond the Jumbled Hills.

She had several encounters with alien life forms at her house near Rosamond, California, at the base of the Tehachapi Mountains. She remembers having an encounter in June 1990 with a small cardboard-colored entity resembling a Gray. This entity was wearing a form-fitting one-piece black suit. She was standing on the stairs of her sum- mer deck arguing with this entity in the early hours of the morning. It was neither her first or last encounter. I have detailed some of her experiences in the January 1992 issue of this Journal. I have had one or two encounters of my own. The most distinctive took place on May 8, 1981 in Arizona. I remember three little white-skinned beings appearing at the foot of my bed while I was in a hypnogogic state. When they departed suddenly, a pungent odor of ozone permeated the air of the bed- room. I have been investigating abductions since 1976 and am familiar with many types of experience with various entities. However, never did I dream that Pamela and I would experience missing time together! I am well aware that abduction reports have gener- ated a backlash from the public sector from authorities like Carl Sagan and Dr. Robert Baker. They would like to dismiss these encounters as hypnopompic hal- lucinations or some other almost reasonable psycho- logical category in order to avoid dealing with the possibility of physical events which carry much more profound implications. I am also aware of the fact that witness exposure to UFO material tends to \"contami- nate\" the individual's recounting of events and lessens the value of witness testimony. In that case, one may consider that my testimony is super-contaminated by a background of 40 years researching this subject. On the other hand one might also consider that I have had 40 years to observe, reflect on, and evaluate UFO experiences. Bearing this in mind, then, here is our story. BRIGHT LIGHTS OVER THE DESERT Pamela and I headed for Rachel, Nevada on Tuesday, March 16, 1993. After stopping in Las Vegas to pick up Ektar 1000 high-speed film for my camera from the Camera Center on Eastern, we headed north on highway 93, also known as the Great Basin Highway. I estimated our arrival at the Little Ale'Inn at around 6 p.m. We actually arrived at around 5:45 p. m. While traveling on highway 93 we decided to snap pictures of some of the scenery to use up the slow speed film in my Chinon ZoomCam. Some of the higher mountains around the Parahnagat Valley were capped with white blankets of snow. Yellow flowers were Spring-blooming along the roadside. We were in a good mood. We stopped at Mailbox Road near mile marker 29 on highway 375 to snap additional pictures. The sur- rounding mountains had already hidden the sun for the day. A little further up the road just before mile mark- er 26 I noticed a large dirt pull-out. I was determined to return to this pull-out later in the evening. We arrived at the Little Ale'Inn and greeted Pat and Joe Travis. Pat recognized me instantly, and both of them were happy to see us since our last visit. Copies of my book, Cosmic Top Secret, were stacked on the shelf and offered for sale. I picked up a new book, \"Area 51\" Viewer's Guide, written by Glenn Campbell, an itinerant computer programmer who has settled in Rachel to study the strange stories of this region and map out the area. Later, we were intro- duced to Glenn, an affable young man. We were eager to swap information, but food was also a priority. We ordered dinner and talked. I also booked a room in a trailer for the night so we could take an early morning trip out to the viewing site and would not have to drive far to get some additional rest. We placed our suitcases in the trailer and left Rachel sometime after 7:45 that evening and headed east on 375.1 decided to travel no faster than 50 mph as this was open range and cows still wandered onto the road in the early evening. When we got to mile marker 17 up on Coyote Summit at about 8:13, we spotted a security vehicle, a large green Bronco, PAGE 14 NUMBER 304 AUGUST 1993"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL parked off the other side of the road facing Rachel. Its amber front lights were on. We continued slowly until we reached mile marker 26. Passing this, I started to look for the dirt pull-out on the right and when I spot- ted it, pulled off the highway about fifteen to twenty feet with my truck facing the skyglow of Las Vegas due south. I switched off the lights of my pickup truck and as soon as my eyes adjusted to the darkness that enveloped the Tikaboo Valley, I got out to look at the stars. Though it was partly cloudy, I could clearly make out the Big Dipper, Orion, Sirius, the Pleiades, and Arcturus. I could also see the craggy outlines of the Jumbled Hills and the Groom Mountains against the faint skyglow. It wasn't as cold as I expected and I only wore a pull-over sweater. As soon as I saw the lights of a vehicle coming down Coyote Summit, I got back in the truck. The first object I spotted in the sky was an aircraft with its positional lights and strobe blinking as it moved away from Groom Lake toward the southeast. Nothing exciting there. Pamela com- mented that the vehicle from the west was getting closer and she wanted to see if it was the security vehicle we had seen earlier at mile marker 17. We had first spotted its lights coming down from the summit at about 8:21. When the vehicle passed us at 8:30, we were cer- tain it was the same one we had seen on the summit. It was now heading east on 375. I was looking at my watch at 8:31 and asked Pamela how long she wanted to stay and skywatch since we wanted to return in the early morning hours to see \"Old Faithful.\" Glenn had told us that he thought that \"Old Faithful\" was just a 737 from Las Vegas's McCarran airport that ferried in workers to Groom at the same time each morning, but we wanted to come out and see for ourselves if that was the case or whether it was something else. We talked for about five minutes when we spotted a light about ten or fifteen degrees to the left of our heading. We both had 10x50 Bushnell binoculars. I looked at the light through my binoculars and saw a small, round white light above a small round amber light. At this time, I speculated that we might be look- ing at a security vehicle that was anywhere from 3 to 6 miles from our position, but I could not think of a road that was located where this light was emanating from. We talked for additional minutes. Pamela was relating this story about a healer who had come from Sedona, Arizona to find a man named \"Jim\" in Rachel. Jim was Pat Travis's grandson and he had been in an acci- dent. We talked for another five or six minutes when we spotted another ground light to our right. I looked at it through binoculars and it seemed to be on or near the Groom Road and casting a beam on the ground. We decided that I should keep an eye on the light on the right while Pamela kept an eye on the original light which now appeared to be below our line of sight When I looked back and raised my camera to snap a picture of this oncoming object, It had again trans- formed into two or three bright orbs and was quick- ly closing distance. I remember saying they were coming to get us. and was casting a fan-shaped glow into the air. We talked another three to five minutes when Pamela said, \"Something is happening. Look back at the first light.\" E vents started happening fast. The first light ap- peared to be an object the size of a bus with square light panels lifting off from the ground! The panels appeared to glow amber and blue-white. The object was tilting to the right. Then the lights rapidly resolved into two glowing orbs or discs of brilliant blue-white light that steadily increased in brilliance. These lights became so bright they hurt my eyes and were still getting more brilliant with time. I had to put down my binoculars, but Pamela kept hers trained on these baby suns as they started to move toward us. My heart started to palpitate and my adrenaline was rush- ing as this lighted object appeared to be on a collision course for my truck. These bright orbs were clearly flying over the desert. The lights did not bounce over the mounds of sand and sagebrush. I reached for my camera behind the seat and felt it snag, so I diverted my eyes to free it. Pamela said that at this point the orbs transformed again into a ring of multicolored lights that moved in a \"digital\" counter-clockwise rev- olution around what now appeared to be a disc. When I looked back and raised my camera to snap a picture of this oncoming object, it had again transformed into two or three bright orbs and was quickly closing dis- tance. I remember saying that they were coming to get us and Pamela asking why I was so scared. I had to snap a picture fast, so I snapped it before exiting the truck. The automatic flash went off with light bouncing against the windows, but I felt that the object's bright- ness could not fail to register on my Kodak Ektar 1000 film. Then confusion reigned. As I finished snapping the picture and exiting the truck at the same time as Pamela, I had not removed my eyes from the orbs which now appeared east of us as automobile head- lights traveling west on 375. That was clearly impos- sible! I had not seen these lights move from a south bearing to an east bearing and neither had Pamela. This car made a gentle whooshing sound as it passed by us, but made no motor sounds or tire sounds on the pavement. We watched its tail lights change in intensi- ty as it whisked away toward Coyote Summit. This was no ordinary car. Pamela saw gold-speckled paint and white-walls on an older, long American car. I AUGUST 1993 NUMBER 304 PAGE 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL glanced at my watch. It was 9:15. No way! It should have only been about 8:50 at the latest. What hap- pened? I was angry. I told Pamela that the vehicle we saw could not possibly be driving across the desert to our south, then appear abruptly as if coming from the east. And a ring of lights does not transform itself into a car in normal reality. We discussed this all the way back to the Little Ale'Inn. We went into the bar for a drink, talked with Pat for a few moments, then went to our trailer. I tried to get to sleep around 11:30 that night. At 1:46 the next morning I awoke with a yelp. I had dreamed that a dark human-like form was examining me and had hold of my left ankle. Pamela had already awakened, asking how long we would be gone. She sometimes talks in her sleep, but this time it also had awakened her. I wanted to go back to the site even though it was a little too early for \"Old Faithful.\" We eventually went back to mile marker 26, arriving by 3:30 the morning of March 17th (St. Patrick's Day). We slept for awhile, then my watch alarm awoke me at 4:30 to start looking at the southern sky for \"Old Faithful.\" At precisely 4:50, we spotted it. It was a glowing amber-gold light without strobes, rotating beacons or other conventional aircraft lighting. It was in view for about five minutes and seemed to descend on Groom Lake. It did not appear to be a 737 or other conventional aircraft, but it did not execute any extra- ordinary aerodynamic maneuvers. REGRESSION SESSIONS After more rest back at the trailer, we left Rachel around 12:30 in the afternoon and returned to Las Vegas to find a room. We checked in at a Super 8 Motel on Koval Lane, and after dinner I called John Lear. He seemed insistent that we come up to see him for awhile so we did. When we got there, we told him our story. He asked if he could regress me under hyp- nosis as he thought I looked a little stressed-out from the previous night's adventure. John was only attempting to hypnotize me for thirty minutes or so to help relax me and decided not to tape record the session. The session lasted one hour and thirty-five minutes and Pamela ended up taking twen- ty-four pages of notes. I recalled the period of disori- entation we had in the incident, and as it unfolded I saw the craft stop above us, brightly illuminating the ground, the truck, and us in its glare. Then I seemed to have ascended through the bottom of this craft and was met by a being walking out of the bright interior light. Actually, he had just stepped through a brilliant- ly lighted interior wall of the craft. This being was gray in color and about six feet tall. His eyes had what appeared to be black plastic shields slanting in insect fashion around his egg-shaped head. He had on a two-tone gray suit, with a lighter gray V Quaylar as drawn by Bill Hamilton. in the front, and a black belt with a black tube on his right side. There was a triangular symbol (actually giving the impression of a tetrahedron) enclosing a helical coil on the left breast of the suit. His long arms ended in four long fingers. His face was a mask of non-expression, yet he communicated with me in blunt, concise phrases. I was concerned about Pamela, but he showed me her frozen form on the ground. Off to her left side was a small gray creature as if posted on station. I was confused. She was the abductee, so why was he taking me inside this craft? He indicated it was my turn and I needed an adjustment and I would learn some things. He took one arm and escorted me gently inside a dome-like room that was evenly and brightly illumi- nated in all directions. In the center of this room was a tilting metal table which he placed me against. It tilted back about thirty degrees from the vertical. In front of me, projecting out from the curving wall, were what appeared to be a row of small computer screens. I knew that this table was a sophisticated sensor and was registering my thoughts, emotions and physiology which were displayed on these screens. This being identified himself as Quaylar. Quaylar had replaced my leg at the ankle back onto the tilt table's surface at one point. This process lasted about five minutes. The telepathic or mind-sharing process allowed me access to a great deal of information that wasn't simply com- municated. Quaylar returned me to the exit and I jump-floated to the ground about fifteen or twenty feet below. When I resynched, I saw the phantom car PAGE 16 NUMBER 304 AUGUST 1993"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Inside the van, two men dressed entirely In black with black baseball caps on their heads, subjected her to Intrusive procedures. She remembered seeing electronic Instruments Inside the van as well as automatic rifles. lights. Was this a signal to my subconscious that something odd intervened in the missing-time period? Another idea that impressed me strongly under hypnosis was that the missing-time or missing-memo- ry state was caused by a phase shift in time. The time frequency in the field of this object was not in synch with our normal earth time frequency, giving us a con- scious gap in memory. I did not wait to follow scientific procedures and have Pamela and I hypnotized separately on different occasions, though we did do this later. We tried to document all that we could. I took a daytime photo of the pull-out from the same truck angle as the night shot of the object to show the view from our angle of bearing and the desert scrub the object was traveling over. When I hypnotized Pamela Thursday night, March 18, more details emerged. Pamela remembered being frozen outside of the craft and the little Gray standing at her side. She also reports a painful buzzing in her left ear. Up to this point of separation, our description of events agrees completely except for the brief period of time when I went to snatch my camera from behind the seat. She then recalls a narrow, pencil-thin beam of blue-white light coming out of the bottom of the craft and striking her right eye just to the right of the pupil. And indeed, there is a spot on the right side of the iris at the 9 o'clock position where the beam struck. She also remembers seeing two men observing her from a van on the highway. She actually states that the little Gray walked her away from the direction of the van to the other side of the truck to hide her from view. She also recalls details about the phantom car that we saw after the gap in time. On Thursday, April 1, Pamela was regressed again by hypnotherapist Yvonne Smith. This time Pamela remembered being taken aboard the white van she saw on the highway. The van had an antenna on the roof. Inside the van, two men, dressed entirely in black with black baseball caps on their heads, subjected her to intrusive procedures. They administered some drops in her right eye and placed an odd instrument into her left ear canal. She remembered seeing electronic instruments inside the van as well as automatic rifles. She also recalls that these men admonished her not to speak about her experiences. She did not see the little Gray during this period, nor does she remember exact- ly how she was placed back in position by our truck. We had additional regression sessions with Leslie Freeman, a psychologist and hypnotherapist who works with our local MUFON group in Los Angeles. Details of what came out of these sessions are too numerous to recount here. I have had others report missing-time experiences in the Tikaboo Valley. My impression is that this has nothing to do with test flying discs from Area S-4. Something alien resides in this section of Nevada and has found an interest in visitors who come to watch the skies around Area 51.

Letters to Mufon UFO Journal COMPLICATION FACTOR Has the community of ufological researchers and ana- lysts finally become so factionalized that no effective progress is possible in the effort to clearly delineate the central issues in the field? Are more resources wasted on vocal and public recrimination and metalogically falla- cious argument than are devoted to objective research, measurement and scientific debate? The answers would both appear to be affirmative, in the view of this outside observer. Although the Journal does not presume to be the sole voice of the re- search community at large it would appear to be the most widely circulated. My expectation is that many who are not involved directly in ufological research but who do follow its published literature have gotten the same impression from articles, letters, and editorials printed in the Journal over the past several months. A survey of the contents of the Journal published between March of 1992 and March of 1993 (a period chosen simply because I had access to these issues) tends to sup- port the impression that researchers are foundering in a sea of contention and tangential issues. While con- structive disagreement, based upon rules of scientific de- bate, can be healthy, it seems that the field of ufology is especially stricken and adversely impacted by its nega- tive effects. Premise: People see extraordinary things which ap- pear to have external reality, and some aspects of these sightings defy simple explanation. It's difficult to argue over a statement like this. However, it, or something very like it, is probably the only inarguable statement one can make about the study of the UFO phenomenon. (If it were not for the fact that this premise is reinforced every day, around the world, by continued sightings, I and presumably many others would turn away from this field of inquiry.) Ufology 's loss of focus occurs when one attempts to proceed from this major premise.

Reality is typically defined from all that we have previ- ously learned through years of exploration and study, and we have done fairly well researching that which we can see and touch. But we are in our infancy in regard to comprehending all that we cannot see or touch. The entire field of UFO research is basically forced to deal with a mystery that is not normally in our grasp or within our ability to study under a microscope or in a laboratory setting. The bizarre data from reliable people regarding abductions by UFO entities pushes our notions of reality even further over the edge. The mere sugges- tion of people passing whole through walls, being lifted by light beams, and never seen by neighbors while oth- ers are placed in \"suspended animation\" is enough to cause anyone to want to turn and run back to nice, safe, secure, and predictable forms of reality such as late night reruns of \"I Love Lucy!\" It is human nature to avoid any unknown which could cause a threat or dis- ruption to our secure manner of thinking or living. We humans like to have matters under control and in order. Science has proceeded cautiously to gather knowl- edge in an orderly fashion so that we can put life into predictable patterns — and thus more under control. Challenges to these accepted \"norms\" can be scary; any change in thinking involves risks. Resistance to change is demonstrated in the psychological process of denial — the refusal to look at, study, or be willing to accept a po- tentially unsettling alteration to one's existence. The tendency then is to minimize, discredit, dismiss, or ig- nore such challenges to our comfortable way of orga- nizing our world. There is a clear difference between denial and skep- ticism. I welcome the challenging ideas that some skep- tics thoughtfully offer because they force me to reex- amine more closely my own research. This is healthy and productive in order to study all aspects and possi- bilities of this phenomenon. But there are others who call themselves \"skeptics\" whose minds have already de- cided what they need to believe. They are best known for their (1) criticism without productive feedback, (2) character assassinations, (3) broad and often vague gen- eralizations, (4) lack of first-hand investigation or ex- perience, and (5) offering of weak \"explanations\" that sound plausible to the public but rather amusing to se- rious researchers. This is not skepticism, this is blatant avoidance or denial. Science is supposed to study the un- known carefully — not be afraid to look at it or discuss it — even if it does have unsettling or monumental im- plications for mankind. Those who need to disbelieve have a right to do so for their own peace of mind. Perhaps the \"skeptics\" who are publicly quoted ought to be those who are actually involved on the front lines of abduction research. I would like to see those com- monly-quoted persons such as astronomer Carl Sagan or aviation writer Philip Klass actually sit through the pri- vate sessions and emotional processes of one hundred abductees before they publicly dismiss them as \"hallu- cinatory\" or \"attention-seeking\". When did either Sagan or Klass obtain psychology degrees in order to have the right to explain to the public the psychological sources of abduction accounts? Do I therefore have a similar right to express my uninformed opinions about the nature of comets for publication in the New York Times? I n the June 27th edition of the USA Today Weekend Magazine, the cover story on UFO abductions man- aged to quote Robert Baker, a University of Kentucky professor emeritus, saying that \"it's very easy for two people to have the same kind of hallucinatory experience at the same time, then reinforce each other.\" This is an incredible statement when I review my own fourteen years of direct clinical practice with thousands of hos- pitalized psychiatric patients. Hallucinations are a private and internally-generated set of distortions representative of the individual's dynamics and personal issues. They are not easily shared. There is a rare delusional disorder (called Folie a Deux) in which two persons in a symbi- otic relationship may develop similar delusional be- liefs. This is hardly the case with Skye Ambrose (central figure of this same feature article) and her casual ac- quaintance, \"Jennifer,\" who were happily returning from a professional conference in beautiful Aspen, Colorado. They did not have any need for a disruptive experi- ence. They were amazed at what they witnessed and de- scribed to each other objectively. They both claimed they never removed their seat belts or ever got out of the car. They were irritable after their two hours of \"missing time\" and did not want to talk about it with each other. Robert Baker's public remarks make no clinical sense overall or in the examination of the case outlined in the article. It is my understanding that Robert Baker has not worked with any \"abductees\" firsthand. In fact he is an academic or classroom psychology professor rather than a clinical or direct practice psychologist. This distinction is important because the general public just hears the word \"psychologist,\" You would not let your gynecolo- gist perform open-heart surgery for your cardiac surgeon just because they are both medical doctors, would you? In general the media is not as careful as to whom they will quote in order to balance an article's viewpoints. We PAGE 18 NUMBER 304 AUGUST 1993"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Isn't It interesting how many different cultures speak of some kind of small and mysterious entity which magically Intrudes into the lives of humans? must look carefully at the experience and credentials of those being quoted before assuming they truly speak in an informed manner for the actual research being done. Let the abduction researchers speak for the research. Armchair theorists and other outsiders can propose the- ories, hypotheses, and research ideas but should not be stating conclusions publicly, having not performed any research! (Of course they will, and the media will still quote them as well.) \"Skeptics\" like Baker and Sagan often point to folk- lore as an explanation for modern abduction scenarios. Baker says, \"Abduction delusions abound in folklore. Since the Middle Ages, people have been abducted by dragons, ogres, leprechauns, and faeries. They're not crazy; they're the victims of 'waking dreams' (falling asleep or coining awake in altered states of mind)...\" In the same case example of Skye Ambrose and \"Jennifer\" neither one had any need for a faerie, leprechaun, or alien to disturb their trip home from the conference in Aspen. They were not falling asleep; their hearts were pounding and adrenalin flowing as they watched the ball of light and light beams come near their car. Neither one made any claims of being abducted by anything that night. And could they have actually shared the same hypnogogic (falling asleep) delusions when neither was falling asleep or reporting any such imagery? C arl Sagan feels he also is scoring points with the folklore notion in his March 7. 1993 Parade Magazine article, \"Are They Coming For Us?\" He sug- gests that the following account from 1645 strength- ens the folklore explanation. \"A Cornish teenager, Anne Jeffries, was found groggy and crumpled on the floor. Much later she recalled being attacked by little men, car- ried paralyzed to a castle in the air, seduced and re- turned home. She called the little men faeries. The next year she was arrested for witchcraft.\" It would have been unlikely that she would have used the term \"alien\" or thought about \"space visitors\" in 1645. In the cultural context of her time in history these words may have been her best effort to describe her experience. There is enough evidence to indicate that there is some kind of a reality to the abduction phenomenon. There is a strong suggestion that it has been around to some degree at least since Biblical times. It would make more sense that this inconceivable, misinterpreted, and confusing type of UFO experience would have been viewed and described in a wide variety of ways over time. It would have stim- ulated many legendary tales and magical stories across the world as people would try to comprehend their un- usual experiences and attempt to ascribe some kind of meaning which could provide some form of explanation more acceptable to the general public. Original tales of faeries and leprechauns told of naughty little entities that abducted children and adults for hours. Over time the public image of a leprechaun has been embellished with more loveable clothes, a pipe, and an impish, more likeable manner of behavior. Isn't it interesting how many different cultures speak of some kind of small and mysterious entity which in- trudes magically into the lives of humans? Did folklore develop similar themes and imagery by coincidence, or was there a set of unexplained human experiences providing the foundation for the tales over time? What stimulates the creation of particular myths and legends brings my thoughts to the charming tale of Peter Pan. Here we have a small, thin, boyish figure — who never grows larger or older — floating in the bed- room window of the children's nursery night after night. He is accompanied by a small bouncing ball of light af- fectionately named Tinkerbell. He gains their trust, has them think \"happy thoughts,\" and entices them to float out the window with him to go visit a wondrous place. There, in Never-Never Land, adolescent Wendy is in- troduced as a \"mother\" to a group of odd-looking chil- dren who have never known what it is like to feel a mother's emotions. Upon their return home, Wendy's fa- ther catches a glimpse of the golden ship as it disappears in the sky and is stunned. He makes the intriguing re- mark, \"You know, I have the strangest feeling that I've seen that ship before, a long time ago ... somewhere in my youth.\" (Next: \"Explanations, Part Two: Connections with Sexual Trauma, False Memories, etc.\") Mr. Carpenter Is MUFON's Director of Abduction Research.

The Fund for UFO Research received and eventually approved a pro- posal by Karl Pflock, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense and currently a full-time researcher/writer, to conduct further research into the case. The grant will support general investigation costs and a field investi- gation trip to New Mexico to interview additional wit- nesses and to obtain documentary evidence. During this period, the Fund also approved a proposal to support the research expenses of Leonard Stringfield into reported UFO crash/retrieval cases. The amount of support will be up to $1,200 in 1993. On February 6, the Fund sponsored the first of what may be a series of conferences on the UFO abduction phenomenon. Fifty-five persons attended the invitation- only suburban Washington, DC, conference, including abduction researcher Budd Hopkins and 20 \"experi- encers\" — a dozen of whom participated in a lengthy panel discussion on the phenomenon. The conference was coordinated by board member Richard Hall, who has been conducting a local abduction investigation ef- fort. (Hall's report on the five-year investigation. Testing Reality. A Research Guide for the UFO Abduction Experience, is now available from the Fund. Write for details.) Also during this period, the Executive Committee approved a proposal submitted by John Kasher, Ph.D., professsor of physics and astronomy at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, to analyze a videotape shot on board the space shuttle Discovery in October 1991, which he believes shows truly anomalous objects instead of ice particles (as maintained by NASA). Dr. Kasher proposes to use two graduate students and a $17,000 work station to conduct the analysis. The committee agreed that the proposal was a worthwhile project and voted unanimously in favor of providing Dr. Kasher with up to $400. A panel consisting of board members Don Berliner (an aviation and science writer), Richard Hall (abstrac- tor/editor), and Fred Whiting (former broadcast jour- nalist) selected winners of the 1992 Donald Keyhoe Journalism Award competition, which is sponsored by the Fund. The winners were: • First Place: Christopher Evans of the Cleveland Plain Dealer for his article describing a U.S. Coast Guard investigation into the March 4, 1988, landing of an unidentified flying object on a frozen Lake Erie, near Fairport, OH. Evans received a $500 cash prize. • Second Place: Annette Gillespie, staff writer of the Bradenton, FL, Herald, who wrote about the UFO abduction phenomenon, with four articles featuring lo- cal abduction witnesses who described their experi- ences. Gillespie received a $250 award for her entry. • Third Place: Dawn Shurmaitis, a reporter for The Times Leader of Wilkes-Barre, PA, for a detailed ex- amination of UFO activity and interest in the subject throughout the state. Shurmaitis received a $100 prize. • Honorable Mention: Robin Hart, Living Section Editor of the Foothill Leader in Glendale, C A, for an ar- ticle about a UFO \"abductees\" support group; and Laura Lee Janssen, reporter for the Williamsport, PA Sun- Gazette, for an article on a local UFO sighting report.

LETTERS - Continued from Page 17 For instance: This premise does not lead logically to the conclusion that (a) sightings are caused by machines operated by extraterrestrials, nor does it even infer that (b) human beings are being physically (or psychically) abducted against their will for whatever nefarious pur- poses. What tortuous inferential trail takes us from see- ing strange objects to being, as Charles Fort postulated, someone's property? It's as if the ufologists were delib- erately attempting to complicate the issue. The literature is replete with heated debate over precisely how many angels (aliens?) can dance on the head of a pin, when the simple fact of the existence of angels has not been for- mally established. This \"Complication Factor\" has a frustrating effect on anyone who attempts to understand the current state of ufological inquiry and results. I would challenge the editors and contributors to the Journal to consider the following actions: 1. Analyze the sightings database(s) and publish a re- port on the number, and detailed characteristics, of sightings which were later found to have conventional causes. 2. Publicly regard the verity of data obtained via hypnosis as suspect. 3. Refuse to publish articles and letters consisting solely of ad hominem argument. Why these questions? Because acting on them would address a criticism that objective students of the subject have (or should have), and it is the fact that science advances not only by successive stages of proof, but also by stages of disproof. Regarding item 1, if there are half a million sightings in the databases, and all but one can be proved to have a conventional cause, then re- searchers are finally getting close to some definitive answers. This is a key concept: If only one case survives analysis, then that is the case to which you should assign all your resources in the struggle to understand why it survived the hypothesis-test process! Item 2 is important because many fee! that this investigative method is not only capable of giving flawed results, but that uncon- trolled use will eventually cost many witnesses and re- searchers their credibility. With respect to item 3: Only logical forms of debate should be allowed in a journal of ostensibly scientific inquiry. When one point of view is so strong and well presented, and its supporting data are unassailable, it all too frequently causes the weaker side to mount an attack on the person representing the stronger point of argument. Such debate proves nothing and advances our understanding not a whit. In conclusion let me say that the Journal is clearly ful- filling its mission to provide a forum for the creation and exchange of ideas: my observations are provided in that spirit of intellectual exchange. —Jeff Rawlings Yellville, AR AUGUST 1993 NUMBER 304 PAGE 23"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL DIBLEGXQR:S,MESSAGE Walter Andrus 0 ° ° NEWS FROM AROUND THE NETWORK MUFON ANNUAL AWARD Each year MUFON honors a person in Ufology who their colleagues select for having made the most out- standing contribution to the advancement of the UFO phenomenon during the past five years.

MUFON 1993 SYMPOSIUM The 24th Annual MUFON International UFO Symposium in Richmond, Virginia, exceeded all previ- ous attendance records. For those of you who were un- able to attend, the MUFON 1993 International UFO Symposium Proceedings (304 pages) are available from MUFON in Seguin, Texas, for $20 plus $1.50 for postage and handling. The proceedings include the pa- pers of all speakers except Jorge Martin, whose exten- sive paper arrived too late to be published prior to the symposium. Due to the exorbitant cost proposal by an independent contractor to videotape the symposium speakers, the contract was cancelled just prior to the meeting for ob- vious financial considerations with no possibility of se- curing a more reasonable bid for the services from an- other contractor. Sales of videotapes of past sympo- siums have been done at a financial loss, therefore it was a management decision to decline the bid of the con- tractor who obviously wanted to take advantage of an opportunity. Various attendees made audio tapes at their own discretion. NEW OFFICERS Victor Lourenco (Mississauga, ON), Provincial Director for Ontario, Canada, has promoted Tom Theofanous (Toronto.
