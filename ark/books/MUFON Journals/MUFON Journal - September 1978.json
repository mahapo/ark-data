FROM THE EDITOR UFO discussions at the United Nations appear to have fizzled out largely due to U.S. opposition to tackling the UFO problem. A report is forthcoming from Peter Tomakawa who attended the sessions. Any leadership that the U.S. may have had in the past now appears to be on the wane, but other developments suggest that international interest may be increasing. The French government report summarized in this issue gives hope that a major nation may support new initiatives. There is also an unconfirmed report that the British House of Lords will have a debate on UFOs on January 118,1979. The recent landings in kuwait have stirred up interest in the Arab world, and we expect to have a first-hand report from a scientist on the scene. On the home front, the CIA has now released close to a thousand pages of documents, but is withholding more recent information suggesting a continuing involvement on their part in studying UFOs well into the 1970's. New developments on the CAUS-GSW lawsuit will be reported as soon as available. In this issue UFOs FROM UNDERWATER BASES OFF ARGENTINA?  3 By Joseph M.

By Joseph M. Brill (My most sincere thanks are extended to Dr. Willard Armstrong of St. Louis, Mo., for his translation from Spanish of the details of the cases presented in this article. Likewise, I would like to extend my gratitude to the Argentine research group E.D.O.V.N.I, of Rosario, for their cooperation in providing the needed cases to document the idea presented in the title of this article.) For some time, parallel with the presence of UFOs, particular interest has been given to multiple aquatic manifestations which appear to be associated with the UFO phenomenon. This singular aspect — as of yet not greatly examined — merits broader consideration, especially since the proof of its reality would require the complete modification of many hypotheses that seek to explain the problem, specifically those referring to temperature inversions, conventional bodies such as airplanes and balloons, and meteorites in general. If, in reality, the UFO phenomenon reveals itself also in the water, entering into the sea and emerging therefrom, the possibility of accepting those theories is discarded completely. The true investigation cannot resort to any type of euphemism in order to avoid a more thorough study of this strange and phenomenal implication. The Spanish UFO researcher, Antonio Ribera — possibly influenced by Charles Fort — was the first UFOlogist who brought together the majority of earlier studies on the marine implications of UFOs, suggesting that — given that they are intelligent or intelligently controlled phenomena — it would not be unlikely that they make use of the ocean depths as operational bases. In his first book, \"Unknown Objects in the Sky\" (1961), Ribera presented this hypothesis, dedicating to the subject six pages and touching on it in the final part of a chapter \"which treated other topics. In the second edition, '\"The Great Flying Saucer Mystery\" (1966), he then dedicated all 18 pages of chapter eleven to it, which he titled \"Submarine Bases?\" Other investigators have recently collected his suggestions, bringing together other important, earlier works on the problem to such a point that it all leaves pne to\" speculate that the relationship between UFOs and the ocean currently offers strong indications of having a real basis. Because of this, the marine facet should be included \"in the content of the definitions of UFOlogy and of UFO. The Condon Report did not analyze any case referring to this aspect of the phenomenon nor did it allude in any way to the periodic occurrence of these manifestations. The lack of consideration of the problem perhaps, may have been motivated by the circumstance that the great majority of existing cases did not have their genesis in the United States coastal regions, but, rather in the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, and the Indian and Atlantic Oceans (particularly along the coast of Argentine Patagonia). In any case, the advantage of a clarifying pronounce- ment is clear. Marine Bioluminescence In order to appropriately indicate. the scope of the phenomenon, it is obviously important to describe the characteristics of marine biolum- inescence, the production of light on the part of living plants and animals. Thousands of these floating organisms can be combined in the sea so as to produce the well-known effect of \"phosphorescence,\" a term which entails, an appreciable number of different, luminous manifestations that vary according to the species of organisms involved, their concen- tration in the sea, and the environmental factors that stimulate them to produce luminescence. One of the most curious forms is the so-called \"phosphorescent wheel,\" charac- terized by a circular configuration with brilliant rays which are emitted from a luminous nucleus. They are animated by rotational and translational motions that give them an unusual aspect. As yet, its true origin is not known for certain. For some individuals, a combination of bioluminescence, common waves, and optical illusion is involved, but this is not a satisfactory interpretation. The most accepted theory speaks of an interference generated by the interaction of two or more series of expanding, concentric waves, derived from seismic phenomena and which would be made visible by the stimulation of luminescent plants at the points in which the concentric circles of the two waves come into contact with each other. This would originate the radial effect typical of these wheels. According to the late author, Richard Turner, this explanation is sufficient to appropriately explain the marine observations of luminous \"discs\" or \"wheels,\" which move along the surface of the water (or below the surface, we could speculate). One could accept Turner's theory to'the extent that, many famous incidents, such as those of the ships \"Bulldog,\" \"Vulture;\" and \"Patna,\" correspond completely to the characteristics of such \"wheels\" but, his theory must be rejected when extended to the totality of marine observations. , In 1967, when Richard Turner wrote his notable article for a British publication .(Flying Saucer Review, Sept.-Oct. 1967) he ignored numerous (continued on next page) 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"(Argentina, continued) events, among them, several from South America, which reduced considerably the scope of application of his theories. Proof of this is that in the list of incidents which he provided none of the Atlantic observations of recent years were included, when it was these — among others — which would refute his own theories. Some of those events are included in this article and they prove — to my understanding — that the UFO phenomenon seems to be curiously linked to aquatic media. From its study, I can draw no other, more valid conclusion. Atlantic Manifestations The oldest Argentine case is that concerning Sr. Romeo Ernesto Suarez which occurred in June 1950. This individual was employed as a driver in the fire department at Ushiiaia, Capital of Tierra del Fuego, when he decided to undertake a long journey, on foot from this city to Buenos Aires, which he succeeded in completing in 5 months and 14 days, after travelling practically 4,000 kilometers. The majority of Argentine newspapers carried accounts of this journey, including the various troubles and problems which he had to overcome but, what he did not relate at' that time, through fear of ridicule, he revealed in 1968 due to growing interest shown by offical Argentine groups in the consideration of the UFO phenomenon. According to Suarez, 4 or 5 days after his departure from Ushuaia, he was between San Sebastian and Rio Grande (still within the territory of Tierra del Fuego) and was walking through a coastal region about 600 meters from the Atlantic Ocean. It was approximately 11:00 PM. Suddenly and breaking the nocturnal silence, he heard something similar to a loud noise of water violently disturbed. Several sheep, who were sleeping in a field, jumped up alarmed and hurriedly ran away. There was no wind, storm, or thunderstorm that might have explained the event. Immediately a luminous object of oval form appeared emerging from the sea about 500 meters from the shore. It rose up vertically to a certain altitude and then made a turn of ninety degrees and disappeared towards the northeast in 4 the direction of Argentine terrority. Some 15 days later, also at night and when he was between Rio Gallegos and the city of Santa Cruz (in the neighborhood of Puerto Coyle, in the province of Santa Cruz) a similar phenomenon occurred. This time, although he could not determine the exact distance from the coast, four small luminous objects came up out of the waters of the Atlantic. They repeated the same maneuver as the previous object; that is, they gained altitude vertically arid then in perfect formation approached the coastline and moved off towards the west, in the direction of the Andes Mountains. These observations of veritable luminous fleets seem to constitute a quite frequent event in the Patagonian region of 'Argentina (approximately from the 40th parallel on to the south). In August 1962, for example, Sr. Vincente A. Bordoli, a truck driver based in Mar del Plata .(province of Buenos Aires), reported 'to the police that in the south along National Route 3, which follows the Atlantic coast of Argentina, he together with his son Hugo had observed a strange, brilliant formation which —.periodically — entered the Gulf of San Matias (province of Rio Negro) and afterward emerged climbing up into the sky and disappeared. The Phenomenon In The Gulf of San Jorge A bit more disconcerting was an episode of singular charateristics which occurred on July 28,1964, in the Gulf of San Jorge (between the provinces of Chubut and Santa Criz), At 9:24 PM the Subprefecture of Puerto Madryn received a radio-telegraph message from the tanker-ship of Argentine flag \"Cazador\". The captain reported the following: \"At 9:10 PM a signal flare light was sighted. It began to circle around the area, while voices around the ship were heard. We are at 45 degrees 56 minutes 6 seconds south latitude and 64 degrees 0 minutes 0 seconds west longitude. The voices are not localized. My ship does ^not have radar\". Shortly afterward, the tanker-ship \"Cazador\" again confirmed its position and communicated that it was searching for the presumed shipwrecked sailors in a 5-mile circle, being assisted in their mission by another tanker-ship, the \"San Antonio\". In the afternoon of the following day the Norwegian ship \"Sumber\" arrived at the port, whose captain sent to the Subprefecture a report as follows: \"Yesterday — at approxi- mately 9:00 PM — while we were sailing toward your port, we observed the fall of what appeared to be a meteorite or small comet. It was travelling in a northeasterly direction, HORIZONTALLY toward the earth. It was emitting a luminosity which — at times — became intense.\" The position of the ship was close to that of the \"Cazador\" so that one could assume that from the \"Sumber\" the presumed signal flare was sighted as was indicated by the former ship (the signal flare lights describe a parabola and their trajectory is never horizontal). Several small boats from the Subprefecture and other boats conducted an extensive search in order to determine the position of the fishing boats which operate in that zone since it was feared that one of them had been shipwrecked, but the search did not uncover any sign of such a mishap. Two months later this same Gulf of San Jorge was the scene of yet another phenomenon of similar outline. An individual known and respected for his honesty, who requested that his name not be revealed, reported that on September 30, 1964, while he was driving at night to the city of Comodora Rivadavia coming from Caleta Oliva, he saw appear at the edge of the city some strange objects (3 or 4) that described .parabolas and descended one after another into the sea. The unusual spectacle caused the witness to stop his vehicle sp as to carefully observe the flames which the objects were leaving as they passed. After resuming his journey and having travelled some distance from the initial point of observation, he noticed other luminous objects — or perhaps the same objects — emerge from the surface of the water and then circle around at a dizzy speed, and within an outline of shining light again climb up and finally disappear into the sky."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"More Recent Cases One of the most recent cases of UFO observations with marine implications occurred July 11,1968. On that day, Sr. Raul L. Benitez and his son Ricardo were driving at 15 minutes past midnight, after having stopped to eat supper at a downtown restaurant in Mar del Plata. As they were driving along on Maritimo Boulevard on arriving at Duro Avenue, Ricardo — who was looking at the ocean — noticed a luminosity approaching at a high rate of speed from the sky. He pointed it out to his father, who stopped the auto in order to observe the phenomenon in greater detail but, since it was hidden by the pier and the Altamar pastry shop, they returned to their vehicle and drove back toward Belgrano street, where they again observed it. It remained stationary, emitting a brilliant luminosity. At that point they observed a second luminous object approach from the south arriving rapidly at the place where the first object was located. There it remained stationary for a few minutes. Then, together, both objects began an extremely rapid flight away to the north and were lost from sight. The Benitez men left immediately toward La Perla (a little farther to the north) then stopped 100 meters beyond the monument to Alfonsina Storni, where the two. lights were observed making strange evolutions. They stopped, then moved on, retracing the route from the north and then approached the coast. There, they could clearly see that the lights had a disc shape with a diameter comparable to a full moon. These objects appeared to be rotating around an axis while emitting reddish and blue- violet light. Their speeds were at times greater than that of a jet airplane. One of the objects descended and submerged into the sea, while the other object remained in the air at a low altitude, after which it suddenly disappeared as if it had extinguished its lights. Less than one hour after that incident, at 1:05 AM, another UFO was observed by Captain Jorge Alberto Boveda, radio operator Manuel Jorge Fontini and helmsman Manuel Silva, of the Argentine ship \"Rio Grande\" which was anchored in the outer bay at Puerto Quequen (Necochea), about 120 kilometers to the south of the point of observation by the Benitez men. Also, four neighbors driving along Costanera Avenue sighted the phenomenon. First seen opposite the bathing beach approximately 800 meters on a straight line from the municipal promenade, the object moved off 750 meters to the starboard side and stopped at 100 meters altitude. Its shape was oval and it was extremely luminous. From its underside, it gave off a strong cone- shaped beam of light of green and viojet color, which illuminated the sea in a diameter of about 40 meters. Then, this light cone was retracted back to the object and it moved off at terrific speed. The entire incident took place within a matter of a couple of minutes. Although there was no submersion of this phenomenon, several of its characteristics presumably were related with the sighting of the Benitez men. Among them should be noted the short distance between Mar\" del Plata and Necochea (120 kilometers), the short distance in time between the two observations (less than one hour), as well as the curious projection of a luminous beam of light toward the sea \"as though searching for something,\" according to the statement of Captain Boveda. Another incident recorded in Argentina regarding this aspect of the UFO problem occurred on May 31, 1971, and had for its principal witness the psychologist Zulema Bruno,, who stated to the press that on that day while driving along the Pinamar coast (Buenos Aires province), he observed coming out of the Atlantic Ocean a strange object with the form of a flattened top that was rotating around a axis and emitting orange-colored rays of light. It accompanied his auto for about 300 meters and then at a dizzy speed made a turn and climbed up quickly until it was lost from sight. ' There are other similar cases many of which have occurred off the coast near and around Bahia Blarica throughout recent years. Some serious UFO organizations in Argentina have stated the possibility of underwater UFO bases off the coast of their country. Although this is not the only coastal region that has experienced , these sort of manifestations around the world, it is important to bear in mind that this region has been an area of continuing observations of this sort throughout the years. ; Conclusions   ^ These events consitute real evidence for a little-known aquatic aspect of the UFO phenomenon. The scientific theories that attempt to interpret the UFO phenomenon in normal terms suffer a rude reversal when confronted with such significant events, many of which have by chance involved experienced men of the sea. The speculation of Richard Turner, attempting to explain these manifestations in terms of \"phosphorescent wheels\" produced by bibluminescence, are inapplicable in the totality of the cases presented here. It would be ridiculous to presume that those \"wheels\" might arise from the ocean surface and be lost in space. Only a certain degree of optical illusion wpuld be acceptable, characterized by an aerial displacement of a few centimeters above the surface of the water, but never.ascents that could be measured in meters. The question of whether there are underwater bases off the Argentine coast remains a very strong possibility and one which I believe should be examined and researched in much greater depth. I would hope that serious UFOlogists would undertake such a project to determine if in fact such ideas as underwater bases for UFOs are. a fact and not just a theory.

This report of the .French governmental UFO study group GEPAN 1 documents the studies carried out by the group during the first part of 1978. Three special groups (rapid intervention, physical traces, radar alert) were created as part of the study group's functions, but they were tittle used during 1978. Instead, the bulk of work was devoted to 11 cases of high credibility and high strangeness. Eleven such cases were studied in great detail; only one proved to have a conventional explanation. In the other 10, it appeared that the distance between the witnesses and the objects was less than 250 meters. Of the five volumes of the report, three were entirely devoted to analysis of these 11 cases, all except one of which was pre-1978. The earliest was 1966. Two of the cases were humanoid sightings. The analysis and investigation was carried out by a four-person team in each case; the team included a psychologist, who separately carried out a psychological examination relevant to the evaluation of the testimony of the witnesses. The care with which distances, angles, and psychological factors were evaluated makes the bulk of the Condon Report seem very poor by comparison. In many cases, the investigations were textbook models of how such investigations should be carried out. In 10 of the 11 cases, the conclusion was that the witnesses had witnessed a material phenomenon that could not be explained as a natural phenomenon or a human device. One of the conclusions of the total report is that behind the overall phenomenon there is a \"flying machine. . . whose modes of sustenance and propulsion are beyond our knowledge.\" GEPAN was created in 1977, under the direction of Dr. Claude Poher. Poher has now resigned, feeling that he has done everything he could do with the methods at hand. Nonetheless, the organization has not been disbanded but. continues its work. During 1977, it was largely concerned with checking Poher's statistics, which it approved. 2 During 1978, it has expanded, its operation into the investigation of actual cases. It is alerted to actual cases by teletype by the Gendarmerie, the French national police force. The above report has reportedly been approved by GEPAN's supervisory scientific counsel. Note: the original report was limited to 120 or 140 copies and was secret. It is not available for general dissemination, and in any case is in French. There is extensive coverage in the report of the Teheran case, but nothing beyond what is known to American researchers; it was not one of the eleven cases studied, all of which were in France.

UFO \"Gives Rally Car a Lift.\" Bahia Blanca.-Two Chilean stragglers in the international \"Round South America\" motor rally claim they had an encounter with an unidentified flying object (UFO) on their way here. Carlos Acevedo, who was accompanied by Angel Moya, said that some 30 kilometers from Viedma he saw in his rear mirror a bright light he at first thought was from a lorry, but he judged it was travelling at about 300 kilometers an hour. The light completely enveloped his car, whose lights went out and motor stopped. Acevedo said the vehicle was then lifted off the ground. Both he and his companion were unable to make any movements while in this bubble of light. The car went through the air for about 15 kilometers after which it was deposited gently by the side of the road. On examining the tank of their car, Acevedo found it almost empty although it had nearly 400 liters of petrol when it met the UFO. The two drivers insisted on having a policeman as passenger the rest of the way to Bahia Blanca (NA).

Maccabee (Copyright Bruce S. Maccabee, 1978) • Recapitulation. About two weeks after Kenneth Arnold's sighting on June 24,1947 (a day that will live in infamy?), a top man in the Army Air Force Intelligence, General G. F. Schulgen, contacted the FBI and requested that the FBI interview many of the first people who reported flying discs to determine whether or not any of the reports could have been results of attempts at subversion. Gen. Schulgen said the AF was doing all it could to discover the cause of flying discs and didn't want to leave any possibilities unexplored. J. Edgar Hoover agreed to investigate under certain restrictions, so from August 1 to October 1, 1947, the agents were authorized to investigate flying disc reports. During this period of time the AF concluded that UFOs were real objects, as indicated by papers found in the FBI file and by a letter written by Gen. N.F. Twining, and the FBI concluded that UFO reports were not connected in any way with subversion, although some reports were hoaxes or pranks. The FBI ended its formal investigation in October 1947 for reasons which have been described in earlier installments of this series. After October 1947 the agents were supposed to avoid UFO investigations and to pass any information that they might receive to the nearest Air Force Office of Special Investigation (AFOSI) office. The FBI received little information on UFOs during 1948, but in 1949 the interest in flying objects increased sharply with the onset of \"green fireball\" incidents in the southwestern U.S.A. Also early in 1949 a \"confidential source\" told the FBI that the AF thought UFOs were manmade objects, perhaps utilizing nuclear propulsion. In February 1949 the FBI received a prototype sighting form entitled \"Air Intelligence Requirements Memoran- dum Number 4\" which was specifically directed toward obtaining information on flying discs for the AF. In March 1949 the FBI issued a restatement of its policy toward UFOs with the added suggestion that if anyone should volunteer information, the FBI agent involved should try to obtain the information requested by the AF in \"Memorandum Number 4\". During 1949 the FBI received (and passed on to the AF) some UFO cases: The FBI also obtained some information about the green fireball investigation that was carried on under the name Project Grudge. The FBI-UFO Connection in 1950. If the 1948-49 time period was the \"dark ages\" for FBI involvement with UFOs, then 1950 was a year of \"renaissance\". The year started with a \"bang\" in January when the Navy sent the FBI a report of several sightings including a radar-visual from Alaska, and continued with \"green fireball\" (and \"disklike variation\") sightings, ending with a small concentration over Oak Ridge, Tennessee, in December. Also during 1950 Hoover asked the Air Force what it thought flying saucers were and got the standard non-answer (i.e., most of the reports can be explained and the Air Force is not investigating). Somewhat later in 1950 the FBI received another request for Flying Disk information from the Air Force. All of this information for 1950 and 1951 will be presented in this and the following installments of this series. I will begin with the Alaska sightings, which I will describe completely since they have never before been published (to my knowledge) and since they are not in the Blue Book file. On April 24,1950, the FBI received from the ONI (Office of Naval Investigation - now the Naval Investigative Service) a copy of a report on flying discs. The FBI was not alone in receiving copies — the CIA got 8 copies, the State department received 5, and the Air Force Director of Intelligence got 5. There are a few scrawled initials on the FBI copy which suggest that someone might have read it, but the report probably did not make much of an impact on the FBI, even though it was at least one of the most credible, if not the most credible report which the FBI had received up to that time. The report outlined three sightings of unidentified objects by enlisted and commissioned Navy personnel in the vicinity of Kodiak, Alaska. . The sightings took place during the mornings of 22 and 23 January, 1950. The report referred to enclosures which contained verbatim accounts, airplane track data, and weather and balloon data. Apparently the enclosures were not sent to the FBI. Since the copy I received from the FBI was partially illegible, and since I did not receive copies of the enclosures, I attempted to locate an original copy by appealing directly to the Navy. After a \"paper chase\" lasting about 3 months I obtained a completely legible copy of the report, less the enclosures, but including the comments of official Navy investigators who tried to explain the sightings! I have been informed that the enclosures, if they exist, are probably in the uncatalogued records of a no- longer-existing research group known as \"Op322F2\". However, even without the enclosures the summaries within the report are sufficiently detailed to indicate that something unusual was in the Alaska skies in February 1950. 64    ' CONFIDENTIAL INTELLI- GENCE REPORT ISSUED BY THE INTELLIGENCE DIV- ISION OFFICE OF CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS NAVY DEPARTMENT DATE OF REPORT: 10 Feb. 1950 (continued on next page) 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"(FBI, Continued) 'PLACE: Kodiak, Alaska SOURCE: Official U.S. Navy SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENON IN VICINITY OF KODIAK, ALASKA EVALUATION: A-2 BRIEF: A report of sighting of unidentified airborne objects, by various nala personnel, on 22 and 23 January 1950, in the vicinity of Kodiak, Alaska, is contained herein. ENCLOSURES: (these were not obtained with the copies I received — BSM) 1. Enclosures (1), (2), and (4) are completed forms suggested by Commander in Chief, Alaskan Command, Fort Richardson, Alaska for the reporting of sighting of unidentified objects. (These enclosures were filled out by Smith, Morgan, Carver, and Barco.) Enclosure (3) is a sketch of radar interference experienced in aircraft piloted by Lt. Smith. Enclosure (5) is a track chart of aircraft in which Lt. Barco was embarked when he sighted unidentified object. Enclosure (6) contains statements by Morgan and Carver relative to their sighting. Enclosure (7) is a copy of Lt. Barco's statement and enclosure (8) is a summary of weather and balloon release information. 2.. A summary of the information contained in enclosure (1) through (8) follows: , a) At 220240W (Jan 22. at 2:40 A-M.) Lt. Smith, USN, patrol plane commander of P2V3 No. 4 of Patrol Squadron One reported an unidentified radar contact 20 miles north of the Naval Air Station, Kodiak, Alaska. When this contact was first made, Lt. Smith was flying the Kodiak Security Patrol. At 0248W (2:48 A.M.), 8 minutes later a radar contact was made on an object 10 miles southeast of NAS, Kodiak. Lt. Smith checked with the control tower to determine known traffic in the area, and was informed that there was none. During this period the radar operator, Gaskey, ALC, USN reported intermittent radar interference of a type he had never before experienced (See enclosure (3)). Contact was lost at this time, but intermittent interference continued. 8 2. b) At some time between 0200 and 0300W, Morgan, .BMC, USN, was standing watch on board the USS Tillamock (ATA 192), which was anchored in the vicinity of buoy 19 in the main ship channel. Morgan reported sighting a \"very fast moving red glow light, which appeared to be of exhaust nature, seemed to come from the southeast, moved clockwise in a large circle in the. direction of and around Kodiak and returned but in a generally southeast direction.\"Morgan called Carver, QM1, USN, also on watch, to observe this object, and they both witnessed the return flight. No odor or sound was detected, and the object was described to have the appearance of a ball of fire about one foot in diameter. 2. c) At 220440W (4:40 A.M.), conducting routine Kodiak security patrol, Lt. Smith reported a visual sighting of an unidentified airborne object at a radar range of 5 miles, on the starboard bow (i.e., simultaneous radar-visual observation!), This object showed indications of great speed on the radar scope. The trailing edge of the blip gave a tail like indication, (i.e., the blip was smeared because the object was moving noticeably during the time that the radar beam swept by it). At this time Lt. Smith called attention of all crew members to the object. An estimated ten seconds later, the object was directly overhead, indicating a speed of 1800 mph. Lt. Smith climbed to intercept and attempted to circle to keep the object in sight. He was unable to do this, as the object was too highly maneuverable. Subsequently the object, appeared to be opening the range, and Smith attempted to close the range. The object was observed to open out somewhat, then to turn to the left and come up on Smith's quarter. Smith considered this to be a highly threatening gesture, and turned out all the lights in the aircraft. (Perhaps Smith thought the object couldn't see in the dark and had no radar?) Four minutes later the object disappeared from view in a southeasterly direction. 2. d) At 230435W (Jan. 23 at 4:35 A.M.), the day following Lt. Smith's sighting, Lt. Causer and Lt. Barco of Patrol Squadron One .were conducting the Kodiak Security Patrol and sighted an unidentified object. At the time of the sighting the aircraft in which those officers were embarked was approximately 62 miles south of Kodiak. The object appeared to be on an ascending westerly course, and was in sight for ten minutes. During this period the object was observed by Lieutenants Causer and Barco, and Paulson, ADI, plane captain. At no time was radar contact made on the object. Lt. Causer was unable to close the object at 170 knots (about 196 mph; during 10 minutes the plane could travel about 32 statute miles). 2. e) The objects sighted have been described as follows: 1) To Lt. Smith and crew it appeared as two orange lights rotating about a common center, \"like two jet aircraft making slow rolls in tight formation\". It had a wide speed range. 2) To Morgan and Carver it appeared as a reddish orange ball of fire about one foot in diameter, travelling at a high rate of speed. 3) To Causer, Barco, and Paulson it appeared to be a pulsating orange yellow projectile shaped flame, with regular period of pulsation on 3 to 5 seconds, off 3 to 5 seconds. Later, as the object increased the range the pulsation appeared to increase to on 7 to 8 seconds and off 7 to 8 seconds. 3. A check with the Navy Weather Central, Kodiak, Alaska revealed that balloons were released at the following times: 22 January - 0445W and 2200 W, approximately (i.e., 4:45 A.M. and 10:00 P.M.) 23 January-0400 W, approximately 4. On 23 January winds aloft at 1000 feet were reported at 0400W as from 310° (i.e., from northwest) at 36 knots (41 mph), and at 2000 feet, from 240° (west-southwest) at 37 knots, while the object was reported to be on an ascending, westerly course (i.e., into the wind). •7'"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"' COMMENT: In view of the fact that no weather balloons were known to have been released within a reasonable time before the sightings, it appears that the object or objects were not balloons (bravo! — BSM). If not balloons the objects must be regarded as phenomena, possibly meteorites (sic), the exact nature of which could not be determined by this office. This concludes the report of the Alaska sightings as received from the FBI. Parenthetical statements and emphasis in the above sentences have been added by myself. From the Naval Historical Center I received the above summary and also the official Navy analysis. The analysis was carried out by two groups, apparently independently. Neither group had very enlightening things to say. The official opinion of OP322F2 was: \"Many of the previous reports of radar interference tend to indicate local interference (generated within the aircraft). This looks more like external interference from sources outside the aircraft than previous reports, though it is far from conclusive. These reports are always of interest.\" The official opinion of OP322V2C was: \"The possibi'/i'fy exists that incidents covered by para. 2. a,b, & d might be jet aircraft; however, there is insufficient intelligence to definitely identify the unidentified objects as aircraft. Several reports of similar radar interference have been received from DIO/17ND. It is possible that this is interference from another radar in the vicinity, malfunctioning of components within the radar set or both.\" (Note: DIO/17ND is'the intelligence unit of the 17th Naval District which included Alaska.) Notice that the explanations offered by F2 ignored the visual sightings completely. V2C tried to offer explanations for the visual and radar sightings for paragraphs 2. a,b, and d above. However, V2C \"choked\" when it came to 2.c. In the margin of the copy of the report which I received from the Naval Historical Center there are notations which give us some idea of the way V2C approached these reports. Next to paragraphs 2.a,b, & d are the notations \"A/C?\" which stand for \"Aircraft?\" However, next to paragraph 2.c there is simply the notation \"?\", which suggests that the radar-visual sighting that included a chase by the aircraft involved (Lt. Smith) completely stumped the \"experts\". Perhaps within the inner souls of the persons who viewed this report there was a glimmer of the truth — \"flying saucers exist.\" But who would dare make such a statement in an official document at a time when the Air Force had \"proven\" that flying saucer reports, or at least most of them, can be explained away? Perhaps OP322F2 had something besides Navy radar interference problems in mind when he (they) wrote at the end of the statement, \"These reports are always of interest.\" No Active Investigation. At least that's what the Air Force told Mr. Hoover according to a memorandum that was wirtten about a month before the Alaska report reached FBI headquarters. In the latter part of March 1950, Mr. Hoover decided to find out what the Air Force opinion on \"flying saucers\" was. The answer to his request is contained in a memorandum from Mr. Ladd to Mr. Hoover, dated March 28, 1950: 65 \"Reference is made to your inquiry on the attached routing slip: 'Just what are the facts re 'flying saucers'? A short memo as to whether or not it is true or just what Air Force, etc. think of them' In response to your inquiry, Special Agent obtained the following information today (3/28/50) from Major and Lieutenant Colonel of Air Force Intelligence. The Air Force discontinued their intelligence project to determine what flying saucers are the latter part of last year. They publically announced to the press in December 1949, that the project had been discontinued. They advised that the press release had been concurred in by the Army and Navy. The reason for the discontinuance, according to Major arid Lieutenant Colonel was that after two years of investigation over three- fourths of the incidents regarding flying saucers proved to be misidentifications of a wide variety of conventional items such as- lighted weather balloons and other air-bome objects. Colonel pointed out that the Commanders of the various areas are charged with the security of those areas. Reports concerning flying saucers received at this time will be investigated by the Area Commander and his report submitted to the Air Force Intelligence Division as an intelligence item. Major and Lieutenant Colonel made the observation that many of the reported sightings of flying saucers at this time appear to be an outgrowth of recent magazine articles. They reiterate that the Air Force is conducting no active investigation to determine whether flying saucers exist or what they might be. You will recall that the investigation of flying saucers was discontinued by the Bureau in October 1947, in order that the Air Force could take over such investigations.\" The student of ufology will recognize the standard Air Force technique'for reducing the importance of UFO reports in the mind of the reader: first point out that most reports can be explained, and then point out that the Air Force is not sufficiently interested to carry out a research project to study UFOs (\"flying saucers\"). The Major and the Lieutenant Colonel did not directly answer Hoover's questions about the \"facts re flying saucers\" and what the Air Force was thinking about them. They merely stated their answers in such a way that would lead Hoover to believe that the Air Force was taking no further interest in flying saucers because most reports (with the implication that all reports) could be explained. One notes in this document some of the first evidence of the effects of \"self-brainwashing\" that the Air Force had been carrying out ever since late 1948: Flying Saucers couldn't exist, and therefore they don't. All reports must be misidentifications, hoaxes, (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"(FBI, Continued) publicity stunts, etc. By 1950 the \"underlings\" in the Air Force apparently believed that their predecessors in 1947, 1948, and\" 1949 had solved the UFO mystery by proving, that all UFO reports could be explained. In following years (and even to today in 1978) the effects of Air Force self-brainwashing are evident: the Air Force still does not admit the possibility that UFOs are anything unusual despite \"mountains\" of evidence, much of which is within the Air Force Blue Book file, which point to new phenomena. Continued Appearance of Unexplained Phenomena. Consider- ing the apparent lack of interest in UFO reports by the Air Force, as expressed in Mr. Ladd's memorandum to Hoover, Mr. Ladd was probably surprised to receive in August 1950 the following memorandum (see also reference 66): \"Subject: Summary of Aerial Phenomena in New Mexico Purpose: To advise that: (1) OSI has expressed concern in connection with the continued appearance of unexplained phenomena described as green fireballs, discs and meteors (emphasis by present author) in the vicinity of sensitive installations in New Mexico. (2) Dr. Lincoln LaPaz, Meteor Expert of the University of New Mexico, reported that the phenomena does not appear to be of meteoric origin. (3) OSI has contracted with Land-Air Inc., of Alamogdrdo, New Mexico, to make scientific study of the unexplained phenomena. Nature of Phenomena: Observa- tions of aerial phenomena occurring within the vicinity of sensitive installations have been recorded by the Air Force since December 1948. The phenomena have been classified into 3 general types which are identified as follows: 1) Green fireballs, objects moving at high speed in shapes resembling half moons, circles, and discs emitting green light. 2) Discs (emphasis by present author), round, flat shaped objects or phenomena moving at fast velocity and emitting a brilliant white light or reflected light. 3) Meteors, aerial phenomena 10 resembling meteoric material moving at high velocity and varying in color. The above phenomena have been reported to vary in color from brilliant white to amber, red, and green. Since 1948, approximately 150 observations of aerial phenomena referred to above have been recorded in the vicinity of installations in New Mexico. A number of observations have been reported by different individuals at approximatey the same time.\" \"Results of an Inquiry by Professor Lincoln La Paz: Lincoln La Paz, Institute of Meteorics, University of New Mexico, submitted an analysis of the various observations on May 23, 1950. He concluded, as a result of his investigation, that approximately half of the phenomena recorded were of meteoric origin. The other phenomena commonly referred to as green fireballs or discs he believed to be U.S. guided missiles being tested in the neighborhood of the installations. (Note by present author: the report referred to here is in the FBI file. It lists 209 observations from January 19, 1948, through May 1,1950. About 45 of these are identified as \"disc or variation\".) La Paz pointed out that if he were wrong in interpreting the phenomena as originating with U.S. guided missiles that a systematic investigation of the observations should be made immediately. La Paz pointed out that missiles moving with velocities of the order of those found for the green fireballs and discs could travel from the Ural region of the USSR to New Mexico in less than 15 minutes. He suggested that the observations might be of guided missiles launched from bases in the Urals. On the basis of the investigations made by La Paz and the Air Force, it was concluded that the occurrence of the unexplained phenomena in the vicinity of sensitive installations was a cause for concern. The Air Force entered into a contract with Land-Air, Incorporated, Alamogordo, New Mexico, for the purpose of making scientific studies of the green fireballs and discs. It was pointed out in the summary furnished by OSI on July 19, 1950, that the unexplained green fireballs and discs are still observed in the vicinity of sensitive military and Government installations.\" \"Results of Air Force Investigation: The Air Force together with Land- Air, Incorporated, have established a number of observation posts in the vicinity of Vaughn, New Mexico, for the purpose of photographing and determining the speed, height, and nature of the unusual phenomena referred to as green fireballs and discs. On May 24, 1950, personnel of Land Air, Incorporated, sighted 8 to 10 objects of aerial phenomena (emphasis by present author). A 24-hour day watch is being maintained and has been designated \"Project Twinkle\". \"Conclusions: The Albuquerque office, in a letter dated August 10, 1950, advised that there have been no new developments in connection with the efforts to ascertain the identity of the strange aerial pehomena referred to as green fireballs and discs. The Albuquerque Office advised that, , Project Engineer, had been informed of the Bureau jurisdiction relative to espionage and sabotage and arrangements have been made so that the Bureau will be promptly advised in the event additional information relative to this project indicates any jurisdiction on the part of the Bureau. Action: None. The above is for your information.\" The above FBI document indicates that the Air Force was indeed very worried about \"fireballs and discs\" despite the public pronouncements of non-interest. It is interesting to note that \"Project Twinkle\" was set up to study discs as well as fireballs. The document which contained Dr. La Paz's summary of May 23,1950, is itself quite interesting, as are the comments by Dr. La Paz. The document begins with a letter from Lt. Col. Doyle Rees to Brig. Gen. Joseph Carroll, Director of Special Investigations in Washington, D.C. Following Col. Rees' letter is a table containing a list of 209 sightings, mostly from the New Mexico area. Of these about 45 are categorized as \"disk"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"or variation,\" and as many as 97 may be missing from the Blue Book microfilm file (I haven't been able to check all cases listed). These cases would, presumably, be in the OSI section of the microfilm record, however. In order to present a rather high level Air Force Intelligence opinion of the green fireball- disk phenomena in the southwest,! will now present the letter by Col. Rees and parts of the letter by Dr. La Paz. 67 Observers Whose Reliabilities are Not Questioned. Col. Rees entitled his letter \"Summary of Observations of Aerial Phenomena in the New Mexico Area, December 1948- May 1950\" and then continued as follows: \"1. In a liason meeting with other military and government intelligence and investigative agencies in December 1948, it was determined that the frequency of unexplained aerial phenomena in the New Mexico Area was such that an organized plan of reporting these observations should be undertaken. The organization and physical location of units of this District were most suitable for collecting these data, therefore, since December 1948, this District has assumed responsibility for collecting and reporting basic information with respect to aerial phenomena occurring in this general area. These reports have been distributed to . the Air Material Command, USAF, in accordance with Air Intelligence Requirements No. 4, and to other interested military and government agencies.\" (Note by present author: this refers to the Intelligence Memorandum No. 4 which the FBI and other agencies received in February 1949 from the Director of Intelligence of the Air Force. It contained a request for information on \"flying discs\" and other unidentified aerial phenomena, described reporting procedures and channels, and contained a prototype sighting form. This document has been discussed in a previous \"installment\" of these FBI papers.) \"2. There is attached, as a part of this summary, a compilation of aerial phenomena sightings that have occurred mostly in the New Mexico area and have been reported by this District Office subsequent to December 1948. This compilation of sightings is not a complete record of all reported observations, but includes only those in which sufficient information was available to justify their inclusion. The observers of these phenomena include scientists, Special Agents of the Office of Special Investigations (IG) USAF, airline pilots, military pilots, Los Alamos Security Inspectors, military personnel, and many other persons of various occupations whose reliability is not questioned . (emphasis by present author). This compilation sets forth the most important characteristics with respect to each observation and evaluated each sighting into one of three classifications, (1) green fireball phenomenon, (2) disc or variation, and (3) probably meteoric.\" \"3. There is also attached an analysis of the green fireball occurrences in this area made by Dr. Lincoln La Paz. Dr. La Paz is the Director of the Institute of Meteorics and Head of the Department of Mathematics and Astronomy at the University of New Mexico. He was Research Mathematician at the New Mexico Proving Grounds under an OSRD appointment in 1943 and 1944, and Director of the Operations Analysis Section, Headquarters, Second Air Force, 1944-45. Since 1948, Dr. La Paz has served on a voluntary basis as consultant for this District in connection with the green fireball investigations.\" \"4. On 17 February 1949 66 and again on 14 October 1949, conferences were held at Los Alamos, New Mexico, for the purpose of discussing the green fireball phenomena. Representatives of the following organizations were present at these meetings: Fourth Army, Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, University of New Mexico, Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, University of California, U.S. Air Force Scientific Advisory Board, Geophysical Research Division Air Materiel Command USAF, and the Office of Special Investigations (IG) USAF. A logical explanation was not proffered with respect to the origin of the green fireballs. It was, however, generally concluded that the phenomena existed and that they should be studied scientifically until these occurrences have been satisfactorily explained. Further, that the continued occurrence of unexplained phenomena of this nature in the vicinity of sensitive installations is cause for concern.\" \"5. The Geophysical Research Division, Air Material Command, Cambridge, Massachusetts, has recently let a contract to Land-Air, Inc., Holloman AFB, Alamogordo, New Mexico, for a limited scientific study of green fireballs. The results of this scientific approach to the problem will undoubtedly be of great valye in determining the origin of these phenomena.\" \"6. This summary of observations of aerial phenomena has been prepared for the purpose of re-emphasizing and reiterating the fact that phenomena have continuously occurred in the New Mexico skies during the past 113 months and are continuing to occur, and, secondly, that these phenomena are occurring in the vicinity of sensitive military and government installations.\" (signed: Doyle Rees, Lt. Col. USAF) Following this letter by Col. Rees is the list of 209 observations, to which I have previously referred. One of the cases in this list involved about 100 very reliable observers. Listed as case number 24, it took place February 17, 1949, near Albuquerque, New Mexico. An object described as brilliant white shifting to peach color was observed for about 6 minutes. There was no sound. It was described as round, shifting to an elliptical shape. Its angular size was comparable to the moon (i.e'., \"one lunar diameter\"). The object travelled west to east and then \"disappeared.\" In the Blue Book files the object is listed as an \"aircraft\" (which it undoubtedly was — an \"aircraft\" of some sort. But anyone who can't distinguish the wings and fuselage of a terrestrial aircraft when it is. close enough to have an angular size cpmparable to that of the moon had better have his eyes examined). Appended to the list of 209 observations is an analysis of the sighting listed as number 175 which took place during the night of 24-25 (continued on next page) 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"MUFON-CES (German Speaking Section of MUFON) Conducts Fifth Annual Symposium On the weekend of September 29 through October 1, 1978, MUFON- CES held its fifth annual UFO symposium at NaturwissenschaftHche Institute der Universitat (Nature and Science Institute of the University,) 7400 Tubingen, Germany.

This case deserves special mention because it involved a photograph. This object was seen and photographed by a reliable observer who described the object as being white and changing to red and green. It was seen travelling toward the northwest from Datil, New Mexico, the location of the observer. It had a train or trail, covered about. 1° every two minutes, and was observed for about 2 l / 2 hours before it \"disappeared.\" Although this sounds like the typical misidentification of a bright star or planet, the photograph makes such an identification impossible. According to Dr. Lincoln La Paz, who analyzed the photograph, 12 \"a. The angular diameter of the perfectly round luminous object Stanfield observed was approxi- mately Yn of a degree, b. The angular velocity of the object in the sky was greater than half a degree per minute.\" These characteristics of the sighting led La Paz to conclude \"that on the basis of the results (a) and (b) above, the object seen by Stanfield was not the moon (for the angular diameter was too small), it was not Venus or any other planet (for the angular diameter was too large), it was not a bright fixed star slightly out of focus (for the observed rate of motion is double that due to the diurnal rotation of the earth).\" Dr. La Paz did not speculate upon what the round, luminous object might have been. However, he was apparently not able to identify it as a normal sky phenomenon. Is this, then, some long-awaited photographic evidence that has been \"hidden\" in Air Force files for years?

She had been struck down with a massive cerebral hemorrhage the afternoon of August 11, 1978. Bobbie's life seemed dramatic and quick-paced. She clashed through it with style and verve, her red, hair capping her lively face and her nimble mind blazing through her written words. Her personality was generous and open. If she called herself your friend, you were treasured indeed. She was far too young to die, especially in the manner in which death came. But she had been living with stressful situations—too many, for too long. There is a limit to human endurance—even Bobbie Ann's. Those acquainted with SAGA and UFO REPORT knew her as a talented writer, B. Ann Slate. Those of more intimate acquaintance knew her as Barbara Ann Gironda. No matter which name she was known by, she was appreciated for her talent and her humanity, When a young person dies, we try to seek comfort by relating their passage to some precious aspect of life. Now our tears, strained through grief, form into a crystal model. It is the abundance of life. Bobbie loved the abundance of nature, especially the lost creatures of God's creation. She was one of those rare individuals who can not bear to see a nomad dog pass forlornly by, or to hear a ragged cat begging at the door. She took in strays of all shapes, forms, and color of fur. Her backyard was a veritable zoo in' which homeless animals—domesti- cated and wild alike—found a temporary or permanent home. ' Bobbie Ann's home was torn by the recent violent rainstorms which battered the Southland. The wind and rain opened holes in heir roof, spreading damage and havoc into rooms below. The final storm left several little casualties in her attic—a nest of baby 'possums, deserted by their mother. Unprotected, they fell between the walls and landed next to the wall heater. Realizing what had happened, Bobbie promptly tore a hole through the wall to rescue them. She was acting as surrogate mother to these foundlings when she found another pack of deserted baby 'possums in her woodpile. Undaunted—for Bobbie Ann was dauntless—she raised both broods, parceling some out to a zoo and keeping the rest. If the reader is wondering what this has to do with UFOs, it should be explained that Bobbie lived in a heavily settled, though wooded suburb of Los Angeles. In many of the hill communities of this sprawling metropolis, wildlife teems in the midst of the city. Therefore, opossums in Bobbie's attic and woodpile were not surprising. It is an example of the abundance of creation. Life is spread thickly over this planet from the bottom of the oceans to the furthest reach of Antarctic rocks. Therefore, why is it incredible to some people that UFOs exist? It is reasonable to assume that life exists in abundance throughout the universe. It is not limited to our physical universe, if metaphysics has anything to teach us. It lives as well in planes of existence besides our own. Bobbie Ann was accepting of all kinds of life. For three years she tracked the ephemeral California Bigfoot, which in recent years appeared inexplicably in the desert Palmdale area and the adjacent Angeles Crest Mountains. She never found her Bigfoot, except for footprints and other secondhand evidence. But her careful research during those years convinced her of his existence. She was puzzled, too, by his seeming connection at times with the UFO phenomenon and the possibility that he was of intradimensional origin. She was always open and accepting of him, for to her he was but another example of the abundance of life. She left behind a fascinating book, BIGFOOT, co-authored with Alan Berry. In it, we see her love of the unknown and her insatiable curiosity. Her desire was to extend man's knowledge beyond the limits of this too- „ small world. Many Southland researchers were Bobbie's friends, as well as numerous others around the country. For she included people in her love of life's abundance. With her human friends, as with' the creatures of the wild and the mysterious Bigfoot, she was accepting and non-judgmental. Such friends are precious treasures. There are so very few to whom one can talk, and be listened to, understood and sustained. Bobbie Ann was that kind of friend, and I shall miss her sorely. So we say a temporary farewell to you, Bobbie. You are doubtless engaged in some fantastic adventure on another plane, perhaps studying the UFO, or tracking the Bigfoot, and learning more about these mysteries than you ever were able to learn about them here. We will see you again—in a better place, in a happier time—or perhaps in a timeless place where all knowledge is available to those who seek, in an eternal Now. 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"UFO ENTITIES IN AUSTRALASIA, 1977-A SUMMARY By Keith Basterfield Through the years there have been something close to 100 reported observations of unusual entities which the observers have linked to the UFO phenomenon. The Australian Entity Study Group 1 has collected these accounts and published them both as summaries, and in a few cases, as ih-depth investigated \"Case docu- ments.\" 2 Last year there were five such observations which came to the attention of Australian UFO research organizations, and these provide a very good insight into the type of reports which have been received and investigated, going back in some cases to the 19th century. The first report for 1977 came from Tasmania on February 3, when some children reported that they had observed a very unusual object in the sky at about 9:30 PM. The children were at a youth camp, when one of them heard a noise, and upon looking up saw a stationary \"something\", which then moved behind some nearby trees. It appeared dome shaped and on it there were a row of \"windows,\" about its middle. An area of disc-shaped light was seen spinning below it. There were also flashing white-yellow lights on the edge of the disc, and a red light on the dome top. One side of the center window revealed something which looked like a thin figure with a bump or rounded head. It seemed to be moving back and forth in this window. Another child also noted the same object about the trees, and described it as being like \"two saucers stuck together.\" It was spinning fast as she first saw it, then slowed down. A figure was visible in what appeared to be windows before the object moved southwards emitting a faint whining noise. The figure seemed to be thin with a largish rounded head above what the girl described as a high collar. There 14 was an arm visible to the left. Finally the object went behind trees and passed from their vision. 3 Several months went by before the next encounter — a rather exotic and quite out of the ordinary entity report describing a prolonged visit by alien beings to a Queensland prospector on June 22. 4 The prospector saw three lights in the sky at about 11 PM. The lights landed near his camp near Bultoo River, in southwest Queensland. The man said that this was his fourth experience with such phenomena in 5 years, all in the same area. In 1973 a group of 16 objects hovered over him, before moving away, while in May 1974 a \"cigar\" hovered near the ground and he saw a \"woman\" in a window in it, and a \"man\" in the object's cockpit. Later, in 1976, a brilliantly lit object was seen and many things occurred which he did not wish to relate. Family Group? On this latest occasion (1977), he described how after the object landed, figures emerged, played games with lightning balls, and he watched as they materialized and dematerialized. They told him they came from \"Begua,\" although didn't elaborate where this was relative to the Earth. There were women dressed in summer type clothes and men dressed in grey business style suits. Both sexes appeared human though their skin was a blue-grey color. The objects they arrived in were slim cylinders some 50 meters tall, with each one of the three supporting itself on five legs. After two days of stopping with him, the visitors left in their ships leaving no physical trace of their stay. This account from a lonely prospector in the middle of nowhere reminded me of a gold prospector who lived near Tully, North Queensland, who in 1974 made some remarkable claims about finding a crashed spaceship and a cat-like entity. The story sounded very authentic when told by the prospector but lacked one iota of physical proof. However, that's another story in itself. It wasn't until October during a number of West Australian close encounters that another possible entity report emerged. On the 16th of that month a disc-shaped object had been seen at close range in broad daylight near Meekatharra, by a group of 12 people, and although investigated by the RAAF, even they put an \"unknown\" tag on it. The following day a group of people, eight in all, drove out to the Mount Magnet rubbish dump, after two people claimed they had seen lights descending to the ground in that vicinity. The group saw \"round, pulsating green and red objects\" landed in a paddock about 3 km from the town. A Mr. Freestone reported, \"There seemed to be a mist around them... there appeared to be objects on the ground around them. You could distinguish them with the naked eye, but as soon as you put a spotlight on them they disappeared. They would be something like human size, they weren't animals.\" 5 Dog-napping The last two entity reports for the year came from the Waimata Valley area, near Gisborne, New Zealand. About 3 AM on the. morning of December 2, a farmer was awakened by the barking of his dogs. He grabbed a torch (flashlight) and went to investigate. Opening the back door he saw a landed object nearby. He picked up a rifle and walked towards it. The object had a metallic outer shell which glowed bright blue, and doors which opened into an intensely bright red interior. Looking toward the dog kennels he saw two humanoid figures carrying one of the dogs between them and heading for the object.

They must be considered unverified until subject to some first-hand investigation. Submitted by Jane Thomas.) Santiago, Chile—Alejandro Hernandez Perez reported that on September 24 he and his son were abducted on board a craft manned by beings who he believed were from an advanced terrestrial civilization. They spoke in Spanish in a \"firm and steady voice, although with a metallic sound like that of a speaker talking through a microphone.\" He was asked not to reveal what was discussed pending a new predicted encounter. (La Razon, Buenos Aires, 9/28/78.) Jujuy Province, Argentina—Two young girls, 6 and 10, reported seeing through a window the humanoid form of a strange being with a ray of light from its chest as it advanced toward them. \"It had ugly eyes, the face as with scratches, the neck the color of fire with hair that seemed white and was very tall.\" At the same time, neighbors saw a flying object \"the color of which changed when it changed position.\" (Cronica, Buenos Aires, 10/7/78.) San Miguel de Tucuman, Argentina—Investigating noises in a store in this sugar and citrus town, an employee and friends found two short humanoids dressed in brilliant blue tight-fitting suits. They were holding a \"weapon\" resembling a hair drier. Telepathic messages allegedly were received that the beings wanted to take one of them aboard their craft. The beings had pockmarked, \"unpleasant\" faces and they \"wore a kind of brilliant object\" at ear level, and appeared and disappeared from one spot to another inside the store. The witnesses became frightened and fled! (Cronica; Buenos Aires, 9/29/78.)' San Luis Province, Argentina— The President of a UFO group brought to Mendoza a young man, Miguel Freitas, 23, a wood cutter, who told police he had been forcibly taken on board an unknown vehicle where\" its crew conducted tests, questioned him, and then gave him several \"presents.\" Freitas said that on August 30 at about 1630 hours; while taking a break from work, he saw a vehicle approach to within 2 meters. A humanoid figure bathed in bluish light emerged and approached him, hands forward. No face or lower limbs could be seen. When Freitas tried to flee, the being pushed a button on its chest and Freitas was paralyzed. Inside the craft a grayish substance was smeared on his mouth and needles were stuck in his arm. The nature of the \"questioning\" was not described. Near dusk, Freitas was released in a remote spot about 35 or 40 km from where he worked, carrying off several objects including \"a box from which the beings' voices came out.\" This he abandoned on the spot, but the other' objects .reportedly were given to the San Luis police. Freitas underwent psycho- logical and medical tests, with normal results except that he proved to have a very low IQ. A handkerchief he had used to wipe his mouth was analyzed and found to contain a dye resembling a powerful bactericide, but the species\" could not be determined. (Cronica, Buenos Aires, 9/27/78.) In a round-up article on UFOs, Cronica (Sept. 30) noted something that will be familiar to students of past \"contactee\" cases: \"The most fascinating events are those of more direct contacts, which in some cases (continued on nexf pagej were about 1.4 m tall and wore close- fitting metallic silver overalls and white, opaque helmets. The overalls were, he noticed, gathered at the ankles with elastic cuffs which extended over red glowing boots. On their hands were large, silver gauntlets with flared arm coverings extending halfway up to their forearms. The white helmets were rounded with large motorbike helmet features, and rose, from shoulder to shoulder without markings or openings. Alarmed, the farmer fired at one of the humanoids and apparently \"winged\" him. The entities dropped the dog, with the one injured entity running off into some nearby bushes, while the other one ran into the object. The doors were seen to fold shut and the entire thing left at great speed. The dog, which had appeared unconscious stood up groggily, then jumped around barking. The farmer said he later found markings and \"ripple sole shoe\" footprints at the site. 6 This attempted kidnapping brings back memories of the October 1957 American wave of occupant cases where dogs were involved; arid a case from near Clarei South Australia, in about 1971 where an object reportedly shone a beam of light onto a dog, and beamed it up into the object which left, right in front of a farmer's nose. 7 The same area of New Zealand was also involved in our last case which occurred on December 8, when a smallish \"man\" was encountered on a road. The entity was wearing a silver suit, bright red boots, no helmet, and tried to flag down a car. Appearing some 1.45 m tall, the entity waved frantically, and jumped up and down to attract the driver's attention. However, the car driver deemed it wiser not to stop! 8 . So, that was 1977, the year of the humanoids. What's, in store for 1978? We shall have to wait until, the final score is in, early in 1979. ' NOTES 1.

He was with a group of children on the slopes of the Chateau de Baron, Puy-de-Dome, when they came upon two \"personages\" dressed in shiny silvery diving suits, their heads covered with enormous, helmets with wide circular visors. The two were taking stones from a broken drystone wall and putting them into a rectangular box that seemed to be made of the same material as their suits and helmets. They moved slowly and stiffly, \"like a slow motion film,\" carrying the 1 or 2 kg hunks of native basalt in front of them with both hands. M. DLV and the children watched unobserved for about 2 minutes then turned and fled. They saw no machine in the air or on the ground, although one could have been hidden behind the bushes that surrounded the field. Sud-Quest, October 9,1954: M. Manes Guesurtia of Mendionde (Basses- Pyrenees) was on his way to work on the morning of October 7, 1954, when he noticed at a distance a strange object that seemed to be shaped like a mushroom. Walking across the field towards it, he saw on the grass two red engins about 2 m in diameter. Beside them stood two little men about 80 cm tall. The two little men gestured to him, indicating that he should enter one of the machines. They entered the other one, and it rose into the air without a sound. Looking through the open door of the other object, M. Guesurtia saw a third little man. Suddenly the door was closed and the second object also took off, displacing a slight current of air. Neighbors said that they saw nothing, but they found the grass on the prairie crushed and yellow. 16 La Charente Libre (edition of Angouleme) October 11, 1954: About eleven o'clock on the night of October 8-9, 1954, M. Puygelier saw overhead near the town of Bel-Air a luminous elongated object, resembling a gigantic egg, which descended close to the ground, oscillated a few seconds, then landed behind a hedge near the, road. He drove on to St. Claud in fright, but then returned with another witness. Where the craft had been seen, they could make out in the darkness a human silhouette standing motionless on the roadside. At this place the next morning a strip of burned vegetation 3 meters long was found, surrounded by an area where the grass was trampled. La Charente Libre (edition of Angouleme), October 12, 1954: About four o'clock in the afternoon M. Jean Bertrand, a mechanic of Carcasonne, saw a spherical object flying at low altitude. Its lower part seemed to be made of shining metal and the upper part of plastic. He said that he could see two human forms inside the machine before it disappeared at high speed toward the east. El Universal, Caracas, December 9, 1954: In Chacao, a suburb of Caracas, witnesses said that they were able to get close to \"interplanetary\" craft that landed at various parts of town and even to touch the crew members. One witness, Tomas Betancourt, claimed to have . grappled with one of the \"Martians.\" \"He was gelatinous and very slippery,\" said Betancourt, \"and got out of my hands.\" LDLN #130, December 12,1973: In the summer of 1954 at Bette, Creuse, a worker was returning home .on a bicycle at about 11PM when suddenly a circle of light descended from the sky and landed in a field near the road. Out of it came two human-like beings wearing helmets with antennas. He tried to accelerate, but he had the feeling that he was pedaling in a vacuum. A peasant in the area also claimed to have seen strange individuals in the countryside. Depeche du Midi, June 3, 1977; also Midi Libre, June 4, 1977, Toulouse: In March, 1974, a man who now lives in Toulouse relates that he was driving back to Fleurance-du-Gers from Laujuzen (near Nogaro) at about 3:00 AM when, rounding a curve on the road, his car stopped for no apparent reason. Ahead of him he saw a creature about 90 cm in height,' a biped with very large feet and with arms so long that he \"could not tell whether it had any hands.\" When first seen the creature was standing with its back towards the car, but it immediately moved down - into a ditch beside the road so that only the upper half of the body was visible. \"He was all green,\" said the witness, \"had pointed ears on the top of his head, and very black eyes.\" Soon the motor started and the witness drove on. He saw no UFO, no strange lights. (continued on next page) (Humanoids, continued) ended up in a dialogue with presumed extraterrestrials.

Masseron, sleeping in his trailer at Franceville- Camping (Calvados) on January 10, 1976, was awakened by blows against the wall and a scratching sound, followed by a violent shaking of the vehicle. Looking out of the window, he saw a few meters away a luminous egg- shaped object, the upper part glowing green and the lower part, red. About a yard high, it seemed to be resting on the ground. While he watched, the object lifted in a spiral trajectory, emitting a strident whine that grew louder as it ascended to about 15 rh. There it stopped, hovered, and suddenly disappeared. As he went out the door to investigate, M. Masseron heard a scratchy voice, \"like a Walkie-Talkie,\" that seemed to be giving him a message, but all he could remember later was \"L.P.X...L.P.X.\" Attracted by a movement off to the left, he turned to see the silhouette of a man-like creature quickly crossing the road, moving, he said, \"crosswise\" on the axis of the prolongation of the right leg. Two trailers away, a Mrs. Zamora was awakened by a voice asking, \"What shall I do?\" Another voice answered/ \"Do as I do.\" She went to her window where she heard the same sort of garbled message that Masseron described. At apparently the same spot where he had seen the egg-shaped object, she saw a luminous circle, the top green and the bottom red, rising, falling, and \"pitching.\" By the time her husband went to the door and turned on the outside light, the luminous circle was gone, but the \"message\" was still audible. Investigation later that night found strange footprints in the area toward which the figure Masseron saw had been moving.

Don is a professor and department head at Missouri Southern State College in Joplin, Mo., where he heads up the crime laboratory. George and Don are presently very involved in UFO landing cases in Barry County. These will be published in the Journal as the investigated reports are received and the lab analysis completed.. One of MUFON's original members, David J. Gras in Buffalo, N.Y., has reluctantly submitted his resignation as State Section Director for Erie and Niagara Counties due to other added responsibilities.

Dr. Buffington is a retired astrophysicist and has been an amateur radio operator for 53 years with the present call letters of W6AJH. He plans to participate in MUFON's amateur radio nets on Saturday mornings. It is conceivable that he and others may start a UFO net for California \"hams.\" Lt. Col. Robert F. Bowker, USAF Retired, State Section Director for Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties and a consultant in radar has proposed such a net for several years, because of the skip distance inconsistencies on the 20 meter band to the midwest and east coast.

Roses and accolades to Marvin E. Taylor, Jr., State Section Director for Tuolumme and Calaveras Counties in California, and his fantastic MUFON members for their prize winning float in Sonora, Calif., during their annual two day \"Mother Lode Roundup\" parade. A photograph of this fabulous float, depicting the Devils Tower in Wyoming, inspired by the film \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind,\" and a rotating model of a UFO 65 feet in circumference graced the float built upon a flat bed semi-trailer rig, appeared on the front page of The Daily Union Democrat for May 15,1978. The float required 30 days and nights to build and has been used in several other parades, however, its immense size was a handicap in transporting it to adjacent cities. The project grew in such proportions that it was entered in the Commercial Division as a cooperative venture by the Mutual UFO Network, Taylor Reality, and Brookside Crafts, where it won first prize. Another article appeared in the July 17,1978, edition of the same newspaper relating the details behind the construction of the float and the people responsible. We hope to publish a photograph of the float in a subsequent issue of the Journal as an example of the enthusiasm and fine public relations for MUFON that Marvin Taylor and his people have generated. GSW Annual Lecture GSW's annual lecture will be held at the Adams Hotel, intersections of Central Ave. and Adams in downtown Phoenix, on January 12, 1979. This year's lecture will start at 7:30 PM. The subject will be part two of the \"UFO Cover-Up, Proof of the First, Second and Third Kinds\", with the featured speaker being William H. Spaulding, Director of GSW's operations. Spaulding will update the media and public on the latest information obtained from GSW's legal action against the CIA. The startling data will be supported by government documents and papers. The lecture will detail, in a serious, yet technically light tone, UFO cases previously not reported to the public. The second portion of the lecture will include a graphic visual slide show of UFO photographs and other pertinent information. This way GSW believes the organization can supply a full spectrum of UFO information to a diversified audience and satisfy all interests. The facilities of the Adams Hotel are very appropriate for the slide presentation, with a wide angle projection screen and a high ceiling for optimum viewing. Tickets will be $3.00 for adults and $2.00 for all students with proper ID's and will be available at the door the evening of the lecture. Special seating and reserve tickets are available through GSW's office and may be obtained by calling (602) 942-7216 after 5:00 PM. Proceeds of the lecture will go to the costs of GSW's continuing legal action against the CIA and other governmental organizations that are suppressing UFO information."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Lucius Farish In Others' Words UFO NEWSCUPPING SERVICE The September 26 issue of NATIONAL ENQUIRER reported that various NASA engineers and scientists have formed an \"underground network\" to study UFO reports. UFO reports from an area southwest of London, England are detailed in the October 3 issue. Brazilian reports of huge cylindrical objects and formations of smaller UFOs are featured in the October 17 ENQUIRER issue. The September 19 issue of THE STAR speculates on the possible role of space shuttle astronauts in tracking UFOs in space. Sightings of UFOs by Coast Guard personnel in the Lake Michigan area on July 28, 1978, are outlined in the September 16 issue. As I have mentioned in previous columns, NATIONAL ENQUIRER and THE STAR are usually the more reliable of the various weekly tabloid newspapers. For this reason, they are the only ones whose articles I mention. Another tabloid, MODERN PEOPLE, has recently been carrying UFO material which, in some cases, is highly suspect. For instance, the October 8 issue contains an article alleging that the crew of the balloon Double Eagle II was harrassed by UFOs on their record-setting trans-Atlantic flight. The crew, members were \"ordered by agents of the U.S. government not to discuss the strange occurrence,\" according to the article. This has all the earmarks of being absolute fiction, yet it is apparently being taken seriously by some UFO researchers. Attempts always should be made to check out such stories in any of the tabloids before accepting them as valid reports. An article by Alex Evans in the November issue of FATE contains some very interesting humanoid . reports from 1913 and 1919 that have been reported to the Center for UFO Studies. This issue also has an article by James Oberg discussing (from his super-skeptic position) the implications of, and controversy surrounding, Robert K.G. Temple's book, THE SIRIUS MYSTERY. The November issue of UFO REPORT features a report on cattle mutilations, an interview with British UFOlogist, Gordon Creighton, and other items of interest, including excerpts from the Lorenzens' book, ABDUCTED!, and Erich von Daniken's latest work, VON DANIKEN'S PROOF. UFO REPORT now will be published only 9 times per year, beginning with the January 1979 issue. OMNI is a new monthly magazine containing both science-fiction and science-fact material. If the first (October) issue is an example of what may be expected in the future, the cover price of $2.00 per issue is hardly justified. James Oberg is contributing the \"UFO Update\" column for each issue, so we need not expect those reports to be unbiased and objective.

Following the luncheon, a series of motion picture UFO films will be shown for the edification of the Political Committee. The noted French scientist, Dr. Claude Poher will then address this distinguished assemblage. A press conference is scheduled after Dr. Poher's presentation. The Special Political Committee will then convene to discuss this important issue with the goal of determining what action they should take at this time or planning for the future. Peter Tomakawa, one of our very active members, will attend as an observer, reporting the progress to the MUFON UFO Journal.

It is based on actual CIA and Air Force reports never before made public and is presented by Pentagon personnel with firsthand experience in the field of UFOs. It investigates historic and contemporary evidence of UFOs. . .including official photographs from Gemini, Apollo, and Skylab II missions. It recreates a reported landing of extraterrestrials on a U.S. Air Force Base, and concludes . witfra thought : provoking discussion by : - several social. psychologists of the _ possible public reaction to the - confirmation of this landing. *' Allan Sandier predicts that with \"the continuing growth of interest in UFOs, this definitive and entertaining film will remain a classic in demand for years to come. It is hosted by Rod Serling and has a running time of 52 minutes. Dr. David M. Jacobs, of Temple University in Philadelphia, Pa., served as the historical technical advisor for the film. He was eminently qualified for this, important role due to his fine work as author of the book The UFO Controversy in America (Indiana University Press, 1975). Speaking of books, two have recently been published either authored, by or chapters written by MUFON members and consultants, and are recommended reading. The first is published in Spanish and authored by one of our research specialists Vicente-Juan Ballester Olmos, Guardia Civil, 9, D-16, Valencia - 10, Spain.
