Wilhclm The following narrative report with photographs .and drawings is being published in the Journal because it is a fine example of the techniques employed in collecting the essential ingredients and data from a UFO landing trace case. Even though the ultimate results are not as significant as the Delphos, Kansas case of November 2, 1971, the investigators involved demonstrate the procedures recommended in the third edition of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual. This report should be a guide and incentive to train more investigative teams to have this capability Walt Andrus, Interim Editor On April 10th, 1983, an unknown craft landed in Ross, Ohio. The unknown object was initially observed by two separate motorists. Mrs. X was driving on Layhigh Road near Route 748 leaving Ross, Ohio, when she noticed a large bright white light to her right. As the object got closer, the lights in the car started to flicker and her car's engine almost stalled-out. She first thought it was a plane, but then realized it was moving faster than a plane, plus it seemed that the object was coming down. After the object had passed her, the lights and car's engine returned to normal. She estimated that the time of her sighting was around 8:20 PM. Mr. Jeffries, the second motorist, was driving towards Layhigh Road on the Hamilton-New London Road when he saw the object. He too described the object as being a large bright white light. His car also acted in the same manner as Mrs. X's car when the object got closer. His car functioned normally after the object passed out of sight. Mr. Jeffries stated that the object was decreasing in speed and seemed to be descending. His sighting took place around 8:30 PM. Later that night, Mr. Jeffries contacted OUFOIL and reported his sighting. The main witness in this landing case, a Mr. C.H. (pseudonym), was watching television on the night of the incident. The vertical hold on his set started to roll and the lights in the house flickered. Mr. C.H. thought that someone' had again hit the utility pole down the road. As he started to go to the kitchen, the TV set went off entirely, along with the lights in the house. He assumed that there was a complete power failure. While looking for a flashlight, the TV set came back on and so did the lights in the house. Mr. C.H. made his way to the kitchen to look out his back door to see if someone had hit the utility pole. He stated that he couldn't see anything wrong, since there were no sparks or lights coming from that direction. Whjle all these events were happening inside the house, his dog continued barking. He thought that he could calm his dog down by going outside. Mr. C.H. felt that his dog had detected some animal, thus explaining his extensive barking. Mr. C.H. turned on the back porch light and went outside to calm his dog. He observed that the dog's hair was standing up on his back and that he was both growling and barking. When he tried to calm him down, the dog continued unabated. Mr. C.H. turned to the direction in which his dog was barking and that's when he saw a flicker of light down in the field. He estimated that the light was some 300 to 400 yards from the house. His first thought was that some kids were in the field, perhaps looking for night-crawlers. He directed his attention to the light source for several minutes, while trying to calm his dog. The light repeatedly changed from bright to dim. He called out, but got no response from anyone. Mr. C.H. then decided to go back into the house and call the sheriff. As he started into the house, the light source got very bright and his porch light went out. He turned quickly towards the source of the light and saw something rising in the air very slowly. He said the light was so bright, that it illuminated his entire field. When this thing got several hundred feet above the ground, the bright light dimmed and flickering lights could be observed. As this lighted object increased in altitude, it suddenly took off like a jet aircraft. After the unusual object had departed, his dog calmed down somewhat. Mr. C.H. then went back inside the house and took his dog with him. He found that the television set was now working normally and the lights were functioning properly. As Mr. C.H. sat in his chair, he wondered what he had witnessed. So many things ran through his head, he started to call the sheriff several times, but decided not to. While contemplating what had just happened, he remembered having called a UFO organization in 1974 about a previous sighting. His search disclosed that the organization and number was that of the Ohio UFO Investigators League. Mr. C.H. called and related what he had just witnessed. An interview was set-up that same night. He stated over the phone that he was a little shaken and would welcome the opportunity to talk to someone in person as soon as possible. OUFOIL sent three investigators, Ron Schaffner, Bill Johns and myself to investigate the case. We arrived at Mr. C.H.'s residence before 11:00 PM. It was obvious that the man was visibly shaken from some experience. We began our interview around 11:10 PM and finished at 12:22 AM. During the interview, Mr. C.H., related what he had witnessed and we asked tha appropriate questions. Preliminary tests were conducted to measure Mr. C.H.'s eyesight. After Mr. C.H. related his story, we replayed the tape for him to hear and to make additions or (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Landing Case, Continued ' corrections.:He had nothing to add at that time: At this point, we had Mr. C.H.'sign special legal forms giving us permission to investigate on his property. Ron Schaffner explained each and every form to Mr. C.H. Since it had been raining for several days, I called the Weather Bureau to determine if the rain was going to continue. The weather station said that there would be rain on-and-off all through the night and it would continue thru the next day. Having finished with the forms, we all proceeded to the landing area. During the'interview, BillJohns had gone to the area to check for any signs of. radiation. When we reached the; landing area, Bill stated that he could only pick- up normal background radiation'.' The area was checked with a portable survey meter model 3009. We could see ' the impression of something which had apparently landed. It looked like there.; was a burnt spot in the middle and there were many broken tree branches inside the impression. We assumed that the unknown craft had broken these branches,from the nearby tree,when , leaving the area. The branches weren't crushed or broken into smal| pieces. There \" seemed .to be a .small indentation in the ground left by the unknown craft. Because of the extremely wet ground, we recognized that an exact .weight measurement would be difficult. Ron was taking as many photos as possible, but with the rain coming down, we 'would have to determine later if they .were satisfactory. Since the weather conditions prevented us from conducting our field investigation, it was decided to protect the landing area from additional rain. We erected a waterproof cover over the landing area, which rested approximately one-half inch above the ground. At no time did we touch or enter the effected area. In order to prevent the cover from touching the ground, due to the weight of possible water resting on it; we used several' dozen air-filled balloons/and placed them under the cover „ for support. With the area well covered, we left the scene and planned to return early in the morning to conduct a full 4 Taking Core Sample Outside of Effected Area Testing Soil and Water Samples in the Field field investigation. When we returned the next morning, Ron began taking a whole series of photographs to document the area. While Ron was taking photos, Bill and I checked the area again for signs of radiation. This time we used a portable survey meter, model 3007 with a 3056 probe, 'which has a low background steel body for shielding background radiation. Each of us wore a dosimeter model 862 during the entire field investigation. These instruments were loaned to us by the Civil Defense. At no time did we ever detect radiation, except for the normal background. The next procedure was to remove the light weight cover which we had erected over the landing spot. The balloons accomplished their job. No part of the cover touched the landing area and no puddles of water had collected on the cover during the night. The cover was removed with great care"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Landing Case, Continued so as not to disturb the landing area. With the cover removed, we made a visual check of the landing area. The landing area looked normal, except for a burned spot in the center. The outer fringes of the landing spot seemed to be scorched. Inside the landing area there were several broken branches, which it is assumed the unknown craft knocked from a nearby tree when leaving. The surrounding area seemed to appear normal and it too had several broken branches; which came from the nearby tree. A series of photographs were taken by Ron to document the evidence. While Ron was busy taking photographs, Bill and I began setting up a directional line. We measured the landing area without going inside the effected area. It measured 50 feet in diameter. Our next procedure was to build a grid pattern over the effected area. When the grid was completed, it consisted of 24 different sections which would be investigated and identified independently. At 9:32 AM, I prepared to enter the first grid section for a search investigation. I was wearing proper protective clothing and carried the needed equipment. Each grid section was completely photographed before an entry was made. It is very necessary to photograph each section so the laboratory scientists will know where the samples were taken or where any unknown artifacts were found. After I throughly investigated each section, I also took a core sample from each one. The core samples were taken with an 18 inch galvanized pipe with a 1 inch diameter opening. Only 12 inches of the pipe was driven into the ground. Each sample removed was properly sealed and tagged to identify the section of its origin. At various points within the grid, I also took 36 inch depth soil samples with a Hoffer soil, sampler. It wasn't necessary to take a 36 inch core sample from each grid section, since the effected area showed no signs of , anything unusual. This was later confirmed when I performed a soil chemical test in the field. The tests showed that the soil hadn't been altered Branch Broken by Unknown Craft by the unknown craft. The soil test I performed was a simple test done with a LaMotte soil test kit. It is a kit which tests for preliminary investigation on soil reaction. It employs the simple spot plate method, using a single indicator solution covering acid, alkaline and neutral soils (pH 4.0 - 8.0). The ideal kit would have been the LaMotte soil reaction set. It employs the rapid plate method. It took me a total of 5 hours and 23 minutes to complete my investigation of the effected area. I took a total of twenty-four 18 inch core samples and six 36 inch core samples in the effected area. I collected a total of 18 various items, from scorched grass to a wilted spider, inside the effected area. While I was investigating the effected area, Bill was taking core samples and other items outside the effected area. He took a total of twelve 18 inch and six 36 inch depth samples of soil. Bill inspected the tree where the broken branches originated, while Ron made a series of photographs of the tree. No type of evidence, such as metal traces, indentations or residue, was found. Bill obtained a sample of sap from one of the broken branches. He placed this sample in a special culture plate and sealed it in a \"Gono-pak.\" Ron helped me gather water samples from the area. We wanted the lab to run a bacteriological analysis on the water found in the area. Water samples were taken with a professional water scoop (Model B1079WA). All samples were put in a standard \"Whirl- pak\" bag. These bags are very good for holding water samples. They have a white write-on strip for easy identification, plus there is also a 4 oz. fill-line, which serves as a guide to help the sample collector obtain the proper amount of water for standard test procedures. I also took water samples from the tree. These samples were placed on one well culture slides, which were placed into micro-slide mailers. These mailers are ideal for safe handling and will insure safe transferral to the laboratory. A total of 12 water samples were taken from the area. The next test we performed was measuring the ground compression. Due to the very wet ground and the angle of the slightly depressed soil, we felt that an accurate weight estimate would be almost impossible. However, we did run the test and the results indicated that the unknown craft weighed around 39,000 pounds. (Please remember, this is just an estimate.)

The temperature of the surface soil was 39 degrees. A total of 10 hours was involved in the field investigation activities. With our field investigation now completed, we packed-up our equipment and samples and returned to Mr. C.H.'s house. We spent some time with Mr. C.H. going over various aspects of the case before leaving. On our way home, we stopped at the laboratories and gave them the samples and all necessary information needed for their testing. When we got home, all of the equipment was cleaned and a list was made of what replacements were needed. After the equipment was cleaned, the three of us compared our notes so a report could be prepared. From all of the information gathered and the tests that we conducted in the field, we all agreed that nothing unusual was detected from the samples collected. We definitely didn't have a Delphos, Kansas situation, however we did agree that something had landed. Several days elapsed before we started receiving the laboratory reports on pur samples. I won't relate the technical data of those reports, but just a small summary of their findings. Anyone interested in -the laboratory data and maps, who are doing research into the geological and biological aspects related to UFO sightings, may obtain copies from OUFOIL. Among the 32 core samples and the 12 auger samples taken, inside and , outside the landing area, not one sample tested revealed anything out of the ordinary. Since there were no characteristic changes in the soil, only the basic tests were run. If something would have been found unusual, then many more precise tests would have been performed. Samples from the three foot diameter burned area in the middle of the landing area underwent special tests. These tests were for the purpose of checking for any type of combustible substance, such as gasoline, kerosene, butylene, etc. The tests showed no signs of a flammable element in the soil. However, these samples did have one aspect about them that the others didn't. All other samples had a wetness depth of 10 to 14 inches, while these had a wetness depth of no more than 4 inches. It was the opinion of the laboratory people that these samples were subjected to some kind of extreme heat. All water samples submitted for testing proved to be normal. Even the bacteriological analysis was normal. It was evident that the unknown craft had no effect on the water in the area. Analysis of the vegetation, insects and other samples submitted proved to be normal. Some of the grass samples showed signs of being burnt. No traces of a combustible substance were detected. Several samples of wilted vegetation proved to be caused by heat. Various insects, such as the Hymenoptera ant, were tested showing signs of exposure to heat and some being crushed. The sample of sap contained some sugar and other substances, but proved to be normal. As in the other tests, not one showed signs of being other than normal. Mr. C.H.'s veterinarian stated that he found nothing wrong with Mr. C.H.'s dog. The only thing that seemed a little out of the ordinary was the dogs eyes seemed to be \"running\" more than normal. Beyond that, he stated that the dog was in good health. Ron and I did character checks on the witnesses, especially Mr. C.H. All had very good reputations and were well respected in their communities. Mr. C.H. seemed to be an exceptional individual, who was always helping others. We talked to everyone from their neighbors to the local police. We found no reason not to accept what the witnesses thought they saw. An extensive search was made for additional witnesses, but no others were found. All police departments, airports, weather bureaus, gas and electric companies, military facilities, etc., were contacted for any possible additional information applicable to the case. We even did a complete follow-up report 30 days after the sighting. Again, nothing new was revealed. In conclusion, it is our opinion that some unknown craft did indeed land on the property of Mr. C.H. on the evening of April 10, 1983. None of us are claiming that the unknown craft was a flying saucer. There is no hard documented evidence to support that claim. Unless some important evidence should surface, we are listing this sighting and all the events involved, as simply an unknown. RICHARD H. HALL RESIGNS AS EDITOR It is with extreme regret that we have accepted the resignation of Richard H. Hall as Editor of the MUFON UFO Journal effective with the July issue. Mr. Hall is, without a doubt, one of the most qualified editors in the field of UFOlogy today. Dick became the editor with the January 1978 issue and has done a superb job for over five and one-half years. Professionally, he has had over 25 years experience as an editor-writer. Dick was Assistant Director of NIC AP (1958- 1967) and served as the International Coordinator of MUFON prior to assuming the position of editor. He was editor of NICAP's \"The UFO Evidence\" (1964) and a consultant to the University of Colorado UFO Project. Mr. Hall has continued to accept greater UFO responsibilities over the past years that have created burdens upon his professional and personal life. He will still devote a large amount of his personal time to UFO activities and responsibilities. Dick has agreed to write frequent articles for the Journal, therefore we will not be losing his talent and expertise. Walt Andrus, International Director will serve as the interim editor and work with Robert V. Pratt, the new editor, until the Journal is back on a current status. During the transition period, Mr. Hall will act as a consultant to the editors when his advice is sought. Mr. Pratt's mailing address is 4623 Holly Lake Drive, Lake Worth, FL 33463. A background resume on Bob Pratt .will be published in the September issue of the Journal. Bob has been a member of MUFON since 1976. We welcome him to his new responsibility as Editor of the Journal and a member of the MUFON Board of Directors. 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"AIR FORCE WARNS PILOT By Paul C. Ccrny (MUFON Western Regional Director) (Note: Originally reported in the NICAP U.F.O. Investigator, Mar.-Apr., 1965.) . On August 13,1959, a former Navy , pilot revealed an Air Force warning that he might become seriously ill after three • UFOs closely circled his plane. During an interview with an AF major at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico; strict secrecy was imposed on the pilot. Except for his wife, who had to be prepared if he were suddenly, stricken, he was ordered not to tell anyone about the encounter or the radiation hazard. Believing this possibly serious danger should not be hidden, the pilot, at that time, gave NICAP a signed confidential report, with sketches of the UFOs, a map of the sighting area, and confirmation of the secrecy order. The pilot, who served in the Navy in World War II, is now a service engineer for a large tool company. Flying a Cessna 170, enroute from Hobbs to Albuquerque, N.M., he was holding a course of 313 degrees, at 8,000 feet altitude. Suddenly he was amazed to see his Magnesyn electric compass revolving instead of indicating the course. Thinking the Magnesyn must be \"haywire,\" he looked at the standard magnetic compass. \"It was spinning so crazily I couldn't read it,\" the pilot reported. A moment later, he was startled to see three oval-shaped devices in close echebn formation pass directly in front of the Cessna. They were gray in color and identical in shape — like two bowls face to face (one inverted on the other) but with bottoms rounded instead of flat. The pilot estimated their diameter at about 8 feet, but they could have been considerably larger. Since the UFOs were circling the plane at nearly 250 m.p.h., no other details could be noted, except that they left a short, wispy trail. As the strange objects circled the 8 Illustration of Objects through the Windshield of a Cessna 170. (Malfunctioning Compasses) Cessna, the Magnesyn compass continued to revolve, precisely indicating the UFOs' bearing. Holding the same tight formation, the unknown devices finished another circle, passing in front and then disappearing to'the rear. The Magnesyn compass then came to rest near its original heading, and the standard magnetic compass finally stopped its \"crazy spinning\" and .returned to normal. The abnormal compass actions obviously were examples of the electromagnetic effect also reported by other responsible observers. Upon landing at the base, the pilot was \"hustled to an office and interrogated for about two hours by an AF major — the UFO Officer at the field.\" Then came the statement that \"raised the hair, on the back of his neck.\" The AF major told him that \"if anything unusual happened, or if he had any unusual illness in the next 6 months, to get to a government hospital right away ; \" The AF, the major said, would take care of him. Some years ago, Capt. E.J. Ruppelt, former Chief of Project Blue Book, confirmed that AF instrument- ation had recorded high radioactivity when UFOs passed over the test area. Also, several apparently genuine cases of illness,from UFO radiation are on record. In the case of the former Navy pilot, the fear injected by the Air Force warning kept him and his wife in a state of apprehension until 6 months had passed, and he decided the AF was wrong to conceal the facts. If a UFO-radiation hazard is known to exist, a nationwide warning should have been broadcast. Many planes have been circled or closely; approached by UFOs — military aircraft, private planes, and airliners. If this danger is real, then not only pilots and crews but hundreds .of airline passengers could be exposed. Since most airplane encounters are kept from, the public, crews and passengers would be unaware of their possible danger. Despite Capt. Ruppelt's admission, the AF still emphatically denies any proof of UFO radiation. The recent Texas Cash-Landrum case shows how this denial contradicts strong evidence."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"BOOK REVIEW UFOs: The Public Deceived By Philip J. Klass (Buffalo, NY: Prometheus Books, 1983) 310p. Having disposed of UFOs to his own satisfaction in previous books (UFOs: Identified, 1968; UFOs Explained, 1974), the author here sets out to explain why the \"myth\" persists. He finds a willful conspiracy by \"UFO promoters\" to deceive the public (for ill- defined reasons), aided and abetted by sensation-seeking news media. Although some worthwhile analysis and commentary is intermingled, the main thrust of the book is an assault on \"UFOlogists\" by name. Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Dr. Bruce S. Maccabee, and this reviewer come under personal attack, among others. For the most part, the author's selection of subject matter cannot be faulted: he focuses on highly publicized major cases and Government documents released under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), to which he gives his interpretation from the perspective of a high-profile skeptic. The interpretations sometimes add new insight on a given document or case, but more often reveal the mental processes of someone who believes (no doubt quite sincerely) that he already knows the truth. His discussions clearly demonstrate that he has done more than an average amount of research and personal investigation. This qualifies him as a \"UFOlogist.\" His misuse of logic and, yes, his deceptions, qualify him as a \"UFO demoter.\" The first five chapters are devoted to the question of Government secrecy/cover-up, including a detailed examination of the CIA documents and the agency's historical involvement in UFO investigation. Throughout, the author applies a simplistic logic, consisting of convenient assumptions (premises) and an either-or derivation of a \"reasonable\" negative conclusion. As an erstwhile formal student of logic, this reviewer is more amused than impressed by the child-like quality of the author's reasoning. The logic often takes this form: \"If it really were raining outside, mothers wouldn't let their children out in it; but since children were observed outside, it isn't raining.\" The author makes much out of the fact that there are not many CIA UFO documents for the time period involved (p. 14, for example), concluding that if UFOs were extraterrestrial there would be more documents. He also points to internal CIA statements skeptical about extraterrestrial UFOs. In regard to the former, if the CIA were to release its \"finished intelligence reports\" on specific UFO cases (which it has not done), we all would have a far more complete understanding of the CIA role in UFO investigations. The existence of these files is mentioned in several of the released documents, one of which is quoted by Klass (p. 35-36). They include cases requested from this reviewer, by the CIA. In regard to the latter, internal skeptical statements, this is not at all surprising in a highly compartmentalized intelligence agency. // UFOs were thought to be possibly extraterrestrial, a far more likely and \"reasonable\" interpretation is that the matter would be handled by a sub-group under deep cover, and every effort would be made to prevent public release of the \"finished intelligence reports.\" The author naively assumes that we have had access to all significant data, and that every action taken by the CIA has been open and above board. Witness, instead, the almost paranoid effort of the CIA (also documented by Klass) to conceal its very significant involvement in the Robertson Panel. Only a sustained, determined effort by \"UFO promoters\" forced this informa- tion into the public domain. It wasn't Klass or other skeptics who suspected * this and fought for the truth. But using the information we smoked but, he now claims that these documents reveal the \"whole truth.\" If he were really objective and seeking the full truth, he would advocate complete release of the \"finished intelligence files.\" After all these years, it is doubtful that any intelligence gathering methods would be compromised, and methods could be deleted where necessary. Somewhat more disturbing than his questionable logic and reasoning is clear evidence of one-sided, distorted reporting about the Robertson Panel (p. 28 et seq) and other subjects, which amounts to \"deception\" on his part. The 1950 Montana movie film, we are glibly assured, can be written off as aircraft on the basis of an authoritative pronouncement by the prestigious scientists. He fails to cite the congressional testimony of Dr. Robert M.L. Baker (House Science and Astronautics Committee hearings, July 29, 1968) based on extensive photoanalysis refuting this conclusion, or the Colorado Project report conclusion that \"...it strains credibility to suppose that these were airplanes.\" Klass resorts to authoritarian citing of the Robertson Panel as the final word when, as he well knows, the panel had very little time to do independent analysis and gave almost literally \"off- the-wall\" conclusions for complex cases. Klass also soothingly assures his readers that the 1952 Utah movie film was merely of seagulls; the Robertson Panel told us so. He does not cite the extensive analyses of the film by Air Force and Navy laboratories nor Dr. Baker's analysis excluding this possibility. Nor does he cite the testimony of Navy Chief Photographer Delbert Newhouse, who took the film, that the best close-up frames of the film, showing distinct disc-shaped objects, were missing when the film 'was returned to him. Could it be that those frames are in the \"finished inteligence report\" file of that case? As tempting as it is to confront the author with additional examples of omissions and distortions, a book review cannot be a thorough-going refutation. Four legal-sized yellow pad pages of notes must be condensed. There is some praise for chapters 8-11 on IFOs, a matter that most \"UFOlogists\" need a better education on, but hardly the ultimate answer.

Maccabee to appear in FATE this fall goes extensively into Klass' interpretations of many of the major cases and there is not space here to analyze each and every one. Chapters 16 & 17 on the 1973 Ohio Army' Helicopter Case provide an excellent example of the author's habit of quibbling over minor inconsistencies (whether quoted,from newspapers or more reliable sources), assuming all sorts of things without good reason, and trying to force a \"prosaic\" (fireball meteor) explanation on the case despite clear-cut evidence to the contrary.. \"Fireballs\" (relatively larger and longer-lasting meteors) have been studied and catalogued by this reviewer in consultation with the late Dr. Charles P. Olivier, original president of the American Meteor Society (AMS). It is not unusual for a \"fireball\" to last 15-20 seconds, approaching an upper limit at about 30 seconds. They do cause false UFO .reports, because of their large apparent size and the illusion of closeness, as if a plane crashing in a nearby field. Klass is forced to cope with the information that the UFO was visible for several minutes; one minute would be sufficient to rule out a \"fireball.\" He is also forced to skirt around other points .in Jennie Zeldman's excellent report on the case for the Center for UFO Studies, which he mentions. The UFO is reported to have nearly filled the helicopter windshield in apparent size at its closest point. \"Curiously,\" to borrow one of the author's favorite devices for influencing his reader, Klass insists that the UFO was a \"fireball\" despite there being no \"fireball\" reports for the night in question, as he was told by the current A.M.S. director. Curiously, he repeats an argument that he knows is false: that the green glow flooding the helicopter cockpit is attributable to the green-tinted upper portion of the windshield. Zeidman's report' includes testimony that the green glow also was visible through . white, untinted side windows. The conclusive factor is the apparent lack of any reported sightings from adjacent states, which is virtually 10 always the case with prominent \"fireball,\" and certainly with any \"fireball\" capable of producing the apparition observed by the helicopter crew. Klass cites the lateness of the hour, but that won't wash. \"Fireball\" catalogues include numerous multiT state observations at 11:00 p.m. or later. Unless , he can produce newspaper clippings (very common for \"fireball\" reports) or, better yet, an AMS summary report on the alleged October 18,' 1973 \"fireball,\" he should retract this explanation. Most unbecoming of all is the author's constant use of innuendo and ridicule where all else fails. \"Abduction\" and crash-retrieval reports are easy to ridicule, especially when one believes he already knows the answers. Apparently he does not recognize that scientific method requires open- minded and objective appraisal of controversial claims, not presumption of credulity on the part of those who deign to report such cases and try to analyze them .against the entire background of UFO reports. ' This reviewer is accused of \"hypercredulity\" (p. 273). On what basis? Klass favorably quotes an editorial enunciating Journal policy in reporting such cases, then notes my later editorial introduction to a report on the December 29, 1980 Cash- Landrum radiation injury case as being \"...one of the most significant reports in modern UFO history.\" Klass: \"Apparently, the possibility that this case might be a hoax did not occur to Hall, or it seemed too outlandish to even mention.\" In fact, I do reject a hoax explanation as quite out of the question, after careful consideration. Is he willing to state that the case is a hoax? Or only to insinuate-it, without the slightest evidence to offer? His tactics are worth noting: in one brief passage he attempts to discredit me as credulous (while performing a paranormal act of mind-reading), and to leave the impression the case is a hoax. Klass then proceeds to a sarcastic presentation of the \"...only alternative Hall can imagine,\" also alleging that there are no other radiation injury cases. In fact, there are many. This one happens to be one of the best documented, thanks to John Schuessler's thorough investigation. Contrary to what the author reports, the prior and subsequent health status of the principals has been and is being documented, in a caring way for the witnesses' well-being. Klass and his colleagues are miffed because MUFON investigators have refused to allow them access to this sensitive information. It has been and will be made known to proper authorities. Perhaps Klass might be invited to participate in more UFO conferences and programs (he bemoans the fact that he isn't throughout the book) if he indulged less in specious logic, distortion, and misrepresentation. No \"abductee\" has reported the incident to ;the FBI, therefore the reports are false (p. 275). Why haven't there been more UFO crashes since the Roswell incident, -and. if you believe there have been you are credulous, (p. 283-284). (Nothing like having it both ways!) Keyhoe and Hall at NICAP were too \"conservative\" so they were \"replaced\" by \"more 'UFOlogically conservative' Stuart Nixon\" (p. 284). The author's representation of what happened at NICAP is laughably inaccurate; this reviewer was not \"replaced\" against his will but resigned for totally personal reasons unrelated to UFO politics. Other events at NICAP also are interpreted, falsely, to fit the author's preconceptions. As \"UFO ,demoters\" go, the author is slick and persuasive-provided that the reader takes him at his word and is not ( well : versed in UFO literature. Although his sincerity is not questioned here, it is unfortunate that his style comes across as that of a skilled propagandist rather than a \"disinterested\" (in the scientific sense) observer of the scene, or even an openminded person who entertains the slightest doubt about his beliefs. His position is clear: UFOs are all nonsense, a pseudo-mystery artifically kept alive by \"UFO promoters\" who have some material or psychological stake in the controversy. It would appear to this observer that the author is hardly in a position to cast the first stone. — Richard Hall"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"PILOT SIGHTINGS AND RADAR TRACKINGS By Bob Gribble PART II The following reports were received at the National UFO Reporting Center. Each incident is published exactly as it was described by the witnesses. April 6, 1978 - Georgia — \"About 7:30 pm we were flying northbound in a Cessna over Savannah .Beach at 5500 feet. Radar told us we had Cessna traffic at our one o'clock position at 4500 and we told him we had him in sight. He passed on our right side a little below us. Just after he passed us we saw an-extremely fast moving red and white object eight or ten miles off of our one o'clock position, extremely fast and heading south the same direction the Cessna was heading. The fast movement caught our attention at first, then it started oscillating up and down; it looked like it would go up a thousand feet arid come down instantaneously two thousand feet, and it did this alternately.\" \"We told radar what we were looking at and he said he had nothing else on radar. We tracked this thing for about four minutes and it got behind us out of sight. The Cessna must have been following, the conversation because he reported he had an object off his nine o'clock position, right now. I had a passenger with me and he saw it. It oscillated up and down with such extremely high altitude changes, and so fast, that it could not have been an aircraft. We thought at first because of the speed it was traveling, that it was a meteor, but it was traveling on a horizontal plane. We were so awed by the abrupt altitude change of this thing that we just couldn't believe it.\" June 4, 1978 - California — \"I was flying in a Bonanza with my husband about 4500 feet and letting down over Pasadena at 1:30 pm when I saw a very strange object right in our windshield. It looked frosty, white, thick in the middle and it was tapered to both sides. It appeared to be round and I really thought it was going to crash right into our windshield. In the twinkle of an eye it went from a dead standstill to tremendous speed right up over trie top of our plane. My husband turned the aircraft around and there was absolutely nothing, the object was gone. From where I was sitting it just suddenly appeared. It appeared in the upper right quadrant of the windshield. It looked frosty and cold and big. It gathered tremendous speed instantly, raised itself up and went over our aircraft. It appeared as if I was looking at the edge of a plate. It did not have a reflective quality like something that was covered with metal. I think if it had not maneuvered to avoid us we would have hit it.\" • September 24,1978 — Maine — \"A police officer in Portland called me at about 9 pm and said he observed a large object in the sky.'It was cylindrical in shape and did riot have any lights on it. He asked me if I could verify it so I called radar. He got the radar \"up\" and he started picking up a target about 10,000 feet over Portland. The target remained on the screen for about 90 minutes. The police officer described the object as a grayish-pink in color, shaped like a bullet head, stationary most of the time, but when it did move, it moved at a high rate of speed and he could hear this humming sound. It had to be close to 60 feet in diameter.\" . November 15, 1978 — Eastern Washington State — \"We had four interceptors up and three of them saw a green object. The first sighting was at 13,000 feet and he was concerned it was another aircraft co-altitude with him. Later another interceptor had radar contact at 40 miles away and he was at 35,000 feet. We decided to let one of the interceptors go over and see if he could. get close to it and he descended to about 13,000 feet. He had radar contact at what he thought was about 15,000 feet. He got within eight miles of the object when he broke off because of very low fuel. He had radar contact, but his radar couldn't lock-on to it. He was • overtaking it by 400 knots at his speed so it appeared to be stationary. The pilot had visual contact with the object.\" December 1, 1978.— Southern California — \"My wingman and I were on maneuvers over the base about 6 pm. My wingman called on the radio and said he had a light he wanted me to look at that was staying at his three o'clock position. So we went down south. We saw a white light that looked about the size of a basketball. It had an irregular pulse to it. When I first saw it, it was at his three o'clock and my three o'clock and we were making pretty hard turns at about 160 knots. The thing moved down to his six o'clock and he says he sees it moving back to his five o'clock and I said no, it's back to your six. We made a couple turns then he picked one up on me; that I've got one that's now joining back at my four or five o'clock. I said I think it's the same one I'm looking at, but he's at your six o'clock. And then he says no, now he's moving to the top part of your aircraft, look above you, he's right above you. I looked up for just a second and I couldn't see it and I went back and picked up his object and I'm watching him. And then my aerial observer bent around in his seat and picked up two lights that were right above my tail about 40 feet. Then they separated and moved away. All this time the other light stayed right on my wingman's six o'clock, extended off at six, and closed off at six, and moving relative to our radius of turn. It's not like something that was fixed out there. Before I leveled my wings his light moved over his aricraft and moved right out in front of-him and was flying formation in front (continued on next page) 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Pilot Sightings, Continued of him. Then I left, and he left, and the light accelerated and moved out of sight. \"In this exercise we were working with the ground troops and they have forward air controllers. The controller that was listening on the radio stated that he could identify three other lights in this circle flying with me and this other guy. He saw that from the ground. I said what did they do? He said there was one that kind of stayed at six with one airplane and the other two were maneuvering in a circle and were above one aircraft for awhile. He said that when one of us departed they departed, one left the circle then the other two went right out after it, out of the circle and accelerated away and disappeared. I estimated we made about ten turns in a circle for about six or seven minutes.\" The pilot who reported this case said that during the flight the two aircraft flew over a well lighted area on the ground three times and, with each pass over the illuminated area he could see three circular objects silhouetted against the glow from the ground. The light following the other aircraft at the time was just a light, it had no body to it. May 26,1979 - Idaho — \"At 12:05 a.m. I was flying along at about 10,000 feet coming out of Blackfoot and approaching Hailey. I looked up in front of me and I saw these five orange objects in a horizontal formation in front of me, and then they tilted — like an airplane would dip its wings — and I thought it was some kind of aircraft. Then they spread out and I knew damn well it wasn't an aircraft. Then the objects regrouped and they got into a vertical line, then they just got all mixed up. I thought I was going to get run over. They looked like they were coming right at me — the distance was closing. Then they lengthened the distance from me out front, then they went over to my left and my magnetic compass started spinning and my ADF started spinning. At that point they were in a straight line formation and then they just blinked out. I feel I watched the objects for 15 minutes. I did have trouble receiving on the radio because 12 of heavy static and my engine started running rough.\" (During the entire period that the objects were observed by the pilot, unknown objects were tracked moving around the aircraft by surface radar.) \"I saw another object in 1973 while flying near Austin, Texas. A large orange object appeared to the right of my aircraft and it was coming at me at a tremendous rate of speed. I knew it was \"fixing\" to hit me. I did a maximum pull-up and I never did see it again.\" At 2:40 a.m. the crew of a Braniff airliner flying at 35,000 feet from Seattle to Fort Worth, Texas also observed the orange objects below their aircraft. The pilot of a private jet flying from Boise, Idaho to Salt Lake City, Utah, and located just ahead of the airliner, also observed the orange objects in the Hailey, Idaho area. As both aircraft reached a point about 50 miles southeast of Twin Falls, Idaho, the objects which were being tracked by radar over the Hailey area suddenly disappeared from the radar screen. At 2:53 am the Braniff airliner — which was now 70 miles northwest of Ogden, Utah — reported seeing the orange objects again at his one o'clock about 30 miles west of Ogden. At the same time, the objects were being tracked by radar at the same location given by the Braniff crew. The crews on Braniff and the smaller jet observed the objects until both aircraft were over Ogden, Utah. At about the same time the objects disappeared from the radar screen. June 9,1979 - California' \"I was flying toward Clear Lake from Marysville at 3:30 p.m. at 5000 feet and about five miles east of the south end of the lake. I observed a flashing object approaching me from the west on a collision course and it was closing-in extremely fast. I hardly had time to bank to avoid it and it hovered for a second off\" my left wingtip. The way it maneuvered gave me the feeling it could have avoided me anyway. It was about the size of a large truck tire inner tube that was covered with tiny mirrors. It was sort of sparkling and reflecting the sunlight. It hovered about 20 feet off of my wingtip for a second and then continued on its course. It was out of sight in a second. I first observed it approaching at approximately 20 miles distant and it closed on me in about 10 seconds.\" July 2, 1979 - Southeastern Nebraska — \"I just happened to walk into the radar room to make a standard check. I marked down a spot (on the scope) northwest of the station. The radar made another sweep and the blip moved again. The blip appeared two more times the same distance apart and I also marked them on the scope. It came down 305 degrees and the interesting thing is it headed right for the station and went over the station, whatever it was. I tried to pick it up going southeast of the station but nothing appeared. The distance between the blips were about the same, about 21 kilometers and I figured it was moving along about 2160 nautical miles per hour. I called another guy in who saw the last two blips. This happened at 9:15. p.m. All of the blips were very strong.\" July 5, 1979 - Gulf of Alaska — \"We were halibut fishing in the gulf south of Seward, Alaska about 2:45 a.m. when a super bright object came down thru the clouds and became stationary close to the water. At the same time a target appeared on our radar at about two miles distant — a really strong target. All of a sudden the radar heading was knocked off of its setting and one of the crew had to reset it. That just never happens. It was a bright glowing object with a bowl-like shape. It faded out and simultaneously disappeared from the radar screen, then reappeared visually and on radar. The radar heading was knocked off when the object approached the boat. The object was only a couple feet off the wafer. The incident lasted for about five minutes and the radar was picking up a strong signal.\" September 10,1979-Oregon— \"There were two of us flying ten miles north of Myrtle Creek at 5000 feet at about 12:45 p.m. in an Aztec and about a half mile off formation with a Cessna 182, which was a brand new airplane. We were just getting ready to let down at Myrtle Creek when this thing came from about a four o'clock possition"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"from the coast and looked - when it was facing me - like the round fuselage of an airliner with a reflection in front, but not on the sides. Then it moved in behind the Cessna, • several hundred . feet behind and below him. Then it started moving directly toward the Cessna and I called him. He told me later that all he got was the word plane. I was trying to tell him there was a plane coming up on him. He said he looked around on both sides and couldn't see anything. After that he couldn't hear any of my conversation. I tried him on two different transmitters and all he could hear. was static while the object was around. After the thing left he could hear me. It moved underneath him, several hundred feet below him, then it lifted up vertically to pretty close underneath him — within 25 feet I suppose, — and hung there for a minute. I tried to call him again. I would say the object was probably 30 feet in diameter and shaped like a sphere. There was nothing sticking out from it and it was metal. Then it dropped back down and slid back behind him. And then it pulled up underneath him again, but not so close this time. It moved off to'theright at about four or five o'clock position and,dropped down over the coast mountain range. The whole observation lasted for about five minutes.\" November 11, 1979 - North Carolina ^- \"I was flying a Lear jet from Newport News; Virginia to Houston, Texas at 6:25 p.m. and had just leveled off at 41,000 feet. We were just coming up on Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina when radar called us and wanted to know if we had a target at 12 o'clock. My co-pilot and I did make contact with a white object about six minutes before the call. Radar said the target was at, about ten miles; that it was an unreported target and that no aircraft were in the area. We had the object in sight for about ten minutes. It stayed in front of us until radar started talking to us and then it went from our 12 o'clock position to our two o'clock position rather rapidly; faster than any airplane that I have ever seen. And then all of a sudden it went straight up. It got to within about four miles of us before ascending. During this time a Delta flight came in and they spotted it. There was another Lear jet that also saw the object. It ascended to about 65,000 feet and moved along with us for a while. Then it'turned around and went like a streak of lightning northeast, like it was going after another aircraft. We just watched it go and vanish. Radar continued to track the object until it streaked away.\" December 29, 1979 - Northern Illinois — \"We had a call from the Sheriffs department at 11 p.m. and they said they were looking at a UFO. We looked on the radar and observed the target in that area westbound, very fast. There were three controllers and myself. We watched the target and it stopped, changed direction to a north heading, went north for about three miles, stopped again, went southwest for five miles, stopped again, went westbound right up to the Mississippi .River, stopped there, then continued westbound. It covered 54 miles in three- and-one-half minutes, plus it stopped four times. We were receiving a strong return. There were no known aircraft in the area. I have never seen an aircraft at that speed turn that fast. The stops were very .abrupt arid the turns were very abrupt. I don't know of any airplane that can turn that fast. We picked up a second object at 11:04 p.m. and it proceeded southwest until it was diretly over the Mississippi River at which time it turned southbound and. paralleled right over the river for about half-a-mile and moved away to the west- southwest. After we picked up the second object I checked back with the Sheriffs department and was advised that they had observed another object.

This situation lends itself very conveniently to a policy of official coverup of the UFO topic, and also allows for such biased presentations of the subject as the recent \"NOVA\" program to be unwittingly swallowed by a public ignorant of the facts regarding UFOs. No amount of irate letters to WGBH or BBC, and no amount of editorializing within the community of UFOlogists will do one iota to change this situation. However, there is a mechanism to prevent future media disasters such as the infamous \"NOVA\" program, and also to make the coverup of the subject of UFOs virtually ineffective. This mechanism will hopefully also result in the eventual pooling of our national resources and brainpower to solve the mystery of this vital enigma. The mechanism to which I refer is a massive, nationwide public information and public education effort on our part. An informed citizenry will not accept a biased, one-sided presentation of the subject by the media. An informed public would not be deceived so easily by a coverup of the subject, and an informed public would certainly expect, and perhaps, demand, of the news media, a thorough, accurate current coverage of such newsworthy UFO events as the 1980 UFO landings at Kirtland AFB. There may be something to be said for the idea that ignorance is bliss, but conversely, there is much to be argued for the public's right to know the facts. Hopefully most serious UFOlogists 14 would agree with the latter. If you consider yourself to be in this category, we would like you to ask yourself the following ten questions: 1. What have you done to educate or inform the public in your community about the UFO phenomenon? 2. When approached to lecture on the subject, do you accept, or do you rely on someone else to do it? 3. Do any colleges or adult education programs in your community offer any courses for adults on the UFO phenomenon? If not, have you done anything to change that situation? 4. Have any of the MUFON members in your state ever offered a children's course on UFOs? (Programs for academically gifted and talented are particularly , appropriate for this type of course.) 5. How well informed are the local and state police officers in your state with regard to the UFO subject and. with regard to what to do when sightings are reported to them? 6. Has your state organization done anything to ensure that the police are informed with regard to these things? 7. Have you sought out credible, responsible radio and television talk show hosts in your state and offered to appear on their programs? 8. Have you established contacts with responsible newspaper reporters in your area and made them aware of the seriousness of the UFO subject? 9. Has your group ever provided an exhibit or display for a shopping mall, country fair, or other public function involving large numbers of visitors? 10. Most important, are your members well informed on the subject of UFOs, and do you keep up to date with the latest research, new cases, government document releases, UFO news, events, etc.? If you and your state MUFON group cannot answer affirmatively to all of these questions, we would encourage you to address those with negative answers over the next few months and attempt to achieve affirmative responses to them. Should you need help with any of these endeavors, contact Marge Ghristen- sen, 2 Cherry Road, Beverly, MA 01915. A course syllabus is available for both an adult UFO course and also a UFO course for academically gifted and talented children. Public information should be every UFOlogist's business. .UFOlpgy is not merely a fun hobby. It involves a serious pursuit of complex answers to the very complex UFO phenomenon. In a sense, we are the fortunate few who have had the luxury of diverting our attention from life's everyday struggles, and have been privileged to study this vital and fascinating subject, which will someday undoubtedly impact life on this planet in ways we can now only dimly perceive. Together with that privilege goes a responsibility — that of educating the public as to the UFO reality. Education is the best method of combatting ignorance, and in this case, it would also seem to be the most effective method of ensuring that biased journalistic presentations on the subject of UFOs as well as policy of cover-up of the subject are ineffective. This will not happen overnight. We have a lengthy and monumental task ahead of us. Let's get started!

Larry and A.E. \"Mark\" Candusso have been Co-Chairmen of the Flying Saucer Investigative Committee (FSIC) since 1961. On October 15, 1970, Mr. Moyers was appointed MUFON State Director for Ohio. He was the Host Chairman for the MUFON 1974 UFO Symposium in Akron, Ohio on June 22 and.23 at the Downtown Holiday Inn - Cascade. He had recently retired from Akron Rubber Company and was now able to devote time to his favorite hobbies — UFOs and travel. Larry and hisparehts have traveled extensively in North and Central America. ; We. offer our condolences to Larry's parents who survive him. His colleagues in UFOlogy mourn the passing of one of the pioneers in this intriguing study. LETTERS A distortion of fact seems to have invaded the pages of the Journal regarding the subject of UFOs. Hynek provided a widely accepted definition concerning observations that remain ..unexplained after .competent Mrs. Mildred Biesele, State Director for Utah and Contributing Editor investigation. He also developed a logical and useful breakdown of UFO sightings that has been adopted worldwide. The categories are NL, DD, RV, CE 1, 2, and 3. (Anyone puzzled by this abbreviated notation should see his book, The UFO Experience, Part H, Regnery, 1972.) The first category of noctural lights (NL) is by far the least significant source of information about UFOs being, in fact, nearly inconsequential. To equate strange lights in the sky with the full range of UFO observations included in the other categories is a gross error. It can seriously mislead people who have only a limited.knowledge of the subject. Michael A. Persinger has been undertaking some productive research regarding the formation of points of light that are alleged to be statistically related to earthquakes and appear to be associated with electromagnetic conditions of rocks under great stress. (See Haines, Richard F., UFO Phenomena and the Behauorial Scientist, Chapter 13, Scarecrow Press, 1979.) However, Persinger unsuccessfully attempts to utilize his \"...unspecified, infrequent, natural terrestrial process...\" to explain the entire gamut of UFO phenomena while endorsing the scientific principles of such leading UFO investigators as Menzel and Klass. This leap of faith requires that at least 90% of the UFO data be ignored or, in some instances, attributed to magical properties of EM fields to deceive the witnesses for which there is not a shred of evidence. It totally ignores such things as large, unknown craft standing on highways, physical evidence at landing sites, aircraft encounters lasting tens of minutes and even hours, declassified government documents describing strange aircraft, still photographs, movie footages, etc. Need I go on? In addition to a regular Critics Corner, our esteemed in-house skeptic, Robert Wanderer, captured 214 pages in the June issue espousing and defending Persinger's explanation of UFOs. It appears that these two prolific authors (a) are not well informed about UFOs, (b) purposefully reject the data that does not fit their mental bent, or (c) intentionally try to misdirect the reader's attention from the reality of UFOs as defined by the full extent of human experience with them.

A letter was mailed to all Frontiers of Science subscribers in January 1983 advising them of the \"bad news\" and that they had a choice of four different publications, who were willing to substitute the remaining issues of their subscription. These magazines were FATE, BIBLICAL ARCHEOLO- GY REVIEW, BRAIN/MIND BULLETIN and the MUFON UFO JOURNAL. This choice would be valid only if the subscriber was not already subscribing to the MUFON UFO JOURNAL, as an example. It could not be used to simply extend present Journal subscribers, since the major reason for making this generous offer was to give more people an opportunity to read and evaluate the MUFON UFO JOURNAL as potential subscribers/ members. Over seven hundred people selected the MUFON UFO JOURNAL as their choice and so advised the former publishers of Frontiers of Science during the intervening months. Due to neglegence or poor communications on the part of the former publisher, MUFON did not receive the list of people desiring to receive the Journal until August 2, 1983. This delay, plus our own editorial problems, has created an embarrassing situation for both the Frontiers of Science and MUFON. The June issue of the Journal was the first edition to be mailed to former subscribers on an issue for issue basis. The majority of 16 these people had only two or three issues to go to complete their subscriptions. A Journal renewal form is being enclosed with the last issue to each subscriber, inviting them to join the fastest growing UFO investigative organization in the World and to subscribe to the MUFON UFO JOURNAL.

Schuessler UFO organizations, large and small, are feeling the pressures of public apathy and the confusion caused by the dissemination of incorrect information by the media. After the fact complaining is of little value — the harm has been done. A better approach is for organizational representatives to reach the public with a fairly constant flow of honest and exacting data, presented in a manner pleasing to the audience. The easiest way to reach the public is to give speeches in your local community.' Schools, service organizations, clubs, and churches are always in need of speakers for their programs. In approaching the schools the speaker must exercise care to present facts, pro and con, and not try to push one biased'viewpoint, only. The gifted children classes in grade schools often examine .futuristic and far reaching issues. These young poeple are : alert, inquisitive, and well read, and consequently, are often critical of the material being presented. They offer a refreshing challenge to the speaker. High school., science, literature, and psychology classes need speakers that will address very specific issues, such as \"are ' UFOs a product of the imagination?\", or. \"is interstellar travel possible?\", School presentations are usually limited to about 45 minutes; but sometimes classes will combine to provide an hour and a half intensive session. Service organizations and clubs provide speaking opportunities that fall into the entertainment category. The speaker must .be prepared for presentation ranging from a 30-minute informative breakfast or luncheon talk to a longer illustrated evening keynote speaker address. Audiences are usually cordial, wanting new information, or. an opportunity to share an experience with the speaker. It is wise to allow a portion of the allotted speaking time for audience questions. The local media outlets provide a wide variety of public relations opportunities. A good starting place is the letters to the editor column in the local newspaper. Clear, concise, and factual letters written in a responsible manner will usually be printed if space permits, unless the editor has a bias against the subject matter. Human interest stories about investigators, researchers, their families, and the results of their work are welcomed by columnists. Local newspapers generally want stories.of local interest, not • international in .scope unless the local people are directly involved. Radio and television programs provide exposure to a large, arid varied audience, but the opportunities are limited. Talk shows 1 are constantly in need of guests. For maximizing the talk show opportunity, it is best to become familiar with the personality of the show and the host before appearing. Some talk show hosts pride themselves on being able to stimulate controversy, 'while others try to provide a more conservative information-based program. Talk shows tend to put the guest on the firing line, so be prepared for \"surprises'\" Local UFO groups can get public exposure, while serving the community, by participating in United Way activities, fund raising telethons, blood donor drives, and charity fun runs. Qualified • individuals may be selected to serve on boards and committees as well as participating in the events. Most communitites have parades to commemorate special events. A tastefully designed float or decorated van can raise public awareness about your organization. The cost can be held to a reasonable level and your group can enjoy participating. Public service bulletin boards can • be found in supermarkets, restaurants, bowling alleys, and a host of other locations. A small business card suggesting a number to call to report a UFO or to receive inforrhation is best. Large announcements use too much space and are pulled down in a few. days, whereas business cards often survive for months. A \"UFO ALERT CARD\" can be valuable in . community communi- cations. The information content should be kept to a minimum. A 3 x 5 card printed on colored stock, containing the letters \"UFO\" and a local telephone number in large print is most effective. The card should also contain the organization name and mailing address. Long .statements of policy or fact should be avoided. These cards can be mailed to radio and television stations, airports, police agencies, city and county government offices, political office holders, and posted on bulletin'boards. If the organization can provide a variety of speakers; .it would be worthwhile to announce a speakers' bureau and provide a listing of available topics. The bureau can be advertised through newspaper articles and by mailing announcements to' local organizations.   '. . Several researchers have developed and taught special courses at local colleges 'and trade schools. Courses range from, a two or three session overview to an intensive 12 to 16 week series. Such courses are rewarding, but are time consuming and require 1 a lot of dedication on the part of the researcher. . It is beneficial to the health of the organization to communicate with the public. It should be stressed, however, that the highest level of credibility and professionalism should .be maintained at all times. Then, the possibilities are as unlimited as the imagination. 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Director's Message, from p. 20 submitted oral reports at the Annual Corporate Meeting: Marge Christen- sen, Massachusetts; Doug Labat, Louisiana; John Magor, British Columbia; Mildred t Biesele, Utah; Michael Brein, Hawaii; Don Johnson, Washington; Paul B. Norman, Victoria, Australia; Neal Hern, Texas; Bill Hassel, So. California; Forrest Lundberg, Iowa; Jean Waller, Oklahoma; Paul C. Cerny, No. California; and Steve Toth for Ohio in the absence of Larry Moyers. Based upon the positive contributions made, and the enthusiasm of the participants, this was undoubtedly our most constructive and successful corporate meeting. Mr. Milton W. Hourcade, a journalist who holds a Masters Degree in Theology, has been appointed Representative for Uruguay. Living in Montevideo, Mr. Hourcade founded Centre de Investigacion de Objetos Voladores Inidentificados (CIOVI) twenty-five years ago. As a corresponding member, Milton will provide periodic information and UFO cases from Uruguay. We are proud to announce the promotion of two members to State Director who represented their respective states at Pasadena. Mrs. Jean Waller, former Assistant State Director, is now State Director for Oklahoma replacing William L. Irby. Jean resides at 636 East Rock Creek Road, Norman, OK 73071. Mr. Donald A. Johnson, a former State Section Director for the counties surrounding Pudget Sound, has accepted the position of State Director for Washington, relieving Robert J. Gribble of that responsibility. Bob will devote his time to the operation of the National UFO Reporting Center, telephone 1-206-722-3000 and continue on the MUFON Staff - UFO Hotline. By concentrating his efforts on his prime project, Bob feels that he can contribute more to Ufology in this capacity. After many years of semi- retirement from the field of ufology, John S. Weigle has volunteered his talent as the State Section Director for Ventura County in California. . A 18 journalist by profession, he was the editor of the Ventura UFO Study Group Newsletter from its inception in January 1957 to. the 21.page issue of April 1961 signaling its demise. John was publishing the \"Ufology Bulletin\" (name revision) while he was attending college to earn a B.A. in Journalism. Since the Ventura UFO Study Group was associated with NICAP during this era, both Major Donald Key hoe and Richard H. Hall would enjoy reminiscing, as I did, by reading back issues of the Ufology Bulletin. We welcome Hobard Gregory Baker of Orient, Ohio as a new Research Specialist in Immunology. Mr. Baker earned a B.S. in physiology from Ohio State University and is employed as a immunochemistry editor.

Since the Journal has a policy of not accepting advertising, we prefer to inform our readers about new books, authored by members, through the Director's Message. John Paul Oswald has published a small booklet (59 pages) entitled \"What You Need To Know.\" It is a condensed and simplified form containing all the main features of his long, comprehensive and sophisticated analysis of his thesis on the UFO phenomenon entitled \"UFOs and a Coherent World-view\" (copy in MUFON file). This thought provoking •booklet may be obtained from John by sending $3.00 to P.O. Box 652, Hampton, NH 03842..

Such a system could decrease the delay between the time that a report is received by a UFO report collection agency (e.g., a UFO group headquarters) and the time that a field investigator finds out about the report. An important consideration in such a system is the number of individuals who could use it. We therefore request that those people who have a computer and modem would be so kind as to send us a postcard or letter with a brief description of their computer system and whether or not they would be interested in a network. (Send to Fund for UFO Research, Box 277, Mt. Rainier, MD 20722). Director Message, Continued classification for one of the most significant UFO books to be published due to disclosures made in documents released under the Freedom of Information Act. Scheduled for release during the Spring of 1984 by Prentice- Hall (New York), the book entitled \"Clear Intent\" co-authored by Lawrence Fawcett and Barry J. Greenwood is anticipated to blow the secrecy lid off the Pentagon. Mr. Fawcett is the Assistant State Director for Connecticut and Mr. Greenwood is a State Section Director in Massachusetts.

Haines, Ph.D., Director North America UFO Federation 1 UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE The UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE will keep you informed of all the latest United States and World-Wide UFO activity, as it happens! Our service was started in 1969, at which time we contracted with a reputable international newspaper-clipping bureau to obtain for us, those hard to find UFO reports (i.e., little known photographic cases, close encounter and landing reports, occupant cases) and all other UFO reports, many of which are carried only in small town or foreign newspapers. \"Our UFO Newsclipping Service issues are 20-page monthly reports, reproduced by photo-offset, containingJbe latest United States and Canadian UFO newsclippings, with our foreign section carrying the latest British, Australian, New Zealand and other foreign press reports. Also included is a 3-5 page section of \"Fortean\" clippings (i.e. Bigfoot and other \"monster\" reports). Let us keep you informed of the latest happenings in the UFO and Fortean fields.\" For subscription information and sample pages from our service, write today to: UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE Route 1 — Box 220 Plumerville, Arkansas 72127 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE Since many of our members were unable to attend the MUFON annual Corporate Meeting on July 3, 1983 at the Huntington-Sheraton Hotel in Pasadena, California, some of the highlights and points of business will be briefly reviewed. The following officers were reelected for 1983-84: Walter H. Andrus, Jr., International Director; John F. Schuessler, Deputy Director of Administration; Thomas H. Nicholl, Deputy Director for Business Management; Sam Gross, Corporate Secretary and John Donegan, Treasurer. The four Regional Directors on the Board of Directors were reelected to another term. They are Paul C. Cerny (Western Region), Charles L. Tucker (Central Region), Joseph Santangelo (Eastern Region) and Henry H. McKay (Canada). A special report was presented by Richard F. Haines, Ph.D., newly elected Director of the North American UFO Federation (NAUFOF), in which he announced the names of the other officers elected by the Board. They were Henry H. McKay, Deputy Director; Peter Mazzola, Secretary; and Ann Druffel, Treasurer. Dr. Haines proposed both long and short range goals and objectives for the Federation. Dick has been vitally interested in cooperation between UFO organizations in the United States, having prepared and introduced a formal resolution at the Ft. Smith UFO Conference on October 17-19, 1975 titled \"A Joint Resolution.\" The theme for this Conference, coordinated by Bill Pitts, was \"UFO - United for Objectivity.\" Both Dick Haines and Bill Pitts have seen their dream become a reality. The other members of the NAUFOF Board of Directors are Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Rick R. Hilberg, Charles J. Wilhelm, Richard H. Hall and Walter Andrus. NAUFOF Director, Richard Haines has ordered stationery for the new organization, however a contest will be conducted to design an appropriate logo that may be used on future stationery, envelopes, membership cards, etc. Please submit your artwork to Richard Haines, 325 Langton Ave., Los Altos, CA 94022. The Board of Directors will approve the design and award recognition to the contest winner. All entries must be received prior to December 31, 1983. James M. McCampbell, Director for Research, initiated a new innovation at the corporate meeting by making a Director's Report of his duties, responsibilities, goals, and elaborated upon the work accomplished through the MUFON Consultants and Research Specialists, which he coordinated during the past year. We hope to have a separate article in the Journal detailing his advisory board's achievements. Jim has invited other Board of Directors of the functional departments to utilize this medium (Corporate Meeting and Journal) to share their work with MUFON members. Following Dr. Haines announce- ments about the NAUFOF, William L. Moore was invited to make a statement concerning the current feelings of the Board of Directors of the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO) as it related to becoming a partner in the Federation. He advised that APRO wanted to continue to operate independently and would be watching the progress of the NAUFOF. Bill is a member of the APRO Board and a MUFON State Section Director in Arizona. Mrs. Marge Christensen presented both a verbal and written report on the activities of the Committee on Public Information and Education, composed of Walter Webb, Barry Greenwood, and Jean Thompson. In addition to supplying pertinent newsworthy UFO sightings released under the Freedom of Information ACT (FOIA), that resulted in a MUFON UPI story covering North America, and an AP article that saturated Texas news media, they have conducted numerous public relation events in Massachusetts. This committee was also responsible for generating a \"TELUFONET\" in which the International Director in Seguin, Texas is enabled to contact all U.S. State Directors within an hour's time in the event of an important media event or news development. This sequential telephone list will be up-dated at regular intervals to keep it current, since it would be ineffective if the telephone call sequence was broken. Joe Santangelo gave an update on the MUFON Amateur Radio Net which meets every Saturday morning on 7237 KHz at 8:00 AM Eastern Time (7:00 AM Central) by providing a list of the stations reporting in to the net from January 2, 1983 thru April 9th, utilizing his home computer word processor. A revision was made in the method by which MUFON will cooperate with the Center for UFO Studies when CUFOS does not have an investigator in the locale of the sighting. It will be forwarded by Dr. Hynek to Seguin, Texas for assignment to the appropriate State or State Section Director. (A separate article in the Journal provides the revised procedure. The third edition of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual Section XVIII, Interface with the Center for UFO Studies, page 143 will be revised accordingly.) G. Neal Hern, Chairman, announced that the MUFON 1984 UFO Symposium will be held June 8,9, and 10 at the Northpark Inn in Dallas, Texas, hosted by MUFON Metroplex. MUFON of North Carolina has expressed a serious interest in hosting the 1985 event in Winston-Salem. No decision has been reached. All Journal readers and MUFON members are invited and encouraged to express themselves on the material content that they would like to see in our monthly magazine. We are looking for constructive criticism so as to improve the caliber of our magazine as proposed by Richard Hall. We have received many fine suggestions and good recommendations. We solicit your contributions, since it is your magazine. The following State Directors (continued on page 18)"}]
