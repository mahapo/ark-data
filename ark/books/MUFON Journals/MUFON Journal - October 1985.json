Scott Grain On the evening of October 15, 1983, 67-year-old Catherine Burk was driving home to Bellwood from Altoona, Pennsylvania after a visit with her family. While traveling north on Route 220, she noticed a bright object in the sky out the passenger side window. As it hovered closer, she could see it was a bright, silvery disc, about 24 feet in diameter, moving in a flight path directly above her car. The disc wasn't more than 30 feet off the ground and was emitting a sharp, fast hum. Suddenly, as the UFO passed overhead, the passenger side of her 1976 Chevrolet Malibu was lifted up on two wheels, approximately three feet above the road. The left side of her.car remained in the air for almost three seconds before the UFO moved away, dropping her car back on the road with a bounce. \"I couldn't get control of the car. I was sliding over the seat,\" Mrs. Burk said. She was flung under the dash when her car came down. When she finally regained control of the vehicle, she pulled off the road. The UFO continued its flight in a northwesterly direction and disappeared behind a ridge. It took 20 to 25 minutes for Mrs. Burk to restart the car, and it shut off several times on her trip home. SOBER Bellwood Police Chief Gregory Ciaccio investigated and found Mrs. Burk \"visibly shaking\" and \"...was not drinking. The witness appeared to me to be sincere and honest, and not one to concoct a story such as this.\" As a result of Mrs. Burk being jarred in her car, she has been treated at Mercy Hospital in Altoona for a number of physical injuries. These include a neck brace she was still wearing three weeks after the incident, a bruised shoulder, spinal problems, possible chest injuries and a loss of hearing in the right ear. Mrs. Burk wants to put this experience behind her. The irony of this incident is that what happened to Catherine Burk will probably happen again. A number of reports are on file where UFOs have exerted an uplifting force on motor vehicles as well as other objects. A government topographer experienced a similar episode while driving on the Andean Highway between La Victoria and El. Vigia, Venezuela on January 1, 1961. The details of the incident were recorded in the September 1961 issue of the APRO Bulletin in which Horacio Gonzales' account of what happened appeared in the lead article, \"Disc Upsets Truck.\" \"Mr. Paolini pulled off to the extreme right of the road and the truck passed on towards the front. In this position both vehicles continued for a few minutes when, suddenly like a bolt from the blue, a brilliant object in the shape of a metallic disk, looking as though made from polished blue steel, swooped down from the sky at incredible speed and crossed perilously close over the front end (hood) of the truck. It then rose immediately in soaring flight at the same fantastic speed and was lost to sight in space in a matter of seconds in the opposite side of the sky. When the discoidal object rose into the air above the hood of the truck, the vehicle also rose a few feet into the air and overturned in the direction taken by the object — fortunately into a sand-bank at the side of road — with its four wheels upturned in the air. Controlling the fear and astonish- ment which seized him, Mr. Pisani stopped the jeep and rushed to assist the occupants of the truck. Luckily, the driver was the only occupant and escaped with only a few scratches, bumps, minor cuts and nervous shock. They then both went in search of other T. Scott Grain people to help right the truck and get it back into operation.\" TORQUE In some cases, as in the previous one, UFOs cannot only lift a vehicle off the road, but also impart a torque, or turning force, to an object in the same direction the UFO leaves the scene. A splendid example illustrating this type of manuever is reported on page 50 of the NICAP book Strange Effects From UFOs by Gordon Lore. According to Lore: \"It was 11:45 p.m., December 20, 1965. Edward. A. Bruns was driving his father's 1962 Ford pick- up truck home. As he was heading west, south of Route 27, near Herman, Minnesota, he saw a bright, oval-shaped object hovering several feet above the road. The large UFO 'covered the entire road' and was shaped like two saucers with a dome on top. A (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"UFO LIFTING POWER, continued window-like structure surrounded • the dome. A green light was emitted from the window. Suddenly, the truck engine stopped, the headlights went out, and the vehicle was spun violently to the right.\" When the vehicle finally coasted to a stop, the truck was on the south side of the road, now facing east, resting in a ditch. According to Lore's report, Bruns watched the UFO emit sparks from its under-carriage, ascend and disappear. The human.body is not immune to • the forces that some UFOs exert. On October ,8, 1954, a resident of Teheran testified he was on the second floor of his house when he saw a glowing, white object stop, in mid-air 60 feet away. \"I was \"standing with both'hands on the bar of my, balcony, when I suddenly felt as though I were being drawn up toward the .object by a magnet,\" reported Ghaseme Fili, of Amireah Street. Fili screamed in terror at the odd sensation The UFO shot up vertically, 1 emitting sparks, and vanished into the air. Another • extraordinary case occurred on March 8, 1967 to Mr. and Mrs. William L. Wallace while they were driving home to Leominster, Massachusetts. 'Shortly after midnight, the Wallace's noticed a large bright glow hovering about 400 to 500 feet above St. Leo's Cemetery, so they investigated. Again, Lore writes: \"Wallace told Raymond E. Fowler, of NICAP's Massachu- setts, Subcommittee, that he stopped his car, placed it in neutral gear and put the emergency brake on, with the motor still running. He lowered the windows. Then he got out and pointed toward the UFO. As he did so, his arm was pulled abruptly against the roof of the automobile. His car then stalled; the headlights went out and the radio ceased playing. \"I was unable to move,\" he said. \"My wife was in panic. My mind was not at all affected. (I) just could not move, felt like shock or numbness.\" \"When the car went dead,\" Mrs. Wallace stated, .\"I was yelling for Bill to get back into the car, but he did not move from where he was standing. I then slid across the seat and reached for him.\" \"Mrs. Wallace grabbed her husband's jacket, but the startled witness, who has a reputation for being fearless, did not move. Wallace reported that he was in this immobile state for more than 30 seconds. Then he noticed that the lights and radio came back on. The UFO, which, by then, was rocking back and forth, sped upward and disappeared, emitting a humming sound.\" CANADIAN CASE A UFO kidnapping was averted in an incident in Thompson, Manitoba, Canada in June, 1967. It was 6:00 p.m.; it lasted only three or four minutes, and was observed by Mr. and Mrs. D.F. LeMarquands, three of their children, two other children, and four neighbors. Details of the encounter appeared in a Canadian UFO publication, Saucers, Space and Science (number 52, 1968), edited by Gene Duplantier. Duplantier reports: \"Mrs. LeMarquands had just entered the house when she heard a beeping noise at about one second intervals. Looking out the window, she saw dirt and debris moving rapidly around the house in a circular pattern. Upon going outside, she saw her husband who had just driven into the yard. He and the five children were staring up into the sky. At first only dust and dirt, moving in a vortex could be seen, but then Mrs. LeMarquands was able to see the object causing the disturbance. She described the object as being large and shaped much like a pack of cigarettes although she later commented that it might have been cube-shaped. It was revolving counterclockwise and appeared to have alternative shiny aluminum and then black sides as it moved. It had no apparent openings or lights, and it was dead silent. As she watched the object, Mrs. LeMarquands was distracted by a scuffing sound and she looked to the ground to see a 13-year-old boy from across the street pinning down her 8-year-old daughter. At this time the object started moving off at a 45-degree angle, leveled off, hovered, and then left on a level course toward the southeast. Mrs. LeMarquands' attention was then drawn toward the children, all of whom were visibly shaken, except her 8-year-old daughter. The whirlwind had stopped and the little girl was not standing by herself. The other children were eventually sufficiently calm in order to say that their 8-year-old playmate had risen into the air toward the slowly revolving object. The 13-year-old boy had grabbed her when she was about three feet off the ground. The children reported that the little girl's skirt, blouse, and hair had ridden straight up her body when she was rising. When asked if she could remember anything, the girl replied that she could remember nothing from the instant the wind started until she stood up.\" ANIMALS, TOO Animals have not been excluded from the uplifting forces of UFOs. In his book, Ufohgy—New Insights From Science and Common Sense, James McCampbell writes: \"A Frenchman remained outside the hazardous zone although his horse did not. He was leading his mare with a bridle when a UFO took off from the side of the road and flew overhead. The mare rose about 3 meters into the air and the witness had to release the bridle.. After falling back to the ground, the animal could not move for about 10 minutes.\" What is the significance of these kinds of UFO reports? Are the UFO operators purposely executing unusual physcial encounters on mankind or do they happen merely as a result of vehicles, animals and people coming too close to a UFO's propulsion system? Of course, we don't know the . (continued on page 16)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"UFO INFORMATION WEEK By Marge Christensen Thomas Jefferson once said, \"Ignorance is preferable to error; and he is less remote from truth who believes nothing, than he who believes what is wrong.\" Anyone who has done any public information on the UFO subject knows just how valid this statement is. If the general public were merely ignorant of the documented evidence and data on the UFO subject, the situation would not be nearly so difficult to correct. However, thanks to the tabloids working overtime to promote wild, sensational UFO-related stories with absurd, screaming headlines attracting the eye of just about every person in the country who ever shops at a supermarket, our job is that much more difficult. The bottom line is that the public is not uninformed; it is severly misinformed. MISINFORMED Every one of us who has presented UFO lectures to civic organizations has had to deal with such misconceptions as: \"If UFOs are being sighted everywhere, why are there no photographs of them? Why are they only sighted in deserted rural areas? Why have no pilots or astronauts ever reported UFO sightings?\" It became even more graphically evident to me just how misinformed the public is when I was recently asked by a professional person with a college degree if I thought that perhaps the \"aliens\" had brought the disease AIDS here in order to force humans to behave better! It is this misinformation that largely contributes to the stigma which has come to be attached to the UFO subject. One can hardly blame the average person for being somewhat hesitant to put his/her name on the dotted line of a membership application in a UFO research organization, if his only exposure to the subject has been provided by the media, and mainly by the sensational-type articles. UFO Week Not Just Hot Air With all of this information in mind, one can hardly dispute the enormous potential value of a nationwide effort to inform the public about the serious data and documentation which exist on the UFO subject, and about the need for concentrated scientific study of the phenomenon. It was from this standpoint, then, that I first proposed that we conduct a National UFO Information Week which would be held in the summer of 1985. The reports which have been received from the various MUFON State Directors regarding the observance of the Week in their respective states have indicated clearly that the first National UFO Information Week far exceeded our expectations. The following extracts from some of the reports are largely representative of the majority of the reports received: RESULTS Stan Gordon, of Pennsylvania comments: \"...National UFO Information Week was an over- whelming success in Pennsylvania. We received extensive radio, tv, and press coverage from many sections of the state....Pittsburgh's major paper, the Post Gazette, ran a feature news story with front page header which had an unbelievable response. We had phone calls day and night for 4 days from people who had sightings but did not report to anyone.\" (That night a Pittsburgh TV station did a full feature story mentioning MUFON, and the response was so great that they were beseiged with calls, and continued to voluntarily display the UFO hotline telephone number on later newscasts.) \"What a change in attitude from the public. We saw little if any hard skepticism, with the poeple now willing to listen and believe. Most felt that the government was hiding the facts.\" From Iowa, Donald Curtis reports that although he had to cover the entire state singlehandedly, and although he (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"UFO WEEK, continued . expended hundreds of hours and a like amount of personal funds, he feels that National UFO Information Week was a great success for him and for MUFON. Seven new cases have been referred to Don, and he also has'received a number of applications for membership from interested persons, so he may not be working singlehandedly next year. Francis Ridge, PR Director for Indiana writes, \"Several member/ investigators were signed up as a result of the publicity and there is even a newspaper in Ft. Wayne, the Fort Wayne Sentinel, that is doing UFO articles with our help. This was the worst year for UFO reports on our computer log until the publicity. We now have 19 entries, mostly older reports, but good ones.\" '• . In Oklahoma, Norma J. Waller, also working singlehandedly, managed ,to. get excellent press coverage and radio coverage. In Hawaii, Dr. Michael Brein, also working alone, succeeded in getting great press coverage, including a front page article. Similar reports of very positive tone have been received from Michigan, Northern .California, Utah, New York, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Florida, North Carolina, Georgia as well. In New Jersey, Tom Benson reports that he distributed over 700 MUFON flyers from their display at a shopping mall. Tom also obtained over 100' signatures of persons interested in being placed on a mailing list for information on upcoming UFO events and conferences. In Massachusetts, the UFO Forum was successful beyond all expectations, drawing, persons from 17 States and resulting in extensive press, radio and television coverage. A segment for the program, \"Evening Magazine\" was videotaped at the Forum, and was recently aired. The tone of the presentation is totally positive and the subject, and UFOlogists are both portrayed in a serious light. This film will be shown at the 1986 Symposium at Michigan State University. As was the case in other States, Mass. MUFON also received several sighting reports as well as several membership applications as a result of the events of Up, Up and Away! the Week. Even on the other side of the globe, in Zimbabwe, Africa, Cynthia Hind, MUFON's Continental Coordinator for Africa, was hard at work running a UFO Information Week in that country. Cynthia reports that she had a stand at the Harare Show, amidst some industrial exhibits. She also gave a lecture on the UFO subject for one of the. leading newspapers there. She commented that the people who attended the lecture were desperate for UFO literature. The locations are different, but the story seems to be the same throughout the country and even in Africa. People are misinformed on the UFO subject, but once the misconceptions are corrected and people are presented with sojid, serious information which is well documented, they are not only receptive to the subject, but are fascinated by it. Thus, it is vitally important that we continue our public information program. We will hold our second National UFO Information Week in the summer of 1986, but in the meantime, we cannot afford to take an extended vacation from this endeavor. As Dennis Stacy stated in the August, 1985 MUFON Journal, \"UFOs don't take vacations; why should we?\" PUBLIC The stakes are too high to slack off at this point in our public information effort. An informed public could, and should result in forcing the media to offer more objective, serious coverage of UFO related news stories. An informed public will certainly make a government cover-up of the subject much more difficult. An informed public should result in a vastly increased number of sightings reported to the major UFO research organizations. An informed public will also hopefully effect a change in the respectability status of the subject on the university campuses and a more involved participation on the part of university research departments in serious investigation into the UFO phenomenon. In short, an informed public is a goal that every serious UFOIogist should be striving toward, and should be enthusiastically supportive of, at the very least. Interestingly, as a result of our experience with our first attempt to conduct a National UFO Information Week, we have only achieved positive results as far as the public is concerned, but we have also apparently made some significant strides in improving our own professional image and our own preparedness. As a result of the deep commitment and generosity of many of our State Directors, Asst. State Directors, and Section Directors, several MUFON organizations now (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Pennsylvania Mall Display UFO WEEK, continued have free standing display panels as well as computers, a myriad of investigative tools and types of equipment, and other items such as VCRs, video-cameras, etc. In addition, through the efforts of Walt Andrus, several persons who were previously holding titles, but not performing, have been replaced by others who are energetic and dedicated. There is a steady stream of mail coming into this office from State Directors around the country reporting on their public information endeavors or seeking information for use in their endeavors. Every weekend an average of 4-8 phone calls come in from around the country from State Directors, and others concerned about keeping informed, and actively performing public education on the UFO subject. I have generated literally thousands of pieces of correspondence over the past year in regard to public information and have made hundreds of phone calls nationwide for the same purpose. This has all resulted in a very active and efficient communications network, and in a level of organization in our field which older colleagues tell me is far greater than any organizational level ever achieved in UFOlogy in the past. Coordinating a nationwide information week has made this level of organization imperative, and this will continue to be the case since National UFO Information Week will become an annual event. This result on our own investigative network has been one of the most significant and most constructive benefits we have enjoyed as an indirect result of National UFO Information Week. Furthermore, the image we have been attempting to project of ourselves as \"voluntary professionals\" rather than as mere hobbyists, has apparently paid off. This office has received numerous newspaper clippings from coast to coast in regard to coverage during National UFO Information Week. Without exception (to date), the press coverage in-these,clippings has been on a positive note. Both articles and headlines have portrayed the UFO subject, UFO sightings, witnesses, and UFO investigators and organizations in a straightforward, objective manner, with no sarcasm or ridicule. Both the press and.UFOlogy have progressed a long way in this regard. We have begun to make a miniscule dent in public misinformation on the subject. Our task is far from complete. However, because of the accomplishments we have made this year, we should find the task a bit easier next year, and in the subsequent years ahead. In summary. National UFO Information Week was a worthwhile project which should definitely be repeated in 1986. The dates for National UFO Information Week, 1986 will be August 70-17, 1986. It is not too early to start making preparations for your State's programs and events for (continued on page 16) Iowa Mall Display"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":". .- • - ; • ••••--•-- *£ '%&& W 1 '•' '•• • :>:!.. •;,-*•:- '\"• ->- ^\"?\\ V ' PENNSYLVANIA CLOSE ENCOUNTER By Stan Gordon Bob and Sue (real names on file) recently married and moved into a small cozy house in a rural area near the village of Mutual in Westmoreland County, PA. It was February of 1968, and snow had been falling during the early evening. It was about 11 PM and Bob was in the bedroom preparing to go to sleep since he had to awake early for work. He pulled back the drapes to check the road conditions and was astounded by what he saw. PROBE Next to the house about 30 feet away is a large fishing pond, and hovering near it was a huge oval-shaped object. What first caught Bob's attention was the long gray probe that was only 20 feet distant and directly in 8 front of his window. The probe, one of three such devices connected to the main object, appeared solid and about 10 feet in length. Bob yelled for Sue, cleaning up the kitchen. She looked out the window and screamed, \"Oh my God what is it?\", then the couple continued to watch the hovering object for several more minutes. Sue became frightened and Bob told her to call his brother and wife who lived near Greensburg so they could have other witnesses. . It would take the other couple at least 10 minutes to get to Bob's house. In the meantime, Bob continued to watch the object from the window. It was about 50 to 60 feet in diameter and no more than 30 feet above the pond. The oval object was of a dark battleship gray color with a dome-shaped top. It gave Bob the impression \"that it was old or ancient.\" The bottom of the object was hollow and according to the witness \"it was like looking into an open shaft.\" There were lights inside the open bottom that spun so fast you could not tell what direction they were moving. This opening was about 20 feet in diameter. FIGURE There was a white light emitting from this section which illuminated the area around the craft, giving Bob the opportunity to observe the detail. The entire object was the same color. About %s of the way up the craft, there was a catwalk that was evenly centered. And standing on the catwalk was a single human-like figure with its hands up to its eyes, looking directly at Bob. Behind the figure were portholes and an opening from which red, green, blue, white and orange lights could be seen flashing at times. What looked like instrument panels were seen and at times shadows would move across these apertures as if people were moving around inside. As Bob watched, another similar figure came onto the catwalk and began communicating with the other being. At this point Bob began looking for his clothes in the dark room, and when finally dressed went out on the porch and continued to watch the object which was now beginning to move very (continued on page 17)"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Pilot; Close Encounter SIGHTINGS A Western Air Lines Pilot and former Naval Aviator (Lt.) has shared two sighting experiences with MUFON which are considered interesting, but not of a significant classification. The credibility of the witness adds stature to the report. His responses to the six points describing the incident on the MUFON UFO Sighting Questionnaire (Form 1) is quoted as the source for this short article. (The pilot's name is in the MUFON file.) FIRST SIGHTING \"In November or December of 1984,1 was 'deadheading' in First Class from San Jose, California to Salt Lake City to pick up a Western Air Lines flight in which I was to be the First Officer on a Boeing 737. During the approach to Salt Lake International Airport (Utah), I happened to .be looking to the right side as the Boeing 727 was making its approach to Runway number 34L (landing north). I had been observing the different cloud formations when I noticed that the clouds were beginning to glow red or acquiring a reddish tint at one point in the cloud base. (Weather conditions at the time consisted of cloud layers with an overcast just obscuring the mountain tops just east of Salt Lake City.) The time was 5:30 p.m. M.S.T. \"At first I thought that it was a possible reflection from the distant city lights of Salt Lake City. As I continued to watch the cloud base at that point, I noted that the clouds were becoming more red. Suddenly, a red point of light or a small sphere of light emerged from the cloud base in a vertical descent near the mountains. Continuing .its vertical descent, the light \"dimmed-out\" as it approached the ground as if it decided to switch off its external light. The red light did not go out instantaneously, but dimmed gradually. It appeared to be near the foothills of the mountains when last observed and might possibly have, been landing. The lighting conditions at this time was Dusk, since the Sun had just set. \"I do not believe that this was a conventional aircraft of any kind. A helicopter does not normally take vertical descents into mountainous areas through cloud layers and an overcast. The object behaved unlike anything that I have ever witnessed. I made a mental note of what I had witnessed and then put it out of my mind for a while. The duration of the sighting was 10 seconds.\" SECOND SIGHTING . His second possible UFO sighting . occurred at 7:45 p.m. P.D.S.T. on July 4, 1985, in San Jose, California with his wife as the second witness. \"My wife and I had gone for a drive in the southeast area of downtown San Jose. We were sitting at a stoplight at the corner of Capitol Expressway and Senator Road. My wife called my attention to an object in the sky that she noticed hovering in a stationary position. The object was estimated to be about 4 miles southeast of our position and low on the horizon. \"It was early evening with the sun to our backs and clear sky conditions. As my attention focused on the object, it began to move and shortly thereafter began a steep climb of about 10 - 20 degrees of inclination to the southwest of its original position. Momentarily, it reversed course and descended. It then went into a rapid horizontal zig-zag motion, which could not be accomplished by any aircraft or helicopter that I am aware of. The latter action convinced me it was a probable UFO. \"Just after the object started the zig-zag motion, the stop light turned green and unfortunately I had to move along in the north bound direction on Capitol Expressway. By the time that I could get turned around, the object was gone. The duration of the sighting was 20 to 30 seconds. A sketch on the report form depicts a black disc-shaped object with blunt ends and no apparent lights. He estimated the distance as 4 to 6 miles with the lowest altitude 1000 feet or less. The apparent size was one- twentieth of the full moon.\" NEW HAMPSHIRE CLOSE ENCOUNTER Oct. 15, 1984, Time: 8:42 PM. An anonymous call was received at the Keene, NH Police Department. A man from Winchester, NH, a small town south of Keene, called to report strange looking lights hovering over the city. He refused to give his name, stating his wife would think he was crazy. Sgt. Jack Zeller was dispatched to Route 12 to investigate. It was a clear night in the southern New Hampshire city. Sgt. Zeller did not hurry to the scene because he felt whatever it was would be easily explained or gone by the time he arrived. As he proceeded south on Route 12 toward Route 9, a car coming in his direction skidded to a stop. A man jumped out pointing to the west. Sgt. Zeller stopped his cruiser; he didn't expect to see anything so soon. What he saw was \"obviously unconventional.\" As a trained observer he was able to describe what was seen easily — a number of pulsating lights, red, white, and green, absolutely motionless in the sky at an altitude of 800 to 1000 feet. He estimated the distance at about one eighth of a mile. At this point Zeller called back to headquarters using the car radio. He remained in radio contact throughout the sighting. By now more cars had stopped and more people were observing the show. One of the observers suggested to Sgt.

He is the. author of numerous scientific articles as well as Observing UFOs (1978), . and also edited UFO Phenomena and the Behavioral Scientist'•( 1979).    • Stacy: Dr. Haines, you've let it be known that you are compiling case histories of UFOs sighted from aircraft. Why did you decide to concentrate in this one specific area? Haines: Several reasons were involved, of course, one of them being that pilots represent a very stable personality type with a high degree of training, motivation, and selection. When they say they . have seen something, you know they have seen something. They have a professional reputation at stake, so you also know that when they do come forward and make a report, they have done a pretty good job, by and large, of analyzing in their own mind what it might be and of eliminating a number of explanations already. Another reason would be they have available to them a lot of electromagnetic sensors of various kinds on board the aircraft itself, which can possibly record some manifes- tations of the phenomenon, such as electromagnetic frequency and energy content. Another reason is that pilots can control the location of their plane so that they can manuever to gain the best vantage point, under some conditions. If you're flying a commercial 12 Dr. Richard F. Haines plane, that might not be so easy, but a military jet, for instance, might climb above the phenomenon so that it's seen against the ground as a background. By doing that, you can place some kind of maximum range between you and the object, and if you can determine its 'apparent angle, then you can form a good idea of its size, at least its maximum size. Stacy: How did you initially go about gathering reports? Haines: Initially I was intrigued more than anything else because the literature contains so many good pilot cases. So I went through the files of Project Blue Book on microfilm next and noticed that the quality of those sightings was generally much higher than that of the ground sightings. It also struck me from a historical point of view that no one had done very much with the pilot cases and that's basically how I got started, many years ago. Dennis Stacy In my work, I also deal with a lot of pilots, and one of the routine questions I ask them, is have you ever seen anything you couldn't explain? That got me out of a historical into a more present perspective, and now I have literally contacts all over the Free World with aviation officials who will send me information on a confidential basis. Stacy: Is there any reluctance on the part of the pilots themselves to discuss their sightings? Haines: Sure, there is, which I think is only natural. They have a job at stake. There might be a company policy against it, any number of reasons why you might have to be very careful. Ask yourself why you don't see more UFO articles in all these free magazines in the back of the airplane seat in front of you? The reason I think (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"HAINES, continued is fairly obvious: airline companies don't want their passengers to know that over 3000 pilots have seen these things, even though they're a popular subject. The negative consequences are just too great. Stacy: You mentioned that you came into contact with pilots in the course of your work. Could you tell us a bit more about what that entails exactly? Haines: I'm a research scientist at the Ames Research Center, working in the area of human vision and optics, the way the eye and the brain work together. Technically, the field is known as Aviation Human Factors. We're doing research right now into what information is essential for pilots to land a plane in bad weather, information that is going past them out the side windows, not coming head-on, their peripheral vision. I'm currently heading up a research group focusing on that aspect. The output of that, which is laboratory research, would hopefully be the improvement of cockpit, window design, so that Boing, Lockheed, Douglas and other airplane manufacturers could take into account what the pilot brings into the cockpit, which is his own visual capabilities. They haven't done that by and large. The design process has so many other factors which push the design in one direction that it has received relatively little input from the behavioral sciences. Stacy: Have you been able to formulate the characteristics of a typical aerial sighting as opposed to a ground sighting? Is there any major difference in the two? Haines: No, there are no major differences. I'm convinced now, after a lot of research, that the same phenomenon is being seen by the pilot .as the ground observer. To me, that's an important breakthrough, because it's often said that only crazy people see UFOs. If we can show that a highly stable, mature, responsible group of witnesses is seeing them, then ipso facto, the ground witnesses, as flaky as some of them might be, are also seeing the same phenomenon. Stacy: What might be the typical characteristics of an aerial UFO sighting? HAINES IIN PASADENA — Dennis Stacy Haines: In that respect, I think there are probably more differences than there are similarities, and by that I mean that every case is different. The large issue is what commonalities exist among the cases that refer to the object itself? The flight dynamics, for instance, are probably as diverse and different as the number of sightings. There are categories, though, and I • can tell you about them because I'm writing a book on the subject. First, let's separate the subject into night cases and day cases. Seventy per cent of the aerial sightings occur during the night, 30 per cent occur during the day. Of the nighttime sightings, almost all of them are tiny point -sources of light, like stars, perhaps a single light or a number of them in different patterns. The daytime cases, on the other hand, are almost always angularly large, disc forms, with some sort'of silvery, or aluminum-appearing structure or surface. The nighttime sightings, almost by definition, have to be emitting light, giving off light. The daytime sightings, again almost by definition, have to be reflecting natural light. That's not necessarily or absolutely true, but it's more true than not. Now as regards to flight dynamics, one pattern or category that comes out of the 3000 cases is what might be called the head on approach. Then at the last moment it swerves and avoids contact with the airplane. Those are very interesting because the approach is so fast, even in a light plane, that visual perception doesn't really have time to come into full play and you impute a shape to the object. You say it was a UFO when it may have been just another Cessna, let's say. In many cases like that, though, there is a sub- category in which the object doesn't just speed by, but comes back and hovers off the wing. Stacy: Wouldn't an incident like that indicate that the UFO, or object, was showing a distinct interest in the terrestrial aircraft? Haines: Well, there is another category in which an object will approach a plane, hover nearby, circle it, say, and then stay off one wing-tip awhile, maybe flip over and then hover off the other wing- tip. All I can say is that to the degree that evidence is true, the airplane is the focus of attention. If I were to use words like curiosity and interest, I would be making a lot of assumptions and that's (continued next page) 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"HAINES, Continued not something I would like to do. Those words are a little bit too.\"human.\" I don't know what their motives are, if there is a \"they.\" What if this is an ionization effect? Every engine, whether it's propeller or jet, puts out an ionization trail. If the object happens to be ball- lightning, which is possible, then. perhaps it follows in that ionization trail. That might even explain a head-on approach, if another airplane had gone by earlier. I don't think it would explain the wing-tip or circling effect, though. Stacy: Have you had difficulties approaching military pilots? Haines; More difficulty than not, perhaps. For one thing there is a real hesitancy to tell people stories until you get to know one another. In other words, you have to develop a rapport and as a trained psychologist I've been • helped somewhat because I will never come out and ask a direct question which would turn them off. You have to build up to it. You have to establish •your own credibility and motives. You have, to be transparent, because if they think you're hiding something, forget it! You're probably not going to get any decent data: they'll just make something up to get rid of you. So, I've tended to take the long •term approach of getting to know the person. Too, where I work helps. They know I'm not a kook and that I've got a reputation at stake just like they have. When he knows that and when he knows that I'm going to keep the conversation confidential, then little by little, the barriers begin to come down. Then a certain cascade effect begins to work and the story eventually comes out. Stacy: Has any other sort of data besides the pilot's subjective account become available? I'm thinking of gun camera film, for example. Haines: I don't have access to security information and it's my understanding that 'anything like that would be classified. I will say this, though, that the files of Project Blue Book, which ended in 1969, are absolutely replete with that kind of information, but you can't get at it. It's not there anymore. Stacy: As far as you know, has a flight- 14 recorder ever turned up with information that would pertain to a UFO? Haines: No,, not really that I know of. See, the flight recorder is an endless tape. Every half hour it repeats itself. In the event of a crash, there are switches which turn it off so that you get the last half-hour of flight. To my knowledge, there has never been a case in which an effort was made to directly extract a flight-recorder after a UFO sighting was made. See, flight-recorders are required by law aboard commercial aircaft and the airline companies are there to make money. They don't take a lot of time trailing after UFOs because it's so incidental to what they're doing. I think they would just rather dismiss it and concentrate on turning a profit. Stacy: So, as far as you know, then, a UFO has never been involved in the last thirty minutes of flight of a commercial airliner? Haines: No. — Dcnn.is Stacy Stacy: Have you ever asked the individual pilots or aircraft about their subjective feelings about whatever it was they saw? Whether they were frightened or whatever? Haines: Oh, yeah, that's a common question I ask and I get a small range of answers. That's a good question, . though, that's interesting. The common answer I get is curious, because it isn't intuitive. I have many pilots tell me that during the encounter, when they're being approached or hovered nearby by some strange object, that they had a sense of peace and calm spread over them as if nothing was going to happen, everything's under control, don't worry. Then that feeling goes away when the phenomenon goes away. Stacy: And then they become scared? Haines: Oh, it depends on the situation. If the engines stopped, then they become scared, yes. Stacy: Do the engines usually, start (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"HAINES, Continued back up? Haines: In most cases, yes. I only know of one case in which the engine didn't start back up. The crew bailed out and then the plane crashed. That was a military flight. Stacy: Does the phenomenon effect propeller and jet engines differently, or in any kind of particular pattern? Haines: There aren't that many cases involving actual engine failure and, of course, the operation principles are very different of the two. But that's one of the things we're really interested in, is finding cases that would be diagnostic, that would help us understand the nature of the radiation that is transmitted, if you like, or whatever fields are surrounding the phenomenon. In medical diagnosis of the human body, the doctor goes after patterns of symptoms. He hopes to find a range of symptoms that properly analyzed will diagnose the core problem. I'm trying to use the same approach, that in the electromagnetic domain we might find an array of frequencies, energies, different sensors operating in different ways, that can only operate the way they do because of a certain kind of radiation source — pulsed microwave, — Dennis Stacy for instance, or plasma physics, high magnetic toroidial fields, or a number of other possibilities. That, to me, is the interesting dimension of the UFO phenomenon, and why I spend any time on it at all. I'm not interested in just the psychological or physical dimension. Stacy: Does your evidence indicate to you that the phenomenon is either natural or mechanical? Haines: No, I'm not willing to go that far yet. Stacy: But the possibility exists that it could be a plasma effect or some other entirely natural phenomena? Haines: Sure, it could be. I will say this. I think the phenomenon 'definitely represents an extremely high energy density. I mean high power levels, packed within small volumes. Beyond that, I'm just not ready to say anything. Ask me again in ten years (Laughs). Stacy: You don't see anything in the patterns of behaviour of the phenomenon that would indicate an answer one way or the other as to whether we're dealing with something artificial or organic? Haines: Well, why is there a large peak in aircraft sightings around nine to eleven p.m.? Why is that? Stacy: Because there are more airplanes flying then? Haines: No, that's not the answer. See, the thing about these patterns of behaviour may or may not be diagnostic. We may be dealing with a phenomenon that is purposively deceptive, that is giving us views of itself that are not true. It's called deception strategy and the military does it all the time. It's an art of war and . of government intelligence agencies. For all we know, we've been fed a line of deceptions from the very beginning under a longterm master plan, if you will, to lead us into a totally erroneous view of what . the phenomenon is. That's pretty far out, I admit, for a nuts'n'bolts person like me, which I tend to be. But I have to take it seriously. I have to entertain the possibility, so I don't take everything at face value. I have to consider as many as possibilities as there are. This phenomenon, whatever it is, is one of the last frontiers. I think outer space is a frontier, I think the human brain is a frontier, and I think the UFO phenomenon is a frontier. Stacy: 'And might there be a connection between all three? Haines: You said that. I'll say it's an interesting study. Stacy: Dr. Haines, we thank you.

From the mass of evidence collected on these types of cases, McCampbell has managed to distill several reoccurring facts. From his book, Ufology, we find the following observations: 1. \"It is abundantly clear that a strange, hitherto unrecognized force prevails within a cylindrical zone having the same diameter as . the UFO and extending from it to the ground.\" 2. \"The force acts vertically upward upon various objects, imparting to them a rotation.\" 3. \"As no stones or dry sticks seem to have been affected, the force apparently couples selectively to objects, presumably on the basis of their composition.\" It's puzzling that UFOs exert an upward force when normal experience would seem to indicate a downward thrust that would be required to keep their craft in the air. It is possible the upward force the UFOs exert is separate from the UFOs propulsion system. Unfortunately, one can only speculate until we have in our possession a functional UFO craft. But for witnesses like Catherine Burk, the ability of UFOs to levitate a motor vehicle is more than mere speculation. WEEK, Continued next August.

At this time the other couple pulled in the driveway, and they all jumped into the car and followed the object as it began to move over a hill, still only about 50 feet off the ground. Bob's brother, who was driving while trying to watch the object, got the car stuck on the slick road and they all got out to watch the hovering craft which was now directly above them. A brilliant light, was emitted,from the bottom of the craft, obscuring the shape of the object. It remained completely silent, as it had during the entire encounter. The light suddenly began to accelerate vertically into the sky until it looked like one of the other stars. It then changed to a brilliant red color, moving straight across the sky and out of sight. The entire episode lasted nearly 20 minutes. Two witnesses observed the object at a distance of no more than 30 feet and two additional observers came to the scene and verified the observation. DISBELIEF This UFO encounter had a drastic affect on Bob's life since he was a profound disbeliever in UFO reports prior to this experience. A number of years before his sighting, Bob and his younger brother who witnessed this event were discussing UFO reports that had been on the evening news and they nearly ended up in a fist fight since Bob suggested that only crazy people saw those things. For 5 years Bob had been in the Navy, and was in fact a hangar deck aircraft director on one of our country's largest aircraft carriers and was quite, familiar with military aircraft. As Bob told me, \"If I hadn't seen it for myself, I could not have been convinced.\" Bob took a lot of ridicule after telling various relatives and friends about his encounter. He no longer worries about that. He knows what he saw and is now convinced UFO's are real. NEW HAMPSHIRE, Continued he shine the cruiser spotlight at the object. The spotlight used was 200,000 candle power. \"I was right on aim,\" but it. didn't light the object. (I feel Zeller's estimate of one eighth of a mile was incorrect. The spotlight should have reached it at that distance.) As soon as the light was on aim the object began to move toward the cruiser. It lowered altitude as it came closer. The object leveled off at a height of 100 feet, not far from the observers. As it continued to get closer one of the bystanders asked Sgt. Zeller to get his shotgun. Zeller responded with \"No, I think we'll ride this one out.\" The object passed directly over the cruiser at a speed of 10 to 15 miles per hour. \"I had it lit up like daylight,\" Zeller stated. He described the object as having a dull metallic off-white or cream color. It was 10 to 15 feet wide and 45 to 50 feet long. The belly had longitudinal planes from front to back like the hull of a boat. He saw no landing gear, no windows, no seams, no doors, no obvious source of power, and it made no sound except for a two-toned hum for a second or two as it passed directly overhead. The police sergeant also stated he may have seen short stubby wings, but he is not sure if he saw them or someone mentioned them. The object continued its straight flight path over the cruiser, across the street and then stopped over a car wash. It turned around as if to come back to the cruiser, hovered a few seconds, then instantly moved sideways to hover over the Ramada Inn at the junction of Route 9 and Route 10. It hovered again for a few seconds, then moved to the south- east at a leisurely pace. It then sped off into space and was out of sight in a second or two.  , The initial interview with Sgt. Zeller and the audio tape recording of that interview was conducted by Mr. William J.

November 1985 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Jupiter is now the only evening planet. It is due south at dusk and sets in the WSW about 9:45 PM in midmonth. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus is getting difficult to see in the eastern sky, rising only about 1J4 hours before sunrise in midmonth. Meanwhile its much fainter reddish neighbor Mars, in Virgo, is well up in the SE before the sun rises. Meteor Showers: A bright gibbous moon interferes all night during the Taurids peak on November 3. The slow reddish meteors normally reach about 15 per hour before dawn. On the other hand, the swiftest of all shower meteors, the bluish Leonids, achieve maximum (15 per hour) under dark skies on the 17th. Halley's Comet: This famous celestial visitor has left Orion and during November races across Taurus and Aries, entering Pisces near the end of the month. Early this fall Halley was somewhat fainter than expected. If it gets back \"on track\" and attains 7th or 8th magnitude by mid-November, it would then be visible through binoculars as a tailless smudge of light. The comet passes north of the V-shaped Hyades from Nov. 10-12 and south of the Pleiades on the 16th and 17th. By the 18th Halley becomes accessible all night, rising in the NE at sunset and setting in the NW at sunrise. It passes within 58 million miles of the earth on the 26th enroute to the sun; a somewhat closer second approach to earth occurs on the comet's outbound leg next April. Once again best viewing is around the middle of the month when the moon is out of the way. On the 15th Comet Halley's position is at R.A. 3h 49m, Dec. +21°47' (1950); this places it in the same binocular field as the Pleiades-a beautiful sight! o (continued on page 17) Moon Phases: Last quarter--Nov. 5 New moon--Nov. 12 First quarter-Nov. 19 Full moon-Nov. 27 The Stars: The bright constellations of winter-Orion the Hunter, Taurus the Bull, Auriga the Charioteer, Gemini the Twins-are already appearing above the eastern horizon at 9 PM in midmonth.

Marge Christenscn has submitted an article for the Journal with photographs depicting a few of the highlights. It was a very good example of cooperation between CUFOS, the Fund for UFO Research, and MUFON. Plans are already underway for the 1986 program. * * * A committee organized during the UFO Forum in Beverly, Massachusetts has submitted proposed plans for greater cooperation between CUFOS, FUFOR, and MUFON, whereby each will have basic responsibilities thus reducing duplication of effort and ensuring maximum utilization of our resources. The three major UFO research organizations have unique resources and assets to offer to the field of UFOlogy. By capitalizing upon these unique assets, we should be able to significantly advance serious research into the UFO phenomenon as well as to make further progress toward eradicating the popularly held notion of the UFO subject being \"pseudo- science\" practiced by mere hobbyists. * * •* For the past two years Mrs. Marge Christensen has been serving in a dual role as the State Director for Massachusetts and nationally as MUFON's Public Relations Director. The latter has become virtually a full- time job considering the many activities that Mrs. Christensen has implemented. Upon the submission of her resignation as State Director for Massachusetts, the Massachusetts MUFON Board of Directors recommend James R. Melescius, presently the State Section Director for Norfolk County, to fill this post. Forrest R. Lundberg has recommended the following MUFON reorganization for the state of Iowa: Donald A. Curtis has been elevated Marge Christensen from Assistant State Director to State Director for Iowa, replacing Mr. Lundberg who has accepted the position of State Section Director for Polk and Warren Counties. Leonard Sturm, State Director for Illinois, has appointed Robert Matheny as the State Section Director for Edgar County. Mr. Matheny has a B.A. in sociology and social work. Hal Starr of Phoenix, Arizona has been approved as the new State Section Director for Maricopa County. Mr. Starr is best known for the longest continuous daily UFO radio show in the world, starting in 1947 and heard in 7 English speaking countries. Donald M. Ware, State Director for Florida, has announced the appointment of Duane E. Pike of Tampa to become the State Section Director for Hillsborough, Pinellas, and Polk Counties. Mr. Pike, a former MUFON member in 1979 to 1981, was a Captain in the U.S. Army in artillery and military intelligence. * * * H.B.O.'s \"America Undercover\" cable television show titled \"UFOs: What's Going On?\" produced by Robert Guenette Productions and directed by Fred Rosen ran ten different times as a special, starting September 10th and ending on September 29th.
