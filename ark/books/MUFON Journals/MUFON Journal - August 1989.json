FROM THE EDITOR The new slick cover stock gracing this issue is one of several cosmetic changes scheduled for the Journal in the near future, time, energy and money, of course, permitting. The 28 pages, however, are a temporary matter, partly to compensate for my expanded coverage of the Las Vegas symposium. Eventually, we hope to be able to redo the Journal's entire format, a painstaking process that will hopefully reflect not only our own growing, if limited, prosperity, but also that of the field of ufology itself. We mention this not to boast of any achievement before its time, but to let you, the reader and subscriber, know that much goes on behind the scenes of every issue that you may not normally be aware of, in addition to the everyday business of editing, proofreading and layout. Our aim, as always, is to bring you the best UFO journal available. Occasionally, we are late in our obligations, as happened with the July issue. If it's any consolation, I'm happy to say it was because of circumstances beyond our control. Our lineup this month is as follows.

This year's conclave, with a theme of \"The UFO Cover-Up: A Government Conspiracy?\" definitely fell into the latter category. Chaired by John Lear and vocally orches- trated by the melodious basso pro- fondo of Hal Starr, the symposium was fraught with controversy from the start. By Saturday evening, temper- atures inside the Aladdin Hotel and Casino lecture halls almost matched those of the sun-baked Las Vegas \"Strip\" outside, where the thermome- ter regularly reached 105 degrees Fahrenheit and more. The usual Friday evening get-acquaint- ed and cocktail hour was preceded by a press conference held that morning and a meeting of MUFON state direc- tors moderated by Dan Wright. Pre- registration packets were available in the foyer outside the main 600-seat auditorium, along with a photo display and tables of various literature. The evening cocktail hour itself transpired in a cavernous hall that did little to dampen spirits. Following Saturday morning intro- ductions from Lear, Starr and inter- national director Walter Andrus, Jen- nie Zeldman, MUFON's co-ordinator of technical analysis, updated events in the Coyne Helicopter case, recip- ient of a $5000 award from the National Enquirer in 1973, for best UFO case of the year. Coyne Copter Case The encounter with what then Capt. Lawrence J. Coyne, the aircraft commander, described as a cigar or submarine-shaped object occurred on October 18, 1973, near Mansfield, Ohio. A four-man crew was onboard. At first showing only a red light, the object reportedly paced the helicopter MUFON UFO Journal, No. 256, August 1989 Aladdin Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas along the eastern horizon, then \"des- cribed a zig-zag flight path as it main- tained a position above and in front of the helicopter, and then resumed its westward course,\" disappearing on the NW horizon. \"At closest approach,\" Zeidman said, \"the object was seen to be submarine-shaped, opaque and sharply defined, with two precisely positioned lights and an intense green maneuverable spotlight. Anomalies of controls, instruments and radios, and unexplained altitude gain of the helic- opter were noted. Five witnesses have been found who were nearly directly below the encounter point.\" Zeidman herself has authored a previous lengthy report on the Coyne encounter and continues to collect data on the case, including interviews with two ground witnesses who only recently surfaced. However, Zeidman's talk was only half aimed at actual events in the Coyne case; the remainder, the tart part, was reserved for what she characterized as the less than half-hearted investigation con- ducted by UFO skeptic Philip Klass, who continues to catalog the Coyne object as a probable meteor. Her main objection is that Klass has never troubled to interview Coyne person- ally, nor bothered to talk to at least two of the other three crewmen; in fact, his interrogation of those aboard the chopper seems to have been limited to three telephone calls. A few slightly more acerbic darts were also hurled in the direction of Mr. Klass, who seems to delight in being the target of such barbs. As it turned out, Jennie was only the first of several speakers who would not disappoint him. New Patterns in Car Pursuits Dr. Donald A. Johnson of New Jersey, MUFON's consultant in re- search psychology, addressed the issue of UFO cases in which apparent elec- tromagnetic interference with a vehi- cle's ignition system played a promi- nent role. Johnson has collected some 200 such cases, dating from March of 1949 to July of 1978, consi- 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Jennie Zeldman dered on the completeness of data. To be included in his vehicular inter- ference catalog, such incidents had to contain pertinent information as to the reported UFO's size and distance, as well as to the duration of the over- all event. The general conclusion Johnson was able to draw from a statistical analysis of such interference cases is \"that UFOs of similar appearance behave in a similar manner.\" But other inferences could be made as well. \"The most prevalent pattern involving the pacing of a vehicle by a UFO,\" according to Johnson, \"can be characterized as involving a domed, disk-shaped object, approximately nine meters (35 ft.) in diameter, with the presence of a humming sound. \"Physiological effects are usually accompanied by the mention of some 4 type of light beam emanating from the object and the presence of a blue color.\" Oddly, although police vehi- cles account for fifteen percent of all non-interference cases, they contrib- ute very few incidents in which stal- ling or stopping is recorded. Johnson said this \"could probably be explained by the fact that in a number of these cases the police were actively pursu- ing the UFO, and not the other way around.\" It appears, he continued, \"that the UFO EM ignition effect itself is something that is selectively applied rather than some uniform force result- ing from a hypothetical propulsive system or unexplained natural force.\" Crash/Retrieval Plan? Aside from the controversy of whether any UFOs have crashed and been covertly retrieved by the govern- ment, is the matter of whether or not an emergency retrieval program exists within the confines of a government or military context. It might be worth- while, argued aviation writer Don Ber- liner, a member of the executive committee of the Fund for UFO Research, to consider what such a program might look like from the out- side. How would it function in the real world? What kind of experts would comprise its ranks? And what would its goals be? If such a plan is presently in effect, noted Berliner, it conceivably could have had its beginnings in events dur- ing or near the close of WW II. Two likely candidates for such an impetus, he suggested, were the reports of \"Foo Fighters\" and the \"ghost rocket\" scare that swept Scandanavia shortly after the cease of hostilities. Both would have provided ample opportun- ity for any government/military agency interested in retrieving samples of either. Then there was the alleged crash of a UFO near Roswell, New Mexico, in the summer of 1947, if further emphasis were needed. The obvious point here is that of a number of alleged crash-retrievals, all have remained effectively secreted from the average citizen. Berliner postulates that a wide network of human and electronic sensors must be employed if the C/R Control team is to be \"first on the scene\" and effec- tive. He even suggests that the coun- try's police forces might be involved. I personally find that idea difficult to countenance: Too many individuals would have knowledge of any appli- cable orders. Sooner or later, one of them would be almost certain to have leaked pertinent documents or infor- mation to the media, resulting in a public row. The make-up of any such organiza- tion, however, would be fairly com- plex, although not necessarily unwield- ly, said Berliner. Several different types of equipment would be required, including metal and radiation detec- tors, digging and transportation devi- ces, medical supplies, recording equip- ment, security staples and packing material, perhaps even body bags. After the site has been rendered secure, other equally important fac- MUFON UFO Journal, No. 256, August 1989"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"tors come into play. From the top of a pyramid structure on down, a variety of personnel would be needed, from a \"retrieval\" commander, to \"grunts,\" or guards. In-between, communica- tion, technical and scientific personnel of various sorts would be required. The great majority of these would be different from those in charge of the actual removal of material, which would account for another body of personnel. Once the physical and perhaps bio- logical remains are safely removed to a secure site, the work of deciphering could begin in earnest. Among the areas Berliner suggested such a team of experts might conceivably investi- gate: construction of the craft itself, propulsion system(s), flight control and navigation mechanisms, commun- ication and life support systems, crew facilities, maintenance and repair tech- niques, and of course the nature of the crew itself and their \"mission,\" or intensions. Even so, such a highly secretive structure as a C/R Control team would still be confronted with oppor- tunities for snafus, some of which might obviously lie outside their ability to contain. The most potentially dam- aging of these, of course, is the pos- sibility of a messy crash in full view of the public. Security leaks and unantic- ipated foul-ups, like a piece of wreck- age falling off a flatbed 18-wheeler in St. Louis, would also have to be antic- ipated, and might be a job for a separate damage-control team. \"Though much of this is theory and speculation,\" Berliner admitted, \"it may serve as a starting point from which further thought may lead to greater knowledge of the crash/re- trieval system, and perhaps to methods for re-directing it to the service of the public.\" Chesapeake Connection After lunch, Bob Oechsler, MUFON state section director for Maryland, intrigued the audience with a talk entitled \"The Chesapeake Connec- tion: An Implication of Corporate Involvement in the UFO Cover-Up.\" Oechsler presently hosts a nationwide broadcast on the airwaves of the American Radio Network called \"UFOs MUFON UFO Journal, No. 256, August 1989 Philip Klass Today.\" He has been involved in both the photographic analysis of the Gulf Breeze case, and the apparently spur- ious voice recording \"broadcast\" by the space shuttle Discouery. Following a series of sightings of large lighted objects near the Chesa- peake Bay Bridge in March of 1988, some of which reportedly lasted up to four hours long, and none of which elicited an obvious military response, Oechsler and other active members of the Annapolis Research and Study Group formed the Chesapeake Con- nection hypothesis, the basic tenets of which are as follows: • UFOs exist, and the technology and obvious intelligence behind them present a valid and far-reaching con- cern. • Individuals and groups, both with- in the government and private sec- tors, respond to such knowledge by imposing a justifiable cover-up which is still in existence today. • Our advanced defense technol- ogy programs do not appear to be directed at a traditional enemy. The evidence simply does not support such a conclusion. The focus setting, in fact, is extraterrestrial in nature. While Oechsler's group was engaged in tracing the corporate connection to assumed events like the Roswell inci- dent and the formation of MJ-12, he and his fellow researchers were inun- dated with a wave of local UFO reports, including frequent sightings of growing numbers of helicopters, both marked and unmarked. They also uncovered evidence of curious goings on in the Bay area, the coun- try's longest estuary, just east of Washington, D.C. These activities 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"included, among other things, a barge apparently engaged in a Navy pro- gram testing or monitoring the elec- tromagnetic pulse effect (EMP) asso- ciated with nuclear blasts. According to Oechsler, such experiments may have severely damaged at least one bridge, and could have resulted in the loss of at least one small private plane and its two occupants. Oechsler explains corporate invol- vement in the UFO cover-up not only as a consequence of the incestuous relationship among top level CEOs, government officials and civilian \"think tanks,\" but also out of a need corpo- rations have to maintain a stable society of consumers. Having them fly into a fit of panic over the realization that \"we are not alone,\" in other words, would not be good for business. So great is corporate concern, in fact, that the larger players have banded together to bombard consu- mers with subliminal messages aimed at effecting a gradual assimilation of this potential earth-shattering concep- tion into society as a whole. To this end, the corporate power structure increasingly employs suggestive hints of an extraterrestrial presence, both in commercials, TV programs and movies like E-T and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Despite the wealth of documented and illustrated material Oechsler and the Annapolis Research and Study Group have compiled, this writer, at least, kept wondering if the cart hadn't gotten before the horse in some of the examples cited. Applying the same logic to the popularity of vampire movies and images, for in- stance, would force one to conclude that movie magnates were somehow intent on preparing society to accept blood-sucking bats as an underlying reality. Something of the same sort of criti- cism could be made about certain allegations leveled in connection with the Roswell incident. Is it fair, on the one hand, to tout New Mexico as the nerve center of American military weaponry research and development, then express surprise and discovery on the other when high-level generals and government officials pay a visit? One would think, after all, that that would be their business. In the same \"UFOs exist Individuals and groups, both within the government and pri- vate sectors, responded to such knowledge by imposing a justifiable cov- er-up which is still in existence today.\" context, it never seems to have occurred to Oechsler that the District of Columbia itself is a similar hotbed of government, military and related in- telligence activities by virtue almost of definition. The baby should not be thrown out to dry with the bathwater, and admittedly Oechsler scores many interesting points. But his approach also demonstrates that with such an all-encompassing, conspiratorial hypoth- esis, almost any single piece can be accommodated to fit the puzzle. An Alien Harvest An equally perplexing puzzle was presented by Linda Moulton Howe, a regional Emmy Award-winning pro- ducer of TV documentaries, mostly in the realm of environmental sciences. Her symposium talk was an out- growth of research that originated with the 1980 video documentary, \"A Strange Harvest,\" which focused on animal mutilations. Such mutilations continue down to the present day, said Howe, who brought startling slides taken only this spring with her to prove her case. Howe was accom- panied by two confirming witnesses. The complete story of her most recent research and involvement with both mutes and UFOs can be found in her massive self-published book, An Alien Harvest (448 pages, $60, including postage), available from LMH Productions, 3208 East Fremont Drive, Littleton, CO 80122. Howe's most recent case, and one of her more remarkable ones, comes from Hempstead County, Arkansas, where on the morning of March 10, 1989, an L.C. Wyatt found five dead, pregnant cows on his property, laid out along a straight line. One cow had her belly cut open from an 18-by- 22 inch incision, accomplished by a highly-heated cutting instrument of some sort, a technology that would seem to be beyond the means and capabilities of the \"average\" satanic or other cult. The unborn calf was still within the unbroken embryo sac; there was no blood or amniotic fluid on the cow, calf or ground. Linda Howe and Host, John Lear MUFON UFO Journal, No. 256, August 1989"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"\"// these mutilations and human abductions are providing sustenance and genetic experimentation for the alien beings, it is a one-way trade route. What is taken is not paid for. And what is left behind is fear, anger, dead animals and traumat- ized people.\" Arkansas, particularly the southw- est corner, had been plagued the year before by a series of sightings of a large object or objects known locally as \"Big Bertha.\" Numerous photo- graphs of nocturnal lights were taken during the winter of 1987-88, many of them by Jim Williamson, editor of the Little River News. An embossed ver- sion of one of Williamson's more v dramatic pictures, a 30-second time exposure showing a light executing two right-angle turns, adorns the cover of Howe's Harvest. The night before the five dead mutilated cows were discovered, Williamson, return- ing from a basketball game, spotted a \"golden glowing\" light similar to those he had already photographed, about fifty aerial miles from the Wyatt farm. Williamson, who was present and joined Howe on the stage during her presentation, .also took samples from the dead animals, which he preserved and express-shipped to Howe in Colo- rado. Howe then had the specimens examined by veteran veterinarian Dr. John Altshuler, who also joined the presentation in person. It was Alt- shuler, with the aid of color photomi- crographs of the incised area, who was able to demonstrate that \"the cutting was done quickly with a hot instrument of some kind,\" probably in excess of 300 degrees Fahrenheit, and indicative of either laser or hot needle surgery. Howe also presented evidence, pri- marily from the two abduction cases, and obtained under regressive hypno- sis, which seems to indicate an inti- mate involvement of the alleged abductors with animal mutilations. \"If these mutilations and human abduc- tions,\" Howe concluded, \"are provid- ing sustenance and genetic experi- mentation for the alien beings, it is a one-way trade route. What is taken is not paid for. And what is left behind MUFON UFO Journal, No. 256, August 1989 is fear, anger, dead animals and tra- umatized people.\" Above Top Secret Howe was followed to the speakers' platform by Timothy Good of Lon- don, author of the near-encyclopedie Above Top Secret: The Worldwide UFO Cover-Up, published in this country last year by William Morrow & Co. By the time you read this, the paperback version from Morrow's Quill imprint may well be available. As indicated by the title of his book and talk, Good dealt mainly with a wealth of official documentation indic- ative of a reluctance on the part of major world governments to reveal to, their various publics what they know or suspect about UFOs. One of the earliest such indications stems from a nighttime \"invasion\" of Los Angeles that took place on February 25, 1942, over the 5-hour course of which more than 1400 artillery shells were fired without apparent effect. At least one poor photograph was taken of an object caught in a searchlight beam, shells exploding harmlessly all around. In 1946, unidentified \"ghost rockets\" were seen and photographed over the Scandanavian countries; the following Timothy Good"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"It soon became evident that part of Moore's exchange with Falcon would involve supplying the big bird of prey with information about the activi- ties of APRO and certain individuals, one of whom was Paul Bennewitz. year, Greece suffered similar over- flights. That country's leading scient- ist, Professor Paul Santorini, was asked to investigate. \"But before we could do anymore,\" Santorini advised, \"the Army, after conferring with for- eign officials, ordered the investigation stopped.\" That same year, the UFO pheno- menon broke in the United States, and since then virtually every country in the world has at one time or another been visited by similar reports. And in most instances, their respec- tive government and military bodies have publicly denied active knowledge of or interest in the subject. Privately, their reactions have usually been an altogether different matter, as Good's slide illustrations of various docu- ments showed. On rare occasion, a high-ranking official even goes on record. During the 1973-74 French flap, Robert Galley, the Minister of Defense, said in a radio interview that \"if listeners could see for themselves the mass of reports coming in from the airborne gendarmerie, from the mobile gendarmerie, and from the gendarmerie charged with the job of investigations, all of which reports are forwarded by us to the National Cen- ter for Space Studies, they would see that it is all pretty disturbing.\" \"UFOs are an embarrasment to the Establishment,\" Good added. \"We are practically powerless, and therefore have no control over the situation. It is not simply a matter of one race of beings coming to this planet. There appear to be different groups, not all of whom are benevolent.\" Good closed with an observation the psychologist Carl Jung once made to Donald Keyhoe, to the effect that if the government truly was withholding knowledge of UFOs from the public, it was \"the most unpsychological and stupid policy one could invent. It is self-evident that the public ought to 8 be told the truth, because ultimately it will come to light. There can hardly be any greater shock than the H- Bomb and yet everybody knows of it without fainting.\" Saturday Night Live For awhile, however, it appeared as if some people would rather fight than faint in the wake of several startling revelations made by William Moore during the course of his over two- hour speech Saturday evening. Moore was originally scheduled to address the symposium at 7 pm, to be fol- lowed by Stanton Friedman, and a panel of speakers that were to have questions put to them by members of MUFON's board of directors. But when Moore had not arrived at the auditorium by seven, Friedman led off with his own talk, an update of ongoing investigations into the MJ-12 and related documents. Friedman man- aged to elicit a nice ring of laughter when he asked if anyone had seen the TV documentary, \"UFO Cover- Up ... Live!\" \"Good,\" Friedman said. \"You only wasted two hours. I wasted three days.\" More to the point, Friedman recounted that thus far the controversial MJ-12 briefing document, along with the so-called Cutler-Twining and Truman-Forrestal memos, contin- ued to hold water. Friedman, as most of you are probably aware, was recently awarded a $16,000 grant, ufology's largest, from the Fund for UFO Research (Whitley Strieber and MUFON also contributed), specifi- cally for the purpose of delving into the authenticity of said documents. A complete report will probably be available by year's end, or shortly thereafter. In the meantime, Friedman con- tinues to wend his way through the labyrinth of presidential papers, inter- viewing survivors from the beginning of the MJ-12 era, or their family or associates, in the search for data that would either confirm or dismiss the MJ-12 documents altogether. In the process, Friedman managed to add a thousand dollars to the MJ-12 pot, thanks to an ill-considered wager on the part of Philip Klass. Klass had offered Friedman $100 for each genuine Cutler memo in pica type that he could produce, up to ten items. I'm sure Friedman and ufologists every- where welcome Klass's contribution; but given the ongoing disupte between the two, I confess to a surprise disap- pointment: I had expected Friedman to flash a slide of Klass's canceled check. Probably the most unexpected de- velopment thus far is Friedman's uncovering of the second \"secret\" career of one Dr. Donald H. Menzel, the late UFO debunker and Harvard astronomer, whom the MJ-12 docu- ments identify as one of its original members. In fact, Menzel was quite deeply involved with security and intelligence matters, even while author- ing or co-authoring three books dis- missing and debunking UFOs. If Fried- man was not the first researcher to make this revelation public, he was almost certainly the first to bring it to widespread attention. We look for- ward to seeing Friedman's final report, and on the side, we bet Mr. Klass does, too. Moore on Moore Shortly before Bill Moore was sche- duled to go on stage, I met him in the foyer outside the main lecture hall. He was as boyishly buoyant as I've ever seen him, but admitted he was about to make a confession. Not knowing what the context might be, I could only resort to the standard cliche. \"Well,\" I noted, \"they're said to be good for the soul.\" Still, along with the rest of the audience, I had no idea what he was about to reveal, nor the impact it would ultimately have. In fact, I'm not sure I have any better handle on it now. But for the record, from my seat, several rows from the front, here's what transpired. \"In early September, 1980,\" Moore said, \"I was approached by a well- MUFON UFO Journal, No. 256, August 1989"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"placed individual within the intelli- gence community who claimed to be directly connected to a high-level government project dealing with UFOs.\" This individual, according to Moore, he subsequently code-named \"Falcon.\" Moreover, Moore claimed, this per- son was not Air Force Office of Spe- cial Intelligence agent Richard C. Doty, as some have claimed. Doty, in fact, was only the liaison man between Moore and his feathered friend; Doty himself was supposedly referred to as \"Sparrow,\" which is a smaller bird altogether than a falcon. Moore, at the time, was on the board of directors of APRO, the Aerial Phenomena Research Organi- zation, operated by Jim and Coral Lorenzen of Phoenix. It soon became evident, said Moore, that part of Moore's exchange with Falcon would involve his supplying the big bird of prey with information about the activ- ities of APRO and certain individuals, one of whom was Paul Bennewitz of Albuquerque, a physicist who had his own small electronics company near Kirtland AFB, the Manzano Nuclear Storage Facility, and Sandia National Laboratories, site of the Saturn machine, a gigantic circular device used in EMP testing. Bennewitz, already deeply involved in UFOs, was about to become ensnared in ways even his fertile brain would have been hard pressed to predict at the time. (It was rumored that he eventually suffered a nervous breakdown and eventually had to be hospitalized under psychi- atric care. According to another source, Bennewitz's son later denied his father had ever been committed; it is true, however, that his business suffered, and his own physical and mental health underwent drastic decline dur- ing the ordeal.) Bennewitz not only claimed to film and photograph UFOs regularly from his roof top, he also said he was able to monitor the low frequency EM sig- nals whereby the aliens communi- cated with surgical implants placed in humans during abductions. Moreover, he had written his own computer program whereby he was able to translate these \"control\" signals. Ap- parently, it was Bennewitz's electronic monitoring of these low frequency signals that attracted the attention of MUFON UFO Journal, No. 256, August 1989 Bennewitz not only claimed to film and photograph UFOs regularly from his roof top, he also said he was able to monitor the low frequency EM signals whereby the aliens communicated with surgical implants placed in humans during abductions. the Air Force Office of Special Intelli- gence (AFOSI). Presumably, these signals, which could hardly be shielded, were associated either directly or indirectly with any one of a number of Star Wars or related technologies. And seemingly, the AFOSI approached Bennewitz and asked him to voluntar- ily cease his activities, an action which unwittingly convinced Benne- witz that he had indeed stumbled onto some \"secret\" of great signifi- cance. His reaction instead was \"to get on the horn,\" according to Moore, calling and writing letters to everyone from fellow ufologists and representa- tives of various media, to congress- men and the president of the United States. In addition, said Moore, Ben- newitz proved a most persuasive per- sonality in person. Eventually, his influence spread far and wide within the community of UFO researchers and writers. Unfortunately, Bennewitz himself, again according to Moore, was also under the influence, in this case of the AFOSI and their col- leagues. \"They were actively trying to defuse him,\" Moore allowed, \"by pumping as much disinformation through him as he could possibly absorb.\" Being a very small part of that pro- cess, Moore added, \"gave me some- thing of an advantage, and it became my intention to play that advantage for all the information I could get out of it.\" By this time in his talk, Moore was being vocally challenged by different accusers in the audience, who inter- rupted on several occasions. I, per- sonally, was transfixed, as I'm sure were others, by the tale unfolding. A couple of people even stumbled out of the lecture hall, gripped by a com- bination of shock, anguish and tears. It would have taken a very large pin to have been heard over the ensuing hubbub. When order was restored, Moore went on to say that the campaign of disinformation aimed at Bennewitz succeeded far beyond anyone's expec- tations. More than a few misunder- stood Moore to say that he willingly and knowingly participated in the dis- persal of disinformation, which includ- ed the distribution of counterfeit doc- umentation. Moore said later -that he was not aware the documents were false at the time, and that he with- drew from participation sometime in 1984, when he learned the full extent of the deception. By this time, however, another gear had been added to the disinformation transmission, and the cog caught in its turning was Linda Howe. Her own disappointing dealings with a decep- tive Doty eventually resulted in Home Box Office canceling her contract to produce a UFO documentary for the cable channel. Again, the reason seems to have been that Howe intended using Bennewitz as a princi- pal source. Other researchers who availed themselves of the tempting and sometimes convincing conduit of UFO \"information\" Bennewitz repre- sented were duped as well, with the consequence that much of what was intended to discredit Bennewitz per- sonally subsequently surfaced as an \"inside scoop\" among a few incestu- ous ufologists, whereby it gradually spread out to infect almost the entire community. The entire Bennewitz scenario, Moore claimed, was essentially intact as early as the middle of 1982. Among other elements, it contained the notion that two groups of aliens are present on the planet, one benign, and one, the \"greys,\" not so benign. The latter, in fact, were said to be \"responsible for the cattle mutilations, for human abductions and the implanting of sin- ister control devices in humans, for having first made and then broken a secret treaty with the U.S. govern- 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Dr. Jacques Vallee ment, for maintaining a secret under- ground base under Archuleta Peak near Dulce in northwestern New Mexico, and for having supplied the U.S. govern- ment with alien space hardware and weapons which ultimately proved defec- tive or were made to crash, thus leaving human civilization virtually defenseless against invasion.\" Both Moore and Friedman directed disparaging remarks at the article by Robert Hastings which appeared in the June issue of the Journal. But similar allegations and insinuations about Moore's activities had been circulating for sometime. It might be presumptuous to suggest that their open airing resulted in his remarkable statement; maybe it was only one of many straws. What remains to be seen, however, is whether Moore's symposium speech clears up or muddies further ufology's already 10 murky waters. Hopefully, it will leave the lake a whole lot less contaminated with the pollutants of rumor, innuendo and deliberately doctored data. At any rate, Moore left the stage through a rear door, counseling patience, and promising all would be revealed in due time. Whether it will come as any more of a shock or surprise than what he had to say on a hot Saturday night in Las Vegas, also remains to be seen. (A word-for-word transcript of his revealing talk can be obtained by ordering the current issue of Moore's newsletter, Focus. $10, from 4219 W. Olive Ave., Suite 247, Burbank, CA 91505; the paper is not included in the published MUFON symposium Proceedings.) An Alternate Agenda Early Sunday morning several speak- ers who were not on the official agenda had the opportunity to pres- ent their own views on the UFO phe- nomenon and possible government involvement with same. These included John Lear, William Cooper, Don Ecker and Bill English, who have their own ferverent following. In fact, any- one thinking that Moore's revelations of the night before might have defused what this group had to say would have been disappointed. The affair, to which an additional $10 admission fee was charged, was well attended. I was unable to stay for the entire program, so it may be somewhat unfair to characterize most of what I heard as long on assertion and short on evi- dence. But clearly the cadre of con- spiratorialists has its own hardcore supporters, with or without any \"offi- cial\" sanctions anything as loosely defined as ufology has to offer or withhold. I was intrigued by much of what I did see, but still found it hard to commit to a galloping string of unsup- ported assertions that included state- ments like a) a group of 80 dissident scientists opposed to the alien/U.S. government diplomatic treaty were massacred in a single day, and b) President John Fitzgerald Kennedy was assassinated by his own Secret Service chauffeur because he was going to reveal \"the truth about UFOs.\" Again, it seemed to me per- sonally that even internal logic was absent from many of the statements. On the one hand, there is a fawning before uniformed authorities like Gen. Douglas MacArthur and Admiral Ros- coe Hillenkoetter, whenever their words can be used in support of a particular conspiracy or theory; and on the other hand, there is a complete dis- dain of official statements by authori- ties of similar standing when those pronouncements do nof substantiate same. I'm reminded of the line uttered in frustration by Joker Jack Nicholson in the movie, Batman: \"Where does he get those wonderful toys?\" Where do Lear and Cooper, among others, get their wonderful inside knowledge? How do they know all these things? Was Cooper a covert secretary on the staff of the Bilderburg or some other secret society at the apex of MUFON UFO Journal, No. 256, August 1989"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"world power? Is he personally privy to the private thoughts of the Trilateral Commission? Inquiring minds like mine want to know. Because if the foun- tainhead of their secret sources is one Paul Bennewitz, Moore convincingly demolished whatever pretension to authority it might have once had. Maybe, like the Joker, Cooper and Lear will yet have the last laugh. But from this corner, anyway, that appears highly doubtful. Jungle UFOs It is a jungle out there, but in rare cases that can be a distinct advan- tage, claimed Jacques Vallee, author of Dimensions, which was recently released in a Ballantine paperback. Vallee took the analogy literally, tra- veling to Brazil to investigate a series of anomalous reports involving light beams, physical injuries and even deaths. The main advantage is that any luminous phenomena in the night sky is unlikely to be attributable to the usual contaminants found in more industrialized countries like the Uni- ted States and Europe. For the most part, there simply are no airplanes, helicopters, weather balloons, or even electrical lighting to contend with. The interior of Brazil is predominantly jungle. Roads are few, and travel among the locals is most often accom- plished by river vehicles or on foot. Vallee's on-site investigations, under- taken over two weeks in July of last year, centered in a region of the Braz- ilian interior known as Parnarama. Former Journal editor Bob Pratt was credited with having laid the ground- work by his own journeys into the remote region. UFOs are known locally by the name \"chupa.\" Because of native hunting habits, it is not unusual for the heads of households and other potential witnesses (or vic- tims) to be active at night, even in iso- lated areas without lighting. Meager earnings have to be supplemented by living off the land, which entails a good deal of fishing and hunting for deer and other mammals. The most common practice is to string a ham- mock across an animal trail and wait for the victim to arrive. Unfortunately, UFOs seem to employ' the same technique, with the hapless native MUFON UFO Journal, No. 256, August 1989 In one case a hammock-hunter died unexpectedly after a light was seen in the same area. Two circu- lar, reddish-purple marks were found on his neck, about two inches below one ear. hunters often the prey. A typical encounter of the kind investigated by Vallee begins with the sighting of a distant light, as in the case of Jose Morais da Silva and his 10-year-old son. The light, sometimes as intense as lightning, comes closer and emits a beam of illuminosity that seems to probe for humans like a hovering searchlight. In the da Silva case, he and his son sought shelter from an object which landed on the embankment above them. A sound like a car door slamming was heard, followed by voices that spoke an uni- dentifiable language. \"At 6:00 a.m.,\" da Silva said, \"it went away, and we found large footprints where it had landed.\" When struck directly by the beam of light, da Silva felt an intense pain, and was unable to open his eyes. The pain remains present, four years after the sighting. Long duration encounters seem to be common. In the case of a prospec- tor named Manuel, the victim was pursued by a light beam almost the entire night, from 10 p.m. until five in the morning. Manuel reported a weak feeling when struck by the beam, and a foul odor which affected him even more than the light, penetrating like burning sulphur, and forcing him to continually clear his throat. What saved him, he thought, was covering his nose with a piece of cloth. Cha- racteristically, the object itself was refrigerator-shaped, emitting a beam of red light out of the middle of one side. Vallee also investigated two deaths that may be associated with chupas. In one case a hammock-hunter died unexpectedly after a light was seen in the same area. Two circular, reddish- purple marks were found on his neck, about two inches below one ear. In the second instance, though, the deceased hunter was accompanied by a companion who witnessed a beam of light, and dove for cover. The vic- tim fell out of his hammock, breaking an arm, but his body was also found to bear similar purple-red circles. Val- lee indicated that similar reports of lights and beams continued in the area until very recently. Apparently in response to Moore's revelations the night before, Vallee also offered some pointed advice for ufologists in general. \"MUFON would do well,\" he said, \"to initiate a policy of only talking to people who claim to actually have seen aliens, not to friends-of-friends, or friends-of-friends- of-friends. This would do a great deal to cut down on the clutter and confu- sion.\" It would also help sort out sources from pseudosources, and re- duce some of the rumors running rampant. In fact, this is precisely why courts of law do not allow \"hearsay\" testimony as evidence. Mars Face On the Cydonia Mensa region of the planet Mars sits what is either a geological Rorshach test or a genuine extraterrestrial artifact of staggering proportions and implications. What is now known as the famous \"Mars face\" was originally discovered by Dr. Tobias Owen on frame 35A72, taken by the Viking planetary probe of 1976. The same prominent feature is also shown on frame 70A13, taken at a slightly closer range of 1724 kilome- ters, or 1070 miles. Much speculation has since cen- tered on whether the configuration is natural or artificial. Like Hobson's choice and pregnancy, the case is clearly either or, all or none. Those who line up against the face being an artificial structure, like Carl Sagan, have orthodox history and distance on their side. Those like Dr. John E. Brandenberg, a theoretical plasma physicist, also have distance on their side, along with informed speculation and enthusiasm, which is at least con- tagious if not convincing.

Unlike many theories in ufology, the Cydonian hypothesis, the subject of Branden- burg's talk, is at least falsifiable, or testable. In fact, to my way of think- ing, it will probably be proved conclu- sively one way or the other within the next decade, so why the rush to judgment?

SUPPORT UFO RESEARCH 12 MUFON UFO Journal, No. 256, August 1989"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Close Encounter At Elizabeth By Walter Webb Webb authors our monthly Night Sky column. Early in 1989 I had given a copy of a magazine article (containing an account of my Buff Ledge Camp, Vermont, CE-IV investigation) to the Exhibits Secretary at the Boston Museum of Science, Nancy DiCiac- cio. Nancy formerly was the Planeta- rium's Administrative Assistant; I am the Planetarium Assistant Head. Exhibit Designer Deborah Sovinee, 35, hap- pened to glance at the article and tell. Nancy about her own UFO close encounter when she was 17 and living in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Nancy called my extension March 21, but I was unavailable. The next day Planet- arium Secretary Jeanette Alabiso not- ified me about the call. I called Nancy and then contacted Debbie. An inter- view was arranged for March 23. After our meeting, the witness agreed to get further details from her mother (who also observed the UFO) and to fill out a MUFON form. I questioned Debbie again on March 28 and 31. On April 15 I called Debbie's mother, now living in Toms River, New Jersey, and obtained information which both confirmed and altered her daughter's remembered version of the experience. At the same time I also wrote the Elizabeth Daily Journal, asking for a copy of the news story allegedly reporting the UFO. When I didn't hear from the newspaper's librarian after a month, I telephoned May 16. The librarian said he hadn't received my letter. But he promised to check his files for the UFO story and then call me back the next day. However, I failed to hear from him. I called again May 19 and left my address and telephone numbers with someone. Still no response. Finally, on June 12 I was able to contact the librarian again. He reported that he had conducted a search of his files from April to July 1971 and hadn't MUFON UFO Journal, No. 256, August 1989 found any news item relating to the sighting. Mrs. Servilla returned her com- pleted MUFON form May 17. The fol- lowing account incorporates the tes- timony of both Deborah Sovinee and her mother, Stella Servilla. The Encounter Both women recalled that the sight- ing happened around the middle of May 1971 and about the middle of the week at a time when Debbie attended a livesaving class. (This would place the date around either May 12 or 19.) Mrs. Stella Sovinee (now Servilla) had driven her daughter home from the class at the Y and had pulled into their driveway at 5 Gibson Place, Eli- zabeth, New Jersey (1970 pop. 112,654). The time was about 10:30 p.m. (EDT), according to Debbie, and \"after nine or after ten,\" according to her mother. The Sovinee home was located in the middle of a short, dead-end sub- urban street about a block long, with five houses on each side. (Although both witnesses agreed that the street ran approximately north and south, Mrs. Servilla implied that their resi- dence stood on the west side of the street while Debbie thought it was on the east side.) The two observers recalled that it was a warm, clear night. Debbie believed others on the street were outdoors at the time and assumed that there were at least three or four other possible eyewitnesses to the anomalous event, including neighbors sitting on the porch across the street. Her mother stated that she didn't recall if there were others outside and was unaware of any other witnesses to the event on their street. As Debbie and her mother got out of the car and walked toward the front of their house, they were stunned to see a strange object hovering nearly overhead. \"I was almost in shock,\" Mrs. Servilla asserted. At first they thought it was a blimp but quickly ruled that out. According to Debbie, it was an \"absolutely soundless\" oval (not per- fectly circular) object encircled by a central row of many, small, round, white, very bright lights. She des- cribed seeing a pulse of light moving along the row of lights, brightening each source in the row sequentially. The witness referred to this pulse as a \"chase light.\" Mrs. Servilla's recollection differed somewhat. She thought the object mas circular with a row of many bluish-white, round lights around the middle which were blinking on and off like the lights on a Christmas tree. She also said she perceived a faint sound coming from the UFO, like a \"faint motor\" or the hum of an air-conditioner. Both agreed that the object's lights were bright enough to illuminate and reveal its outline. The witnesses said the UFO appeared to be at a low height off to one side of their roof. (Debbie indicated an elevation angle of perhaps 60°.) Dimensions I asked each observer to attempt to estimate the object's height, using their three-story house as a known size marker. Debbie guessed that it might have been about 75 to 100 feet above the ground. Mrs. Servilla thought it was perhaps twice as high as the house (or around 60 feet up), although she felt very uncertain. When requested to hold a quarter at arm's length in order to estimate the UFO's apparent size (an almost impossible and perhaps meaningless exercise 18 years after the actual event), Debbie guessed that the coin was possibly \"1/5 or 1/6\" the size of the object. This means that the UFO 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"might have subtended 12.5 to 15°, or approximately 25 feet across if 100 feet above the observers. However, if the object actually were higher than estimated, say 200 feet (assuming the same angular diameter), the UFO's true size becomes approximately 45 to 50 feet, matching Debbie's descrip- tion — \"bigger than a helicopter\" or \"about the same size as my house.\" Mrs. Servilla would not hazard a guess as to the object's true dimensions. After hovering for perhaps \"a min- ute or two,\" according to Debbie's mother, the UFO moved off toward the southwest in a \"side-to-side, snake- like\" motion and was gone within seconds. Debbie herself had great difficulty in recalling the precise nature of the motion and the sequence of events. Before she telephoned her mother, she thought she had remembered first seeing the UFO in motion, racing from one end of the street to the other and then halting near her house. But now she agrees with her mother's version that it was station- ary at first. Debbie, however, recol- lected the wavy departure path differ- ently. She said the object proceeded to move across the street and back again in a \"figure 8\" before accelerat- ing northward on a straight course, vanishing from sight within a second. Afterwards, Mrs. Servilla said she called the police to report the sight- ing. The police did state that they had received a few other calls but explained the object as an advertising blimp. The next day the Elizabeth news- paper, according to Debbie's mother, confirmed that \"people had seen something in the sky, possibly an advertising blimp.\" Mrs. Servilla said she was familiar with both advertising blimps and night ad planes, and the object was neither. However, the librarian of the Elizabeth Daily Jour- nal was unable to find any story relat- ing to the sighting. Debbie didn't recall any media publicity about the sighting, either in the newspaper or on radio or television. Evaluation Based upon my interviews with Deborah Sovinee and her mother, I find no compelling reasons to doubt that the New Jersey UFO encounter occurred approximately as described by the witnesses. The variations in the testimonies of the two observers are to be expected in view of the 18 years of elapsed time since the actual observation. The aerial event described in this report bears no similarity to any IFO that this investigator is aware of, including the advertising blimp or night ad aircraft referred to above. The unknown object's appearance and flight behavior place it in the UFO category. I believe this episode should be classified as an unknown. I also assign it a Paranet/Hynek Strangness/ Probability Rating of S4/P4 (Strange and not conforming to known princi- ples/Credible and sound). Deborah Sovinee lives at 687 North Gary Street, Brockton, Massachusetts. Mrs. Stella Servilla resides at 66 Vir- gin Islands Drive, Toms River, New Jersey. Majestic & Moore: Not Guilty! Sider is a French ufologist. The following article was translated by Dr. Thomas E. Bullard of Bloo- mington, Indiana. The ongoing saga of MJ-12 has become one of the most controversial issues in UFO history. Through the 1980s William Moore, Stanton Fried- man and Jaime Shandera have accumu- lated evidence for government inter- est in UFOs at the highest levels, and government coverups with equally high-reaching sanction. The most spec- tacular revelation came late in 1984 when Shandera received in the mail from unknown sources a briefing document allegedly prepared for Presi- dent-Elect Eisenhower. This 1952 document made matter- of-fact reference to two crashed sau- cers in government hands, one from Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947, the 14 By Jean Sider other from the Texas-Mexico border in 1950. Bodies of beings described as \"extra-terrestrial biological entities\" were recovered and in government hands. A need for strictest secrecy was stressed. Almost as remarkable as the text itself was the introduction of Majestic-12, a top-secret intelli- gence group responsible only to the president and manned by twelve lead- ing military and scientific figures of the day. One member's name stands out as especially unexpected by ufol- ogists — Donald Menzel, the Harvard astronomer who was archenemy of UFOs throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Moore published a reproduc- tion of the MJ-12 document in the MUFON UFO Journal No. 231 (July 1987), pp. 11-13. If valid, this document was the \"smoking gun\" of proof that the government had known and hidden the truth about UFOs for thirty years. But was the document valid? Enter Philip J. Klass with two articles in Skeptical Inquirer (Winter 1987-88, Spring 1988, pp. 137-146, 279-289). He argues that the documents are fakes, and cites as one piece of evidence an implausible mixture of civilian and mil- itary styles in the format for dates. \"By a curious coincidence,\" he says, the style is the same one used by Moore in dating all his correspon- dence with Klass. By implication, Moore faked the documents. There are indeed important clues which hint that a fraud has been per- petrated, but more probably by a government agency than by Moore. To be frank, I cannot give formal proof of this charge, but I will set forth the evidence and let readers judge for themselves.

September 24, 1947 P. 1 p. 2 p. 3 P. 4 // p. 5 p. 6 p. 7, Truman memo consists of three anomalies of style in the writing of dates included in the MJ-12 document. I reproduce those dates above in order of their appear- ance in the text, taking care to dupli- cate their arrangement and punctuation: Note carefully these dates. Only the last is different in style because it begins with the month, a standard but not systematic military practice during the 1947-1952 era. All others begin with the day, a practice which was less current but not extraordinary. Page 7 is not a part of the MJ-12 document itself, but a note signed by President Truman. As evidence for this conclusion, the typewritten letters are those of another machine — notice that among the capital letters, for example, the downstroke of the \"M\" is lower in the Truman memo than in the MJ-12 document — and the stamp \"TOP SECRET EYES ONLY\" likewise differs on the two pieces. So in principle, and until proved otherwise, the Truman memo can be taken as authentic because no convincing suspicion to the contrary has surfaced. Returning to the dates in the MJ-12 document proper, note that not only do they all begin with the day, but they are all furnished with a comma after the month, whenever the month is written in its entirety. This form of writing is normal in Canada, but atyp- ical of American style. In America, when the date begins with the day, a comma is not placed after the month. MUFON UFO Journal, No. 256, August 1989 This is the first significant anomaly. Next, notice a zero placed before the day digit, whenever it is less than ten. The military style of writing for messages during this era included a zero, the day being followed by hours and minutes; but the style for letters was quite different. Whenever they were drafted, this peculiarity was not required. This is the second signifi- cant anomaly. An informer called these two flies in the ointment to the attention of Philip Klass, but I have found yet another: See how all the dates on page 6 consist of a date with the year abbre- viated. In place of the 19, there is an apostrophe. Yet I have not found this manner of writing the year among the declassified documents of which I have photocopies in my files. Recall now the three peculiarities of style noted in the form of dates writ- ten in the MJ-12 document divulged by Moore: • A comma after the month. • A zero before the day when it is less than ten. • An apostrophe in place of the 19 in the year. Now, as Klass's informer specified at the time of his denunciation, these uncustomary forms of writing turn up again in dates on letters from Moore. But there is a hitch. And the \"hitch\" occurs thrice. I can furnish the proof, because I have had occa- sion to exchange mail with William Moore, who seems to me to be more a victim than a culprit in this affair. I possess two personal letters from Moore, where the dates and punctua- tion are written as follows: 12 Sep- tember, '87 and 02 DEC. '87. Klass has presented letters from Moore with the dates drafted as fol- lows, punctuation included (Skeptical Inquirer 12/2, p. 143): 14 May, 1984, 06 June, 1985, and 17 June,1985. I also possess a copy of an older letter from Moore, addressed to Mr. Charles W. Hinkle, Director of F.O.I, and Security Review, Office of the Asst. Secy, of Defense, Washington, D.C., typed with comma like this: 21 January, 1981 (and another date in the text, as follows): 30 December, 1980. In light of the dates in letters from Bill Moore, I will make the following statements: • He puts the day before the month. • He puts a comma after the month. • He places a zero before the fig- ure for the day when less than ten. • He sometimes abbreviates the year, using an apostrophe in place of figures for the century (19). Klass does not seem to have had any let- ters including this arrangement, which does not appear in the examples cited until 1987. However, I have disco- vered that Moore made use of this style earlier, in the 1982 ' MUFON Symposium proceedings. On page 85 he writes: May '81 - May '82. Another example can be found in the 1983 MUFON proceedings, page 100: (Jan '82); in those for 1985, at the bottom of page 132: (or '49), and at the top of page 133: ('40 or early '50s). My American colleagues doubtlessly can find other examples. These examples show that the writ- ten form most typical of Moore was evident throughout many years in his writings, even before he divulged the Majestic 12 document in 1985. As a result, this form could be noted easily enough by a forger intending to imitate it. I will offer the proof to show that Moore's style was copied deliberately by a third party, and that the deed was not Moore's. In copying the writ- ten form of the California researcher, the eager forger became quite care- 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"less and committed two blunders which definitively acquit Bill Moore. Judge for yourself: • When the month is typed in three capital letters on page 6, the forger does not put a period after. Moore does. • When the year is typed in two figures preceded by an apostrophe on pages 6, the forger puts a period after. Moore does not. Forger: 30 NOV '47. Moore: 02 DEC. '87 Here is proof that perfection does not exist even in matters of fraud. Set-Up? In order to take advantage of the two main characteristics of Moore's style in dating his letters, it would be necessary to have read many of them in order to establish whether this style is accidental or recurrent. It would be all the more necessary because the zero placed before the figure for days less than ten can be found only in letters typed between the 1st and 9th of each month, which, in terms of proportions, reduces the opportunities to only nine out of 30 per month. I am willing to bet that the corres- pondent most honored by letters from Moore is a major governmental agency, either the Defense Depart- ment or the U.S. Air Force. I myself have carried on more correspondence with these organizations than with private researchers. Now, it is reaso- nable to suppose that Moore's inves- tigations of the Roswell crash proved especially embarrassing to the credi- bility of the official position on the UFO problem, so someone employed by this governmental agency might have decided to discredit this research- er. This person was then able to use Moore's letters to that agency in order to copy the style, notably the written form of the dates so peculiar to Moore, and contrive a phony doc- ument accordingly. To return to Philip Klass. It is cur- ious to note that this famous Ameri- can debunker was the first to denounce the two principal faults in the dates of the document. He did not make this discovery personally; an informer set him on the track. This informer has 16 taken care to protect his identity. It is quite reasonable to imagine that the denouncer just might be the imitator himself. The fact that he gave this con- fidence to Klass, always the grand denier of the UFO phenomenon, is yet another indication of his intentions. Klass has clamored long and loud that the MJ-12 documents are \"clumsy counterfeits.\" The speed with which he responded to Moore's announcement, demonstrates as well that he really did not have the time to properly research his debunking, compose a file, draft a well-substantiated text, and send it to the editor of the Skeptical Inquirer. The first part of his article was published at the end of November 1987 (vol. 12, no. 2), whereas Moore released his docu- ment at the end of June that same year. It should be noted that according to Stanton Friedman, Klass does practi- cally no research at the major national libraries, despite the fact that he lives in Washington, D.C., where they are plen- tiful! Moreover, Jim Moseley in his bul- letin Saucer Smear (vol. 34, no. 7, p. 2) suspects that Klass borrowed largely from the file compiled by British research- er Christopher Allan in writing the Skeptical Inauirer article cited above. Klass credits Allan with pointing out the comma and zero anomalies (p. 140), but Allan's familiarity with Moore's style is doubtful, since in that same issue of Saucer Smear Allan asks the readers to check their files and report any findings on date format. Another important point: Before the MJ-12 document was divulged, no one in the ufologjcal community knew that Dr. Donald Menzel, who denied the UFO phenomenon in three books (the third in collaboration with Ernest Taves) held a Top Secret Ultra security clear- ance with the U.S. Navy (see Interna- tional UFO Reporter Jan.-Feb. 1988, p. 21-22). A forger among private research- ers (Klass included) would never have had the idea of including Menzel in a highest-security group, all things consi- dered. Therefore the imitator had inside information, and had to be \"the right man in the right place.\" He must have contrived his fake document starting with a grain of truth, such as the name of Dr. Menzel. Conclusions A review of the findings shows the following: • The MJ-12 document revealed by Moore is a put-up job by a governmen- tal agency to mislead the California researcher, debunk MJ-12 (a name which had appeared in two other doc- uments prior to its becoming known to Moore), torpedo the activities of Ameri- can ufologists and ridicule them in the eyes of the media and public. • The group Majestic-12 seems to have had an actual existence. The Truman memo, typed with another machine, a normal date style, and pro- vided with different classification stamps, can provide the proof. Mention of MJ- 12 also figures in the Cutler memo, which has been authenticated by analy- sis of the original onionskin paper. The paper belongs to the right era, and has not been manufactured since the begin- ning of the 1970s (my information comes by a phone call from J.L. Rivera in New York in 1988, who found out from Moore). Furthermore, I have obtained two confirmations of the exist- ence of this ultra-top-secret group dedi- cated to the UFO problem. One comes first-hand from a retired American scientist, the other second-hand from a friend, himself an official, who received the information from a high-ranking mil- itary officer still on active duty. So, in ascertaining the truth about the MJ-12 document, I have been able to establish not only that it is most likely a fake, at least in part, but that Majestic-12 had an actual existence, despite the misleading clues. Here the issue stands, barring further evidence to the contrary. Now to close with an anecdote: One of my friends, a still-active scientist, has attested to me that whenever Dr. Men- zel participated in a congress of astro- physicists, he had a habit of drawing during the speeches. All these drawings showed flying saucers and small huma- noids with large heads, provided with whimsical details — ladders against the saucer, antennas on the heads of the beings, etc. One would think that Dr. Menzel must have been especially fasci- nated by the problem of UFOs and extraterrestrials. Were these drawings merely a visual way of letting off steam, or the minor eccentricity of an absent- minded professor?

A good deal of the talk, however, consisted of a question-and-answer session conducted by Moore himself. Among the sixteen questions he asked and answered was, \"What do I think of Whitley Strieber and his claims of being a UFO abductee?\" \"At first,\" Moore said, \"I was highly skeptical and admittedly somewhat jealous of Whitley.\" But in the pro- cess of getting to know Strieber bet- ter, in order to assess things for him- self, Moore confided, \"he has earned my respect, my admiration and my friendship ... He has come very close to the truth in a number of ways, and, although still somewhat baffled by his experiences, has found a very acceptable way of accommodating them into his life.\" Moreover, \"if one makes a conscious effort to remove Whitley's emotional reactions and takes a good hard look at the remaining core of information, the result is insight into what gives every appear- ance of being a real situation.\" Moore concluded his remarks about Strieber by saying that \"in any event, I certainly wouldn't dismiss this man too lightly. We're going to hear a lot more from him before it's all over.\" Several salvos have been heard already, or soon shall be. The movie of Communion, starring Christopher Walken as Strieber, comes to the silver screen either later this summer or early fall. In the meantime, Strieber and associates have instituted the Communion Foundation.

Put- nam's Sons, New York, 319 pages, $18.95. With all due respect, it did not impress this reader as one of Strieb- er's more gripping tales. Or maybe I'm simply jaded from having read too many UFO books. The title, of course, refers to Majic or Majestic-12, the alleged superse- cret, government-military UFO cover- up agency alluded to in the \"presiden- tial briefing\" papers mailed anonymous- ly to LA TV producer Jaime Shandera, a colleague of both Moore and Stan- ton Friedman. The point of origin for the book's plot is the Roswell Incident itself, and in fact, Strieber visited the area in Moore's company, and was able to interview some of the major witnesses involved. Strange, then, that with an on-site background briefing and his own experiences as an abductee to draw on, Majestic remains oddly anorexic, not quite fully fleshed out, as it were. Plot and treatment are a composite, composed of different measures of fact and fiction, including official quotes from several former UFO players on one hand, and informed speculation on the other. The story itself is told in Creatures From Space? Well, They Have Antennae Sightings of unidentified flying ob- jects have been blamed on everything from bright stars and meteors to air- planes and falling space debris. But now a biophysicist has con- cluded that some unidentified flying objects glowing in the night sky could be swarms of migrating insects. \"A lot of night sightings of U.F.O.'s are just lit-up insects riding storm fronts.\" the scientist, Phillip Calla- han, said in a statement issued re- cently by the American Institute of Physics. Dr. Callahan, a retired re- search professor at the University of Florida and a biophysics consultant in Gainesville. Flu., said the storms generate electrical fields that can cause insect antennae to glow. A study comparing spruce bud- worm moth migrations with U.F.O. sightings seems to support the hy- pothesis, he said. Many insects mi- grate after dusk\", riding a storm front, uflcn in saucer-shaped swarms. A clump of migrating budworins can extend (or 5 or 10 miles, with insects on the outer edge flying back into the swarm, giving a ha/y outline. Charles Waller In the course of his researcn on crop pesis, Dr. Callahan found that when insects were placed in an elec- trical field, ihe spines in the antennae would light up. He likened the effect to St. Elmo's fire, a flaming electrical discharge sometimes seen around a church steeple or ship's must on a stormy night In a swarm of insects, the scionusl s.ud, this effect produces an aura of blue, gieen and yellow light. But Philip J Klass. who has written several books on ihe U.F.O. phenome- non, saul insects might explain \"only one out uf a thousand\" sightings.

The latter charac- ter's admissions and well placed career allow the reader an inside view of the retrieval of the original Roswell object, the subsequent cover-up, and the formation of MJ-12 itself. They also allow us to meet such conspiratorial UFO luminaries as Roscoe Hillen- koetter, James Forrestal and Harry Truman, who emerge as little more than cardboard cut-outs, though they may look imposing enough in the cinematic version of Majestic, if there is one. Forrestal, for example, would seem to have been any fictioneer's dream gift horse: \"Secretary of Defense Learns Secret About UFOs and Jumps Out Window!\" Yet, his secretive sui- cide lapses in passing. And instead, we are treated to the exploits of Stone himself. A sense of verisimilitude is sought by the extensive quotation of \"official\" government documents, including an \"Intelligence Estimate on Flying Disk Motives,\" which repeats two widely discredited stories in the literature of anomalies: the disappearance of David Lang and the supposed 19th century encounter of one \"Robert Loosely\" (the actual perpetrator of this book- length hoax was an English physicist) with an alien robot probe. In a work of fiction, why rely on such discre- dited \"facts,\" when they could have just as easily been fabricated out of whole cloth? Instead of bolstering a sense of reality, their presence deflates one's willing suspension of belief like pin-holes in the fabric of a balloon. Abductions occur with unhistorical abandon, too, but it's still not clear to this reviewer what Strieber means to imply about their ultimate nature. If they are the product of some sort of species of avenging angel, as Strieber seems to indicate, their meaning still remains murky after a reading of Majestic. On the one hand they appear to dispense a sort of cosmic justice; on the other they seem intent on a revelation of personal signifi- cance or enlightenment. Either way, these omniscient angels emerge as oddly impotent and ineffective, while 18 Next UFO landing zone: your backyard.

Are they con- strained by the rules of the game, or the nature of the unsubmitting beast, or a combination of both? After the imaginative success Strie- ber had in breathing alien life forms to life in Wolfen and The Hunger, the allegedly real aliens of Majestic are anything but. At their center, behind their fascinating almond eyes, rings a hollow resonance. If they are sup- posed to be a mirror held up to humanity, as sometimes suggested, the reflection found in Majestic is a pale one indeed. Maybe Strieber himself was con- strained by what he knows. Or maybe the problem of portraying angelic, or near angelic, life forms is an almost insurmountable one, as even the critics of Paradise Lose have been forced to concede. Lucifer, or Satan, the Prince of Light, is simply more psychologically interesting than his heavenly counterparts. Finally, if I may be so sanctimon- ious and presumptuous at a single stroke, a warning. With Majestic, Whitley Strieber firmly anchors his yacht to that bobbing buoy known collectively as MJ-12. Even if one should sink and the other swim, it could become increasingly difficult for society at large to distinguish between the two. And society, after all, as Jung noted, has accepted, if not necessarily understood, the awesome implications of the hydrogen bomb. So the social body as it is can take or leave the revelations embodied by the authenticity of MJ-12. It's the inau- thenticity of MJ-12 and its conse- quences I'm worried about. And the society likely to be affected is a lot MJ-12, continued smaller than that which makes up McLuhan's global village. It is, in fact, a society of one or two, more or less. The reader can analyse this surpris- ing situation for himself, taking into ac- count the facts as he now knows them, to draw the right conclusions. Unless our dear colleagues, the social psychologists, have a slant on the Menzel mystery and go to great lengths to explain it to us from every psychological perspective, doubtless with two or three hundred references to Freud, Jung and other great thinkers, we must assume that the behavior of the celebrated astrophysi- cist was normal.

An Alien Harvest is not just another book or story about cattle mutilations, but a true account of allegedly horrifying events of not only the mutilation of cattle, but also pos- sibly humans. Other animals such as dogs, cats, sheep, goats and the like have also been reportedly found with stripped skin, sexual organs removed along with eyes, tongues and jaws. Occasionally, strange lights are ob- served before, during and after the discovery of the mutilated animals. The contents of this book do not deal solely with mutilations, but uses them as a stepping stone to a more complicated, highly intriguing story of alien intervention into human life. There are numerous photos of the mutilated cattle, accounts of alien confrontations, copies of alleged U.S. Government documents ranging in context from confirmed contact with EBEs (Extraterrestrial Biological Enti- ties), to intrusion of air space and landings at U.S. Government installa- tions, to an outstanding and compell- ing report of a statement about a Top Secret/Majic Government Document ... Project Aquarius. Project Aquarius explains all of the projects related to the government's involvement with EBEs. Also included in the appendix of the book are 71 pages of transcript dealing with two different hypnotic regression sessions conducted by Dr. Leo Sprinkle, formerly the Director of the Division of Counseling and Test- ing at the University of Wyoming, Laramie, Wyoming.

Buck Fitzgerald and Mase Carney gave the following des- cription of the event: \"This flying disc, which was about 24 feet in diameter, whizzed past us going about 300 miles per hour. It crash-landed and two little men jumped out and started running when they saw us. The men looked human but they were very small — like dwarfs. We chased them over a sand dune but lost them. I don't know where they went.\" The two prospectors allowed that with a temperature of 138 degrees, it was too hot to chase the little men for any great distance. *** THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO — August 1954: On the first, park offi- cials in Sequoia-Kings National Park, California, watched as Air Force interceptors pursued a huge disc- shaped craft estimated to be 1000 feet in diameter. Three Air Force jets pursued a large UFO over Moscow, Idaho on the night of the ninth. It was described by Ground Observer Corps observers as a glowing disc-shaped craft 200 feet in diameter. On the 19th, a small, round object, flaming like red hot iron, descended from the sky over East New Haven, Connecti- cut, at a high rate of speed., leveled off, streaked past cars and pedestri- ans, pierced a metal billboard, angled sharply upward, streaked over the trees and out of sight. Investigators found copper deposits on the billboard. Two women, Mrs. Aasta Solvang and her sister Edit Jacobsen, said they not only had a close look at a spacecraft, they talked to its \"dark- skinned, long-haired\" occupant near 20 Mofjell, in northern Norway on the 20th. This was the sisters' account: \"We were picking berries when sud- denly a dark man with long hair, but otherwise looking very much like an ordinary human being, came out from behind some bushes. We were fright- ened at first but the man appeared very friendly, and stepped toward us.\" One of them addressed him in Eng- lish, French, German, and Norwe- gian. \"He didn't seem to understand a word.\" The stranger then attempted to communicate by drawing \"circles and what looked like heavenly bodies\" on a piece of paper. The occupant finally led them to his craft which looked like \"two deep table saucers sandwiched together rim-to-rim,\" about 15 feet across. The man opened a hatch and crawled into the disc. Moments later the craft \"rose from the ground and began rotating, first slowly, then increasingly faster.\" Then, suddenly, it disappeared at an \"incred- ible speed.\" *** THIRTY YEARS AGO — August 1959: A former Navy pilot was flying his Cessna 170 from Hobbs to Albu- querque, New Mexico on the 13th when he noticed that his Magnesyn electric compass was revolving instead of indicating the course of his aircraft. Thinking the Magnesyn must be \"hay- wire,\" he looked at the standard magnetic compass. \"It was spinning so crazily I couldn't read it,\" the pilot reported. A moment later he was startled to see three oval-shaped craft in close echelon formation pass direct- ly in front of the Cessna. They were gray in color and identical in shape, like two bowls rim-to-rim, but with bottoms rounded instead of flat. The pilot estimated their diameter at about eight feet. Since the craft were cir- cling the plane at nearly 250 mph, no other details could be noted, except that they left a short, wispy tail. As the strange vehicles circled the Cessna, the Magnesyn compass con- tinued to revolve, precisely indicating the vehicle's bearing. Holding the same tight formation, the unknown devices finished another circle, pass- ing in front and then disappearing to the rear. The Magnesyn then came to rest near its original heading, and the standard magnetic compass finally stopped its \"crazy spinning\" and returned to normal. Upon landing at Kirtland Air Force Base, Albuquerque, the pilot was \"hustled to an office and interrogated for about two hours by an Air Force major, the UFO Officer at the field.\" The major told the pilot that \"if anything unusual happened, if he had any unusual illness in the next six months, to get to a government hospital right away.\" The Air Force, the major said, would take care of him. A strange occurrence was seen off Prince Rupert, British Columbia, Can- ada, on the 27th by two ship captains homeward bound from Alaska to Seattle, Washington. A pillar of blind- ing light plunged straight downward from the night sky, said Captain Otis D. Treiber of the cruise yacht Sea Otter. It appeared just as the watch was about to change, he said, and Captain Arne Monson was beside him in the pilot house. The greenish- yellow light faded, Treiber said, and from its base \"a black disc about a fourth the size of the moon\" hurtled away at right angles. \"It was as if gravity repelled the disc,\" he said. \"It was lighted in front by a crescent- shaped greenish light. There were yel- low streamers of light extending back from the disc.\" The sighting lasted 10- 15 seconds. *** TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO - August 1964: Several adults and one 12-year-old girl observed several hund- red UFOs while driving on Highway 26 near Royal City, Washington, on the sixth. Said one women who stopped her car to watch: \"It was just about sundown.

The little girl in my car screamed, covered her head with her arms and threw herself onto the floor. She and her mother were passengers. For a minute or more the objects were easily visible against the back- ground of brown grass on the moun- tain. \"We sat there spellbound! One sphere came so close that I thought it was going to hit the car. That one landed on the gravel at the side of the road. I turned to look back at the others, but they were gone from sight. The landed sphere also disap- peared. When we first saw them they must have been three or four miles away. It all happened so quickly and they disappeared so fast that we don't really know just what we saw. We do know, though, that after they were gone the sagebrush was still bending back and forth as if it had been raked by a giant comb.\" Four spherical-shaped UFOs were seen near Arlee, Montana, on the night of the 14th by two men cutting wood in the mountains. Earl Johnston and Carmen McClure said they saw the craft come in over the valley from a great distance. One of the spheres came within a mile and a half of their cabin and appeared to be about 500 feet in diameter. They said it was brightly lighted and trailed a blue tail of light behind it. Johnston said the vehicle moved \"back and forth, occa- sionally circling the area\" until 3:30 a.m. the following morning. The craft made no noise as it passed but the men could feel a \"funny vibration, something like a sonic boom without the noise.\" The vehicle joined its three companions and \"slowly left\" the valley. *** FIFTEEN YEARS AGO — August 1974: Three boys playing along the banks of the Coquitlam River at Port Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada, witnessed the landing of a UFO on the 16th. David Bates, 8, Henry Stil- lie, 7, and his 10-year-old brother saw a craft shaped like an inverted dish land in a gravelled area. Mrs. Lola MUFON UFO Journal, No. 256, August 1989 Rogers, a neighbor, who investigated the area the following morning, found two strange black circles on the gravel. The boys said the craft first flew over the river about 7:30 p.m,, then stopped, reversed its course and began descending to the clearing beside the river. They were about 150 feet from the landed vehicle. The three boys said the vehicle made only a buzzing sound as it descended, car- ried no markings and gave off a blast of hot air as it touched down. The cat that David was holding jumped out of his arms, played dead for a while and then \"took off.\" The three witnesses ran away before the craft took off.

I don't know what the hell ...\" Apparent impact of the collision broke a left headlight of the car without denting the cowling or fender, dented the hood near the windshield, broke the windshield and a flasher light on top of the car and sharply bent two flexible-mounted antennae. The path of damage indicated six points of impact in a line varying only a few inches off center. Unusual phenomenon in connec- tion with the incident included the fol- lowing: (1) Deputy Johnson first ob- served a brilliant light which appeared to be stationary, then moved toward him so rapidly (from a distance esti- mated to be about a mile away) that he had no time to anticipate impact. (2) The light was so brilliant that it was painful, causing him to close his eyes, and lit up the whole inside of the car at the time Johnson heard glass breaking. (3) Investigation show- ed that Johnson's car coasted 854 feet from the point where glass from the broken headlight was found to a point where skid marks from locked brakes began. The skid marks covered another 99 feet to where the vehicle came to rest on the road. (4) Examination of Johnson's eyes by Dr. Pinsonneault after the deputy was taken by ambulance to Warren indicated damage similar to \"welder burns.\" An eye specialist at Grand Forks later confirmed similar damage, although there had been rapid improve- ment. (5) A mechanical watch worn by deputy Johnson and an electric clock in his squad car, both of which had been set at 7 p.m. when he started work and checked with the dispatcher, were each 14 minutes slow, indicating they had not been running for that length of time.

Webb August 1989 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Close conjunctions between the crescent Moon, three planets, and the star Regulus occur just after sunset from August 2-5. To be able to observe them will require an unobstructed western horizon and optical aid such as binoculars or a telescope. Even so, it will be exceedingly difficult to glimpse all of the objects. Persons living in the southern states have the best chance as these very low objects will appear somewhat higher there. On the 2nd the Moon, Mercury, Mars, and Regulus mass together. Two evenings later Venus lies near the Moon, and Mercury is very close to Regulus. On the 5th Mercury is extremely near Mars. Saturn (magnitude 0.3) lies low in the SSE at dusk. It moves westward dur- ing the evening hours. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Jupiter (magnitude -2.1), in Gemini, rises in the NE about 1:45 AM in midmonth. Saturn sets in the WSW soon after 2 AM in mid-August. Total Lunar Eclipse: The full moon enters the Earth's shadow on the evening of August 16. Observers in the eastern states are favored for this eclipse since the Moon is above the horizon during the entire event. Totality begins at moonrise along a line through central Montana, western Utah, and Arizona. For far western observers, our satellite already is in total eclipse at moonrise. The Moon first touches the dark umbral shadow at 9:21 PM EDT, is totally hidden from 10:20 to 11:57, and emerges completely from the umbra at 12:56 AM. Meteor Showers: The gibbous Moon sets about 1 AM on the 12th and thereafter the Perseid meteors should put on a fine show. Radiating from near the Cassiopeia/- Perseus border in the NE, these bright, yellow, swift meteors peak before dawn at about 50 per hour. Some of the streaks are spectacular fireballs; about a third of these leave filmy wakes (called trains) lasting up to l l / 2 minutes. Both the Perseids and the slower July Aquarids (coming from the south) dart across the skies in lesser numbers throughout the first half of August.

Dear Editor: It may be argued that, in this busi- ness, nothing is more gratifying than to have one's case findings replicated elsewhere at a later date. 'The November 1984 issue of the Journal published my account (\"Re- Entry Re-Examined\"), co-authored with Harriet Beech, of three anomalous encounters in southern Michigan which were in close time proximity to a re- entered launch vehicle in connection with the Salyut 7 space station. The re-entry and attendant UFO sightings occurred on May 20 of that year. Two of the three reports were by multiple adult witnesses at close range (one within 60 feet). In one of the CEs, as well as the third from farther away, the witnesses described a cigar- shaped vehicle shrouded in a whitish mist. A row of lights was visible along the side of the vehicle. The June 1989 issue of the Journal contains Bob Cribble's summary of a highly similar series of events, entitled \"A Re-Entry With Company,\" con- cerning the December 12, 1987 de- orbiting of a Soviet rocket casing across the central U.S. Of particular note are the witness reports of objects, variously described as cigar- shaped and oblong, surrounded by a \"cloud of mist.\" A row of lights shown along the side. As we speculated five.years ago: \"Is it reasonable that intelligent visitors would have the technological capacity to monitor decaying orbits of space MUFON UFO Journal, No. 256, August 1989 their moment of re-entry? If so, would these visitors have the sociological insight to realize that, in light of a known event such as a satellite re- entry, separate UFO reports are unlikely to be given credence? If this is also correct, might such simultane- ous occurrences become a modus operand! of sorts as the several hundred inoperative satellites now in orbit fall back through the atmos- phere with increasing frequency?\" Those whose case reports I've evaluated over the past two years know well my conservative approach to any sweeping conclusions. In these events, however, the similarities are striking, to say the least. I'd be very interested in receiving case reports from others in connection with space re-entries. — Dan Wright MUFON Investigations 228 S. Fairview Lansing, MI 48912 Dear Editor: Thank you for publishing such an excellent example of academic arm- chair theorizing, \"Toward an Imaginal Interpretation of UFO Abductions,\" by Dr. Kenneth Ring (May 1989). His beautifully elegant language serves to cover his obvious anti-ET biases. His references certainly do not indicate a serious knowledge of hard data. His invention of an \"Imaginal\" world to cover his biases is fascinating as fic- tion, but hardly appropriate for what is presumably non-fiction. What term other than bias can be used to describe such strange state- ments as these: \"The notion that extraterrestrial beings are here among us is one that I personally have not only come to disfavor, but frankly find absurd.\" It would be nice to know what \"among us\" means. Personal opinion ... but surely not a professional, data-based one ... \"UFO phenomena must therefore either be the products of fantasy, delusion or hallucination — or they are real.\" Every large scale scientific study of UFO reports provides a host of explanations, including that some UFOs are astronomical in origin, or aircraft, or balloons, or reentries, etc. ... Just as crime includes theft, murder, rape, battery, etc. No one explanation covers all UFO phenomena. My read- ing of the data for 30+ years says some UFOs represent alien space- craft ... clearly that doesn't mean all UFOs are ET. \"... these episodes (abductions) do nof take place in the physical world as such, even, when they leave physi- cal traces of the effects they obtrude into our space/time continum.\" Pre- sumably this means the 3900 physical trace cases are also caused by imagin- ed \"imaginal\" events. What kind of nonsense is this? Surely a postulating imaginarycauses for physical effects is about as silly as requiring a murdered person to testify at the trial of his 23"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"murderer. The nature of the beast is different. And bringing in more non- sense about a \"psychoid entity\" does nothing to enhance the legitimacy of Again about abductions: \"These experiences also reflect an encounter with a particular imaginal matrix ...\" How clever to again replace reality with a totally imaginary item! \"I don't have to posit some kind of almost inconceivable extraterrestrial invasion to explain it (UFO abduction phenomenon).\" I have no notion of why, except for his own fears and biases, Dr. Ring can't conceive of ET visits to Earth, though his use of the term \"invasion\" certainly suggests psychological difficulty with the con- cept. The fact is, he does indeed posit an almost totally-without-foundation \"Imaginal\" world. A bit of projection here? And speaking of ufologists: \"they themselves are part of the folkloric machine, helping to create a new myth for today's humanity while think- ing that they are working in a scien- tific spirit to solve the UFO question.\" Surely it is Ring who is creating a new myth. My lectures and papers deal with facts and data, not mythology and \"Imaginal\" psychoid entities. Finally: \"...the search for the alien somewhere out in the galaxy must be abandoned anyway for he is not there.\" Ring describes himself as a \"timid academician.\" This statement is a bold one for which he can only provide his bias as a basis. Ring might benefit from discussions with his psychologist. — Stanton T. Friedman New Brunswick Dear Editor: I am writing to respond to two par- ticularly false and misleading conten- tions in Bruce Maccabee's gargantuan Gulf Breeze article in the April 1989 MUFON Journal. (May I ask: Will the 50% rule apply? Will Hall and Smith be given 11 pages to reply?) 1. On pp. 16-17, Bruce dismisses the importance of the \"ghost-demon\" picture by citing an experiment to replicate the photo which he had Ed perform in the aptly-named \"re-crea- tion\" room of Ed's old house. He writes: \"These pictures prove that the original ghost photo could have been 24 an accident and did not have to be taken by double exposure ... The Boyd-Smith argument now loses its importance.\" Actually, the experiment was point- less and proves nothing. The extant \"ghost-demon\" photo was not taken, looking into a glass door or anything like it! It was taken on the opposite side of the room from Ed's replica, looking at a section of the rec room and through an open (solid) door into a laundry room. The anomalous image is superimposed over two hinged sec- tions of a black science project belonging to Ed's son, which are at a 90° angle to each other. If Bruce had consulted Boyd or Smith for informa- tion on camera location, this inane and deceptive exercise could have been avoided. 2. On p. 15, Bruce makes certain flat accusations against the teenager who is the principal source for the \"ultimate prank\" and the \"ghost- demon\" photo allegations. Typically, Bruce recites these libelous charges as gospel when in fact they all rest simply on statements of Ed, who stands to gain a great deal from dis- crediting the boy. There is no evi- dence for any of them! For example, Bruce writes: \"In late 1987 he began to write nasty, demeaning letters to Ed's son (I have seen some of these.)\" I have seen the same letters. All Bruce saw were portions (selected by Ed) of anonymous typewritten let- ters. Yet this is evidence enough for Bruce to publicly defame a fine young man and mislead the MUFON member- ship. I was aghast when I read: \"He also 'keyed' (scratched) the son's car and put sugar in the gas tank. He ended the harassment when Ed threatened to call the police.\" Even Ed himself does not (wisely) go so far. When Jim Moseley included similar charges in the \"Saucer Smear,\" Ed wrote the teen's mother that he had been mis- quoted, that these were only suspi- cions. Moseley quickly retracted. Yet Bruce states these same serious charg- es as facts, not mentioning a much more logical suspect, a former girl friend who was angry with Ed's son for leaving her. At the time of the keying and sugar-in-the-gas-tank incidents, the teen and Ed's son were good friends, both in the high school band. The teen had no car and depended on Ed's son to drive him to parties and home from band practice. The teen has been accused of many things but never stupidity. Re the jealously angle, I have a copy of a yearbook tribute Ed's son paid to the teen, thanking him for keeping Ed's son and his girl friend together (through the teen's help in patching up lovers' quarrels). The MUFON membership's per- ception of the Gulf Breeze affair is largely dependent on Bruce Macca- bee's indefatigable and dauntingly de- tailed investigation. I hope that in this letter I may have raised some (war- ranted) doubts regarding Bruce's im- partiality and good judgement in this case. I would be glad to correspond with anyone wanting documentation or more details.

Mr. Friedman began his work on February 10. Since then, he has spent four days at the Truman Library in Independence, MO; five days at the Eisenhower Library in Abilene, KS; and four days at the National Archives and the Manuscript Division in Washington, DC. Mr. Friedman has talked to several archi- vists, to people associated with the Truman and Eisenhower administra- tions, and to people who knew some of the MJ-12 personalities. At the libraries, he found some interesting information about document formats which is consistent with the format of the Eisenhower briefing document and also with the Cutler-Twining memorandum. Mr. Friedman is becom- ing an expert on certain classified aspects of the Truman and Eisen- hower administrations. So far, he has found nothing to discredit any of the MJ-12 documents; in fact, he has found some supportive information. The Executive Committee of the Fund is also supporting William Moore in further research into the reported crash and retrieval of a UFO outside Roswell, NM, in 1947. Mr. Moore made a trip to contact a potentially valuable source of information related to the Roswell case. He will be mak- ing further trips during the next quar- ter. The results of this investigation will be made available when his research is complete. During this period, David Jacobs, Ph.D., reported on the investigation of stains on certain pieces of cloth associated with the abduction expe- riences of some of the people with whom he has been working. The Fund provided a $1,000 grant for a laboratory analysis of the samples. The lab which did the analytical work was not able to identify the stains; therefore, further work will be neces- MUFON UFO Journal, No. 256, August 1989 sary. Dr. Jacobs is trying to find some laboratory which can work on such small samples. (Mufon provided the $1,000.) The Executive Committee is con- ducting a survey of the news media to determine their opinions about the UFO subject. In the past the Gallup and other polls have asked for the opinion of the general population; however, the committee thought it would be useful to determine the atti- tudes of those who help shape public opinion. Representatives of the Fund also conducted interviews with seven radio stations during this quarter, resulting in nearly seven hours of air time. The committee has proposed creat- ing an award in the name of the late Donald Keyhoe, former head of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP). This award is for $1,000, which would go to the author of the best UFO-related story published or broadcast in the periodic news media — newspaper, magazine, radio or television — in 1989. Any person could submit one or more of his own published articles for evaluation. A panel will be created to evaluate the entries and to make the award. In May, there will be a conference in Connecticut, by invitation only, which will be attended by a number of clinicians in the fields of psychology and psychiatry who have indicated an interest in studying the subject of abductions. The Fund will be support- ing this conference, along with the Mutual UFO Network and the Center for UFO Studies. A major contributor is making this conference possible. In mid-March, the Executive Com- mittee was informed that a Baltimore resident had recorded a very provoc- ative statement made during a \"ham\" radio rebroadcast of the communica-' tions between the space shuttle Dis- covery and Houston ground control. The statement as recorded was as fol- lows: \"Uh, Houston, this is Discovery. We still have that alien spacecraft under (observance?).\" To this there was no response from Houston. (The last word is a bit ambiguous, but the other words — including \"alien space- craft\" are completely clear.) Subse- quent investigations showed that the hams were rebroadcasting \"raw\" com- munications from the spacecraft, rath- er than communications which had been passed first through Houston control. The so-called \"NASA select\" audio channel, which was transmitted by Houston to the press and other interested news media, does not include this statement. This audio tape initiated a search for confirmation that it had, in fact, come from the spacecraft and was not some bizarre hoax by a ham radio operator who transmitted on the same frequency as the Goddard ham station (WA3NAN). The Fund immediately arranged for a voice analysis to determine if the transmis- sion was authentic and if so, which astronaut made the sta.jment. At this writing, the analysis was inconclusive. The Fund for UFO Research is looking for an individual to conduct a study of the possibly changing patt- erns of the basic types of UFO reports. The idea is to compare the relative percentage of Night Lights, Daylight Discs, CE-1, CE-II and CE-III reports during each of the past five years with earlier reports. Interested persons are requested to write to the Fund, giving details of their relevant experience, the infor- mation sources they are able to use, their proposed plan of investigation, the time needed to complete the pro- ject and a breakdown of the expected costs.

MUFON Meetings in New York State The MUFON membership in New York recently held two organizational and informational meetings in their state. The first meeting was held at the YMCA in Auburn on May 20 and was attended by Hal Haglund, Ann Forbes, Donna McLeod, Barb. Foquet, Tom Nesser, Bill and Rhoda Sherwood, State Director Dr. Gary Levine, Dana Schmidt, Neil and Tammy Palumbo and Marc Hutchins. Dana Schmidt (Section Director for Monroe County) assisted with the arrangements. The meeting focused on the establishment of a hotline number and ways to better coordinate UFO reporting in the upstate area. Slides of UFO types were shown. A second meeting took place in New York City on June 3 and featured several speakers. William Knell, a new member from Flushing, discussed sight- ings in New York City and Long Island. He brought with him several photos of UFOs over populated areas. Budd Hopkins reported on the latest in abduc- tion cases and augmented his talk with interesting slides. Antonio Huneeus, the MUFON representative for South America, discussed UFOs in Puerto Rico and other areas of Latin America. Kevin Lammens and Gene Maron, Section Directors from Long Island announced that a new UFO hotline number would be in operation shortly on Long Island. They hoped that their efforts would result in better cooperation among the membership. Dr. Gary Levine, the moderator, showed slides on UFO types. Several members at both meetings expressed interest at holding the MUFON national meeting in New York State.

For those people who were unable to attend this exciting affair, this issue of -the Journal will present some of the memorable highlights. Attendance-wise, the 1989 symposium surpassed all of the previous nineteen except for San Francisco (Burlingame) in 1979. The four unofficial speakers on the Sun- day morning session provided enough -speculation and claims to keep eve- ryone talking, wondering and looking for facts to either confirm or dismiss the controversial material presented. Since MUFON could not support the claims being made, it was treated as an unofficial meeting where the speak- ers had an opportunity to air their stories. The attendees were thus given the privilege of conducting their own evaluations. Further research will disclose whether such claims are fac- tual or science fiction. Dennis Stacy has done an outstanding job of reviewing the official speaker's pres- entations in this issue of the Journal John Lear, Hal Starr and the host committee in Las Vegas are to be commended for their hospitality and friendliness. The meeting facilities at the Aladdin were superb. The MUFON 1989 International UFO Sym- posium Proceedings are now available for $15.00 plus $1.50 for postage and handling. All of the presented papers are published, except for that of Bill Moore and the unofficial speakers (233 pages). While the 1989 symposium is still fresh in our minds, we can start mak- ing plans to travel to Pensacola, Flor- ida for the 1990 extravaganza at the Pensacola Hilton on July 6, 7, and 8. The theme tentatively selected is \"UFOs: The Impact of E.T.

Firmani, State Direc- tor for Massachusetts, recently resign- ed due to new employment opportun- ities requiring more of his personal time. In an organizational change, Edward A. Sanborn of Lowell, MA was elected by the State Section Directors to be the new State Direc- tor replacing Mr. Firmani. In a similar action Morton Schafer, living in Bel- lingham, MA, became the new Assist- ant State Director. Both have received the approval of the MUFON Execu- tive Committee and the Eastern Region- al Director. Ed Sanborn attended the State Directors Training meeting in Las Vegas. Jerry F. Hiers, State Director for Louisiana, is moving back to Califor- nia, creating a vacancy. Walter L. Garner, Jr. (\"Barney\"), presently the Assistant State Director, will assume this responsible position and provide strong leadership. Both men attended State Directors meetings in Eureka Springs and Las Vegas. Mr. Garner is a retired U.S.A.F. Lt. Col. and also recently retired from the faculty at Louisiana State University. John V. Brown, currently the State Director for New Mexico, has asked to resign his post. His nomina- tion of Teresa Brito-Asenap of Albuquerque to fill this position has been approved. Mrs. Asenap has represented New Mexico at each of the last two State Directors Meetings and is anxious to build an energetic investigative team with, available talent- ed people. S. Christopher Early has appoint- ed Larry Hebebrand, a State Sec- tion Director for Muscogee and Chattahoochee Counties, to the addi- tional role of Assistant State Director for Georgia. Mr. Hebebrand has also attended the recent training meetings in Eureka Springs and Las Vegas. Michael M. Dullnig, M.D., a Con- sultant in Psychiatry, has accepted the additional position of State Sec- tion Director for Sacramento and Yolo Counties in Northern California. Karl G.
