Schuessler You still have time to take advantage of the special symposium rates and hotel room rates for the 35 lh annual MUFON In- ternational UFO Symposium in Denver, CO, July 16-18. A special blue registra- tion form is included in this issue for your convenience. We are pleased to an- nounce that Paul Davids will be a featured sympo- sium speaker this year. Paul was the executive producer and co- writer of the Showtime film \"ROSWELL,\" John Schuessler staring Kyle MacLachlan, Dwight Yoakam, and Martin Sheen. It received a Golden Globe nomination for Best TV Picture of 1994. He had a close daylight disc sighting in 1987, along with his two children, that led to his producing several UFO informa- tional videos including: \"DOWN IN ROSWELL,\" \"REPLY TO THE AIR FORCE REPORT ON THE ROSWELL INCIDENT,\" and the \"GOLDEN ANNI- VERSARY UFO BRIEFING FOR THE WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE PIO- NEERS.\" Paul is a graduate of Princeton University and the American Film Insti- tute Center for Advanced Film Studies, and he has been a MUFON member for more than 15 years. His presentation will be called \"Profiles in UFO Courage.\" The thesis of this highly visual presentation is that UFO dis- closure has been like a \"time-release aspi- rin\" in helping the public assimilate the very controversial concept that \"We are not alone!\" Don't miss this chance to meet Paul and see his exciting presentation. Mexican Air Force UFO Encounter The Mexican Air Force UFO Encoun- ter that took place on March 5, 2004 is described in an article by Dwight Connelly on page 4 of this issue and by Stanton Friedman on page 21. This incident re- ceived more television, radio, and news- paper coverage than any other UFO case in the past several years. As a result the MUFON office has been swamped with calls, other UFO reports, and requests for information, clearly showing that the pub- lic is still very interested in this subject.

The most notable was an account of van den Broeke and Talbott observing a crop circle being formed behind the van den Broeke home on Aug. 21, 2001, re- ported in the January, 2002, Journal. Robbert, in conjunction with Talbott, participated in a two-week research project conducted by U.S. parapsycholo- gist Dr. William Roll and the Parapsycho- logical Service Institute three years ago. Dr. Roll was researching whether there might be a human consciousness element involved in the crop circle process, simi- lar to what he had found in poltergeist cases. He was particularly interested in Robbert's ability to anticipate the forma- tion of crop circles. Talbott, a conscientious, reliable, and scientifically-oriented researcher, says she is convinced of Robbert's sincerity and reliability, based on her own observations of unusual occurrences at the van den Broeke home, as well as several years of association with him and his family, in- cluding extended stays at their home. It is in view of this background that the Journal is printing the photo to the right, which normally would not be pub- licized without additional investigation. While this is not the first alleged photo of an alien creature, it may be one of the two most credible ones to date. (Another photo-a video taken in the U.S.-is being studied by specialists, but details have not been released. It, too, shows promise of being authentic.) The current incident began in the early morning hours of May 6, 2004, .when Robbert felt compelled to get his Olympus digital camera and wait in the living room of his parents' home in Hoeven, where the 24-year-old lives. Over a period of about 90 minutes, a smoky, faint mist gradually evolved into an ethreal figure which seemed to be sit- ting on the couch in front of a photo of Robbert's two-year-old nephew. As the image developed, Robbert took photos, June 2004 This is the fifth in a series of photos re- portedly taken by Robbert van den Broeke of Hoeven, Holland, on May 6. Robbert's two-year-old nephew is in the photo in the background. without a flash. (The fifth photo is the one appearing on this page.) During the sessions with the entities, Robbert says there is a strange quiet, some- thing akin to the \"Oz factor\" often described by participants in close encounters. He has also experienced this in crop circles. The next morning, Friday, May 7, about 4 AM, Robbert was again in position, and again the entity appeared and was photo- graphed. (May 7 was also Robbert's 24th birthday, and once again he discovered a crop circle near his home on that day.) The sightings continued on Saturday, May, 8, again about 4 AM, but this time in his bedroom, where he had set up a video camera on a tripod. The smoky, misty image again appeared, gradually as- suming the shape of an alien. As the en- tity took shape he recorded it with the video camera. The figure is shown fading in and out, gradually becoming more structured and somewhat taller and brighter, as though gathering energy. The videotape has been viewed by Robbert's parents, Peter and Nanny; his sisters, Saskya and Madelon; and radio MUFON Journal reporter Bianca Venvught, who charac- terized the video as \"incredible.\" Mr. van den Broeke, a general man- ager at a bank, is accustomed to paranor- mal events in the home, but still finds the photos and video \"real and special.\" He says, \"We are normal people, and 15 years ago we did not know such things are possible.\" He adds that Robbert has shown an in- credible ability to see things, both in the present and in the future, \"and he is al- ways 100% correct. I have no reason not to believe him.\" Other members of the family have re- portedly also seen the entities, though not photographed them. Robbert's sister Madelon and her boyfriend reportedly were awakened one night, seeing an en- tity in the bedroom. Madelon has, in fact, seen so many paranormal events in the home that she treats them matter of factly. Photos of Robbert and other family members often show balls of light surround- ing them, and these balls of light are also associated with the crop circles. Talbott has witnessed these balls of light moving about the van den Broeke home, as well as poltergeist activities in the home. Robbert says he is able to mentally communicate with the beings he is pho- tographing, and that they are not the com- mon grays often described in abduction reports. Although they are not connected with abductions, he says they are respon- sible for crop circles. The entities indicated they will be mak- ing additional appearances, he said, and will eventually make mass appearances before large numbers of individuals. They are concerned about pollution and wars, according to Robbert, and are spiri- tual beings who are totally peaceful and loving. He sees them as a \"finger of God.\" The video tape has not been released to the public, and thus far only one still photo has been released. Mr. van den Boeke has been recording the events surrounding his son over the past 15 years, and intends to put a book together, including some of the photos. However, Robbert says he felt com- pelled to release the still photo. Talbott says she would very much like to revisit the Boekes and investigate this latest episodes in detail.

However, there has already been an in- dication that the controversies which have developed regarding this case may affect future cooperation by the government. This incident is still being researched, and some details are not clear at this point (mid-May), but seems to have unfolded as follows: In the Ciudad del Carmen region of Campeche, Mexico, an eight-member Mexican Air Force crew was flying in a Merlin C26A two-engine detection/sur- veillance aircraft on a routine anti-drug pa- trol. The plane, which was equipped with a Forward Looking Infra Red (FLIR) Star Zapphir II device and AN/PS BravoVictor 3 radar, was flying between Copalar in the state of Chiapas and Carmen. The aircraft was piloted by Maj. Magdaleno Castanon Munoz, the FLIR operator was Lt. Mario Adrian Vazquez Tellez, and the radar operator was Lt. Ger- man Martin Ramirez-all members of the Mexican Air Force 501 Aerial Squadron. At approximately 5 PM as the aircraft turned toward Campeche the FLIR de- tected an unknown target at 10,500 feet, about 38 miles away, and the plane turned toward the object to identify it, suspecting that it might be a drug smuggling aircraft. The home base was told to be alert for HH3 •:.: Page 4 MUFON Journal j^g 2Q04"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Enhanced infrared image.

Although the unknown object was re- corded on radar and infrared, no visual contact was made, even though it was ap- proached within two miles, and the object suddenly flew away at a high speed. The Air Force crew reversed direction, but soon discovered that the object was still visible to the rear of the Merlin. Then a second object appeared in front of the Mer- lin, both showing up on radar and infra- red, but not visually. Then a third target showed on radar and FLIR. The FLIR infrared device showed that eight additional unknown objects enter- June 2004 ing the area, causing concern among the crew. These eight objects did not show up on radar, however. The objects \"surrounded\" the Merlin, creating even more concern for the crew, which still could not see the objects, ex- cept through the radar and infrared devices. The distance from the plane to the sur- rounding objects was not reported, but was apparently no closer than two miles. Now reportedly operating in red alert, and keeping their home base appraised of the situation, the crew turned off the plane's navigation lights to see if that would af- fect the situation. After a few moments the 11 objects de- MUFON Journal parted, but some reportedly continued to follow the aircraft. The Merlin crew re- turned to their base without further inci- dent. The encounter had taken about 24 minutes, according to the FLIR camera. The incident was reported through mili- tary channels, and Gen. Ricardo Clemente Vega Garcia, Secretary of National De- fense, ordered a preliminary investigation. Finally, on April 22 Gen. Vega con- tacted Maussan, a well-known Mexican television ufologist, and asked him to evaluate the sighting. In addition to the radar and infrared recordings, Maussan was given full access to the Merlin crew. He utilized the information on his TV show, \"Great Mysteries of the Third Millenium,\" on May 9, and set up a press conference on May 11 which included the infrared recordings, as well as the pres- ence of the crew members, apparently with the cooperation of Gen. Vega. MUFON photo analyst Dr. Bruce Maccabee noted that the size of the ob- jects could not be determined by the ap- parent size on the infrared screen, since they could be very small objects giving off a large amount of energy. It was also reported in a translation of Maussan's account that there was another object \"of enormous proportions,\" suppos- edly \"the size of a 15-story building,\" that the FLIR device recorded during the inci- dent. Again, the FLIR apparently does not provide the means of judging the size of objects, only the amount of energy. hi addition, no mention of this so-called \"mother ship\" was made in released inter- views of the pilot, so this portion of the encounter is even more tenuous than the rest. Maccabee also pointed out that, accord- ing to FLIR engineers, some of the sec- ondary images in the FLIR could be arti- facts of the camera optics. He adds that the objects, even if poten- tially visible to the naked eye, could be small enough at the reported distance from the aircraft not to be seen, but still large enough to show up on the radar and infra- red recorders-especially if the objects were not black, which would provide contrast with the sky, or shiny, which could reflect the sun. The radar operator reported that the ob- jects changed speeds rapidly (60-120-300 knots), and \"instantly\" changed flight paths (90 degrees, 130 degrees). However, only three of the objects appeared on radar. Maccabee has calculated that at least some of the the objects were moving at the same speed as the plane. Weather conditions were reported as \"optimal,\" with visibility of 96%.

The inset is an enlargement of the object. Grand Canyon video images A UFO or something else? By Bernie Rains Fast-moving lights in the sky at night or oddly shaped aerial objects observed during the day fuel the UFO controversy. My technical background persuades me to sustain an open mind concerning reported UFO encounters. I search for realism in the form of tech- nical details such as weather, sky cover, visibility, locations of the UFO and the observer, lighting conditions, and flight pattern. These and other factors enable one to evaluate account credibility. As a reader of this article, you will have the opportunity to evaluate the credibility of the film encounter I had with an uni- dentified flying object. I wish to caution you, though. The tech- nical information presented herein is in- sufficient to clearly prove that what I am about to share with you are prints from a video image of a UFO. As appropriately suggested to me by Jeff Sainio, a photographic technical con- sultant to MUFON, even a photograph does not produce all the evidence needed to convince a neutral individual of the re- ality of something strange. I will empha- size these data voids by quoting Sainio as necessary. After spending a few vacation days in Phoenix, AZ, with our daughter and her Page 6 family, my wife and I wanted to visit some of the natural wonders of the Great South- west. One site we visited was the Grand Canyon. Since more time was spent in Phoenix than originally planned, we could only enjoy one day at the canyon on June 9,2001. For our trip to Arizona I purchased a digital camcorder (Sony Model DCR- TRV530), which has features that allow one to extract still-images from videotape and transfer them to computer files for use in reports, e-mails, or other applications. After returning home, work obligations, family commitments, and the events of \"Sept. 11\" restrained me from an expedi- tious extraction of memorable images of our vacation. An interesting object When I finally found time, one image I extracted of the Grand Canyon was a view looking north toward Bright Angel Canyon from the South Rim Trail near Lookout Studio. This photo revealed an interesting object in the sky that neither my wife nor I saw while at the canyon. Initially, I speculated that due to its ap- parent size in relation to landforms, its shape, and its perceived distance consid- ering atmospheric haze, the object must be a dirigible (blimp) hovering over the north rim of the canyon. MUFON Journal However, other images extracted a few seconds later did not contain the object. The photo containing the UFO was taken at 2:12:44 p.m. Arizona time on June 9. The letters A, B and C have been af- fixed to a greyscale photo to identify the prominent landforms of Buddha Temple (A), Zoroaster Temple (B) and Bright Angel Canyon (C). I utilized a map of the Grand Canyon published by the National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior, plus popu- lar post cards purchased from the Grand Canyon Association to ascertain the names given to the geological features. Weather conditions during our visit to the canyon were good for photographing scenery. The sky was clear of clouds, and the sun was high overhead. Actual weather conditions recorded at the Grand Canyon National Park Airport (KGCN) were ob- tained from the Desert Research Institute, Western Regional Climate Center, Reno, NY. Hourly surface airways observations are recorded at this station daily, related to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). The photo time expressed in GMT was 2112:44 hours. Around that time the wind was 14 knots, gusting to 22 knots; temperature was 84 degrees F; dew point was 30 degrees F; barometric pressure was 30.24 inches of June 2004"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"- -^*». : - \" P - **•• ' * ' *> 3** a—.

When I showed the photo to a friend, he asked if he could view the original tape and check adjoining recorded \"frames\" by using computer software designed for such analysis. He informed me that my new camcorder \"snapped\" about 30 frames, or images, per second. He believed he could find some ration- al and practical explanation for the object appearing on that particular frame and not on others. Object in twelve frames While reviewing the photo frames be- fore and after the UFO image, my friend and I discovered that there were twelve consecutive frames containing UFO im- ages at different positions across the hori- zon. As I later found out to my chagrin, I could have seen the same progressive movement of the UFO using selected frame playback features of my camcorder had I taken the time to thoroughly read the manual. It is unfortunate that more of the flight path of the UFO was not captured on film, but the first UFO frame was recorded right after turning the camcorder on from a pre- vious filming location. Using a computer cut-and-paste tech- nique, photo strips containing UFO images on frames two through twelve were joined to the photo containing the first UFO im- age to show the flight path on one com- posite photo. The UFO appeared to me to be flying from northwest to southeast over the canyon's north rim, and more distant from me than Buddha and Zoroaster Temples. It was astonishing to both my friend and me that the UFO traveled across the field of view of the camcorder in such a short time period, i.e. 1 l/30ths or 0.37 of a sec- ond. Before continuing, I must point out that a critical assumption not based on pure scientific and mathematical relationships has been made. The assumption is that the object was behind an imaginary reference line connecting the peaks of Buddha Temple (A) and Zoroaster Temple (B). My assumption has been based on the follow- ing: First, simple visual perception when viewing the color photos and observing the atmospheric haze suggested the object to be behind peaks A & B. However, this position cannot be proven by mathemati- cal triangulation techniques, nor could the object at its perceived altitude verify such location by being obscured for a time dur- ing flight behind Zoroaster Temple. Second, the object appears to be get- ting closer to the camera during flight by its increased distance above the horizon in each subsequent photo frame, by a progres- sive increase in size of the object itself, and by increased distance between images. Third, a \"rough\" distance estimate us- ing a reverse color photo and changes in color intensity of initially dark landforms at measured distances from the camera suggested the object at the beginning of its flight sequence was about ten miles dis- tant. Image shortcomings Jeff Sainio has stated that \"the object is so small that both JPEG artifacts and glare make the object's color unreliable,\" and \"since a small object is all 'edge,' these effects make darkness measurements un- reliable.\" If the object is more distant from the camera than the reference line (AB), as I truly believe, then the speed, size and alti- tude estimates that follow are valid and somewhat conservative. In fairness to all, I must point out that MUFON's consult- ant believes my estimate of distance \"ap- pears to be guesswork.\" Continuing with my assump- tion, the distance traveled over ground by the UFO, while being recorded with the camcorder, was estimated utilizing topo- graphic maps of the Grand Can- yon purchased from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). From these maps, the distance between Buddha and Zoroaster Temple peaks was measured to be 20,000 feet, or about 3.78 miles. Using the composite photo, a proportional measure- ment of the distance traveled by the UFO between frames one and twelve was 16,300 feet, or 3.1 miles. The UFO, considering \"field of view\" time, traveled 3.1 miles in 0.37 of a sec- ond. If my calculations are correct, this speed equates to about 500 miles per minute, or 30,000 miles per hour. Putting this in perspective, the flight time between St. Louis and Louisville would be under a minute, and the flight time from New York to San Francisco would be about five minutes. With the earth having a circumference of about 25,000 miles at the equator, the UFO could make the trip around the world in a little under an hour. To estimate the size of the UFO, the distance on photo frame five between the peaks of Buddha and Zoroaster Temples (20,000 feet) was divided into 40 equal segments of 500 feet each. The scale thus produced was used to estimate the hori- zontal dimension of the UFO, which filled less than one scale increment. As large as a football field A tedious measurement of the horizon- tal width of the UFO image estimated its width to be about 350 feet, or approxi- mately the size of a football field. The vertical dimension of the object without considering possible influences from re- flected light was estimated to be 250 feet. This width to height relationship suggested its shape to resemble that of an oblate el- lipsoid. The UFO captured on film appeared to be flying only a few thousand feet above the ground. In an attempt to estimate the altitude of the object, the USGS topo- graphic maps were again utilized along with the tenth UFO frame. In this photo frame the UFO appears directly above the peak of Zoroaster Temple (B). The peak of Zoroaster Temple is at an elevation of 7,100 feet above mean sea level. By comparing identifiable land eleva- June 2004 MUFON Journal Page?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"tions on the topographic map with the photo of Zoroaster Temple, a plateau with an el- evation of 6,100 feet was selected as a ref- erence point. The difference in elevation (1,000 feet) between this reference point and the peak of Zoroaster Temple was used to develop a vertical scale to superimpose on the photo. An estimated altitude of 10,400 feet was assigned to the UFO (about 3,000 feet above ground). An object \"flying\" at low altitude and with such speed would be extremely diffi- cult to perceive with the naked eye, let alone physically react to its presence and capture on film. Line-of-sight in other lo- cales could be obstructed by ground ob- stacles such as hills, trees, and buildings. Attempts to magnify the object to see more detail were not successful. The digi- tal camcorder used to photograph the ob- ject did not have an image sensor with suf- ficient pixels to allow for much enlarge- ment without distortion of the object edges. A section of frame ten with the UFO and the peak of Zoroaster Temple has been magnified 400% to exemplify such loss of sharpness and distortion. In this enlarge- ment, the effects of pixelization can readily be seen. Zoroaster Temple becomes blurred and loses edge detail, and the UFO image, even though maintaining its ellip- soidal shape, appears blurred and indi- vidual pixels become discernible. An evaluation of the audio portion of the videotape for 63 seconds after the last image appeared did not reveal a sonic boom. At my location on the south rim of the canyon, the camcorder was about 6.8 miles from Zoroaster Temple. Considering sound to travel at about 1,100 feet per second, the UFO would have had to be more than 13 miles distant to not register a detectible sound-if there was a sound or a sonic boom. As time permits, additional color analy- ses are being conducted on the 12 UFO frames. Preliminary image color interpre- tations utilizing digital photo computer software have been performed. The results indicate the presence of a yellow halo sur- rounding the image on each of the twelve frames. As pointed out to me by Sainio, image recording format (JPEG) may create arti- facts at the edges of high contrast objects and cause complementary colors (yellow being the complement of blue) to appear, adding another element of uncertainty. The UFO described in this account had flight characteristics not common to this world's generally accepted methods of air travel. The craft, if it was a craft, may have its origin within our government's research community-or elsewhere. PageS Centerville, Ohio Explosive UFO visitation or uncanny abnormality? By Kenny Young Most residents of Centerville, OH, who were up and about at 5:30 AM on Satur- day, March 6,2004, were going about their normal routines, waiting for daylight to break. Activity at police dispatch head- quarters, however, was anything but rou- tine. Phone lines began to light up with citi- zen reports of bizarre \"flashing in the sky\" and electrical disruptions that seized a large area from Lakeview Drive to Bethel Road, Stone Lake, and Linden. One after another the calls came in. \"Centerville Police,\" said the flustered police dispatcher to yet another caller. \"Has the whole street called? asked the voice on the other end. \"Oh my God. I saw it; it was right over my house, and it hov- ered down... I can't believe I'm saying this! It looked like an ALIEN SHIP...!\" A solid object The resident on Lakeview Drive later contacted for this report contends that a solid physical object was present in the skies near Stingley Elementary School in Centerville. This object was hovering at near tree- top level and would interact with nearby power lines, causing an arcing \"flash\" that would send a powerful explosive report across the sleepy and confused neighbor- hood. This detail is consistent with callers heard on the 911 police tapes of the inci- dent, obtained through the diligence of UFO investigator Bruce M. Forrester, Jr., of Bellbrook, OH, in which area residents informed police of the sky lighting up and electrical disruptions. One caller said the source of the bright flashing was \"near Stingley school.\" The Lakeview Drive resident, who lives across from the school, and who also ob- served the object with his wife, said, \"This house-sized object was a saucer-shaped metallic structure, polished aluminum sur- face, with alternating sets of rotating, flare- like lights.\" He adds, \"The two sets of lights clearly rotated in opposite directions and were very bright, consisting of several colors rang- ing from yellow, amber, white, and blue. MUFON Journal There was no smoke or exhaust that I could see.\"' This UFO was somehow interacting with power lines near Stingley Elementary School, according to the primary claimant. After each blinding explosion the air pres-. sure in the neighborhood would \"change\" with a loud concussion, and at that point all the power would go out across the neighborhood. Following this disruption, the UFO would vanish from its place at treetop level near the school. The same-or a separate, identical object—would \"reappear\" over an adjacent field as the power in the region would slowly come back. This object would then assume a slow path and amble back toward the school to its previous position, where it would again explode with a flash after making some kind of \"arcing\" contact with the power lines. This procedure, as described by the Lakeview Drive resident, would repeat several times. Trees in the area were burnt during this drama. Branches and limbs were said by the Lakeview Drive witness to flame and \"glitter\" for several hours after the inci- dent like flashing 4 th of July fireworks. \"I wish that there was a good explana- tion for this,\" said the Lakeview Drive witness, a 25-year old father of a newly- born baby and working in \"financial ser- vices.\" He explainted that the object \"moved over the school and came down in the field. I saw it raise and lower. I know it was con- trolled, and I wish I had somebody to come to my door and lay it on the line; just give me a good answer for all this.\" Officers sent to scene According to police logs obtained from the Centerville Police Department, police officers were dispatched to the scene about 5:45 AM, shortly after the calls began. Fire logs obtained from the Washing- ton Township fire department indicate that a fire truck was dispatched to the location at 5:48 AM, and another unit sent at 5:58 AM. Making this situation a tad more inter- esting are reports that emergency respond- ers in the fire department ladder truck also June 2004"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"saw the UFO, and the gauges on their emer- gency vehicle \"went funny.\" According to the Lakeview Drive resi- dent, \"The firemen were repeatedly ask- ing me for descriptions of what I saw, and I told them, and they said 'that's the same thing we saw,'\" citing firemen and police officers who loudly communicated with each other at the scene of the bedlam. \"I told the two fire officers what I saw and asked them if I sounded like a com- plete lunatic,\" said the Lakeview Drive resident. \"He told me that I was not a lu- natic and that they saw it too, and it made the gauges in their truck go nuts.\" Following this tantalizing lead, an in- quiry was made to find out if emergency responders were also witnesses to this UFO. Officials refuse to talk Telephone inquiries to the Centerville Fire Department's \"Station 41\" about this issue were not warmly received, and the simple phone call requesting some basic information on the March 6 dispatch was rejected. Lt. Sarah Lee, handling the inquiry to her department, advised that she could not be of any help. To the contrary, the wag- ons were circling, the moat was being filled, and hatches were being battened down as it was announced that any incom- ing inquiry must be made via written request.\"Why don't you call Wright Patterson Air Force Base?\" she said after listening briefly to the weird 911 tape by telephone. She added, \"Wright Pat can help you more than I can. Unfortunately, I cannot answer any of your questions. It is routine procedure and policy for us to not give out information without proper authorization.\" Suddenly the operations and practices of this basic public agency seemed to be operating like the Freedom of Information Office of the super-secret \"Blue Room\" of Wright Patterson Air Force Base, the very base the inquiry was referred to. A friendly letter was then penned to Fire Chief Parks, basically asking to be put in contact with the emergency responders who were on the scene of the UFO incident on March 6. \"I am not sure who gave you your in- formation, but it appears they were aware of something we did not see or share in,\" said Fire Chief Kenneth C. Parks in re- sponse to the request. Apparently, the chief also did not take kindly to the request for contact info with the emergency responders who were dis- patched to the scene on March 6: \"Our people are required by policy to refrain from discussing fire department actions without proper authorization. By policy, their reports are their response to any ques- tions, outside of court action.\" Centerville's Assistant City Manager Judy Gilleland said she was unaware of the mass confusion of March 6, despite assuring me that she would be aware of any such report as was described to her. She seemed to take little interest or show little concern in the report of an object hovering over Stingley Elementary School. \"I believe I would know about downed power lines and trees, and I have heard nothing of the sort,\" she said. \"Good news for us; perhaps bad news for you?\" Assistant City Manager.Gilleland, Fire Chief Parks, and Lt. Lee were all advised that there should be some concern of ra- dioactivity near the site of Stingley El- ementary School. These public employees clearly expressed a disinterest in the event described by witnesses on March 6. Is this a dangerous complacency that reeks of ultimate disregard for public safety in an uncertain time? Could Homeland Security be any more proud? Weeks after the event, the damaged tree branches were analyzed with a radiation detection monitor by Phyllis Budinger, Frontier Analysis. No radiation above normal background was detected. There may or may not be a firm expla- nation for the object described over Stingley school, but even if it were to have been some classified military operation (Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Day- ton/Beavercreek is less than 19 miles northwest), there should be some valid concern regarding a military operation so low over a residential area and near a school. Further, the type of propulsion method used on such a classified project and the possibility of lingering radiation near the school could pose threatening conditions for families and children in the areas of the school, Lakeview Drive, Bethel Road, and Linden Road. This should be a sober concern. Instead, public hirelings in Centerville have dismissed this episode as a case of \"wires arcing in high winds.\" Wind not the culprit However, an inquiry made with the Na- tional Weather Service at Wilmington, OH, revealed that although there was a high wind alert earlier on March 5, high winds during the time of the reported inci- dent were not an issue. Between 4 and 5 AM on March 6 tem- peratures and conditions in Centerville were in the mid 40s, with winds out of the northwest at only 12 miles per hour,. Further complicating the \"high wind\" dismissal would be comments from a tele- phone receptionist at Dayton Power & Light in which the cause of a power out- age near Lakeview Drive on March 6 was reportedly due to a \"circuit lockout\" that took place from 5:34 until 10:45 AM, re- sulting in service disruption.There was no mention of high winds. As for the Lakeview Drive resident, he isn't very comfortable with the situation. \"It's clear to me that something blew up there where the burnt trees are,\" he said. There is no transformer there to blow up. That concerns me, given the magnitude of the explosion.\" But essentially the strangeness of this whole situation rests with the testimony of this Lakeview Drive resident and his wife, who both claim they observed a very sen- sational physical and intelligently-con- trolled object situated low in the sky near Stingley school. This is reflected on the emergency 911 police tapes as the caller considers his own words with disbelief at what he is claim- ing to observe in the sky near his home. While others in the neighborhood were in- deed alarmed-and also called police head- quarters-they were reporting only generic \"flashing\" in the sky, along with power dis- ruptions. The Lakeview Drive resident also re- ports concern that his infant has experi- enced hair loss, although this could be nor- mal as babies sometimes do lose their hair. Or then again, perhaps it's just those high winds. An inspection of the material by infra- red scans of both the charred and unburned areas by Phyllis Budinger of Frontier Analysis, as well as spectra analysis of solvent extractions (hexane, acetone/ methanol mix and water) from these areas showed nothing unusual.

As my son and I were talking in our driveway in Bristol, TN, I turned and saw what ap- peared at first to be a child's balloon ex- tremely high in the sky, moving through scattered clouds left over from a storm front which had passed earlier in the day. This thing was hardly worth a second look, except that it kept \"blinking out\" as if it was fiat and rotating on its axis. Both my son and I watched the object for some time to our north as it moved toward us, southward and downward. Curiosity took hold, and I ran for a pair of binoculars while my son watched the object. Describing the object is difficult. Per- fection, absolute symmetry, with a mottled copper skin which seemed to be flowing like plasma. The object was to- tally rigid, but my mind told me it was \"alive\" somehow. There are actually no words to describe this object as we saw it through binoculars. After being absolutely awe-struck for a good three to five minutes, I finally re- alized that we needed photographic proof. After making a dash of some 100 feet to the hilltop cabin, I retrieved a cheap digi- tal camera, a used VMS tape, and an an- cient camcorder which I was sure had a dead battery. Upon returning outside, we were joined now by my wife, who was well in the fight for possession of the binoculars to view this wonderous object. I began taking digital stills, 23 total, none of which took. I then turned on the old camcorder and inserted the used tape.The battery was half full. I managed to shoot the object at full zoom (12X), and also shot references which, as it turned out, were very help- ful for analysis. There was a small time period of 2.5 minutes in which the object stayed in plain sight, rolling, hovering, rising, and sim- ply appearing as a \"raptor\" as it soared about. The object moved slowly and straight to the west, where it was wit- nessed by three small children who still draw pictures of the \"ghost\" in the sky ._-,..,;_: ..V^.:. , ,   • ' j A characteristic of enlarged frames from video tapes is lack of detail. How- ever, as the two inserts show, the video does document the change in apparent shape of the object as it maneuvered in the sky. that frightened them that summer evening. The analysis and investigation It is extremely difficult for a person to investigate his/her own sighting and re- main unbiased. I did not belong to MUFON at this time and was unaware of the procedure which a Field Investiga- tor takes to conduct an investigation, so I proceeded as best I knew how to build a sturdy \"framework\" on the sighting with accurate, sound data. My first move was to call my local FAA office, approximately 20 miles to my west, and inquire about possible anoma- lous returns on their radar. I was shocked to find that the control tower's radar will register a return on aircraft only with tran- sponders. Shockingly, this object was fly- ing around on the approach to Tri-City's runway 23. My next step was to confirm weather data for the day. I called the NWS office nearest me and received wind data for the day. Remember the wind direction from the beginning? Winds for August 2, time period of 1900-2200 hrs, at 5-10,000 feet were from the WSW at 10-15 knots. This data was retrieved from radar pro- files for the time frame and from three NWS ground stations. There goes any chance of the object being a balloon. Bal- loons do not fly across or against the wind. My next step was to contact local TV stations and newspapers, hoping for pub- lic reaction and possible new witnesses for triangulation. No one would touch the story. I finally met a young reporter for a weekly county paper that wished only to write the truth on the story. He had filled an entire page, and his editors hacked the story to pieces and added \"scary\" Hal- loween stories on the same page to make the sighting appear as fictitious garbage. The editors of this paper also had the reporter take the tape I furnished him to a local astrophysist/college professor, who deemed the sighting a \"hoax\" perpetrated with a \"mall UFO balloon.\" He would not even consider the data that I painstakingly collected to assure that no scientific mind could discount the sighting. I have challenged this gentleman on Coast to Coast radio to re-create this Page 10 MUFON Journal June 2004"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"sighting with a mall advertising balloon at my expense, and with \"like\" weather con- ditions. He cannot, so therefore he has never responded to the challenge. As of this date, only three minor chil- dren have been identified as witnesses to the same object. Jeff Sainio and Bruce Maccabee both received copies of the video. Both have arrived at practically the same numbers on this sighting. Sainio found possible atmospheric scattering due to great dis- tance, and determined that the object was in excess of 20 feet at an approximate dis- tance of 4 miles. Dr. Macabee arrived at a slightly larger object, 30+ feet at a lesser distance of 16,000 feet. He also requested and re- ceived a calibration video from the same video camera, and I taped a yard stick horizontally and vertically at a measured 50 feet. This obviously gave Dr. Macabee a true bit of data from the camera for ref- erencing. This sighting, like so many with data, along with photographic proof, com- bine to make a case that truly cannot be explained. The same object? I was contacted by Peter Davenport (NUFORC) soon after we had done the Coast to Coast show in regards to this sighting. He asked me to look at the re- port of a disc-shaped object in Washing- ton state several days after my sighting. This gentleman was at an air show and experienced a carbon copy of the disc object which I taped, according to his de- scription. All characteristics of shape, size, and flight characteristics were identical to the Bristol disc. In review of NUFORC data , I have found this a slow, meander- ing object, dark in color, referred to by many witnesses. Recently I did a \"tape and data swap\" with Jack Kasher, who is currently inves- tigating a dramatic daylight sighting in Nebraska. Surprisingly, again, there are remarkable similarities to the object which I caught on tape. My analysis of current data from all sources shows a marked increase in re- cent times of this type of \"slow, dark discoid\" anomaly which seems to offer an easy target for a camera . Sightings for Feb. 29, 2004 Beautiful clear blue skies, no wind, a picture of a beautiful late winter Sunday evening. The time was approximately 5:30 PM, and my wife and son had left to go shopping. I received a phone call from them when they were about a mile away on 42IN heading into Bristol. My wife 1 1 rv &s'p'orr . /I n / I-«.D -ii\"» s S 5c«r>. OL.S <«*»«'<•><. '\"' v, - •*.

Looking out the window, 1 could see something over the highway hovering. This is daytime, again. My wife and son had slowed down, as had traffic on the highway, watching this object. My only thought was to hang up the phone and grab binoculars and camcorder and head outside. I arrived in my drive- way, and acquired the object first with binoculars. It appeared flat black, elliptical, with an aspect ratio of approximately 6-1. Its flight was slow, yet methodical; moving slowly due east and rising, then falling. To my suprise, the object rolled over to reveal a brilliant metallic side. I also kept changing from the camcorder to the bin- oculars to insure the object was not a bal- loon. I am sure that it was not, yet it was much different from the August object from the previous year. It appeared more benign and mechanical. This object simply, slowly ascended beyond even the view of my binoculars. Again, it is difficult to investigate one's own sighting, but I once again submitted video to Jeff Sainio and sent a report to my State Director. Multiple objects interact That same night I received a call from a gentleman who had been referred to me by the FAA office here locally. (Undeni- able proof that an aggressive network ini- tiative brings results, which is yet another story.) There had been a plane crash that day, and this witness thought his sighting might have been the cause, but it was ruled pi- lot error. This gentleman was excited and confused about what he had witnessed. I interviewed him for several hours in a casual setting to get his full story. This sighting was in Kingsport, TN, about 25 miles to my west at also 5:30 PM. Witness #1 stated that his son asked him to come outside and look at the \"things\" in the sky.\" Upon exiting his house, the witness saw a large golden disc which the witness described as looking like \"quicksilver\"(mercury) with 5 smaller \"lights\" unattached and unrelated, mov- ing and interacting with the larger disc. Two of the smaller \"light\" objects were blue. One small object was turquoise green, and the other one was red. The blue objects would circle the large disc and move away, stopping, then moving in repeating patterns. All during this sighting these objects were ascending in the clear blue sky. As soon as the disc and colored objects were out .of sight, there were two high altitude, high speed passes of what the witnesses have described as cylinder-shaped objects. (See above sketch.) Witness #1 took several digital photo- graphs with a very inexpensive camera, and only a few frames show any objects at all. I submitted these to Jeff Sainio, but the quality was so bad that no data could be gathered from them. There were five adult witnesses to this sighting that I have been able to find. Trucker report I was contacted March 26, 2004, by a gentleman who drives a gasoline tanker truck some hundred miles to Knoxville, TN, and back to Bristol twice nightly. His June 2004 MUFQN Journal Page 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"job is to fill the underground tanks at gas stations here locally. Since the events of \"9-11,\" truckers- especially gasoline haulers-are asked to \"convoy\" or to try to stay with partners on the highway for security reasons. He referred back to the night of March 22 at about 8:00-9:00 PM when he was the first of a two-truck \"run\" to Knox- ville. The second witness, the driver be- hind this gentleman, radioed that he was watching something strange in the dark night sky. As these two trucks moved along the dark rural interstate, they were watching a bright red pulsating light which seemed to keep pace with them as they travelled at 70 miles per hour. For short periods, the light would simply \"go out\" then re- appear in another part of the sky. While lit, the light would never go com- pletely out, but change intensity. He stated that the object reminded him of a beating heart. The two gentlemen watched the light until they were near Knoxville, when the light simply \"went out.\" The entire event lasted about 40 min- utes, and during the return trip and the second trip that same night, the object did not re-appear. Fast foreward to the night of March 23. Same two witnesses, same trucks, same highway. The time was about the same as well, approximately 8:00-9:00 PM. The gentleman repeated the same events for this night. The red light paced them, mile for mile, pulsating then going out, only to re-appear in a different part of the sky. There was a slight difference in the \"light\" this night, as it now had a neon green small light at its bottom which also pulsated in an opposing fashion to the larger red one. He also stated that the object was only \"with them\" during their first trip to Knox- ville and not the second, nor have they seen the light since. The witness to whom I spoke has had extensive military experience, having been a crew chief on a B-52 Bomber in excess of 15 years, and is adamant that the light was no aircraft, due to its size, shape, and lack of any other lighting. Filer appointed VP of Skywatch International George Filer, MUFON's Eastern Re- gion Director and author of the popular Filer's Files, has been appointed vice- president of Skywatch International, ac- cording to an announcement by Jim Hickman, executive director of Skywatch International, Inc. . Page 12 Near mid-air collision not to be discussed By Richard N. Motsinger This story can't be about a UFO \"sight- ing\" because I, myself, saw nothing. Nor did I feel, hear, or receive any message from what had to have been a \"craft\" not of man's making. But those two Air Force majors a few feet feet above me simply went half-crazy with their sighting-and a very near mid-air collision involving the B-25 we were in. (This was a twin-engine, medium bomber from World War II.) I was a student in my senior year of aeronautical engineering at Purdue Univer- sity in West Lafayette, IN. The year was 1950, and I was returning from a Naval ROTC cruise. A few years previously, my Stanford University friend and I had found that our modest \"travel orders\" to return to our respective universities could get us on Air Force flights accepting \"transient military personnel.\" This UFO happening started at Elmendorf Air Force Base in Houston, where my B-25 free ride was returning to Chanute Air Force Base in Illinois. The two Air Force officers were put- ting in their required monthly flight times, and by strange coincidence were return- ing to Purdue themselves, by automobile a two-hour drive from Chanute. The Air Materiel Command/Wright AFB, OH, had sent career officers (among them Gus Grissom) to engineering schools in preparation for their transfers to the NASA space program. I was a bit thrilled to take up a passen- ger position on the very nose (\"green- house\") of the ship, on my belly. I had to wear intercom headphones so the pilot(s) could move me about. Somewhere just south of Shreveport, LA (and Barksdale AFB), my clear view of the ground was interrupted by the pilot going berserk. \"Dallas Control! Dallas Control! Near mid-air, near mid-air! (collision) 'Bogie' headed west ... No ID could be made ... extreme velocity. Air Force B-25 return- ing to Chanute Field! Dallas, do you read me? Near mid-air!\" After landing, the officers drove all of us back to West Lafayette, IN, in a si- lence of dramatic proportions. Finally I came out of my stupor and said, \"Fel- MUFON Journal lows, what really happened up there? I didn't see or hear a thing.\" The reply was terse, to say the least. \"You are not to re- late any of this flight to anyone, ever! Don't talk to us, now or ever again.\" And I never breathed a word, at school. Some days later, I passed one of these Air Force officers on a crowded campus walkway. Silence. And he had a look of... fear, dread, panic maybe. What a stare! The Black Vault may be on TV The Black Vault's extensive Internet collection of declassified government docu- ments compiled by John Greenewald Jr through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) may become the basis of a TV show. Black Vault staffers recently completed a week long trip to Wash- ington, DC, to film the first round of interviews intended for use in the show, which is still looking for a network. The setting was the \"X-Conference,\" the first Exopolitics Con- vention, attended by many of the world's most qualified and credible researchers, authors, scientists, and governmental staff- ers on the subject of UFO disclosure. To be based on the eight-year-old website, www.blackvault.com, the TV show is being described as \"the real X- Files.\" The series would tackle not only the UFO phenomenon, but also such top- ics as human chemical/biological tests and recent releases on the alleged JFK con- spiracy. Each episode would look at how the government operates by examining and exposing recently declassified Top Secret documents acquired through the FOIA, according to Greenewald, who will be one of the speakers at the 2004 MUFON In- ternational Symposium in Denver.

I didn't really know what to think, as he is such a skeptic and is a very logi- cal thinker, so I went outside for a minute. \"It was cloudy, and at first I couldn't see anything, but then I saw a series of white lights, not round, but more rectangular- shaped lights, and they formed a cluster, flashing. \"Then a second circle of lights formed around the cluster; then a third and final circle of lights surrounded the other two circles. The lights were ro- tating in a circle, and were flashing. I could barely believe my eyes. v \"What we were looking at was the base of something of incredible size. It was huge, about the size of a football field, massive, and the small circle of lights seemed to spin and the whole thing tilted. \"I was frightened, and I kept asking my husband what is it? He said he didn't know, and that is why he had to show me. Ten minutes later he went outside again, and it had gone. \"It was huge, and was definitely the bottom of something very large; the sheer size of it is what got me. How could something that big be in the sky? The lights must have been extremely bright to shine through the clouds as they did. I am a mother of four grown children, and I am a pharmacy assistant. My husband is a supervisor at his work.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, Director, ufocenter.com New York flying triangle BRISTOL/CANANDAIGUA - An al- mond-shaped, disk-type object was ob- served hovering over the hills on April 30, 2004, at 11 PM. The object, bigger than the light it projected, was observed through binoculars, and the outline of the object was visible, but it was not lit. Two other similar objects were seen which changed shape as they moved back and forth, then up and down. These were not planes, satellites and stars, the wit- ness emphasized: \"I could see almost ev- ery turn they made as they changed from almond shape to disk shape to something that seemed perfectly round and hovered right over my house. \"There was a design on the bottom of this one craft, almost like that of a phoe- nix or some type of fancy geometrical de- sign. The one that came the closest was mostly grey, but would shift into a bright blue, white, and then it would flash some- thing red once in a while. \"It had an aura around it, and it would move towards the other two in the sky (which were farther away then the one I was observing). When that happened the other two would seem to move rapidly and disappear at random moments, and then reappear. \"As I watched this one come closer, I could feel a 'pull' that is hard to explain unless someone has experienced what I am talking about. I was outside when this happened, and these objects were appear- ing in the eastern skies. \"I stood there studying them for about three hours. I lost track of time, and then became too tired to continue. I remember before walking into the house around 3 AM that there was a huge thing that swept right under it (the object) on my final glance, and I am not sure how to explain that one. Out of all the suspected UFOs I have seen, this one concerned me most.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, Director, ufocenter.com California flying triangle MERCED - The witness was driving north on 1-5 with his parents when around 12:30 AM on April 14,2004, they noticed an odd pair of lights. He states, \"I first noticed it when the object was vertical with only two corners visible, like viewing a triangular block from the side. The small triangular object had round circular and cycled lights on three corners. To visualize one set of lights, imagine a cross section of a pipe with many lights making the circle. \"These lights alternated like Christmas lights, and looked like electricity was mov- ing through them. It hovered over the high- way for maybe 30 seconds, and quickly sped off behind the overpass. As I ap- proached the overpass it flew speeding back over the highway and hovered very low. \"It actually passed right in front of my car twice, and then hovered off to the left and shined a light right at me from the right-hand side. This light came from one of the sides, not from one of the corners of the object, as I drove 80 mph. I saw it for probably close to a minute or two to- tal, but it seems longer. \"It was 3 to 5 feet in length and defi- nitely not wider than my Civic. However it had great agility and speed, and it was silent.\" Scotland speeding lights EDINBURGH - The witness states, \"At 1:05 AM on Wednesday, April 21,1 was standing outside my house having a ciga- rette, looking to the northeastern sky from my home town Livingston when I saw two dots of lights suddenly shoot down- ward from the cloudy sky. \"They were moving at an incredible speed, and they were keeping almost the same distance, running parallel to each other. They turned sharply and came par- allel to the horizon, and went on for a couple of seconds, during which time they both took another short dive and came back level again. \"From there, they seemed to shoot back up into the sky and vanish back above the clouds, and there was no sound at all! I have never seen anything move that fast in my life. They were illuminat- ing the clouds they were flying under.\" Arkansas nuclear facility sighting RUSSELVILLE - On April 15, 2004, at 10:11 PM as the witness got his mail he saw two large orange balls of light directly above his house, about 30 degrees up and June 2004 MUFON Journal Page 13"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"over the Arkansas Nuclear 1 Reactor about two miles from his location. He states, \"I watched as the two lights split into three, then four, and then disappeared completely. I do not know how long they were there, since I only caught the ap- parent end of the display.\" New Jersey shape changer WOODBRIDGE - The observer was traveling west on Oak Tree Road when his attention was drawn to a jet black glossy cylindrically-shaped object that was floating northeast at less than 1,000 feet on April 30, 2004, at 10:25 PM. The witness states, \"It had to be huge, more them 75 feet in length and at least 10 feet in diameter. It was shaped like a glossy black sausage casing, and it would periodically go into a formal V-shape, and then speed up in that direction of travel. \"As it crossed in front of me on Wood Avenue the sun would glint off this rotat- ing sausage-shaped object. Two smaller spheres were also observed, one attached at each end. This object would also rotate end over end, stop, go straight vertically, hover for a few seconds after bending in the middle from a v-shaped profile, and maintain this attitude for a few seconds before going on. \"It also maintained a true and straight altitude, for if it was a balloon, it would have risen while in my view. I pointed it out to a few passer-bys, but they said it was a balloon. The object then drifted in a stop-and-go manner out over the Gar- den State Parkway, and then I lost sight of the object. \"The temperature was 60 degrees, partly sunny, and the wind was calm. It is also one year ago (5-1-03) when I saw a similar changing object in the vicinity.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, ufocenter.com Iran has numerous reports TEHRAN - Numerous UFO sightings are being reported over Iran. Fanciful car- toons of alien spacecraft have adorned the front pages of newspapers, while state television showed a sparkling white disc it said was filmed over Tehran. Fox News showed pictures that appeared to be clas- sic disc shapes moving over a city area. Iran is developing nuclear weapons, and UFOs almost always take an interest in these developments. Many UFOs beaming out green, red, blue, and purple rays were seen over the northern cities of Tabriz and Ardebil and in the Caspian Sea. Newspapers and agencies reported people rushing out into the streets in eight towns to watch a bright extraterrestrial light dipping in and out of the clouds. Delaware hovering craft SEAFORD/OLD BRIDGE - Driving south on Route 13 the witness noticed two bright white lights low on the horizon on April 30, 2004, at 3:15 PM, that were not moving. As he drove closer and almost got under them, he says he noticed that they were just hovering about 1,000 feet off the ground, so he pulled over and got out of the car and looked up. The witness states, \"The two white lights were on an object, and were aiming straight out. The object was shaped like a stop sign with just five sides, dark in color maybe grey or black, and was silent, not a peep of sound. \"I started to get a little nervous and had a delivery to make right down the street, so I jumped back in the car and made my delivery. When I went back again to look, it was gone. First time in my life I have ever seen a UFO.\" Thanks to Peter Dav- enport, Director, ufocenter.com Large disc in Indiana MOORESVILLE - Peter Davenport called to inform me he is having computer troubles similaivto my own. He told me that two disc-shaped UFOs were reported over Indiana. The witness was traveling south on state highway 67 south, just north of Mooresville, when a silver disc 10-12 feet in diameter about 300 feet high passed over his RAV4 on April 3,2004, at 7:30 PM. \"It was moving from west to east at about 100 mph at around a 3 to 5-degree upward angle,\" said the witness. \"It looked to be about 3-4 feet thick; no lights, no wings, no sound, and no smoke. It was a disc or saucer-shaped object with rows of lights.\" Another disc in Indiana LOGANSPORT - On April 8,2004, the witness reports, \"My husband and I, along with my oldest daughter, were leaving my in-laws when I noticed lights above a neighbor's trees around their house. \"There was a black and grey disc or saucer-shaped object with rows of lights for about 5 or 6 seconds, then the lights shut off like someone flipped a switch, and the object disappeared. \"My 12-year-old daughter saw the same thing, and my husband only saw a glare of lights on the truck and ground. He could not see it due to the position of the object.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, Director, NUFORC. Connecticut flying triangle ENFIELD - The witness reports, \"Coming out of the house at 8 PM on April 5, 2004, my right eye quickly caught a light, or lights, off to the right. I looked up and saw a craft of some kind, so I quickly grabbed my camcorder that hap- pened to be on my front seat of my truck. \"From this point on I have it on video. It's not the best. I tried to zoom in and out, and the camera didn't like that in dark- ness. I took a couple of street lights, but the craft had three triangle lights, with one in the center flashing. \"It was coming towards me over nearby homes. I followed it with the cam- era until it got to the end of the street, when I noticed another craft coming from the opposite way traveling towards us. The two met at the end of the street. \"This other craft was flashing a white light and had stationary lights surround- ing it, just like the one I saw up close. I got into my truck to go look for them, but they had gone. But above the old town pool park I saw both of them hovering, almost fully cloaked in darkness. \"One wasn't all the way cloaked; it's hard to explain, but to the right of the craft, it was lit up, just a little, and its lights were lower, then stronger. It was doing some- thing, while the other stayed stationary to its left. Finally the light went out, and both of them were cloaked, but each of the craft had one little light at each end, as if it was a distant star far off. \"The lights were on each side, with a certain distance apart. The other craft had the same lights barely visible, and it hov- ered just a little distance from the other. The one on the left crossed over to the right, moving towards me, and it started to follow me as I am walking. I got inside my truck as it left, still cloaked. \"I was roughly 35 yards away as I filmed the smaller craft that was a little smaller than a small airplane. It had three lights, one in the center, while the fourth was flashing a white light. A light was also being beamed out towards the other side. \"The craft went at a good pace; trav- eling with one light as a leading part of the craft while the other two lights were on the sides. There was no sound. In the video, it goes behind telephone poles and phone lines.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, UFOcenter.

I was amazed to see this unusual object go by, making no sound as it passed almost on top of where I was standing. \"It was just a couple of hundred feet away. This thing looked huge as it flew off. I was unable to see it anymore, so I went back inside my house and tried to go to sleep. I tossed and turned and could not sleep. This is the second sighting I have seen since moving to South Caro- lina.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, Direc- tor, ufocenter.com. Large Iowa object has big bang PERRY - The witness says, \"It was really big, and it was glowing neon green when it stopped just above the McCreary Recreation Center on April 1, 2004, at 12:27 PM. Then, it started to spin, mak- ing a soft pitched whine. \"Then, it started changing shapes, and it started turning orange, then red, then back to green. Then after a few hours of that it just stopped, and it was almost like it was going to fall out of the sky when it took off, leaving a blue trail of something in the air. \"The craft turned white, then made a sound somewhat like a gunshot being fired from a 12 gauge, then disappeared. Later, my friend and I went over there and we found this strange metal book, but it won't open, and it has strange writing on it.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, UFOcenter. Tennessee backward arrowhead NEWPORT - \"It was shaped some- what like an arrowhead flying back- wards,\" says the witness, \"with what looked to be a head or knob on the front on April 5, 2004, at 11 PM. It didn't look mechanical; it was more like some kind of animal. \"It did not have extended wings like a bird of any kind, but seemed to have some sort of stubby wings which were part of the body, like a flying.squirrel or some type of bat. \"They protruded out near the head, and tapered back to a point at the rear. The creature appeared to be around three feet from head to tail, and a little over 2 feet wide at the shoulders. \"It was moving very fast in a straight line at an altitude of approximately 150 ft. June 2004 I saw no method of propulsion, such as wing movement. It just seemed to be glid- ing, but at a high rate of speed. It main- tained level flight, moving west where I eventually lost sight of it. \"Other details were a light brown color along the sides of the wings, like skin, with a dark body color, possibly dark brown or black.\" Thanks to Peter Dav- enport, UFOcenter. Kansas sphere-like craft. LAWRENCE - \"My roommates were all watching TV in the dorm,\" the wit- ness reports, \"when they suddenly jumped up and started freaking out while looking at three lights flying over Lewis Hall on April 21, 2004, at 10:35 PM. \"I was totally confused, and thought they were messing with me. I got up to look, and saw lights floating in the sky, but I was still skeptical while the lights continued onward towards the dorms. It then came into view. It was obvious that it had a sphere-like shape with three lights. I thought, this has to be an airplane, until it plainly came in view. \"It then flew over the dorm. I ran into the room across the hall and looked through their window. The UFQ at this point began to roll head over heels, as vis- ible by the lights, and then flew off quickly out of sight. - \"Unless the government has some sort of secret hovering sphere-like craft, I am now an unwanting believer.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, Director, ufocenter.com Arizona object throws sparks SUPERIOR - A man was driving east on Highway 60 in rural Arizona on April 28, 2004, at 9 PM, and saw an object north of the road just outside Gold Can- yon. He states, \"At first, I thought I was seeing single sparks from fireworks, but then I noticed that there were evenly spaced rotating lights, and then it left my view. I called my wife on my cell phone, and she thought I was crazy. \"Then about 15 minutes later I saw the same craft as I was beginning my assent of Gonzales Pass on the south side of Highway 60. \"This time it was lower in the night sky, and I got scared. Again it appeared as single sparks of fireworks, but it was certainly a craft of some sort, and the 'sparks' were light. The lights did not light up the sky; they seemed as though they were running lights. \"This area is notorious for military F- 16 fighter training flights. I wonder if the government is testing new aircraft, or if it was something else.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, ufocenter.com MUFON Journal Washington state object SEATTLE - The witness reports \"a huge object traveling from north to south on April 29, 2004, at 11:10 PM that seemed very high in the sky and very mas- sive. It was vaguely triangle/rectangle- shaped. \"It had three irregular-shaped, very dim glowing areas. I was looking at the moon about 15 degrees to my right when I no- ticed it at about 80 degrees high. It faded at 50 degrees and was a red/amber color. \"After testing and evaluation, I am cer- tain that it was not an after-image from looking at the moon. The features were not similar, and after looking away and back again with a little scrutiny I found it again. \"There was no noise and no flashing lights. At all times it was hard to discern. It seemed to pause at 50 degrees, then continue.

They were travel- ing at a very high rate of speed from east to west as if racing each other. The witness reports, \"One was a small distance behind the other, but they crossed directly over us, and the gap between them closed, and they were side by side. Never have I witnessed anything travel at such a high rate of speed and about the same height as commercial jets. \"The sky was very clear and full of stars.

Calhoun, GA-05April04-At about 10:30PM, a 30-year-old male resident of Calhoun reported that he was outside with his astronomy telescope when he felt a strange tingling sensation. He looked up and observed a large triangular-shaped ob- ject just above the tree tops. His first impression was that the object was a helicopter, but he heard no sound. This craft was moving slowly towards Calhoun proper, projecting a bright blue searchlight-like beam. It continued on, south to north, until it went over to the other side of an adjacent mountain and vanished. MUFONGA has no field investigator in the Calhoun area. Efforts are currently underway to contact our Mark Kravitz of Marietta so that he can attempt to develop some additional details to better vet this case and witness. Woodstock, GA-27March04, 4:25PM-A 48-year-old male resident of Woodstock reports that he had taken his vehicle to a repair shop in town near his home. While waiting, he went outside to enjoy the nice weather. He was looking at the sky and the scat- tered cumulus clouds when he noticed what appeared to be a dull grey-silver metallic sphere hovering seemingly just above the cloud tops to the north. He continued to watch, stating it was difficult to judge true size and distance, but it may have drifted slightly. This object was then covered by a cloud. The witness con- tinued to look, and within 5-10 minutes no- ticed an identical object, but possibly the original, a little east of the first location. An occasional cloud also covered this second observation off and on. Three or four jet aircraft at much higher altitude passed the area during the approximately 30 minutes of observation. The witness indicated in his WUFOD account that the size appeared to be about like an aspirin at arm's length. Also that his only conventional comparison would be to that of a balloon, but unlike balloons he had seen, these spheres seemed to have little or no drift. After about 30 minutes Page 16 the witness' vehicle was ready and he de- parted. He said he would provide additional in- formation if contacted by our personnel. Mark Kravitz of Marietta will be given this case information. Manchester, GA,16April04-At 10:20 PM, a 47-year-old female resident of Manchester, along with her 16-year-old daughter, reported they were driving home from Columbus. They arrived in the area of Ellerslie in Harris County, and while driving, observed what they thought was a helicopter from nearby Ft. Benning. Upon getting closer, she felt it re- sembled a Stealth bomber, with a triangle- like shape. Their closer observation found the witnesses slowing and letting down the vehicle windows which revealed no sound. The witnesses then observed the craft to be a dark triangle hovering at relatively, low altitude. Observed were blinking red and green lights at the rear, plus a project- ing spotlight-like beam, with an adjacent blue light under each \"wing.\" The daughter became a little concerned, stating that they needed to get out of there, continue on home, and tell her father. The mother stated that she had observed simi- lar triangular craft before, along with her older daughter, but had never reported it. MUFONGA's Dan Worsham of Co- lumbus has agreed to further investigate this incident. UFO \"Monster\" cases scheduled for TV Production work on a documentary fea- turing the 1955 invasion of \"little green men\" in the Kelly, KY, community is nearly complete and may be released this fall on cable television. The documentary is entitled \"Monsters of the UFO,\" which includes dramatiza- tions of three stories involving close en- counters with unexplained phenomenon. Director/producer Barry Conrad said it is \"highly probable\" that the documentary will air as a two-hour special on the Sci-Fi Channel, possibly around Halloween. The film will also include the Mothman incident in Point Pleasant, WV, and the Flatwoods Monster in Flatwoods, WV. MUFON Journal Canadian cow mutilation shakes farmer, neighbor Source: The Winnipeg Sun By Natalie Pona Staff Reporter An Arborg cattle farmer made a hor- rific discovery on Monday, April 26, when he found the partially skinned carcass of one of his animals that was apparently drained of its blood and missing its tongue. Gordon, who would allow The Sun to print only his first name, said, \"I don't re- ally want to speculate on what happened. I know what I saw,\" adding that he is still shaken up by the find. Arborg is 100 kilometres north of Winnipeg. The mutilation happened Sat- urday or Sunday night, Gordon said, not- ing that he has heard of several cow muti- lations in the area over the past few years. He called the Royal Canadian Mounted Police RCMP), reporting that the animal had been attacked by a predator. Gordon has since changed his mind about the cause. \"It was definitely a sharp object used,\" he said. Arborg RCMP Cpl. Glenn Syme said he has never investigated an instance of cattle mutilation. The RCMP did take a call this week about a cow being attacked by a predator, likely from Gordon. The animal was found with an incision under its chin. The skin had been pulled from the face, exposing the teeth. \"It's not the gore-we've seen that before-it's the evil behind it,\" Yvonne, a neighbor, said. The tip of the animal's tongue, cut from its root, was placed in the mouth, she said. \"There's not a drop of blood in that ani- mal. The only way you can drain an ani- mal of blood is (to cut into it) with the heart still pumping,\" she said, adding that the cuts were very precise, as if made by a surgeon. \"You don't know who you're dealing with,\" said Yvonne. \"The average wild and woolly neighbourhood brat wouldn't be capable of doing it.\" Gordon and Yvonne called Fern Belzil, an Alberta-based investigator of unex- plained deaths who has been studying cow mutilations for eight years, for help. Belzil has studied 100 cases, two-thirds of which remain unexplained. \"I'm not saying it's aliens ... a lot points towards aliens, but there is no proof,\" he said. Belzil said he has never encountered any evidence pointing to who or what is killing cows.

But the tragedy prompted vagueness as to the direction and intensity of piloted missions in the U.S. space-related research and de- velopment effort. Those views are part of the newly is- sued and wide-ranging Science and Engi- neering Indicators 2004, the 16th in the series of biennial reports conducted by the National Science Board (NSB). The NSB is an independent body estab- lished by the U.S. Congress in 1950 that oversees and guides the activities and poli- cies of the National Science Foundation (NSF) in Washington, DC. Within the NSB report, survey findings are presented that gauge U.S. public atti- tudes and understanding of issues in sci- ence and technology. Loss of Columbia The NSB report notes that loss of the Columbia space shuttle on Feb. 1 of last year did not have an immediate impact on public attitudes about the U.S. space pro- gram. However, the report observes that the loss of the space shuttle Columbia and its crew of seven \"resulted in uncertainty as to the future focus and intensity of manned missions in the U.S. space-related R&D effort.\" The report points to a Gallup survey conducted shortly after the Columbia trag- edy which indicated that 82 percent of re- spondents expressed support for continu- ing the manned space shuttle program. Only 15 percent favored ending the pro- gram. These findings are almost identical to those recorded after the loss of the Chal- lenger space shuttle in January 1986. NASA funding A majority of Americans surveyed con- tinue to support funding for NASA and the U.S. space program. Nearly half (49 percent) of those sur- veyed after the Columbia tragedy thought NASA's funding should be maintained at its current level, and one-fourth favored an increase in funding. In the same poll, 17 percent thought funding should be reduced, and another 7 'Your Videotape te Intriguing/but It still doeetft prove they exist.\" percent said the program should be ended altogether. These findings are not mark- edly different from data obtained in De- cember 1999. In the 2003 poll, as cited in the new NSB report, 45 percent of respondents rated NASA's job performance as excel- lent, and 37 percent rated it as good. Only two percent gave NASA a poor rating. In surveys conducted before 2003, no more than 26 percent of respondents ever rated NASA's performance as excellent (that high point occurred in 1998). The exceptionally high percentage of excellent ratings in 2003 may reflect the addition of the phrase \"looking beyond the tragedy\" to the survey question. Humans versus space robots Americans also continue to favor hu- man over robotic missions, the NSB re- port explains. After the loss of the Colum- bia, 52 percent of survey respondents said they favored manned missions, whereas 37 percent favored unmanned missions. Public opinion on manned versus un- manned exploration has changed little since 1990. In other survey questions posed after the loss of the Columbia, nearly 60 percent of respondents said they were \"deeply upset\" by the event (similar to response after the Challenger accident). About 70 percent said they had expected that \"something like this would happen again sooner or later.\" When respondents were asked about their confidence in NASA's ability to pre- vent similar accidents in the future, 38 per- cent expressed a \"great deal\" of confi- dence, and 44 percent had a \"fair amount\" of confidence. Again, this response is similar to that after the Challenger accident. Global warming or warning? On the topic of whether global warm- ing here on Earth is a problem, the NSB reports \"there is a three-way split in pub- lic opinion.\" That is, approximately equal numbers of respondents say it is a very serious prob- lem, a moderate problem, and a slight prob- lem-or not a problem at all. The NSB report continues: \"Whatever their view about the seriousness of global warming, more than half (51 percent) of Americans think its effects have already begun, and others expect to see effects within a few years (6 percent) or within their lifetime (12 percent). Only 10 per- cent said the potential effects of global warming \"will never happen.\" The NSB report adds that most Ameri- cans (61 percent) believe that human ac- tivities are more responsible for increases in the Earth's temperature over the last century than natural causes. Extraterrestrial visitors Under a subsection titled, \"Belief in Pseudoscience,\" the NSB's Science and Engineering Indicators report looks to pub- lic belief in visitors from afar. Based on studies conducted by NSF and other organizations, \"a sizable minority\" of the public believes in unidentified fly- ing objects and that aliens have landed on Earth. In a 2001 NSF survey, 30 percent of respondents agreed that \"some of the uni- dentified flying objects that have been re- ported are really space vehicles from other civilizations.\" For readers interested in viewing the full report, goto: http://www.nsf.gov/sbe/srs/ seind04/start.htm June 2004 MUFON Journal Page 17"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"By Jenny Randies Jenny Randies Strangers in Oz One of the things that I get asked the most is to explain why I came up with the concept of the Oz Factor and what I think it means for the UFO phenomenon If you do not recognise the term, do not worry. All will become clear. It started thirty years ago with one of the first cases that I followed up. In this a factory worker on the night shift had a close encounter with a very strange ob- ject. It was one of those things that leaves little room for doubt-a domed sau- cer-like object with windows that emit- ted an icy blue glow and that tilted on its edge and hovered next to the old mill. The witness was ada- mant that this could only be a UFO, by which, of course, he meant an alien space- ship. And I was pretty hard pressed to dis- agree with that analysis. However, something else struck me most about this particular case, and it stayed in my mind. There was a second security guard on duty at the factory that night. He was sufficiently close to the events that by all logic he could not have missed this remarkable sight. Yet he saw nothing. The more I thought this through and assessed the area surrounding the factory, the more puzzled I became. The case re- 'ceived a lot of publicity, and I expected dozens of witnesses to backup this man's story, for I had no doubt that he was tell- ing the truth. Countless houses were in full view of where this object had hovered, and yet no- body came forward to say that they had seen it. Was everybody somehow look- ing in the wrong direction? It was very late at night. Perhaps they were all asleep? Or, that nagging thought kept occurring to me, did this witness not see what he said that he had? Otherwise where was the support? Especially as in Page 18 later cases it failed to materialise even in broad daylight. Zone of influence I kept such ideas to the fore during the next two or three years, and something rap- idly became apparent-something I did not recall reading about in any of the UFO books that I had avidly consumed during my youth. Yet here it was, seeming to be a central feature of many close encounters. There appeared to be a zone of influ- ence surrounding these close encounters. If you were inside of it, then you experi- enced the episode in all its glory and as a total reality. If you were outside of it then the UFO sighting might as well have not happened. Even if the witness said that little aliens got out, formed a brass band, and gave a full concert before taking off again, nobody outside the zone of influence seemed to be capable of knowing a thing. A trip to Oz The more that I explored the growing number of close encounter cases that came my way, the more that I saw these subjec- tive elements were a key aspect of what witnesses were experiencing. I realized that you often had to find the right questions, or the witnesses would not tell you about these things. Partly it was because they themselves never saw them as significant. Mostly it was because they were afraid that they might detract from the credibility of their sighting, and that you might consider that they were imagining things. So far too of- ten these hidden features were not being reported unless you looked very hard for them. So I did try, and discovered that wit- nesses would report a whole series of symptoms that were common to close en- counters, but not to non close encounters. If someone saw a light in the sky or even had a mundane UFO encounter with a strange looking craft, then these things would rarely appear. But if they had a close encounter, then these symptoms were there more often than not. Witnesses would tell me that they felt a strange sensation prior to the encounter—a sort of mental tingling as if they were aware that something was about to happen. They • MUFON Journal would even tell me that they just had to look up and see what was there-as if it had called to them silently. Then I would be told that during the experience time seemed to disappear and lose all meaning. It was as if the encounter were happening in a timeless, magical void. Further clues kept popping up the more that I tabulated these cases. For instance, there were claims that at the onset of the episode all ambient sounds faded away- bird song, the wind in the trees, distant train noises, etc. All these clues pointed towards an iso- lation factor at work, as if the witness were being singled out and put into a cocoon whereby he or she could, experience the UFO, whereas anyone outside of it could not. As I started to work out the statistics for the cases that I had gathered, this sense of isolation became very obvious. What I called medium definition cases-where a clear object with structured shape was seen-had about 2.6 witnesses per case on average. They rarely relied on just the tes- timony of one person, and if you canvassed the area, then backup witnesses would fre- quently appear. When the case was a close encounter (which I defined not by distance, but by the presence of physical or physiological effects-such as car stops, burns marks etc) then the witnesses average was less than half of the previous figure (down to 1.2), and it was often impossible to find anyone else who saw anything, even if there were people in a position where they should have. Because this all suggested that the close encounter was somehow a witness-focused incident, I wanted a term to define this set of symptoms that kept cropping up. I used \"Oz Factor\" because what these people were describing was just like being taken out of our reality and put into a new. di- mension where magical things happened- rather like the land of Oz. So what does this mean? What did this information tell me about UFOs? Not, as is widely misunderstood, that UFO close encounters are imaginary. Quite the reverse seems true: the exist- ence of these things persuaded me more June 2004"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"than ever that these cases were real because it removed one major obstacle by defining a reason for the lack of backup witnesses. Moreover, the consistency of the wit- ness accounts of these symptoms was so great, despite the often reasonable reluc- tance of many people to share them with an investigator, that I was sure they were a very real effect. The Oz Factor implies that the UFO close encounter has a visionary component. You might interpret that as meaning it is all in the imagination, but it really means that there is a direct feed, if you like, from the source of the encounter to the con- sciousness of the witness. Something makes them pay attention by tuning out the normal sensory flow and looking up to watch the show. Where that show is being projected from remains the subject of great fascination. And it cer- tainly does not eliminate another intelli- gence as running this show. To me the Oz Factor is a vital key to the UFO mystery, and may help us to re- solve what is happening. We should not be afraid of its implications, just because they seem to suggest a fuzziness to the phenomenon. In truth we should embrace these cases. Indeed they seem to make a lot more sense when seen in the context of modern physics and our understanding of quantum reality, multiple dimensions, and relativ- ity. These fields are pretty weird and pro- duce consequences that science has been wrestling with for 100 years. That UFO close encounters exhibit equal strangeness is to me a sign that we\" are on track of the right answers. New object replaces Venus as second rock Astronomers announced May 20 the discovery of the second known asteroid whose orbit is completely inside that of Earth. It supplants Venus as the second rock from the Sun. Most asteroids orbit the Sun between Mars and Jupiter, but a handful cross the path of Earth on elliptical trajectories. One had previously been found to move com- pletely inside the annual path of our planet. The newfound rock, named 2004 JG6, is currently between Earth and Venus, and orbits the Sun every six months. But its elliptical path takes it well in- side the circle of Venus and even inside Mercury's path. On average, it is closer to the Sun than Venus. The asteroid is prob- ably no more than 0.62 miles wide and poses no danger to Earth. Retired priest says Catholic theologicans support ET Monsignor Corrado Balducci, a retired Catholic priest in Rome, Italy, who spe- cializes in demonology, has been quoted several times in the mass media to the ef- fect that UFOs exist, and that it is prob- able that there are entities in other worlds. While not officially representing Vatican thinking, he has apparently not been rep- rimanded by the Vatican for his views, and notes that other theologicans have also publicly supported the concept of entities on other planets. In an interview with Michael Hesemann, Monsignor Balducci said: \"UFOs—There must be something real about them. Everybody must come to this conclusion who approaches the question of extraterrestrial life with similar indi- vidual, social, and religious structures, and with reason and common sense. \"When we talk about extraterrestrials, we refer to humanoid beings which are, like us, of both a spiritual and a material nature, a physical body (for which they indeed need spacecraft), although in their case the relationship between mind and matter might be a different one than in our case... \"It is very well possible that other in- habited planets exist. We do not find any direct reference to extraterrestrial life in the Bible, but it neither excludes their ex- istence. Since God's wisdom and omnipo- tence has no limits and is infinite indeed, this possibility doubtlessly exists. \"The existence of other inhabited plan- ets is highly probable. The distance be- tween the angels, purely spiritual beings, and us, beings of spirit and matter, body and soul, is too large. \"Therefore it is highly probable that in between, between us and the angels, an- other life form exists, namely beings which still have a physical body, but one which is more perfect than ours and in- fluences the soul less in its intelligent acts and intentions... \"Several theologians consider it not only possible but very probable that out there in space, unreachable for our scien- tific instruments, other beings exist who recognize and venerate God since they re- alized this as the reason and meaning of their world and the creation itself... \"The inhabitability of other planets is not only possible and probable, but also desirable. In the future, even in a far dis- tant one, their possible inhabitants, if they are indeed superior to us, can help and support us in our spiritual development. In this way, which we cannot prove, they might have helped and protected us al- ready in the past... \"Pope John Paul II, when asked by a child, 'Holy Father, are there any aliens?' replied, 'Always remember: They are chil- dren of God just as we are.'\" Monsignor Balducci says other Catho- lic theologicans have shared similar be- liefs, and \"there exist several interesting statements on the inhabitability of other worlds by lay scientists, theologians, or servants of God who already qualified for a process of beatification or canonization. I'll limit myself to quote just some of them.\" Following is Monsignor Balducci's list: Beginning with the laymen, let me quote the great French scientist Charles Richet (1850-1935), who was, among other things, a materialist. In 1922, in his \"Traite de Metapsychique,\" he stated: \"Do we have any right to claim, just because of our lim- ited senses and our mistaken intelligence, that man is the only intelligent being in this immense cosmos?... That other in- tellectual forces, different from us, exist is not only possible but extremely prob- able. It is even certain... It is absurd to claim that we are the only intelligence in nature... The existence of these beings cannot be proven, but the probability of their existence is evident\" (loc. cit., Paris 1922, pp. 787-788). I remember five theologians: 1. Cardinal Nicolo Cusano (1401- 1464), philosopher and scientist, who said: \"We are not authorized to exclude that on another star beings do exist, even if they are completely different from us.\" 2. The Jesuit Father and astronomer Fr. Angelo Secchi (1818-1876) wrote: \"It is absurd to claim that the worlds sur- rounding us are large, uninhabited deserts and that the meaning of the universe lies just in our small, inhabited planet.\" 3. The famous Dominican preacher Jacques-Marie-Louis Monsabre (1827- 1907) referred to the principle \"Natura non facit saltus\" when he claimed that other intelligent beings besides men and angels exist.

Friedman Stan Friedman I get questions I believe that over the past 37 years that I have been lecturing about flying saucers I have probably answered at least 37,000 questions after lectures, in classrooms, and during radio and TV shows. Of course, normally it is the same ques- tions over and over again in different ven- ues. Now the internet brings me many more queries, again often the same ones re- peated. I thought it might be useful for me to deal with some of the cur- rent batch of FAQ. Q. When do you think the government will tell us what they know about fly- ing saucers? A. I have no idea, and see no release being imminent. Might as well throw darts at a dart board cal- endar. Q. What will it take to break the story? . A. I believe that if any major media group would put in 10% of the effort that went into blowing the lid off the political Watergate or into such \"important\" sto- ries as Monica Lewinski, Elian Gonzalez, or Gary Condit into blowing the lid off the Cosmic Watergate, it could be done in 6 months if they started with people like my- self, who have been visiting archives and using FOIA, and serious researchers like John Greenewald. Remember, though, that such an effort would mean admitting they had neglected the biggest story of the millennium for 57 years. It would mean putting up with the outrage of the nasty, noisy negativists of CSICOP and the SETI Cultists. After all, who needs radio telescopes to listen for signals' from distant civilizations when aliens are landing on and flitting around the planet? Q. Does this mean you are solidly be- hind the Disclosure Project? A. No, it does not. Yes, there is cer- tainly a cosmic Watergate.. .meaning that such agencies as the CIA, NSA, DIA, NSC, CIC, OSI, ONI have all withheld data. How many newsmen are aware of Gen. Carroll Bolender's comment, \"Re- ports of UFOs which could affect National Security are NOT part of the Blue Book System.\"? In the big Disclosure Project press con- ference many reliable people told their sto- ries, but no use was made of large-scale government-sponsored studies, such as the Congressional Hearings of July 29,1969, with Dr. Jim McDonald's 71-page block- buster paper; or of \"Project Blue Book Spe- cial Report 14\" with its 240 charts, tables, maps, and graphs clearly dealing with 3,201 sightings indicating that the better the quality of a sighting the more likely to be an UNKNOWN, and that the probabil- ity that the UNKNOWNS were just missed knowns was less than 1%, and that 21% of the cases were UNKNOWNS as op- posed to the 3% cited by the Secretary of the Air Force. How about the findings of the AIAA UFO Subcommittee that 30% of the 117 cases reviewed by the government spon- sored Condon Committee could NOT be identified? In addition, no use was made of the blacked out UFO documents released by the CIA and NSA, and the 156 NSA UFO documents on which only a couple of lines per page were not whited out, with the rest supposedly sources and methods data. I always get a fine response when I demon-, strate the cover-up instead of just talking about it. Furthermore, for reasons unknown, Dr. Steven Greer has loudly linked supposed free energy devices, which would solve the world's energy problems very rapidly and were supposedly based on recovered sau- cer technology, with the UFO cover-up. He has provided no such link, and has provided no evidence that such technology has been developed, or that if it has, it would be inexpensive. Energy from the sun is free, too, but converters are not. I have also not been favorably im- pressed by such items as Dr. Greer offer- ing a weekend briefing to a limited group of people for only $600. But the attendees would have to sign a nondisclosure-agree- ment. Sounds like a cover-up to me. Q. Don't you think we have learned a lot from recovered saucers? And from monitoring their flight? A. Yes, I think we have probably learned a great deal, many bits and pieces, from examining wreckage and then re-ex- amining it when newer analytical technol- ogy comes along. As an example in \"TOP SECRET/ MAJIC\" I cite the development of power- ful samarium-cobalt permanent magnets, and the fact that the original research was done at Wright Air Development Center, in Dayton, OH. I believe that instrument data obtained both by aircraft chasing, filming, and moni- toring UFO flight characteristics, and from ground and satellite monitoring, would also have provided information of importance. But one must be very careful here. Knowing how an atomic bomb works does not provide the required fissionable mate- rial or even the technology required to ma- chine explosives to very high tolerances. If Christopher Columbus had been pro- vided with a nuclear submarine in 1493, and an unlimited budget, he could not have duplicated it. Even my cheap digital Timex wristwatch could not have been duplicated 60 years ago. Note that it costs well over a billion $ for Intel to build a new chip fac- tory today. Q. Don't you think that all such newly discovered technology should be publicly disclosed? A. I have consistently stated that I do NOT believe that technology useful for military purposes should be put on the table where the nasty dictators or Osama Ben Ladens of the world, with lots of money, could get at it. Rule number one for security is that one cannot tell one's friends without telling one's enemies. They watch TV, and read newspapers and magazines. Flying saucers clearly make wonderful systems for deliv- ery of weapons and for defense.purposes. Q. Why are you not a fan of Colonel Corso? Isn't he an American Hero? A. I described my views some time back at my website www.v-j-enterprises.com/ sfpage.html. His book, The Day After Roswell, pro- vides no substantiation for the claims that he infiltrated alien technology into Ameri- Page 20 MUFON Journal June 2004"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"can industry from captured Roswell hard- ware.    '.••.. The four two-columned legal page ros- ter of the people working for General Trudeau at the Pentagon shows that there indeed was a two-man Foreign Technol- ogy group, and Lt. Col. Corso was the jun- ior officer in the group. He was not an en- gineer or a scientist. While working for Aerojet General Nucleonics, I directed a project we did for the USAF Foreign Technology Division at Wright Field in the early 1960s (Not about UFOs, but about Soviet space nuclear power technology). • FTD was a large organization with ac- cess to many technical people in industry. We know some of the Roswell wreckage went there in 1947.1 cannot believe it was stuck in a backroom somewhere. I am also, of course, disturbed by Corso's false claim that he was a member of the National Security Council (a very prestigious role). According to the Eisenhower Library, he was not only not an NSC member, but never attended a meeting. He also claimed to have been a range commander at White Sands Missile Range. The office there could not confirm this claim. His story of what happened at Fort Riley, KS, (alien bodies shown him) on July 6, 1947, sounds totally mythical. He claimed J. Edgar Hoover was a buddy. Hoover says Corso was a rat in his FBI file. His son says that nothing in the big pile of papers he left behind had been classified. And, no, I won't speculate on why he went public, other than to suggest there may have been a profit motive for the people involved. Since there is no linkage provided as to who was on the receiving end of the technology, he had nothing to lose. Q. How about the Mexican sightings released to the world by Jaimie Maussan in May? A. What is most impressive about this case, which got so much attention in mid- May, was that the source of the informa- tion was an official of the Mexican gov- ernment. There was testimony from mili- tary persons. There was data provided relating to two different instrument channels, radar and a Forward Looking Infra Red (FLIR)system. The sighting lasted longer than 30 minutes at an altitude greater than 10,000 feet. Multiple objects were seen by the instru- ments. I can't remember the last time a US government official was really cooperative with serious UFO researchers:The Bel- gian government did some sharing with local researchers more than 20 years ago arid, much more recently, the Chilean mili- tary has cooperated with civilian UFO re- searchers. I am reminded of the fact that accord- ing to the English Translation of the 90- page French COMET A report (I still have\" some copies at $ 10, including S & H from me at FOB 958, Houlton, ME 04730- 0958), the French authors seemed quite irritated that the US government hasn't shared any of the technology it gleaned from retrieval of the Roswell wreckage with the French-or apparently any other government. I find that the \"explanations\" for the Director's Message Continued from page 2) Some of the calls were from people working with space satellites, the drug en- forcement agency, and radar equipment. They all had known about the tracking of the objects since the day of the incident, but couldn't speak until the information was officially made public. Some of the things we heard were that the objects were first tracked by U.S. surveillance equip- ment. They were first thought to be drug distribution aircraft from South America, but later it was determined that was not the case. The use of FLIR (infrared) de- tection equipment was not limited to the Mexican Merlin C-26A aircraft. Many of our satellites, aircraft, and ground stations use infrared detection equipment as well as radar. Nothing approaches the United States without being tracked these days . What we did not learn and would still like to know is where the objects went af- ter flying over Mexico for 30 to 40 min- utes. As usual, the early debunking efforts were so ludicrous and unsubstantiated they added nothing of value to the investigation. Position Announcements Alabama State Director John Czerwinski has turned over the State Di- rector position to William Weeks. We all appreciate the excellent work done by John and appreciate the smooth transition of the leadership in Alabama. John con- tinues to be a MUFON member and will assist in the work being done there. Donald Burleson, State Director for New Mexico, announced the appointment of Miller Johnson as Assistant State Di- rector for New Mexico. In addition, Don appointed John Fegal to the position of State Section Director for Sandoval County. Mexican case offered by various \"scien- tists\" ludicrous. Space debris that flies in formation with an aircraft and is clearly under intelligent control? Eleven super-se- cret new visually-stealthy US aircraft flit- ting around over southern Mexico? Ball lighting lasting for 30 + minutes in flying formation and not visually seen, but picked up by the FLIR and radar? We know a lot about ball lightning. As a famous law- yer once said, \"If it doesn't fit, you must acquit.\" One other aspect that is important is that much of the press coverage (certainly not all) was surprisingly straight.

German Theologian Giuseppe Pohle: \"Hypothesis of the plurality of inhabited worlds is totally favorable to the glory of the Lord.\" I remember two individuals for whom their process of canonization is underway: 1.

The second (with whom I want to close this paper), is the already sanctified Padre Pio, who was beatified by Pope John Paul II on May 2, 1999, and canonised on June 16, 2002. From St. Fr. Pio, the following dialogue is documented and officially published by the Cappuchin Order: Question: \"Father, some claim that there are creatures of God on other planets, too.\" Answer: \"What else? Do you think they don't exist and that God's omnipotence is limited to this small planet Earth? What else? Do you think there are no other be- ings who love the Lord?\" Another question: \"Father, I think the Earth is nothing compared to other plan- ets and stars.\" Answer: \"Exactly! Yes, and we Earthlings are nothing, too. The Lord certainly did not limit His glory to this small Earth. On other planets other beings exist who did not sin and fall as we did\".

The daz- zling planet can be seen about 1 deg. above the star Aldebaran on July 3 and 4, and the lunar crescent lies near Venus on the 13th and 14th. Saturn (0.1), in Gemini, emerges in the morning sky about 4 AM during the last week. Look for it low in the ENE. Moon Phases: Full moon—July 2. Two full moons in one month. Second full moon called a \"blue moon.\" Last quarter—July 9 New moon—July 17 First quarter—July 24 Full moon—July 31 The Stars: On late summer evenings the Summer Triangle has climbed high up in the south- ern sky. That celestial arc-light of the sea- son, the star Vega, now crosses the sky's N-S meridian at a point almost directly overhead. From rural locations far from city lights, the faint hazy band of. billions of stars, the Milky Way, plunges southward across the teapot-shaped centaur of legend, Sagittarius the Archer. This constellation houses some of most magnificent deep-sky objects in the heavens. Sweep this region with binoculars or, better yet, with a tele- scope. Three of the blobs of light in the area are clouds of gas illuminated by clusters of stars-the Lagoon, Trifid, and Swan Nebulae. Other patches represent individual ga- lactic star clusters and the more compact globular clusters. Use a good star atlas to find and identify these objects. Cassini Orbits Saturn After a nearly seven-year journey em- ploying four gravity boosts from three dif- ferent planets, the U.S.-European Cassini spacecraft finally arrives at its interplan- etary destination-the spectacular ringed gas giant Saturn. Cassini will orbit the planet in a four- year study of Saturn's dense atmosphere, ring system, and multiple satellites. Next January the spacecraft will send a probe into the atmosphere of the solar system's largest moon, Titan, to study its chemis- try. Cold energy researcher murdered at home Dr. Eugene Mallove, 56, an outpoken proponent and researcher of cold fusion al- ternative energy, was murdered during a home invasion and robbery, according to police. Dr. Mallove, who has been a guest on Coast to Coast AM, was a leading re- searcher in alternative energy research, including zero-point, which may have a ^connection to retrieved and/or reversed en- gineered extraterrestrial technology. Dr. Mallove, who held degrees from MIT and Harvard, has a broad experience in high technology engineering at compa- nies including Hughes Research Labora- tories, TASC, and MIT Lincoln Labora- tory. He is the author of three science books for the general public, including the Pulitzer-nominated book on cold fusion, \"Fire from Ice: Searching for the Truth Behind the Cold Fusion Furor.\" Dr. Mallove recently said he was con- vinced it is only a matter of months before we will actually see a free energy device.

He never backed off from his views, despite extensive criticism, and wrote For- wards for three of UK researcher Timothy Good's books, including his latest, Un- earthly Disclosure. His often-quoted position on UFOs is summarized in the following state- ment,which he made in 1988: \"The evidence that there are objects which have been seen in our atmosphere, and even on terra firma, that cannot be accounted for either as man-made objects or as any physical force or effect known to our scientists seems to me to be over- whelming. .. \"There have been thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, of sightings and encoun- ters, physical results and of the latter, by people all over the world whose evidence on any other subject would be accepted without question.\" When he chaired a House of Lords in- vestigation into UFOs, Hill-Norton de- clared himself unimpressed on learning that the Ministry of Defence was in the habit of destroying accumulated evidence after five years. He was president of the Sea Cadets Association, the Defence Manufacturers Association and the British Maritime League, and Vice-President of the Royal United Services Institution. He was made a Freeman of the City of London in 1973. An obituary in the London Telegraph said, \"Almost from the beginning of his career some considered him destined ei- ther to be court martialled or to end up as First Sea Lord. \"His reputation for ruthless efficiency and meticulousness, combined with good luck and an irritating habit of being right, took him to the top. \"This made it seem all the more strange when, as a retired officer in the House of Lords, he placed rather more credence on the possible existence of unidentified fly- ing objects than did less talented individu- als.\" Immobilization device being developed HSV Technologies Inc., of San Diego, California is developing a non-lethal weapon that uses ultraviolet laser beams to harmlessly immobilize people and ani- mals at a distance. The Phaser-like device uses two beams of UV radiation to ionize paths in the air along which electrical current is con- ducted to and from the target. In effect, the beams create wires through the at- mosphere wherever they are pointed. !j- ^^^-: s •*\" °-=^ % ,_ _ C 1 - July 2-5-2004 UFO & Abduction C on ference, Ro s we 11,NM, featuring Bill Alnor, Stephen Bassett, Richard Dolan, Ann Druffel, David Flynn, John Greenewald, Mike Heiser, Jim Hickman, Joe Jordan, Eve Lorgen, Guy Malone, David Sereda, Chris Ward, and Jim Wilhelmsen. www.ancientofdays.net/ July 16-18-MUFON International UFO Symposium, Marriott SE, Denver, CO: \"Unconventional Flying Objects-The Body of Technological Evidence,\" featur- ing Stephen Bassett, Grant Cameron, Pe- ter Davenport, John Greenewald, Budd Hopkins, Leslie Kean, Deborah Lindemann, Nick Redfern, John Schuessler, David Sereda, Ryan Wood, George Zeiler.

The current within these beams is a close replication of the neuro-electric im- pulses that control skeletal muscles. It is imperceptible to the target person because it differs from his own neural impulses only in that its repetition rate is sufficiently rapid to tetanize muscle tissue. (Tetanization is the stimulation of muscle fibers at a frequency which merges their individual contractions into a single sustained contraction.) No retinal damage can occur because the cornea absorbs all ultraviolet radiation at the wavelengths used. Moreover, the beams are too weak to produce photokeratitis (corneal inflammation) un- less they are directed at the eyes for sev- eral minutes. In addition, the current they transmit is insufficient to affect the muscles of the heart and diaphragm. The electrical beam weapon has a far longer potential range than its nearest competitor, the wire-based Taser® . Successful proof-of-principle tests have been performed at the University of California at San Diego, and further re- finements using novel laser designs are forthcoming. Although the smallest laser now avail- able for this application is the size of a carry-on suitcase, a hand-held version is expected. Also under development is an engine- disabling variation for use against the elec- tronic ignitions of automobiles. The en- gine-disabling version would operate with off-the-shelf lasers and be carried aboard police patrol cars and helicopters."}]
