The next major UFO flap may well be on its way. by Joseph W. Ritrovato M y UFO experience began in a very personal way while only just a boy of ten. It was a crystal clear night in the fall of 1965, sometime between Labor Day and the Great New York Blackout. Something caused me to wake up and turn to look out the window. In the distant sky I caught sight of an elongated object about fifty feet in length and was immediately entranced by its large brilliant lights that shifted in and out of my vision. The craft was hovering about 1,200 feet off the ground and around one-and-a-half miles southeast of my home in Medford, Long Island, New York. Shortly after my discovery, one of two jets roared into view on an inter- cept course, the first coming from the northeast and the other eventually from the west. While the first jet was still a good distance from the target the silent visitor shifted smoothly, as if in no hurry, from a horizontal po- sition to a tilt of 30 to 45 degrees, and, after a pause of about two seconds, shot off faster than the eye could fol- low. Many years later, on an evening in October 1973, while home on leave following boot camp, one of my brothers had an even closer encounter when he saw a UFO fly over our home, then in the Mohawk Valley of Schoharie County, upstate New York. Unfortunately, during the excitement outside, this writer was busy tin- kering in the basement. By the time I learned what the commotion was all about and rushed outside with my spotting scope, it was already miles away, fading out of sight just over the horizon. Not much detail could be dis- cerned, but the formation and behavior of the lights did not bring a common aircraft to mind. Instead, it re- minded me of a thrilling spectacle witnessed eight years before. My brother's excitement following the event reminded me of my own back then, yet for some reason I either chose not to pry him for details, or the story faded from my memory since the experience was much more his than mine. Unfortunately, cancer took his life five years ago and it is therefore too late to now learn more of the facts. Perhaps he knew what was up that season, but it wasn't until much later that it occurred to me how I had been caught off guard in the midst of a UFO wave. Two years ago a friend informed me that Europe had recently been having a rash of UFO sightings. While vis- iting Brussels, Belgium in the late summer of 1991, 1 was unaware that just over one year before their own air force jets were chasing UFOs. Although I often scan the local papers for unusual events, any word related to the excitement in that country had eluded me. After a thor- ough CD-ROM search the only item from the major local daily that could have informed me was in a column of statistical trivia from a Sunday paper early in 1991. Buried therein was the reported number of sightings (2,600) of a triangular UFO over Belgium the year be- fore. While disappointing, it appears to be common for the major newspapers to deprive us of comprehensive coverage on such stories. It would seem that this media source normally becomes interested in UFOs only if a target is needed for a few laughs on a slow news day. It was time, I decided, to break through the disquieting si- lence from the established sources of \"The NEWS\" (which originally was intended to cover all the angles, North-East-West-South) and get the lowdown myself. Since then I've gleaned information from over fifty books and read many articles from the best of the peri- odicals on the subject, the MUFON UFO Journal in- cluded. During my investigation into the UFO phe- nomenon all promising sightings were collected from ancient times to the present to see if any noticeable pat- terns would arise. Nobody (to my knowledge) has been able to claim success in predicting UFO waves consis- tently, but this could be explained by many periodic factors interacting rather than just one or two wave forms. Based on my research, it appears as though at least three separate cycles peaking in close proximity are necessary to produce a pronounced wave effect. Although the clues that were uncovered seemed to sup- port this theory, pinning down the movement of as many as ten cycles and the times of their possible interaction made prediction complicated. Only within the last few months did enough of the right pieces fall into place for me to realize that some effect of real significance should be on the horizon. Not long before reaching this point, I was ready to take the easy way out and plan a UFO search during the next Mars opposition (Mars passed closest to Earth on February 11-12). As it turns out, though, the present window for viewing UFOs started opening up at about the time favorable viewing of the planet Mars began (December 20, 1994, when the red planet entered the one-eighth part of its current orbit that comes nearest to our own planet). Thus, whether it be a fluke or a factor, the planet Mars seems to have signalled the start of hunting season for the elusive Unidentifieds in the sky. Before listing prospective search periods for 1995, let me share the sources of my discoveries. In Challenge to Science: The UFO Enigma, Jacques & Janine Vallee found statistical significance for an approximately 13- month cycle, or half of the roughly 800-hundred-day cy- cle that has often coincided with Mars oppositions. MARCH 1995 NUMBER 323 PAGE 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Jenny Randies in \"Anatomy of a UFO Wave,\" an article printed in the International UFO Reporter (CUFOS) of March/April 1986, makes a good case for a periodicity of 21 to 22 months. Prior to finding this material, my re- search resulted in a proposed cycle 50% longer than Randies' or 32 months in length. This proportional re- lationship revealed the likelihood of a smaller cycle fit- ting twice into her cycle or three times into mine. The late Coral E. Lorenzen of APRO (Aerial Phenomena Research Organization) was perhaps the first person to claim that waves came in cycles of ap- proximately five years in length (per her UFOs â€” The Whole Story, 1969). Interestingly, three of the 21+ month, or two of my 32- month cycles, yield 64 months (five years and four months). Author John A. Keel, in his book Operation Trojan Horse, suggested that there was a cycle of exactly seven days in length (or a multiple of that) which would ac- count for his \"Wednesday Phenomenon,\" or peaks in his collected reports for the years 1966 and 1967 that oc- curred most often on Wednesdays. Yet, if you look at Keel's cross section of reports for each day of the week, you see a uniform decrease from Wednesday forward through the week to Tuesday, which implicated a phase shifting to other days uniformly through time. In other words, if the peak was always on Wednesday, then it should drop off before and after that day like a reflected image or as presented in a bell curve. Following Mr. Keel's lead, I refined his estimation of when the short cycle repeats itself. Some devotees of the UFO phenomena who are com- mitted to the Extra-Terrestrial Hypothesis, or ETH, may discount the possibility of any periodicity. As justifica- tion they might point to Vallee and Keel, who support the wave phenomenon as a real aspect worth serious study, but frown on an extraterrestrial connection as if both cannot be right. However, I am not convinced that these two possible aspects of the UFO problem can't both be involved in the solution. I n my view there is a periodic element (separate from psychological factors) that can be linked not only to UFO manifestations, but to other strange phenomena (or even tectonic events) as related by John Keel and Jacques Vallee. In theory, this common factor would trigger the likelihood of experiencing any of these events. Yet, since it only triggers them and is not the root mech- anism, it would not necessarily exclude an extraterrestrial relationship to at least some UFO visitations. It is here suggested that periodic geomagnetic fluc- tuations magnify the effects of certain areas on the earth's surface acting as windows to other dimensions of existence. Aliens could be using the earth as a base of operations and normally not be detected since they exist on another dimensional plane that is usually beyond our senses of perception. During my search for dis- cernible patterns a cyclic component to UFO appear- ances became more and more convincing. I am not dis- counting as factors at least some randomness, or even mass suggestibility or hoaxes that can artificially form a grouping following an initial sighting. For these reasons, the data have been selected with care (placing the em- phasis on quality rather than quantity) and the proposed cycles introduced here were persistently tested. C ombining all presently active cycles. 1 foresee the following: Most of the year, or December 1994 through September 1995, will show an increase in ob- served UFOs. However, sightings during the first and last two and one half months of this period are expected to average only about half the number anticipated during the five central months. The best viewing should be during the entire spring season (perhaps starting as much as a few weeks before the spring equinox), but most especially on every other Friday through Sunday from the second weekend in April to the third weekend in May. Of course the timing of this depends on the accuracy of the estimates of when each cycle peaks. However, it is expected that if the wave crest doesn't oc- cur at the end of April it should be no more than three weeks from that time. No matter what the exact date will be, the wave should be felt primarily throughout all or most of this spring and present the best season for a pos- sible sighting this year and probably for a few years to come. January should have been the month that the longest or 5+ year cycle crested, the 13-month cycle' peak is due to arrive in April (as early as the sixth or as late as the twentieth), and the 21+ and 32-month peak is expected in mid-June of this year (around the third weekend). During the most intense phase of the wave period it is estimated that the shortest cycle will peak around Saturday (give or take a day). To clear up any possible confusion here, it would be important to explain that although the 21+ and 32- month cycles seem to remain in sync (or nearly so) with each other every 64 months, their interaction with the 5+ year cycle becomes more remote with each pass- ing phase. In other words, since the alignment of all three in 1952, they've been growing further apart at the rate of as few as 12 days (for the 21+ month cycle) or as much as 20 days (for the 32-month cycle) after the culmination of each 5+ year period. This latter cycle may be considered more like 61 months in length by the majority of cycle watchers, but in the course of my studies a 63-64 month frequency emerged that appears to fit the data better (compare either period to the waves of '52, '57, '73 and '89). My estimate for the last appearance of the 5+ year cy- cle matches the start of the Russian wave (late September, 1989). The 13-month cycle would have peaked just afterwards, when the Canadians had record sightings in October of that year. The 32-month cycle should have been at its greatest intensity during late January or early February, 1990, and the 21+ month PAGE 4 NUMBER 323 MARCH 1995"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Overlay of Currently Active UFO Cycles AL o 8 I i O Q.

(The UFO invasion of Belgium began in November 1989, with the best reports from late November of '89 to late March '90.) However, as many as three other cycles could have been influencing matters during the 1989 to 1990 period. These other cycles are not likely to affect matters this time and are therefore not discussed here. Since 1947, about one out of every five years has been a wave year. Of these, around one out of every five waves is a great wave. If the U.S. Air Force had not shut down Project Blue Book in 1969, and were still evalu- ating UFO sightings, an average non-wave year would bring in around 500 reports. In contrast to this, the less frequent wave year would yield about 1,000 reports (as derived from Blue Book's yearly total report tallies from 1953-1968). However, since a wave usually only lasts a few months or weeks, the portion of the year where the wave primarily manifests shows an increase of approximately three times greater than normal (based on the monthly average for a wave with an intense phase lasting three months). For a great wave, the most active months would produce sightings more like six times greater than normal (or even beyond that; the head of Blue Book during the great wave of 1952 stated that at the height of the flap they were receiving 20 or more reports a day with Unknowns comprising 40% of all reports). It would have been considered normal if Blue Book had collected 43 reports in a given month, but if they had 129 reports, that would have been con- sidered a typical wave month (or \"flap\" as they termed it). Do not be surprised if we experience similarly large numbers in the coming spring months. O nly about one out of ten sightings is truly a UFO while, at the same time, it is commonly believed by researchers that no more than one out of ten sightings ever get reported. Because of this situation, I estimate that the above Blue Book figures give a good estimate of what the total number of true UFOs would be in the United States under ideal circumstances. In other words, these numbers would come close (although probably a conservative estimate) to the figure of remaining Unidentifieds if all sightings were reported, contained sufficient information for evaluation, and were thor- oughly researched. However, the total reports for the year 1952 appear lower than they should be. Edward J. Ruppelt conveyed in his The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects (1956) that while heading Blue Book in July of 1952, they were so busy with incoming reports that they had no time to investigate or evaluate the for- eign reports that were arriving. Also, Ronald D. Story in his The UFO Encyclopedia gives a figure almost 30% greater than Blue Book's final official estimate of the to- tal sightings for that year. There is one factor not considered in the estimates above that could significantly effect the true figure. Normally a witness to a UFO is totally caught off guard by the experience. If a few thousand people had ad- vance knowledge of when a wave would occur and acted on that information, what would happen? If people in such numbers scheduled a few hours a week during the most intense phase of the coming wave to search the skies, the reported sightings during those months might be twice that of what a typical wave year would bring. So, under the proper circumstances, a regular wave could become a great one. But timing isn't quite every- thing; location is important as well. An experienced researcher should already know the hot spots to camp out at, but for most everyone else a study of the historical record of activity can help pin down a good prospective area. As a start in this direc- tion, the Blue Book record of unknowns, when broken down by state and after factoring in population den- sity, would rate as follows. The states that would be la- beled \"top contenders\" include New Mexico, Montana, and North Dakota. Still, \"very good prospects\" can also be found in the states of New Hampshire, the District of Columbia, Maine, Mississippi. Alaska, Colorado. Oregon, Delaware, Wisconsin, and Texas. The remain- ing \"just above average\" states include Ohio, Idaho, Maryland, Iowa, Virginia, Michigan, Florida, California. Arizona, Massachusetts (Boston area), New Jersey (sur- rounding Newark), Kansas, and Oklahoma. In regards to this list I feel it best to reveal a contro- versial decision I made which affected its ordering. Reports for the period of 1947 to 1952 were excluded since it appeared as if UFOs during that time were tar- geting the areas from the state of Washington, south through Oregon and California, and east through Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico. When data was selected for only the years following 1952, three of these states dropped significantly in their standing (down one or more categories), while New Mexico and Oregon remained constant. Although some fault can be found for this decision, I still feel that it gives a more accurate dis- tribution for a preliminary list, especially in assigning the states with the highest ranking. I t should also be pointed out that some of the states' ratings could have dropped slightly if there were a large number of military reports since they were as- signed a lower value than civilian ones. The reason for this is that often military sightings are from jets in iso- lated areas of little or no population (especially Alaska), or at high altitude, when there would normally be no chance to witness the UFO. Also, some states in the last category were moved up in rank due to exceptional cir- cumstances. For example, in the states of Massachusetts and New Jersey, four of the five unknowns were all lo- cated within a strip of land that ranged between one and two percent of the total land area of each state. In Michigan, by the same ratio, the Unknowns were in ar- eas of very low population density, much less than the PAGE 6 NUMBER 323 MARCH 1995"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL state average and thus deserving of a higher position. California was also raised up due to strong, though cir- cumstantial evidence of bias on the part of Blue Book following the Cisco Grove (near Truckee) close en- counter of September 1964. The last Unknown listed for California was three weeks before this sighting, even though 1965 through 1967 was an exceptional wave period. For those not familiar with this report, it started with a lost hunter becoming stranded up a tree due to at least two aliens and a robot bent on abducting him. He first attempted to chase the invaders away by shooting arrows at the robot and, when that failed, frantically set torn pieces of his clothes on fire and threw these down upon them. This ploy may have granted him some sense of security until he found that there was no more ammunition to spare. Not surprisingly, Blue Book la- beled the report \"Psychological.\" Based on the fre- quency of reports prior to the apparent bias, there should have been at least four more Unknowns and California's rank was raised accordingly. It can be pointed out here that Hynek and Vallee list a total of four very good re- ports during this void period. There may be other states that deserve additional consideration for possible position adjustment (perhaps Washington state, for example), but that would require more time than I had available. The states that I chose to investigate were those that looked obviously too low or too high on the ladder based on my prior knowledge of sightings for those areas. Since my rating approximation has its limitations, one should not necessarily feel left out if your home state is not included. For example, even though Pennsylvania is not listed, the southeastern part of that state has had many good reports in the past (mostly on a line from Middletown to Easton & Jonestown to Willow Grove; see David Saunders' UFOs? Yes! on Orthoteny). Similarly, the vast majority of sightings in North Carolina are concentrated in the lower half of that state. During the wave of 1989 to 1990, there were over two hundred sightings in the region of Fyffe, Alabama. In New York, many people believe that on November 24, 1992, a UFO crashed into a remote area of South Haven Park adjoining North Shirley on Long Island. Curiously, this date and the time of my encounter in 1965 (the UFO was then hovering just three miles west of the ap- parent crash sight), were sandwiched between a 13 and 32-month peak (averaging 8-9 weeks to either one), al- though November 1992 is when I estimate another cycle (not discussed here) had peaked. There was a flurry of activity in Stonewood (not far from Clarksburg), West Virginia during the months of September and October 1993. West Virginia may not usually rate very high in its average frequency of sightings but would no doubt earn an elevated position if it were being considered in the category of high strangeness reports (see John A. Keel's The Mothman Prophecies). I n a like manner, states ranked in the lower, \"just above average\" category should not be underestimated. From December 1993, through May 1994, equipment set up by seismologists in Parkfield, California, recorded un- usual magnetic changes. Besides a possible relation- ship to the January earthquake in Northridge, there may have been a UFO connection as well. During the period of the magnetic anomalies there were increased sightings in Ventura (primarily), and Santa Barbara counties. In the middle of this period was a 13-month cycle peak (also in line with 125 witness reports from western Michigan for March 7-21, 1994). And California may just end up riding atop the next incoming wave. At the dawn of the proposed period of increased sightings, two newsworthy events occurred 1 within California that just might be UFO related. On December 14, a mysterious blackout effected seven western states and British Columbia. There was no mas- sive power consumption or storm to account for the disruption. But some problem developed along a 60- mile stretch of 500-kilowatt line between Fresno and Tracy, triggering a glitch to develop in the power switches at either the Los Banos or Coalinga substations, and causing the \"Pacific intertie transmission system\" to shut down at 12:26 a.m. Less than twelve hours later, at just before noon of the same day, an unusual crash of a Learjet into Fresno occurred, killing both pilots and in- juring at least fifteen people. The jet was returning from a military exercise with the state's Air National Guard when one and then, in less than a minute, the other en- gine failed. The civilian aircraft was acting as a target in the training mission and was said to have been carrying sophisticated radar equipment. Lastly, perhaps the experimental NASA X-31 super- sonic jet was chasing a UFO before it crashed in the desert north of Edwards AFB on January 19, 1995 (this air base has had some impressive UFO reports in the past). While reportedly wrapping up a test flight of the aircraft, specifically designed to greatly increase ma- neuverability, the test pilot had to eject himself to avoid sudden death. The news stories went into surprising detail as to the jet's dimensions, the number of these jets and pilots assigned to them at Edwards, the special qualities and design features of this craft, and the name of the manufacturers. One noticeable omission was any possible reason for the crash or the time of its occur- rence. Do more frequent and even stranger events lie ahead? In whatever location one may be, the best general area to dig-in for a lengthy UFO vigil would be on top of a large hill overlooking a sizeable body of water (high- voltage power lines in sight is also a plus), at or close to a place having a history of reliable sightings over a long period of time.

Western Montana has been the site of several recent cattle mutilations. by Keith Wolvertoii and Thorn Danenhower INTRODUCTION Cattle mutilations are not new to the western United States or Montana. Beginning in late August 1975, they were a common occurrence in Montana and other west- ern states into the mid-1980's. Mutilation reports dimin- ished at that time; it is thought by longterm researchers such as Wolverton and Howe that mutilations probably have continued, but that reporting of mutilations dimin- ished due to rancher's frustrations with the lack of ex- planation for these events. Recent cattle mutilation reports appear to be increasing from the western Montana area; there was one report in December of 1993, and there were 2 reported cattle mutilations from the Cutbank, Montana area reported in the Great Falls Tribune from September 29, 1994. The authors have worked on 2 additional mu- tilations which occurred in the first three weeks of November 1994. In 1993 cattle mutilations were more common in the southeastern part of the country. These are reported on in an excellent documentary video by Linda Howe Productions entitled Strange Harvests 1993. Other mutilations were reported from the San Luis Valley in Colorado and northern New Mexico in the spring of 1994, and are ongoing in Colorado. MONTANA MUTILATIONS Mutilations reported in Montana in the fall of 1994 have taken place in the north-central region. On the Proefrock Ranch a bull had its stomach sliced and re- productive organs mutilated. On the Pfeifer Ranch an- other bull was found dead with similar mutilations. Both of these ranches are near the northern Montana town of Cutbank. The area has not had many reported mutilations since the 1970s, when Pfeifer had a similar loss. Pfeifer also noted that in the case of his bull coyotes in the area had not predated the bull and were keeping their distance. On November 7, 1994, a mutilated cow was discov- ered by Scott Houston of Great Falls, Montana while deer hunting in the central part of the state, near Winnet. The cow was lying on its left side with legs up in the air about 2 miles due north of Petrola Lake and was dis- covered around 3:00 p.m. The right side of the cow's face was removed, but the right eye and tongue were left intact. There was also some meat left on the jawbone. The udder bag and anus were removed. There was no blood, no tracks, no sign of a struggle, and nothing else unusual reported about the site. The cow was lying near a salt block and a fence. Scott felt the cow was 2-3 days old when discovered; the tentative date for muti- lation and death would be November 4-5, 1994. The cow was a 5-year-old Red Angus and an excellent calf producer. Surveys of the cow 2-3 weeks after discovery indicated no predation other than a possible missing tongue. A four-year-old Black Angus heifer was reported mutilated to Cascade County Sheriff Captain Steve Whitmore on November 29, 1994; Sheriff Whitmore investigated the mutilation at 8:00 a.m. on November 30, 1994. Whitmore placed the date of mutilation at some- time between the 20th and 29th of November. The cow was found near Montana Highway 89 about five miles northwest of its junction, with Montana Highway 200. The cow had flesh and skin cleanly removed from the left side of its head, most of the left ear removed, pos- sibly part of the left eye removed, had a rectal core, and had several of the udders cut off cleanly part way up, leaving stubs. The nose soft tissue was removed down to bone; a fetus was not removed from the cow as it had just conceived. The right eye and right ear were intact. The cow was again investigated by the writers and Whitmore on December 20, 1994. Wintertime condi- tions had kept the cow fairly fresh, but the cow had been damaged by extensive predation; soft tissue in- cluding the udder bag and a large amount of the right rear leg were missing. Due to these conditions, the writ- ers concentrated efforts on the head area and mutilation cuts in this area. It is best to study mutilated cows within 48 hours of death; in this case the cow was too old and predated to do much except work on the jaw and head area. Membranes and ligament next to the mutilated jawbone were freshly torn in a small area, presumably by predators. Mutilation cut and adjacent hair samples were taken from the rectal and facial areas. The cow was found lying on its right side near a fence in the southwestern corner of a fenced pasture. The pasture was in stubble on fine-grained, silty, greenish- gray lake sediment which showed no tracks, prop wash, or any other unusual signs of disturbance. The sandy clay substrate was frozen; the cow had made a slight in- dentation where it was lying; the substrate could have melted due to body heat thawing the soil and com- pressing it somewhat. The cow was possibly put in this spot while still warm. The soil was generally dry, and we did not leave any foot prints. Fox scat was found near the head of the cow.

The mutilators' cuts clearly have a heated, melted appearance with some of the nearby black hair slightly melted at the end. This hair shows a very slight bulging and partial melting at ter- minal ends. There are also straw and sand grains em- bedded in the melted adipose tissue of the cuts. The quartz sand grains and straw particles in the cuts seem compatible with sources immediately adjacent to the cow. The cut shows the fairly regular pinking-shear /cookie-cutter pattern found in many mutilations. Experiments conducted with a heated cutting instru- ment and hair samples taken from the cow reproduced melted hair similar to that found in hair next to the mu- tilators' cuts. The best match was at a temperature of 400 degrees Fahrenheit. This compares favorably to re- search done by Meyers and Howe showing damaged tis- sue adjacent to mutilation cuts was heated to 350 de- grees F. (See Earth Mysteries, Alien Life Forms, Howe Productions). The mutilation cuts are markedly rounded, show no jagged pieces of hide hanging off, and show evidence of heat. The adipose tissue of the hide has been melted, and hairs have fallen into it, embedding in the temporarily melted tissue. Some of the hairs show bleaching as well and were al- most clear. The hairs show large amounts of bulging at tempera- ture above 400 degrees F. and appear not to melt at 300 degrees F. The bleached-looking hair, almost clear in na- ture, has not been replicated; it is also possible this ma- terial is part of a weed seed or some other contaminating material; it does appear to be similar in size to the black hair in samples, and occasionally shows the same melt- ing on the ends as the black hair adjacent to the mutila- tion cuts. In consulting with local medical experts, who use lasers regularly for surgeries, lasers, even those used for delicate internal surgeries, leave some carbon rind near the cut. Since there was no precipitation between the time of mutilation and the investigation, the writers should have seen evidence of a carbon rind if a laser was PAGE 10 NUMBER 323 MARCH 1995"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL used to make the mutilation cuts. These experts also stated lasers in use for surgery today are large, heavy in- struments requiring large amounts of power. There are less powerful hand-held lasers in use for optical and distance measuring applications, as well as for medical purposes, but not for cutting on items as thick as cowhide. These do not have the power necessary to make large-scale incisions. Whatever made the cuts was powerful enough to neatly cut cowhide 1/8-3/16th of an inch thick. Although most mutilation cuts show evidence of heat, some do not. In a mutilation case from the Ball Ranch near Briggsdale, Colorado, investigated in Jate 1979 by lona Hoeppner, the cuts showed no evidence of heat damage. In fact, with microscopic examination the cells showed no disruption at all; the mutilators were able to make a precise enough cut to go between cell tissue. There was no blood loss or fluid leakage in this case ei- ther; this is typical and one of the fascinating mutilation mysteries. Hoeppner also found a foreign fluid associated with the mutilated areas; this fluid kept flies off these ar- eas for a couple of weeks. The fluid was clear, had a pinkish tinge, did not soak in to the ground right away, and revealed a crystalline structure when examined mi- croscopically. Predators also avoided mutilated areas of this cow. doing scavenging in non-mutilated areas. CONCLUSION Mutilated cattle reports appear to be on the rise in west- ern Montana. The writers hope to set up a reporting system for mutilations in order to be able to conduct de- tailed investigations within 48 hours of the time of death. Evidence from the Black Angus cow investi- gated by the writers on December 20, 1994 shows heat damage in the cut area; partially melted hair was repli- cated using a cutting instrument heated to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. There was a noticeable lack of the carbon rind associated with laser made cuts. Microscopic in- vestigation of the cuts showed marked differences from sample cuts made with a knife by the writers. The mu- tilation cuts show noticeable rounding and smoothness when compared to jagged, sharp-cornered knife cuts. The area where the cow was found showed no tracks or disturbance; and it is possible that the cow was dropped from the air. It appears the cow might still have been warm when placed at the site of discovery as evidenced by a depression under the cow and possible melting of frozen ground. This mutilation is quite unusual due to extensive amounts of predation taking place. This pre- dation made it impossible to investigate mutilation dam- age completely, causing the writers to concentrate efforts in the head and jaw mutilation area.

MUFON UFO INFORMATION CENTER By the time Journal readers have an opportunity to read this short announcement, MUFON will have opened our new \"UFO Information Center\" in the Colonial Park Complex in Seguin, Texas. Occupying 500 sq. ft. in an office complex along the major north-south highway through Seguin, this is our re- sponse to the many requests received from interested people who would like to visit our headquarters office to see our photo exhibits, displays, library, video pro- grams, and UFO sales items. Obviously, these ex- hibits are too extensive to display in the two offices that constitute our MUFON administrative head- quarters at 103 Oldtowne Road. We are very excited about our new information center and exhibit, since it complies with one of MUFON's major objectives â€” UFO public education. How do visitors find us? Interstate Highway 10 skirts Seguin along the north side and Interstate Highway 35 is only 14 miles to the northwest. Seguin is 35 miles east of San Antonio and 160 miles west of Houston, TX on I.H. 10, the major east-west interstate across the southern U.S.A. We are only 14 miles S.E. off the major north-south I.H. 35 at New Braunfels (S.H. 46) and 22 miles south at San Marcos (S.H. 123), that runs from Canada to Mexico across the middle of the United States. Now that you know where Seguin, TX is located, let's get more specific. If you are driving on I.H. 10, take exit 610 south on Bypass S.H. 123 for two miles and you have arrived. (The exact address is 628 North Highway 123 Bypass, Suite 3, along the west side of the divided parkway.) If you are on I.H. 35 at San Marcos, drive south on S.H. 123 for 22 miles to find us. If you should exit I.H. 35 at New Braunfels. proceed SW for less than 14 miles on S.H. 46 to its intersection with I.H. 10 and then proceed east fol- lowing the I.H. 10 directions above. As you drive south on S.H. Bypass 123, look for the large blue on white sign in front of the office complex with the an- nouncement \"UFO INFORMATION CENTER.\" The information center has another large blue on white sign on the top of the building above the office com- plex double doors stating \"MUFON\" and \"Mutual UFO Network.\" There is plenty of parking available for visitors. If visitors happen to arrive when the in- formation center is not open, please go to the nearest pay telephone and call 379-9216. As they say in Texas \"Y'all come and see us.\" Warren \"Ed\" Benjamin, State Section Director from Wichita Falls, TX, has the distinction of being the first visitor to sign the registration book. If by chance you fail to take these directions with you on your trip, please call MUFON at (210) 379-9216 or go to the Chamber of Commerce office at 427 North Austin Street in Seguin for directions.

New Mexico, in July 1947. remains cloaked in mystery and controversy despite extensive, serious research. As most readers already know, the Roswell Incident has been scrutinized from every pos- sible angle. One such angle is the testimony of eyewit- ness Major Jesse Marcel (who died in 1986). along with the corroborating testimony of both his wife and son. In July 1947, Major Marcel was one of the first two military officers at the debris site. En route back to the base, his car loaded with debris, he stopped off at home to show his wife and 11-year-old son, Jesse, Jr., several of the unusual pieces. Later he would say that the ma- terial \"was not of this earth.\" To this day. Jesse, Jr., re- members being wakened late that night to look at the strange material his father had brought home. He recalls in particular an I-beam-like structure and the hiero- glyphic-style characters occupying the inner surface of one side of the I-beam. For those of us interested in uncovering the truth about Roswell. finding this original I-beam would be a dream come true. Its molecular structure could be ex- amined and its mysterious symbols studied. However, until the U.S. military and/or government changes its policy of denial concerning Roswell, we may never see the actual material. Until that time, we will have to be satisfied with a replica based on the best information available. In October 1994. I attended a ceremony at the Roswell UFO Museum to dedicate a plaque to the mu- seum's founding members. While there, I told museum officers Glenn Dennis. Walter Haul, and Max Littell about my plan to create an I-beam replica that could be displayed at the museum. As an industrial designer, it was a challenge I couldn't resist. The museum officers liked my idea, and that was all the encouragement I needed. PAGE 12 l-beain u'flica created in conjunction with Jesse Marcel.

Because I needed information and he needed creative talent, we decided to pool our efforts. On December 3, Kent set up a three-way conference call be- tween Dr. Marcel (Major Marcel's son, now a physi- cian in Montana and a National Guard helicopter pilot and flight surgeon), Kent in Atlanta, and me in Albuquerque to formulate a plan for replicating the I- beam. Kent and I were both convinced that working with Dr. Marcel, one of two known surviving eyewit- nesses, wasâ€”as far as this project was concernedâ€”our ace in the hole. Without his recall, the project would not have been possible. There has been a great deal of controversy over the I- beam's physical properties. Was it balsa wood, terrestrial material, or something else? In 1947, just one month short of 12 years old, Jesse. Jr.. had been an unusually bright adolescent (A few years later, he would be offered an academic scholarship in physics to M.I.T., though he elected instead a medical career.) His hobby was build- ing balsa model planes, so the balsa material and its physical properties were very familiar to him. In re- cent years. Dr. Marcel has stated unequivocally that what he held in his hands that night was \"definitely not balsa wood.\" And in later family discussions of the I-- beam and symbols, both he and his parents all agreed with the description of what they had seen. The first step in reproducing the I-beam was for me to draw an accurate cross-section of the I-beam. I did, and Dr. Marcel approved it. Kent Jeffrey then presented the drawing to a machine shop in Georgia and requested that four I-beams be milled from aluminum bar stock. In the meantime. Dr. Marcel had faxed me 10 rough sketches based on his recollections of the hieroglyphics- type configurations displayed on the I-beam. I cleaned them up and then created enough similar characters to fill in the remaining length of the I-beam. Dr. Marcel's MARCH 1995 l-beuin sho\\\\n \\\\iih simulated debns.

I faxed a copy of the fi- nal characters to Dr. Marcel for his approval. Not only did he approve, but also his mother endorsed the ap- pearance of the symbols. The final consideration was color. I asked Dr. Marcel to visit a local printing com- pany to select a color that, in his memory, most closely matched that of the symbols. From the printer, he ob- tained a color number from the Pantone Matching System, PMS color 264. The obscure violet descrip- tion familiar to those who have studied Roswell was at last an actual, identifiable color. Finally, color copies of my original black-and-white art were reproduced with adhesive backing and applied individually to the inner surface of one side of each I- beam (shipped to me by the fabricator in mid-January). The task was tedious but well worth the effort. In seeing the replica for the first time, Dr. Marcel said it gave him goose bumps and took him \"back to 1947 when I held the original in my hands.\" He gave the finished piece an enthusiastic \"thumbs up\" approval. While plastic versions of the I-beam may eventually be produced, only four aluminum replicas now exist. One I-beam has been donated to the International UFO Museum and Research Center in Roswell and will soon be on permanent display. Dr. Marcel is the recipient of the second, for without his cooperation, this project would never have happened. Kent Jeffrey will retain possession of the third replica and make it available for use on TV. (It will be shown on an upcoming seg- ment of the \"Sightings\" television program and will also be on display at the July International MUFON Conference in Seattle.)

NEWS FROM MUFON-CES Illobrand von Ludwiger, MUFON National Director for Germany and coordinator for the Mutual UFO Network-Central European Section, provided an update on UFO activities and events in Germany in a recent let- ter. On October 24, 1994, the largest TV station in Germany (ARD), transmitted their first UFO program during prime time, based upon material from Illobrand von Ludwiger's book State of UFO Research (fourth edi- tion in June 1994). Highlights of the program in addition to Illobrand were Dr. Meessen who reported on the UFO wave in Belgium during the 1989-1992 period; an animation on the famous flight of the triangular UFO in Belgium on 11/11/89, produced by R.D. Klein; UFO sightings of a noted German Lufthansa pilot and that of Swissair pilot; prototypes of new unmanned aerial ve- hicles as well as a recently developed German engine for vertical launchings. Three physicists from the Max Planck Institutes for extraterrestrial physics gave positive statements about the general need for a serious investi- gation of the UFO phenomena. Twenty-five percent of all German TV viewers or 8 million people saw the pro- gram, making it the largest number of viewers for a prime time TV program on ARD. Three days after the above program was transmitted, ARD night programming was revised, due to public in- terest, to a show about the reality of UFOs. Illobrand von Ludwiger was one of the four physicists who ap- peared in a moderated panel discussion. One and one-half million viewers watched this program. Viewers later said that Illobrand was far more convincing than Ranga Yogeshwar, the skeptic from another TV station. The ARD is planning a second TV documentary in coopera- tion with MUFON-CES about the inhabitants of UFOs which was scheduled for showing in February 1995. A pay TV movie UFO documentary (60 minutes) has been pro- duced, titled \"UFOs - Looking for Traces by Scientists\" which documents the work of MUFON-CES members. MUFON-CES conducted their annual symposium in October 1994 in Mannheim, Germany. Speakers on the agenda were Prof. Dr. \"Ferrera\" (mathematician and physicist): \"What is Science?\"; Illobrand von Ludwiger, M.S. (physicist): \"20 Years MUFON-CES\"; R. D. Klein, M.S. (physicist): \"New Analyses of UFO Photos and Movies\"; R. \"Haas\" (military flight controller): \"UFO Sightings on Radar Over Central Europe\"; Dr. Lammers (physicist): \"The Face on Mars and the -Impossibility of an Evolution of Life on Mars\"; Dr. Abrahamsohn (sumerol- ogist): \"Errors in the World View and in Interpretations of Sumerological Texts made by Zacharia Zitchin\"; Prof. Dr. Runckel (mathematician): \"Experiences on my Trip to Area 51\"; H. Schmidt-Bredow (journalist): \"Have Fairy Tales and UFO Abduction Stories the same Origin?\"; and Illobrand von Ludwiger: \"New UFO Sightings over Germany.\" PAGE 14 NUMBER 323 MARCH 1995"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL UFO INFORMANT DIES by T. Scott Grain, Jr. O ne of the tew government scientists who may have been privy to how the government handled alleged crashed UFOs in the early l^Os. died of a heart ailment on Friday. February 17. 1995. Dr. Eric A. Walker, who served as President of Penn State University from 1956 to 1970. was instrumental in transforming an obscure public college into one of the nation's premier research universities. Although Walker would talk openly on a wide range of topics, one area that became completely off limits was the UFO subject. In the early 1950s, Dr. Walker served as Executive Secretary of the military's Research and Development Board. Another member serving at the same time was American physicist Dr. Robert Sarbacher. who claims the Board held secret meetings at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base to discuss crashed saucers and their occu- pants. According to Sarbacher, US laboratories ana- lyzed this UFO hardware. He said that the bodies re- covered resembled insects observed on earth. Although Sarbacher did not personally attend these meetings, he claims the one person who attended all of them was Dr. Eric Walker. Dr. Walker was allegedly confronted with these alle- gations on August 30, 1987. by researcher William Steinman from California. According to Steinman, Walker admitted attending these meetings, still had in his possession notes pertaining to these meetings, was not particularly excited that spacecraft and aliens have vis- ited from another world, and told Steinman he was delving into an area that he could do absolutely nothing about. He allegedly admitted he knew of the existence of a group known as MJ-12. Canadian Researcher Grant Cameron and I pursued Walker for additional information from 1987 to 1991, and put our findings in the book, UFOs. MJ-12 & the Government, published by MUFON in 1991. (113 pages, $19.00 plus $1.50 p/h.) The book created quite a stir at the University, where many interested parties called to purchase copies. To insure accuracy before publishing, we sent out a preliminary copy of our report to several interested in- vestigators, one of whom was researcher Bill Moore of California. Moore indicated someone with govern- ment credentials would contact Walker to get to the bottom of this. Apparently, the person chosen for the task was Dr. Christopher Green. According to a June. 1992 article, \"Bluejay.\" by researcher Armen Victorian of England, Green is a founding member of a UFO working group in the Defense Intelligence Agency, a former Scientific Advisor on the Advisory Board to the Directorate of Intelligence, CIA, and is currently head of the Biomedical Science Department in General Motors Research Labs. Several sources, including a CIA officer working in the office of the Deputy Director of Intelligence, informed Victorian that a meeting took place between Walker and Green. When the subject of UFOs was brought up to Walker, apparently the meeting deteriorated. In a phone conversation on May 26, 1992, Green called Victorian and Victorian asked him about the meeting with Walker. \"I'm not prepared to talk about Walker,\" was his response. According to Victorian, Green was practically thrown out of Walker's office. Several years ago, a series of articles about Walker appeared in State College: The Magazine. I met with the author of the series, and filled him in on Dr. Walker's in- volvement in UFO research. During one of the last in- terviews with Walker, he asked if they could have a follow-up discussion about UFOs. Walker initially agreed, but on the day before the interview, declined, stating that he had changed his mind. At various times over the past few years I have writ- ten Walker, asking at this point in time, would he be willing to talk about his involvement in government UFO research. Walker never answered any of my letters after our book was published. It's hard to say how many people called or wrote Walker upon publication of our report. In light of the fact we made some serious allega- tions about Dr. Walker's UFO involvement as a gov- ernment employee, (not only in our book, but on University Public TV and a local CBS affiliate), one would think that a man of his reputation, would want to set the record straight, and quench any rumors about what was true or not true. To my knowledge, Walker had no public comment about what we reported. Walker discussed informants and unnamed sources in one of his newspaper columns for the Centre Daily Times on January 23, 1973. He wrote: \"I cherish the right to know. But I also cherish the right to know who makes false allegations and the right to defend myself against untruths. \"I cannot believe that any class of individuals, news- paper men or scholars, has any special rights to destroy with immunity. Sometime, somewhere, we all have to stand up and prove our alleged facts are indeed facts. That is what it is all about.\" Walker received numerous letters and phone calls from us and others about Sarbacher's allegations. He never said it was not true. He refused the right to defend himself, and we named sources. An effort will be made to examine the alleged notebooks Steinman claims Walker said he had about those 1950 meetings. If we get any definitive answers, we will report our findings. MARCH 1995 NUMBER 323 PAGE 1 5"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL UFO YEAR IN REVIEW: 1994 The 47th year of the modern UFO era was marked by the first official UFO-related report from the U.S. Government in 25 years, and by the continuation of al- most 50 years of sightings. The level of scientific inter- est and activity continues to rise. SIGHTINGS The majority of current reports of alleged UFOs de- scribe odd lights in the night sky, which are exceedingly difficult to investigate because they contain so little in- formation. But an increasing number of reports in 1994 were of distinct objects, rather than just lights. Many of these objects were said to be triangular in shape and able to fly silently at unusually low speed (under 50 mph) and then quickly accelerate to very high speed. In March, there was a rash of reports from south- western Michigan, triggered by the tracking of several unexplained targets by U.S. Weather Service radar and by visual sightings. For several nights, reports poured in to newspapers, radio and TV stations, airports, etc., from average and from skilled observers. No explana- tions were forthcoming. GOVERNMENT ACTIVITY In January, following his inability to get a satisfactory explanation for the July, 1947, UFO? crash in New Mexico from the Secretary of Defense, Rep. Steve Schiff (R-NM) formally asked the General Accounting Office to investigate. The GAO then set out to search for government documents related to this incident, which was highly publicized at the time. No date has been set for the GAO's report to Rep. Schiff, but the GAO has said it will turn over everything it finds to Rep. Schiff. And he has slated that everything he learns will be made public. In September, the U.S. Air Force announced the re- sults of its effort, in support of the GAO, to find docu- mentary evidence of the so-called \"Roswell incident.\" Rather than turn over its information to the GAO, it chose to make it public, announcing that it had \"dis- covered\" that what had been recovered in New Mexico was the remains of a then-cluster of balloons launched as part of tests for the then-secret Project Mogul. Enthusiasm for this \"explanation\" was hinted at almost two years before, by two former Project Mogul em- ployees, as the project had been declassified many years earlier. In response to the USAF report, the Fund for UFO Research pointed out that the remains of synthetic rub- ber balloons known to have been used by Project Mogul in early July, 1947, bore no resemblance to the materials described by first-hand witnesses to the Roswell crash. Moreover, the USAF report states that such balloon materials disintegrate in a few days. This would have left nothing that, witnesses would have noticed, let alone found mysterious, aside from easily-identified pieces of flimsy radar reflectors. ABDUCTIONS Despite the truly bizarre nature of these claims of highly unwelcome interference in personal lives by presumed aliens, reports of such activity continue to stream in. They contain striking patterns and similarities, as well as specific items of description that have been kept out of publication so they can be used as internal checks. It ap- pears that thousands of apparently innocent individuals in all parts of the world are involved in the same strange experiences, which mental health professionals have been unable to explain. Publication is expected early in 1995 of the proceed- ings of a scientific conference on abductions held at (but not by) the Massachusetts institute of Technology. This 600-page plus report will be distributed to univer- sity libraries, medical schools and other facilities where they can be studied by interested professionals. Any member of the press wishing a copy should contact the Fund for UFO Research, Inc. In addition, a computer database of abduction cases is nearing the stage where it will be made available to qualified professionals who wish to study a large body of information in their efforts to understand this peculiar phenomenon. SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH The funding available for serious scientific research into the UFO mystery has increased considerably, thanks to the support of the Bigelow Foundation of Las Vegas, Nevada. Advising the Foundation are representatives of the three major private UFO organizations: the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies, Chicago, IL; the Mutual UFO Network, Seguin, TX, and the Fund for UFO Research. Research proposals are being invited, and the results of research will be published. PERIPHERAL MATTERS Crop Formations. For many years, scores and even hun- dreds of precise, complex formations have appeared in fields of grain, mainly in the southwest of England. There is little basis for assuming any direct connection to UFOs, though this is one of many explanations being considered. Some and possibly many or even all of these formations could well be hoaxes, as the ability to hoax formations and fool so-called experts has been demonstrated. Yet despite the drop in press attention being paid them, the formations continued to appear in England and North America in 1994. Cattle Mutilations. Reports of allegedly high-tech mu- tilations of cows, horses and 1 other farm animals have continued to come in. While these, too, are only specu- latively connected to UFOs, the possibility exists.

It looks like you can find almost anything, although driving the highway is still pretty dif- ficult for many. The information reported about the commercial online services was, unfortunately, several years out of date. I'd like to correct the impression that there isn't much happening in the way of UFOs in the services CompuServe and America OnLine. These services, for my wife Sara and I, are ideal because we get local ac- cess, real-time communications, ease of use. low rates (in the US), graphical interfaces, and a tight-knit world- wide community that generally supplies anything we need in the way of human interactions. We are the section leaders of UFO Theories on CompuServe's New Age Forum. The forum has been around for over three years now, with more than 50,000 members. It has grown enough that it is scheduled to double into an A and B section on March 1st. We have Whitley Strieber in his own Communion Section, as well as Richard Bach and Jach Purcel. Sara and I have hosted online conferences in New Age Forum with several UFO investigators and will next have as guest Marc Davenport. His wife Leah Haley was on CompuServe's Stein OnLine electronic talk show two weeks ago. Also, MUFON is represented by Michael Curta on the Encounters Forum, which has many UFO threads and, along with the New Age Forum, posts electronic issues of the Swamp Gas Journal and The Desert Rat. A year ago we found the Extraterres- trials section in the Space Forum, but like the notorious Issues section mentioned in the article, there's no pro- tection from ridicule and abuse from anyone who feels like flaming. The New Age Forum was founded on the principle that it should be a place for experiencers and thinkers to get away from the skeptics and debunkers, and it really is like a second home to us now. A new forum opened on AOL in December, called The Institute for the Study of Contact with Non-human Intelligences, founded by Michael Lindemann and joined by Karla Turner, Linda Howe, John Carpenter. Dan Drasin, and later on by Stanton Friedman and oth- ers. It is set up as an electronic school. To go there, use the keyword EUN (for Electronic University Network), then click the button Continuing Education, then folder ISCN1; it's listed first. The main drawback is that it has yearly fees and campus passes that keep parts of the forum private un- less you pay the tuitions. However, there is some bene- fit to having an area for low-profile studies, given the na- ture of the material. They have rapidly become very popular, with the public area hosting several wild con- ferences, an \"electronic cafe\" and a sprinkling of li- brary files. UFO: Theories, Case Studies, and Communion are the areas on CompuServe's New Age Forum we hang out in, but on March 1st there will be some new discussion sections for UFOs, New Physics and other related topics.

Among the invitation-only experts presenting papers or reports were 12 abductees. one anthropologist, three author/investigators, three ex- perts in related fields (NDE, Old Hag and ritual abuse), two experts in scientific analysis (dermatopathology and neuroradiology), one folklorist, one historian, 12 in- vestigators, three media representatives, five MDs: one neuropsychologist, 11 Ph.D. psychologists, one philoso- pher, three physicists, two religious studies/ministers, four social workers and three sociologists. Such a book should come with a warning label:. Compelling Contents May Be Inimical To Your Present Career. Indeed, it's hard to work one's way through what is essentially a vast research tool without wanting to make a personal contribution to this challenging and pro- foundly important work. It is noted, however, that the con- ference's use of its facilities was not to be taken as an en- dorsement of the legitimacy of alien abduction research by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but as an af- firmation of the principles of freedom of academic re- search and expression. Dr. Mack and his co-sponsor, M.I.T. physicist David E. Pritchard, concurred in their opening remarks that one should expect to discover few answers, but that one would also encounter \"science in ac- tion . . . therapeutic techniques that help [the abductees] and promising [new] research directions.\" The submitted papers are short and punchy; graphics, illustrations and drawings abound. Lively discussions cap most papers and reports. The Chapter headings pro- vide the sweep of areas covered. They are: The Abduction Experience, Evidence, Psychology of Abductees, Hypotheses, Ethics, Therapy and Investigation, and What Should We Consider Next? The diversity of the presenters and their hypotheses (most were amenable to falsifi- cation testing) did however at rare times go from the ridiculous to the sublime, But this is to the credit of the conference and the book, as an embodiment of Gestalt theory, where the whole is more than the sum of its parts. Of greatest interest to this reader were research find- ings which strongly imply a literal interpretation of the abduction phenomena. A particular example is Dr. John G. Miller's paper, \"Medical Procedural Differences: Alien vs. Human,\" which compares alleged alien doctors' practices with those of their human counterparts. Whereas the aliens assert \"we have the right to do this,\" human doctors try to explain; alien doctors perform mind scans, human doctors ask questions; alien doctors directly probe nasal passages with sharp objects, human doctors use a speculum to open the nostril first, etc. Dr. Miller concludes that \"the differences between reported alien and known human medical techniques and proce- dures are great enough to invalidate any theory that these reports somehow originate in the witnesses' own medical experience or knowledge.\" Another such example was provided by Deborah Bruce Truncale. M. Divinity, Ph.D. Psychology, from her paper, \"Alien/UFO Experiences of Children.\" Her \"experience \"observing children making up and telling a story [is] that they generally take their time, engage in eye contact or stop to check out the lis- tener's reaction. When observing children relate abduc- tion/alien encounters they are generally more animated and speak quickly, recalling an account without the be- havior that accompanies making up or story telling.\" To the researchers, however, there will likely be infinitely more potential pay dirt in work being done by Dan Wright, Manager of MUFON's Abduction Transcription Project. What was envisioned (now deep in process) is a computer-accessible \"database containing the verbatim hypnosis transcripts (hundreds) from the cases on audio tape that you (the researchers) consider credible.\" Noted UFO skeptic Robert Sheaffer presented \"A Skeptical Perspective on UFO Abductions.\" He sarcas- tically puts down the varied appearances of alien proto- types seen in different countries as meaning that the \"Galactic High Command must have divided earth into Alien Occupation Zones.\" Then there's the paper by Paul Horowitz, Ph.D. Physics, entitled \"Radio Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.\" He argues that extraordi- nary energy expenditures and cost constraints would have E. T. phone home rather than ride around the uni- verse in a spaceship. Of course he's missed the historic fact that science generally advances by doing things differently and in unexpected ways. For a universe that may be infinitely old and teeming with intelligent life, who can guess what the science and technology of a very ancient society might, or might not, consist of?

Will you join us March 29th Wednesday Noon in Washington, D.C. for a demonstration at the General Accounting Office? This demonstration is not a protest. Its purpose is to support New Mexico Congressman Steven SchifTs ef- fort to gain information on Roswell. Schiff's initiative in bringing the GAO into the inquiry is extremely impor- tant and has already produced results. Due to the GAO's involvement, the U.S. military last September issued its first public statement on UFOs in 25 years. We are the March 29th Comittee of Operation Right to Know, and we believe public political action is nec- essary to end the UFO cover-up. All of us in the UFO community have special knowledge. We know there is a joker in the deck of cards America is playing with, and sooner or later that joker will be dealt. Knowledge of the reality and the extraterrestrial nature of UFOs cannot be contained indefinitely. Can we continue to passively sit and wait when we know an upheaval of major propor- tions lies in our future? Do you remember when ORTK started 3 years ago? Some in ufology said demonstrations would be a mis- take and would bring ridicule upon the UFO community. Since that time ORTK has held eight demonstrations, and other groups have held three. Have You noticed any increase in ridicule directed at the UFO community? We haven't. Instead, we find that standing up in public and at- testing to the reality of UFOs is a personally liberating experience, and we invite you to share that with us March 29th. The demonstration site is 441 G Street at 4th NW. This is a legal event and a permit has been issued by GAO. There will be a picket line with signs carried and chanting, and we will fly a 35-ft replica of a 1947 mili- tary balloon to show what did not crash at Roswell. Info 202-232-2410 or ORTK@aol.com. Will you join us? â€” The March 29th Committee of ORTK: Elaine Douglass, Matthew Dyke, Stan Hendler, Len Kasten, Leo Pagavoya, Mark Smith, and John Stanton Mogul Balloon Update Last summer, in your review of Karl Pflock's Roswell in Perspective, you said the only way to refute it would be to resort to character assassination. That prediction was wrong. Project Mogul Flight No. 9, mentioned as the culprit in scattering debris on the Brazel ranch, has been eliminated. Although the winds aloft data suggested that it would have followed the path of Flight No. 8 and Flight No. 10, it wasn't as definitive as it could have been. Now the final proof has surfaced. We know that Flight No. 8 was designed to be launched in conjunction with a V-2 launch originally scheduled for the morning of July 3, but postponed. Flight No. 8 was launched about 5:30 in the morning. Flight No. 9 was scheduled to be launched with the rescheduled rocket flight at 7:30 that evening. There was an accident on the pad and the rocket didn't fly. Flight No. 9 was then scrubbed, and the equipment pulled from it. The balloons, made of neoprene had been inflated and it was impossible to put the Helium back into the bottles. Because the Helium would leak, the balloons were released. The designation had been Flight No. 9, the tags had been used, so that designation was not reused. Flight No. 9, then, was made of neo- prene balloons with NO array train. In other words, there was nothing on Flight No. 9 that would have scat- tered any sort of metallic-looking debris. There were no rawin targets, no sonobuoys, nothing other than neo- prene. Photographs have been located showing the neo- prene balloons but no array train. The Air Force suggested it was Flight No. 4, but it seems that No. 4 suffered from the same problem. Currently, the best evidence is that Flight No. 4 was launched with a sonobuoy but no long array train. As we develop the final information, it will be clear that Project Mogul balloons cannot account for the de- bris. It will be just one more failed explanation. â€” Kevin Randle Marion, IA No, I did not say that the only way to refute Pflock 's re- port would be to resort to character assassination. Here's what I wrote at the time (July, 1994, p. J7): \"In fact, Pflock's overall case for Project Mogul is so per- suasive that one can only wonder how critics will re- spond. My own prediction is that a number of attempts will be made to shoot the messenger, rather than the message . . . [that] given the paranoid tendencies of many within ufology, he is almost bound to be labeled a CIA 'spy' or some other form of government 'disinfor- mation ' agent. \" And that has indeed been the case. As you are almost certainly aware, a number of individuals within the UFO community have bruited darkly (and publicly) about Pflock's past, rather than addressing the actual issues as you have here. My statement was not meant to imply that any new information arising out of or about Roswell (or Project Mogul) should be con- strued as character assassination and nothing but, nor was it an attempt to preempt any valid criticisms that might be forthcoming. The Journal is happy to be ap- prised of any recent developments, and I presume Mr. Pflock is, too. That said, the Mogul issue is but one of several raised by Roswell in Perspective. MARCH 1995 NUMBER 323 PAGE 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL ELECTRICAL HYPERSENS1TIV1TY I hope Journal readers will consider the assertions in Albert Budden's \"Aliens, Electricity and Allergies\" (Feb. 1995) with healthy skepticism. Budden follows such as the Air Force, Menzel, Klass, Persinger, etc., in trying to explain the entire gamut of reported UFO ex- periences by a single, \"scientifically respectable,\" i.e., mundane, paradigm. Over the years we've had swamp gas, atmospheric temperature inversions, plasmas, geo- piezoelectric fields; now we're offered Electrical Hypersensitivity (EH) allergy of the human brain to presumed electrical/magnetic hot spots. This could be an intriguing concept for explaining some reported UFO experiences, but Budden's article fails to adequately substantiate its validity. His references to the existence of EH allergy are mainly to his own ear- lier writing, which may â€” like this article â€” just arbi- trarily assert that EH allergy exists for some individuals. Budden makes his entire case here on his reading of Whitley Strieber (whose name is misspelled throughout the article) as proof of EH victimhood. I submit that sup- porting a proposed hypothesis with the ruminations of one so ambivalent in his own introspective ramblings as Strieber is not suitably convincing. Doubly so, when the premise is based on Budden's arbitrary assumptions. He admits \"I have not interviewed Whitley Strieber to ask him pertinent questions,\" yet he's confident â€” for instance â€” that Strieber's secluded cabin is \"almost certainly in a hot spot location.\" An interesting specu- lation sadly lacking in verification. Other questionable assertions by Budden include at- tribution of the mysterious movement of Strieber's doors to a magnetic field, claiming that a dielectric (insulator) material such as a wooden door will move against such a field! In truth, a dielectric material is not repulsed (or attracted) by a magnetic field, although if electrically charged it could respond to an electrostaft'c field. (Too, an oscillating electromagnetic field may induce heating in a dielectric material, a la the microwave oven â€” but not motion.) With regard to intersecting microwave beams from communication/military transmitters, the field concen- tration is not mysteriously \"doubled or tripled.\" The energy present in the intersection is the interactive sum of the individual energies in the beams at that point; there is no source of additional energy. Another dubious assertion: \"Researchers arranging for abductees to have CAT scans ... have concluded that the [nasal] 'probe' is detectable as a magnetic reso- nance ...\" Since a CAT scan uses X-rays, I doubt its value for revealing magnetic anomalies. To be charita- ble, perhaps Budden means an MRI scan, which uses a technique of magnetic resonance imaging: I can't speak for Strieber, but I can relate my own \"major electrical event in [my] formative years,\" which has not \"primed [my] bodily system for EH allergies in later life\": at age seven, I suffered a severe electric shock from a defective appliance. While it left me with a psychotic fear of electrical outlets for a number of years, it didn't trigger an EH allergy. Neither did a po- tentially lethal shock through the head as a young adult, nor did lightning striking within 20 feet of me on two occasions in my life. Neither have 25+ years of working in full-power AM, FM and TV transmitter sites, nor has residing since 1966 near TV and AM broadcast towers whose strong signals intrude annoyingly into my home audio, radio and TV devices. Of course this doesn't disprove Budden's hypothesis; perhaps I'm just not susceptible to EH allergy. We do know, ever since Delgado's experiments on primates 30 years ago, that direct electrical stimulation of the brain (with implanted electrodes) can produce halluci- natory perceptions and physical reactions. We also know that at least some persons hear \"sounds\" when their heads are irradiated with some mi- crowave energies. But most of us are unaware of any de- finitive research revealing intricately detailed halluci- natory perceptions attributable to external fields when there are no implanted or attached electrodes., If same exists, Budden should give us explicit examples. Such research could be rewarding; it might offer a valid explanation for some \"UFO\" experiences. Since Budden's hypothesis rests for the most part on largely known, repeatably measurable physical stimuli â€” mag- netic, electrical and electromagnetic fields â€” research should be relatively easy. Even if in fact Strieber's re- mote cabin does lie in a \"hot spot,\" that of itself is in- sufficient. It will be necessary to research dozens or hundreds of alleged abduction locations for hot spot activity to seek any statistical correlation. Approaching from another angle, Budden might interview hundreds of individuals who have spent lifetimes working in power plants, radar installations, radio, TV and microwave transmission facilities, and in other electromagnetically intensive occupations to determine if there is a signifi- cant incidence of \"hallucination experiences\" among them (I'm not aware of even one among my many co- workers over the years). Should such research confirm Budden's hypothesis, it may solve some of the puz- zling aspects of the abduction scenario. It also will open the door to manipulation of human perception and behavior through \"mind-control\" tech- nology â€” which some doomsayers insist already exists and is in covert use. Let's hope Budden and the doom- sayers are wrong. â€” Robert H.

Webb April 1995 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Mars, near the Cancer-Leo border, continues to fadeâ€”from magnitude -0.2 to 0.5 during the month. Having ended retro- grade motion March 25, the reddish planet now is moving eastward again against the stars. Earth's rotation, however, carries it westward during the night. At dusk Mars can be found high in the S. Jupiter (magnitude -2.4), in Ophiuchus, rises in the ESE about 11:30 PM daylight time in mid-April. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): As the month progresses, look low in the E at dawn as daz- zling Venus (-3.9) approaches much fainter Saturn (1.2) from the upper right. The two planets are closest, only half a degree apart, on the 13th. The crescent Moon joins the pair from April 25 to 27. Mars sets in the NW about 3:45 AM in mid- month. Jupiter is low in the SSW at dawn. Two Eclipses: On the morning of April 15 observers in the western states. Alaska, and Hawaii have a chance to see a rather small partial eclipse of the Moon. At 4:41 AM (PDT) the upper edge of our satellite grazes the Earth's dark umbral shadow. A maxi- mum of only 12% of the Moon's diameter is covered at 5:18. Umbral eclipse is over at 5:55. Farther to the E the Moon sets during the eclipse. Two weeks later on the 29th Florida (most of the state) be- comes the only spot in the U.S. to witness another small eclipse, but this time the Moon hides a piece of the Sun. At Miami the partial solar eclipse begins at 1:14 PM. covers a similar 12% of the Sun's diameter at 2:10. and ends at 2:59. As in all solar eclipses, do not look directly at the Sun! Instead, project the Sun's image through a pinhole in a card (or through a telescope or binocular eyepiece) onto a white surface. Meteor Shower: A quarter Moon interferes during the Lyrid meteors peak morning hours on April 22 and 23. However, moonless skies will prevail in the evening so that a few Lyrids should be seen then. The bright white meteors streak out of little Lyra the Harp in the NE. Moon Phases: First quarterâ€”April 8 C Full moonâ€”April 15 Last quarterâ€”April 21 o New moonâ€”April 29 The Stars: Leo the Lion lies due S in mid-April at 10 PM daylight time. This reclining king of beasts leads the procession of spring- time constellations in the E. To find some of the prominent seasonal patterns, use the Big Dipper's pointer system. (The Big Dipper rides high in the N.) A line through the two stars on the end of the dipper's bowl can be extended one way to Polaris the North Star and the other way to Leo. If the curve of the dipper's handle is fol- â€¢ lowed, the arc takes you first to the orange star Arcturus in Bootes the Herdsman and then onward to bluish-white Spica in Virgo the Maiden.

NEW FIELD INVESTIGATOR'S MANUAL The much awaited fourth edition of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual was available for shipment on March 1, 1995. It is nearly a complete revision, with an entirely new format, compared to the third edition which had been accepted as the standard manual in the English-speaking nations. It is composed of 24 sec- tions, some having several part numbers, and authored by a vast contingent of outstanding UFO researchers and investigators. The 311 page manual is being delivered in a 3-ring loose leaf hardback notebook. Edited by Walter H. Andrus, Jr., the manual is re- spectfully dedicated to Jerold R. \"Ron\" Johnson and Dan C. Overlade, Ph.D., for not only their personal contributions to the manual, but their individual dedi- cation to resolving the UFO phenomenon. Many of you purchased the MUFON Field Investigator's Training Guide authored by T. David Spencer, Deputy Director of Investigations, which is an outstanding adjunct to the new manual for instructors as well as students. Due to the manual's size and weight, special mailing envelopes were purchased for shipping. The price to MUFON members has been set at $25 plus $3.50 for postage and handling, whereas non-current members may obtain the new manual for $35 plus $3.50 for p. and h. The same price will apply in foreign countries. May I personally thank everyone for their patience while the new manual was being produced, since it did create a hardship and handicap in conducting field in- vestigator training classes. A grateful thanks is also ex- tended to all of the authors who wrote specific sections for the manual. This was an accomplishment that no one person could fulfill, since each section was written by an authority in the particular field involved. I am confident that the waiting was justified. The fourth edition of the manual is truly a state-of-the-art production which will make everyone very proud. RESEARCH PROPOSALS The Mutual UFO Network has joined with the Center for UFO Studies and the Fund for UFO Research in a coalition that will solicit for research proposals. The members of the coalition council will pass judgment on the proposals submitted and then fund worthy projects with monetary grants. The objective of all three groups is to move the study of UFOs more toward science us- ing the general protocols of the scientific method.

MUFONET BULLETIN BOARD NETWORK As a follow-up on the featured article in the February 1995 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal titled \"UFO Resources in Cyberspace,\" Pete Theer, the MUFONET BBS Network Administrator, is sharing more specific in- formation for our aficionado computer communication members. Mr. Theer regularly locates, reviews, and ba- sically scans written documents, newspaper and UFO newsletter articles; edits them to fit the message system; and posts them on the network for the information and benefit of all MUFON members free of charge. MUFONet Network BBS Systems must provide access to MUFON members free of charge as a requirement of joining the Network. None of our 130 plus systems worldwide charges for access to the MUFON areas. As of this date we have MUFONet Member BBS Systems in the following countries: U.S.A., Puerto Rico, Canada, Australia, England, Wales, Scotland, Germany, Austria, Luxemburg and Brazil. The BBS Network has message areas set up for discussions of specific topics: MUFON Member area for MUFON members only; MU- FON Public area where MUFON members can converse with nonmembers worldwide, Abduction/Alien Contact Discussions; MUFON News Items; Operation Right to Know forum established in cooperation with Operation Right to Know; an area for the discussion of paranormal topics; dream interpretation; extraterrestrial hypothesis discussions; conspiracies and coverups; and more. Pete advises that we have just established a working relationship with the FOX Network \"Encounters\" TV show staff and have a MUFON forum established under the \"Encounters\" forum on CompuServe, the nation's largest time-sharing computer network. Michael Curta, Colorado State Director was instrumental in establishing this link and is currently acting as moderator of this area. In the near future, Mr. Theer will be starting a message area specifically for the training of Field Investigators. The MUFONet BBS Data Line number is (512) 556- 2524. If members have any questions or would like to discuss any of the above, they may contact Pete at work (817) 628-4335 or at home on (512) 556-2746.
