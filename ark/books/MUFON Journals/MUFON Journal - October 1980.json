FROM THE EDITOR We include in this issue Ilkka Serra's workshop paper from the 1980 Houston MUFON Symposium discussing UFO research in Scandinavia. V.-J. Ballester, Olmos contributes a valuable international bibliography of source materials. The Smithsonian Institution UFO symposium September 6 raised some expectations that UFOs might be reaching a new plateau of respectability and scientific attention. Although public interest was surprisingly high, it is doubtful that the attitudes, of scientists and officials were much influenced. News media coverage was mediocre; without adequate news coverage, and without a stronger focus on why UFOs deserve more serious attention, the symposium is not likely to have much effect on the present impasse.

A large crowd (400-500) filled the Baird Auditorium of the Natural History Museum, even at the mind-boggling price of $30 admission ($25 for Smithsonian Associates). Flash bulbs popped continously. Moderator Frederick C. Durant III, recently retired as a special assistant to the Director of the National Air & Space Museum, ruled with an iron hand and made the speakers stick to the tight schedule. In one corner were what Phil Klass called the \"UFO promoters\": Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Dr. Bruce S. Maccabee, and Allan Hendry. In the other corner were what Maccabee, in his retort, called the \"UFO demoters\": Phillip Klass, Robert Scheaffer, and James Oberg. The results were fairly predictable; the \"promoters\" promoted and the \"demoters\" demoted. Dr. Hynek probably summed it up best in a comment at the University of Maryland the night before: \"I don't know of a single scientific problem that was ever solved by debate, only by hard work.\" He added, however, that a debate in such a prestigious forum could help to stir up the interest that would allow the hard work to be done. Both sides were effective in what they set out to do. Drawing on examples from the history of science, Hynek'cautioned that the very puzzling nature of UFOs may be a signal that something important is going on. Maccabee expressed \"skepticism of the skeptics,\" illustrating cases where they have been in error, and both men discussed strong cases as examples. Hendry, using slides, showed examples of all the important case types. He also clashed strongly with Klass over some particulars of cases, providing the only real fireworks of the day. Klass acknowledged that UFOs could not be anyone's secret weapons, but also said they could not be spaceships since the U.S. radar network is all-encompassing and they would not go undetected. Nor could the U.S. government keep a secret for over 30 years. He also said there were too many UFO reports for spaceships to be a credible answer, a statement disputed by Scheaffer when his turn came to speak. \"One UFO moving from place to place could cause many sightings,\" he noted. Scheaffer then proceeded to give the most irrelevant talk of the day, linking UFObgists with people who study fairies, witchcraft, astrology, and a long list of other borderline sciences or pseudosciences. \"Which do you throw out,\" he asked, \"UFOs or physics?\" Oberg, while agreeing with Klass and Scheaffer that UFO reports have not been proven to be something new and important, left the door open a crack. He believes that UFO reports do deserve scientific attention for reasons of serendipity, if nothing else, and that if they are something real, they would clearly be of great import. But research suffers both from \"shotgun skepticism\" and blatant exploitation (citing the National Enquirer as a prime example), not to mention unsophisticated investigators. He does not think that UFOs are real, but does not rule out that someone could be flying here across space. He is particularly perturbed by false claims of astronaut sightings, some of which he believes are propagated by a small group of low- level russian technologists. The major impression of this observer was that the level of dialogue Smithsonian panel, I. to r., Bruce S. Maccabee, J. Allen Hynek, James Oberg, F.C. Durant, Allan Hendry, Philip Klass, Robert Scheaffer (photo: Thomas P. Oeuleyl"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"(Smithsonian, Continued) has changed little in 30 years, that minds are made up, and that too much time is wasted arguing about \"pop ufology\" rather than about the hardcore cases. Whether or not extraterrestrial beings could reach the earth if they wanted to, or whether they would want to, are totally irrelevant considerations. The honest answer to these questions -- also affirmed by Oberg â€” is that no one knows, and those that pretend to know one way or the other are, in his words, \"blowing smoke.\" The choice of \"throwing out\" either UFOs or physics, posed by Scheaffer, is of the sameorder. If UFOs are unreal, they will change our understanding of human behaviour; if they are real, they will change our understanding of physics. No necessary contradiction between the two has been established. Futhermore, a theory or hypothesis (\"extrater- restrial\"), while obviously important and relevant, should not take precedence over empirical investi- gation. It remains to be seen how much the symposium will \"stir up.\" Due to the visible public interest, the Smithsonian is considering publishing the proceedings. The Christian Science Monitor reported it on September 10. Time magazine had a reporter present and a story was planned (it has not appeared as of this writing). Other area news media, the wire services, and some science magazines covered the event. Depending on what they say, some new dialogue may result. SIX-YEAR UFO STUDY (From the Enterprise-Courier, Charleston, Mo. - Dec. 6, 1979) 34 UFO Sightings in Region Called Incredible' by Physicist Dr Harley Rut ledge has announced part or the results of a ax-year scientific field study of Unidentified Flying Objects he directed while chairing the physcs depart- ment at Southeast Missouri State University in Cape Girardeau During that sn year period the professor sind ho and co workers had exp*n^nced ISJ sightings of l?4 I'Hh He labelled 34 of il* sightings as incredible because the LTOs exhibited physical or behavioral properties beyond known man-made technology Rutledge. director of Project Identification, a University-based organization of scientists, engineers, students. and amateur astronomers formed to study UFOs, said that on 32 oc- casions UFOs seemed to react to him and other Project members \"It's enough to make you think someone Is playing a game with us.\" Covering a large area of Southeast Missouri, the field study has extended 30 miles north of Si Louis, n miles west of the Mississippi Kiver, and into Illinois The Project has lagged 38 sightings of 37 UFOi near Piedmont, where the study began in April. 1973; 17 sightings of 19 UFOs near Farming!on. and 104 sightings of 117 UKOs near the Mississipi River along a 70 mile stretch from Perryville toSikeslon But 48 lightings of 50 UFOs were from within or near the city limits of Cape Girardeau itself. \"Often UFOs have hovered over or near the city.\" Rutledge said. In once case a Cape Girardeau girl reported being chased by a small dec flying at treetop level. It temporarily blinded the girl by flashing a bright light down upon her as she reached the door of her home. Two witnesses vended the experience. Rulledge reports ttjet many of the UFOs were observed in motion and 41 UFOs changed motion by starting, stopping, or changing direction In some cases hovenng lights streaked across the sky in a fraction of a second at low altitude and even under a cloud cover Rutledge has observed a light make an instantaneous right- angle turn, the light switching off 20 seconds later \"If that was an object having mas>, that kind of turn IB im- possible,\" Rutledge em- phasized \"But I've seen a lot of things that looked im- possible \" Of the 174 UFOs observed by Project members, 88 have been mere balls of light. Five were seen to turn on, 47 turn off, while 36 turned on and off. Six different colors-have been observed â€¢ SO off-white. 27 amber. 21 white, 7 red. 5 yellow, and two lights were a green color. Five lights changed color. Seven craft have been ob- served, including two duo and a bullet-shaped object One of the discs wasobserved in daylight by Rutledge from his office at the University The bullet-shaped object, also observed in daylight, changed color and vanished. Contrary to popular representations of UFOs on television and in the movies, only three UFOs observed by Ruiledg* and his crews made sound. Eighteen sightings occurred in daylight and IB more at duik. These 36 sightings constitute nearly one-fourth the Project totals and under conditions where sunlight would have illuminated any crafl in the sky. \"I'm not the only one seeing these things.\" Rutledge pointed out. During the 153 sightings, 622 persons have been present, representing more than 30 Project mem- bers and well over a hundred different persons as spec- tators. That averages about four persons present per sighting. \"How could any UFO study, or single sighting, be better documented than this?\" he asks. Rutledge promises that soon he will release more startling results from Project data to the public. \"In the beginning, we formed this organization to seek the truth and present it to the public.\" Rutledge stated. \"At first I was reticent to describe some of our in- credible experiences for fear of ridicule. We have been careful not to make un- substantiated claims.\" UFO WEEKEND During the weekend of the Smithsonian UFO Symposium, separate programs were sponsored by or jointly operated by the Fund for UFO Research, the Center for UFO Studies, and Citizens Against UFO Secrecy. At a press conference Friday, September 5, members of all three groups joined in a call for the government to turn over military reports to civilian groups after proper security screening and to allow former government employees to talk about their sightings. On Friday evening, Dr. J. Allen Hynek spoke at the University of Maryland; after his talk, a panel discussion included Dr. Bruce S. Maccabee, Stanton Friedman, and Richard Hall. On Saturday evening, the Fund for UFO Research sponsored a program at the American University where the speakers were Stanton Friedman and Capt. William Startup, airline pilot from New Zealand. Capt. Startup described his experiences while flying the plane on the night of December 31, 1978, when the movie films were taken of objects also seen visually and tracked on radar. MUFON was represented by Bruce Maccabee, Maryland State Director, and Richard Hall. D D D D The Committee of skeptics led by philosopher Paul Kurtz, informally known as the \"Committee to Repeal Anomalous Phenomena,\" was well represented at the Smithsonian UFO Symposium. All three skeptics on the panel are associated with the group. Kurtz travelled to Washington at their invitation especially for the occasion."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"SCANDINAVIAN WORKSHOP By Ilkka Serra (MUFON Representative for Finland) (Following are excerpts from Mr. Serra's prepared paper, which included a history of UFO research in Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark.) Believe it or not, but organized UFO research did not begin in Finland until the 1960's. There are two reasons for this. First, the geographical reason. Finland is way up north in the European neck-of-the-woods. It is far away from the European centers of action. And second, the reason related to our national character and the official attitude. The Finnish people are very quiet and introverted by character. What about the official attitude? At first glance it seems to be similar to the intentional silence that has been reported in several countries, but if you dig deeper in the silence you find out that it is not really intentional. It is simply the result of slow bureaucratic action. In fact, there has been no official attitude so far. It has taken a lot of energy to get active UFO research going in Finland. But we have taken this as a challenge and we have succeeded. The first organization was founded in 1960 in the city of Porvoo. It was called the Flying Saucer Club and consisted mostly of active persons from Helsinki. The second organization, the Interplanetarian Society, was founded on November 21, 1962. The first president of the organization was a clergyman, the Reverend Arvi Merikallio, and the center of operation was Helsinki. This organization had a very challenging goal. The Society was founded for the purpose of spreading UFO information to the Finnish people. This was such an important job that we regard this organization as the pioneer of the field, even though it was the second organization and not the first one. These pioneers thought UFOs were most probably spacecraft built by people from outer space, and they thought it was possible that the space people had a message to all of us. The Interplanetarian Society started to grow, and in the fall of 1963 the Society published its first membership magazine. Two years later the Society had as many as 100 members. This may not seem like much, but for a scarely populated country like Finland it is a hell of a lot. The same portion of population here in America would mean as many as 7,300 people. However, there was also one setback. The president, the Reverend Arvi Merikallio, declared it was against his beliefs to continue as a member and he resigned. Other talented forces continued his work. In 1967 the organization began to publish the Vimana magazine. The word Vimana is from the Sanskrit language and it means a flying craft. The magazine was published at a slow pace, four times a year, but it turned out to be extremely efficient in spreading the information. A couple of local branches had also started active operation by now, one in the city of Turku and the other in the city of Oulu. But the following year, 1968, was perhaps the most important year for Finnish UFO research. The backbone of modern UFO research in Finland, Mr. Tapani Kuningas introduced himself to the members by organizing the first scientific study of past sightings. The material he accumulated during the study was also the raw material for his first book, \"UFO's in the Skies of Finland.\" Since then he has published several books. When the first American astronauts landed on the moon in 1969, the Finnish UFO research people presented a request for UFO reports on the nationwide radio network. The request resulted in about 400 letters and the amount of members in the Interplanetarian Society climbed up to 300, which here in America would mean Ilkka Serra approximately 22,000 members. The amount of UFO sightings was also gradually increasing. In 1970 Mr. Tapani Kuningas was chosen president of the Inter- planetarian Society. New requests for UFO reports were published in several UFO books. In 1971 a large UFO wave took place in Finland. And the first commercially operating magazines were founded. The first one, UFO Time (Ufoaika in Finnish), went bankrupt after a few years, but the second, ULTRA magazine began to feature all aspects of the New Age, not only UFO's. At the moment ULTRA magazine is the leading New Age magazine in the Scandinavian countries. Once or twice a year the magazine publishes new requests for UFO reports. However, what goes up must come down. The second half of the 1970's was a downhill ride for the Interplanetarian Society. The Society (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"(Workshop, Continued) was officially dissolved last year (1979). But why did it happen? The major reason was the founding of UFO Research of Finland, which I represent, on April 29, 1973. There were several reasons for this. The country had a couple of dozen local organizations and clubs, but they were not able to cooperate. The members had no guidelines for operation and there was a general need for a more scientific method of research. And since the Interplanetarians had already done the pioneering work it was , time to introduce some new ideas. Mr. Kuningas was chosen chairman of the new organization, and from the very beginning the organization started holding UFO conferences and special education weekends for members. The publication of our quarterly reports was commenced in spring 1974, both in Finnish and in English. In July 1975 we started cooperation with the Swedish U.R.D. Foundation in order to develop computerized sighting reports. The report form was first made in Swedish and later translated into Finnish and English. In the fall of the same year we mailed an informative letter to the President of Finland, Mr. Urho Kekkonen, hoping to gain public recognition for UFO research. In 1975 it was time for a new UFO wave and the amount of sighting reports increased. Now it was time to start a deeper Scandinavian co-operation. In spring 1978. the First Scandinavian UFO Conference was held in Norway. A special program for information exchange between the Scandinavian countries was agreed upon. Last year I was chosen chairman of the UFO Research of Finland. Mr. Tapani Kuningas continued his services as vice-chairman. I could summarize our history by saying the following. UFO Research of Finland receives about 100 sighting reports annually. We mail our quarterly reports to 20 carefully selected addresses around the world. We have applied for grants from several funds, but so far in vain. And at the moment we have almost 100 members, some of them investigators and some support members. We have not been able to gain public recognition or public support, but once again, we take it as a challenge and we believe we can do it in the future. The Greatest Achievements One of the major achievements of UFO Research of Finland was publication of the radar-visual sighting by military pilots on April 12, 1969, at noon. The story goes like this: The pilot's mission was to perform an orientation flight above the Pori airport in western Finland. The weather was sunny and at an altitude of 3 kilometers there was a strong 100 knot wind from the north. Another military officer was sitting beside him in his plane. After receiving instructions from the Rissala air control the pilot guided his plane to the runway. Now he and the other man heard a radio conversation between a Fouga fighter plane and the training officer on the ground. The officer: \"Hey 286, discontinue your mission and go to see what those 7 balloons above you really are â€” over.\" The;plane: \"Roger, discontinued. I'll go and see them.\" The officer: \"They seem to be stationary above the airfield. I guess the altitude would be something like 1500 to 3000 meters. There seem to be 7 of them.\" The plane: \"Roger, I will climb up.\" At this moment the major witness turned his plane on the runway to see the balloons better. He saw 7 yellow balloon-shaped objects hovering above the airfield as if observing something. Now the Fouga fighter plane began to approach the balloons and the radio conversation continued. Air control: \"We can see them here at the air control.\" The radar officer: \"The radar is observing them.\" The training officer: \"286, this is your officer, they seem to move slowly due north, yeah, I think they are gonna leave you, you won't catch them any more. They are disappearing in the northern skies.\" A few seconds later the same objects were observed in Vaasa, which is about 180 kilometers north of Pori. The speed must have been enormous, and they were flying against heavy winds so they could not have been balloons. And it could not have been an hallucination since it was confirmed by radar. The publicity that we have received has contributed to the fact that as many as 40 Finnish-language UFO books have appeared in our book stores. Most of them have been translations from foreign books, but the local writers have also published a number of volumes. UFO Research of Finland has also contributed to the making of the first Finnish-language UFO documentary movie. The one-hour movie was made by Mr. Raimo Miekka and Mr. Oiva Nieminen and it was completed only a few weeks ago. Our greatest achievements in the field of research have been the UFO fragment case from Kallavesi Lake in 1964 and the Suonenjoki metal retrieval case from last year. The fragment case has been published in MUFON UFO Journal and the Suonenjoki case has been introduced in our quarterly report number 3/79. No natural solution has been found for the UFO fragment. It was neither a geological entity nor a meteorite. As far as the Suonenjoki case is concerned, it contains 12 photos of a mini-ufo and four landing trace areas with pieces of metal and some red liquid in them. One member on our board of directors, Mr. Urpo Hayrinen, an engineer, has created a theory about the possible source of UFO energy. UFO energy may be produced by fusion. First you make positrons in a meson field and when the positrons collide with electrons they combine and make gravitons. And graviton energy is UFO energy. If you want to control graviton energy you can do it by using magnetic fields. It sounds simple, but it fits with all the EM effects that have been observed around UFOs. Patent is pending here in the United States. As far as other theories and ideas are concerned, we believe that there are several explanations to UFO phenomena and one of them is most likely parapsychic. There is one interesting aspect in our international contacts. We have managed to create a continuing dialogue with East European investigators. We have contacts with (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"(Workshop, Continued) Yugoslavia, Poland, and Russian Estonia. We have also become experts on Russian rocket launchings that take place at Plesetsk near the Finnish border. We can tell Russian rockets from real UFO phenomena. UFO Research of Finland would like to see a widening of international information exchange. We believe that after each major research project the investigators should publish the results, not only as articles in magazines, but as international information letters mailed directly to similar organizations in other countries. My organization operates according to the principle of direct mail and we hope that other organizations will follow our example. We believe that an international UFO organization should operate within the framework of the United Nations, since independent international organizations are given a consultative status at the U.N. If the new organization would only perform consultative duties, it would not stumble to the differences of opinion in the international UFO research community. In short, we believe that direct mail and a low profile work at the U.N. are the keys to a better future of UFO research. Sweden The pioneering organization in Sweden has been UFO-SVERIGE (UFO SWEDEN). Its members can be congratulated for a couple of great achievements: The team-work solution and the UFO Sweden Support Fund. They have based all work on the activities of local teams. There are at least 3 persons in each team. And the Swedish people can make donations to the UFO Sweden Support Fund. The people of UFO Sweden hope that the joint endeavours within the international UFO movement will lead to a better understanding of the UFO phenomena. In small countries like the Scandinavian countries there is a need for closer contacts, with bigger and stronger organizations in foreign countries. UFO Sweden is looking forward to a widening of international information exchange. The U.R.D. Foundation is the second major UFO organization in Sweden. It is scientifically oriented and it has been in operation for about 4 years. The greatest achievements are as follows: The systematic and statistical research method for finding answers to the questions \"Is there really something?\" and if so \"What is it?\" The computerized sighting report, access to an IBM 370 computer, systematic training scheme supported by a training manual, the idea that there must be a greatest common denominator for all UFO cases, and the beginning of joint Scandinavian investigation efforts based on U.R.D. methods. The U.R.D. Foundation believes that goals must be defined, the work needed to achieve the goals must be specified, resources must be organized, and international cooperation must lead to, harmonization and standardization. Maybe an Inter- national Committee for UFO Research is what we need. Norway and Denmark In Norway the national organization is called the Norsk UFO Center (Norwegian UFO Center). Their greatest achievement is the fact that they have created a continuing dialogue with the Norwegian military officials. The major Danish organization is called SUFOI (Scandinavian UFO Investigation). It was the first UFO organization in all the Scandinavian countries. It was founded in 1957 and at first it operated as an umbrella organization for all Scandinavian countries. This sort of pioneering work was extremely valuable. Later on SUFOI has concentrated on domestic cases even though they still have members in Norway. At the moment SUFOI has as many as 6,000 members. The same portion of population here in the U.S. would mean a total of half a million members. UFO research in the Scandinavian countries is surprisingly lively. We have had limited resources, but we have been able to make it work. We all hope to see a deeper international cooperation in the future, both between the various organizations and within the framework of the United Nations.

Clemens, Michigan. The photos showed a discoid with a tail and antenna in the rear of the craft. Tree branches were quite visible in the foreground. The clarity of the photos along with the fact that the UFO was seen only a mile from Selfridge Air Force Base brought a quick investigative response from the Air Force. Dr. J. Allen Hynek, than a consultant with the Air Force's Project Bluebook, was quoted in REAL magazine's 1967 Flying Saucers Pictorial as saying, \"Analysis so far does not show any indication of an obvious hoax. The striking thing to me is the similarity these pictures have to other photos I have seen and also to verbal descriptions I've taken from ostensibly reliable people. To the best of my recollection, even the 'antenna' shown on the back has been previously reported, as has the tail structure \"(In Dr. Hynek's Edmund Scientific tape- casette program \"UFO/IFO,\" he says he was only partially convinced of the photos being genuine.) But, was this an aunthentic photo case? No. Years later, one of the brothers wrote Dr. Hynek and confessed that they had hoaxed the encounter by photographing a model on a very fine thread. Their motive â€” they merely wanted some attention. Now we have improved photo analysis techniques, including computer enhancement analysis, to help \"weed out\" such hoaxes. Nevertheless, it's possible to create some astounding fakes if one is well- skilled in model building and photography. The intent of this report is to brief investigators on how easy it is Photo by Wayne LaPorte inspired by recent controversy on the Meier case to build UFO models. Hopefully, this knowledge will help on any photo cases. And, this information will also enable an investigator to build a UFO model for the den, home library, or special public displays. Currently, there are two plastic injection molded UFO hobby kits available at most hobby stores. Lindberg Products, Inc., 8050 N. Monticello Avenue, Skokie, IL 60076 makes a 6-inch diameter discoid model molded of \"glow-in-the-dark\" plastic. It has a bubble canopy and comes complete with a \"little green man.\" Monogr?.m Models, Inc., 8601 Waukegan Rd., Morton Grove, IL 60053 manufactures a 7 l / 2 \" diameter model (in one inch equals six feet scale) of the bell-shaped UFO in \"The Invaders\" TV series. The kit comes with both a humanoid crew and humans (MIB or abductees!) The top can be removed to reveal a detailed interior. Monogram also makes a model of the Flying Sub from the TV series \"Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea.\" Built as is, it looks remarkably like some UFOs that have been seen rising out of the sea. Monogram also markets a model of the Cylon Base Star from the TV series \"Battlestar Galactica.\" The upper and lower discoid-shaped sections can be assembled separately to make two UFOs. Also, Monogram puts out a kit of the U.S.S. Skipjack atomic submarine which can easily be converted into a cigar-shaped UFO model. Only the two hull halves need be glued together. However, to create a blunt exhaust end will require use of a hobby razor saw or hot knife. Use either one of these tools to remove the rear tip to simulate an exhaust port at the tail end. Many arts and crafts stores stock clear plastic vacuformed transparent domes, bubbles, and spheres. By 8"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"(Model UFOs, Continued) trimming and joining these parts with sheet plastic stock, many different types of half-moon, saturn-type, discoids, and bell-shaped craft can be built. Scissors or an Xacto knife will be required to cut the plastic. Cut edges can be sanded smooth with wet-dry sandpaper. Liquid plastic cement should be used to glue parts together as regular plastic tube cement has a tendency to eat through thin plastic. Finally, the assembled model should be spray painted silver. Testors makes a very good silver spray paint available in small spray cans. Also, many craft stores stock a large selection of balls, cones, eggs, and cones made of styrofoam. These shapes can be spray painted or airbrushed to simulate \"glowing UFOs.\" Plastic LEGGS hosiery containers make excellent egg-shaped UFOs. Half-moon UFOs can be created by using the half-sections and adding sheet plastic bottoms to the half-sections. Many , hobby stores sell model rocket parts which include nose cones and body tubes of different sizes. These parts can be used to make conical and cylindrical UFOs. Spherical craft can be modeled by spray painting hard rubber balls or ping pong balls. Windows in the ping pong balls can be made by drilling holes with a power drill or hobby motor tool. Airborne \"flying saucer\" photo hoaxes can be accomplished by throwing hubcaps, frisbees, frisbees with vacuformed domes glued to them, or weighted scratch-built UFO models made of vacuformed domes. And, a manufacturer of gas-powered model airplanes has just marketed a gas- powered UFO! Anyone with a basic knowledge of electronics and carpentry can construct a homemade vacuform machine using a home vacuum cleaner as a vacuum pump. This device allows a heated piece of plastic (which in a heated state is like a sheet of rubber) to be sucked over a mold until it cools to form a rigid plastic shape conforming to the original mold. Pots, pans, dishes, bowls, or shapes carved out of balsa wood can be used as molds. This takes some time and skill to do, but the NEW MOVIE \"HANGAR 18\" DEPICTS UFO RETRIEVAL Sunn Classics Productions, headquartered in Salt Lake City, has released a film --fict ion-entitled \"Hangar 18\" surmising what would happen if the government retrieved a flying saucer. It surmises that a vast cover-up would en<=ue, with violent repressive action toward those in the know. A few years ago Sunn Classics was working on a factual documentary to feature reported \"retrieval\" cases. Why they switched to fiction, and what effect this will have on efforts to ascertain the truth, is not known. Contributing Editor Mildred Biesele visited Sunn Classics headquarters, talked to representatives, and obtained still photographs from the movie, one of which is shown here. Chuck Sellier, president of Sunn Classics, recently described their use of computers to determine what people want to see, and people were found to be very interested in UFOs. \"They believe that flying saucers exist, they believe that the government has come kind of contact with flying saucers, and they presume that if the government had, they would not teli anyone,\" he said. \"Almost 80% of the population believes literally in those statements.\" Sellier also reported that the Defense Department refused to cooperate with them, and suggested \"they might seek an injunction to keep us from making the picture.\" The company was forced to find an abandoned Air Force base as a production site; other scenes were shot in the mountains around Salt Lake City. ,,v,ii..c**to-..*Â«..wÂ«.~-. ua^j^^ AUtNS NASA n-fpa ctoeh [P&nQiQ toiiw W mews Mongol lfl \" models developed can be very realistic looking. The appearance of UFO models can be enhanced by installing miniature lamps, light emitting diodes, and fiber optics. Lighted models photographed in low light conditions while suspended by fishing line can produce very authentic-looking UFO photo hoaxes. The realism of scenes from many current sci-fi movies attest to what a skilled modeler and photographer can do. A simple technique is to photograph the UFO hanging on a string or fishing line, make a blow-up of the photo, airbrush out the string and add haze, and then re-photograph the touched-up photo using a close-up lens.

By Dr. Louis Winkler (MUFON Consultant in Astronomy) (The following note is based on an article by Dr. Winkler entitled \"Vulcan and Other 19th Century UFOs\" which won \"Honorable Mention\" in the 1980 competition sponsored by the Griffith Observatory of Los Angeles, for writings in popular astronomy. The article will eventually appear in the Griffith Observer.) Vulcan has long been classified among the strange phenomena, and Charles Fort included commentary and source references regarding the object in his collected works. More specific associations of Vulcan and UFOs have also been made, especially in the listing by Jacques Vallee as part of Flavio Pereira's collection of early UFO phenomena. Pereira's valuable work is a relatively obscure publication entitled \"O Livro Vermelho Dos Discos Voadores\" which appeared during 1966 in Sao Paulo. The 19th century was an era of discovery for astronomy involving nearly 100 new objects in the solar system, including comets, asteroids, moons of planets, and the planets Neptune and Vulcan. During this century numerous professional astronomers thought they saw Vulcan, which often appeared as a small, black disk slowly crossing the face of the sun. It allegedly had an orbit well contained within the orbit of Mercury, but the planet has never been confirmed definitively. Although Vulcan is unlike modem UFO accounts of vehicles or encounters, there may still be something to glean regarding the associated psychological phenomena. Many competent astronomers not only thought they saw Vulcan but were also involved in other unusual observations. The following is a brief account of these frailties of the mind where the individual is faced with critical decisions of reality or illusion. The central figure in the Vulcan 10 affair was the prominent French astronomer, U.J.J. Leverrier, who was given principal credit for the discovery of Neptune in 1846. His highly respected reputation in the field of celestial mechanics and conviction of the existence of Vulcan helped sway many to believe in Vulcan also. If Leverrier was able to predict the existence of a new planet with the aid of theoretical astronomy, why not a second planet in a similar fashion? In addition to the many observations of Vulcan made by others, Leverrier was linked to other unusual observations when in 1864 he filed a report with the prestigious French Academy of Science of a phenomenon occurring in the sky. His report consisted of three letters from witnesses regarding a \"large, luminous torpedo shaped object,\" which is similar to some of our more modern UFO reports. Apparently Leverrier never made any unusual observations himself since his time was consumed as a theorist and administrator. The person who triggered the intensive search for Vulcan in 1859 was E. Lescarbault, a French physician and amateur astronomer. Although many before Lescarbault saw unexplained small, dark disks cross the sun, the air of discovery was strong and Leverrier felt that Lescarbault had seen an intra- Mercurial planet. So Leverrier made an announcement to the French Academy of Science, urging observers to search for an intra-Mercurial planet. Lescarbault not only thought he saw Vulcan in 1859 but he also thought he saw a nova in 1885, which at the time was a candidate for being only the second nova to be discovered telescopically. This candidacy, however, was quickly terminated when it was discovered that Lescarbault mistook the planet Saturn for the Nova. Among the astronomers who made early observations of small, dark disks transiting the sun was F. von P. Gruithison. In 1819 he made five such observations which many other astronomers later took as observations of an intra-Mercurial planet. And it apparently did not bother too many people that in 1821 and 1822 Gruithison also saw clouds on the moon as well as urban developments in progress with \"streets, buildings and fortifications.\" Of course with our modem direct exploration of the moon we find no atmosphere or sign of life or archeological remains of cities. It is unlikely that the above observers or others confused their small, round spots with sunspots because sunspots are identified by their irregular shape arid shadowy peripheral structure. Further, sunspots reappear about one month later as the sun rotates, but these small, round spots did not. Possibly their observations were of a residual ring of material close to the sun. It was only in 1977 that Uranus was shown to have rings, and only in 1979 that a ring of Jupiter was discovered. But, if there was ring material about the sun during the 19th century it is difficult to explain why none is detected now. A German astronomer, J.G. Galle, was the first to see the planet Neptune in 1846 with the guidance of Leverrier's calculations, and he received the Red Eagle medal for his contribution. Galle, however, went on to make one of the most bizarre astronomical observ- ations ever recorded in the professional journals. In 1873 he and others saw a \"meteor that first appeared to emerge and separate itself from the disk of the planet Mars and enter our atmosphere.\" Another astronomer, H. Sage, who also observed the phenomenon said \"the planet appeared as if it was breaking up and dividing into two parts.\" Not only is Mars still in one piece, distance and time considerations of the \"meteor\" indicate that the speed"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"BOOK REVIEW UFO's: The Greatest Mystery, by Hilary Evans (New Jersey: Chartwell Books, Inc.), 1979; 94 p. (Oversize book produced in England, printed in Hong Kong.) When I rounded up the other two 1979-vintage members of this genre of UFO book for a review in the MUFON UFO Journal (Jan. 1980), this particular volume had escaped my attention. Now, thanks to a bit of serendipity during my recent canvass of a Walden's Book Store in Newport News, Va., I'm able to remedy the omission. For stowed on the lower shelf of a display table were three copies of Ms. Evans's work, each bearing a sales sticker reading \"$4.95.\" Even before heading to the checkout counter, I was abuzz with hopes of rendering a studious comparison of this completion of the trilogy. \"On a scale of 1 to 3,\" asked my daughter, Gretchen (whom I deploy as a UFO-book scout when I enter a book store in her neighborhood), \"how will you rate this one?\" Before answering her, let me give you a rundown on contents and packaging. The text accompanying these colorful illustrations â€” both photographs and drawings â€” begins with a poem by an 11-year-old witness to a UFO sighting. To reduce an ages- old, worldwide mystery to the level of poetry is no mean feat, of course; but that's just what the author sets out to do, either consciously or sub- consciously â€” a disarming literary device, to say the least, and one that allows and encourages the reader to suspend any preconceived notions about the reality of reported UFO encounters. It's the poetry of the observer from afar, casting not judgment but perspective upon her chosen subject. Ms. Evans's commentary on what she terms the \"six shades of strangeness\" â€” lights, shapes, radar observations, and boardings â€” is a model of restraint in these days of extremist mouthings by pro and con UFO theorists. Her Fortean- philosophic approach is maintained throughout, and renews the reader's commitment to Charles Fort's tradition of enlightened skepticism in journeying through the tricky landscape of contemporary UFOIogy, whether one be a novice traveler (to which this book seems aimed) or a seasoned explorer. The scenery along the way includes several classic histories selected, summarized, and illustrated to pose a thesis: \"If these people saw what they said they saw, then these objects, whatever they are, must surely be the most remarkable phenomena ever reported by anyone, anywhere, at any time.\" Among the landmarks of this eclectic, chronological journey are the prophetic insights of the early science- fiction writers, the case for \"natural causes,\" the \"airship\" invasion of 1897 in America, the foo fighters/ghost rockets era, the Kenneth Arnold saga, the Capt. Mantell death, the contactee heyday (including the dubious contribution of that shameless shaman of saucerism, George Adamski). Of the contactee clan, Ms. Evans ponders: What motivation lies behind their extraordinary claims? Somebody certainly is being taken for a ride, but who? Though some acquired a short-lived celebrity, and a few made a little money from books and lecturing, by and large the contactees made no worthwhile material gains. Rather it seems as though the phenomenon represents another aspect of that strange psychological compulsion which spurs so many people to make false confessions when a particularly'sensational murder is reported by the media, or to report visions of the Blessed. Virgin. It is not deliberate . . deceit, not calculated greed for fame or fortune â€” just a lonely impulse, part comic and part pathetic. From that discussion, the author proceeds to the question of \"conspiracy\" to account for the world governments' reluctance to take the UFO matter seriously. Then she dips further into the controversy by serving up a desciption of the \"Three Men in Black\" post-UFO encounter syndrome. What gives this encyclopedic study its enduring quality is its willingness to ask the hard questions â€” hard not just for the \"nonbeliever\" in UFO reality, but also for the \"true believer,\" that person who zealously clings to the flimsiest threads of UFOric theory or thesis. Indeed, the book's last seven topics are framed as questions on the possible origin of the pesky UFO's: \"Natural phenomena? Here on Earth? From under the ocean? Extrater- restrial? All in the mind? Alternative (Continued on page 17) (Vulcan, Continued) of light was exceeded, violating Einstein's special theory of relativity. Two noteworthy American astronomers who participated in observations of Vulcan were J.C. Watson and L. Swift. In 1869 Watson received the Lelande medal for discovering numerous asteroids, while Swift discovered 14 comets from the year 1877 to 1899, making him one of the most prolific comet discoverers in the history of astronomy. But in spite of their observational skills each saw an object in the vicinity of the sun during a total eclipse in 1877 which he thought to be Vulcan. Although it could be deduced from their observations that they saw different objects; and were thus implying that there were two Vulcans, neither admitted to error in observation. It is likely that each of these observers mistook stars in rhe vicinity of the sun for Vulcan during the time of the eclipse. During the 19th century there was an air of expectation of discovery in the solar system causing many to see a non- existent planet and possibly other illusionary phenomena. And among these observing vignettes of Vulcan there is a thread of thought which is remindful of our modem UFOs. In the 20th century there is an air of acceptance of interplanetary travel since astronauts have set foot on the moon, and scientists have landed instruments on Mars and Venus, and made flybys of Mercury and Jupiter. Could the expectation of further extra- terrestrial travel produce over- interpreted visual sightings of UFOs? If the analogy between 20th century UFOs and 19th century Vulcan holds, then we should expect a significant proportion of the UFOs authenticated by ufologists to be illusionary. 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"AIDS TO THE UFO INVESTIGATOR: A BIBLIOGRAPHY By Vicente-Juan Ballester Olmos (Guardia Civil,9,D-16, VALENCIA-20, Spain) This is a preliminary bibliography covering references to published works on methods, techniques, systems, and information which may assist the UFO researcher in the isolation and study of the unidentifiable residue of the general UFO phenomenon input from an objective viewpoint.

When this occurs, we are in most cases unprepared and startled, just as any other witness. Regrettably, ufology has not yet reached the stage where researchers have at their disposal proper tracking and documenting equipment to fully record a UFO event. The following incident, which seems in my opinion to fit peripherally into an \"unidentified flying object\" classification, occurred on September 7,1978.1 have waited this long to report it because it was controversial even among the four researchers who witnessed it. However, recently other UFO researchers in this area have urged that it be published. The event indicated that there are possibly conuentiona/ objects flying in our skies which cannot, under ordinary circumstances, be positively identified as conventional. Our-\"night on the mountain\" and its subsequent events began as a result of interviews held by MUFON investigator Morrey Allan and myself with Douglas Kriese, an 18-year-old security guard who reportedly viewed an \"apple-colored\" glowing object land near a manufacturing plant in .Sylmar, California. 1 In the course of our prolonged investigation, Kriese related to us that a group of his friends and he 1. See MUFON UFO Journal, March 1978, \"California Report\" column. had seen a bright, blinking beam of light envelop their pick-up truck on an isolated stretch of mountain road in nearby Little Tunjunga Canyon. Kriese reported that he and several other young people traveled up the severely-rutted fire road late at night. Four miles off the main paved highway, they parked their vehicle on a widened place .in the road, where a flat piece of ground formed a sort of plateau. Suddenly, at about 11:00 p.m., a bright flash of light descended upon their truck, startling them. Kriese could see the brilliant white light relfected on the hood. The light repeated flashing with frequent but irregular rhythm. None of the group could see the source of the light, except that it seemed to come directly from the sky above. Fearfully, they sped back down the chuck-holed road as fast as they could. The light followed their truck precisely, flashing periodically. Each time, the glow streamed over their car, as if traveling in perfect unison with them. As soon as they turned onto the paved main highway, the light disappeared. Kriese could remember no sounds accompanying the strange light. Intrigued by this first incident, the group of young people went back at least twice to check it out. Each time, at about 11:00 p.m. the light reappeared, flashing down upon their vehicle, and the incredible chase down the mountain would begin anew. Always, the light abruptly left them as they reached the paved highway which led further down the mounain to the settled communities below. Rather hesitatingly, Kriese said that the last of these incidents was about one month prior to the date of the reported Sylmar landing (March 6, 1977), which would place it sometime in February 1977. On this last occasion, the group experienced what seemed to be a time lapse of about 15 minutes during their frantic ride down the fire road, chased by the brilliant light. One of the young men had noticed the time the light appeared, and it seemed that it had taken their vehicle about 20 minutes longer than usual to make the trip down to the paved highway. Kriese made no claims regarding this apparent lapse of time. The idea of hypnotic regression was suggested to him as a possible means of clarifying the incident, and the young guard seemed amenable toward this. Later, however, he withdrew from any further investigation, and contact with him was lost. There are two possible reasons by Kriese ceased his cooperation: Either the landing report made by Kriese on March 6, 1977, was frowned upon by the security company for which he worked, or members of his family resented the investigators' interest in their son. Whatever Kriese's reasons, Morrey Allen and I were fascinated by his report of the regularly recurring nature of the chasing light and determined to check out the situation ourselves. The bitter night chill of winter and torrential rains of the following spring prevented speedy (Continued on next page) 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"(California Report, Continued) followup, and the fire road was washed out in places during subsequent flooding. Finally, however, on September 7, 1978, a group of four investigators took two cars up the same dirt road Kriese had pointed out to us. In one car were Allen, his daughter Mickey, and myself. In the secnd car were Raymond Bayless and D. Scott Rogo, well-known Southland psychic researchers who were interested in UFOs and the inherent parapsychological aspects apparent in many reports. About 4 miles up the unpaved fire road, we reached the wide place in the road which had been described by Kriese. We parked the two cars off the road about 200 feet apart (pointed down the trail for a quick getaway) and waited. We oriented our directions by the stars and watched the sky. The evening was clear, crisp, and dark. The moon, still in crescent stage, was not visible. There was absolutely no source of light from any direction on the darkened road. By walking about 50 yards to the south we could see, down the steep mountainside, the faraway foothill communities. We were at about 5,000 feet, and the lights clumped together like spilled displays of industrial diamonds. It was cold in the open, however, even though it was still summer, for the unrestrained wind brought the chill factor down to wintry standards. We decided to wait in the cars. Sometime around 10:30, from Allen's car, we sighted a yellowish light of first degree magnitude rising above the low horizon in the north-northeast. It took an easterly course as it crept slowly upward, at an angular speed of about 3 degrees during 10 minutes. This course negated our first impression that it might be a star. We were expectant, and Allen, Mickey, and I took turns flashing a light toward it in hopes of attracting attention. Our signals produced no reaction, and presently to the right of the bright light a group of three smaller white lights were seen rising alongside it. It was then that it became apparent that the bright object was Capella, and the smaller accompanists were the \"kids\" of \"the goat.\" Although not circumpolar at our 16 latitude, Capella has enough of a northerly declination to appear to be rising up and eastward (for a short while). It was a rare and unexpected treat for inveterate city dwellers. We settled back to await 11:00 p.m. As that hour approached, we suddenly saw a bright yellow light in the west. When first seen, it was about magnitude â€”1 but quickly grew in size. In about a minute it was approximately 70 degrees elevation and about magnitude â€”5. Through the open windows of Allen's car we heard a muted but unmistakable sound of a helicopter, flying about 1,000 feet above the terrain. The only lighting on the otherwise invisible body of the craft was a curious \"smear\" of golden-yellow light. No other identifying lights were visible. The smeared light is difficult to describe, and even among the five observers there was controversy about it. Rogo did not see anything odd about the yellow light, and feels the only unusual thing about the helicopter was the lack of blinking lights. However, the rest of the observers felt that the yellow light, ragged but yet self-contained, was not part of any normal lighting for any kind of aircraft. The only way I can describe the effect as I saw it is this: take the incandescence of a burning bulb filament, color it golden, and smear it like paint on the hull of a flying craft. As the helicopter flew in a straight path closer toward us, we could see that the smeared light covered a large portion of the hull and did not relfect light onto the unlit portion. On a whim I signalled the helicopter with my flashlight. Almost immediately, Allen's car in which three of us were sitting was flooded by a beam of bright light, bluish-white in color. It came from the craft above us, but we were too startled to watch the action. We drew in our heads like startled turtles. Bayless, sitting in Rogo's car behind us, saw the light beam stream down, extending perhaps 50 feet out onto the vegetation on each side of the road. But curiously, Bayless thought that the beam, which was sustained for a short time but not confined to a quick, sudden flash, had been directed toward Rogo's car instead of Allen's. He did not remember seeing Allen's car bathed in light at any time and, like us, saw only one manifestation of the light beam. The light went out quickly and was not repeated. Leaping from our cars, we saw the craft, still with a broad, smear of golden-yellow light covering what now seemed to be the back bottom portion of the hull, leisurely fly off straight to the east. By the time we piled out of the cars, the craft was about 70 degrees high in the east. It had taken only a few seconds to travel 40 degrees. Still there were no other identifying or navigational lights visible. It traveled a straight easterly course away from us and disappeared in apparently normal fashion into the distance. Shortly afterward, we headed for our , respective homes. What kind of helicopter flies without proper navigational lights? No flashing white strobe lights, or red or green lights, or any color of navigational lights, blinking or steady. Only that smear of golden light along the hull, the like of which I had never seen before. Allen later suggested that the \"smear\" might be luminous paint, perhaps a means of recognition by persons who for reasons of their own prefer not to use conventional, legally required, and easily recognized lighting. But the smear looked too brilliant to be ordinary luminous paint. I do not mean to suggest that the craft was one of the so-called \"mystery helicopters\" of UFO fame. Except for the odd lighting, its flight behavior was normal. Convinced that we had seen what Kriese had described, Allen and I felt rewarded for the experience, even though the craft had not chased our car down the fire road in a headlong chase. But this brought up another minor puzzling point. Why should the truck in which Kriese and his buddies traveled be harrassed by repeated flashes of light as they sped down the unpaved road? It was suggested that the craft pursued Kriese and his friends because they seemed to be running away. Our two cars, sitting stationary on the side of the fire road, apparently warranted no more than a cursory glance from whoever piloted the craft. Since we did not run away, and because we were in two cars instead of one, did the pilot of the craft decide that we were not signalling for help? Whatever, it seems"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"(California Report, Continued) we did not warrant further investigation. I continued to puzzle, however, over the manner in which the helicopter immediately flooded the position of our car without first searching for the precise spot. This aspect is what had puzzled Kriese also, how the light beam precisely hit their x:ar every time it flashed on, even when traveling down the bumpy, uncertain road. Why didn't Kriese report hearing noise from the direction of the flashing light? Young people sitting in cars at night talk, laugh, and make all sorts of commotion. The soft whir of the high- flying chopper must have gone unnoticed, especially during their noisy confusion which broke out each time the light beam flooded their vehicle. My subsequent efforts to identify this strangely-lit craft met with no success. Contacting the local FAA only confirmed what we alread knew â€” that readily visible and recognizable flying lights are legally required on all helicopters, military, police, sheriff, fire department, and private alike. The most logical explanation seemed to be that the helicopter was a regular surveillance craft for the forestry service in the area. I called the Agriculture Deparment, which conducts forestry services for the Angeles Crest Mountains, and learned that there are no regular night surveillance flights from this department. The only time helicopters fly over the mountains on behalf of the Forestry Service is in the case of brush fires. The local Sheriff Department sometimes patrols in the mountains above Tujunga, but usually not at night. There are helicopters from the Los Angeles Police Department, other city police departments, and military and private helicopters which travel at night over the mountains and/or foothills, but all of these, without exception, are required by the FAA to bear proper and easily recognizable lighting. In speaking with Mr. Yarbrough, - Fire ; Management Officer for the Tujunga District of the Forestry Service, I was unable to obtain any useful information as to the possible identity of the chopper we viewed on September 7, 1978. Besides the puzzle of the lack of proper lighting, he stated that usually helicopter pilots, when using their searchlights, have to search around a bit with their light beams before precisely focusing them on a specific target. Therefore, this apparently normal helicopter contains two puzzling aspects: its curious lighting and its ability to pinpoint an object 1,000 feet below with instantaneous success. In spite of our continued curiosity, no return trips have been made by investigators to that lonely wide spot in the road 5,000 feet above the city lights. Without adequate surveillance equipment, what would be gained? Could a camera with . tripod and telephoto lens capture a picture of the craft? What would a spectrogram of the yellow-golden light reveal? Where is the equipment, the time, and the funds for such research? For the time being, our night on the mountain will have to remain as it is â€” a blend of identified and unidentified, an unsolved mystery. A final question. If unmarked helicopter(s) with illegal lighting travel boldly and repeatedly over the mountains east of the heavily populated Los Angeles Basin, are other aircraft, equally enigmatic, flying over other areas of our country? Do they belong, perhaps, to some type of governmental authority which declines to obey FAA laws? Could this be a partial explanation, at least, to some \"UFO\" reports? (Book Review, Continued) universe? Menace or miracle?\" And finally, the author's invitation to join in the exploration of those issues ends in a question: Man is pushing back the frontiers of knowledge faster now than ever in his history, and though some of us still continue to behave with appalling stupidity, as a whole the human race seems to be increasing in wisdom as well as in know- how. Many today would scorn the suggestion that the UFO has a vital part to play in that development. Yet man has .always increased his knowledge by solving the problems which perplexed him: in trying to solve the problem of the UFO â€” surely the most perplexing phenomenon which , has ever confronted man â€” he may have to redraft established laws of physics, rethink existing notions of space and, time, make whatever changes to the structure of his knowledge that have to be made to accomodate this new phenomenon, and in I Mark R.

Perhaps that is the secret of the UFO: perhaps it is a sum scribbled oh a blackboard, seemingly meaningless to our eyes, but designed by some great teacher to stretch our minds a little further? So now, Gretchen, back to your question: on a scale of 1 to 3, where do I place this contribution to graphic UFOlogy?

Your Director is soliciting from Journal readers one of the posters advertised by Ancient Astronauts magazine, since it appears doubtful that I will receive one from the original source. At first it may appear that the bubble has been broken, since this explanation implies that one set of the photographs has a logical answer. Mr. Stringfield has been totally aware of the probable source of the photographs and why someone or some agency would desire to discredit the research he has done in the retrieval cases. Leonard has advised your Director that the photographs were delivered to him by a person who secured them from a second party that is a member of an intelligence agency. With this knowledge, most investigators would probably cease and desist further research into the photos, but this has not deterred Mr. Stringfield. Len is exploring every scientific avenue to determine the authenticity of the photographs by securing the professional advice of medical people, photographers, zoologists, and biologists, who are conducting extensive tests. Their results, to date, have been very enlightening on the positive side, therefore the investigation continues. The September 30th issue of the Globe, a weekly tabloid featured a story titled \"Photos of dead alien expose UFO cover-up.\" More than forty photographs of a wrecked UFO and its charred pilot were given to Charles J. Wilhelm, Dennis Pilichis, and Willard Mclntyre by a veteran navy photographer who has kept them secret for 32 years. Mr. Wilhelm, a MUFON State Section Director living in Fairfield, Ohio, released two of the photos for publication in the GLOBE, purported to show a charred body, allegedly that of a UFO pilot who crashed in northern Mexico, about 30 miles south of Laredo, Texas, in 1948. These photographs will require the same painstaking investigation that Mr. Stringfield has conducted in his research to determine their authenticity. Are these alleged photographs a \"break through\" in crash/retrievals, or do they constitute a systematic pattern to discredit the parties involved? Only concentrated and detail study will reveal the truths. . Two new State Section Directors were appointed since the last issue of the Journal. Dana M. Schmidt, J.D., a patent attorney, residing at 47 Aspen Drive, Rochester, NY 14625, has responsibility for the New York counties of Monroe, Wayne, and Ontario. Greg Long, a former field investigator in Colorado now living in Washington State, has been assigned the counties of Franklin, Benton, and Walla Walla. A former school teacher, Greg is now employed as a technical editor. His address is 50 Jadwin, #114, Richland, WA 99352. David G. Walley, 525 West End Avenue, New York; NY 10024, has volunteered as a Research Specialist. Stanton T. Friedman and his family have moved from Hay ward, Calif., to the capital city of New Brunswick. They have established a residence at 110 Kings College Road, Fredericton, NB E3B 2E7, Canada. Stan has been invited to represent MUFON as the Provincial Director for both New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. He has advised that the producer of his film \"UFOs Are Real\" has changed the title to \"Alien Encounter,\" but still has not released the movie to the theaters. It is available from your' local Fotomat outlet on one-half inch video tape under its original name for either VHS or Beta reproduction. We are extremely proud to announce the publication of a new book compiled by George M. Eberhart, MUFON Staff Librarian, titled \"A Geo- Bibliography of Anomalies: Primary Access to Observations of UFOs, Ghosts, and Other Mysterious Phenomena.\" This is a culmination of many years of research by Mr. Eberhart on paranormal experiences covering 20,000 separate events from across the United States, as well as Canada and Greenland. Biological, physical, and meteorological mysteries are examined from lake monsters to spontaneous human combustion. Parapsychology is represented by cases of poltergeist, clairvoyance, precognition, psychic photography, and many other psychic processes. Phenomena suggesting alternative realities such as ghosts communications with the dead, and close encounters with UFOs are included. The book is indexed in such a geographical manner that finding a particular event, or a particular kind of event, becomes a simple task. This is the first, .and the only, case-by-case bibliography ever devoted to these strange events. This 1114 paged book, priced at $59.95, was published by Greenwood Press, Westport, Conn., and London, England, and released August 1980. George had access to all copies of SKYLOOK and the MUFON UFO Journal, starting from September 1967 to the present. He has acknowledged the help of the following MUFON members in his book: Lucius Parish, Robert G. Neeley, Jr., and Walter H. Andrus, Jr. After three years of publishing problems, Thomas E. Bearden, MUFON Consultant in Nuclear Engineering, has published his new book titled \"The Excalibur Briefing\" in which he explains paranormal phenomena. Mr. Bearden presented a paper at the 1979 MUFON UFO Symposium in San Francisco and submitted a published paper for the 1980 MUFON UFO Symposium Proceedings, so many readers are familiar with his work. Colonel Bearden endeavors to show precisely what UFOs are and how they are formed, what the bioenergy is in Hieronymus devices, thought photography, psychic surgery, and psychokinetics. He explains the strange cattle mutilations, and shows that UFO waves precisely fit predictions for the future.

The contents of October UFO REPORT includes articles by Jerome Clark, Jim Miles, Stanton Friedman, Ronald Edwards, and others. Topics covered include the \"crashed saucers\" reports, UFO ground effects, UFO films, the California \"airships\" of 1896, etc. The October issue of FATE has an article by Robert K.G. Temple, \"In Defense of THE SIRIUS MYSTERY,\" which is a response to James Oberg's skeptical â€¢ look at the Temple book/theory (FATE, November 1978). Temple concludes his article by saying, \"In my view, it is pointless to attack someone in print unless you can substantiate what you are saying. Since Oberg cannot do so, we need not concern ourselves with his criticisms of THE SIRIUS MYSTERY.\" The lack of substantiation in the various \"super- skeptic\" charges is also demonstrated by a long refutation of an Oberg article on Velikovsky in the October issue of ASTRONOMY. A couple of interesting articles on phantom submarines and Bigfoot can be found in the #19 issue of TRUE UFOs & OUTER SPACE QUARTER- LY, but most of the other material is rehash and/or non-UFO-related. The same could be said for the #12 issue of IDEAL'S UFO MAGAZINE and the #9 issue of UFO UPDATE, although the latter publication does have a few items of interest. Well-known astronomer Dr. Robert Jastrow contributes an article on UFOs to the November/December issue of the \"new\" SCIENCE DIGEST. Although Dr. Jastrow draws no firm conclusions on UFO visitations, he does not rule out the possibility of highly advanced extraterrestrials being responsible for some of the reports. Attempting to keep up with what used to be the INTERNATIONAL UFO REPORTER seems to be as difficult as keeping up with UFOs! The IUR ceased publication, with plans to publish a column of UFO news in each bi-monthly issue of PROBE. After two issues, that publication has now folded and the \"IUR\" material has been shifted to SECOND LOOK (now re-titlÂ«d FRONTIERS OF SCIENCE). It will now (supposedly) appear in each issue . of that magazine. Stay tuned for our next installment in this continuing saga! We've heard them for 30 years, those fascinating, but apocryphal, stories of how UFOs supposedly crashed in Mexico or Arizona or New Mexico or any one of a few dozen other locations. Mostly, they've been just that â€” stories. But, did something actually happen near Roswell, New Mexico, in, July 1947, which served as an inspiration or starting point for all the rumors? This is the theme of the new book by Charles Berlitz and William L. Moore, THE ROSWELL INCIDENT. The authors contend, on the basis of their extensive research into the story, that a UFO did crash in the New Mexico desert, with its remains (including alien humanoids) being confiscated by the military and taken to Wright Field (now Wright-Patterson Air Force Base), Ohio. The book is marred by the inclusion of unverified material (though not necessarily information pertaining directly to the book's central theme), but when the authors stick to the events which allegedly occurred near Roswell, they provide some fascinating data. There is no proof that crashed saucers exist, but there is certainly enough information to strongly suggest that they do. THE ROSWELL INCIDENT makes for highly interesting reading.

The featured speakers were J. Allen Hynek, Ph.D., Director of CUFOS; Thomas Gates, MUFON Consultant in Astronomy; Paul Cerny, Western States Regional Director; and Marvin Taylor. MUFON of Northern California followed this fine event by sponsoring Dr. J. Allen Hynek in a lecture on October 16, 1980, at the Civic Auditorium in Redding, Calif., arranged by Paul Cerny. With superb public education of this nature, it is understandable why MUFON has more members in California than in any other state. Each time Leonard Stringfield appears on a radio or television program, MUFON receives a deluge of orders for his monograph titled \"The UFO, Crash/Retrieval Syndrome\" Status Report II: New Sources, New Data published by the Mutual UFO Network, January 1980. ($5.00 postpaid from MUFON). His specialized work in this exciting field continues to produce- positive results. On August 21st, Len provided this brief up-date by telephone. He now has 18 first-hand witnesses who allegedly have seen the alien bodies. Of these 18, three new witnesses said they saw live bodies, one claimed to have seen three bodies being loaded into an ambulance, another saw one in Hawaii in 1944, while yet another reported having observed a single body at Wright- Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio. Before these new witness reports may be accepted as authentic, each must be checked out thoroughly. However, it is gratifying to know that people are now willing to come forward and disclose what they have seen provided that their names are not released to the press. As an example of the investigation that must take place concerning every report, I quote from my Director's Message in the July 1980 issue of The MUFON UFO Journal. \"A bombshell was dropped at the symposium when Leonard H. Stringfield, author of The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome' announced that he had brought eight photographs showing a preserved body in a glass box with possibly nitrogen gas circulating within the container. These alleged photographs are prints, both in black and white and color, given to him by a person from an intelligence agency of the U.S. government.\" Leonard did not allow these photographs to be reproduced by the news media, since their authenticity was still under investigation. Stanton Friedman, MUFON Consultant and William \"Bill\" Moore, State Section Director in Prescott, Arizona, continued their research into these questionable photographs and have found a logical source. The front cover of the November 1977 issue of \"Ancient Astronauts,\" published by Country- wide Publications, Inc. in New York City featured a replica of one of the photographs under the caption \"The humanoid found in cryogenic suspension within the SECRET CHAMBERS BENEATH THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING.\" A subsequent advertisement in the same magazine has the following quote: \"This is the startling photograph of a being discovered and carefully photographed by the government beneath the streets of New York City. It has become the most controversial and sought after indisputable physical evidence thus far, in the search to prove that there once existed on Earth an ancient civilization far superior to our own.
