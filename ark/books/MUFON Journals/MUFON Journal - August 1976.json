FROM THE EDITOR By all appearances, there could be a Men-In-Black con- spiracy at work here at the MUFON UFO JOURNAL! The pro- blems of new editorship and widely scattered printing, typesetting and mailing loc- ations were compounded by my new position as editor of OFFICIAL UFO. Besides hav- ing to set up an apartment in New York, I encountered almost inexplicable delays in mailing. To top it all off, the entire typesetting job for the July JOURNAL simply faded away one day. (This was inexplicable and I have yet to find a sat- isfactory explanation.) But hopefully we are back on the track. Sept- ember and October issues will follow shortly, and that will finally get us caught up. Vv'e still need volunteers to rewrite the many recent MUFON sighting reports for use in the JOURNAL. While it is hard to say how long I will be able to survive the dangers of New York City, let alone the pitfalls of the publishing industry, I must make one thing clear. At no time will I use material sub- mitted for this JOURNAL in any other publication. This of course was true when I edited UFCLCGY, but I feel it must be stressed with OFFICIAL UFO, a maga- zine which I must admit, never commanded much of my respect. I hope I will be able to change that in the future. In any case, it is better to have tried and lost than never to have tried at all. 1 In this issue SEDONA PHOTOGRAPH EVALUATION BY WILLIAM SPAULDING 3 UFO SHADES CAR - MAN DIES BY OTTO RAYMUNDO 6 TRAVIS WALTON ABDUCT I ON: PART II BY PHILIP KLASS 8 STANTON FRIEDMAN'S LECTURE SCHEDULE  ^^ DANISH PHYSICAL EVIDENCE CASE BY RICHARD HALL 15 SPANISH LABORER ATTACKED BY JOE BRILL  16 INT'L DATA EXCHANGE PROGRAM BY RICHARD HALL. 17 IN OTHERS WORDS BY Lucius FARISH  18 UFO LIGHT BEAM CASES BY RICHARD HALL  19 DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE BY WALT ANDRUS  20 ASTRONOMY NOTES BY MARK HERBSTRITT  20 Th< contents ol the MUFON UFO JOtlRrUl lr« determined by the editor, and do not necessarily represent tbe officill position or lodgement ol MUFON.

(copyright 1976) The initial photographic evaluation, performed by Dr. J. Ames Harder, appeared in the March-April 1973 issue of the APRO Bulletin. Dr. Harder's analysis into this anomalous phtograph involved the standard evaluation techniques, which in- volved: (A) a review of the witness' camera/lens system. (B) a close look at the negative under moderate magnification. (C) an evaluation of the wit- ness' verbal report on the sighting. Harder's analysis Upon completion of the same, this prompted Dr. Harder to make the following bberservations con- cerning the sighting. Apart from the character of the origional photographer, the analysis of te origional negative, and the cir- cumstances of it being found quite by accident, there remains a very cogent argument for authenticity: who would think a fake a UFO pic- ture of this sort? . The measurements from the negative reveals that from the lowest barely visible image to that of the brightest images is 0.14 inches. From the brightest image to the last visible image is 0.20 in- ches, and aboe that point there is a faint trace 0.10 inches in length, for a total size of 0.44 inches. At a calculated idstance of 4,000 feet from the witness, this represents a~ transverse distance of 700 feet, in which the object traveled in 29 milliseconds. This caculates to a speed of 16,000 miles per hour, several times faster than the average speed of a rifle bullet. One of the most fascinating aspects of the photograph is the large number of distinct images that appear. We must infer that the object is very brilliant (higher density level) •, brighter than any portion of the surronding sky. These distinct images are possibly due to one of two oc- curences as follows: 1. The flashing on anf off of a brilliant light source on the ob- jects. 2. The slowing down or stopping and immediate acceleration of the object, 15 to 20 times, during the 1/60 second shutter opening (speed) of the camera. This capulates the analysis of Dr. Harder on the Sadona UFO Track photograph. GSW computer analysis Due to the extraordinary con- clusion of this bit of UFO pictorial evidence and the fact that this pic- ture was photographed in a daylight mode, with sufficient lan- dscaping reference points, it was an ideal candidate for the com- puterized enhancement system. The lone witness to this sighting, Mr. C.D. Ghormley, was visiting Arizona. On September 23, 1967 .at approximately 1:30 P.M., near Sedona, the witness observed what he though to be a bright tank on a distant mountain and decided to photograph it with an inexpensive Kodak camera. According to the witness he took the picture and rolled the film to the next fram, when he looked back to see the object, all that.was present was a cloud of smoke or dust. Mr. Ghormley took his film to the photography shop of an APRO member, who in turn obtained this date . for Dr. Harder's evaluation. ' The Test Described A first generation copy of the picture was obtained for the com- puter evaluation. After a careful review by the GSW photo technicians it was determined that the following date points must be established to quantify this piece of possible UFO pic- torial evidence: A.- The exact distance of the \"object\" from the camera. B. The true size of the \"object\". C. The angular motion of the ' \"object.\" PAGE 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"range of the image. Areas shown as white and shades of blue and green represent respectively lighter film densities than areas shown as yellow and shades of violet and red. The thickness of an image is constant within all areas that are displaced as the same color. Identifying Apparent Shape When performing color/profiling tests on an image, its apparent shape can be iden- tified. For example: 1) A cloud would have a broken uneven density. 2) An aircraft body would naturally have a cylindrical shape with protrusions from wings, thus causing a variable density display. 3) A weather balloon would not have the density of that of a true metallic object, even if the balloon was photographed at a \"good\" sun angle. 4) A hoax photograph generally consists of such trite items as Frisbees (TM), camera lens caps, pie plates, etc. The density profile from such a common object would be one of low reflectivity and its obvious shape would be resolved when color contouring and magnification techniques were PAGE *4 added to this ultrasensitive, high resolution technique. A highly \"suspect\" UFO photograph would profile itself in- to a disc or ellipse shape with a general even density that is, brighter in the middle than the periphery, due to its con- figuration. This coloring effect has been noticed on numerous oc- casions during the interpretation of a \"bonafide\" object photo, especially when the object has been filmed in the edge profile (view). A profiling cursor denoted by the vertical white lines through our various test objects reveals the object's real shape—flat, round, disc, elliptical, etc. Hypothetically, if a UFO was a hoaxed item, such as a pie plate, montage, or a hub cap, the cursor lines would \"profile,\" with some respect to the density, into a flat, shallow shape. The same is true with a lens flare, a common photographic anomaly. Then logically, a tangible, metallic bonafide object would have a profiling cursor line(s) with sub- stance and shape. Step 3—Emage Enhancement, digitizing The last image test for this pic- ture is the digitizing of the image, for either a high resolution picture or a true analytical review of the data points on the film. A typical black and white photograph is called a continuous tone image because the shades of'grey blend continously, both in intensity (level) and spatiality (area). However, our evaluation system is not continuous, but crete grey level assigned to it. System resolution may therefore be defined as the ability to reproduce images with a visual quality that is comparable to the continuous-tone originals. THis requires a sufficient number of picture elements to give the ap- pearance of spatial continuity, and a sufficient number of grey levels to give appearance of depth and width. The pixel (picture (picture cell) is the basis element of picture resplution. Our system divides a picture into an array of 512 horizontal columns and 480 ver- tical rows, thus producing 245,760 equal and discrete pixels. Each pixel is then assigned a value based on the average level of grey contained on that minute portion of the picture it encomposses. The grey scale (density) of the pixels, ranges from 0 to 255,0 is black and 255 is white. When we digitized com- puterized the Sedona photograph, the true shape of the object was determined. The finished com- puterized photograph gives us hard data about the shape, den- sity, reflectivity, atmospheric light glare (veiling), a size relationship, and in some cases where more than One picture was taken, the angular motion. The enhancement of the data in our UFO pictorial evidence gives us vast quantities of data from a relatively \"poor\" original pic- ture. Our computer program for this type of work has the key func- tions of control and calibration of the film characteristics."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"D. The detail of the individual images. E. A complete digital den- sitometryscan. With the selection of the photographic test parameters completed, the next step was the analysis, utilizing the computer. Step 1 - Edge Enhancement To gain some of these additional data points from the picture, it was subjected to the edge enhance analysis. Wth enhancement, fine lines representing delicate struc- tures are magnified and made very distinct for visual analysis. The same technique has the ability to evaluate areas of any photograph or transparancy that has areas both over or under ex- posed. Hard date exists within these areas of light & dark densities. The human eye can not perceive detail in certian portions of photographs that lack proper den- sity (grey value). We subjected the photograph, Reference Figure 1, to the edge enhance process. The details are enhanced on the edges and exacting measuremen- ts can be obtained. By enhancing the edges of this photograph it now becomes practical to measure the object's aspect ratio exactly, without concern over fuz- zy edges caused by the un- sharpness factors. Edge enhancement helped with the intitial evaluation of the sub- ject film and operates in the following manner. A black line is produced on the T.V. display system when a normal image changes from white to black, or from a lighter to darker grey value. Conversely, just the op- posite occurs when we are working with a white line or lighter grey value. Then all bright and dark areas on the picture are suppressed to a simple shade of background grey. . In order to facilitate the analysis, the enhanced display can be adjusted for different degrees of enhancement; that is, from a normal photo to a fully enhanced one for optimum analysis. The width of the enhan- ced lines is adjustable from fine to very coars for maximal visibility of fine details. Step .2 - Color Enhancement- Profiling The next evaluation mode, Color Enhancement, offers the greatest amount of analytical data. The photograph was sub- jected to this system of the analysis to determine some of the hard data, which includes exact density of the object and its surrounding area, the average reflectivity of the object, the exact shape of the UFO, and a relationship of its true size to it distance perspective. The density was the first item attempted with the color analysis. The grey scale of a photograph is expressed in terms of photographic density (H & D Stan- dard units) which has different meanings in different pictures. In Reference Figure 2, the grey values are directly related to the cross- sectional thickness of the \"object (s).\" With the utilization of color enhancement the photographic density is elec- tronically analyzed. THe measurements taken from the color data, show clearly an uneven distribution of color. This indicates a non-homogeneous den- sity across the entire face protion of the UFO, ie, a tenous matter or one of varying cross sectional gemetry. Digital dehsitometry in- dicated slight variances in the above data; however, it is a mole highly sophisticated system than the color evaluation method. The Profiling technique was performed to gather data on the shape of the unidentified object in the picture. Reference Figures 1 and 2, note The profiling cursor and its result in each photograph. In these pictures the 90 degree profile of the image reveals a slightly wavy, flat, nonsubstance image, very similar to the shape of a reflection. The coloring technique -tran- sforms a bland, non-detailed photograph in vivid colors, in one of an infinite number of different color analysis. The data on any photographic medium is elec- tronically evaluated and classified into thirty colors plus black and white. In this case the full spectrum of color is divided equally over the toal density PAGE 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Conclusions It is the consensus of the GSW photographic techniques that the photograph tested represents the following: The Sedona, Arizona, photograph is a lens reflection and a typical example of a misin- dentification of a common anomaly. The computerized data has revealed information that totally supports the postulation as follows: 1) There is a complete lack of substance to the object, only length and width are displayed. 2) The profiler reveals the \"ob- ject\" (image) as a flat (light) source. 3) The irregularities in the color and digital densitomet effectively reveal the same data. 4) The irregular geometry, on the image's edges, violates stan- dard geometry shapes of previous objects that have been pat- ternized and categorized, even allowing for the unsharpness fac- tors and the hypothesized broken motion of the object. 5) The individual pixels (picture cell) data of the edges is relatively sharp, within the focus plane of the camera/lens system, indicative of non-movement. 6) with the type of camera and film utilized (AS A speed) it is sim- ply beyond the realm of possibility to photograph an \"ob- ject\" traveling the speed of a bullet, in 1-1/60 of a second. 7) Additional pixel data strongly suggests the images are fairly close to the camera. Distant objects would have been wavy and broken pixel edges and the distant factor would be heightened due to atmospherics and veiling glare. It is hoped that this broad look at a single UFO photograph and the value of the computer may stimulate wider applications of some of these newer photographic/computer ap- praoches PAGE 6 UFO Shades Car- Man Dies and Wife Turns White-headed! BY OTTO RAYMUNDO LOCATION: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil At summer resort (open ocean beach) named Recreio dos Bandierantes, near Barra da Tijuca. DATE: Possibly in 1954 or 1955 TYPE OF SIGHTING: UFO shades car in broad daylight, frightening occupants. CAUSES: Man had an inex- plicable death few days later and wife turns whiteheaded in a couple of months. SIGHTING BACKGROUNDS: A couple went out for a ride ashore, during a sunny day, despite it was not the summer season, and for this reason, location was very deserted. The riding was pleasant and confortable, looking at the landscape and taking the ocean breeze, until something very unusual happened... SIGHTING DESCRIPTION: Wit- ness stated that a large shadow suddenly covered the car, like pursuiting it along the seashore road. Was a huge round shadow, very strange, like coming down from a large umbrella above the car... Her husband pulled over, stopping the car. Taking a look out of the window, he stared at something hanging up there...like a huge metallic disk, hovering, silen- tly.... She did not look directly into the object as she was very puzzled, most with the reactions of her husband. She was really frightened and asked her husband what was all that. He hardly could tell her about what he saw, as he was stuttering almost totally unintelegible words. (I suppose he could never explain exactly what he really saw up there). Then, they decided at once to change the car riding to the way back home. SIGHTING EFFECTS: A few days later the man died of a sud- den unknown illness (causa- mortis was never mentioned to me). His wife became so puzzled and sorrowful, miserably sad enough to have her hair turned totally white, in a couple of mon- ths, or less... INVESTIGATIONS: This case came to my attention narrated by a close friend in Brazil and now is reconfirmed in a recent, letter to me. All efforts are now being made to locate this lady of white hair, perhaps the only witness of the case, in order to take her word once more (and record it). COMMENTS: By that time, South America (and Brazil in par- ticular), was very busy with sightings of all sorts, as stated by Frank Edwards in his book \"FLYING SAUCERS-HERE AND NOW! (Lyle Stuart, N.York, 1967), page 81: The year 1954 came in with a rush of UFOs. In Brazil they seemed especially active, buzzing automobiles along lonely stretches of high- ways, making near approaches to planes, interfering with elec- tric power transmission... Then, in page 83, I have found an intriguing case, very similar to the present one, in a way: In Brazil, a small automobile was overtaken by a UFO which swept overhead so close to the car that the car rose into the air and flipped into the ditch, for- tunately with little injury to either the car or the occupants."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"DRAWI.NG or THE Rio DE JANEIRO .(BRAZIL) SIGHTING' IN.WHICH A UFO FLEW -DIRECTLY OVER A CAR IN BROAD DAYL I GHT 1 .  , . • . e 1976 PAGE 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"THE TRAVIS BY PHILIP J. KLASS (AUTHOR OF UFOs EXPLAINED, RANDOM HOUSE 197*4 AND VINTAGE PRESS 1976) THIS IS 'TH.E! LAST OF A TWO-PART SERIES ON THE NOW FAMOUS TRAVIS WALTON ABDUCTION CASE. BE- CAUSE OF THE POSITIVE HANDLING THIS PUBLICATION GAVE THE CASE WHEN IT FIRST OCCURRED, WE THOUGHT IT IMPORTANT THAT ML) FON MEMBERS BE AWARE OF THE NEW FACTS BROUGHT TO LIGHT HERE. , If a UFO could abduct the Hills in New; Hampshire, why couldn't a-UFO abduct a wood-cutter in Arizona? After such a terrifying incident, it would be only natural for other members of the crew to refuse to return to the work-site. Rogers would now have grounds to claim that he simply could not complete his contract for reasons beyond his control. If the Forest Service agreed, Rogers could then collect the 10 per cent of his ear : ned funds that had been withheld and the crew would not have to wait until the following spring to receive all of their pay. Travis Walton would be the logical \"victim.\" His oft- expressed desire to ride on a UFO could explain his seemingly foolhardy act of running under the UFO. And his expertise in UFOlogy, compared to other crew members, would make it easier for him to concoct a story about his experiences aboard the UFO. Plans could be worked out in ad- vance for a hide-out, perhaps a cabin that would not be used during the winter months. Travis's mother was then living in a small house on the Gibson ran- ch, not far from the Turkey PAGE 8 Springs area where the crew was working. The two hours between the time that the incident allegedly occurred and the time when it was first reported to Un- der-Sheriff Ellison at Heber would allow plenty of time to drive Travis to the selected hide-out. (It may be simply coincidence, but the day after the UFO incident, Mrs. Kellet. decided to leave the Gibson ranch house and return to her home in Snowflake. This would avoid visits by law- enforcement officers to the Gib- son ranch house.) On Nov. 18, 1975, Rogers wrote to inform the Forest Service that he could not complete his contract because of the UFO incident \"which caused me to lose my crew and will make it difficult to get any of them back on the job site.\" The Forest Service put the remaining work up for bid, awar- ded it to another contractor and later released the funds it had been withholding to Rogers. The reactions of members of Travis Walton's family when they first were told that he had been \"zapped\" and abducted by a UFO provide a useful clue as to whether they really believed the story. If the family really believed that such an incident had oc- curred, they might never see Travis alive again. Several Navajo County law en- forcement officers had assembled late on the night of Nov. 5 and had returned to the \"UFO site\" with Rogers and several of his crew to search for Travis. Shortly after midnight/it was decided to inform Travis's mother who was then staying in a small house on the Gibson family ranch, not too far from where the incident allegedly had occurred. Rogers, who knew where Mrs. Kellet was staying, and Under-Sheriff Ken Coplan, of Holbrook, drove over to bring Mrs. Kellet the shocking news of the fate that seemingly had befallen Travis. On Nov. 6, a large search pany was organized to look for Travis, or his remains. Mrs. Kellet and Duane, who had arrived from Phoenix, joined the group. But ac- cording to Under-Sheriff Coplan, by late in the day it was Mrs. Kellet herself who suggested that the search be abandoned, ex- plaining: \"I just don't think"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"there's any use of looking any fur- ther... I.don't think he's on this earth.\"This was confirmed to me by Navajo County Sheriff Marlin .Gillespie, during our Mar. 15 in- terview. As members of the sear- ch party were preparing to leave the site, Duane announced that he would remain on, alone. Coplan said that Duane remarked that he would stay \"because they (UFOs) always bring them (victims) back to the same spot.\" This suggests that Duane had considerable knowledge of other alleged UFO abduction cases. Duane and Travis had had a very close relationship. Mrs. Kellet's two ill-fated marriages had left the family without a father and Duane told me that he had assumed that role. Even if Duane were correct that the UFO would bring Travis back, Travis might have been blinded or seriously burned from the intense beam of radiation that allegedly had zapped him — IF THE IN- CIDENT HAD REALLY OC- CURRED. Yet during the Nov. 8 taped in- terview with Fred Sylvanus — at a time when Travis was still \"missing\" — Duane was very calm and confident. At one point in the interview, Duane volun- teered: \"I don't believe he's hurt or injured in any way. He will be back sooner or later, whenever they . get done what they're doing.\" (Duane's calmness on Nov. 8 is in striking contrast to his legitimate concern .when Travis later returned in a confused state- of-mind, to be described shortly.) The Nov. 8 interview continued as follows: Sylvanus: \"You feel he will comeback?\" Walton: \"Sure do. Don't feel any fear for him at all. Little ' regret because I haven't been able to experience the same thing. That's about it.\" Sylvanus: \"You feel you just miss him and he'll come back?\" Walton: \"He's not even missing. He knows where he's at and I know where he's at.\" Sylvanus: \"You know where .he's at?\" Walton; \"Basically, he's not in the woods. They took him for whatever purpose they take people, to run a few tests.\" Sylvanus: \"Well, where do you feel he is?\" ' . Walton: \"Not on this earth!\". (Later in the interview) Sylvanus: \"You know that he's going to come back?\" Walton: \"Sure do. It's a matter of time. They don't kill people....\" •• Sylvanus: \"You feel that he'll befound?\" Walton: \"Yeah, he'll be found and if he doesn't come back, it'll be voluntary because he wanted to stay...\" The bulk of the Sylvanus in- terview was with Mike Rogers as he described events leading up to the alleged UFO incident. During the hour-long interview, Rogers described in great detail the con- struction details of the UFO, even commenting several times on its great beauty. Rogers described how Travis had been zapped by the intense beam from the UFO that allegedly sent him \"flying\" in the air with his arms out- stretched. BUT AT NO TIME DURING THE HOUR-LONG INTERVIEW DID ROGERS EXPRESS THE SLIGHTEST CONCERN OVER WHETHER TRAVIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN INJURED OR KILLED BY BEING ZAPPED, OR WHETHER HE WOULD EVER SEE HIS FRIEND AND ASSOCIATE ALIVE AGAIN! ONE POSSIBLE EX- PLANATION FOR THE REAC- TION OF ROGERS AND MEM- BERS OF THE FAMILY IS THAT THEY KNEW THAT THE IN- CIDENT WAS A HOAX AND THAT TRAVIS WAS SAFE IN A TERRESTRIAL HIDEOUT, RATHER THAN ABOARD AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL SPACE- CRAFT THAT MIGHT BE TAKING HIM TO A DISTANT WORLD FROM WHICH HE MIGHT NEVER RETURN. There is reason to believe that Travis Walton may not have followed the original \"game plan\" for the hoax. On the evening of the intial search party effort, on Nov. 6, Mrs. Kellet had urged that the search be abandoned on the grounds that Travis was \"not on this earth.\" The law enforcement officers, suspicious of a hoax, were not unhappy to comply with the request. ^ Two days later, on Saturday, Nov. 8, Duane told me that he drove to Holbrook to see Sheriff Gillespie whom he sharply criticized for failing to continue the search for Travis. (Recall that the search had been called off earlier at the suggestion >, of Travis's mother.) So another costly search effort was mounted on Sunday, Nov. 9, and it con- tinued on Nov. 10, being called off only a few hours before Travis reappeared. Also on Nov. 10, Rogers and five members of his crew went to Holbrook to take a polygraph test administered by C.E. Gilsbn. Shortly after midnight, Mrs. Grant Neff told me, she received a telephone call from Travis who said he was calling from a pay- phone booth in a gas station in Heber, approximately 30 miles west of Snowf lake and about 10-15 miles from where the UFO .in- cident allegedly occurred. Mrs. Neff said her husband drove \"to Mrs. Kellet's house to pick up Duane and the two men drove to Heber to pick up Travis. They brought him to Mrs. Kellet's house, then Mr. Neff returned home so his wife could drive to Mrs. Kellet's home to see her brother. During my Mar. 12 interview with Mrs. Neff, she told me that her husband said they had found PAGE 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Travis \"slumped in the bottom of the phone booth.\" Mrs. Neff used the following words to describe Travis's condition when she saw him that night: \"so shook-up, he was so upset...he was very panicky...even talking to us was a real strain. He was very upset.\" This is confirmed by other evidence that shows that Travis was barely aware of what was going on at the time of his telephone call. During a tape- recorded interview with the \"National Enquirer,\" several days after his return, Travis said: \"I rushed into the first phone booth I came to and called my mother.\" (Emphasis added.) There was no telephone either in Mrs. Kellet's home in Snowflake or in the house on the Gibson ran- ch in the mountains. Shortly after Travis called his sister, Sheriff Gillespie received a tip that a man claiming to be Travis Walton had called Mrs. Neff from a telephone booth in Heber. Gillespie called Sheriff's Deputy GJen Flake,.in Snowflake, asking him to get dressed and drive to the highway from Heber to watch for Travis. Flake did so but without success. So he decided to drive to Mrs. Kellet's house, arriving there around 2 a.m., he told me during our Mar. 12 in- terview. Flake said he found \"lights were on in the house and there was a fellow out in the yard siphoning gas out of a car.\" The officer got out to investigate and recognized the young man as Duane Walton. Duane explained that he had decided he had to return to Phoenix immediately to get back to his business but had forgotten to buy gas for the four- hour trip. So he was siphoning gas from his brother-in-law's car sin- ce there would be no gas stations open at that hour. Flake made no attempt to enter the Kellet house. Only two days earlier, Duane's criticism had prompted Navajo County officials to launch another PAGE 10 costly search effort to line 1 Travis. Yet now that Travis had been found, Duane did not \"tell Sheriff's Deputy Glen Falke ihar Travis had returned and was just inside the nearby house. ONE POSSIBLE EXPLANATION IS THAT DUANE DID NOT WANT ANYBODY OUTSIDE THE FAMILY, AND ESPECIALLY A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFI- CER, TO SEE TRAVIS IN HIS \"CONFUSED. 'STATE-OF-MIND. During my Api 23 tcfephont in- terview with Duane, 1 asked him why he had not informed Sheritf's Deputy Flake that Travis had returned. Duane replied: \"It was none of his damn business!\" Duane went on to explain that at that point his primary concern was for Travis's health and well- being, and that he wanted to get medical attention for his.brother. When I asked Dua.ie why he had driven all the way to Phoenix to get medical attention tor Travis, he explained: \"Showflake does not have a doctor, and as .o why I spirited him away to Phoenix in the middle of the night — because those narrow-minded, small-town red-necked people (in Snowflake are dangerous.... There's no doc- tor there and the reason I took him to Phoenix in the middle of the night was to get him medical assistance.\" Investigation showed -that Duane was correct about there not being a physician in Snowflake. However, only 16 miles south, in the town of Show Low, there is a physician named Dr. Garver who operates a medical clinic there. If speedy medical aid was Duane's prin- cipal concern, he did not have to drive all the way to Phoenix, unless Duane had a family doctor there in whom he had great con- fidence. When I asked about this possibility, Duane replied: \"No. Nobody in my family is sick, ever, very seldom.\" Polygraph examiner McCarthy told me that before he ran the test on Travis, he had first talked with Duane. During this discussion, McCarthy told me, Duane stressed what a fine young man Travis was and that he was NOT A DRUG USER. McCarthy told me: \"One of the things he (Duane) harped on was that when he found him (Travis) in Heber, the first thing he did when he got him home was to strip him naked and look all over his body. And he found a needle mark in his right elbow, and he (Duane) knows this is foreign because this boy has never used anything (i.e. drugs).\" But McCarthy said that when he later interviewed Travis that he contradicted his older brother's statement and that Travis ad- mitted to having used \"pot,\" \"speed,\" and LSD. The first person outside the Walton family to talk with Travis after he returned was Lester H. Steward, of Phoenix, a hypno- therapist and health-consultant. The meeting was arranged through William Spaulding, an of- ficial of Ground Saucer Watch (GSW), a UFO group that is sym- pathetic to the idea of ex- traterrestrial visitors in the form of UFOs. Duane and Spaulding had met during the time that Travis was \"missing\" and Spaulding had offered to provide assistance if Travis returned safely. According to Duane, he and his brother arrived in Phoenix shortly after 6 a.m. on Nov. 1-1. Duane called Spaulding who in turn called Steward around 7 a.m. Shortly afterward, Duane called Steward and arranged to visit him in his office at 9:30 p.m. In retrospect, it seems that Duane originally thought chat \"Dr. Steward\" was a physician who could give Travis a medical examination. Steward is not. He is a psychologist and hypnotist whose Ph.D. is from a small private school in Southern Califor-"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"nia. Soon after the Waltons arrived, Duane realized that Steward could not himself per- form a medical exam and he made it clear to Steward that Travis was not ready to undergo hypnosis. Steward agreed and called a friend, an M.D./psychiatrist, to ask him to try to arrange for extensive laboratory tests. But by the time the latter could make the necessary arrangements, the Waltons had decided to depart. In the course of the discussions in Steward's office, the Waltons learned that he had worked ex- tensively in the field of drug- addiction. When the Waltons first arrived, Stewart noted that Travis seemed dazed and con- fused. Travis sat silently holding his head in his hands, Steward told me in a telephone interview on Apr. 25, while Duane proceeded to tell in detail what allegedly had occurred to Travis aboard the UFO. At first, Steward told me, he had assumed that Travis's dazed condition was the result of his traumatic ex- periences aboard a UFO. But as the interview proceeded, .another possible explanation for Travis's condition occurred to Steward as a result of his own fir- st-hand experience with the with- drawal symptoms of drug-users. As time passed, Travis began to emerge from his confused and depressed state-of-mind. If his original condition had been the result of a traumatic experience aboard a UFO, it should have per- sisted for a much longer time, Steward concluded. More im- portant, Steward had observed the small puncture wound on the inside of Travis's right elbow. This prompted Steward to suspect that Travis might have in- jected LSD, perhaps in com- bination with an animal tranquilizer called PCP, Steward later told me. Although LSD usually is taken orally, when in- jected in combination with PCP it can have a very powerful hallucinatory effect. Steward told me that the effect would normally begin to wear off about 8-16 hours after being injected. At t: e time that Travis had arrived at Steward's office, it was about nine hours after he had called from the Heber telephone booth in a \"con- fused\" state-of-mind. It is not known whether Steward's growing suspicions of drug involvement were obvious to Duane, nor what effect Steward's mention of his experience in treating drug-addicts may have had in prompting the Waltons to terminate the interview after ap- proximately an hour-and-a- quarter in Steward's office. Later that same morning (Nov. 11), APRO officials made contact with Duane at his home. In response to his request for a medical exam for Travis, APRO called two physicians, both APRO members, to ask them to visit Duane's home and examine Travis. The two physicians, Dr. Howard Kandell and Dr. Joseph Salts arrived about 3 p.m., Dr. Kandell told me during our second telephone interview on April 25. Dr. Kandell said he brought along both a tape recorder and a camera, but Duane flatly refused to let him record the interview or take any pictures of Travis. Kan- dell told me that Duane \"asked me to limit my examination to just determine that he is alright and not to go into any details as to what had transpired (aboard the UFO.) It was hard to examine him without questioning him, and I did question him somewhat, although most of the information that I got at that time as to what (had) transpired was from the brother (Duane).\" (Emphasis ad- ded.) (Considering that Travis had been in such a \"confused\" state- of-mind when picked up in Heber and that he apparently remained in this dazed condition until late in the morning of Nov. 11, it is strange that Duane would have been able to acquire so many details by 3 p.m. of the same day as to what allegedly had happened aboard the UFO. And despite the fact that APRO officials were very sympathetic to the UFO ab- duction story, Duane was not yet ready to allow even APRO representatives to tape record Travis's story of the alleged in- cident. Dr. Kandell described to me Travis's condition on the af- ternoon of Nov. 11: \"He was lying there in bed with the shades drawn...looking . up at the ceiling...He really didn't show any emotion.:. He answered questions appropriately when spoken to but he wasn't very verbal...his at- titude was like a person who was disturbed, depressed.\" In respon- se to my question, Dr. Kandell acknowledged that he has had no first-hand experience with drug- addicts because he is a pediatrician. Dr. Kandell found no evidence of physical injury or burns, despite the claim that only six days earlier Travis had been \"zapped\" by a very intense beam from a UFO. However, Kandell told me that he did find a small puncture wound on the inside of Travis's right elbow. Dr. Kandellsaidthis small pun- cture was similar to what would be found if a blood sample had been taken. \"I came across this in the course of my examination and asked him if he knew how he got this, and he said 'no,' that he hadn't noticed it before.\" (This contradicts McCarthy's statement that Duane said he had spotted the mark shortly after Travis's return when Duane had him strip down.) Dr. Kandell said that the punc- ture mark was not directly over the large vein. When i asked him whether LSD injected into the PAGE 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"spot where the puncture mark was found could have caused a narcotic effect, he replied: \"Yes, because whether it is injected into a vein or under the skin anywhere, it is absorbed and would have its effect. Most people who take drugs usually inject it in- to the vein because you get an im- mediate effect. If you inject it into a muscle or under the skin, you get an effect but it is delayed.'' When I asked Dr. Kandell whether he had mentioned this puncture mark in the elbow in his official report to APRO, he replied: \"Yes, it was in my report.\" YET APRO HAS NEVER MENTIONED THIS TRAVIS WALTON PUNCTURE MARK IN ITS ARTICLES ON THE CASE. Instead, APRO has emphasized that there could not possibly be any drug involvement because an analysis of a urine sample, allegedly the first voided by Travis after his return, showed no evidence of drug use. I asked Dr. Kandell whether this \"first\" urine sample had been obtained in his presence so he could be certain that it had really come from Travis. Kandell replied: \"Duane gave me a jar and he said 'this is Travis's first voided specimen since he's been found.' All I have is his (Duane's) word for it.\" (GSW's Spaulding told me that prior to Travis's return, he had urged Duane to ob- tain an early urine specimen because there would be speculation that there might be drug involvement. If Travis's con- dition prompted Duane to believe there was drug-involvement, the urine specimen 1« gave Dr. Kan- dell could have come from Duane or his brother-in-law.) Dr. Kan- dell told me tb?t there is no possible way to determine if the original specimen really did come from Travis. Dr. Kandell commented on one curious aspect of the urine sample that Duane provided. This was the PAGE 12 lack of \"acetones\" in the urine. The physician explained that if a person has gone without nourish- ment for several days, his body begins to break down its own fat for survival. The waste-product of this process shows up as acetones in that person's urine. Despite the fact that Travis had been \"missing\" for more than five days, lab analysis of the \"first\" urine sample revealed NO acetones present. This means the urine sample came from a person who had not gone without nourish- ment for five days. It might be argued that the sam- ple did come from Travis and that he was fed aboard the UFO. But in his frequent tellings of his alleged experience, Travis never has mentioned being fed while he was \"conscious.\" It might then be claimed that perhaps while he was \"unconscious,\" he was fed in- travenously and this could then explain the puncture mark in his right elbow. But as Dr. Kandell noted, the wound is not over a large vein, which would rule out intravenous feeding. According to Steward, when LSD is injected, no traces of the drug can be found in blood, urine or saliva samples 10-24 hours af- ter injection. When the Waltons first came to Steward's office, Duane was extremely anxious that Travis undergo full lab tests. But by later that afternoon, when Dr. Kandell and Dr. Salts arrived, Duane only wanted a more casual physical check-up. It was not until the afternoon of Nov. 13, more than 48-hours after Travis's return, that he came to Dr. Kan- dell's office to give blood and urine samples for lab analysis. Lab tests of these samples showed no traces of illicit drugs. Not until Travis was in Phoenix, and outside the legal jurisdiction of Navajo County Law En- forcement officials who had been suspicious of a hoax from the start, did Duane notify the Navajo County Sheriff's office in Holbrook that his brother had returned. At first Duane said that Travis had been taken to an un- named hospital in Tucson for medical tests. Duane later ad- mitted this story was false and he said it was released to avoid the news media. (Yet within several days he and Travis willingly met with the \"National Encmirer.\") According to Sheriff Gillespie, it was not until late in the afternoon on Nov. 11 that Duane called to give a truthful report on Travis's whereabouts. During my Mar. 15 interview with Gillespie, the Sheriff told me he had said to Duane: \"I need to talk to Travis, and he said, 'well, Travis is not available.' And I said, Well, you need to make him available so I can talk to him.\" Duane finally agreed and Gillespie told me that he promptly drove to Phoenix, arriving late that night. Gillespie described his meeting with Travis as follows: \"When I first went into the house, he (Travis) was laying on a sofa in the living room...He appeared to be tired, spoke in a very low tone of voice. I talked to him for quite a while and asked him numerous questions, and had him relate his story to me.\" When I asked the Sheriff whether he had tape-recorded his interview with Travis, he replied: \"No. They had made an almost in- sistent request that there be nobody else around, and no recor- dings, or anything like that.\" (One possible reason for Duane's -insistence is that this would be the first time that Travis himself would have to tell of his alleged UFO experiences, rather than having Duane tell them. Travis had not had much time, since recovering from his \"confused\" state-of-mind, to master the story. Gillespie told me that he has since noted a number of changes in the Travis Walton story as he originally heard it and as it has"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"since been, reported in the news media.) Shortly after APRO made con- tact with the Walton brothers, it alerted the \"National Enquirer.\" The newspaper asked APRO to arrange the polygraph test and APRO called McCarthy. The newspaper also asked APRO to rent rooms at the Sheraton Hotel in Scottsdale to shield the Walton brothers from the rest of the news media. It was in the Sheraton where Travis flunked the lie-detector test given by Mc- Carthy. The Dec. 16,1975, edition of the \"National Enquirer\" ran a full- page feature on the Travis Walton case under the following banner headline: 5 Witnesses Pass Lie Test While Claiming ARIZONA MAN CAPTURED BY UFO There was no mention of the fact that the \"abductee\" himself had been questioned about the alleged experience by a'very ex- perienced polygraph examiner who had concluded that story was a hoax! On Feb. 21,1976, Travis Walton and APRO's L.J. Lorenzen were interviewed on an NBC-TV net- work program called \"The Unex- plained.\" The moderator (Leonard Nimoy), after men- tioning that APRO had carefully investigated the case, asked Mr. Lorenzen why he believed Travis Walton's story. Lorenzen replied: \"Well, he's truthful and doesn't use drugs. We had psychological testing carried out and it shows he has a normal psychological profile.\" (Apparently it is quite \"nor- mal\" to hope to be abducted by a UFO!!) The February, 1976, issue of \"The A.P.R.O. Bulletin,\" (mailed in late April), carried another story on the Travis Walton case which began: \"Pursuant to our policy of attempting to present as accurate information as possible to the membership, and because Travis Walton was kind enough to furnish exact information, we herewith correct some inac- curacies which appeared in our initial recounting of his ex- perience.\" These corrections included such minutia as: \"The dividers did not glow but were a dull silver color...the clothing of the creatures (aboard the UFO) was not brown but rather ah orangish- tan which Travis designates as a difficult color to describe...He was not taken into another craft, but rather out of the enclosure which Travis refers to as a 'hangar,' down a straight hallway to a small room...\" Dr. J. Allen Hynek...said he had interviewed Travis Walton and believes he is \"not hoaxing.\" He also said Walton had successfully taken a lie-detector test three weeks ago...\" \"He has been made the subject of a lot of unnecessary and un- founded accusations,\" Hynek said. \"There seems to be little support for the accusations made against him...\" \"I still don't know whether he was abducted in a nuts-and-bolts UFO,\" said Hynek in the in- terview. \"The case isn't open and shut.\" Hynek added that he would await hypnosis of Walton before reaching more definite con- clusions. NOT ALL UFO ORGANIZATIONS WERE SO GULLIBLE: William Spaulding, western director of Ground Saucer Watch (GSW), quickly became suspicious of the Walton story in the wake of the incident in Steward's office. By Nov. 15, both Spaulding and Steward had publicly denounced the case as a hoax. even though neither was aware of the then-secret Mc- Carthy lie-detector test. (I wish to express my appreciation to Spaulding for his considerable assistance in my investigation by providing a copy of the Nov. 8 taped interview and copies of local newspaper clippings on the incident which were most helpful. Although Spaulding and I But there was no mention of the Nov. 15, 1975, lie-detector test by. McCarthy that Travis Walton had flunked. Nor. was there any men- tion of the small puncture wound on his right elbow. The article concluded with the following ap- praisal: \"The Consulting and Ad- ministrative staffs of APRO feel that the Travis Walton case is one of the most important and in- triguing in the history of the UFO phenomena.\" (Emphasis added.)> IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT APRO IS THE OLDEST UFO ORGANIZATION IN THIS COUN- TRY AND THE LORENZENS ARE AMONG THE MOST EX- PERIENCED INVESTIGATORS OF UFO CASES.  : Another very experienced UFO investigator is Dr. J. Allen Hynek who has been active in the field for nearly 30 years and who now heads his own Center for UFO Studies. In late March, 1976, Hynek visited Arizona to conduct his own investigation of the Travis Walton case. He was interviewed by the press and the Associated Press released the following story: Phoenix (AP) — A leading national authority on unidentified flying objects said yesterday there is \"no substantiation\" for allegations of a hoax made again- st a young Arizonan who said he was abducted by a UFO last year. Disagree on the fun- damental UFO issue, we share the common view that hoaxes ought to be exposed and that failure to do so can only hurt the \"UFO Movement.\") NICAP (National In- vestigations Committee on Aerial PAGE 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Phenomena), in its first report on the Travis Walton case to its members, said there was cause for suspicion that the case might be a hoax. *** The March 1976 issue of \"The A.P.R.O. Bulletin\" contained another article on the Walton case, reporting that Mrs. Kellet had taken and passed a polygraph examination given by Pfeifer, who had earlier passed Travis and Duane Walton. The article concludes by suggesting that \"individuals whose testimony conflicts with that of Mrs. Kellet, Travis and Duane Walton, as well as the six individual witnesses, should volunteer, as the foregoing have, to submit to a polygraph test to determine their roles in this case. Those individuals include Sheriff Gillespie, Stanford Flake,- Ken Copland, Bill Spaulding, Lester Steward and Phillip (sic) Klass. APRO will be happy to underwrite the cost of these tests and only await the acquiescence of the par- ticipants.\" On June 9, the day after receiving the March issue, I wrote to Mr. & Mrs. L.J. Lorenzen ; After expressing regrets at news of Mr. Lorenzen's recent surgery, and citing the above challenge, I wrote: \"I hasten to accept this offer, subject only to the following con- dition: that my test be given by a licensed polygraph examiner with at least 10 years experience—to assure his competence. Otherwise I leave the choice of the examiner in your hands. I shall be delighted to take the test in Washington D.C. area or in Phoenix if APRO will underwrite my travel ex- penses, whichever you prefer. \"I ask, but do NOT .set-as a con- dition to my test, that Jim Loreri- zen also agree to take a polygraph examination to be given by a licensed examiner with 10 or more years experience.

He would be my choice to administer Jim's test as soon as his health permits. \"I trust that your acceptance will be as mine and that APRO will publish this brief letter in \"The APRO Bulletin\" so mem- bers can be informed of my prom- pt acceptance and of my own challenge.\" Sincerely, (signed) Philip J.

It has come to light in a very round- about way. The witness, who remains anonymous, reported the experience to police; a policeman described the case on television and it was published in the Jyllan- ds Posten (February 25, 1975) with the headline \"Car Stopped by Flying Saucer.\" UFO-Aspekt reprinted the story, along with others, in its April 1975 edition. That edition included a drawing of a humanoid illustrating an ar- ticle, and for that reason it was sent to Rich Heiden who has ac- cess to a translation service. Using his own judgment, Rich figured out that the article was a rehash of humanoid reports so, in- stead, arranged for translation of this physical evidence case. WESTERN ZEALAND, DENMARK FEBRUARY 19,1975 The incident occurred during a period of increased UFO activity, according to UFO-Aspekt. Mrs X had just driven her daughter to Ryslinge High School and was returning to Orbak when the engine and all other electrical equipment on her car ceased func- tioning at 19:19 (presumably 7:19 PM). She allowed her car to roll to the curb and stopped. At the same moment, a very large circular ob- ject descended above the car from behind. A brilliant bluish luminescence was emitted from the object unlike any light she had ever seen. Shortly afterward the light and the object vanished. JUTLAND, DENMARK MAY 2, 1975 Physiological Effects For a while the heat in the car became unbearable, and she felt a \"prickly sensation\" on her face. After the UFO disappeared, the car started with no problem. Next day she felt restless and sick with nausea. Mrs. X told the newspaper that when she went outdoors in the open, her face ached; she had never had this problem before. The car, a red Volkswagen, had a number of blue stripes on the roof which were not there before the ex- perience (photograph of stripes reproduced in UFO-Aspekt). ; Editorial Note: The case was known to Danish UFO in- vestigators within a week. It is not clear whether Mrs X consulted a doctor and any medical reports are available, or whether any tests or inspection .were made of the car. Chemical tests of the discolored paint should have been possible, and Mrs X should have been advised to undergo medical examination. TRANSLATORS NEEDED , The chance way in which the Danish physical evidence case came to light illustrates^ttie need for MUFON members with foreign language skills to offer, their services. Particularly needed are journal reviewers to scan foreign journals, translating only significant cases (humanoid reports; physical, physiological, and E-M effects; landings; etc.) Journals are available in French, Spanish, Portuguese, Scan: dinavian languages, and Japanese.

For sometime there have been confusing stories of inhabitants from beyond who, without previous warning, decide to visit us. More frequently, we know of flights of UFO's, without the little men being seen. Until now, when those from other inhabited worlds appeared on our planet, the thing did riot go past a quick exhibition. But this last demonstration of living beings from the cosmos leaves us astonished. And if it leaves us astonished, I would not want to say how it left Miguel Fernandez Carrasco, 24 year old, a native of Benacazon and a laborer by trade, residing in the aforementioned village, street General Franco number 81. His odyssey is also worth the poetry (like Homer). The night before last, at mid- nite, Miguel Fernandez was retur- ning from Sanlucar la Mayor to Benacazon. He had been visiting his girlfriend Carmen Alvarado Saeno. He was walking along singing to himself to make the time pass quicker; when not singing, then thinking of his girlfriend. It was about 12:30 a.m. .(probably 00:30 hrs.) and there was a lover's moon which was good to look at. Suddenly... \"The deuce!\" It was not Satan, no. Miguel saw something like a large star and moving. He continued along his way and... \"What on earth!\" Again the star made a pass, this time very close, and disappeared. Uneasy, Miguel began to hurry. Yesterday, when we saw him, Miguel Fernandez Carrasco was PAGE 16 in the room of the Milagrosa of the Hospital of San Lazaro, bed num- ber 28. And thanks to the kindness of the doctor on duty, Dr. Moreno Alba, we were able to talk with Miguel about the event. \"When did the star come back for a third time?\" \"A quarter of an hour after the second pass. It came and it landed on the ground about two meters from me.\" \"It, of course, scared you.\" Miguel's face shows the fear he felt. He does not say much but gets a lump in his throat and shivers. \"I stopped\", he says, \"and two men came out of this thing. Their clothes looked like a frog-man's, with a wide belt with a buckle and in the center a little light that ap- peared to me like a sort of pilot light. The two men began to speak and I did not understand them.\" As there was no one to interpret, Miguel began to run. Fortunately, his blood, which had seemed frozen before began to circulate normally and he could run. In fact it was not just running. He ran faster than the wind.  : \"I heard the noise of powerful motors and, looking back, I saw that the UFO was above me, giving off something which bur- ned me and I immediately lost consciousness. When I came to I was lying in the door of my house, which was wide open, where my sister and brother found me.

This did not stop our hero from taking a pencil and sket- ching the shape of the UFO for us. Dr. Jorge Troano, to whom Miguel was sent for an examination told us: \"I inspected him from a neurological point of view, having found him totally normal, apart from his great excitement. He seems very nervous, for which I treated him.\" A rare case, very rare.... Miguel, among other things, told us that UFO's are seen frequently in Benacazon, and that his friends Diego and Manuel Suarez have seen them more than once. Before putting an end to this story, we telephoned Mr. Enrique Lopez Guerrero, parson of Mairena del Alcor. Mr. Enrique, who on certain occasions has of- fered us the opportunity to write a exciting report, is something of an advisor concerning UFO's, our spatial advisor. \"The whole zone of Baja An- dalucia,\" says Mr. Enrique, \"is the site of frequent appearances of UFO's. But, I have investigated many cases and never have the crews shown hostile actions.\" \"How do you explain the hap- pening?\" \"There is a certain type of UFO, which is seen very rarely, which, when taking off produces a deafening noise and explosions. This makes me think the UFO produced the effect on taking off.\" One thing is sure and that is, that in bed number 28 in the room of the Milagrosa in the Hospital of San Lazaro is occupied by a man who says he was a victim of some type of extraterrestrials. INTERNATIONAL DATA EXCHANGE PROGRAM UNDERWAY by Richard Hall A system of expediting ex- change of UFO data between MUFON and UFO groups around the world was inaugurated in March 1976. The keys to the suc- cess of the program are six MUFON Information Centers overseas where individuals with access to photo-copying equip- ment have agreed to duplicate and distribute reports, clippings, and other data to UFO resear- chers in their areas. (Copyrighted materials will be archived for library reference). In return, the centers have agreed to channel case reports of certain types (humanoid reports, E-M effects, physical evidence, etc.) to MUFON specialists whose names and addresses have been supplied to them: the recipients should summarize information received for Mufon UFO Journal. It is important for all sup- porters of MUFON and of in- ternational cooperation—especia- lly the MUFON specialists, and Regional and State Directors—to forward all possible information to these Centers; individual case studies, summary reports, monographs, books, newspaper clippings, articles, etc. Valuable information is already flowing in the other direction, so let's do our part to improve information ex- change.

To my way of thinking, this is a very positive step in the right direction, as we have seen what Dennis has done, not only with this JOUR- NAL, but with his former publication, UFOLOGY (to be edited in the future by Bruce A. PAGE 18 Schaffenberger). At this writing, an OFFICIAL UFO Collector's Edition is available on the newsstands for $2.50. It consists of reprinted articles from the first four issues of OFFICIAL UFO and will be of particular interest and value to those who may have missed these issues when they originally appeared. Also in- cluded are some beautiful UFO photos in color on the covers of the magazine. The November issue of OFFICIAL UFO should be available shortly. The October issue of UFO REPORT should be out in mid- September. ARGOSY UFO is now being published on a bi-monthly basis also, but the most recent issue contained only reprints from various books and back issues of ARGOSY. The Fall .issue of UFOLOGY is now on the stands and features interesting material, as always. TRUE FLYING SAUCERS AND UFO REPORTS is a quarterly publication which has contained relatively little of interest in the three issues published thus far. ANCIENT ASTRONAUTS is published on a bi-monthly basis and usually has a number of interesting articles. Publisher Ray Palmer will soon combine his two newsstand magazines, FLYING SAUCERS and SEARCH. The new publication (still named SEAR- CH) will also be available by sub- scription at $5.00 per year. It will be published bi-monthly. UFO books continue to appear in the bookstores regularly. Some of the more recent paperbacks have included: GODS OF AIR AND DARKNESS by Richard E. Mooney (Fawcett; $1.75) — THE ZARKON PRINCIPLE by Zarkon (Signet; $1.75) - UFO TREK by Warren Smith (Zebra; $1.75) — CETI (Communication with Ex- tra-Terrestrial Intelligence) by Jack Stonely & A.T. Lawton (War- ner; $1.50) - THE UFONAUTS by Hans Holzer (Fawcett; $1.75) Recent hardcovers will be cover- ed in the next column. 1976 MUFON SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS \"Swamp Gas Plus Ten - And Counting\" by 'Dr. J.

No. information about follow-up investigations is available for these cases, which are presented in chronological or- der: September 5, 1975; Itaperuna, Rio de Janeiro State. The ANSA news service reported that three students, 18 to 21 years old, claimed to have been \"harassed\" by a UFO while returning home from school by bicycle at 10 PM. A farmer reportedly witnessed the incident, and another witness photographed the UFO (the photograph shows a luminous cir- cle in the starry sky). The studen- ts saw \"a great luminosity, followed by strange objects in grazing flight.\" They jumped off their bicycles and took refuge un- der a nearby bridge. Farmer Boechat Buri heard their shouts and went to their aid, also seeing the strange luminosity. (Source: Unknown newspaper which refers to a previous account in \"Ultima Hora,\" Rio de Janeiro, which published the photograph). December 17,1975; Americana, Sao Paulo State. Sergio Salles de Andrade, 16, claims, \"I was kid- napped by a flying saucer.\" This is the only explanation he has for what happened to him on the night of December 17. While returning from his sister's house he en- countered \"an intense light which he could not escape from.\" He woke up next day in a dense thicket in Limeira, 28 kilometers from Americana. When he recovered consciousness, Sergio was very tired and the short jacket he was wearing the night before was missing. A deputy policeman, not indicating any by Richard Hall, MUFON international Coordinator belief in his story, gave him money for train fare home. Sergio had three mysterious spots on his body, one on the forehead and the other two on his forearms. Upon returning home he felt ill and was hospitalized. Af- ter rigorous tests, including an en- cephalogram, he was released in good health. Since then he gets a headache whenever he tries to recall what happened to him that night. He is considered by his friends to be an intelligent boy, and he has recently started work as a file clerk at a local firm where he passed the tests with distinction. Since release from the hospital, Sergio's headaches and the marks on his body have increased.

The farmer explained to the doctors that a strange object flew over the (area) at 10:00 PM. The Ceara authorities declined to comment on the event. However, it is known that an identical phenomenon was recorded in the city of Ipu, in the north of Ceara, on Carnival Sunday.\" (Source: Folha da Manha, Porto Alegre, 3/25/76). March 11, 1976; Jurema. Per- nambuco State. \"In the early morning....a 'flying saucer' flew over the soccer field of the city of Jurema....for 10 minutes. The strange craft emitted a bright orange light and the first people who saw the object were terrified. Mayor Epitacio Mendonca was also frightened and he tried to calm the people. Some believed that extraterrestrial beings were trying to come down, but in front of the curious it preferred to stay at a height of about 100 meters. Afterwards, turning toward the west, it disappeared at incredible speed.\" (Source: Diario da Regiao, Sao Jose do Rio Preto, 3/13/76). March 30,1976; Quixada, Ceara State. Student Francisca Roseti da Silva, 23, is quoted as saying: \"When I looked at the light I was completely blinded, and when trying to run I didn't have any strength. But even that way, staggering, I could succeed in returning to the yard of my house.\" While en route to school she saw a luminous object that followed and \"harrassed\" her with strong rays of light. She was hospitalized with burns and a \"bad state of nerves.\" Students of the Tiro de Guerra in Quixada also reported having seen a luminous object in the sky. (Sour- ce: Correio do Povo, Porto Alegre,4/1/76). April 7, 1976; Sao Paulo. About 10 PM an enormous \"flying saucer\" was observed hovering in the back yard at a height of about three meters by Genival Fer- nandes, a \"laborer.\" All the neighbors also saw the UFO, which was floating just above the ground and emitting rays of colored light. Police were called, and the witnesses waited to see how the police would react. An \"antenna\", protruding from an aperture in the UFO, turned con- tinuously. Before the police arrived, the UFO began to rotate rapidly and to emit stronger rays of light, then it rose at incredible speed and disappeared in space. The police arrived immediately afterwards, but did not see the UFO. (Source: O Dia, Rio de Janeiro, 4/8/76).

Joseph Gurney with artwork by Larry Hanna, is a tribute to the dedication of these two men in their efforts to educate the public to the UFO phenomenon and share the text of the speeches delivered or submitted with UFOlogists around the World. Joe has edited each of the MUFON Symposium Proceedings since 1971, except for 1974. I would like to express my appreciation to all of the subscribers to THE MUFON UFO JOURNAL who so patiently waited for the June, July, and August issues of the Journal, which were delayed due to the transfer of the files and addressing machine from Quincy, Illinois to Seguin, Texas. Starting with the September issue, we will be back on schedule. Thank you for being so considerate. Several sincere bids for hosting the future annual MUFON UFO Symposiums were made at the Annual MUFON Corporate Meeting in Ann Arbor, Mich, on July 13th. An active and well organized local UFO group is one of the prime requirements for submitting a bid. Consideration is then given to the section of the United States or Canada where the host group is located in such a manner that the site will geographically move into a different region each year. We are pleased to announce that the 1977 MUFON Symposium will be held in Phoenix, Arizona in July 1977 and will be hosted by GSW (Ground Saucer Watch) and MUFON/Arizona. William H. Spaulding is Director of GSW- Western Division and MUFON State Director for Arizona. They have an outstanding team of UFO investigators and researchers in Arizona. The exact date and facilities contracted will be given in a future issue of the JOURNAL. Dayton, Ohio was selected as the site for the 1978 MUFON UFO Symposium. This bid was made by Richard Hoffman, Leonard Stringfield, Charles Wilhelm and associates. The locale would thus be the former home of Project Blue Book, Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson AFB. Inquiries have already been made by two other groups to sponsor the 1979 and 1980 symposiums, which attests to the reputation MUFON has established as an international leader in this field. Elmer Krai, State Director for Nebraska, has appointed Gary Evans, Box 244, Crofton, Nebi. 68730 as State Section Director for Knox and Cedar counties. James P. Barrett, 130 Ballard Drive, West Hartford, Conn. 06119; telephone: 203/233-7365 is the new State Section Director for Hartford, Middlesex and Tolland counties. He was recommended by Frederick Kolbe, State Section Director in Darien, Conn. Thomas F. Maoris, 1245 Cherry Ave., San Jose, CA 95125 has volunteered his services and talent as a cartoonist/illustrator to the JOURNAL and for future editions of the MUFON UFO Proceedings. Tom has his B.A. in Public Service and is a Police Training Officer. He was recommended by Paul Cerny, Western Regional Director. The new Editor of OFFICIAL UFO, succeeding Bernard O'Connor and Dr. Russ A. Rueger, is D. William Hauck, currently Editor of THE MUFON UFO JOURNAL. Dennis will continue editing the MUFON JOURNAL, but he is relinguishing the editorship of UFOLOGY to selected colleagues. Richard H. Hall and Mark Chesny have assumed the duties of Associate Editors for the JOURNAL, thereby giving Dennis very competent assistance. No other UFO publication in the World has a Staff comparable to the talent and experience that exists on the JOURNAL Team. MUFON visitors to Seguin, Texas in August were Ed and Mildred Higgins, Fayetteville, Ark.; Jack and Mary Cortright, Victoria, TX; Grover and Dianna Mackenroth, Port Lavaca, TX; John and Kathy Schuessler, Houston, TX; James McCampbell, Belmont, CA; and Don and Mary Lynn Andrus, Harrisburg, IL. Mrs. Janice Bernard is MUFON's new office secretary. Mrs. Jackie Gross will continue to help as her personal tune permits. Processing JOURNAL subscriptions and mailing the JOURNAL from Seguin has added to the work load performed. Volunteers will assist during the monthly mailings of our magazine. John M. Lucas, Publisher of Blueapple Books, P.O. Box 5694, Austin, TX 78763, has announced that Ray Stanford's new book \"Socorro Saucer in a Pentagon Pantry\" will be officially released on September 15th. Ray is Director of Project Starlight International and a MUFON State Section Director. This hardback book provides some insights into the Socorro, New Mexico landing that have not previously been known and demonstrate the thoroughness of Ray Stanford as a Field Investigator. Mark R. Herbstritt stronomy Notes AUGUST MERCURY- Greatest western elongation is on the 7th, and will be a favorable one. Un- til mid-month, Mercury will be easily found near the eastern horizon just before sunrise. VENUS - It is about 10 degrees above the southwest, horizon at sunset and sets about an hour later. MARS - It is too close to the sun for easy observation. JUPITER - In Taurus it rises about two hours after sunset. SATURN - In Cancer it rises about mid- night. The ORIONID METEOR SHOWER occurs October 18 and 23."}]
