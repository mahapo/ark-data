Leir T he waning of winter in Southern California brought with it a hotbed of activity of unidentified aerial phenomena, particularly, in the small Ventura County suburb of Camarillo. Reports of unidentified flying objects started pouring into our new MUFON of- fice located in Newbury Park. This oc- curred all during the month of November 1996. One aggregate of sightings persisted. This resulted in what I consider one of the most indepth research efforts put forth by any group on record. Ventura-Santa Barbara MUFON in conjunction with The Fund for Interactive Research in Space Technology made a collaborative effort to describe and define the nature of these sightings. The Beginning On November 29th, one day after Thanksgiving Day, a telephone call was logged into the MUFON office requesting investigation of a UFO sighting. The fam- ily reporting the sighting lived in Camarillo, California, where they owned a horse ranch, one of several such ranches of the same type located close in to the urban portion of the city. It was a hilltop sight with a good view of the surrounding area. A view of the sky from the rear portion of the ranch house allowed for good visual- ization of the northern, eastern and western sky. They reported their first visualization to be about 4:30pm on Thanksgiving Day, November the 28th. At this time the family was in the process of feeding horses and was out in the corral area. The sun was in the process of setting in the southwestern sky. They noticed a very bright object about 70 to 80 degrees above the north- western horizon. They were surprised to see something there because it was not yet dark enough to see the stars or other celes- tial objects. Another thing that caught their eye was the extreme brightness of the ob- ject. They reported to our MUFON investiga- tor, Mary Helen Corrado, that the event lasted for approximately 30 minutes, dur- ing which time the object was seen to slowly move in a path from the northwest toward the southeast. They reported that they did not think it was any type of air- craft they had seen before, although they could not make out any definitive shape. The event was witnessed by the husband, wife and daughter. They also reported that the object was seen on the next three con- secutive days at approximately the same time of day. In addition they reported that the object exhibited a peculiar behavior and seemed to alter its shape and eject other objects which they described as less intense in brightness than the original ob- ject. On the morning of December the 2nd, our office was sent an E-Mail by the re- porting family and our investigator, Mary Helen, was dispatched to the sight. She ar- rived at 4:30pm and reported the follow- ing: The winds were calm and out of the west, the sky was clear with unlimited visi- bility, there were no clouds. The number of witnesses were four. At exactly 4:55pm, a bright ball of light was seen in the northern sky. It was visible over the rooftop of the ranch house and above a tall oak tree. It was estimated to be 45-50 degrees up in the sky. The object could be seen with the naked eye and first appeared as a pin-point of bright light ob- served to be about the size of a small printed \"o\". There was a distinct absence of twin- kling. After viewing the object for a few minutes, it was determined that it was moving in a direction either higher in the sky or closer to the viewing area. The light was pure white in color. Next the object was viewed through high quality binocu- lars (16x50). It appeared even brighter and again did not seem to have the twinkling effect of a star produced by normal atmos- pheric distortion. It appeared to be self-il- Dr. Leir's last article here was \"In Search of Hard Evi- dence,\" which appeared in the April 1996 issue of the Journal.

At the same time it appeared to be moving in a downward di- rection. Now another small unknown seemed to come from the left side of the original ob- ject. February 1997 Number 346 Page 4 luminating and spheroid in shape. The set- ting sun produced a reddish hue in the sky. Conventional aircraft were seen to pass through the field of vision and reflect the sun in the normal manner. There was no reflective element observed in the un- known object. The object was seen to me- ander slowly across the sky. The speed at this point was difficult to determine. At about 5:10pm the object changed color. As seen through the binoculars it ap- peared to take on a ruddy, peach-colored hue. The next thing seen was another small pin-point object of the same color which seemed to be heading below and to the left of the original object. It was also estimated to be the size of a small letter \"o\". The ob- jects then separated and moved apart so they could not be seen in the same field of vision with the binoculars. The smaller ob- ject could not be seen with the naked eye. The original object began to change color to a more duskier hue. Next, small round puffs, which looked like smoke, were exuded from the top of the original object. At the same time it ap- peared to be moving in a downward direc- tion. Now another small unknown seemed to come from the left side of the original object. It was smaller than the first but round in shape, again, like the letter \"o\". Next the two objects moyed together in se- quence in an upward direction and disap- peared in what looked like a puff of smoke or mist. During the time of observation there was no noted sound. At the time of resolution the objects appeared to be ap- proximately 70 to 75 degrees up in the sky. The appropriate MUFON documenta- tion was filled out and filed in the Ventura MUFON office. A plan^was set into motion to visit the sight again in hopes the object would show itself. This time there would be adequate equipment for recording the sighting. The following day, December 3rd, 1996, several members of our group went to the Camarillo ranch site. The winds were calm. No measured ceiling. There were a few high cumulus clouds. The visibility was unlimited. Witnesses numbered eight. The object was first sighted by a mem- ber of our team at 4:36pm. At this time we started recording the sighting on video and still cameras, both with and without a tele- photo lenses. The object first appeared, as it did the previous night, as a pin-point area of very bright light. In contrast, how- ever, to the previous sighting the object ap- peared brighter, larger and possibly closer. It moved across the sky in the same man- ner. With the still cameras clicking off pic- tures and the video rolling, we continued to make our observations through binoculars. During the time of observation, the object appeared bright white in color and spher- oid in shape. Since a tripod was not avail- able, the cameras were hand held. At approximately 5:09pm, the object be- gan to take on a reddish hue. This was in- dependently reported by several of our trained observers. Shortly afterwards, this color changed again. The witnesses who were viewing the object through binoculars stated that a single, tiny bright object was emitted from the top portion and moved to its left away from its point of origin. This episode was visible for about 20 seconds and was not seen through the view finder of the video camera. Within a few seconds following the birth of the second object, the parent seemed to undergo a transforma- tion. It became dull and appeared to smear into a line of several smaller objects, all aligned in a vertical manner. Next they all appeared to split off from each other and vanish. This observation ended at 5:llpm. The apparent dissolution of the object with its vertical component was captured on video. D uring the next few days the weather deteriorated and no further encounters were noted. On Christmas Day, we re- ceived a big surprise, when our investiga- tor, Mary Helen, was notified by the family that the object had appeared on Christmas Eve. The time reported was 4:45pm. The family continued to take pictures of the ob- ject with their 35mm still camera. The fol- lowing night there was no sighting but on Friday and also on Saturday the object was sighted again. The Saturday sighting oc- curred on December 28th and was attended by several MUFON members and the au- thor. The winds were calm and the tempera- ture dropped to the high 40s. The visibility was unlimited. There were only a few dis- persed cumulus clouds. There was no mea- sured ceiling. Witnesses numbered nine. At 4:30pm, our MUFON team and the family gathered to possibly witness the continuation of this event. This time we were fully prepared. I brought my 8mm camcorder. In addition one of our other"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL members supplied a VHS camcorder. We had a myriad of still cameras with and without telephoto apparatus. In addition there was an adequate supply of binocu- lars. A thought occurred to me, that be- cause we were so well prepared, the object would probably not show. We anxiously waited and the minutes seemed like hours. We were almost ready to give up when one of the family members shouted, \"There it is!\" All eyes shot upwards, gazing at the sky and trying to follow the directions given by the primary observer. I am sorry to say that I was probably the last to visu- alize the object. I looked at my watch and the time was exactly 4:50pm. The sky was darker than on the previous nights. I first saw the object at about 85 de- grees off the visible horizon. It appeared as a pin-point, bright light. Next I visualized the object through the binoculars and it ap- peared to be round in shape with some sort of a darker area on the right side. It was traveling from the northwest toward the southeast. I estimated the luminosity to be between a minus 3 and 4 on a astronomical scale. In contrast I witnessed a number of high flying small and large commercial air- craft passing through the area and would value their reflected light emissions at about a 1 on the same scale. We observed the object for about 6 minutes as it traveled across the sky and just faded away. We were disappointed it did not last longer and decided to take the video into the house to see what we had captured. The temperature was dropping rapidly out- side and the warmth of the indoors felt good. After about fifteen minutes I had to make a trip out to the car to pick up an- other piece of electronic apparatus needed to show the video. One of the witnesses decided to go with me and turned on the outside light. It was getting dark and the property had numerous chuck holes that could not be seen in the shadows. I started my trek to the car and suddenly I heard a voice behind me yelling, \"Wow! Look at that! The doggone thing is back!\" I turned and ran back to where he was standing and took a gander at the sky where he was pointing. Much to my surprise, I found myself looking at the same bright object I had seen earlier. Fortunately I had the binoculars around my neck and quickly fo- cused them. Everyone inside heard the commotion and were soon outdoors, all set for further observation and filming. This time we watched it for about ten minutes. It was seen to emit another smaller object and then proceeded to form a straight verti- cal line before disappearing from view. The next few days were fraught with in- clement weather, so no attempts were made to view the object until January the 5th and 6th. We were well prepared for its return on those dates and armed ourselves with an astronomical telescope equipped with a thirteen-inch mirror and a camera mount. Unfortunately the object was a no show. Additional Area Sightings Ventura County and Santa Barbara Counties, California, have been a hotbed of sightings over the past two months. November 28th 1996 was the date re- ported by one our very own MUFON members, Mr. John Epperson, for an addi- tional unusual sighting. The detail of the investigation was performed by his wife Kathy, who is an officer on the MUFON local board. John was driving east on highway 126. The time was 6:15pm. He was on his way to visit his parents in the central valley. He reported the traffic as light and the weather clear. He was on the road for almost one hour when at about 7:15pm he noticed an orange-yellow light in his side vision mir- ror and thought that there must be a fire on the hillside to his right. Soon afterward he noticed several vehicles pulled off to one side of the road. He assumed they were parked to watch the fire and noticed that the occupants were all outside of their ve- hicles and pointing to a spot on the hill- side. He pulled off the road and parked be- hind them. John took a pair of binoculars from his glovebox and got out of the car. He noticed that one of the parked vehicles was a U.S. Postal truck. Evidently the dri- ver was one of the individuals standing be- side the road. He noticed another man standing there that seemed to be dressed in a peculiar fashion. He was wearing black pants, a white short sleeve shirt and a Fedora hat. He was also wearing half glasses of the reading type. John thought that this was strange because the man was not reading anything. Looking through the binoculars John noticed that the glow was not a fire but ap- peared as a orange-yellow ball of light. He viewed the object for 15 minutes during Much to my surprise, I found myself looking at the same bright object I had seen earlier... It was seen to emit another smaller object and then pro- ceeded to form a straight verti- cal line before disappearing from view.

February 1997 Number 346 Page 6 which time it grew to about 1 and 1/2 times its original size and then just blinked out. Before that, he noticed, the color changed from orange to red and showed a bit of white. It appeared to be spade- shaped. He also noted that it revolved, was completely silent and cast no shadow. The place of the sighting was open country, be- tween two hills, about 1/4 mile from the top of a mountain in an area of rolling hills covered with orange trees. It was approxi- mately 6 miles from the Los Angeles County line. John struck up a conversation with a lady by the name of Helen. They discussed the subject of UFOs for a few minutes be- fore she departed. He invited her to attend a MUFON meeting and she seemed inter- ested in doing so. With that the observers made a hasty de- parture. The postal truck driver remarked that he was going to report this episode to the sheriff's department and was in a hurry to get back on the road. He also stated that he had been watching the object since 7:00pm. It seemed as if all the observers were nervous and apparently wanted to leave that spot in a hurry. John then proceeded to his vehicle, got in and started the engine. He noticed that the car clock indicated 8:00pm. This dis- agreed with his watch which indicated only 7:40pm. He was stunned as the watch was new; expensive and an accurate time piece. John, pondered the question of whether or not he had missing time, and if that was true, what about the other individuals? The investigation is still ongoing on this case and I will follow up with an additional article in the future if the case is meritori- ous. In Carpinteria, a small town just south of Santa Barbara, a man who was jogging witnessed a large, white object which sud- denly appeared over the mountains. He stated to our investigator that it slowly made its way down the slope of the hills and out over the Santa Barbara Channel. He described it \"as big as a house.\" Simi Valley, California, which is in the east central area of Ventura County was the scene of another sighting. On December the 12th at about 3:30pm, a female resident of that area reported seeing an object trav- eling overhead at an amazing speed. It was heading toward the southwest in the direc- tion of the Malibu area. This sighting was also corroborated by two other witnesses. In the E-mail message to MUFON, the wit- ness stated that the object streaked across the sky and then rapidly slowed to a com- plete stop. After maintaining its position for only a few seconds, it went straight up and began a series of zigzag type maneu- vers. It then shot off at a rapid rate of speed toward the northeast. The witness stated she saw the sunlight reflecting off the bottom of the craft which appeared slightly flattened and egg-shaped. The craft was completely silent and left no contrail. She stated that other conventional high fly- ing aircraft she witnessed all had some sort of contrails following them. On December 18th, at 5:53pm, a couple in Santa Barbara witnessed a bright white object drifting eastward from a location about 50 degrees south. They estimated its altitude at between 30 to 60,000 feet. At about ten or fifteen minutes past sunset they noticed that the brightness of the ob- ject faded and it became no more than a dot in the clear, darkening sky. They con- tinued to watch it as it began to emit a short, linear, cloud-like trail without a de- fined end. The trail did not appear as a nor- mal contrail. Suddenly it just vanished from view. In contrast to this type of sighting is a report generated from a man who resides in the Santa Monica Mountains. On December 6th, he was standing in his yard when a large, black triangular object passed silently overhead. He stated that it was as big as two football fields. It ap- peared to be thick and lighted around its external periphery with red, green and smaller dim, white lights. The man did not have a camera but since he had creative talent he was able to make a painting of the object. One week after this sighting, December 13th, a couple was watching a meteorite shower from a local school playground in Carpinteria, when they saw a large, thick, black triangle outlined with dim white lights around the edges. They told Don Robertson, a Ventura Santa Barbara MU- FON member and local reporter for the Coastal View newspaper, that the object was silent except it made a sound like the wind blowing by you when you are riding a bike. They also compared the sound to a large night bird flying overhead. When told about the painting the gentleman had made of the object he saw, the lady reached into a hutch and pulled out a pad with a sketch"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL of the triangle that a friend of hers had drawn after he viewed it through binocu- lars. They were identical. On the evening of December the 13th, another Carpinteria resident was out on the bluff area. He reported a dark Manta Ray- shaped object that passed silently over- head. This gentleman tried to visually fol- low the object but it vanished as suddenly as it appeared. The Investigation Ventura-Santa Barbara MUFON, work- ing in conjunction with The Fund for Interactive Research in Space Technology, ( F. I. R. S. T. ) began an indepth scientific investigation of the Camarillo sightings. All data was correlated and logged in a manner that could be replicated at a later date, using prescribed scientific protocols. The photographic equipment used con- sisted of the following: Camera 1 was a Konica Autoreflex Ex T4 35mm still camera, using a Ligor C/D Auto Teleconverter. The zoom capabilities were from 150mm to 520mm. The lens opening used was F5 and the shutter speed varied from 1/8, 1/4, and 1/2 to 1 second. The film used was Kodak Gold, ASA 100. Camera 2 was a Nikon model N2020, equipped with an AF Nikkor 28-85mm Zoom. All camera settings were set in the auto position with the exception of the fo- cus which was set to manual and the zoom at maximum distance. The film used was Kodak Gold ASA 400. Camera 3 was a Sony Camcorder TR6, NTSC format. All settings were on auto with exception of the focus on manual and the power zoom set at maximum. Camera 4 was a VHS RCA Camcorder Model CC275. The settings were on the auto position with exception of the focus set on manual and the lens set wide open. Data Analysis Using the resources provided by The Fund for Interactive Research in Space Technology, an in depth analysis of the data was performed. The photo and video analysis was per- formed by a company called SVP Digital Systems. They are located in Studio City, California, and have been performing these types of analyses for many years. A num- ber of well known commercial TV docu- mentaries have used this company for UFO video and still picture analysis. The expert handling this analysis was Jerry Barber. He is well known in the Southern California area for his expertise in this field. The certified report generated contains the following data: \"Analysis of the video footage supplied by Ventura-Santa Barbara MUFON through F.I.R.S.T. indicates the object is of a solid nature. Its trajectory and climb as- cent indicate it is not a conventional air- craft. It appears to have a gaseous shroud surrounding its core. Its ascent rate based on frame calculations indicates high veloc- ity movement. Still photos supporting the video eliminate camera or lens aberrations. This video has similar characteristics of footage I have studied from Florida, Arizona, and New Mexico, all of which were videotaped independent of this video.\" Conclusion: \"This object's speed can be calculated by its movement across the video frames (There are no exact reference points). Considering this frame movement (30fps), its speed is in the 4000 to 6000 mph range. Aeronautical movements indi- cate an object with advanced maneuverable characteristics, not indicative of any known aircraft. Its light characteristics seem to be self-emitting (light spectrum analysis) as opposed to reflections. I would classify the object as unidentifiable.\" The certified report was presented to us on December 21, 1996. Some observations made by Jerry during analysis were witnessed by the author. I watched as the computer was able to draw a solid outline around the object. This ob- ject appeared ovoid. Another observation made by the computer was that of multiple color bands surrounding the periphery of the object. One other portion of the com- puter analysis produced high magnification of the object as it transitioned from its vi- sual bright solid state to that of a straight line with several white puffs. The analysis suggested that the object at this point had no mass and appeared to be gaseous or cloud-like. Next our investigation involved tele- phonic conversations with the nearby air- ports and control towers, including Point Mugu Naval Air Station. Although no af- firmative data was ascertained by these calls, there was an interesting comment made by the naval tower operator. He On December 6th, a black triangular ob- ject large as two football fields report- edly passed silently over- head. It ap- peared to be thick and lighted around its external periphery with red, green and smaller dim, white lights.

I found this highly interesting. Our MUFON astronomer, Mr. Robert Moheit of Simi Valley, California, was able to supply us with a list and descriptions of astronomical objects and phenomena visi- ble during the surveillance period for cross-checking purposes. These included the usual suspects like Jupiter and Saturn, but also the Geminid, Leonid, and Quadrantid meteor showers. NASA Queries Persistent efforts were made to ascertain what types of hardware were orbiting dur- ing the time of our sightings. The only in- formation we could obtain was that of a negative nature. We were told that there were no satellites passing through the indi- cated area during the period in question. They also indicated that orbits of military satellites were classified and no informa- tion was available. It is my sincere feeling that although no specific identification was made of these objects, and while the photographs ob- tained did not show their nuts and bolts, the effort made by the individuals involved in this investigation were beyond the scope of other previous attempts. My sincere ap- preciation is extended to all of the partici- pants and investigators for their combined efforts.

February 1997 Number 346 Page 10 T he implications of the validity, or non-validity, of \"False Memory Syndrome\" (FMS) are of particular interest to researchers and therapists who are working directly with individuals who feel they have had alien encounters. A final study on FMS has just been completed by graduate psychology student Wendy Hovdestad under the direction of Professor Connie Kristiansen, at Carleton University's Department of Psychology in Ottawa, Canada. The research paper will appear in the Journal of Psychiatry and Law, Winter of 1996. \"False memory syndrome (FMS) is de- scribed as a serious form of psychopathol- ogy characterized by strongly believed pseudomemories of childhood abuse\", ac- cording to the Carleton report. The term was created by the FMS Foundation, a na- tional organization based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. As of the Winter of 1995 they had over 6,000 families nationwide who claim that their children had falsely accused them of abuse. It is believed by the Foundation that some therapists often deliberately suggest, lead or push their troubled patients into re- covering memories of abuse that never hap- pened. \"Proponents of the FMS theory ar- gue that most, or perhaps all, recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse are ia- trogenically induced pseudomemories,\" the report says. The definition of iatrogenic is: Induced in a patient by a therapist's activity, manner or therapy. Although the entire focus of both The FMS Foundation and the research recently completed at Carleton University is specifi- cally on childhood sexual abuse, what we are dealing with is how the mind remembers trauma. Therefore, I believe that this latest study has parallels for us in the field of Ufology and can most certainly be applied to the trauma of extraterrestrial or alien con- tact. Hypnotic regression has been under fire as one possible method of implanting false memories or leading individuals into believ- ing they have had unworldly encounters. It has been my personal experience, as a Clinical Hypnotherapist, that my clients are not easily led. If I test them, purposely us- ing misleading questions, not only will they correct me, but their answers are consistent if tested over several sessions. The latest report from Carleton University cites two researchers, Nelson and Simpson, who in 1994 worked with twenty \"retractors.\" These are people who have recovered memories of abuse that they now denounce as pseudomemories, or memories which are not true. Although the FMS Foundation states that \"FMS is char- acterized by strongly believed false memo- ries,\" according to the Carleton study, \"all of twenty retractors studied by Nelson and Simpson reported that they regularly doubted their pseudomemories...\" This sug- gests that false or implanted memories are not that readily accepted or believed. There are also, of course, cases where in- dividuals will retract cases of trauma or shock that actually occurred. More than 50 years ago, psychologist Milton Erickson re- counted why one of his patients recanted her story. She stated that one \"could only imagine it but could not possibly endure it.\" That is a common way in which abductees often deal with their experience; that is, to deny or invalidate it. In the case of close en- counters, the experience can be so weird, so unworldly, that denial not only temporarily feels comforting, but comes naturally be- cause it just doesn't fit and no previous ex- perience can explain it. Other reasons that abduction experiences get swept under the rug are to prevent ridicule or loss of credi- bility. Contrary to FMS theory, the Carleton study has shown that \"respondents with at least one recovered memory believed less strongly in the validity of their memories than did participants with exclusively con- tinuous memories.\" These results help demonstrate that recovered memories are questioned by the participant, which is healthy."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL For reference purposes the following four points or clusters make up the criteria for False Memory Syndrome. I. Pseudomemories that are: A. Strongly believed B. Central to the person's identity, and C.

Criterion IV is not required because there have been reports of pseudomemories occurring in the absence of therapy.\" One of the four clusters of symptoms of FMS is that \"a person develops what she believes to be long-lost memories of child sexual abuse of which she had been previ- ously entirely unaware.\" Similarly long- lost memories of alien abduction, suddenly remembered, whether outside of hypnosis or through hypnosis could come under fire as well, as being a product of FMS. According to the Carleton study, \"FMSF Executive Director Pamela Freyd argued that recovered memories are suspect if they involve longterm abuse, or preposterous events such as ritual abuse....\" Abduction can certainly fall into this category of \"longterm abuse\" because the abduction phenomenon is often not only a lifelong ex- perience, but can also be multi-generational; and, of course, many people also consider the very idea of abduction to be preposter- ous. The Carleton study found that \"partici- pants with at least one recovered memory reported abuse of significantly longer dura- tion than that reported by those with exclu- sively continuous memories.\" The criteria for FMS points specifically to the symptom of loss of memory for long-term abuse, sug- gesting that anyone who had undergone such trauma could not possibly have forgot- ten. The Carleton study stated that \"although this relation between abuse duration and memory is concordant with FMS theory,\" the study sited several previous studies that found, \"it is also consistent with clinical findings that longer durations of abuse are associated with more severe abuse, [and] in turn is associated with more memory loss.\" If these previous studies sited by the Carleton report are accurate, it would there- fore be quite possible for some abductees, whose experiences are quite traumatic and longterm, to not remember until something triggers their memory. Since the FMSF specifically is targeting the validity of recovered memories, the Carleton study also notes that a woman who has had continuous memory and remembers all aspects of her girlhood abuse therefore cannot have FMS either. Similarily, a large percentage of ab- ductees have conscious, life long continu- ous, though often fragmentary, memories of events recalled without the aid of hypnosis. These memories would not fall under the definition of FMS either. The first part of the Carleton study looked at continuous memory, versus recov- ered memory. Out of the original 113 women in the study, 13 were excluded as their answers were inconsistent. Of the 100 remaining women, 49 had continuous and/or conscious memories. The other 51 women had recovered memories of at least one incident or more. If we can draw a par- allel at all between the trauma of childhood sexual abuse and abduction, then these fig- ures might suggest that up to 49 percent of all female abductees, could potentially con- sciously remember abduction and wouldn't Flashbacks usually only last a few seconds and frequently in- volve missing time periods.

If, that is, we weren't dealing with one aspect that doesn't usually enter the world of childhood sexual abuse, and that is the mind manipu- lating and amnesia producing capabilities that these aliens seem to demonstrate. The alleged visitors are said to be experts at weaving complicated mind barriers into our psyches that go beyond the simple amnesia normally produced from traumatic events. Note: because the Carleton study included only women, parallels to the abduction ex- perience are being compared to female ab- ductees and are not meant to suggest that the statistics couldn't include male ab- ductees. When it comes to the validity of the crite- ria used to define FMS, it appears that the author of the definition of FMS, John Kihlstrom, was defensive. The Carleton re- port quotes him: \"I think it's a mistake to try to come up with DSM-like (1) diagnostic criteria for FMS. The reason for this is that I think it's a mistake to focus on FMS as a di- agnostic entity...'FMS' is really more like a social and professional problem.\" This hesi- .tation to categorize FMS as a mental health condition and to use it to diagnose someone is quite amazing considering prior state- ments by the FMSF. The Carleton report goes on to state that even FMSF 7 Executive Director Pamela Freyd has some difficulty with it. -When she \"was asked to provide di- agnostic criteria for FMS, for example, she said: 'I'm just going to take an aside here and say that [professional organizations] are the appropriate forums for developing the kinds of criteria I think you are asking for.'\" The Carleton report goes on to state: \"The reluctance to endorse any diagnostic criteria is even more surprising in light of the ap- peals to science made by FMS proponents because, unless FMS is defined in a way that allows empirical testing it is nonfalsifi- able and hence fundamentally unscientific.\" The findings from this recent Carleton study cannot be rejected by the FMSF when it appears that even they cannot adequately define the criteria for FMS. S ome other worthy findings from this study showed that 39.2% of the women who recovered their memories, did so inde- pendent of therapy. This is often seen with abductees who have memory flashbacks that are triggered suddenly by an event or situation, such as a picture that brings back a flood of memories. Flashbacks usually only last a few sec- onds and frequently involve missing time periods. When they surface, they can emerge suddenly and with great intensity. A good example of this happened for thou- sands of people across the country when, in 1987, Whitley Strieber's book Communion came out. For the first time on the cover of a national best seller, an illustration of a \"grey\" flooded the minds of many with un- comfortable feelings, and for others with memories they could not explain. Overall, the latest Carleton study re- vealed that of the women with recovered memories only \"two participants (3.9%) ful- filled both the pseudomemory and the rela- tionship criteria, the minimum requirements for a diagnosis of FMS, and neither of these women also met the therapy criterion.\" To summarize this finding, the percentage of 3.9% was the percentage of FMS found in women with recovered memories, when their scores were compared with a baseline of women who had always remembered their abuse and were normal non-pathologi- cal survivors, according to FMSF standards. For a baseline comparison, it was important first to establish scores for \"true survivors,\" those who had always remembered their abuse and therefore did not have FMS. What this 3.9% figure might also suggest is that recovered memories, whether remem- bered outside of therapy, or through modali- ties such as hypnosis, are far more reliable than the FMSF would have us believe. A second estimate was taken to discover how many women with continuous memory could also be diagnosed as having FMS. In this second estimate, the findings were de- rived from those who identified very strongly and scored high as an abuse sur- vivor (see criterion I-B above), scoring for example 4 or 5 on the five point identity scale. This same standard of testing was also applied to women with recovered memories. According to the study, what this second estimate found was \"an upper limit of 13.6%,\" a rate that was equivalent in both women with continuous memories, as well as recovered memories. Just how accu- rate are the guideline criteria for FMS when even those outside the criteria requirements (those with continuous memories) can qual- ify? It is important to also note that according to this study, the requirement was \"the ful- Continued on Page 16"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Weirdness on the Web Say what you will about ufologists, just don't call them cautionary, a failing that has only been exacerbated by the exponential explosion of computers, digital imaging software and the World Wide Web. The most recent example of a hoaxed photo re- sulting in an Internet tempest occurred in December of last year when Dr. Courtney Brown appeared on the Art Bell Show and announced his possession of a photo pur- porting to show a huge object several times the size of the Earth accompanying the comet Hale-Bopp. Brown, who heads up the Farsight Institute (http://www.farsight.org). said he received the picture on a roll of un- developed 35mm film. (Shades of MJ-12!) The film came from a supposedly promi- nent astronomer who wished to remain anonymous. Reportedly, the astronomer said that radio signals had also been re- ceived from the comet's companion and were presently being analysed. A press con- ference was to be announced in about a week. Meanwhile, Brown conducted his own analysis from afar. The Institute's remote viewers were asked to tune in on the com- panion object and report back, a remote viewer, in this case, being an alleged psy- chic, or \"sensitive.\" Sure enough, the object turned out to be intelligently controlled, teeming with benevolent aliens and headed our way. It would arrive sometime early this year, the aliens would announce their pres- ence, the world would change overnight, and so on. Whatever. Unfortunately for this already nonsensi- cal scenario.

Tombaugh, the only individual to discover a planet in this century, passed away at his home in Las Cruces, New Mexico, on January 17th of this year, aged 90. In 1930, while employed at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, Tombaugh discovered the planet Pluto by painstakingly searching through photographic plates taken on a specially de- signed 13-inch diameter wide-field tele- scope. Each plate contained more than 50,000 individual points of light. \"There are 15 million stars in the sky as bright as Pluto,\" he once said. \"I had to pick one im- age out of the 15 million.\" He was only 24 at the time. Interestingly, although it didn't make it into his obituary in The New York Times, Tombaugh also had his own UFO sighting. Jim Moseley, editor of Saucer Smear, talked to him not too long after the event. The fol- lowing account is excerpted from Moseley's article, \"UFOs Out West,\" which will ap- pear in UFOs 1947-1997: From Arnold to Abductees, Fifty Years of a Phenomenon, edited by Dennis Stacy and Hilary Evans, and scheduled to be published later this year. \"Dr. Tombaugh, interviewed at his home in Las Cruces, New Mexico, told me (as he had told many others) of the evening in 1949 when, while sitting outdoors, he saw an apparently solid object directly overhead, which then moved to the SSE in about three seconds, and disappeared at a height of 35 or 40 degrees above the horizon. It was yel- lowish-green in color, and had about ten rectangular lights arranged in a symmetrical pattern. His wife was with him, and she no- ticed a faint glow coming from the object as a whole, though he did not; but he too be- lieves it was one solid object because of the way the lights held their pattern and because of the symmetry. \"It was a cloudless night, and Tombaugh had no way of knowing the size or height of the object. Interestingly, he stated that in spite of his scientific background, he was very unnerved by the experience, and there- fore failed to study the object as carefully as he would have liked to do. He refused to ex- press an opinion as to its origin.\" Just like a good scientist should. A CATALOG OF UFO-RELATED PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS by John F.

Although I was on a remote island continent in the southern hemisphere on the other side of the world, I found myself listening to detailed accounts of contact with extraordinary beings and UFOs. Was the information different? No. Were the creatures different - perhaps re- flecting the cultural influence or beliefs of Australians? No. Were the little grays the typical type of alien reported (undoubtedly influenced, one might hypothesize, by me- dia information and images)? No, the grays were reported, but so were the lesser known types that most Australian abductees were not familiar with — the tall blondes, reptil- ians, and praying mantis types. Were Australian abductees different either psy- chologically or in their emotional reactions to these reported events? No, they were willing to speak privately but exhibited so many of the same healthy and credible reac- tions to such extraordinary encounters. The same need existed to somehow fit these bizarre experiences into their ordinary lives. Helpful therapists and serious investigators are creating healthy support groups from Perth to Melbourne to Sydney to Brisbane and even over in New Zealand. Even the accompanying and correlating physical evidence was so much the same. Dehydrated circular patches of soil, mag- netic readings, crushed plants, triangular bruises, scoop marks, and unexplained inci- sions were all present and like those re- ported in the States. Even several reports by farmers in Western Australia described black helicopters chasing UFOs. I just didn't find any significant differences in the data that was shared with me by abductees and researchers alike. I had to pinch myself to remember that I truly was no longer in the United States. A nurse from Sydney named Sharon re- vealed the following details in a hypnosis session with myself. She recalled that large balls of light visited her often at her bed- room window when she was a child. She would enter the orange ball of light and be taken to a playground with other children — who also arrived in balls of light. But she noted that the playground seemed to have \"fake grass\" and a \"dome for a sky.\" She perceived that this was a constructed decep- tion just to make all the children \"feel at home.\" Then all the children were led to ta- bles (at least 50) where exams were per- formed by reptilian beings in white \"lab coats\" under close supervision by tall grays nearby! A therapist from Melbourne described an early childhood phobia of bats — which made no sense because she could physically hold bats and demonstrate no actual fear. But the black slanting pair of bat wings were what she thought she had seen at her window as a child. But then she realized that they were the eyes of a little man. She also recalled tall praying mantis beings with \"blowfly eyes\" — which her aunt also inde- pendently remembered along with clear memories of UFOs landing in the vacant lot nearby. Then she also had stunning recollec- tions of a tall reptilian being picking her up \"like a baby\" and walking her through a \"shimmering wall of light\" and into a saucer-shaped craft. The reptilian had the classic yellow-gold iris cat-eyes, webbed claw-hands, and green scaly skin. And to add further credibility, her brother reported one night seeing a reptilian-like creature with deep yellow eyes move swiftly from her window across the bedroom toward her. He got the distinct impression that he wasn't supposed to have seen that; he had simply gotten up to go the bathroom and caught sight of it by accident. Brenda also reports having a number of visitations by tall humanoids with shoulder-length coarse blonde hair with piercing blue eyes. She was told that the Egyptian pyramids used to shimmer as if \"alive\" and utilize some form of electromagnetic energy. She did not un- derstand all that she was told nor try to make further sense out of these pieces of in- formation. A delightfully expressive and articulate therapist from Perth named Elizabeth Robinson had been trying to cope with memories of scary \"clowns\" that came quickly toward her at night from a strange blue light in her home.

But when her Mom called more recently, Elizabeth was told about a dream, \"that I was looking out the back window and saw these lights and knew that the aliens were coming.

All of these cases and many more can be viewed in my new re- search video, \"Encounters in Australia\" (see ad in Classifieds).

FALSE MEMORY SYNDROME - Continued from Page 12 fillment of only one of the indicators of a false memory, only one of the relationship disruption subcriteria and only three of the five therapy subcriteria. \" Because of this liberal approach, it is quite possible that the women who met these criteria may have lit- tle in common with a true or typical FMS victim. What this means is that the end fig- ures of 3.9 to 13.6 percent, the percentage of those who fell within the definition of FMS, may be even lower. In summary the Carieton study concludes that \"the present findings may mean that FMS is real, but rare.\" Furthermore the re- port suggests that FMS may not exist at all and that FMSF's criteria for empirically testing FMS stands on an \"authoritarian op- position to the equality of women and a need to deny the injustice of child abuse.\" Often times, when there is so much to lose and so much at stake, one technique is to attack everyone else and create so much confusion, that no one knows what is really going on. In the case of those who screamed so loudly, that they had been falsely accused of perpetrating sexual abuse, they dragged in every other absurdity they could think of that would fit their dangerous False Memory Syndrome, including people who think they have been abducted by aliens. After all, it should be reasonably easy to es- tablish the validity of false memory by ex- amining the memories of abductees. The well entrenched UFO debunking and dis- crediting campaign could serve well to demonstrate the validity of false memories. After all, who believes someone who tells stories of abduction? UFO abduction could be the perfect cover to prove false memory does exist. But, on the other hand, if the Carieton study shows that FMS is rare at best and might not exist at all, then the claims of ab- ductees cannot be brushed away with the FMS explanation. In closing, when there is a paradigm to protect, proving that FMS does exist could come in quite useful. One of the greatest threats to the continuation of the current world power structure, and our personal re- ality myth, is happening as I speak.

I n early December of 1996. my wife and I had the opportunity to travel to San Antonio and to visit with Whitley and Anne Strieber for several hours one Sunday after- noon. (I had met them in Australia at the First Annual Australian UFO Conference held in Brisbane the previous October.) After lunch at a fashionable, old town restaurant, the Striebers invited us to spend the afternoon with them touring San Antonio and visiting the secret places of Whitley's childhood. As we enjoyed the warm, spring like weather, Whitley pointed out to us where his childhood home had once stood in the affluent Terrell Hills neighborhood, its quiet streets lined with beautiful live oaks and expansive, well- manicured lawns. He showed us the route he used to take on his bike as a nine-year- old child through darkened residential streets on his way to his mid-night sessions at the \"secret school\" in the nearby woods. His memories of those mysterious classes, conducted by a strange hooded woman, whom he took to be a nun at the time, had always stopped at the point of his arrival at a huge, barrel-chested live oak tree where a small hut stood. He only vaguely recalled the small benches that he and other neighborhood children would sit on as they were taught unknown lessons by the hooded figure. As an adult, he had searched for the strange tree and the school, but had not been able to find them, although the woods located in the Olmos Basin are still intact near Incarnate Word University. But all that changed one day when he went to the woods with a film crew that asked to interview him in the area of his childhood memory. As he showed the film crew around, he suddenly noticed an old path leading diagonally up a steep hill. Half way up the hill he found the old tree and the remnants of the secret school. The discov- ery shocked his memory and soon the truth behind the secret school became known to him. As we got out of the car in the parking lot of Incarnate Word and headed up the path into the woods, I wondered how a small boy would have the courage to enter this dark and secluded area alone in the middle of the night. The main path is but a small trail, crowded on both sides by encroaching trees and vegetation. At night it must be truly op- pressive and frightening. For a while, Whitley was understandably disoriented and couldn't find the hidden path leading up the side of the steep incline. But eventually, he spotted what can only be described as a faint, diagonal cut in the side of the hill, barely wide enough for one person. It is overgrown with weeds and small trees and requires some effort to climb. But there is no doubt that at one time a long time ago it was used as a footpath by someone. Its straight edge leads to an astonishing tree that cannot be seen from the main path—a gnarled giant that looks as if it belongs in a fairy tale about dwarves and gnomes. Further up the footpath and to the right lie the remains of an ancient wooden structure and what appear to be small benches—the site of the secret school. As we stood looking at this evidence of a long-forgotten past and as Whitley de- scribed the bizarre nature of the lessons he learned there as a child, I wondered how the pubic would react to his tales of traveling The Secret School: Preparation for Contact by Whitley Strieber Afterword by Ed Conroy Hb, 245 pages, $24.00 HarperCollins, 1997 ISBN 0-06-018731- X February 1997 Number 346 Page 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Joe Lewels is MUFON Assis- tant State Di- rector for West Texas and Southern N.M. and author of The God Hypothesis: Extraterrestri- al Life and its Implications for Science and Religion.

Now that I have read his book, I wonder how they will react to his startling and frighten- ing prophesies of a stark and terrible future that awaits us. Surely there will be those who want to believe that he is mad or sim- ply making the whole thing up to sell an- other book. But for me, the story is all too familiar, for Whitley's story is no more bizarre and no more unbelievable than that of any of the other thousands of persons who have had alien encounters. Once you have investigated dozens of cases as I have, and once you have gotten to know experi- encers and their families as I have, you be- gin to realize that the reality we are all fa- miliar with is not all there is. Once you ac- cept that even one person has had alien en- counters, you must resign yourself to the fact that you really don't understand much about the nature of reality at all. In listening to Strieber's story, I found all the familiar aspects of the abduction cases I have investigated and am still investigating, here in the Southwest, as well as in Mexico and even Australia. For example, I have found numerous cases in which the experi- encers have very little recall of their child- hood—in some cases they recall nothing be- fore their teenage years. Under hypnosis, they are often able to recall in sharp detail many of the events of childhood, long for- gotten. Later, they often have spontaneous recollection of much more, as if the hypno- sis opened the floodgates of some secret ocean of memories that had been dammed up for decades. In almost every case, the memories include lessons that were taught to them by alien creatures about the myster- ies of the universe. These are lessons about the human soul, the nature of death, the de- struction that man has done to the Earth and the horrible consequences that we will have to endure. Quite often ihese lessons take place on other planets (to which they are taken in the blink of an eye) where they wit- ness strange events and meet strange crea- tures for purposes they don't really under- stand. I had to conclude after listening to his story that I could find no discernible difference between his case and those of the many oth- ers I have studied. The one big difference is that Strieber is perhaps the best known and most eloquent spokesperson for the phe- nomenon we call \"abduction\" (for lack of a better term.) He uses his professional exper- tise as a writer to tell his story in bone-chill- ing prose that would easily, fit into any one of the many horror novels he has written. It could be that this is what many of his critics dislike about him. His books are so well written that they almost seem like novels. Certainly he must be fabricating or at least exaggerating, they say. But no, I think not. I found him to be extremely bright and criti- cal of his own perceptions of reality. I also believe that he is completely honest. His de- cision to go public with his experiences, contrary to what many may believe, has had a detrimental effect on his career and on his personal life. He was aware of the risk he was taking when he wrote his first book on the subject, Communion, in 1987. But un- like the Strieber of ten years ago who still doubted the reality of the visitors and wished they would go away, the Strieber of today is sure of who he is and who they are. He has learned to leave his fears behind him and has found that accepting their presence has opened up new worlds of understanding beyond his wildest dreams. The UFO community needs Strieber and others like him whose powers of observa- tion and description can convey to us the richness and depth of the visitor experience just as NASA needs video cameras in space to allow the rest of us to perceive the texture and grandeur of the universe. And we re- searchers should remember that were it not for the worldwide impact of his books, we would not have the abundance of cases that have come forward over the past ten years for us to investigate. Was there a secret school? Most certainly there was. In fact, as researchers know, all experiencers are members of that school and now it's time to find out what the sub- stance of those strange and dark teachings were.

These researchers contend that NICAP would have folded anyway, from a combination of financial troubles and diminished public interest due to the negative Condon Report. Strong testi- mony exists, however, that certain persons on the NICAP Board and among Washington, D. C. NICAP officials, were FBI and CIA agents who capitalized on NICAP's troubles to bring it down. On another subject, the reel-to-reel tapes in McDonald's archives are not available to researchers presently, due to their fragile condition.

Since we are all acronym-possessed, may I propose \"AAA\" for \"An Alien Apparition.\" I believe it will, in the future, categorize the ET/human encounter phe- nomenon. I was especially surprised to read Dr. Lammer's rendering of Debbie Jordan's alleged MILAB. I went to three bookstores looking for Ms. Jordan's book, Abducted! (co-written with her sister, Kathy Mitchell), and finally found it at a local library. Jordan claims she was stunned by an \"alleged\" friend she calls \"Dave\" and forcibly brought by him and others to a \"hospital.\" Debbie's best friend worked with Dave at a large factory and introduced them. Dave, says Debbie, was crazy about her and \"couldn't take his hands off her. They knew each other several months before Dave asked her to go away to his cabin for a romantic weekend. As soon as she got out of his car, Debbie was drugged and kid- napped. Brought to a strange installation and undressed, she underwent a physical examination and was probed \"from every opening of my body.\" Then, the \"Doctor\" removed a \"bug\" from her ear. Debbie never heard from Dave after he dropped her home the very next day. Instead of calling the police to report a kidnapping, assault and who knows what other criminal charges could have been brought against Dave, instead, Debbie called Budd Hopkins. Several years later, Debbie's best friend ran into Dave at the plant she worked in. Apparently, Dave wasn't hiding from anyone after committing these crimes. I consider Debbie Jordan's behavior— allowing \"mysterious\" Dave to continue using other women for nefarious purposes When will someone separate the sexually- repressed fan- tasies of lonely women from the ab- duction genre?

When will someone separate the sexu- ally-repressed fantasies of lonely women from the abduction genre and sort out what belongs in therapy and what belongs in the MUFON Journal 1 ? —Victoria Alexander Las Vegas, NV From the same article, please note the cor- rect address for Katharina Wilson's \"Alien Jigsaw\" site: http://www.alienjigsaw.com McDonald Correction Ann Druffel, author of a forthcoming bi- ography of physicist/UFO researcher James E. McDonald, informs me that I am in error when I state (in a quote from my book High Strangeness, cited in the Journal's January issue, p.8) that McDonald's family signed him out of a Tucson psychiatric ward shortly before his suicide. She tells me that the decision was his alone. I apologize for the error and am sorry for any discomfort I may have caused the McDonald family.

Space Junk Lands in Guadalupe County On January 24, 1997, Ed Longcope was driving his pickup truck through one of his cattle pastures when he noted a metal ball imbedded in the soil. He alerted the Guadalupe County Sheriff's office in Seguin, Texas, who responded promptly to the locale at Wade Road and FM Highway 3353, 16 miles northeast of the MUFON of- fice. Deputy Sheriffs Tod Friesenhahn and Stephen Moore removed the metal sphere from the eight inch deep hole and trans- ported same to the Guadalupe Sheriff's of- fice. Walt Andrus was contacted to help identify the object which was reported as a UFO in the official report. The round metal sphere was 23 inches in diameter and 75 inches in circumference. This is a preview of a more detailed fea- ture article that will appear in the March 1997 issues of the MUFON UFO Journal. The photo shows the indented hole in the pasture and the well preserved metal ball space junk that was removed. — Walt Andrus February 1997 Number 346 Page 20 More on McDonald Kudos to Ann Druffel for her efforts to preserve the UFO papers and tapes on the late Dr. James E. McDonald and to make arrangements for them to become available to researchers at the University of Arizona Library, as reported in the latest issue of the Journal. Although Jim and I sharply disagreed about UFOs, I very much admired his ded- icated efforts and the fact that he candidly expressed his views on UFOs — whether speaking to a NICAP audience or to Naval Research Laboratory scientists. If Jim were alive today, I wonder what he would think about UFOlogy's current infatuation with \"UFO-abductions\" and \"crashed saucers.\" — Philip Klass Washington, DC"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL THE ANOMALIST 4 Articles by Colin Wilson (\"An Egyptian State of Mind\").

Shining brightly at magnitude -1.3 between the stars Spica and Regulus, the red planet rises in the E at sunset and remains visible all night in the southern sky. Three days after opposition. Mars is nearest Earth at a distance of 61.5 million miles. Tele- scopic observers can study the planet's tiny disc (14\" of arc diameter) which shows a white north polar cap and ocher- colored deserts. Yellow or orange filters enhance the con- trast of dark surface features; blue filters reveal the planet's ice clouds. Saturn (magnitude 0.8), in Pisces, lies very low in the W at dusk, setting about an hour after the Sun in midmonth. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars crosses the SW sky and sets in the W about sunrise. Jupiter (-2.0), in Capricornus, rises in the ESE around 4 AM. The planet's visibility continues to improve during March. Comet Hale-Bopp: The month begins with Hale-Bopp about 20° up in the ENE morning sky before dawn (at lat. 40° N). The comet contin- ues to brighten. By mid-March the object can also be glimpsed low (about 10° up) in the NW after dusk. At this time the most optimistic predictions place the comet's brightness as comparable to the brightest star Sirius. Hale- Bopp passes nearest Earth on the 23rd (a distant 123 mil- lion miles). Toward the end of March the comet is most easily seen in the evening sky after twilight, 20° up in the NW. For viewers N of lat. 45°, Hale-Bopp now remains above the horizon all night. Optimum visibility for mid- northern observers occurs early next month. To observe the comet with little or no moonlight, best dates are between March 6 and 20 and between March 28 and April 10. Partial Lunar Eclipse: On the night of March 23-24, observers throughout the U.S. will see the full moon nearly totally eclipsed (93% of the Moon's diameter). At 9:57 PM (EST) the SE edge of our satellite slips into the Earth's dark central shadow (the um- bra). Greatest eclipse occurs at 11:39. Umbral eclipse ends at 1:21 AM. Mars presents a pleasing sight only 10° from the Moon. Alaska experiences a 60 to 80% partial eclipse of the Sun on March 8. The event begins about 4:30 PM. Moon Phases: Last quarter—March 2 New moon—March 8 First quarter—March 15 Full moon—March 23 February 1997 Number 346 Page 22 c The Stars: The celestial meridian (imaginary N-S line passing through the zenith) divides the heavens into the emerging spring star patterns to the E and the winter groups to the W. Leo the Lion in the SE steadily advances westward toward the meridian in midevening. Below Leo lies the longest as well as one of the faintest constellations in the sky—Hydra the Sea Serpent. The leg- endary monster's 5-starred head is located between Regulus (in Leo) and Procyon (in Canis Minor). Not far below his head lies the star Alphard (aptly meaning \"the solitary one\"), the only fairly bright star in the whole rambling con- stellation. You will have to wait until around midnight in order to trace the entire outline of the serpent: his tail ends below Virgo and Libra. Riding on top of Hydra's writhing coils are three other equally obscure patterns. From W to E, they are Sextans the Sextant, Crater the Cup. and Corvus the Crow.

Time will be allocated for short activity reports from each State and Provincial Director. If the State Director will be unable to attend, he/she should designate someone to represent them. The MUFON Annual Board of Directors meeting will take place on Sunday, July 13th from 9 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. STATE AND LOCAL MEETINGS John C. Thompson, Georgia State Director con- ducted a state membership meeting in Smyrna, GA, at the library on January 19th in which 90 people at- tended. Three newspapers, one TV station, and a film crew from the TV program \"Strange Universe\" publi- cized the event. I cite this affair only because it is an example of what can be done anywhere in North America to educate the public and to train and orga- nize a Field Investigator's network. Georgia is a rela- tively large state geographically, however, state meet- ings on a periodic basis could be held in smaller states such as Rhode Island, Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Delaware, and Maine, as examples. Peter R. Geremia, New Hampshire State Director, has carried this idea one step upward by conducting an annual UFO conference for six consecutive years. As a result of this interest, there are more MUFON mem- bers percentage-wise to the population in New Hampshire than in any other state. Pete is to be con- gratulated for his endeavors in behalf of MUFON as a superb example. The individual state section directors in the bor- oughs composing New York City have met to plan ac- tivities for the metropolitan area. North Carolina has solved the problems of driving to state meetings by scheduling quarterly meetings in different major cities. California has always been divided into two population centers, Los Angeles and San Francisco, to easier facilitate state meetings. Texas and Alaska pose more difficult problems geographically, however, Alaska did have a state section directors meeting in Anchorage a few years ago. People like to share UFO knowledge, experiences, and field investigator training, therefore local meet- ings in larger cities are highly recommended in order to organize investigative teams. The scientific study of ufology is a unique and highly important facet of the UFO enigma. For more information about organizing a local UFO study group, please refer to the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual. It is a gratifying and re- warding experience to build a group of people into a coherent team sharing the same interests. FIELD INVESTIGATOR'S EXAM Anyone who has purchased and studied the 4th edition of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual is eligible to take the exam via mail when they feel qualified. The 100-question test may be secured from MUFON headquarters in Seguin and returned to Kathleen F. Marden, 103 Willow Road, East Kingston, NH 03827, for grading. In localities where field investiga- tor training classes are conducted, the instructor may order sufficient quantities of the test and administer the exam at the conclusion of the training classes. However, the majority of people will study the manual like a correspondence course before taking the exam. It is an open book test and other references may be utilized to broaden the scope of your knowledge. For current members, the new manual may be purchased for $25.00 plus $3.50 for postage and handling from MUFON in Seguin.

Mr. Balthaser was the guest speaker at their first monthly program on January 11, 1997. We extend our best wishes to Mrs. Crosby and her staff at IUFOMRC. CURRENT UFO SIGHTING REPORTS In order to publish current UFO sighting reports in the Journal, it is imperative that the Regional Directors write a short summary of interesting cases when they are being processed across their desks, before mailing them to T. David Spencer for computer input. Journal readers may get the impression that there are no legitimate UFO sightings if they relied only upon published reports. For this procedure to be effective, the State Directors must evaluate and forward reports promptly to their Regional Directors. Continued on Page 23"}]
