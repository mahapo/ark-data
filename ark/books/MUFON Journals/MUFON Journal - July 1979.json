FROM THE EDITOR Wouldn't it be nice if there were a publicly supported fund to make grants for UFO research? Well, there is — or soon will be. A small group of MUFON members and others in and around Washington, D.C., has partially organized a \"Fund For UFO Research and hopes to get underway early in 1980. A progress report appears in this issue. The group also is making plans for a \"rapid response capability\" to assure that important new cases with potentially high scientific yield are promptly investigated. Then, if the case looks promising, the Fund will consider granting money for whatever follow-up research or analysis is needed. The Tenth Annual MUFON UFO Symposium July 7 & 8 in San Francisco was highly successful. The August issue of the Journal will provide special coverage of the symposium, including photographs, for the benefit of those who were unable to attend.

The original report, published in French, was confined to 140 copies and has had very limited distribution. The summary was released by a person well known to MUFON and CUFOS, who had access to a copy in Europe. In our meeting with Alain Esterle, Ph.D., on June 23 and 24 in Clear Lake City, Texas, he confirmed that the summary as reported in the October/November 1978 edition of the International UFO Reporter was essentially correct with only one correction. In nine of the eleven cases, the conclusion was that the witnesses had witnessed a material phenomenon that could not be explained as a natural phenomenon or a human device. Since the conclusions drawn from the GEPAN report are very significant to UFO research, we asked Dr. Esterle for GEPAN's official statement. In order that there would be no doubt, he presented a copy in French of their conclusions and promptly translated it very carefully into English. Considering the elements we have collected from the observers at the very place of their observation, we are convinced that a material phenomenon originates the quasi totality of the observations and notice that the description of these phenomena is similar (in particular in the following cases: Gondrecourt, Bize, Lucon, Bolazec, Cussac, Sauvigny) to that of a flying machine whose origin and propulsion and/or sustenance modes are totally out of our knowledge. Since the MUFON UFO Journal is distributed throughout the world, some of our readers may prefer to do their own translation to obtain the full significance of this important Alain Esterle statement, which some may consider very conservative. Compte tenu des elements que nous avons recueillis aupres des observateurs, sur les lieux memes de leur observation, nous avons la conviction qu'un phenomene materiel est a I'origine de la quasi-totalite des observations et constatons que la descripton de ces phenomenes s'apparente, en particulier dans les cas suivants: Gondrecourt, Bize, Lucon, Bolazec, Cussac et Sauvigny, a celle d'une machine volante, dont la provenance, les modes de sustentation et/ou de propulsion sont totalement estrangers a nos connaissances. When the \"Presentation of the Scientific Counsel of GEPAN of Studies Undertaken During the First Semester of 1978\" was published, this concluded one important phase of their continuing work under the funding of Centre National D'Etudes Spatiales (CNES), which may be likened to NASA in the United States. At this point, Dr. Claude Poher, who had headed GEPAN from its inception, elected to take a 2-year sabbatical to travel around the world in his personally constructed sailboat. To fill the vacancy created, Dr. Alain Esterle was promoted to the position of Chief of GEPAN, or in the U.S.A. we might say the manager or head of this prestigious scientific group. Alain received a degree from Poly- technique (Paris), a B.S. in Political. Sciences (Toulouse), and then completed his advanced education in the U.S.A. at the University of Washington (Seattle), where he was awarded a Masters in Aeronautics and Astronautics and a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics in 1973. Dr. Esterle is 32 years old, married, and has a son who is 20 months old. His wife, Genevieve, has participated actively in field interviews made by the GEPAN investigative teams.

Since all serious UFO groups share the same problem, lack of money to pursue in- depth investigation and research, it was felt that a publicly-supported fund set up to make grants would be beneficial to everyone and would have the potential to advance scientific knowledge. We know that over 50% of Americans take UFOs seriously, and a well-publicized fund to which they could donate for scientific research could be a reallying point for public support. The Fund will have a 15-member National Board, at least 5 of whom will live in the Washington, D.C., area and constitute an Executive Committee. The Committee has been formed: Dr. Bruce S. Maccabee, Navy scientist, is Chairman and Craig Phillips, zoologist and Director of the National Aquarium, is Vice-Chairman. The other members are Lt. Thomas P. Deuley, USN (Secretary); Dr. John B. Carlson, astronomer, University of Maryland; and Dr. David Schwartzman, Geology Department Chairman, Howard University. A number of nationally prominent persons are being invited to serve on the Board; the Fund is trying to achieve some kind of balance among scientists, other professionals, and public figures. The Board will evaluate proposals from anyone, on their merits, and depending on the Fund balance, make grants for projects that show potential for advancing scientific knowledge of and public education about UFOs. The Fund is in the process of incorporating and applying for tax exempt status, and hopes to begin accepting proposals about January 1980. In an effort to obtain seed money for start-up costs, a program of Founding Contributorships is being offered for the balance of 1979. Anyone contributing $100, $500, or $1,000 in 1979 will be eligible to receive a range of benefits according to the amount. Until tax exempt status is obtained, Founding Contributorships may or may not also be tax deductible. Tax exempt status can be made retroactive if there are no hitches in the application process, but the Fund cannot promise that this will happen. I am Acting Treasurer and an alternate to the Executive Committee. If you are interested in becoming a Founding Contributor and want more information, or if you wish to be notified of future developments, write to me at 4418 39th St., Brentwood, MD 20722. (GEPAN, Continued) , spending two days with Alain, we found him to be a very intelligent, perceptive, and congenial individual. We look forward to a fine degree of cooperation between GEPAN and MUFON in UFO scientific investigations and research. An exchange of publications has already been established. Interchange of reports will be concentrated in the most significant cases involving close encounters of the second and third kinds. Since Dr. Esterle also wanted to tour the Lyndon B. Johnson NASA Space Center during his visit to Houston, Richard C. Niemtzow, M.D., scheduled the meeting with Alain for Saturday, June 23, at the library meeting room in Clear Lake City, Texas. He was particularly interested in the work being done by the MUFON group in Houston, known as VISIT (Vehicular Internal Systems Investigative Team) who sponsored and hosted this private, but very informative meeting. John Schuessler, MUFON Deputy Director of Administration, chaired the meeting and introduced the participants. Presentations were made as follows: John Schuessler — \"Introduction to VISIT\"; Walt Andrus - \"Mutual UFO Network Inc.\"; Alain Esterle — \"The Activities and Organization of GEPAN\"; Richard Niemtzow, M.D. — \"Medical Effects\" and \"The Tyler Case\"; Jack Sassard — \"Tape Analysis in the Tyler Case\"; Dave Kissinger — 'Vehicle Analysis\"; and Paul Levy (Senior. Editor of the National Enquirer) — \"Enquirer Plans and Current Cases under Study.\" A delightful dinner was held Saturday evening when some of the wives joined the informal session — Kathy Schuessler, Jackie Niemtzow, and Karen Kissinger. More informal sessions were held on Sunday morning with a brunch hosted by John and Kathy Schuessler, followed by a tour of the nearby NASA Space Center in the afternoon. Richard and Jackie Niemtzow entertained a small group at a barbecue honoring Dr. Esterle on Sunday evening. Dr. Esterle was highly impressed with the caliber of talent that exists in MUFON and the host group VISIT. Thomas K. Nicholl, MUFON Deputy Director of Business Management (Leawood, Kansas) and Ray Stanford, Director of Project Starlight International (Austin, Texas), planned to attend this outstanding meeting but reluctantly cancelled at the last minute due to other commitments. VISIT will be hosting the 1980 MUFON Symposium on Saturday and Sunday, June 7 and 8, at the Clear Lake High School, just south of Houston, Texas, with speakers, movies, and workshops on Saturday. The Annual Corporate Meeting of MUFON will occur on Sunday morning, and the afternoon will be devoted to a tour of Lyndon B. Johnson NASA Space Center where such attractions as the Space Shuttle, Skylab, Apollo, Lunar Lander, and Moon rocks may be viewed."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"GERMAN MUFON CONFERENCE REPORT: NEW SCIENTIFIC THEORIES (Editor's Note: The Central European Section of MUFON, German-speaking members, held their 1978 conference at the University of Tubingen, Germany. The program schedule was reported in Journal No. 130, September 1978. MUFON-C.E.S. placed a report on the conference in the magazine ESOTERA; Hlobrand uon Ludwiger has provided this translation. Comments for publication are invited from scientists about the theories presented. Hlobrand von Ludwiger's address is D-8152 Feldkirchen- Westerham, G.-Hauptmann-Str. 5, Germany.) The 1978 annual MUFON-Central European Section-Conference was held in September at the University of Tubingen, Germany, with present members (30 scientists and engineers). A. Schneider presented a summary of UFO sightings and transparent fireballs during WW2 over Germany. For example, in 1959 the following account was given by a reliable source in Russia: \"One of our pilots flew straight into a 'fireball'. An investigation upon landing revealed not the slightest trace of a collision. The UFO simply expanded shortly before collision and allowed the airplane to slip through without resistance. Immediately afterwards, the fireball contracted again and flew on as if nothing had happened. Strangely though, the etheral object displayed a clearly intelligent behavior in attempting to evade the plane's machine-gun fire in a wild zigzag flight.\" ' On account of such descriptions, many scientists regard the contention of extraterrestrial origin of UFOs extremely skeptically. It is possible that influences from parallel worlds or other dimensions are evincing themselves as' H. .Malthaner discussed in his contribution. Such considerations have been especially elaborated by Jacques Vallee in his book Passport to Magonia in which the sometimes striking similarities between UFO contacts and fairy stories is noted. J. Keel takes this a step further in his belief, based on the manifold Psi effects in the vicinity of UFOs, that the phenomena are paranormally effected. It remains uncontested in spite of such speculations that such flying objects have already been sighted by hundreds of thousands of people and in some instances photographed as well. This was illustrated by the films obtained from the U.S. Air Force by C. Huffer, a mathematician in Berlin, and B. Biffiger, a student in Wallis, Switzerland. Though a strip from Montana showing the flight of two UFO's (spheres) was already familiar, the BBC film appeared sensational. This strip, which was recently broadcast by Swiss Television as part of a program dedicated to UFOs, shows a round bright white object approaching . a flying Concorde from above. As the UFO reaches the right wing surface, it stops descent and flys slowly past the plane's windows toward the cockpit. After the object, of about one meter diameter, has passed several windows, it takes off again vertically and disappears. (MUFON-CES will analyze the phases of motion and the relative size of this flying object and attempt to obtain the original of this film.) Various experts have continually raised the question of why UFOs are so seldom sighted on radar screens. This is partially due to the fact that UFOs generally travel in velocity ranges different from those of normal aircraft. In order to construct a radar device suitable for UFO monitoring, a series of premises must, according to Dipl.- Phys. H. Brauser, first be clarified: the \"monostatic\" radar systems of today are in general' unsuitable for UFO sighting. Bistationary systems with separate .transmitters and receivers would be much more advantageous. Secondary radar, in use f&r many years, which operates on the \"transponder\" principle (i.e., which transmits coded messages and receives the actively transmitted response ^from the airplane) is not capable of detecting passive objects. Thus UFOs, which are not equipped with transponder^, are simply suppressed on the radar screen in order not to encumber the flight controllers with irrelevant information. Since civil flight control is at present not equipped with suitable instruments for UFO detection, we are as dependent as ever on eye-witness reports. In an impressive number of reports, there is talk of strange light rays which appear almost solid and are sometimes curved or interrupted and often stop abruptly in midair. Dr. A. Bucher, a laser specialist from Switzerland, treated the topic of the observation spectrum of such \"solid lights\" in detail; the rays are usually cylindrical, hollow, or solid and are directed from the UFO toward the ground, the sky, or the witness. Occasionally they scan the surroundings and sometimes the rays are slowly advanced and withdrawn. In several cases, the rays also penetrated house walls, weather fences, earthen mounds, or even hands and arms which were put into the path of the ray. The witnesses noticed a strange prickling sensation and sometimes a slight warmth. Occasionally the rays or invisible fields which were contained in them appeared to cause strong mechanical effects — there are reports of cars being stopped, witnesses being thrown (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"(German Conference, Continued) to the ground, or even persons or objects raised or pulled into the UFO. Electromagnetic disturbances are found as well in connection with these \"Solid Lights.\" It is remarkable that animals in general show no signs of panic when exposed to such light phenomena. On the other hand, a series of psychological and psychic aftereffects are often observed in human witnesses. If one classifies 139 typical cases according to the probable purpose of these lights, the following picture results: in 41 percent of the cases, the rays were clearly used as a defensive weapon in order to prevent closer approach to the UFO. The rays served for inspection in 28 percent and for transportation in 23 percent of the cases; only in 8 percent of the cases were aggressive intentions unmistake- ably observed, whereby the actual reason remained, of course, unknown. Current physics appears incapable of explaining the phenomena described. It can hardly be a matter of laser radiation in the normal sense, since these always follow straight lines and can't stop in midair. A more interesting hypothesis is that of proton beams as proposed by A. Meessen, professor of theoretical physics at the Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium. Such particle beams in fact do have finite lengths depending on their energy content. As a result of scattering in the air, however, the beam fans out conically at the end, which effect is not observed with the \"Solid Lights\" of the UFOs. In order to produce a beam length of 180 m with a diameter of 3 m, an excitation energy of 170 MeV would be necessary. Simultaneously a current of 30 mA would have to flow to produce an illumination comparable to that of a neon tube (as was observed for instance in the Trancas case). If an observer stands relatively near the end of such a beam, say at a distance of 5 m, there remains an energy of approximately 22 MeV, which results in a penetration depth of 3.5 mm into the skin. Under these circumstances, third degree burns would have to have occurred. The calculation becomes dramatic, however, when one looks at Physicist W. Bucher discussing \"solid light\" cases. the radiation damage: In one second, the witness would have obtained a dose of 10 to 50 million REM — a value which otherwise occurs only in thermo- nuclear explosions. Radiation doses of over 500 REM are already sufficient to cause incurable damage. In view of these quantitative results, whose orders of magnitude remain essentially the same on variation of the assumed input data, proton beams can be ruled out as an explanation of solid light phenomena. Above all, however, they leave the often observed gravitational interactions unexplained. A light ray which acts as a lift and sucks up objects should more probably be connected with contrabaric effects in the sense of Heim's \"Unified Quantum Field Theory.\" The unbelievable reports on the properties of the UFO light phenomena call forth the boldest of speculations. Perhaps, thus the opinion of Dipl.-Phys. I. Brand, the foundations for a qualitative explanation of some of the strangest of the UFO phenomena can be derived from several theoretical consequences of this new theory. The world model according to Heim (a non- linear 6-dimensional quantized geometrodynamics), which Brand discussed in a detailed lecture, is a formalism capable of describing such varied phenomena as elementary particles, biological, psychological, and paranormal phenomena by cascades of geometrical structures and information levels within the context of a general logical calculus. Dipl.-Phys. Burkhard Heim had already presented several results of this 30-year project in Innsbruck in 1978 at the \"Imago Mundi\" conference. The theory contains Einstein's relativity theory as well as quantum mechanics as special cases. Whereas Einstein interprets the space-time-structure- evolutiori as a consequence of the matter present in the universe, Heim's theory deals with an evolution of structure quanta independent of matter. The two additional coordinates are imaginary controlling organizations of matter states. These \"entelechal\" resp. \"aeonic\" world 'directions' are principles in the timelike coordinates of the 5th and 6th dimension. All material bodies are \"condensations\" of some fundamental metric tensors. Because there are only area quanta (metrons) these are not genuine tensors but rather \"selectors\" according to Heim. Parallel to the metron theory which yields a \"mass formula\" for the calculation of all the properties of elementary particles, Heim has developed a completely general system of formal logic capable of describing statements about quantitative relations (i.e., mathematical aspects) as well as those concerning qualities (organi- zation pattern and information, for example). Complex concept structures which are built up from simple logical connectives form so called \"metroplexes.\" These constructs are, so to speak, the continuation of material structures into the 5th and 6th dimensions of the world. They are practically \"ideas\" or information patterns which, although they do not appear directly in our space, can, under certain conditions, displace the probability states therein for statistical processes if these condensations of the *5 and X 6 structures (gravitons) intersect our space-time. We experience such processes, for instance, as psychokinesis. If such information patterns affect the various metroplexes of an object, then the probability distribution of the macrostructure or microstructure will change. The very small energy required"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"for such an entropy reduction can, for example, be extracted from the surroundings. An advance technology, as to be assumed in the case of UFOs, must be capable of controlling such phenomena. According to Brand, a future \"metatechnology\" should also possess the ability of transmitting streams of information into the metaregion and synchronistically coupling them to prescribed similarity structures. Then projections would appear at certain predictable locations in the space-time continuum which could assume the most varied forms and trigger a variety of physical and paranormal effects. If such a \"syntropode channel\"* were to transfer organization patterns of the surroundings into which it submerges back to the starting point, one would have an ideal information transfer system. Some UFOs, according to Brand, could be interpreted as the appearance in our world of the projected tip of an informational \"tentacle\" stretched across the parallel spaces and originating at a position in the cosmos arbitrarily distant from us. As unconventional as such an explanation may appear at first sight, it appears all the more reasonable when we consider the sometimes bizarre shapes and patterns reported occasionally of the UFOs and their occupants. Above all, however, the mutability of the forms similar to Foo-fighters, which become larger and smaller and sometimes even transparent, speaks for the applicability of this theoretically conceivable projector model to UFO and Psi phenomena. According to this theory it is to be expected in addition that the information patterns projected onto our space-time will appear, as visible forms because of the insuppressible energy radiation. Naturally such \"objects,\" which would give the illusion of completely solid material bodies, could not be captured or destroyed. Machine gun or cannon shots would leave them unaffected. There are numerous examples of frightened witnesses to UFO landings who shot at the occupants without their having taken the least note-of it. On the other hand it must be possible on the basis of such \"telekinetic technology\" to teleport (or abduct) matter. For this it would be sufficient to suitably influence the corresponding organization variable of the metadimensions. An object under the influence of the \"syntropode channel\" which changes the probability states of matter would, for example, collapse into itself in a fraction of a second and just as quickly — materially — appear at another location. I. Brand conjectures that UFOs can be either spaceships which can travel \"faster than light\" according to the Heim-Lorentz-transformation in six dimensional' space or 'stationary projector devices or rather shape ships with projecting apparatus on board. Thus can the often observed phantoms, the melting of solid objects, the vanishing into thin air as well as fireballs and \"Solid Lights\" be explained. The syntropode channels should also have the unpleasant property of affecting the human psyche and triggering telepathic phenomena as well as other parapsychological effects. It even appears conceivable that it has already been possible elsewhere to inhibit optical and thermal effects at the nozzle of the \"information hose\" entering our region to such an extent that our world could be viewed and listened into from the other end (\"world tapping\") without its becoming known to us. It could thus be explained, for example, why UFO formations sometimes appeared on radar screens without having been perceived optically. To be sure, such possibilities smack today sufficiently of the absurd, but we recall the comment of Arthur C. Clarke to the effect that the technology of tomorrow will hardly be distinguishable from magic. Whatever the case may be, there are indications for the validity of the projector theory. After all it is a theoretical consequence of Heim's unified quantum field theory, which to date is the only theory that predicts all properties of elementary particles such as mass, lifetime, charge, spin, isospin, and strangeness in a unified and completely consistent manner. The first volume of the unified field theory of Heim will appear shortly in English in the Springer series. MUFON 103 OLDTOWNE RD.

Dculey (Editor's Note: MUFON has no official position as to whether cattle mutilations are in fact related to UFO activity, but monitors the data and keeps an open mind on the subject. At least some reports have linked mutilations and UFO sightings by approximate time and location. The steps taken to conduct a more thorough investigation are praiseworthy. Mr. Deuley attended the hearings and filed this report.) On April 20, 1979, Senator Harrison Schmitt of New Mexico co- sponsored with Mr. R. E. Thompson, U.S. Attorney for New Mexico, a public hearing on the cattle mutilations that have occurred in New Mexico over the past several years. The hearings were conducted in the Albuquerque, N.M. Public Library before an audience of over 200 people. The hearing was informal in that it did not have any power to cause actions. It was sponsored for the purpose of bringing together a wide variety of persons who had had experience with cattle mutilations. The speakers came from a wide geographical area and represented just as wide a variety of backgrounds. Statements were made pro and con as to the existence of a real problem, with the general • conclusion an apparent need for much more investigation, cooperation, and coordination. The scope of the problem was well covered with general agreement among the participants that some form of positive action must be formulated. Just such plans for positive action were announced at the hearing: a request for a grant from the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA) had been made by the State of New Mexico. Within one week of the hearing the grant was approved allowing for the hiring of a dedicated investigator. 8 Senator Schmitt opened the hearing with a prepared statement emphasizing his concern that unpunished criminal acts in the form of animal mutilations had no doubt taken place in New Mexico over the past several years. His greatest concern was that because a great many of these acts had been perpetrated, leaving no clue as to who may have done this damage, the number of incidents and the amount of damage could rise sharply without the public, the rancher, or law enforcement personnel being able to do anything about it. Senator Schmitt closed his remarks by expressing the hope that this public hearing would define the scope of the problem and open the way to a solution of these brutal crimes by drawing in the assistance of the FBI, other state agencies, and agencies from adjoining states. Senator Schmitt introduced a list of eleven speakers and solicited the audience for anyone who felt they could add to these proceedings. During the course of the session, several individuals responded to this invitation to speak. The speakers included UFO researcher Dr. Richard Sigismond and UFO/mutilation researchers Tom Adams, Tommy Blann, and David Perkins, all MUFON investigators. There were also veterinarians, law enforcement personnel, professional research scientists, and those with the greatest concern, the rancher and Indian officials who have had personal contact with the mutilations. The UFO and mutilation investigators, and some law enforcement personnel, gave some examples of some of the more bizarre cases. The private researchers each pledged to make their files and records available to law enforcement personnel, and further each, in general, encouraged vigorous investigation of these baffling incidents, which, in their opinion, seem to defy all reasonable explanation. One of the thrusts of the hearing was to show that these crimes are not isolated in New Mexico but are spread out over many states. The idea was that this fact alone should require the FBI to become involved. This was found not to be the legal situation. However, FBI Agent in Charge of the Albuquerque office, Forest Putman, conceded that due to the fact that some of the mutilations had occurred on Indian lands, the FBI. had jurisdiction to investigate and to apply their capability to this mystery. Some professional scientists who had been officially involved in mutilation cases pointed out that they had never seen any evidence that they considered strange and that in most every case the mutilations seemed to be the work of natural predators. Law enforcement personnel and mutilation investigators countered this argument with several documented cases that fully established numerous situations demanding much more investigation. Mr. Carl W. Whiteside of the Colorado Bureau of Investigation went statistically through some thirty cases that his state had investigated. He concluded that there were more than just a significant number of cases that remain with no apparent solution. He warned that should the FBI and the State of New Mexico decide to put time, money, and people into attempting to clear up these crimes, they must accept and appreciate the fact that even a great deal of resources may bring little toward answering the questions surrounding these cases. Mr. Whiteside further stressed that because so little is known, it is absolutely necessary to keep an open mind and maintain a willingness to apply imagination, intuition, and a lot of (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"(Mutilation Hearings, Continued) very hard work. Senator Schmitt closed the hearing by thanking all of the participants for appearing and by summing up with the hope that this might be the beginning of a close cooperation among the various state, local, federal agencies, and private organizations and individuals, to bring together the information necessary to solve the mutilation crimes. After the hearing, a press conference was held that allowed for a great deal of local and state news, and for some publicity to the effect that at least one aspect of the UFO phenomena will get an official look. During these proceedings, Mr. John Remming of the New Mexico Criminal Justice Department revealed that his office had requested $50,000 from the LEAA for the purpose of looking into these crimes. On April 25 it was announced on Albuquerque television that $44,000 was granted and that Mr. Ken Rommel of the Santa Fe FBI office was contracted as the state's primary investigator. Mr. Rommel retired from the FBI on May 25, 1979, and will assume the duties of the state's mutilation investigator the following week. He stated that he would approach this investigation just as he would any case he had ever worked on in the past; that is, he intends to use the best available investigative techniques and instrumentation. When asked of his approach to the UFO claim, he stated that if UFO occupants were at fault he would bring them in by their little green ears. Although Mr. Rommel was joking with his remark, it may show signs of his not being aware of the advice of Mr. Whiteside, the Colorado investigator mentioned earlier, who warned of the frustration which anyone investigating these cases may have to face. It will be enlightening in the future to hear follow- up statements by Mr. Rommel. The hearing was interesting, if not necessarily meaningful to UFO research. The outcome of the actions taken after this hearing will be worth following because they may be the first steps toward the scientific study of contemporary unusual phenomena. UFO POLL Dr. Dan J. Duke, psychology professor at Appalachian State University at Boone, N.C., conducted a UFO poll of both male and female students in his psychology classes in response to this statement: \"Some say that UFOs may be extraterrestrial visitations, that is, space probes from other planets in our own or from other planetary systems.

FIRST LONDON INTERNATIONAL UFO RESEARCH CONGRESS The British UFO Research Association (BUFORA) is sponsoring a 2-day International UFO Congress Sunday, August 26, and Monday, August 27, 1979, at the Mount Royal Hotel in London. Planned speakers include Dr. J. Allen Hynek, J. Bernard Delair, and Norman Oliver. About 8 main papers or talks will be presented, and there will be displays and a bookstall. BUFORA previously sponsored national conferences at Stoke-on-Trent in 1975, at Birmingham in 1976, and at Nottingham in 1978. Now it proposes to hold the first international UFO conference to be convened in England. Its publicity material states: \"Behind the scenes leading researchers will try to thrash out a common policy on terminology and classification, data processing and software, with a view to recommending a system of standards, that if endorsed by the Congress, would carry sufficient weight to attract international recognition.\""},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"POSSIBLE ABDUCTION IN NEW YORK STATE By Budd Hopkins On Friday, November 7,1975, two young Brooklyn men (Vincent L. -and John D.) drove into the Catskill Forest Preserve (about 100 miles northwest of New York City—see map) for an off- season, weekend camping trip. It was raining heavily when they arrived and the overnight areas were almost v deserted, abandoned by campers and rangers alike. To keep dry the two men pitched their tent under a rough, wooden picnic shelter, a structure' ;.., consisting of four columnar supports ••?.*.'.. and a high roof. Sometime around 1:00 AM they were awakened by sounds coming from the garbage can. (Afterwards they noted that they had found themselves unusually and simultaneously wide awake.) As John prepared to frighten off the animals presumed to be exploring the garbage, he unzipped the tent and put his flashlight on the ground outside; the instant this happened the ,. tent interior became darker, and both men realized that something akin to moonlight had been shining through the semi-translucent tent walls. The men stepped outside but saw nothing. This in itself was unusual since there was no animal near the can and no animal tracks anywhere on the muddy ground. (The men had assumed their visitor was a raccoon, but fearing the possibility that it had been a bear they were anxiously searching for tell- tale tracks.) While moving the garbage can farther away from their tent they heard a strange \"sonar-like sound\" passing back and forth above them, which they presumed, in the darkness, to be some kind of bird. They noticed back in the woods nearby what looked like a \"streamlined camper-trailer\" and which they immediately assumed had been the source of the lights and sounds. Some campers had arrived, they decided, and after a moment John headed into the woods to get a closer look. He had gone barely a few yards when he realized that this was no ordinary camper-trailer; it had a smooth, irregular shape, a mast at one end with some kind of spinning unit mounted to it, but most surprising of all, its entire surface appeared to be faintly luminous. Vincent, who was walking behind him, had the same startled reaction at the same time; they tramped back to their shelter and sat down, trying to convince one another that it could not be what they thought it was. \"There's no such thing,\" John said, \"there's no such thing.\" He was holding the flashlight, which had not been turned off, and in an idle swing to his left, illuminated a figure standing in the woods. This figure, which appeared to be looking at them, was tall and simple in outline, with two large dark \"eyes\" and a series of diagonal slashes or strips on one cheek being the only interruptions in the clear, undetailed shape. Its surface was also faintly luminous. . Thoroughly frightened, John swung the flashlight beam around and picked up three more of the creatures, one of which was apparently in a tree. They were absolutely silent and identical except that the number of fork\" Naw Brunswick \"cheek stripes\" varied. For moments John and Vincent believed these figures were some sort of apparition created by slide projectors, or something like it. It was only when the creatures approached to within 15 feet that they realized they were \"more dimensional\" Drawing of \"wagon-like\" object by John D. 10"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Sketch of landed object by Vinnie L. than a more flat, projected illusion would be. A state of siege ensued. The figures approached and withdrew, approached and withdrew. They moved with incredible ease when one considered the dense undergrowth in the woods. No arms or legs could be discerned within their closed silhouettes, and most mysterious of all, each time the flashlight beam fell upon one of the figures it would stop, remaining immobile until the beam was removed. One three-striped figure which hovered towards the back of the group seemed to control the others; when the light beam fell upon it, all the others were simultaneously immobilized. The two campers were convinced they were going to be kidnapped. Later, when Vincent recounted the nightmarish experience, he said, \"I really thought I was going to die there.\" Brandishing axes, they built up their campfire, realizing that in light and fire they had their only defensive weapon. Their car was parked nearby, perhaps 100 feet away, in a cement parking lot that serviced the picnic area, but both men were too afraid to leave the campfire to make a break for it. Four Duroflame logs had swollen the flames to dramatic proportions, and after a short while the mysterious figures withdrew. John and Vincent had noticed earlier that one of the creatures, way over to their left, had been slowly approaching them accompanied by an apparently hovering flat object that John described as looking like a small, wheel-less covered wagon. Perhaps 30 inches wide by six feet long, it had several hoops running up across its width, and these hoops supported what boked like a transparent, plexi-glass type of cover. All of these descriptions both men insist are as accurate as they can remember, though they underline the fact that they were totally petrified during the encounter. John and Vincent had transformed the various picnic tables and benches around them into a \"kind of Alamo\" in front of their tent. When the creatures withdrew back into the woods, Vincent threw their possessions into the tent, cut the ropes, and raced down to the car to start the engine. John remained under the picnic shelter at the fireside and prepared to photograph the creatures which had at this moment begun to return. Before he had raised the camera to his eye, Vincent shouted for him to put it down — \"They'll think it's a weapon\" — and John complied. Everything was now in the car and they were ready to flee. John dumped some water on the stack of flaming logs; the fire sputtered out, and at that moment the figures rushed towards the campsite. John went down the stairs \"six at a time\" to the parking lot below, but there was a problem with the car's engine. Vincent recalls that at first the motor almost died, then surged forward, \"the wheels leaving rubber,\" but John remembers \"the battery going dead\" and the car not starting immediately. Above the obviously panicked memories, it is clear that the car did not perform as it should have. Moments later, John and Vincent raced out of the park, heading for home in a state approaching abject terror. John recalls a stretch of road marked by small, Drawing of figure by John D. metal-enclosed glass reflectors down the center strip: The moment their headlights picked up the row of glowing spots both men nearly cried out in panic, assuming that their luminous tormentors were still with them. At 3:30 AM they passed through the toll barrier at the New York State Thruway, an hour to an hour and a quarter drive from the scene of their encounter. Since the action had begurr when they awoke at roughly. 1:00 AM ,-. the entire experience had laste'd a\"' minimum of an hour and a quarter. Aftermath Acting on the correct assumption that probably no one would believe then, neither man reported the encounter to the authorities, though they told their parents, their girl friends, and their girl friends' parents. Both John and Vincent were thoroughly shaken by what had happened, and in the week following skipped school classes and more or less remained indoors. Stella, Vincent's fiancee (and present wife) told me that he was \"white as a sheet for days, and Vinnie normally has almost an olive complexion.\" Also, she noticed a day or so after the incident, that on his back there were several diagonal abrasions above one another, which straddled his lower spine. The faint scar marks persist to (continued on next page) 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"(N.Y. State, Continued) this day. John's case is even stranger. He noticed some days after the event a small \"burning\" mark near his navel. It slowly expanded downwards towards the groin, and was consistently painful. As the weeks passed two other similar marks developed in the same region. Eventually he consulted his doctor, but without mentioning the incidents at the campsite. By April, 6 months after his encounter, the condition was sufficiently disturbing for the doctor to send John to the hospital for tests. A. kidney tumor was suspected. A kidney specialist and a dermatologist were brought into the case. An exploratory operation was suggested and eventually cancelled; nothing was ever found to be the cause of the disturbing marks. John was released after 7 days and pronounced perfectly healthy. John, like his friend Vincent, is an honest and direct man of normal intelligence and down-to-earth practicality. There seems to be nothing in any way exotic in his makeup. Yet, at the urging of his girlfiend Maria, he reluctantly told me of another odd feature of the months following his encounter in the Catskill Forest Preserve. He had occasional episodes of absolute clairvoyance. On a shopping spree, for example, he lost his new sunglasses. The next day at work he \"saw\" the salesman in a stationery store they had visited pick up the glasses, slip them into a brown clasp envelope, and put them on the third shelf from the top behind him. He and Maria returned to the store. The salesman who had waited on him was off duty and the new man had not heard of any glasses being turned in. \"Try the third shelf,\" said John, \"and see if there's a clasp envelope. They're in there.\" And they were. These episodes became less frequent, and ultimately ceased altogether. Evaluation I have interviewed Vincent and his wife Stella, and John and his girlfriend Maria, a|l in person. I have interviewed Vincent's brother-in-law by telephone. There is no doubt in my mind that these two young men are reporting, to the best of their ability, what they 12 experienced. I was able initially to interview Vincent and John separately by telephone, so each told me his story twice; no important discrepancies appeared in the accounts — in fact, the separate versions dovetailed perfectly. Their truthfulness is beyond question. Also I believe that they probably were abducted, the abduction taking place either be/ore they \"awoke\" in their tent at the very beginning of the siege, or afterwards, from their car which had difficulties achieving power for the escape. The marks on their bodies, of course, are a strong indication of a probable abduction. Both men independently entertained the idea that they were taken, because of these physical traces as well as subsequent dreams and apparent flashbacks. Vincent has a recurring image of himself lying on some sort of table and looking over his right shoulder through a round window to what appears to be earth below. John, while in his hospital bed, experienced unusual fear when a nurse bent down over him foi a routine check. On another occasion he had a flashback of being \"picked up,\" a rare experience, he points out, for a tall man who weighs 245 pounds. . Neither witness is particularly versed in the UFO literature. After their encounter John purchased and read the Blum's Beyond Earth and Hynek's The UFO Experience, while Vincent was frightened enough not to want to hear or read anything on the subject. Neither man has ever sought publicity of any sort; on the contrary, each insists on complete anonymity. Vincent is an automobile salesman and John is employed by a large insurance company in Manhattan. Future Investigation Ted Bloecher and I discussed the idea of hypnosis with both men. Each wants to find out what, if anything, he is presumably unable to remember, but each is afraid of hypnosis per se. We postponed any 'decision in the matter after offering them the possibility to meet and talk with .the hypnotist without any obligation to undergo hypnotic regression, to this they appear receptive.

Bloecher and myself, to photograph the location and look for any ground traces, since prior to their seeing the glowing object on the ground, before they emerged from their tent, they had heard sounds of tree branches snapping. Also, we intend to interview John's doctors. One very interesting final point should be made: This Catskill incident occurred in a time of high UFO activity. Five abduction cases have been reported within the 13 day period from October 27 to November 8, 1975, including both the Travis Walton, and Poland Springs, Maine cases.

Leet (Copyright 1979 by William D. Leet) As so many UFOs are reported to be, this one was really \"foxy.\" To say in the vernacular that it was \"playing \"possum\" is no exaggeration. The time was July 18,1952, in the heat of the war in Korea, that I had the privilege to witness the marvel and tremble at its awesome performance. To this day I am consoled that other men saw it too, not only because shock, like misery needs company, but because of the acute interest in the event by the government...twenty-seven years ago. Tokyo, Japan gets hot in July and Tachikawa Air Base, 17 miles to the west where I was stationed, was even hotter as the busiest airport in the world. I recall reporting to the 21st Troop Carrier Squadron Operations the morning of July 18 in my cotton khaki uniform and sweating, not knowing that I soon would be in a cold sweat. My primary duty was in the Legal Office and I did not fly often, only once every week or two. I had not been checked out as aircraft commander on our C-54 Skymaster — a veteran cargo and passenger airplane of WWII and the Berlin Airlift — and flew this day as co-pilot with Lt. Arblaster on a routine mission with several stops in Japan and Korea, carrying troops, mail, and freight. I do not remember Lt. Arblaster's first name, but recall that he was a nice looking blond, young fellow, conscientious and'eager to accomplish the mission without a hitch. I don't remember the name of the flight engineer either, but they both saw what I saw — and I'm sure their names are in the same folder as mine in a file in Washington. There was another witness to the apparition. We took off from Tachikawa to the south, heading toward Oshima, a tiny island in Tokyo Bay that had a radio beacon and was the aerial entrance and exit for greater Tokyo. Arblaster was intent on maintaining a 180 degree course, and rate of climb of 500 feet per minute. I was monitoring the flight instruments, and with the engineer the engine instruments, but reveling to be aloft again I was stealing glimpses of Mount Fuji and lower mountains to the west. The clouds were in distinctive strata or layers, and my glance caught something that made me do a \"double- take.\" . In a perfectly smooth layer of cloud I saw a trough. Had Michaelangelo sculpted the trough in marble it could not have been more symmetrical and clearly defined. It was rectangular but the lower corners were gently rounded, and in the center was a cloud shaped like a perfect sphere! But clouds are never shaped like balls, I knew, and stratus clouds never have geometric troughs carved in them. Neverthless, I was looking at the trough, and the perfect circle the same shade of grey as the clouds. I should point this out to Arblaster and the engineer, I knew, but did I really know what I was seeing? I was a victim of the UFO-witness dilemma. Of course I knew what I was seeing, but what I was looking at was impossible. And nobody wants to make a fool of himself. I decided to study the absurdity for one more complete minute before calling it to the 'other men's attention. I silently suspended my co-pilot duties and fixed my stare on the out-of- this-world weirdo. Neither the grey globe nor its delineated trough wavered. During the 60-second confirmation, my memory leaped back to November 24, 1944, when my B-17 crew and I were accosted by a Foo- Fighter on a Lone .Wolf mission over Austria. Our Army Intelligence, notified by flight crews of numerous Fqo- Fighter (UFO) encounters, did not see fit to relay the vital knowledge to the. rest of us flying men. One result was the awe and confusion experienced by my B-17 crew and me when the Foo- Fighter joined our plane for a 50-minute fly-a-long. If I had permitted the gunners to shoot the Foo Fighter, as they wanted to do, it may well have been impervious to our 50 calibers while quite capable of destroying pur Flying Fortress. Another unfortunate result of Intelligence's taciturnity was the loss of any contribution to the understanding of UFOs we might have made if we had been supplied the information already acquired. Now, 7 years later, although I had learned nothing more about UFOs than a vague impression from reading Air Force Regulation 200-2 which ordered us to report them, I resolved to glean every detail about this unnatural sphere I was observing. After assuring myself that what I was watching was not impossible — that the object was every bit as real and sure as majestic Mount Fuji, and knowing that it was neither man-made nor earthly natural — I pointed it out to the flight engineer, who was seated next to me. He studied the object and scooped-out cloud intensely for a couple of minutes, looked at me saying, \"What in the hell is that?,\" and got back on his job. Arblaster was busy as a bird dog piloting the big Troop Carrier aircraft, but he glanced at the wonder for a few seconds, straining to look across the engineer and me and out my window on the right side of the cockpit while holding the Skymaster on a precise course and climb. At this time, a lieutenant came into the cockpit and at my indication watched the object and took several pictures of it with a small camera he was carrying. He wore navigator's wings and I, not well versed in Troop Carrier operations, assumed that he was a member of the crew. I asked him for, - and he agreed to let me have, prints of (continued on next page) 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"(Korean War, Continued) his photos but I later learned that he was not on the crew. He was one of the \"R & R's\" — men stationed in Korea who periodically got a few days respite in Japan for rest and recuperation — and was a passenger on the flight. I did not know his name or airbase and never saw him again, and of course did not receive prints of the pictures he took, but the image of the apparition is inerasably filmed in my memory. A glance at my watch told me that we had been viewing the UFO for 7 minutes, during which time it had hung motionlessly in the center of its demarcated trough. I was astounded to see it change its shape! From a circular form it instantly flipped into one that was elliptical, just as a magician would transform a basketball into a football! And in the same few seconds of time it takes to tell you this the UFO flew toward the west and beyond our range of sight! How foxy can you get? Arblaster didn't see the conversion of the UFO and its near-instantaneous flight into disappearance, but I'm reasonably certain that the navigator and engineer saw it with me. We continued our mission, making several stops at bases in Japan and Korea both ways, and landed at Tachikawa about midnight. The next morning, after resting and recovering from the tiring mission and uneasy experience, I went to Group Intelligence to report the UFO sighting. The reception I got was one of righteous indignation. \"Why didn't you report the UFO to Ground Control Intercept?\" the captain demanded to know. \"GCI scrambles F- 94 fighters to intercept UFOs the moment they're sighted. Why aren't you informed on APR 200-2?\" I told him that I knew the provisions of the regulation, and that it required flight crews to report UFO sightings after landing. There was an amendment to 200-2, he said, ordering that GCI be called immediately if UFOs are sighted. I told him I had not seen that amendment, but the Intelligence officer said that made no difference — I was bound by it anyway. It had not been distributed but all personnel were required to know its provisions. I told him that if he wanted to initiate any punitive action founded on such idiocy, to come and see me at the Legal Office. No more was said about that, but Arblaster and the engineer were called in at once. We were put at separate desks and told to write descriptions and draw a diagram of what we had seen. \"A board of generals in Washington is waiting to see this,\" the Intelligence officer told us. I was the first to finish and, the captain having stepped out of the room, looked over their shoulders to see as well as I could what Arblaster and the engineer had done. The diagrams they had drawn were remarkably similar to mine. I was surprised to see that Arblaster's drawing and mine, showing the sphere in the trough, were so alike since he had such a limited view of it. I didn't attempt to read their descriptions of the scene and related action, but noticed that both wrote about half a page. I didn't fly on another mission with the flight engineer and I don't remember seeing him again. It was war, there were 7,000 Americans on the base at Tachikawa; or he could have been shuffled off to another base or Korea, or rotated to the States. Two or three nights after the memorable flight, I was having a beer at the Officers Club when Arblaster appeared next to me at the bar. He was not exactly pleased with me. Men in war are as lavish with rumors as they are with their money on payday, and a rumor must have gotten home to him that was not too complimentary of his sanity. I knew how he felt — since our UFO confrontation some of the smiles in my direction bore an element of leers and smirks, as though I had slipped my trolley. \"Why did you want to stir up this hornet's nest?\" Arblaster demanded in a question that sounded like an accusation. The expression on his face was that of a serious man who is undergoing taunts and harassment. I know today that the young lieutenant was enduring the second dilemma of the UFO witness: whether he should hold true to the reality of his perception, or hoist the white flag in his ordeal of derision. \"We were required to report the sighting,\" I reminded him, \"and you saw the same thing the engineer and I saw. Are you saying now that you didn't see it?' Lt. Arblaster had been looking down at the bar, but now he was directing his eyes straight at mine and I sensed that he would not retract the true statement and diagram he had made. Still, I was sorry for him in his lonely quandary. If our sighting had occurred today, I could have told him that the latest Gallup Poll discloses that 17 million Americans report seeing UFOs, and I'd have supplied much more explanatory data. Despite official efforts over 30 years to conceal the truth, these facts would have subdued his conflict. In 1952, unfortunately, my knowledge of UFOs was limited to the little gained from the WWII Foo-Fighter exhibition, so I was not of much help. A benighted policy had done harm to a fine young flying officer, and probably to others. More damage than that was committed. The UFO may have been foxy by trying to look like a cloud, but there was nothing foxy in the beclouded heads that were suppressing UFO intelligence, and obstructing our nation's comprehension of the phenomenon.

By Patricia McMahon (Editor's Note: Ms. McMahon is a MUFON Field Investigator Trainee in Annapolis, Maryland. She submitted a well-researched 13-page report reviewing the evidence in the famous Betty and Barney Hill abduction case of September 19, 1961. 1 The two key pieces of evidence supporting the case, she says, are the Marjorie Fish star map 2 and a radar tracking that coincides with the sighting. We have excerpted her comments about the little-known radar sighting and her conclusions.) The second key piece of evidence supporting the reality of this incident is a USAF radar tracking of an unidentified target which apparently coincided in time and place with the Hill's visual sighting. Books, magazines, and one television movie so far have commented on the Hill sighting. Yet, I know of only one media reference to the radar tracking. It is, perhaps, the most neglected aspect of this incident. A television dramatization of this sighting appeared on the NBC network a few years ago. A couple of months prior to its appearance the National Enquirer printed an article concerning this movie and the Hills' sighting. The following statement was made: NBC-TV takes no position on the authenticity of the Hills' claimed experience. But it points out that in 1970 the Air Force released confirmation of radar trackings of a UFO which was believed to have landed in the White Mountains at the very moment the Hills were driving through the area — and which was later picked up on radar taking off. 3 It is this statement that first informed me of the radar tracking, and it is the only time I have ever seen the radar tracking mentioned in any publication. If one visits the Blue Book files, however, one will find that the Hill sighting did coincide in time and place with an airborne radar unit tracking of an unidentified blip. But this is all that is said about the radar report. Nothing further concerning the maneuvers or nature of the radar target is recorded in the Blue Book files. This is extremely inadequate. But then, so is. the Air Force conclusion that the radar echo was the result of atmospheric temperature inversion. While temperature inversions are known to cause radar beams to strike the ground and return false signals, the anomalies are well known to radarmen. There are procedures used to check such spurious .targets. 4 In this case where the radar target was viewed visually, temperature inversion is not a factor. Certainly, it is not a coincidence that the radar UFO and visual UFO occurred simultane- ously. Indeed, the visual sighting confirms the radar tracking and vice versa. The visual sighting is not related to any atmospheric phenomena. As a safety check, I would like to have reviewed the radar report myself. However, as I have mentioned, it is not to be found in the Blue Book files. I have looked elsewhere for documentation on this radar tracking without success, even going so far as to contact the.executive producer of the UFO INCIDENT/the television movie mentioned previously. When I read in the May 1978 MUFON UFO Journal that the Air Force has not released UFO sightings that have generated CIRVIS reports, I inquired anew. 5 Since this was a military radar sighting of a UFO, it seemed likely to have generated a CIRVIS report. I wrote to the Air Force Chief of Community Relations on November 19, 1978, inquiring about the nature of CIRVIS reports and their classified status. I also asked if this particular sighting generated a CIRVIS report. On December 13, 1978, Colonel Albert W. Schumann, Deputy Chief of Community Relations, replied in part: Communication Instructions for Reporting Vital Intelligence Sightings (CIRVIS) reports are used to document various sightings of unexplained or unusual events; thus they are sometimes started by UFO sightings. CIRVIS messages report information of vital significance to the security of the United 1 States and Canada and their forces, which in the opinion of the observer, require very urgent defensive and/or investigative action by the Armed Forces. Due to their sensitive nature, many CIRVIS reports are classified and not released to the public. Unfortunately, I am unable to explain the missing radar report in the Blue Book files that you checked. As you suggested, the sighting in Lincoln, New Hampshire, may have generated a classified CIRVIS report. If so, it will now be impossible to determine since the North American Air Defense Command (NORAD) purges its files every three years, and the sighting in Lincoln occurred 17 years ago. This reply leads one to believe that the complete set of details on this radar tracking are no longer in .existence. However, the fact remains that a simultaneous radar tracking is documented in the Blue Book files. In Conclusion For the past 30 years UFO research has been bogged down in arguments over .which of a superabundance of theories most plausibly accounts for the UFO phenomenon. It is not possible to decide which theory holds the answers until each is tried and tested in the conventional scientific manner that has served mankind so well in this technological age. It is time, therefore, for each and every UFO researcher to turn his attention to seeking evidence acceptable for scientific study of this phenomenon. For example, here is the Hill sighting.

Wayne Laporte (Once again our guest writer from North Carolina, Wayne Laporte, offers a concise solution to a problem faced by all UFO investigators. It is a problem, too, which puzzles most UFO witnesses.—AD) One of the important items that a UFO investigator should determine during an interview is the UFO's \"apparent size.\" This differs from \"true size\" in that it is an estimation of, the angular size of the object, as seen from the witness' viewing position. Knowledge of apparent size helps the investigator mentally visualize how big the object looked to the witness and also may enable calculation of the UFO's true size. The following formula can be used to calculate the actual length or diameter of the UFO: UFO length = (.009235) times (UFO distance) times (K). \"UFO distance\" is line-of-sight distance to the UFO. \"K\" is the ratio of the object's apparent size relative to the apparent size of the full moon. This formula is derived from the basic formula relating proportional distances with .009235 being the constant derived by dividing the moon's diameter of 2,160 miles by its distance of 238,857 miles. The UFO, distance is determined by dividing the distance to that spot on the ground over which the UFO was seen by the cosine of the angle of - elevation of the UFO. Determining the ground distance is frequently a problem, because most people cannot accurately estimate line-of-sight distances. However, it may be that the witness was able to establish the UFO as being over a specific object on the earth. For example, the UFO may have passed low over an electrical transmission tower or cast a light on a building. 16 It may be that two witnesses at two nearby locations saw the same object at the same time. If so, ground distance can then be calculated by triangulation. Triangulation is accomplished by measuring azimuth bearings (horizontal compass readings) to the UFO from both sighting locales. These bearings are then plotted on a scale map of the area. Where the plotted lines intersect is the point on the ground over which the UFO was seen. Next, scale the distance to this point and divide the scaled distance by the cosine of the elevation angle to determine line-of- sight distance. Determining \"K\" can also be a problem. Many witnesses will mentally recall an apparent size image larger than it actually was. It is important to point out that the apparent size of the full moon at zenith is only as large as an aspirin tablet held at arm's length. To illustrate the concept of \"apparent size\" to a witness, hold an aspirin tablet out at arm's length and compare it to an object on a table or hanging on a wall. The next step is to hand an apparent size chart (See Figure A) to the witness, preferably at the actual scene of the sighting. Point out the scale size drawing of the full moon. Ask the witness to select the appropriate silhouette of the UFO. Then have the witness hold . out the appropriate silhouette at arm's length and select the size which just covers the apparent size of the UFO he is reporting. After the witness selects the correct silhouette size, measure it with a metric ruler. Then determine K by dividing measured size by 9mm (diameter of aspirin tablet). For example, if the measured size is 27, then K is 3 (27mm-:-9mm). If the UFO's apparent size is larger than the biggest silhouette, have the witness hold a tape measure at arm's length. Ask him to pull tape out while at the same time mentally recalling the apparent size of the UFO. At best, the calculated true size is only an approximation. The azimuth, elevations, and apparent size are after- the-fact estimations. The final result will, therefore, also be an estimation. But it may indicate whether the witness saw a UFO the size of a small plane or a 747 jetliner. (Hill Case, Continued) independent evidence support the hypothesis that Betty and Barney encountered extraterrestrials. The radar tracking confirms the visual sighting, and the star map confirms the abduction. Now, if the extraterrestrial hypothesis is correct we must be able to find much more supportive evidence. This must be found through further investigation of UFO sightings in general. (Ms. McMahon then propses several areas of investigation that would make or break the extraterrestrial hypothesis: similar cases of amnesia and possible abduction, reported electromagnetic and other vehicle failures, type of UFOs vs. type of activity, and studies leading toward the ability of investigators to arrive at the site while a UFO is still there.-Editor) REFERENCES 1.

His plea was soundly based. The number of U.S. patents issued per year to U.S. inventors reached a peak in 1971, and has declined steadily since. In the past 10 years there has been almost no growth in the research and development field. In 1975, America's private industry actually employed 43,000 fewer scientists than it did in 1970. One of the problems identified by researchers was the intolerance of individual scientists, writers, and politicians for the individuals that dare to expound on new and innovative ideas. The \"if it wasn't invented here, it can't be invented\" philosophy has stopped or at least delayed vast projects. This problem isn't limited to energy, transportation, and medical research alone. It has been instrumental in delaying solutions to the UFO problem. Too few are the voices urging inventiveness in the UFO field. Stanton T. Friedman has continually reminded us that new inventions are created by doing things differently. And Dr. J. Allen Hynek has so profoundly stated that \"there will be a 21st century science....\" Nevertheless, most individuals with new ideas and techniques concerning UFOs are not stopped by the limitations of our science; rather by the pressures of their peers, the fears of damaged reputations if they dare to be different, and the loss of income if they do not recant. Over the past few months I have noticed articles in fine magazines such as Newsweek and Omni that have completely failed in taking a scientific 18 look at the phenomena. Instead they have, sometimes with tongue-in-cheek, put down the researchers and the witnesses, and contributed nothing to finding a solution. Through the application of professional courtesy, perhaps something of value could have been the result. The solution to this problem seems to be one of personal approach to the situation. An article in the McDonnell Douglas engineering publication Technical Idea Exchange sums it up very well. The remainder of this Tech Note provides a quotation from that article, with comments in parentheses by the author. Traditionally, the term professional courtesy has been used to designate gratis services among those who practice medicine. I think the meaning of the term should be broadened. Even though engineers and scientists may not perform free services for one another the same way physicians do (except in the UFO field), they also need a form of professional courtesy. I am speaking of a public demonstration of mutual respect for one another. No individual possesses infinite wisdom or tias been endowed with universal knowledge. Therefore, exhibitions of professional arrogance are unwarranted and should not be tolerated. Yet public indignities and discourtesies do occur, such as the calculatedly embarrassing question addressed to a speaker and the patronizing or flippant response to a legitimate question. Furthermore, intra-professional undercutting seems to be tacitly acceptable in some areas. And inter-organizational rivalry and petty interpersonal sniping are reflected by explicit or implicit attitudes expressed in self-serving remarks. Professional courtesy should not be a ritualistic repetition of \"Please\" and \"Thank you,\" but an expression of respect, or at least an honest acknowledgement of the ideas, labors, or even the basic individuality of others. A willingness to listen, especially when others appear wrong, is an integral part of communication; it should be practiced among professionals as a matter of course. No idea or person should be written off without adequate audience. I think we can all agree that technical arrogance serves ho one and that mannerisms of ' insult, insinuation, or antagonism are counterproductive. Certainly, they preclude objective evaluation of people and ideas and hamper technological progress. Such attitudes represent a waste of energy, a waste which we can ill afford. I UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE 1 1 The UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE will keep you informed of all the latest United States and World-Wide UFO activity, as it happens! Our service was started in 1969, at which time we contracted with a reputable . international newspaper-clipping bureau to obtain for us, those hard to find UFO reports (i.e., little known photographic cases, close encounter and landing reports, occupant cases) and all other UFO reports, many of which are carried only in small town or foreign newspapers. \"Our UFO Newsclipping Service issues are 20-page monthly reports, reproduced by photo-offset, containing the latest United States and Canadian UFO newsclippings, with our foreign section carrying the latest British, Australian, New Zealand and other foreign press reports. Also included is a 3-5 page section of \"Fortean\" clippings (i.e. Bigfoot and other \"monster\" reports). Let us keep you informed of the latest happenings in the UFO and Fortean fields.\" For subscription information and sample pages from our service, write today to: UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE Route 1 — Box 220 Plumerville, Arkansas 72127"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Lucius Farish In Others' Words A report in the March 27 issue of NATIONAL ENQUIRER states that the Soviet Academy of Sciences has asked Russian citizens to report all unusual sky phenomena directly to the Academy for study and evaluation. (See related article in this isue—Editor.) Another article tells of the many strange events which allegedly have taken place in the \"Triangle of the Damned\" along the Adriatic coast of south-central Italy. A short feature in the ENQUIRER'S April 3 issue reports that more than 7,000 letters to the White House, protesting NASA's refusal to investigate UFOs, have been ignored. Dr. James Harder's research on UFO abductees is presented in the April 10 issue. Dr. Harder claims that many people have had multiple abduction experiences since childhood, with the memories of such experiences blocked out of the person's mind. The April 17 issue reviews Kenneth Arnold's famous \"flying saucers\" sighting of June 24, 1947. The April 3 issue of THE STAR has a report on a UFO film taken near Pease Air Force Base, N.H., which is similar to the much-publicized New Zealand UFO film. The first installment of excerpts from Raymond E. Fowler's new book, THE ANDREASSON AFFAIR, begins in the April 10 issue. This is the detailed account of alleged experiences with UFO occupants, as told by Betty Andreasson. The \"UFO Update\" column is missing from the April issue of OMNI, so it is uncertain whether or not this feature will appear in future issues. However, the April issue does contain a feature on UFO photographs, several of which are dubious, at best. An article by E. A. March in the April issue of FATE suggests that witnesses to UFO \"close encounters\" may be enchanted—literally! That is, the energy emitted by UFOs might cause the percipient to lapse into a trance-like state of altered consciousness. Wendelle C. Stevens' article in the May issue of FATE deals with some 1977 UFO events in the vicinity of Tucson Arizona, involving UFO occupants, \"mystery heli- copters,\" etc. Stevens' articles are always well worth reading. Readers who may have purchased copies of French researcher Jean Bastide's book, LA MEMOIRS DES OVNI, DES ARGONAUTES AUX EXTRATERRESTRES, (mentioned in a previous issue) are advised that M. Bastide has available a list of \"Errata\" for that book. Copies may be obtained from him at: 5, avenue Maurice Blondel, 13100 Aix-en-Provence, France. Lynn E. Catoe's UFOs AND RELATED SUBJECTS: AN ANNO- TATED BIBLIOGRAPHY, originally published in 1969, is now available again in a hardcover edition from Gale Research Co., Book Tower, Detroit, MI 48226 ($24.00). This is definitely one of the better bibliogfaphies that has been compiled and it has been updated to some extent by the inclusion of Kay Rodgers' UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS: A SELECTED BIBLIO- GRAPHY, which was published by the Library of Congress in 1976. The Gale reprint edition has a new Introduction by Leslie Shepard and is very attractively presented. The pricetag is a bit steep, but the book is a valuable research tool for persons desiring to learn just what has been published on the many and varied aspects of Ufology. MUFON—NC. TRAINING CONFERENCE The Tarheel UFO Study Group will be the host for the Third Annual MUFON of North Carolina Training Conference to be held Saturday and Sunday, July 14 and 15, 1979 in the Activity Room of the Hanes Mall Sears Roebuck store in Winston-Salem, N.C.

The evening session from 6:30 to 9:15 p.m. will feature George Fawcett, State Director for N.C.; Sam Jacobson on \"Sound Encounters\"; and Ray Rhein on \"Spaceships of Ezekiel\". The Sunday afternoon program will start at 1:00 p.m. with Sgt. E.G. Baker of the Winston-Salem Police Department discussing \"The Polygraph and its Uses and Limitations.\" He will be followed by Dr. R. Nash on the subject of \"Hypnotism, a Special Tool.\" From 3 to 4 p.m., an analysis of fake or hoaxed UFO photographs will be shown. On the social side of the conference, a reception will be held Saturday evening at the home of Mrs. Jayne Ware at 10 p.m., and on Sunday afternoon at 4:45 p.m. a picnic supper will be hosted by Mrs. Mary Ann Bell. All APRO, MUFON and NICAP members are invited to this conference from North Carolina and the adjacent states, and encouraged to bring interested visitors. 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE by WaltAndnis MUFON's Tenth Annual UFO Symposium will be a memorable event in the lives of those who attended when this message is read by Journal subscribers. It is appropriate that our tenth symposium also marks the first decade of the Mutual UFO Network, Inc. Some of the new high points established this year are (1) largest group of speakers, (2) largest and most comprehensive Symposium Pro- ceedings (226 pages), and (3) attendance exceeding that of any prior MUFON UFO symposium and probably the largest ever conducted of this nature in the world. The success of this symposium must be attributed to the terrific and dedicated work of the Northern California MUFON group headed by their Committee Chairman, Tom Gates, and his close associates James M. McCampbell, Paul Cerny, and Stanton Friedman. Many others served in various capacities on the. symposium committee, for which we are indebted. These industrious people will be acknowledged in the August issue of the Journal, which will feature the 1979 MUFON UFO Symposium for those of you who are unable to attend. Mr. Jean Bastide, 5 Avenue Maurice Blondel, 13100 Aix-En- Provence, France, has been appointed as a Liaison Representative for France. He has specialized in French humanoid cases and is the author of the book \"La Memoire Des Ovni,\" printed in French. Jean has been a frequent contributor to the MUFON UFO Journal during the past few years. Paul B. Jackson, Box 1310N, G.P.O., Hobart, Tasmania 7001, Australia, has volunteered to serve as our State Representative for Tasmania. Paul has been active as head of the Tasmanian UFO Investigation Centre and a MUFON member since 1974. Brent M. Rayries, former State Director for Maine, has been reassigned as the State Section Director in Tennessee for Wayne, Hardin, Decatur, Perry, Lewis, and Lawrence counties. Brent now lives at Route 1, Box 66, Waynesboro, TN 38485, and may be contacted by telephone at (615) 722-9422. He originally joined MUFON in June 1972, being interrupted by a tour in the U.S. Navy. Don B. Burns, 607 North Armour, Wichita, KS 67206, has been appointed State Section Director for Sedgwick and Harvey counties in Kansas, working with Stanley J. Fouch, 9714 Ensley Lane, Leawood, KS 66206, who is the State Director. Don may be reached by telephone at (316) 682-9187. Clive 6. DeLong, 903 Vincent Place, Pflugerville, TX 78660, has volunteered his talent as a Consultant in Physics and Polygraph Examiner. Mr. DeLong received an M.A. in Physics from the University of Texas. He has held numerous high level positions in the aerospace industry where his prime interest is devoted to the gathering of intelligence, analysis, and UFO propulsion systems. Neil Bockman, 511 Apodaca Hill, Santa Fe, N.M. 87501, has become not only a Field Investigator, but also a Research Specialist on Animal Mutilations, teaming up with David Perkins, State Section Director in Colorado, to form AMP (Animal Mutilations Probe). It is with extreme sorrow that we announce the passing of William E. \"Bill\" Daniel on April 7,1979, at the age of 50. A subscriber to SKYLOOK and the MUFON Journal since its inception, Bill worked via telephone and correspondence with all reputable UFO groups, but will probably be missed the most by his close associates in Dallas -^ Bill Dexter, John O. Williams, and Stan Ferguson. His. extensive UFO library will be donated to one of the major UFO organizations by his parents in memory of Bilj. We thank the following foreign correspondents who have submitted UFO sighting reports from their countries. A consistent contributor has been Ignacio Darnaude, Manuel Siurot, 3 Bloque 3 in Seville, Spain, over the past few years with the most material in Spanish. A relatively new organization in Italy has sent us Italian UFO Statistics published in English by \"Limit Scientific Research Center Pioneer,\" Via Cardinale Garampi n. 184, 00167 Rome, Itaiy. The Director is Massimo Pigliucci, and the Contributors are Marco Gilardi and Antonio DiGiovanni. Their reports covered the period from October 27 to December 19, 1978. As announced in the June issue of the Journal, a closed meeting was held on June 23 and 24th with Alain Esterle, Ph.D., the new head or chief of GEPAN (Groupe d'Etudes des Phenomenes Aerospatiaux Non-identifies) from France during the visit in Houston. GEPAN is the UFO study organization within CNES (Centre National d'Etudes Spatialies),' the French equivalent of NASA in the= United States. A separate article is included in this issue of the Journal covering this significant cooperative venture between GEPAN, MUFON, and VISIT. The 1979 MUFON UFO Symposium Proceedings are available after July 15th by sending a check or postal \"money order payable in U.S. funds for $8.00 in the U.S.A. and $9.00 in all other countries to MUFON, 103 Oldtowne Road, Seguin, Texas 78155 U.S.A.
