Deputy Director John Schuessler presented this tribute- in the form of an interesting history of MUFON,'which was also the history of retiring director Walt Andrus, one of MUFON's founders and director from 1970 to 2000. Dr. Linda Corley In the first regular presentation of the symposium Dr. Linda G. Corley of Houma, LA, described her 1981 interview with the late Lt. Col. Jesse A. Marcel, Sr., one of the key figures in the Roswell incident. In addition, Dr. Corley described her research into the symbols found on some of the debris at the crash site, as drawn by Marcel. Following the four-hour cordial interview with Lt. Col. Marcel and his wife Viaud as part of a project for a university class, Corley was shocked several days after the interview to receive a phone call from an almost hysterical Marcel telling her that every- thing he had told her in the interview was a lie, and that none of the material should be used. He kept insisting that she was going to release the interview to the press, despite her assurances that she was not. She scrapped the class project, and the tapes from the interview sat on a shelf several years, even after Marcel died in 1986. Finally, in 1993, she released the tapes to Stanton Friedman, who \"would handle them in an appropri- ate manner-he was someone Jesse thought highly of.\" However, by that time the tapes were almost inau- dible, having been made on an inexpensive portable recorder and not played for years. Eventually, Corley was able to transcribe the tapes, and she became convinced that, as part of history, the 62-page manuscript should be made public. Some of the questions and answers from the inter- view follow. An expanded version is included in the MUFON 2000 International UFO Symposium Pro- ceedings (available from MUFON). What was Marcel's description of the beams he retrieved at the crash site? \"I was the first to handle the stuff.. ..[Jesse Jr.] said they [the beams] looked like 'I beams,' but it wasn't. Jesse didn't have that right to begin with.. ..[The writ- ing] was on a beam. They ranged anywhere from 4 to 5 inches long to 3 or 4 feet long. [Beams] appeared to be wood. It wasn't wood. I took my cigarette lighter and tried to burn some of that. It wouldn't bum.\" Was there a cloth type of debris retrieved at Roswell? \"The material was unusual. Of course the Air Force called it a balloon. It couldn't have been. It was po- rous. It couldn't hold air. The material was fabric. I tried to blow through it. It would go right through it, what looked like balloon material, a cloth. It was a cloth- like material, but also metallic. I even tried to burn it. It wouldn't burn.\" What did Marcel think happened to the debris? \"They [the military] have all that stuff. It's in labora- tories. They have analyzed those things to the nth de- gree. They have studied it. T think they still have it because nothing has ever been let out by the Air Force of any materials that I ever picked up. They had mate- rials there that I had never seen before.\" What did Marcel think about UFOs? \"I think the method of propulsion moves to the fourth dimension. I think when they have the ability to change from the third dimension to the fourth dimension, there is no time. They can be here one second and the next second they could be millions and millions of miles away-light years away.\" Had Marcel revealed everything he knew? \"No, I can't, for the sake of my country. Listen,. I was a trained intelligence officer. Once you do that, it's with you for life....There's a hell of a lot I haven't said....I understand a lot more than I can talk about.. ..Sometimes you talk about these things and they will get a net out after you.\" Corley also discussed her research into the symbols drawn by Marcel, which he said were on a beam in the debris from the crash site. Comparing ancient writings, including demotic hieroglyphs (as on the Rosetta Stone in Egyptian and Greek) and Tironian Notes (Roman), and utilizing Latin translation, Corley translated the se- ries of symbols on the beam roughly as follows: \"To go sail, fly, move—from a point in time to take or carry away from some place—toward first the point or goal at which anything arrives—to be, exist, live, take place, happen and occur—the mouth singing.\" Dr. Colm Kelleher Leading off the afternoon session on Saturday was Dr. Colm Kelleher of the National Institute for Discov- ery Science (NIDS), who described the history and some of the research the organization was doing. NIDS grew out of a desire by Robert Bigelow to create \"a fully funded, fully staffed research organization that was dedi- cated to using the scientific method in approaching the study of aerial phenomena, animal pathology, and other topics,\" according to Kelleher."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 August 2000 MUFON UFO Journal Symposium speakers were on hand at the end of the program to answer questions from the audience. Left to right, Dr. Bruce Maccabee, Stanton Friedman, John Carpenter, Stan Gordon, Gerald Rolwes, John Greenewald Jr., Dr. Linda Corley, Gregory Avery, Dr. Kevin Randle, Dr. Robert Wood, and John Schuessler. One of the members of the board of directors of NIDS is John Schuessler, the new international di- rector of MUFON. A recent UFO case discussed by Kelleher was the Jan. 5, 2000, series of sightings by police officers in western Illinois of an aerial object. This case was also investigated by MUFON, as described in a re- port by Illinois MUFON State Director David Marler in the March issue of the MUFON UFO Journal. NIDS is well known for its investigations into ani- mal mutilations, employing a full-time veterinarian, as well as other veterinarians on call. Kelleher de- scribed an especially interesting mutilation case which occurred in October of 1998. In this case a three-year-old registered polled Here- ford cow was found dead by the owner, who had seen the animal in good health the previous day. The cow's left eye and periorbital tissue were removed, as was part of the left ear. A full necropsy (autopsy), fol- lowed by toxicological, histological and chemical analysis, revealed the following: 1. Both the left periorbital tissue and left ear were removed with a sharp instrument(s), as confirmed by two of the three veterinary pathologists respectively; 2. No evidence of high heat or cautery was ob- tained from these cuts; 3. No signs of struggle, and no tracks were found near the animal; 4. An unusual, formaldehyde-containing blue gel- like substance was found in the eye, the ear, and the anus of the animal. Using headspace gas chroma- tography mass spectrometry analysis, the blue gel- like substance was shown to contain 300-3000 ug/g of 2,6-bis-dimetnylethyl-4-methyl phenol, a synthetic molecule with anti-oxidant and anti-viral properties, as well as contaminants of normal putrefaction break- down products from cow tissue; 5. The animal's heart was shredded, yet its pericar- dium (membrane sac enclosing the heart) was intact; 6. The animal tested positive on two different preg- nancy tests, yet there was no fetus present at the time of the necropsy, and no sign of spontaneous abortion; 7. It is suspected that the cow's blood contained high levels of potassium chloride; 8. The cow had extremely low liver copper levels and low Vitamin A levels; 9. Severe hemorrhaging under the hide around the neck of the animal was observed; 10. The animal was normal for routine bacteriology, virology, and toxicology scans. The totality of the data suggests the animal did not die a normal death. John Carpenter In an update of the case described in the May 1999 MUFON UFO Journal, MUFON Director of Abduc- tion Research John Carpenter reported the capture by a surveillance video camera of the apparent abduction and return of an individual. However, the location of the event and the names of those involved are not known, since the video had been sent anonymously to the producers of a TV program, \"Paranormal Borderline.\" A copy of the tape was given to Carpenter in 1996, and he initially felt the depiction of a man disappearing and returning more than an hour later \"was weird, but it sure did not prove anything.\" It was only when Carpenter took another look at the video, frame by frame, two years later that he became aware of what the camera had captured. The surveillance tape has withstood extensive inves- tigation by Carpenter, as well as security analyst Dr. William Schneid, MUFON photo specialist Jeff Sainio, ground trace and photo specialist Ted Phillips, and com- puter and photo specialist Micah Collins. Carpenter notes that this incident includes key simi- larities to commonly reported abduction elements:"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal August 2000 PageS Missing time (110 minutes) matching the 90 to 120 minutes often reported; victim compelled or drawn out- side (man left what appeared to be regular work area, but it is not known if there was any compulsion); ini- tial bright light at onset of abduction; suddenness; elec- tromagnetic interference (surveillance cameras af- fected); power blackout; return of abductee via light; abductee in fetal, \"rolled up,\" or crouched position when returned; arid abductee reportedly showed physi- ological/emotional responses (victim vomited, snowed fatigue, showed fear, indicated amnesia, seemed dis- orientated, and never returned to work). Because many of the key elements can be seen only by viewing the video frame by frame, because there has been no attempt to gain publicity by those sending the video, and because experts feel the surveillance video is genuine, a hoax has been ruled out. Gregory J. Avery Attorney Gregory Avery, MUFON State Director for Louisiana, shared his photos and research regard- ing the contention that some contrails may actually be chemtrails. Although he has been studying these for more than a year, he is still in the preliminary stages of an investigation as he seeks additional input from ex- perts and determines the best methods of gathering scientific evidence regarding this controversy. Dr. Robert M. Wood MUFON Director of Research Dr. Robert Wood discussed the controversial MJ-12 documents, noting the difficulties in determining provenance and quality, but maintaining that most objections put forth by crit- ics regarding the better documents can be satisfacto- rily answered. Wood spent considerable time answer- ing specific objections regarding document wording, document construction, signatures, psychological war- fare, and credibility of the sources for the documents. These documents, critiques, and answers are much too involved for a short summary, and the reader is referred to Wood's 28-page presentation in the MUFON 2000 International UFO Proceedings, and his article in the March, 1999, MUFON UFO Journal. Dr. Bruce Maccabee Dr. Bruce Maccabee, author of the recently-released The UFO-FBI Connections, used specific cases to show that \"prosaic explanations\" of UFO reports proves \"the fajlure of UFO skepticism.\" Utilizing the prosaic ex- planations of cases by noted skeptic Phil Klass and oth- ers, Maccabee showed how the easy explanations can- not stand the scrutiny of good investigations. Stanton T. Friedman Veteran ufologist and lecturer Stanton Friedman took on two controversial topics in his Saturday evening talk: the Roswell incident and the MJ-12 documents. He began his presentation by setting forth where he stands on each topic. On Roswell: \"As the initial civilian investigator of the Roswell incident, beginning with a conversation with Lydia Sleppy in the early 1970's, then later with Maj. Jessel Marcel in 1978, Walter Haul, and a host of other Roswell witnesses, I have been completely con- vinced by overwhelming evidence that the U.S. Gov- ernment recovered wreckage of at least two crashed alien flying saucers in New Mexico in early July, 1947.\" Friedman says one crash occurred on the Foster Ranch 75 miles northwest of Roswell, and the other took place about the same time in the Plains of San Augustin west of Magdalena and Socorro. The veteran researcher is less convinced, however, that the late Col. Philip J. Corso's book, The Day After Roswell, was based on fact. \"Conspicuous by its ab- sence,\" says Friedman, \"is any substantiation .of any of the claims,\" and although Col. Corso literally swore that he was a member of the National Security Coun- cil, \"he was never an NSC member and never attended a meeting of the NSC.\" Friedman is also unimpressed with the evaluation of the Roswell incident by commercial airline pilot Kent Jeffrey, who renounced Roswell in a long article in the MUFON UFO Journal in June of 1997. Says Friedman, \"The naivete [of Jeffrey] is mind boggling. [Jeffrey] is very ignorant of how security works.\" On Majestic-12 documents, Friedman says, \"I am convinced that the Original MJ-12 Documents (the Eisenhower Briefing Document dated 18 November 1952; the Truman-Forrestal Memo of Sept. 24, 1947; and the Cutler-Twining memo of July 24, 1954) are indeed genuine and the most important classified docu- ments ever leaked to the public.\" He notes, however, that \"the SOM 1.01 Majestic- 12 Group Operations Manual is still in my gray bas- ket,\" and \"many of a whole host of more recently re- ceived MJ-12 related documents provided by researcher Tim Cooper are almost certainly fraudulent.\" Ted R. Phillips Veteran physical trace researcher Ted Phillips opened the Sunday morning session by discussing the history of researching physical traces at UFO sites, noting that it was Dr. J. Allen Hynek who first got him started in this specialty in the 1960's. By the time of the 1971 MUFON Conference in St. Louis, his files held 257 reports from 18 countries. His current data base contains 2,190 events, \"all worthy of complete investigation.\" He relates that the oldest trace event took place 510 years ago in 1490 when a silvery object passed over a village in Ireland, dislodging a church bell and burn- ing several cows in nearby fields. Phillips, who \"retired\" from UFO research for sev-"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Page 6 August 2000 MUFON UFO Journal William Konkolesky, MUFON field investigator from Michigan and developer of MUFON's new web site (mufon.com), explains to state and regional directors at the 2000 Symposium in St. Louis the expanded features of the site, including a data base of cases and the means to report sightings. eral years following the death of Dr. Hynek, is again active, investigating traces from all over the world. In 1998 he formed the Center for Physical Trace Research. Interestingly, he reports that landing/trace events are taking place at greatly reduced rates since the early 1980's. The period between 1960-1970 was produc- ing one landing/trace event every 13 days. In 1970- 1980 this increased significantly to three per day, but the 1980-1990 period showed a big drop to about three per week, and 1990-.2000 is about the same-still enough to keep Phillips very active. John Greenewald, Jr. John Greenewald Jr., one of the youngest of today's researchers, began programming a specialized web site four years ago at the age of 15. His site, \"The Black Vault,\" contains numerous government documents which he has obtained through the Freedom of Infor- mation Act (FOIA), targeting the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and many other offices and agencies. Although the Air Force has stated that no govern- ment agency had taken an interest in UFOs after 1969 with the closure of Project Blue Book, Greenewald has found the opposite to be true: \"In reality, almost every agency I went to had documentation on UFOs, and, on top of that, much came after 1969.\" Greenewald says he currently has more than 300 open FOIA requests to various government agencies, and \"I learn new ones, new offices, and new branches and new leads almost every day. I cannot even imag- ine how much information the government actually has. I have only started to search a few subjects, and it has quickly turned into 18,000 pages.\" Stan Gordon Another veteran researcher, Stan Gordon, who among many other activities compiled a 92-minute video documentary on the crash of an object near Kecksburg, PA, presented the first session Sunday af- ternoon. Gordon reviewed the Kecksburg case, which involved the sighting of a strange airborne object prior to the crash, an acom-shaped off-gold-colored object partially buried in the ground, securing of the area by military personnel, and the transporting of the object from Kecksburg-possibly to Wright-Patterson AFB. One of the other anomalies that Gordon has dealt with over the years as head of the Westmoreland County UFO Study Group and the Pennsylvania Cen- ter for UFO Research is the entity commonly called Bigfoot. In 1973 in particular there was a wave of UFO and Bigfoot sightings, including large footprints and ground traces, sometimes in the same areas and"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal August 2000 Page? time frames. The most mysterious of these occurred on Oct. 25, 1973, when a Pennsylvania state trooper called Gor- don to report he had returned from a UFO landing site \"with some other strange details.\" Gordon and four other investigators went to the site in Fayette County where the initial report indicated that about 15 people had watched a large round red object hovering low and dropping towards a pasture at about 9 p.m. At the police barracks a farmer's son had reported that he and two neighbor boys had gone to the pasture to investigate. Reaching the location, they saw a dome- shaped object on the ground about 250 feet away which was illuminating the entire area. It appeared to be about 100 feet in diameter, white in color, and emitting a noisy whirring sound. The three then noticed an odd sound like a baby crying, as well as a strange odor. Two tall creatures, ape-like, but walking upright, were observed moving along a fence line. One ap- peared to be at least eight feet tall, while the other was shorter, possibly seven feet tall. They were covered with dark hair and had glowing greenish eyes. Their arms hung below their knees. The farmer's son had taken a powerful 30.06 rifle with him, and was urged to shoot. One of the boys ran away at this point. Ammunition for the rifle reportedly included tracer bullets, and when a second tracer was fired over the heads of the creatures, one of them raised an arm and at the same time the luminous object on th? ground vanished, as did the noise. The creatures turned to move into the woods, and additional shots were fired at them, but they showed no signs of being hit. The two witnesses went to a neighbor's house and called the state police. An investigation by the state trooper revealed an area about 150 feet in diameter which was glowing so much that the officer's flashlight could hardly be seen, and the area seemed to be warm. Farm animals would not go near the area. As the trooper and the farmer's son walked along the woods they heard a noise, and the trooper aimed his flashlight into the woods. The farmer's son claims that the largest of the two creatures was standing ten feet from them, so the witness fired his last shot at the creature, which allegedly rushed toward them as they ran toward the police cruiser. When Gordon arrived at the scene the site had ceased to glow, and had no abnormal radiation present, but animals still refused to go near the circle. As Gordon's assistant, George Lutz, interviewed the farmer's son, the son suddenly emitted an animal-like growl arid threw Lutz and the farmer to the ground. A dog ran toward the son as if to attack him, but then ran off whimpering as the son turned toward the animal. The son was flinging his arms and bellowing forth growls and inhuman sounds before suddenly falling face down. A member of the investigating team reported feeling lightheaded, while another investigator was having trouble breathing as a strong unusual rotten egg or sul- phur odor engulfed the group. Gordon kept contact with the farmer's son for sev- eral years, and this witness said that he had later been visited by a major in an Air Force uniform and a man dressed in a suit. The witness was shown photos of UFOs and Bigfoot-type creatures by the men to see if he could match the photos with what he had seen. He said the two men got him to agree to be hypnotized. Gerald E. Rolwes Jerry Rolwes, MUFON State Director for Washing- ton and Director for Membership, discussed the July 1,1977, sighting of a mysterious object near the Aviano Air Base in Italy. Rolwes previously described the case in the February, 1996, MUFON UFO Journal. This case has also been discussed by Timothy Good in Above Top Secret: The Worldwide UFO Cover-up (1998) and by Jenny Randies in The UFO Conspiracy: The First Forty Years ( 1993). Rolwes notes, however, that these investigators had indicated there was a cover- up of the incident at the base, but his investigation showed no evidence of this. Dr. Kevin D. Randle The last presenter was Dr. Kevin Randle, who has written a number of UFO books and investigated nu- merous topics, including Roswell and other alleged crash sites, animal mutilations, Project Blue Book, and abductions. His topic for the conference presentation was \"The Las Vegas Crash,\" an April 18, 1962, inci- dent that was labeled a meteor by the Air Force, but which testimony by multiple witnesses indicates was something else. Among the findings in this well-researched-but still incomplete-case is the fact that the object was first seen in New York state, moved to the western states, changed direction, created power outages, affected photo electric cells, landed, took off, maneuvered close to the ground, and apparently crashed or exploded near (or on) Nellis AFB not far from Las Vegas. One of the interesting aspects of the case was that the Air Force report separated the events in Utah and Nevada by one day by logging the Utah event in Zulu (military) time and the Nevada event in local time, thus suggesting two separate events on two separate days, though they were in fact within minutes of each other on the same day. The Air Force also suggested that if the sighting was not caused by a meteor, then it might have been a U-2 plane or a balloon, despite obvious evidence that neither fit, and despite the fact that there was no evidence for this."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Page 8     Au e us « 200 °  MUFON UFO Journal New bylaws for MUFON to be voted on by members By Dan Wright Deputy Director, Investigations MUFON Members: At the corporate meeting held in Arlington, VA, on July 4, 1999, the MUFON Board of Directors deter- mined that it was necessary to revise the MUFON bylaws, the rules under which our organization is governed. The bylaws were last revised in 1982 and, given the extensive growth in both membership size and activities since then, no longer reflect the entire scope of our endeavors. A MUFON transition committee was formed to draft new bylaws as well as a strategic plan of operations to begin the 21st Century. Committee members were: Dan Wright (chair), deputy director, investigations; Tom Deuley, corporate secretary; Tom Whitmore, treasurer; Carolyn McNellis, director of fund raising; Herb Prouty, director of legal affairs, and George Filer, eastern regional director. These proposed bylaws have been approved by the current Board of Directors, but under the existing bylaws a proposed revision must be adopted by a majority of the members voting on such a proposal. A ballot is enclosed. Please take the time to vote, as your participation is crucial to this process. Following is a summary of the most important proposed changes in the bylaws. Membership MUFON membership has always been by invitation, and a provision to that effect remains in the proposed bylaws. The organization under this proposal is composed of \"general\" members, who serve in investigative, re- search or managerial roles and have election voting rights, as well as \"associate\" members in other capacities. A new member classification for students is created in order to develop a cadre of associate members under age 18. Persons who subscribe to the MUFON UFO Journal without engaging in a specific function will no longer be shown in the membership count. A provision is added that all persons desiring to join a local, state or provincial MUFON group must also be a general or associate member of the international organization or otherwise subscribe to the MUFON UFO Journal. To preserve the integrity of the membership, a provision is added for the board of directors to remove a general member who engages in conduct deemed detrimental to MUFON. A separately prepared code of ethics will clarify the conduct expected of all members. State and provincial directors have clear authority and responsibility under the proposal to appoint an assis- tant director, section directors, field investigators and other state/provincial officers as well as to reassign persons when necessary. Meetings State and provincial directors will be obligated to provide every general member with an opportunity to meet with fellow members at least twice per year. Investigator training must be conducted either as part of those meetings or separately. The annual corporate meeting of the MUFON board of directors will continue to be held in conjunction with the annual international symposium. Interim board meetings are added in recognition of the broad range of business necessitating the board's attention. Board Composition In the proposed bylaws, the MUFON board of directors comprises positions clearly responsible for policy making. Functional directorships cover the areas of investigations, legal affairs, membership, publications, research and fund raising. Three regional directorships for the U.S. and one for Canada are maintained, while a regional director for Mexico is added."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal   August 2000   Page 9 Board Elections All board of directors positions are subject to election under the proposal. For positions other than interna- tional director or regional director, candidates may be nominated by any state/provincial director or a member of the board. There are no restrictions on who may be nominated. Election is by majority vote of the combined state directors, provincial directors and board members. Regional directorships under the plan continue to be open to state/provincial directors, assistant directors, section directors and members of the board or administrative staff. Election is by plurality vote of the general members in that region. When a vacancy occurs in the international directorship, a search committee will be established to identify qualified candidates. Selection of a new international director will require a two-thirds majority vote of the board. To allow fof both continuity and fresh perspectives on the board of directors, board positions other than the international director and regional director will have three-year terms, with the elections on a staggered basis. Regional directors continue to have staggered four-year terms. The international director serves under a con- tract for a period to be specified in the contract. Shared Authority The proposed bylaws establish a shared arrangement of authority among the state and provincial MUFON chapters, the international director, the board of directors, and an executive committee of the board, respec- tively. State/provincial directors and their chapters are free to elect officers, conduct business and establish an investigative network in whatever manner they choose. The international director serves as the chief executive officer. S/he is responsible for MUFON's involve- ment with other UFO-related organizations, manages the corporate headquarters operations and financial af- fairs, and supervises the state and provincial directors, administrative staff and persons representing MUFON in other countries. The international director is a voting member of the board of directors and the executive committee. The board of directors decides the organization's general policies, oversees major expenditures, and selects the international director. Functional board members have specified responsibilities to advance MUFON's membership, investigations, research, fund raising, publications, and legal affairs. Regional directors represent the general membership and are responsible for assisting state and provincial chapters. The board may create additional board or administrative staff positions to reflect organizational needs. The executive committee consists of the international director, deputy director, treasurer, corporate secre- tary, and a functional or regional director who is chosen annually by the full board and serves as board chairper- son. The executive committee ensures that MUFON policies and strategic plans are carried out, It may react in situations requiring immediate action such as authorizing emergency expenditures or removing a general mem- ber whose actions are harmful to the organization. The administrative staff implement board policies under the international director's supervision. Included on the staff are the editor of the MUFON UFO Journal, coordinators of governmental affairs, international staff, special (sensitive) investigations, and systems (MUFON's website, online UFO database, hardware and software needs). The international director, Journal editor, and systems coordinator are paid positions. Wages or reimburse- ment of expenses may be provided to others at a future time when MUFON's financial structure can afford those disbursements. Research The proposal carries forward the member categories of consultant (requiring a doctoral degree) and research specialist (requiring a master's level degree or equivalent). These persons have the responsibility to initiate research and to participate in group research or offer input on particular matters when requested. The director of research coordinates those activities with the intended purpose of publishing a series of documents on various aspects of the UFO subject."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Page 10 August 2000 MUFON UFO Journal BYLAWS OF THE MUFON/MUTUAL UFO NETWORK, INC.

Filer Director, MUFON Eastern Region Auto chased by UFO in California desert BAKER — On July 1, 2000, two men were travel- ing just north of Baker when they spotted a huge cigar- shaped craft two stories high that was silver or alumi- num in color. It had tall rect- angular lights across the front of it. It was bigger than any air- plane and it's maneuverabil- ity was unbelievable. It was totally silent. One of the witnesses re- ports: \"The craft chased us three times. The last time it chased us nine miles and was only one to two feet above our car as it chased us at speeds of up to ninety miles per hour. \"There was quite a bit of air George Filer pressure of some kind exerted on our vehicle from the craft. It was so strong we could not close the windows all the way. They were being pushed in. We were driving in the open desert where visibility was great and the sky was clear. \"This cigar-shaped craft flew down and actually blocked the road. We were forced to stop. Then it ap- proached us closer. We shut our lights off and it ad- vanced toward us quickly. We then tumed around and fled. The first time it chased us it did so for approxi- mately a half mile at 100 to 200 feet behind us. The second time it got even closer. The third time it came after us and actually stayed right above us. Part of the craft was actually almost touching our vehicle. \"When we arrived at our destination, we heard that there was a report of a UFO near the town where we observed this UFO.\" (NUFORC Note: Peter Davenport stated, \"We spoke with the witness who submitted this report, and we found him to be quite sincere in his description of what allegedly occurred.\") The second witness provides his version of the story: \"We were traveling north on Highway 127 outside of Baker at 3:30 a.m. Brian and I noticed a light in the sky that seemed to disappear within a few minutes. \"Very soon we noticed dim lights on the road ahead, so we pulled over to investigate and tumed the car lights off to see better. Suddenly there were bright lights from the object coming toward us. We turned the car around and started back south on the highway. It followed us for a mile or so and disappeared. \"We weren't happy with that, so we turned around and headed north again. We got maybe a mile when the object appeared over a sand dune mountain and started coming toward us with its lights on. We made a 'U' turn and drove south again. \"We stopped the car so I could take over the driv- ing. When I looked out the driver's window, the ob- ject was flying next to us. It chased us for about a mile and disappeared. \"We again turned around and headed north again. To our surprise it was waiting again, so we immedi- ately turned back towards Baker, driving at speeds of over 90 mph. Brian then asked, 'Where is it?' When I turned to look, it was right on top of us. \"I could see what appeared to be airline engines in the back window. When I looked out my passenger window, I could clearly tell this was no plane, for the bottom of this aircraft was directly above us. It made no noise. I yelled to get us out of here and proceeded to raise the car windows. The windows would not shut for they were bowed in. \"It was very bright inside the car, and at first I thought the panel lights were on, so I reached down to turn them off. This is when we both noticed the lime green glow inside the car. I looked straight ahead and noticed a car coming toward us and yelled for Brian to watch out, when suddenly our ears popped and the object was gone.\" The witnesss claims to have observed similar craft with a comparable modus of operation. Thanks to Peter Davenport, NUFORC. Strange light seen in California HOPLAND — On July 7,2000, John Mini, an acu- puncturist, was driving with his girl friend at dusk near the Indian Reservation. The sky was clear blue, and it was a beautiful day. They saw an extremely bright light shining a light on a home below. They had never seen a light so bright. At first they thought it might be a helicopter shin- ning a million plus power light. They realized there was no sound, and the light was much too large. Sud- denly the light seemed to swirl and it became pinkish and then completely vanished. It left an ionized trail that moved through the air. The ionization trail lasted for thirty minutes. The driver ahead of them also stopped to see the show.

Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars (1.8), in Leo, rises in the ENE about 4:30 AM in mid-September. The ruddy planet closes to within 1 degree of the star Regulus on the 1 6th and 1 7th. The crescent Moon makes a nice triangle with the planet and star on September 25. Jupiter and Saturn can be found high in the S at dawn. Moon Phases: First quarter-September 5 Full moon—September 13 .... Harvest Moon Last quarter-September 20 \\9 New moon—September 27 9 The Stars: The autumnal equinox on September 22 heralds the arrival of the rather dim fall constellations in the E. Nevertheless, it shouldn't be too difficult to find the Great Square of Pegasus in the SE (10 PM). It is as much a symbol of autumn as the Summer Triangle is of summer. The square is large, measuring very roughly 15 degrees on each side. Both seasonal symbols are visible right now at the same time. Pegasus was the famous Winged Horse of mythol- ogy. Several lines of stars that branch from the western side of the square form the head, neck, and front legs of the horse, which is flying upside-down. What looks like the hind legs of the animal is really the adjoining constellation of Andromeda the Princess. The NE comer of the square, the star Alpheratz, actu- ally is the head of Andromeda, while the two strings of stars extending outward form her gown. Recent Water on Mars? Images from Mars Global Surveyor have revealed evidence of recently flowing water on the red planet. Heretofore it was thought Mars had lost most of its liquid surface water several billion years ago. Newly discovered gullies and debris flows' on the slopes of some crater walls appear to indicate the pres- ence of underground water recently discharged on the surface-perhaps in periodic bursts through cracks from repeated build-up and release of groundwater pressure. NASA's Ed Weiler remarked: \"The water could have flowed perhaps a million years ago, perhaps 10,000 [years ago], perhaps yesterday.... If these re- sults prove true, [they have] profound implications for the possibility of life.\" September 23-24 - 37th Annual National UFO Conference, Corpus Christi, Texas.

Part II: By John F. Schuessler St. Louis UFO Symposium The MUFON 2000 International UFO Symposium was held July 14-16, 2000, at the Sheraton West Port Hotel in St. Louis, MO. This was a successful and most enjoyable event. Bruce Widaman and his out- standing team are to be congratulated for the fine job they did planning and hosting the event. I want to personally thank the speakers: Linda G. Corley, Colm A. Kelleher, John S. Carpenter, Gre- gory J. Avery, Robert M. Wood, Bruce S. Maccabee, Stanton T. Friedman, Ted R. Phillips, John Greenewald, Jr., Stan Gordon, Gerald £. Rolwes, and Kevin Randle, for their fine presentations and strong support for MUFON. Thank You to Walter H. Andrus, Jr. For the past thirty years of the thirty-one-year his- tory of MUFON, Walt Andrus has been at the helm in the role of International Director. Walt was the impe- tus behind the very first MUFON UFO symposium, held in Peoria, IL, in 1970, and through his efforts we have had an annual symposium every year since then. This is an enviable record and I want to thank Walt for making it all possible. Walt had another goal as well. He believed it was necessary to communicate monthly with MUFON members, and to make that happen, he has been a staunch supporter of the MUFON UFO Journal and its predecessor SKYLOOK. The July 2000 issue of the Journal was number 387, and nearly every issue of the Journal contained a message from Walt. Some of the other things Walt has done for MUFON may be found in the MUFON 2000 Symposium Pro- ceedings in my tribute to Walt Andrus. Through the good times and the bad times, Walt has always been in there plugging away to keep MUFON active, respected, and sought after. I venture to say that no one could have done it better. When I think of MUFON, I think of Walt Andrus and his wonderful wife Jeanne. I know they will still be actively supporting MUFON well into the future, but I will miss them as the \"first family\" of MUFON. MUFON Transition The next major step is to transition the MUFON Headquarters office and museum to the Denver, CO, area. We are in the process of locating an appropriate headquarters office location and doing the planning for the move. If all goes well it will happen very quickly. The new MUFON bylaws are intended to keep MUFON abreast of the times. We haven't revised the bylaws in several years, and as soon as they are ap- proved by the membership, we will change our oper- ating style to match the new bylaws. Our goal is to maintain normal operations as all this happens. I see this as an evolution, not a revolution. Some of the changes you will see includes the MUFON Board of Directors taking a much stronger role in the running of MUFON, State Directors having more latitude in how they run their state business, and the International Director being a day-to-day facilita- tor of MUFON operations. We may try some things that don't work and have to adjust as we go, so I hope you will patient and supportive during this transition. Director's Message I have already had some requests for changes in how I present the Director's Message. I know that no one thing will please everyone all of the time, so I am re- questing all members to let me know what they would like to see covered in my message. Within the limits of time and space, I will try to honor the spirit of those requests. A Thank You to All MUFON Members For the past year I have been monitoring the MUFON e-mail traffic and answering telephone and written requests for information. What I have found is that we have a strong membership with a high level of interest in the investigation of UFO sightings and sup- port for more research. I have clearly heard that very few members care for the bickering and backbiting seen on the Internet and want MUFON to be above that sort of conduct and operated professionally. It is my pleasure to thank all of you for your sup- port. Some members have been with us from the be- ginning of MUFON, while others are just now join- ing. All of you are valuable and your support is appre- ciated. I hope you will each bring one new member into MUFON this year, making us the strongest and most active organization of our kind."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Page 24 August 2000 MUFON UFO Journal DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE Part I: By Walter H. Andrus, Jr. NEWS FROM AROUND THE NETWORK John F. Schuessler was inducted as International Director on July 16,2000, replacing the retiring Walter H.

Explicit instructions for changes will be placed in the MUFON UFO Journal when they become effective in order to conduct a smooth transition. Bylaws Ballot in This Issue This issue of the Journal contains a complete copy of the new/revised MUFON Bylaws for every mem- ber to read and vote on.
